This weekend's Komen Race for the Cure in Houston could see 3,000 fewer participants than in 2011 after the breast-cancer charity was thrust into a heated abortion controversy earlier this year.
In January, the Dallas-based charity announced it would stop making grants to Planned Parenthood for breast-cancer screening, prompting widespread criticism. It reversed its decision after three days.
Komen Houston says it has raised about $2 million including online, mail-in and corporate donations for the race. The charity hopes to reach its goal of $3 million - a million less than it raised last year - by Nov. 15.
A tally of donations on the Komen website shows its Houston affiliate has reached only 35 percent of its goal for this year's race as of Wednesday evening, but spokeswoman Lisa Bustamante said that only represents online pledges. She said they are hopeful to be at or near the $3 million goal by the end of the campaign.
As a result of the controversy, many Komen supporters around the country abandoned the 5K run and walk, which is the main event for the charity's fundraising. Participation dropped between 10 percent and 30 percent in some cities. The charity, however, has had a few races bring in more money and participants.
Houston's Komen affiliate could not provide exact numbers for registration for the 2012 race, set for Saturday, but acknowledged it had seen a decline since last year. As of Wednesday, the number of registrations was down 6,000 from the same time last year.
Still registering online
Affiliate spokeswoman Tania Cruz said 25,000 people have registered for the race so far and up to 30,000 could be expected to participate. In 2011, 33,000 took part, including 2,400 breast cancer survivors. The event raised more than $4 million for breast-cancer research, education, screening and treatment programs. About 3,000 people signed up between Wednesday and Saturday before last year's race.
Komen Houston did not immediately comment on why participation and fundraising are down this year. Online registration is open, and people are registering daily, Cruz said.
'We are encouraged'
Adriana Higgins, the executive director of Komen Houston Race for the Cure, said that some 80 percent of eventual participants will have registered by the weekend before the race.
"We are pretty much on target with how Houston responds," she said. "I don't think we were hit quite as hard as some areas of the country. ... We are encouraged and looking forward to a good day."
She reminded people that Komen is a fundraising and grant-making organization, with the money raised going back into the community.
Houston's Komen affiliate was established in 1990 to provide breast-cancer education, screening and treatment projects for the medically under-served and uninsured in Southeast Texas.
In its 22-year history, the affiliate has granted more than $9 million for research nationally and more than $28 million for community grants in Brazoria, Chambers, Fort Bend, Galveston, Harris, Liberty and Montgomery counties.
"We hope Houstonians show up for the race. ... We don't want to be on the political side of anything," Higgins said.

Story highlights MS-13 gang members have been indicted on 41 counts, including seven murder charges
The two slain high school students were beaten with baseball bats and a machete
(CNN) More than a dozen members of the MS-13 gang were indicted Thursday on seven killings on Long Island spanning three years, including the deaths of several high school students last year.
The US Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of New York said the 13 members of La Mara Salvatrucha, known as MS-13, face offenses including seven murder charges, racketeering, attempted murder, assault, obstruction of justice and arson in the 41-count indictment unsealed Thursday in federal court in Central Islip, New York.
"Law enforcement was determined that these brutal murders wouldn't turn into cold cases," US Attorney Robert L. Capers told reporters.
Two of the students -- Nisa Mickens, 15, and Kayla Cuevas, 16 -- were beaten with baseball bats and a machete, Capers said. The girls attended Brentwood High School in Brentwood, a working-class community in Suffolk County, about 45 miles east of New York City.
At the time, police said there appeared to be gang involvement in the girls' deaths and the deaths of two others, whose skeletal remains were found after they had been missing for months. Police have not announced arrests in the latter two deaths.

“Playing in front of my family and friends, I've waited all my life for moments like this,” Noah said.
More than any of the major team sports, an N.B.A. playoff seeding creates a fine line between what can be considered an acceptable postseason or not. The chances for an upset in the N.F.L. postseason are enhanced because it is one game. Inferior teams in baseball can rise on a hot pitcher or two. In pro basketball, a team generally gets what it deserves — or in the case of the Bulls, sans Rose, what they've been dealt.
Who can say why Rose has thus far refused to test his surgically repaired knee in game action, a year after he was injured in Game 1 of the first round? Before Monday night's game, he launched one step-back jumper after another, many hitting nothing but net.
Noah and the others, by now as mystified as the rest of us, have had no choice but to go about their business. Even were Rose to declare himself ready with the series shifting to Chicago, and if the Bulls could push past Brooklyn, their reward would be likely second-round doom against Miami.
This is also true of the Nets, who fell just short of third place in the East. That would have matched them with Atlanta, a far less formidable draw than even the injury-ravaged Bulls, and then a potential second-round series with the Knicks.
Too bad, for all basketball New York. An intracity showdown would have authenticated the nascent rivalry like nothing else. But the Nets' franchise player, Williams, struggled for months with aching ankles, perhaps exacerbated by excess weight. By the time Williams slimmed down and looked more like himself, the Nets were on their way to compiling the league's 15th-best home record, 26-15 at Barclays.
In a virtually new market, with many people rooting for marquee teams like the Knicks, the Heat and the Bulls in their handsome new building, it was probably unfair to expect the Nets to be dominant at home. Monday was a microcosm of all that, the crowd less than fevered, Williams struggling, the Nets shooting poorly and failing to hold serve.
San Francisco housing officials said Friday they have reached an agreement to purchase the notorious McDonald's at Haight and Stanyan streets, a fast-food outlet that for years has been better known for brawls and drug busts than its Big Macs.
While officials wouldn't comment on terms of the deal — the final agreement has not been signed — real estate sources said the Mayor's Office of Housing will pay about $10 million for the 38,000-square-foot parcel, which would become the site of an affordable housing complex. The property could accommodate about 90 housing units, although a developer could conceivably seek to construct more under the state affordable housing density bonus program.
“Anytime we can acquire land for affordable housing, we need to do it,” said Mayor Ed Lee. “Affordable housing — or the lack thereof — affects everyone in our city.”
A one-story building at the end of Haight Street with a 45-car parking lot, the McDonald's has long been a source of complaints from neighboring residents and business owners. Between January 2014 and April 2015, there were 640 calls to police and 11 drug busts.
The situation was so bad that City Attorney Dennis Herrera issued a clean-up order in May 2015, calling the McDonald's a public nuisance.
McDonald's and its local operator settled with the city for $40,000, agreeing to add more security and better lighting. A new franchisee, Peter Ou, took over the location in January and has done a good job cleaning up the property, said San Francisco police Capt. John Stanford of Park Station. Ou installed a new security surveillance system and meets regularly with police, fellow merchants and staff from Supervisor London Breed's office. A beat officer is regularly posted on the corner.
“With everybody working together, we have been able to reduce the crime at that location,” said Stanford, who was checking in on the property on Friday afternoon.
But problems have persisted. On Aug. 2, a 28-year-old man was shot there in the middle of the afternoon, suffering injuries that were not life-threatening.
Even if public safety has improved, city officials see the parcel as grossly underutilized and perfect for housing. Breed, who represents the area, said that she would like to see a project that includes both deeply affordable units and apartments designed for middle-income households.
“If we can pull this deal off and build affordable housing there, it would be amazing,” Breed said.
Kate Hartley, acting director of the Mayor's Office Of Housing, said that the size and location make the McDonald's site special. The last affordable housing development in the Haight neighborhood, a senior development across from Buena Vista Park at 1250 Haight St., opened in 2007.
“The neighborhood is fantastic. It's across from the park. And it's a really good size,” Hartley said. “It's a treat to have an opportunity to buy a site of this size.”
The McDonald's has frequently been associated with the largely homeless crew of teenagers and young adults who hang out in Golden Gate Park across from the restaurant. On Friday, several of the regulars sprawled on the grass there with their backpacks and dogs said that they no longer frequent the McDonald's. They prefer the Whole Foods on the other side of Haight Street.
“I'm in support of putting housing, but getting rid of the McDonald's is not going to stop the drug dealers,” said Mark Utter, who said he has been hanging out in the neighborhood for 30 years. “You could put a police station there and it's not going to change Haight Street from doing what it's always done.”
Tony Green, a manager at Amoeba Records next door, said some of his workers might miss the proximity to fast food, but residential units on the corner would be good for the neighborhood, he added.
“A lot of tourists go there, some of our employees go there, but it's safe to say that everybody who works here would be totally comfortable with housing there,” he said.

In an effort to circumvent the national gun lobby's reach and “go directly to the public,” California Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom – who is running for governor of the Golden State – on Thursday announced a sweeping proposal for next year's ballot that could potentially set a gold standard for enacting gun control.
“If we continue to fight the National Rifle Association on their home court, which is the legislative front, I think we'll continue to be frustrated,” the rising Democratic star said in a phone interview with MSNBC Thursday. “But when you have an ability to go directly to the public, that's a completely different field of engagement, and I think the NRA is not adept at that kind of engagement. They are significantly hindered because public opinion is not with them.”
“If we continue to fight the National Rifle Association on their home court, which is the legislative front, I think we'll continue to be frustrated.” California Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom
Many of the initiative's provisions were recently proposed by California lawmakers, but either failed to pass the Democratic-controlled legislature, or were vetoed by Gov. Jerry Brown, a Democrat.
“A mistake that a lot of us have made, related to those who advocate for gun safety legislation, is that we try to process it through our legislative bodies, and that's where the NRA's strength lies,” Newsom said. “There's been a gap between perception and reality, the perception being that California is on the cutting edge of gun safety legislation when, in fact, there are a number of areas where we have fallen behind.”
RELATED: Clinton, Sanders spar over guns
Newsom's proposal, which he formally unveiled Thursday at the site of a 1993 mass shooting in San Francisco, comes in the wake of several high-profile killings by gunfire, two of which took place in the Golden State. In 2014, a 22-year-old gunman went on a shooting rampage in Isla Vista, California, killing six people before taking his own life. And over the summer, a San Francisco woman named Kathryn Steinle was shot and killed with a gun that was found to have been stolen from a federal agent.
Police have charged an undocumented immigrant with Steinle's murder, prompting GOP lawmakers to seize on the case as evidence of the need for tougher immigration laws. Next week, the Senate is scheduled to vote on “Kate's Law,” a measure named after Steinle that would impose a mandatory-minimum five-year prison sentence for any undocumented immigrant who reenters the U.S. after being deported.
But while Newsom believes Steinle's death illustrates the need for comprehensive immigration reform, he also feels the conversation needs to be about guns.
“At the end of the day, there's not a day that goes by without a mass shooting,” Newsom said, referring to data compiled by the Mass Shooting Tracker. “I'm a parent. The embers of this whole effort come from my own frustration and, frankly, my own accountability.”

The issue featured prominently in this week's Democratic presidential debate, with front-runner Hillary Clinton going after her primary rival, Bernie Sanders, for not being tough enough on guns. Additionally, in the past two years, six states have closed loopholes that allowed for gun purchases without background checks — bringing to 18 the total number of states that now require background checks for some or all private firearm sales.
Two more states, Nevada and Maine, look poised to follow.
“I would like to believe that we're getting closer to that tipping point,” Newsom said. “I'm more optimistic now because it's a bottom-up approach. These reforms are not going to emanate out of a Congress that is made up of intimidated politicians. But it's much harder to intimidate the public than it is to intimidate a politician.”

California already has some of the nation's toughest gun restrictions, including a 1999 ban on assault weapons, like the AK-47. The same law also bans the importation, manufacture and sale of ammunition magazines with 11 rounds or more. But the ballot initiative goes considerably further, requiring owners of large-capacity magazines to sell them to a licensed firearms dealer, take them out of state, or turn them over to law enforcement for destruction. It would also set up a process for felons to relinquish their weapons, and require the California Department of Justice to report to the federal instant criminal background check
According to a poll conducted last month by the Public Policy Institute of California, 65% of adults said that laws covering the sale of guns should be stricter.
“I'm a parent. The embers of this whole effort come from my own frustration and, frankly, my own accountability.” California Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom launched a fundraising committee earlier this year to run for governor in 2018.
Whatever the political motivations behind Newsom's gun safety proposal, however, they appear to be secondary to his moral ones. Throughout the interview, he repeatedly referred to emotional remarks that President Obama delivered two weeks ago, after a lone gunman shot and killed nine people at a community college in Oregon. “We collectively are answerable to those families,” Obama told a roomful of reporters in the White House briefing room.
Echoing that sentiment, Newsom said: “I can't be part of the problem anymore.”
0 What happened when Orlando included kids in its city 'vision' survey
ORLANDO, Fla. - The city of Orlando spent thousands of dollars on a study largely made up of responses from children.
Children between 9 and 12 years old made up more than a quarter of the study's respondents.
Channel 9's Lori Brown asked the city why it sought input from kids for such an important study, since vision studies shape the future of a city.
Just weeks ago, the Orlando City Council approved a controversial apartment complex in College Park because it fit within the city's vision plan.
But whom the city surveyed for its Downtown Orlando Visions study might come as a surprise.
The largest age group that responded was under 20 and Channel 9 dug deeper and learned that 29 of them were between 9 and 12 years old.
“For them to be surveyed for something that could have ramifications for the rest of the city, that's an interesting way to do it," Gregory Williams, who works downtown.
Among the questions the 9-year-olds responded to: What is a common misconception about downtown Orlando?
“I don't think they would have a conception of what a misconception would be," said resident Rea Rich.
One 9-year-old's answer: "Some buildings are the same colors."
As for the question about what's missing in downtown Orlando, the kids want a water park, zoo, arcade and a football stadium. Orlando already has the Citrus Bowl.
As for the other respondents, six of them are employed by the very board that conducted the survey, which cost taxpayers $3,000.
“Taxpayers are footing the bill for a study that will only confirm what City Hall wanted to do in the first place," said Mike Cantone, with County Watch.
When asked for a word used to describe downtown Orlando, the overall group said "fun."
As if the auditorium had risen from the sands of the Sinai itself, an abandoned cinema lies in waiting for an audience that never came. A movie-worthy mirage, you'd be easily forgiven for not trusting your eyes upon stumbling such a surreal sight in the heat of the dusty Egyptian desert.
This extraordinary outdoor cinema was captured by Kaupo Kikkas, an award-winning Estonian photographer who explains the story as he heard it. After running it through Google Translate from his Estonian website, this is what I gathered from his account of what happened to the abandoned cinema of the Sinai…
Firstly, it hasn't been around that long. Kaupo says it was installed “somewhere in the beginning of this millennium”. And it wasn't built by Egyptians but rather one crazy Frenchman. As the story goes, Dynn Eadel (agreed, not a very French name) who likes to smoke a lot of cannabis (and presumably has a bit of money to throw around), was hanging out in the Sinai desert one day with his friends and decided that the one thing the place was missing was … a movie theatre! (Duh).
With the idea firmly planted in his head (and an urge to watch David Lynch's Dune on his very own cinema screen in the desert), he returned to Paris, and began working on the idea with investors. He had a special screen designed and bought all those beautiful wooden seats, additional furnishings and projector equipment off an old movie theatre in Cairo…
Soon enough, the cinema was ready and a grand party was planned for its opening. But the Frenchman forgot one thing, says Kaupo. “Egyptians do not like it when the Europeans have better ideas”. But let's just go with, ‘tension with the locals'.
Details are a little blurry, but allegedly on the night of the grand opening party, with the Sinai governor in attendance, the electric generator was mysteriously sabotaged. No film was screened that night, or any other night, ever. The Frenchman's crazy desert movie dreams fell flat, and the cinema has been left there ever since, like a monument of the Pharaohs from another dimension.
Photos and information about this place, other than Kaupo's, is strangely hard to find. It basically doesn't exist on the internet, unless it's come from him (although there is this single photograph I found on Flickr)– which, in this day and age, all strikes me as a little odd. How does a place like that remain such a well-kept secret? Is someone trying to keep it a secret? Is it even real?! Fortunately it is, and here is the original flyer for the Frenchman's cinema which was called “La Tête dans Les Etoies”, (head in the stars).
And here is trusty old Google Maps to show us exactly where it is….
Have a couple good zoom-ins and see the auditorium appear from the desert sands of the Sinai valleys… [URL link here]
If you then zoom out, you can see we're near the famous Egyptian coast of Sharm El Sheikh. The closest road is the appropriately named ‘Dusti road', but to reach the cinema, you have to take several kilometres of winding desert off-road tracks through the valley.
If you happen to be planning a trip to Egypt and would be interested in scoping this place out with a local guide who might reveal more of the story, there is one other tiny and obscure mention of the cinema I found in a Trip Advisor review, in which a couple writes about their experience with Sinai Safari.
They write: “Local guide will show you the Echo Valley, the American firing range and maybe the old abandoned Cinema – yes a full Cinema in the desert!”
That's all I got for now. But hey, it's not an adventure if you don't have to do a little searching, so I'll let you do the rest. It all seems very secretive, mysterious, and twilight zone-ish. Just the way we like it.
Here's to getting our bottoms in those seats one day, preferably with some popcorn and Lawrence of Arabia up on the big screen.

UPDATE:
It is with a very heavy heart that I have to share with you the sad news that the secret cinema of the Sinai has been destroyed. Noha Zayed, possibly a fellow reader of Messy Nessy Chic, recently took it upon herself to find the site. She took these pictures of what is left of the cinema…
“So we decided to find and visit “The cinema at the end of the world”. Upon arriving at the site we thought we got our coordinates wrong. The chairs were all knocked down as if on purpose. The place has been shattered, levelled and destroyed; the site disintegrated. It was quite a disappointment.
Sorry to burst the bubble.”
I can't understand the lack of appreciation for these beautiful old chairs. The wood has been left while the metal fixtures holding them together seem to be missing. It's likely they were stripped for their scrap metal.
It is unclear when this all took place, but I'm well aware that my article was the first to spark this cyber “renaissance” of interest in the failed cinema built in the early 2000's. Do I feel responsible? If I wasn't directly responsible for the loss of this unique place on earth, as a human being, I've certainly contributed to the loss of something else. However, perhaps more importantly so, it inspires and motivates me to seek a more pro-active role in the preservation, revival and protection of all these amazing places that I'm compelled to share with you. I hope it inspires you as well.
I'd also like to thank the efforts of the Facebook page created in the aftermath of the article going viral, which was striving to help revive the cinema. If you really feel passionate about an “at risk” place you see on Messy Nessy Chic and you'd like to share your ideas on how to help, please get in touch.
It has long been assumed that Jermichael Finley, holder of a disability insurance policy worth an untaxed $10 million, could simply collect his money if he never plays another down in the NFL. However, as with most legal matters, the truth is far more complicated.
According to a report by Yahoo! Sports reporter Rand Getlin, Finley's medical clearance from Dr. Maroon, the neurosurgeon who performed his spinal fusion surgery, may prevent the former Packers tight end from ever collecting on the policy.
While Finley's agent Blake Baratz stated back in May that his client could claim the money if he plays in less than four games, most total disability policies, such as the one Finley is understood to have, only pay out for disabilities that preclude a player from returning to the field. By receiving the green light from his surgeon, Finley may no longer be able to claim such a disability.
Chris Larcheveque, executive vice president of International Specialty Insurance, explained Finley's legal situation in Getlin's story.
"Where they hurt themselves, is they put out the theory that he's OK to play football," Larcheveque said. "Why would Lloyds [of London] pay $10 million on a disability policy if the player and his agent put in their head that he actually can play the game? Lloyds is going to tell the judge when they go to court, and they're going to go to court, that a top surgeon says he can play, and that he's not totally permanently disabled which is what he has to be to collect that money. His agent laid the foundation for Lloyds to make their argument."
Larcheveque's explanation is pretty straightforward, but he doesn't cover the likely ramifications if no NFL team signs Finley despite being cleared to play. In such a scenario, Finley and his agent would have a strong legal argument for collecting on the policy. That's not a slam dunk, however. The insurance provider could counter that because Finley's doctor is employed as the Pittsburgh Steeler's team neurosurgeon, his medical clearance also constitutes clearance from the team. As such, Finley would have to overcome an additional legal hurdle to collect on the disability policy.
Regardless, it's becoming increasingly clear that Finley's push to return to the football field may be driven by financial considerations as much as his love of the game.
In just a little over six months, the first retail sales of recreational, or "adult use," marijuana will take place. Regulations governing the new legal cannabis industry are on track to be finalized by March, with businesses sending their license applications to the Cannabis Control Commission soon after.
A Look Back At This Year
In November 2016, voters changed the law setting up legalized marijuana, but the Legislature set out to make changes to the voter-passed law.
First, lawmakers passed a six-month delay to all the provisions in the law, giving the Legislature and, eventually, the Cannabis Control Commission more time to draw up regulations to govern the new industry. Lawmakers created the Marijuana Policy Committee, which spent the first part of 2017 developing changes to the law. They held hearings all over the state developing legislation that would take control of the CCC away from the state treasurer's office, as it was originally conceived in the referendum, and give it to an independent, five-member panel whose members are appointed by the governor, attorney general and treasurer.
Legislators took issue with the original law as it was passed by voters.
"The Yes on 4 people wrote this ballot question — basically the marijuana industry. We do not let regulated industries choose how and by whom they are regulated in the commonwealth," Mark Cusack (D-Braintree), the House chairman of the Marijuana Policy Committee, said back in April. "We didn't do that with Uber and Lyft, we don't do that with private utilities, I don't see us starting with letting the marijuana industry choose how and by whom they are regulated."
For much of the legislative year, the House and Senate squabbled over how to rewrite the law. The House was in favor of a much higher tax, and more stringent limitations on the business. The Senate plan was less restrictive, and the tax was lower. Ultimately they settled on a compromise much more in line with the Senate. Lawmakers increased the tax from 12 percent, as called for in the referendum, to a total of 20 percent (17 percent to the state, and up to 3 percent to the community hosting a marijuana retail establishment). They clarified how municipalities can opt out of having marijuana businesses within their borders, by making it slightly easier for communities that rejected the marijuana initiative in 2016 to institute a ban. They restricted advertising and packaging to minors, and called for making sure communities disproportionately affected by the war on drugs are not cut out of taking part in the new industry.
The changes were accepted by Gov. Charlie Baker, who was an opponent of the referendum that legalized recreational marijuana. He seemed to begrudgingly accept that "the voters had spoken" and was happy to let the Legislature make the changes they wanted.
"I worry terribly about what the consequences over time will be," said Baker moments after signing the bill in his office. "And having spent a lot of time talking to folks in Colorado and in Washington, and in having talked to a lot of people who have talked to folks in Colorado and in Washington, there are a lot of pitfalls we need to work hard to avoid."
By the end of summer, the Cannabis Control Commission was finally in place, and it began taking steps to draw up policy to govern the new, legalized industry. With state law mandating they must have regulations in place by March 15, the CCC has been facing a time crunch, but has adopted a number of policies and draft regulations.
Steven Hoffman, chairman of the Cannabis Control Commission, speaks during its first meeting in September 2017. (Jesse Costa/WBUR)
Looking Ahead To 2018
The CCC decided they will issue social use licenses, making Massachusetts the first state to do so. It's not clear at this point if smoking will be allowed at those locations, however the CCC has vowed to make a decision on smoking by Oct. 1, 2018, at the latest, after considering the effects of secondhand smoke and workplace safety.
The commission is also planning on accepting applications for micro-businesses and craft cannabis cultivators. They are also, as required by the law, reaching out to those communities disproportionately affected by past marijuana laws.
One of the big questions lingering as 2018 is about to begin: Will there be plenty of marijuana shops open July 1?
That's a bit unclear. It is likely that the 17 existing medical marijuana establishments will be allowed to convert to retail sales. One problem facing the industry could be supply. Cultivators might not have enough time to grow an adequate amount of cannabis to meet demand. That could spell shortages and initially high prices soon after the doors open to retail sales.
The chairman of the Cannabis Control Commission, Steven Hoffman, is trying to tamp down some expectations, saying not to expect things to be like they are in other states that have legalized right out of the gate.
"We're not going to snap our fingers and have Colorado. What Colorado is now four years after passing their initiative, we're not going to be there on July 1," Hoffman said in October. "We will get there, but I think it's just important to, as I said, set expectations that we're not going to have Colorado on July 1st of 2018." He is predicting a robust industry will eventually emerge. It's just going to take some time.

TPI Composites in Newton announced Friday that it plans to add 350 jobs in the next two years to manufacture lightweight bus components.Frank Leibel with Newton Development Corp. confirmed the expansion to KCCI.TPI currently manufactures wind turbine components in Newton and will take over the old Maytag Plant number 2, giving the company 100,000 square feet of manufacturing space.The company will manufacture lightweight bus bodies for a company called Proterra in that space."As a community, we got together when we knew Whirlpool and Maytag were gonna leave,” Liebl said. “We've got to find a way. We've got to diversify economic base, and so we've been able to do that."TPI will create 109 new jobs next year, and ramp up to 350 jobs within two years."It's about time they started doing something in this town (and) getting jobs back in here,” Newton resident Pamela Small said.TPI was one of the first companies to relocate to Newton the company built a facility to produce wind turbines and employed Iowans from 68 different communities.Now, the company plans to lease a portion of the former Maytag factory to build bodies for electric buses."As a community, we got together when we knew Whirlpool and Maytag were gonna leave,” Liebl said. “We've got to find a way. We've got to diversify economic base, and so we've been able to do that."Liebl said he believes the expansion will be huge for Newton, and community members who spoke with KCCI agreed."I think it's gonna bring the community closer together (and) bring people to the community to find work who don't have it,” lifetime Newton resident Bauston Van Sickle said."I just think it's a big positive for us and I know that we have people working very, very hard to bring these businesses in and we appreciate everything that they're doing to do that,” Newton resident Sharon Black said.Officials said hiring should come out near the first of the New Year and that they hope to have the first bus body built around April of 2018.The buses will go to cities, college campuses and airports across the country.

Derelict putting greens will be put to greener uses in Japan, where an abandoned golf course near Kyoto is being converted to the area's largest solar energy-generating facility.
Solar power production represents an ideal type of landscape reuse in this context for many reasons: expansive areas with little shade and high sun exposure are perfect for laying out panels for maximum effect and efficiency. Developed by Kyocera, “the plant will generate an estimated 26,312 megawatt hours (MWh) per year — enough electricity to power approximately 8,100 typical local households.”
Also under construction, a similar project in the Kagoshima Prefecture is being located on an area originally cleared for a golf course that was never finished and occupied. Critical to a country facing power issues in the wake of the Fukushima nuclear incident, these projects are also a sign of land use awareness and changing times. Just a few decades ago country club memberships sold for millions in Japan, but “overdevelopment of golf properties during the real-estate boom of the 1990's and 2000's has led to hundreds of idle courses today that are now under analysis for repurposing or redevelopment.”
Of course, closed golf courses are also an international problem well beyond the Japanese archipelago, giving this solution potentially global applications as well, particularly in the United States. Together, these projects should help inspire other countries to turn some of the most environmentally unsound landscapes toward more productive and sustainable uses.
'Brave New Workers': A Texas Cowboy Finds Fortune In The Wind
Enlarge this image toggle caption Courtesy of Lanny Copeland Courtesy of Lanny Copeland
Growing up on the plains of West Texas, Lanny Copeland says there weren't too many options for a young man looking to make a living.
"If you weren't a farmer," Copeland says, "chances were pretty good you were in the oil field."
But from early on, he knew what he wanted to be when he grew up — to follow in his father's footsteps as a cowboy and ranch manager.
"You felt like you were a part of history," Copeland says, "taking part in the great Texas cattle industry."
After studying range land management and animal husbandry at Texas A&M, Copeland spent years wrangling cattle for other owners, until one day in the mid-1990s he and his father were offered the opportunity to buy out part of their boss' herd, to begin a business of their very own.
"To have something of our own was the greatest feeling in the world to me," says Copeland. "And I think to Daddy as well, because he had developed this herd of cattle, and he had managed this land for so long."
For 10 years, things went well for the Copelands. Despite intermittent seasons of low rainfall, they managed to keep their herd healthy, and their operation afloat. But in the mid-2000s, a prolonged drought finally proved too much.
"Even with the best herd you can put together," Copeland says, "if the weather doesn't cooperate and the drought doesn't break, at some point, it doesn't matter."

Copeland and his father were forced to cut their losses and sell off their remaining cattle and equipment.
"I found myself at 44 years old, really wondering what in the world am I going to do now," he says, "because this is pretty much all I've ever done."
For months, Copeland struggled to find a new line of work, hoping to secure a new means of supporting a daughter in college and a son in junior high. Until one day, in the late winter of 2008, Copeland came across a notice for a wind energy job fair, hosted by a power company called Invenergy, at a Lubbock, Texas, hotel. Copeland thought he might be one of five or six attendees, and decided to give it a shot.
Instead, Copeland says he found a room packed with over a hundred prospective applicants, many of them decades younger than him.
"I felt pretty old in that room because there were a lot of 25-year-old guys with applications in their hands," Copeland says.
Nevertheless, he submitted his application and hoped for the best. Not too long afterwards, he received a call from a hiring manager, inviting him to visit one of the company's facilities for an aptitude test and to take a mandatory climb test. When the manager asked about whether he would be able to climb one of the towering turbines, he says he was honest about his misgivings.
"I remember telling him, 'I have no idea if I can do it,' " says Copeland, "didn't like heights much anyway and said, 'yeah, we'll see.' "
Sure enough, when he arrived, the task seemed daunting. "That was the longest ladder I'd ever seen in my life," he says.

In the end, Copeland made it easily to the top of his first wind turbine, and when he did, he says he found a beautiful landscape waiting below. Looking out over an expanse of rolling ranch lands, sprinkled with wind turbines, Copeland says he knew that he had found something worth pursuing.
"I remember thinking — 'not many people have ever done this,' " says Copeland.
Copeland passed that turbine climbing test, and now, nine years later, he works as an Operations and Maintenance Manager for Invenergy, overseeing two wind farms and 27 wind turbine technicians in Texas.
Copeland says he was lucky to find his way into the Texas wind industry when he did. Texas currently produces the most wind energy of any state in the country, and earlier this year "wind turbine technician" was named the fastest growing job in the U.S. economy by the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
As for Lanny Copeland, he says he's striking a balance between his old professional identity and his new one.
"Do I still see myself as a cowboy?" Copeland asks. "Yeah, I do. And I hope I always do." Still, Copeland says, he's thrilled to have found a new life for himself in the booming Texas wind industry.
"It's the future," he says. "Wind energy is the future."
Here's how the newspaper put it in one article:
... a Houston Chronicle investigation has found misuse of force by staff against inmates is prevalent and hard to prove, especially when jail staff file charges against inmates in altercations during which their own actions have been called into question. Between 2009 and May of this year, the Harris County Sheriff's office has pursued charges more than 900 times against inmates for harassment, assault and other crimes against public servants stemming from incidents within the jail, according to court records. With the U.S. Department of Justice's Civil Rights Division continuing its review of excessive force by jail staff and pursuing an “ongoing law enforcement proceeding” in the jail, the Chronicle found that jail staff members have been disciplined in more than 120 incidents for misuse of force and other abuses of authority since 2009, records show. Several of those disciplined have been involved in dozens of inmate prosecutions.
These oft-disciplined guards are demonstrably untrustworthy. Yet their word is good enough to convict men of jailable offenses. Grave injustices are surely a result. The newspaper investigation noted other cases of video contradicting the narrative of jail guards. And it found “14 Harris County deputies and sergeants with disciplinary histories related to use of force incidents who filed charges in 50 separate cases in which inmates were charged with crimes against jail staff since 2009.”
Keep that year in mind.
The series also found “eight cases in which inmates were choked, punched or kicked by detention officers and then ended up facing felony charges for alleged crimes against staff members, even though jailers were later disciplined for misconduct in connection with the same incidents.” And it reported that since 2009, “fifty-five inmates died in the jail while awaiting adjudication,” never receiving the day in court that is their constitutional right. The jail system has failed to prevent suicides, too, sometimes due to breaches in protocol that violate federal law.
Summing up the status quo in Harris County, the criminal-justice blog Grits for Breakfast wrote:
If you're too poor to post bond in Houston, your bail hearing will be a joke, with no lawyer to represent or speak up for you. You might get sick in jail or be beaten by a guard then convicted of a felony for assaulting him. Even if you're innocent. And if despair overtakes you and you attempt suicide, maybe no one will be there to stop you; perhaps they'll even falsify records to cover up their negligence.
It would be comforting to think that this jail system's problems are due to the myopia of local leaders, and that the revelation of these serious problems will directly lead to improvements.
But this same jail system was investigated by the Department of Justice back in 2009. And numerous shortcomings were documented in a formal report. The findings are here.

individuals who knew well that the full benefit of what
they were investing in – often without a commemora-
tive marble plaque – would be realised only after their
lifetimes.
So if anyone says that we need to thank the Ameri-
cans for this philanthropy bug, then you know what to
say. Take a … okay, sorry, give for a change. I mean
literally.
So what's new?
The scale. For centuries, the concept of daan/
philanthropy was something you expensed out of your
books after you had taken care of your needs for the
number of years until the projected end of your life…
multiplied by five. This amount would be fairly ade-
quate to build the ashrams, ghats and dharamshalas.
The one thing that has now changed is the sheer
quantum of this spending. The sectoral space is no after-
thought; it is a veritable industry. The space does not
just employ a munim (accountant) but caregivers, exec-
utives, consultants and support staff. The space does
not just focus on things that can be fixed in the neigh-
bourhood but people willing to bet grandiose on eradi-
cating national poverty, disease and illiteracy. And,
best of all, the space is no longer about investing for an
intangible return (satisfaction, what else) but some im-
mediate tangible evidence as well (polio eradication).
And, finally, the space is no longer open-ended; it is fo-
cused, professionalised and documented.
The context
Oh, there is something else that is new. Earlier, bal-
anced individuals spent a part of their income towards
public good. The new boy on the philanthropic block is
the corporate, which either assumes projects directly
or funds reliable NGOs.
This philanthropic nudge is coming from India's
Companies Bill 2013 as well. The Bill mandates that
companies, with a net worth of more than Rs500
crores or revenue of more than Rs1,000 crores or net
profit of more than Rs5 crores, to earmark at least 2
per cent of their average net profits of the preceding
three years for corporate social responsibility (CSR) ac-
tivities.
This comes at a time when even within corporates,
there is an emerging divergence – corporates belonging
to new age sectors marked by high margin, zero debt
and high cash business models, who are simply embar-
rassed by the largeness of their profits on the one hand
and shortness of the tenure on the other.
From within these corporates three trends have
emerged – one, thought leadership; two, walking their
talk; three, their senior executives spinning philan-
thropic initiatives following the divestment of a part of
their ownership in their highly valued organisations.
So you have IT tycoon Azim Hashim Premji donat-
ing Rs8,000 crores in the past year, Mr G.M. Rao
(through GMR Varalakshmi Foundation) donating
Rs740 crores for the education of underprivileged chil-
dren, the Nilekanis (Nandan and Rohini) contributing
Rs530 crores, Mr Ronnie Screwvala contributing
Rs470 crores for achieving rural empowerment
through the best practices and modern technology val-
ues, Ms Kiran Mazumdar-Shaw donating Rs330 crores,
Mr Ratan Tata donating Rs310 crores to various chari-
table organisations followed by Mr Anil Agarwal,
Mr P.N.C. Menon, Mr Kushal Pal Singh and others.
The brand-enriching result is that Infosys is not just
about the magic of market capitalisation; it is a compa-
ny that showed modern India the philanthropic way.
Wipro is not just about a company that has endured
through challenges; it is about a company that is
putting down big money to eradicate illiteracy. Tata
Steel or JSW are not just companies that make steel
(terrible cliche); they are companies that nurse entire
townships, communities and culture.
The ad hocism
One would then think that given the evident connect
between branding and philanthropy, a number of cor-
porates would be willing to divert some of their brand
spend towards initiatives of social responsibility. Inter-
estingly, that has yet to happen in India. Industrialists
have been hesitant philanthropists partly because they
are still payback-obsessed in a space where the returns
are largely non-financial; a number of them excuse
themselves by insisting that their CSR is really the em-
ployment stability that they provide which helps stimu-
late the local economy; a number also feel that in the
slowdown they should be strengthening their business
than engaging in non-essentials.
So the CSR of large organisations helps them keep
up with the Joneses; much of mid-cap India is engaged
in ad hoc spending dictated by the mood; most
small-cap companies engage in absolutely no philan-
thropy except for advertising in event souvenirs or
sponsoring local tournaments to buy terrain peace.
The gaps
It might appear that the corporate is the villain – “they
have the money but they won't have the heart to
spend it” syndrome. The reverse argument is also
worth considering. In a positioning-driven world, most
NGOs just do not know how to place a proposal that
will get a corporate to say “yes”. These NGOS are so
activity-focused that “branding” and “marketing” ap-
pear sinful. Most NGOs cannot write a proposal that
even explains in simple language how the world would
be a poorer place if they ceased to exist. Much of Indi-
an NGO collateral is badly written and designed. Peri-
od.
Besides, most NGOs work as silos; most are patheti-
cally networked; most are generally complaining that
they are under-resourced; most associate the word “in-
novation?” with what chemists do in laboratories;
most depend largely on the largesse of foreigners with-
out realising that a goldmine lies within their own coun-
try; some engage in practices that are downright unethi-
cal (but why get into that here?).
But let me come back to the corporates. Most corpo-
rates who engage in philanthropy spend no time study-
ing the space they want to grow in, as a result of which
they commit funds first, realise later that they over-ex-
tended, have too much of an ego to retract and the re-
sult is that they soon become top-heavy whereas some-
one else does a far better job with a lower outlay.
Besides, most corporates lack linkage. For instance,
a corporate will teach; when it comes to providing psy-
chological counselling – often a requirement if you are
teaching at the lowest slab of the economic pyramid –

MUDAR PATHERYA
ONE of the best instances about passionate giving revolves
around someone I have known for nearly three decades.
Former Test cricketer Arun Lal (right).
Arun had a presswalla, someone who would iron
clothes for him. One day, the presswalla went to Arun and
his wife Reena with an unusual request: His son had been
admitted to an English medium school (Julien Day School)
in Kolkata – by itself unusual for someone from an
underprivileged background – and needed help with
conversational English.
After initial hesitation (“We thought he would be here
today and gone tomorrow”) Arun and Reena took the boy
in; he would, as per the arrangement, go to the couple for
an hour a day of language familiarisation.
Gradually, the brief extended; Reena started covering
more subjects. Not merely as in “covering” them. “It got
to a point when, if we wanted to go on a holiday,” says
Arun, “Reena would decline saying ‘Oh, but Bikash has his
exams coming up.”
Two things began to unfold gradually: Bikash started
spending more time with the couple, including having a
meal before going home to spend each night on the
pavement off Northern park (Bhowanipore). A few years
later, the couple started liking the boy enough to formally
propose an active support arrangement with his parents'
consent and get him to move in with them.
And that is what happened: Bikash would spend the
day either in school or at the Lals' residence off upmarket
Ballygunge Circular Road in Kolkata just like a family
member, but each night he would zip down for dinner
with his family of origin, remaining connected with where
he came from.
From school, Bikash moved to Assembly of God
Church for his plus-two and thereafter was good enough
to be admitted to St Xavier's College for his B.Com.
“We did something interesting for him at that point,”
says Arun. “We got him to sit for CAT tutorials so that he
would get into the groove of competitive examinations.
We said, don't worry if you fail, just get the experience.”
Bikash failed the first time. Tried again. Cleared the
examination this time. Got a call from IIM Bangalore and
IIM Kolkata. Went for the latter.
The general Lal family apprehension: In a
mathematically-oriented institution, Bikash might not be
able to take the heat.
Bikash surprised. In his first year at what is rated as the
second best IIM in India, Bikash was elected Lord by his
seniors; the following year he was elected president, an
unlikely combination for most IIM-ers and an unusual
combination for someone just middling academically.
Bikash's next big break was when Deutsche Bank
visited the campus to select recruits for summer training in
London. Bikash sent in his application for a lark. From
among dozens who had sent in their papers, Bikash was
selected. When he finished his two-year course, Deutsche
Bank took him in. Bikash now works for a large French
investment banking company in Mumbai.
“One of the most moving moments in our relationship,”
said Arun, “came when we wanted to move from an
apartment into a bungalow and did not have enough
money to make it happen.
“One day we received an envelope by courier from
Mumbai, opened it to find a demand draft from Bikash for
the remaining – significant – amount.
“On another occasion, I returned from some place to
find two young ladies outside my residence. They
motioned me to my garage and standing there was a silver
grey Mercedes presented to us by Bikash for getting him
where he is today.”
So what's the take big message?
Reena encapsulates: “Most will see Bikash as the
beneficiary. The reverse is true; we gained more than him
and in a non-material way. We became more aware of the
inequality around us; it gave us the confidence to
financially support four more deserving youngsters
through college and the result is that they are on their way
to becoming doctors.”
Arun concludes: “A number of my friends are willing to
fund me create an NGO that does only this – support
deserving underprivileged children – as they feel that by
now I have acquired some core competence in this subject.
“The reality is that this model does not respond to scale
or mere financial infusion; one must feel strongly to give a
part of one's life, time, emotion and money to provide an
opportunity to someone who can probably do more with
life's chances than I can.
“But despite most of us having more than enough for
this existence, we pay lip service and do little to help
someone transforms his destiny and those of his succeeding
generations.
“And that is where the real tragedy lies.”

All hail the new king!
After two seasons of being runner-up to Carey Price, P.K. Subban inherits the top spot in our annual Top 25 Under 25.
In just his second full season in the NHL, Subban demonstrated that he will be the workhorse of the future for the Montreal Canadiens' blue line. With Andrei Markov's return to the lineup in the 2011-12 season delayed until it was practically over, the go-to man was the 22-year-old Toronto native.
Was there a sophomore jinx? Absolutely not.
Despite his goal total cut in half, his point production was just two points off his rookie campaign and he spent nearly a combined two full games on the ice longer than his blue line partner Josh Gorges. His lone missed game was an unexplainable benching by interim coach Randy Cunneyworth, that the Habs wound up losing to the Winnipeg Jets (coincidentally the only game this year where the Habs didn't trounce the Jets).
His average 24:18 per game on the ice last season was just over two minutes more than in 2010-11, and good for 18th among NHL defensemen. For his age it is rather good company, considering just five other NHL rearguards, with three or fewer full seasons under their belt, saw more ice time than Subban. Breaking it down, 2:36 of his per game ice time came on the penalty kill and another 3:29 came with the man advantage.
Subban was among a group of gems drafted by the Canadiens in 2007, with Max Pacioretty and now New York Rangers defenseman Ryan McDonagh drafted ahead of him.
The Habs could have easily missed out on him. Just imagine if the Los Angeles Kings (not that they needed it) had made a different choice with the No. 4 pick that year, rather than taking Thomas Hickey, or how much further ahead the Edmonton Oilers would have been if they took Subban over Alex Plante at No. 15.
To close out this year's Top 25, we will have input from a few of our EOTP contributors, giving a complete picture of the new Number One.
Voting was almost unanimous for the top spot. Justin Dahan was the lone panelist not to give Subban a top vote, though the did give him a second place finish.

Those familiar with Chris Boucher's statistical breakdown can take a gander at this compilation he provided. It clearly demonstrates how important Subban's play was, in several key areas, notably among Canadiens defensemen.
Andrew Berkshire did some research into No. 76's performance as well. We're getting a bit of a sneak peak here, as we'll be seeing these graphics in the coming days.
Andrew explains what we are looking at in better detail:
Graphed here are rolling 10 game averages of Subban's game by game Fenwick percentage, which is a proxy for performance, and his offensive zone start percentage, which is a proxy for his role on the team, and how difficult it is. The higher the blue line is, the better Subban's performance was. The higher the red line is, the easier his job was. I've added a trend line for each statistic, which shows that over time Subban's performance has dipped, but not to the same extent to which his role became more difficult. Because we're dealing with proxies, there are variables left out, such as how much ice time Subban was playing (more and more as the games go on), and how badly Randy Cunneyworth's system hurt Subban's possession numbers, among others. However what we have is a simple and clear graph showing that Subban consistently outperforms his role, something Olivier Bouchard has noted is a good indicator of success.
Strengths: Subban has a booming slap shot that he gets to the net often. Even when it's stopped, the velocity he gets on the puck creates chances for his teammates. But he is not a one dimensional player in the offensive zone, as the young defenseman has good vision and is adept at deciding whether to pass, shoot or make a deke. Chris Boucher points out that Subban's choice to deke was double that of any other blueliner. His preference was to pass in 2011-12, doing that 49 percent of the time in the offensive end. Subban still managed 205 shots on goal, fourth on the team. That combination of numbers demonstrates how strong his possession dominance was from an offensive point of view.
But to get to the offensive end, Subban usually starts at the other end of the rink, where he is highly efficient with the first pass. He was fourth in team pass completion percentage, but realize that he had a much larger total of pass attempts than any other Canadiens defender, and that Markov's numbers came off a small sample last season.
If he can't pass it, Subban has no issue bringing the puck out himself. He is very difficult to get off the puck, once his momentum starts, and often uses his strong body as a shield against forecheckers to carry it out, sometimes with one hand.
Perhaps Subban's greatest strength is that he has great hockey sense. This combined with his foot speed and strength allows him to take risks that other defenders wouldn't even consider, because he can recover from mistakes rather easily. Over the last two years we've seen Subban anticipate plays on 2-on-1 plays against and make perfect reads to break them up constantly. His timing with stick checking also went from good to great while he was partnered with Hal Gill in 2010-11.
Weaknesses: Nothing major to be worried about overall, but there are still a couple glitches in Subban's game that we saw in last year's analysis. Typically it falls into the whole risk reward category. He still tends to go for the big hit, which can take him out of the play, but has been more decisive in that area.
Subban will take risks offensively, especially if he chooses to go in alone, that can be uneventful or produce a turnover. The former of those two arguments can be attested to little support from all but a handful of his forwards last season and reflected on his overall scoring numbers.
Mixing his shot selection up may be worth looking at too. He relied completely on his slap shot with the man advantage, which is to be expected in that situation. Given his wrist shot is highly effective, and often underrated, he might want to try slipping a few of those in now and then to make defenders guess a little more.
Discipline wise, he still takes foolish penalties out of aggravation and agitation.. His PIM numbers were similar to 2010-11, and his overall penalties taken to those drawn, over 60 minutes, was relatively the same. He's still a kid though, so the maturity curve should balance that out to the more favourable side as the years go on.
Projection: Well he's established himself as a top 2 defenders, that we can agree upon wholeheartedley. Now we will see if he can get to a more elite level. Subban will be in his third full season with the Canadiens, and that year seems to be the breakout season for the majority of defensemen in the NHL.
For comparison, I put up Subban's numbers to that of a few notables in their first three full seasons (min 50 games).

Stephan Cooper also did some more advanced analysis of Subban back in August, putting him fourth among his peers, comparing him to those drafted from 2007 onward.
He's already padded on an extra 14 pounds of muscle in the off-season, so we can expect his performance at both ends to do nothing but continue to improve. A Norris Trophy is within his reach in his future.
But the big question is now, "How long and how much?" Still a Restricted Free Agent, and with the lockout looming, we still have to wait and see how many years P.K. Subban will be locked up for in Le Tricolore. We know that he loves the City of Montreal and playing for the Canadiens, and the fans who come back will be happy to see him there for a long, long time.
A New York man is tending to a black eye after he was allegedly punched on the subway because he looks like Shia LaBeouf, PEOPLE confirms.
Mario Licato, 26, tells PEOPLE he was walking down the subway stairs at the corner of Essex and Delancey streets on Saturday while going to a friend's show when a man suddenly punched him.
“I just saw a fist coming at my face,” Licato says. “And the next thing I know I was, like, falling down the stairs and all I heard was, ‘That's because you look exactly like Shia LaBeouf.' ”
Licato tells PEOPLE that he was “out cold” for a second and awoke to find his face covered in blood and his glasses broken. He says a couple who witnessed the incident described the assailant as a six-foot or six-foot-three, muscular, “white frat boy.”

“I was like, ‘Am I crazy? Or did he just say that happened because I look like Shia LaBeouf?' And they were like, ‘That's exactly what he said,” Licato recounts.
He says the couple helped him to his feet and both the police and EMT officials arrived. Authorities plan to look at surveillance photos from the location, Licato says, adding that he hopes “they figure out who the crazy person was.”
Get push notifications with news, features and more.
Police are investigating the incident as an assault and no arrests have been made, a New York Police Department spokesperson tells PEOPLE. Licato says that if police track down his alleged attacker, he'd ask the man a few questions.
“I would basically just say, ‘So what did Shia LaBeouf ever do to you that you wanted to punch him in the face? Was it one of his performance pieces?‘ ” he says. “Did this guy steal his girlfriend? Like, what did he do so bad that he wanted to punch somebody that looked like him?”
The 26-year-old says he has been told he resembles the embattled actor “a bunch of times” – “10 times I would say, at least,” Licato tells PEOPLE.
Licato, who says his left eye is swollen but healing, took to Instagram over the weekend, posting a photo of the injury.
“I wanna thank the guy who randomly decided he needed to hit me last night,” Licato wrote alongside the photo.
” ‘This happened bc you look exactly like Shia LaBeouf.' Well sir you boosted my self esteem bc he's p hot.”
Eugene Yoon says he was inspired by Ellen Degeneres to "be kind to one another." The one he chose to be kind to was Arthur Renowitzky. (Published Sunday, Nov. 1, 2015)
Castro Valley Man Hikes Pacific Crest Trail, Raises Tens Of Thousands So Paralyzed Stranger Take First Steps In Years
It is traditionally the bride who gets walked down the aisle at a wedding.
Arthur Renowitzky has something different in mind for his, though.
If he gets married one day, he wants Eugene Yoon to walk with him. Why? Because, Renowitzky says, he wouldn't be walking at all right now if it weren't for Yoon.
"He has sacrificed so much for me," Renowitzky said of his friend.
Yoon recently completed a six month, through-hike of the Pacific Crest Trail, covering more than 2,600 miles from the Mexican to Canadian borders. In the process, Yoon raised tens of thousands of dollars to help Renowitzky purchase a ReWalk, a powered exoskeleton which enables paraplegics to stand and walk.
Yoon said he battled through isolation, severe weather, and hunger to complete the trail. "All worth it, if it means Arthur gets to walk," said Yoon.
The 28-year-old Renowitzky was paralyzed when shot by a mugger in the parking lot of a San Francisco nightclub in 2007. Refusing to accept a doctor's assessment that he would likely never walk or talk again, Renowitzky has gone on to become a advocate for the disabled: founding the non profit Life Goes On Foundation, speaking out against gun violence, and visiting newly paralyzed patients to reassure them that, indeed, life does go on.
"Just an incredibly inspirational person," Yoon said.
Yoon, from Castro Valley, had learned of Renowitzky's non profit work through his social media postings. He also learned that Renowitzky's dream of one day walking came with it a hefty price tag: $80,000 for the ReWalk.
At the time, Yoon, who says he was inspired by talk show host Ellen Degeneres to "be kind to one another," was looking for someone he could do a good deed for. Having never met Renowitzky before, Yoon made up his mind to hike the PCT and raise the money Renowitzky needed.
"What type of person does something like that?" Renowitzky said.
Yoon left on his adventure in April, reaching the Canadian border mid-October. The highlight of the trek wasn't the finish, though, Yoon said. It came two weeks earlier when he received a message that he and Renowitzky had reached their fundraising goal and Renowitzky had purchased his ReWalk.
"I can remember that moment like it was yesterday," Yoon said. He recorded a video on the spot, screaming "We did it!" at the top of his lungs.
Still, Yoon was most looking forward to seeing Renowitzky use his ReWalk in person. He got that chance this week at Fairmont Hospital in San Leandro.
"This is unreal," Yoon said watching Renowitzky use the device to walk down the hallway of the hospital's rehab unit.
"I wouldn't be here without you," Renowitzky added. "You know that, don't you?"
UPDATE According to BBC.co.uk at 11AM Sunday the young man was aged 20 and has been named by his family as Rashan Jermaine Charles.
The Metropolitan police has claimed that a young black man who died in the London borough of Hackney in the early hours of Saturday morning was “taken ill” after “trying to swallow an object” and that a police officer “intervened and sought to prevent the man from harming himself”.
But video circulating on social media appears to tell a different story. [Link removed due to coroner anonymity ruling.]
The video shows the young man, who has been identified as “Rashman”, walking down the aisle of a shop.
A uniformed police officer grabs him from behind and pulls him backwards.
The young, slightly built, black man appears to put up no resistance.
The officer then appears to throw the young man to the floor, chest down, landing heavily on top of him. He then appears to apply a headlock. The young man's legs can be seen moving.
At 1 minute 12 seconds a second officer, in plain clothes, joins the restraint, appearing to sit astride the young man, pinning his legs down, while the first officer handcuffs him from behind. [See note* below]
At about 1 minute 45 seconds the man appears to stop moving, both officers look into his face, and the uniformed officer shakes him. The restraint continues.
In the closing moments of the video, at around 2 minutes 20 seconds, the uniformed officer stands up. The plain clothes officer appears to continue the restraint. (A longer, 3 minute 52 second, version of the video appeared on Youtube late on Sunday afternoon. Rashman is still under restraint by the end of it.)
A shop worker apparently witnesses the restraint. There is no audio of the incident. The video's audio track carries sounds of the shop till and people chatting, presumably at the front of the shop.
The video was posted on Twitter by @_coinz at 11.16pm on Saturday 22 July and has been shared using the hashtags #Rashman #justiceforrashman and #JusticeForRash .
Here is the BBC's Sunday 7.30AM report in full:
The Met Police said the man was followed on foot after officers tried to stop a car in Kingsland Road, Hackney, at 01:45 BST on Saturday.
He was "taken ill" after "trying to swallow an object" and was pronounced dead in hospital a short time later, the force said.
The Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) has been informed.
Footage apparently showing the incident has been shared on social media, along with the hashtag #JusticeForRash.
Police said the officer "intervened and sought to prevent the man from harming himself".
A force medic provided first aid at the scene before London Ambulance Service paramedics arrived.
The man, who has not been named, was taken to an east London hospital and pronounced dead at 02:55.
Police said next of kin had been informed and a post-mortem examination and formal identification would be "arranged in due course".
"The Directorate of Professional Standards and the Independent Police Complaints Commission have been informed and have declared the incident independent," a force spokesman added.
People have shared pictures of Rashman on social media.
*NOTE: We have removed the link to the video shared on social media, due to the Coroner's anonymity ruling, and replaced it with a pixellated version published by the Guardian. Timings differ. According to an IPCC update on 25 July 2017: “The officer restrained Mr Charles, with assistance from a member of the public.” See: On the lethal restraint of young black Londoner, Rashan Charles.
Actress Uqasha Senrose (left) drew her fans' displeasure after deciding to do away with the tudung. — Picture from Facebook/Uqasha Senrose
KUALA LUMPUR, Aug 29 — Fans of popular Malay actress Uqasha Senrose have turned on her and accused the 23-year-old of “deriding” Islam after she decided to stop wearing a headscarf.
After donning the headscarf over the last three years, her decision to go without one has been met with fierce criticism, mostly from her male followers, who took to her Facebook page and accused her of being “undignified” and a “hypocrite.”
“You've lost your dignity as a Muslim, so you will also lose your fans because your fans are looking to go to heaven and not to hell,” fan Ahmad Faisal Ahmad Ziad posted.
“I really pity you. Why is your heart so black. Until you're willing to play with religion,” another social media user Akil Mustafa Madu said.
While most of the comments were negative, Uqasha did receive support from some of her female fans who urged others to let the young actress make her own decision.
“Maybe this is for the best for Uqasha so be patient. There is no point to force people as it will be difficult if they're not sincere. Let it be, it's her life and her decision, we don't need to mind other people's decision,” user Diah Armanda said.
“The decision is in each individual's hands, don't question other people's rights when even we are not so great! In fact, we should help them, not just point out their missteps or mistakes, we are no better,” a Facebook user who went by the moniker “Satu Arah” said.
Most of her Facebook fans express regret over the actress' decision to remove her headscarf after she reportedly decided not to “pretend” anymore.
The actress who starred in the stage version of Ombak Rindu had told Malay daily Berita Harian that she first donned the tudung after experiencing a broken heart and that her decision to take it off now was solely between her and God.

Iraqi Army, the Counterterrorism units, the Federal police, and Anbar tribes entered the city of Ramadi that was occupied by the self-proclaimed “Islamic State” group (ISIS) for several months. To their biggest surprise, only few bodies of the terrorist group were found when intelligence gathering by the U.S led coalition and the Iraqi intelligence service confirmed the presence of around 2000 fighters in the city until days before the final assault. Six ISIS were arrested while trying to flee Ramadi among the 442 civilians who left the city one day before the final assault on the city center.
The same phenomena of “ISIS evaporation” was registered in Sinjar when 7500 Kurds, supported by the U.S Air Force, occupied the key northern Iraqi city, finding a very small number of ISIS fighters in it.
So where did all these ISIS fighters go too?
A high-ranking source within the Iraqi government told me “the US forces operating in Iraq within the military operation room in Baghdad are the one who define the units and the time (day and hour) of attack against ISIS. If we want to benefit from an Air Force to defeat the terrorist group, we should bow to the American command. It is not unlikely for a possible American – Turkish coordination to communicate with “ISIS” and give a free way out to fighters to withdraw in the direction of the Syrian – Iraqi borders. That's the information our drones collected in the last few days prior the attack of Ramadi. Our signal and Human Intelligence informed the Americans and us about ISIS movement of troops. We were not allowed to engage against these and no one in the government can contradict the Americans for the moment. The U.S ordered Baghdad to keep al-Hashd al-Sha'bi (PMUs) away from the battlefield of Anbar perhaps to ensure a free passage to ISIS and to reduce the Iranian influence and credit of victories in Iraq”.
“America has asked decision makers in Baghdad to change the heads of anti-terrorism, intelligence and security services of the army and Interior Ministry. Moreover, the Secretary General of the Council of Minister was also kind of suggested by the Americans and in consequences he has been appointed to this position. The U.S wants a homogeneous team that is friendly to its policy and presence of these (US forces) on the ground in Iraq. The hostile Era – created by the former Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki that led to a withdrawal of the forces from Mesopotamia – is over and the policy adopted at the moment consists in reducing the influence of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) Maj. Gen. Qassem Soleimani over few Iraqi armed groups. What is contributing to the success of such a policy is the fact that the Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi is in a bad term with Soleimani. Since the start, PM Abadi believed that Soleimani was planning to remove him from power, supporting al-Maliki and promoting other choices to replace the actual Premier”, said the source.
The source concluded:”Iran controls various military organisations fighting within the Popular Mobilisation Units strongly present in the battlefield in Iraq and in Syria. Such an influence convinced al-Abadi to choose the path that leads to ” Uncle Sam ” instead of choosing the one of Welayat-el- faqih. This is why Abadi rejected, following an explicit American demand, to reject any Russia military assistance in the air, in Iraq, unlike the Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. The Iraqi Prime Ministre is aware of the possibility that the U.S would like to see 3 Iraqi cantons, one for the Kurds, one for the Sunni and another one for the Shia. The Americans are also supporting the Turkish presence in Iraq, to meet the say of the French Intelligence Service director who said: The Middle East will never be the same as before. What is becoming more clear now that ISIS is a toy used by players for their agenda and plans to reshuffle the map of the Middle East”.

Mexico City, Mexico (CNN) -- Fifteen suspects were killed Tuesday in a shootout with soldiers in the tourist town of Taxco, Mexico, the national defense secretary said in a news release.
A citizen's complaint about presumed illicit activities at a house led authorities to dispatch soldiers to a house in the town, which is located about 100 miles southwest of Mexico City, the release said.
Upon arriving at the house at 10:10 a.m. local time, they were greeted by gunfire and, acting in self-defense, responded with gunfire of their own, it said.
The battle continued for about 40 minutes, after which authorities determined that 15 "aggressors" were dead, and 16 long guns, six pistols, two home-made explosive devices and a vehicle were confiscated, it said.
The process of identifying the bodies was under way, it said.
The announcement of the killings came shortly before President Felipe Calderon, whose battle against drug trafficking has been a priority since he assumed office in December 2006, addressed the nation.
While not referring to the Taxco shooting, Calderon said, "As I said from the first, this is a fight that will take time and cost resources and human lives."
"Our future is in play ... we are going to continue ahead and we will win this fight," he said in a nationally televised address.

It's now a done deal for March 3rd at the Theater of Madison Square Garden where HBO will televise two light heavyweight title fights. In the main event, WBO champion Sergey Kovalev will face IBO champ Igor Mikhalkin, while WBA beltholder, Dmitry Bivol, takes on mandatory challenger Sullivan Barrera.
Barrera, had the choice facing either Kovalev or Bivol, to grab his WBA mandatory shot. In the end, he actually took less money to face Bivol.
"He was offered the choice of both fights, there was more money for the Kovalev fight but not as much as he liked,"stated Kathy Duva, the head of Main Events, which represents both Kovalev and Barrera (and is involved with Bivol). "So I think he felt that if he wins a title that he's got a stronger position."
It's a calculated risk that Barrera is taking and one that Duva understands.
She explained - "Now you're looking at a unification fight, so all of that remains to be seen. It's also a mater of how you win, there are a lot of things that are at play but in the case of a mandated fight like the one against Bivol, he's free and clear once he wins the fight, he's not obligated to fight a rematch. If he were going to fight Sergey in a voluntary situation that would be something we could bargain for.
"So I don't know if it's always just money and I recognize his position."
There were talks for Barrera to face Kovalev last month at the same New York venue. In that instance, Barrera was also unhappy with the money and instead fought Felix Valera on the undercard. Kovalev appeared in the HBO televised main event, and easily knocked out Vyacheslav Shabranskyy in two rounds to capture the vacant WBO title.

The next time you catch yourself crying on a street corner, just hope that Maria Sanchez is taking clandestine photos of you.
Last week, Dave Thomas, a San Bernardino man, was briefly jailed for failure to appear in court for traffic violations, leading to the impoundment of his dog on Feb. 13.
Upon release, Buzz Lightyear, a 2-year-old pit bull mix, was waiting for him at the San Bernardino City Animal Shelter. But Thomas couldn't pay the $400 to get his pet back, KABC reported.
Just as Thomas found out he couldn't get his dog back, Maria Sanchez, a photographer at the shelter who happened to be watching, captured the scene on camera.
Story continues after photo
"He was pouring water into his dog's water bowl, his dog sat there and licked up the water for about a minute, he sat down next to him and started weeping," Sanchez told KABC.
She posted the photo to Facebook, where strangers pledged to help the man.
Since Thomas hadn't left a phone number or a name at the facility, Sanchez needed to identify him before she could reach out.
She made phone calls and posted calls for help online. She drove around town posting flyers. She received a traffic ticket and had her car sideswiped.
All the while, donations poured in. On Monday night, KABC identified Thomas and put him in touch with Sanchez, who told him the cost of getting Buzz back was covered.
"God bless you darling," he said over the phone.
Hands On Few people would have placed ZTE as being in the flagship Android race this year in Europe, but its Axon 7 makes it a surprising and strong contender.
You'll know the script by now: buy a Chinese manufactured Android, get top-of-the-range features, and save £100-150 over a big brand HTC, Samsung or Sony flagship. Or even more in the case of the Axon 7, which will be £359 off Amazon. That's a considerable saving over the £449 that Huawei wants for its Leica-branded P9, although more than the £309 list price of the OnePlus Three.
I found the Axon offers a great all-metal design, a stunning QHD (quad high definition) display, and a surprisingly good camera. With almost no presence on the ground in the UK and a dim and dusty brand, the task now lies in persuading punters to take the gamble.
What follows is the result of a day with the Chinese variant of the Axon, so there's more depth than you get from the usual bloggy "hands on" (written after five minutes with the device) – but I'm not assessing performance or any software features beyond the camera and audio – two big attractions of the device.
The design sets itself apart with the top and bottom front-facing stereo speakers, reclaiming the distinctive design of the iconic HTC One models between 2013 and 2015. Here though, the speaker grilles have been compressed so the edge-to-edge display feels less like an island of glass within a portable music player, which was the effect of the Ones.
It's about a centimetre shorter than an iPhone 6 Plus, and half a centimetre narrower, but thanks to the thoughtful curved design, is vastly more comfortable to hold and use. I was surprised to find the 7 weighs in at 185g – it's tall but well balanced, and felt lighter.
The 5.5-inch display is superb: an AMOLED panel with 1440x2560 pixels, giving a pixel density of 538ppi, as high as anything on the market. On a typical 2016 London summer's day, with the sun reluctantly flashing for a minute or two, the display was legible and responded well to the ambient light conditions.
Inside the Axon 7 is the standard top line flagship for 2016: Snapdragon 820, 4GB of RAM and 64GB or 128GB of flash. It's a dual SIM configuration, with the second slot being able to take a microSD card. The non-removable 3140mAh battery should get you through a day – we'll see when we have our hands on the Western close-to-stock version. The rear-mounted fingerprint sensor was accurate, easy to find and extremely quick.
I promised to refrain from describing the phone's performance, as the Chinese-focused "MiFavor 4.0" skin is much heaver than the close-to-stock variant ZTE will sell in Europe and the USA. But even with the heavier skin it delivered lightning fast performance, with the camera starting almost instantly. You can expect some useful features to carry over from fat MiFavor to skinny MiFavor, such as a very low power mode.
On to the two main draws: audio and the camera.
Audio
The ZTE Axon 7 packs in dual front-facing speakers and two dedicated audio chips from AKM, the DAC (digital to analog converter) and the AK4961 32bit DSP. HTC makes much of its 24bit sound, but ZTE responds by arguing that its custom audio silicon leaves the Snapdragon 820 alone. The sticker feature here is support for Dolby Atmos 7:1 sound.
It needs much more testing to see if the device lives up to its audiophile ambitions, but the audio quality was excellent on headphones. The speakers are inhibited by the depth (or lack of it) of the audio chamber. As a result, it didn't quite have the resonance of an HTC One M8 or M9.
Your media will need to support tricks like Atmos to enjoy decent separation, I noted, as the speakers here are still pretty close together. Still, it's great to see audio a consideration in a world of almost identical phones. HTC can claim support for Apple Airplay, something ZTE can't do.

Camera app splash screen
The Axon 7's camera did a fine job, particularly indoors in dim light, and consistently showed a good colour balance, resisting the temptation to oversaturate photos. But it also exhibited the usual smartphone struggle with exposure. This struggle is evident in the bike photos. (The second is a detail of a capture without HDR.) You can, in the apps's manual mode, set the exposure point.
Slow motion video and time lapse are all handled well. Panorama shots need some work, which I'll expect they'll get in an update.
Conclusion
Based on this Chinese-oriented sample, there's little to dislike about the ZTE Axon 7, and the huge potential money saving over big brand flagships (around £200) pushes ZTE into the leader pack. ®
Mr Heins said that “In five years I don't think there'll be a reason to have a tablet anymore. Maybe a big screen in your workspace, but not a tablet as such. Tablets themselves are not a good business model.”
Tablets have powered Apple and increasingly Samsung to huge profits, so Mr Heins' suggestions will be met with incredulity in some quarters. But diminishing profit margins on iPads could also indicate that the market will become less attractive over time.
The suggestion that there is a limited future for tablet computers could also indicate that Mr Heins plans to shelve a follow-up to the smartphone maker's ill-fated PlayBook device.
The PlayBook, introduced in 2011, was panned by critics for debuting without built-in e-mail, delivering the tablet a near-fatal blow. BlackBerry took a $485 million charge later that year to write down unsold inventory after shipping as few as 150,000 PlayBooks in the third quarter of 2012.
Mr Heins said in January that he would only consider a PlayBook successor if it can be profitable, and reiterated yesterday that a BlackBerry tablet has to offer a unique proposition in a crowded market.
“In five years, I see BlackBerry to be the absolute leader in mobile computing - that's what we're aiming for,” Heins said, empahsising the importance of phones over tablets. “I want to gain as much market share as I can, but not by being a copycat.”
In a separate interview with Bloomberg Television yesterday, Heins said he was optimistic about prospects for BlackBerry's new Q10 phone, which sports a physical keyboard and debuted in Selfridges over the weekend in the UK.
“We have very, very good first signs already after the launch in the UK,” Heins said. “This is going into the installed base of more than 70 million BlackBerry users, so we have quite some expectations. We expect several tens of million of units.”
BlackBerry stock has increased 32 percent this year on speculation that the BlackBerry 10 lineup can help fuel a comeback.
The company is counting on a wave of upgrade buying from BlackBerry users who prefer a physical keyboard to drive Q10 sales and help revive revenue growth. While the touch-screen Z10 sold a million units in its first quarter that ended March 2, in line with analyst estimates, the company's stock has experienced volatility in recent weeks following reports of lackluster demand for the Z10.
Contrary to earlier reports, data from BlackBerry and one of its US carrier partners Verizon Wireless show that Z10 returns are “completely in line” with the industry and “better than previous BlackBerry launches were, so the quality speaks for itself,” Heins said.
Heins also said he is still exploring the potential licensing of the BlackBerry 10 operating system to other companies. A successful introduction of the new phones will “create a certain attraction toward BlackBerry 10, and then whatever comes up, we will entertain any valuable discussion for the company,” Heins said yesterday. “We are still observing and watching that space, and that's what we will continue to do.”
John "Goldfinger" Palmer, one of Britain's most notorious criminals, suffered six gunshot wounds when he was killed in his garden , it has emerged.
The gangland figure, who was linked to the Brinks-Mat robbery, was reportedly shot in the back and both arms and suffering fatal chest wounds.
But despite suffering six wounds, only five bullets have been recovered, according to The Times, as police continue to search the garden of his home in South Weald, near Brentwood, Essex.
The development will heap further pressure on police and paramedics to explain why the 64-year-old was reported to have died of natural causes when his body was found on June 24.
Essex Police did not launch a murder inquiry until six days after his death, when a routine post mortem examination found he had been shot in the chest.
John ‘Goldfinger' Palmer, with his former wife Marnie in 1987, was said to have had a £300 million fortune
Palmer's brother Malcolm, 68, said last week that it was "ridiculous" neither police nor paramedicas had not spotted he had been murdered.
Palmer had recently had gall bladder surgery and it is believed his killer might have used the operation injuries to disguise the bullet wound.
Police sources have since said the murder bore all the hallmarks of a professional hit and detectives are now liaising with the Flying Squad to see if Palmer may have played a role in the dramatic raid on a Hatton Garden safe deposit vault over the Easter weekend.
The weapon is thought to be a handgun, and it is believed a silencer was used.
Palmer, who was tried for melting down gold bars stolen in the £26million Brinks-Mat theft of bullion and jewellery from a warehouse at Heathrow Airport, is the eighth person with close links to the 1983 robbery to be shot dead.
He was once described as Britain's richest criminal with a fortune of £300million, and was jailed at the Old Bailey in 2001 over his involvement in a timeshare swindle, which cost thousands of people their life savings.
But he was best known for his connection to the Brink's-MAT heist, for which he was tried in 1987. He was said to have melted down bullion from the robbery in his back garden, but denied knowing the bullion was stolen and was acquitted.
At the time of his death he was facing charges of money laundering and possession of firearms in Tenerife.
It has been claimed that he may also have had links to organised crime in Russia, according to newspaper reports in the 1990s.
Spanish security services believed that his head bodyguard was once a colonel in the KGB.
HALIFAX – Nova Scotia's Liberal government tabled legislation Tuesday that would impose a new four-year contract for the province's 9,300 teachers and result in an end to their union's legal strike position.
The contract was included as part of the Teachers Professional Agreement and Classroom Improvement Act, which once passed, would end the 16-month long contract dispute.
The bill was introduced as a large group of teachers protested the move in the chilly night air outside the legislature.
Premier Stephen McNeil told reporters it was simply time for the government to act after the union membership rejected three tentative agreements recommended by the union's executive.
“I was hoping that the most recent one (contract) would have been accepted,” said McNeil. “Work-to-rule is having an impact on schools across this province and this is to try to put some normalcy back in the classrooms.”
The new contract contains a three per cent salary increase and incorporates much of the elements contained in the first two tentative agreements rejected by members of the Nova Scotia Teachers Union. A third tentative deal was rejected last week by a vote of 78.5 per cent, prompting the government to push ahead with a legislated settlement.
The salary package includes zero per cent for the first two years, followed by increases of one per cent in the third year and 1.5 per cent in the fourth, with a 0.5 per cent increase on the last day of the agreement.
McNeil said it was the same wage pattern teacher's rejected in the first deal, although by a smaller margin than in subsequent votes, and that's why it was adopted by the government. He said the government wasn't attempting to punish teachers for voting no to the latest deal.
“Not at all. We had to have a contract and the one that the majority of them voted for was the first one, it's as simple as it gets,” McNeil said.
The government said the province would save $18 million in contract costs over the most recently rejected deal.
Outside the legislature, teachers were quick to express their disappointment with an imposed settlement they say tramples their right to collective bargaining and doesn't address conditions in the classroom.
“I leave here tonight with nothing that is going to help me in the classroom,” said Terry Williams, a Grade 6 teacher at a school in suburban Halifax.
Williams, who also coaches softball and soccer, said he would now have to consider whether it was worth his time to continue volunteering outside of classroom duties.
“As much as I love it, as much as I want to do it for the kids, do I want to go above and beyond after this process of just feeling neglected and not appreciated,” he said.
The bill establishes a council to improve classroom conditions and a commitment of $20 million over two years to address that issue.
There will also be a three-person commission on inclusive education that will be launched 30 days after the bill is passed. The commission is expected to submit an interim report by June 30, which will leave enough time for recommendations to be implemented for the upcoming school year.
Union president Liette Doucet said her membership would be angered by the imposition of a deal that actually loses the minor gains contained in the most recently rejected deal. Two paid leave days were also among provisions that didn't make it into the new contract.
“They were already upset about the fact that they were not getting a cost of living increase and so now that has been made worse,” Doucet said.
Under the bill, teachers would be prevented from withdrawing some services while at school, a move related to such things as staff meetings and professional development. Participation in voluntary aspects such as coaching sports teams would be left to an individual teacher's discretion.
There is also a commitment to examine class sizes at the junior and senior high levels and to look at the creation of a program to help teachers access their long-service awards prior to retirement, although the retirement bonuses would remain frozen.
Progressive Conservative Leader Jamie Baillie said his party would not support a government bill he described as “odious.”
“Adding more committees and more bureaucracy — the time is past for that. That's why teachers don't trust them and parents don't trust them to actually make change.”
NDP Leader Gary Burrill panned the legislation calling it the “Slap in the Face Act.”
“What there ought to have been from the beginning was competent negotiations,” he said.
It's expected it will take a week or more to pass the bill into law.
The union is demanding its members be allowed to speak when the opportunity comes to propose amendments.
Lessons from my first year of live coding on Twitch
Suz Hinton Blocked Unblock Follow Jul 7, 2017
I gave streaming a go for the first time last July. Instead of gaming, which the majority of streamers on Twitch do, I wanted to stream the open source work I do in my personal time. I work on NodeJS hardware libraries a fair bit (most of them my own). Given that I was already in a niche on Twitch, why not be in an even smaller niche, like JavaScript powered hardware ;) I signed up for my own channel, and have been streaming regularly since.
Of course I'm not the first to do this. Handmade Hero was one of the first programmers I watched code online, quickly followed by the developers at Vlambeer who developed Nuclear Throne live on Twitch. I was fascinated by Vlambeer especially.
What tipped me over the edge of wishing I could do it to actually doing it is credited to Nolan Lawson, a friend of mine. I watched him streaming his open source work one weekend, and it was awesome. He explained everything he was doing along the way. Everything. Replying to issues on GitHub, triaging bugs, debugging code in branches, you name it. I found it fascinating, as Nolan maintains open source libraries that get a lot of use and activity. His open source life is very different to mine.
You can even see this comment I left under his video:
I gave it a go myself a week or so later, after setting up my Twitch channel and bumbling my way through using OBS. I believe I worked on Avrgirl-Arduino, which I still frequently work on while streaming. It was a rough first stream. I was very nervous, and I had stayed up late rehearsing everything I was going to do the night before.
The tiny number of viewers I got that Saturday were really encouraging though, so I kept at it. These days I have more than a thousand followers, and a lovely subset of them are regular visitors who I call “the noopkat fam”.
We have a lot of fun, and I like to call the live coding parts “massively multiplayer online pair programming”. I am truly touched by the kindness and wit of everyone joining me each weekend. One of the funniest moments I have had was when one of the fam pointed out that my Arduino board was not working with my software because the microchip was missing from the board:
I have logged off a stream many a time, only to find in my inbox that someone has sent a pull request for some work that I had mentioned I didn't have the time to start on. I can honestly say that my open source work has been changed for the better, thanks to the generosity and encouragement of my Twitch community.
I have so much more to say about the benefits that streaming on Twitch has brought me, but that's for another blog post probably. Instead, I want to share the lessons I have learned for anyone else who would like to try live coding in this way for themselves. Recently I've been asked by a few developers how they can get started, so I'm publishing the same advice I have given them!
Firstly, I'm linking you to a guide called “Streaming and Finding Success on Twitch” which helped me a lot. It's focused towards Twitch and gaming streams specifically, but there are still relevant sections and great advice in there. I'd recommend reading this first before considering any other details about starting your channel (like equipment or software choices).
My own advice is below, which I have acquired from my own mistakes and the sage wisdom of fellow streamers (you know who you are!).
Software
There's a lot of free streaming software out there to stream with. I use Open Broadcaster Software (OBS). It's available on most platforms. I found it really intuitive to get up and going, but others sometimes take a while to learn how it works. Your mileage may vary! Here is a screen-grab of what my OBS ‘desktop scene' setup looks like as of today (click for larger image):
You essentially switch between ‘scenes' while streaming. A scene is a collection of ‘sources', layered and composited with each other. A source can be things like a camera, microphone, your desktop, a webpage, live text, images, the list goes on. OBS is very powerful.
This desktop scene above is where I do all of my live coding, and I mostly live here for the duration of the stream. I use iTerm and vim, and also have a browser window handy to switch to in order to look up documentation and triage things on GitHub, etc.
The bottom black rectangle is my webcam, so folks can see me work and have a more personal connection.
I have a handful of ‘labels' for my scenes, many of which are to do with the stats and info in the top banner. The banner just adds personality, and is a nice persistent source of info while streaming. It's an image I made in GIMP, and you import it as a source in your scene. Some labels are live stats that pull from text files (such as most recent follower). Another label is a custom one I made which shows the live temperature and humidity of the room I stream from.
I have also ‘alerts' set up in my scenes, which show cute banners over the top of my stream whenever someone follows or donates money. I use the web service Stream Labs to do this, importing it as a browser webpage source into the scene. Stream Labs also creates my recent followers live text file to show in my banner.
I also have a standby screen that I use when I'm about to be live:
I additionally need a scene for when I'm entering secret tokens or API keys. It shows me on the webcam but hides my desktop with an entertaining webpage, so I can work in privacy:
As you can see, I don't take stuff too seriously when streaming, but I like to have a good setup for my viewers to get the most out of my stream.
But now for an actual secret: I use OBS to crop out the bottom and right edges of my screen, while keeping the same video size ratio as what Twitch expects. That leaves me with space to watch my events (follows, etc) on the bottom, and look at and respond to my channel chat box on the right. Twitch allows you to ‘pop out' the chatbox in a new window which is really helpful.
This is what my full desktop really looks like:
I started doing this a few months ago and haven't looked back. I'm not even sure my viewers realise this is how my setup works. I think they take for granted that I can see everything, even though I cannot see what is actually being streamed live when I'm busy programming!
You might be wondering why I only use one monitor. It's because two monitors was just too much to manage on top of everything else I was doing while streaming. I figured this out quickly and have stuck with one screen since.
Hardware
I used cheaper stuff to start out, and slowly bought nicer stuff as I realised that streaming was going to be something I stuck with. Use whatever you have when getting started, even if it's your laptop's built-in microphone and camera.
Nowadays I use a Logitech Pro C920 webcam, and a Blue Yeti microphone on a microphone arm with a mic shock. Totally worth the money in the end if you have it to spend. It made a difference to the quality of my streams.
I use a large monitor (27"), because as I mentioned earlier using two monitors just didn't work for me. I was missing things in the chat because I was not looking over to the second laptop screen enough, etc etc. Your milage may vary here, but having everything on one screen was key for me to pay attention to everything happening.
That's pretty much it on the hardware side; I don't have a very complicated setup.
If you were interested, my desk looks pretty normal except for the obnoxious looming microphone:
Tips
This last section has some general tips I've picked up, that have made my stream better and more enjoyable overall.
Panels
Spend some time on creating great panels. Panels are the little content boxes on the bottom of everyone's channel page. I see them as the new MySpace profile boxes (lol but really). Panel ideas could be things like chat rules, information about when you stream, what computer and equipment you use, your favourite cat breed; anything that creates a personal touch. Look at other channels (especially popular ones) for ideas!
An example of one of my panels:
Chat
Chat is really important. You're going to get the same questions over and over as people join your stream halfway through, so having chat ‘macros' can really help. “What are you working on?” is the most common question asked while I'm coding. I have chat shortcut ‘commands' for that, which I made with Nightbot. It will put an explanation of something I have entered in ahead of time, by typing a small one word command like !whatamidoing
When folks ask questions or leave nice comments, talk back to them! Say thanks, say their Twitch handle, and they'll really appreciate the attention and acknowledgement. This is SUPER hard to stay on top of when you first start streaming, but multitasking will come easier as you do more. Try to take a few seconds every couple of minutes to look at the chat for new messages.
When programming, explain what you're doing. Talk a lot. Make jokes. Even when I'm stuck, I'll say, “oh, crap, I forget how to use this method lemme Google it hahaha” and folks are always nice and sometimes they'll even read along with you and help you out. It's fun and engaging, and keeps folks watching.
I lose interest quickly when I'm watching programming streams where the streamer is sitting in silence typing code, ignoring the chat and their new follower alerts.
It's highly likely that 99% of folks who find their way to your channel will be friendly and curious. I get the occasional troll, but the moderation tools offered by Twitch and Nightbot really help to discourage this.
Prep time
Automate your setup as much as possible. My terminal is iTerm, and it lets you save window arrangements and font sizes so you can restore back to them later. I have one window arrangement for streaming and one for non streaming. It's a massive time saver. I hit one command and everything is the perfect size and in the right position, ready to go.
There are other apps out there that automate all of your app window placements, have a look to see if any of them would also help.
Make your font size really large in your terminal and code editor so everyone can see.
Regularity
Be regular with your schedule. I only stream once a week, but always at the same time. Let folks know if you're not able to stream during an expected time you normally do. This has netted me a regular audience. Some folks love routine and it's exactly like catching up with a friend. You're in a social circle with your community, so treat it that way.
I want to stream more often, but I know I can't commit to more than once a week because of travel. I am trying to come up with a way to stream in high quality when on the road, or perhaps just have casual chats and save programming for my regular Sunday stream. I'm still trying to figure this out!
Awkwardness
It's going to feel weird when you get started. You're going to feel nervous about folks watching you code. That's normal! I felt that really strongly at the beginning, even though I have public speaking experience. I felt like there was nowhere for me to hide, and it scared me. I thought, “everyone is going to think my code is bad, and that I'm a bad developer”. This is a thought pattern that has plagued me my entire career though, it's nothing new. I knew that with this, I couldn't quietly refactor code before pushing to GitHub, which is generally much safer for my reputation as a developer.
I learned a lot about my programming style by live coding on Twitch. I learned that I'm definitely the “make it work, then make it readable, then make it fast” type. I don't rehearse the night before anymore (I gave that up after 3 or 4 streams right at the beginning), so I write pretty rough code on Twitch and have to be okay with that. I write my best code when alone with my thoughts and not watching a chat box + talking aloud, and that's okay. I forget method signatures that I've used a thousand times, and make ‘silly' mistakes in almost every single stream. For most, it's not a productive environment for being at your best.
My Twitch community never judges me for this, and they help me out a lot. They understand I'm multitasking, and are really great about pragmatic advice and suggestions. Sometimes they bail me out, and other times I have to explain to them why their suggestion won't work. It's really just like regular pair programming!
I think the ‘warts and all' approach to this medium is a strength, not a weakness. It makes you more relatable, and it's important to show that there's no such thing as the perfect programmer, or the perfect code. It's probably quite refreshing for new coders to see, and humbling for myself as a more experienced coder.
Conclusion
If you've been wanting to get into live coding on Twitch, I encourage you to give it a try! I hope this post helped you if you have been wondering where to start.
If you'd like to join me on Sundays, you can follow my channel on Twitch :)
On my last note, I'd like to personally thank Mattias Johansson for his wisdom and encouragement early on in my streaming journey. He was incredibly generous, and his FunFunFunction YouTube channel is a continuous source of inspiration.
Update: a bunch of folks has been asking about my keyboard and other parts of my workstation. Here is the complete list of what I use. Thanks for the interest!
Nevada issues Google first license for self-driving car
AP Photo/Sandra Chereb
CARSON CITY — Nevadans will soon see driverless cars being tested on streets and highways.
Google received the first license Monday from the state Department of Motor Vehicles to test the autonomous vehicles. It is believed to be the first such license issued in the country.
The 2011 Legislature passed the first law in the nation to permit testing of driverless cars. But state regulations require a person behind the wheel and one in the passenger's seat during tests.
“It's still a work in progress,” said Tom Jacobs, a DMV spokesman. “The system regulates the brakes, accelerator and steering.”
Google has equipped a test fleet of at least eight vehicles — six Toyota Priuses, an Audi TT and a Lexus RX450h.
License plates issued for driverless cars will have a red background and feature an infinity symbol on the left side.
“I feel using the infinity symbol was the best way to represent the 'car of the future,'” DMV Director Bruce Breslow said.
DMV officials have been in the vehicles during demonstrations on the Las Vegas Strip and in Carson City. There have been other demonstrations of the technology on the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco and around Lake Tahoe.
The system permits a human driver to take control by stepping on the brake or turning the wheel.
Google says it hopes to market the technology to auto manufacturers. It combines artificial intelligence software, a global positioning system and an array of sensors to navigate its way through traffic.
The DMV says other companies have indicated their desire to test and develop autonomous technology. “Google has a lot of competition,” Jacobs said.
Editor's note: Each day this week Florida State reporter David M. Hale and Auburn reporter Greg Ostendorf will preview a position battle in Monday's VIZIO BCS National Championship. Today's matchup is between Auburn's offensive line and Florida State's defensive line.
Auburn's offensive line: We've broken down all of the matchups this week, but as Auburn center Reese Dismukes put so eloquently Thursday, “You can have all the pretty boys you want, but whoever wins the line of scrimmage all day is usually going to be who wins the football game.” If that's the case, the Tigers are in good shape. They feature one of the most dominant offensive lines in the country. It's the reason they're in Pasadena, Calif.
FSU nose tackle Timmy Jernigan is a force inside, and how well the Tigers do against him could determine how well they run the ball. Melina Vastola/USA TODAY Sports
Dismukes, a three-year starter, is the anchor of the group. He was a finalist for the Rimington Trophy, awarded to the top center in college football, and although it's not an official stat, he leads the team in knockdowns. The matchup between him and Florida State nose tackle Timmy Jernigan won't just be a battle in the trenches -- it will be a war.
From a pure talent standpoint, sophomore left tackle Greg Robinson has emerged as the best player on this Auburn offensive line. He started last year but was still relatively unknown heading into this season. He's quickly become a star in the SEC, and he continues to improve his draft stock with every game.
Junior Chad Slade doesn't get the notoriety, but he's been as solid as it gets for the Tigers. He moved from right tackle to right guard and hasn't missed a beat. The other two spots are taken by a pair of redshirt freshmen, Alex Kozan and Avery Young. Kozan was named to the freshman All-SEC team for his play at left guard.
If Auburn wants to knock off No. 1 Florida State, this is the matchup it has to win. The Tigers have rushed for an average of 402 yards over the past four games, and it's in no small part due to the play of the offensive line.
Florida State's defensive line: This is a much different defensive front than what the Seminoles ran in three years under Mark Stoops. When Jeremy Pruitt took over at defensive coordinator this season, he had four new starters on the line and completely revamped the scheme. It's been something of a work in progress all season, but the Seminoles believe the unit is playing its best football now.
Jernigan is a beast in the middle of the line, and he'll be a huge challenge for an Auburn team that wants to play physical and run between the tackles. Seminoles opponents are averaging just 3.1 yards per rush between the tackles and fewer than 9 percent of runs up the middle go for 10 yards or more. Jernigan also leads FSU's defensive linemen in sacks (4.5) and tackles for loss (10.5).
Eddie Goldman and Mario Edwards Jr. add plenty of size to the mix on the D-line, too, while Christian Jones and FSU's safeties will be counted on to seal the edge, which is where the defense is far more vulnerable. Across the board, Auburn's O-line figures to be as big a physical challenge as Florida State has faced all season, and with the tempo that the Tigers run, it could be tough for FSU to substitute as often as it would like.
There's ample talent on the line for Florida State, but this figures to be as tough a matchup as the unit has faced.
Ostendorf: Edge Auburn
Hale: Slight edge for Auburn

I've been depressed and not writing. So, it was a little ironic when I did an interview with Danny Whittaker of My Own Worst Enemy (MOWE) podcast in mid-December. Danny draws on the expertise of clinical psychologists, physicians, psychiatrists and researchers in his new podcast, and he has already taken on a variety of challenging and interesting topics that I think will interest PT readers such as:
Psychosis, Susceptibility and Early Intervention
Feeling Good With
: The Serious Issue of a Ridiculed Illness
Mental and Raising Confident Kids
Schizophrenia: A Journey Inside the Shattered Mind
Disorder: The Illness of Missed Opportunities
The of Fear: Disorder and Agoraphobia,
and most recently
Why Makes You Depressed (and Makes You Procrastinate)
We had a good chat. However, the irony of discussing depression and procrastination at a time when I was quite depressed wasn't lost on me. Perhaps it was the perfect time to discuss the topic.
Today, when Danny emailed from "across the pond" as they say to tell me that the podcast was up and that it had already attracted a lot of interest in his local support group, we got into a brief exchange where he recommended a "must read" book.
He offered the suggested read when I told him that I haven't been writing. He assumed I was blocked, I guess, but that wasn't the case. I hadn't stopped writing because I couldn't write, I just chose to give myself some time off while I dealt with the death of my father. The depression was to be expected, and some self-compassion was necessary.
In any case, Danny made a perfect suggestion, I think, as I've read the book before, but I sure needed to think through it again. And, to his credit, both his podcast and listening to the book again as an Audible "read" while driving to the university has prompted me to write. Win-Win.
Ok, I said this would be a brief post, so the book is by Steven Pressfield the renowned author. It's not social science, and he even discusses how writing a nonfiction "advice-type book" like this initially fueled his resistance to write at all. Resistance is his focus, and it's really a good read. For those of us who procrastinate and for whom procrastination undermines (read: All of us!), you will cringe as you read and you will learn important things.
I don't agree with everything Pressfield has to say, but that doesn't matter. I even recommend you fuel your own procrastination today by becoming acquainted with Danny's My Own Worst Enemy podcast and Pressfield's wonderful book The War of Art. It might be one of the few times that procrastination will pay off.
I recently finished reading Moneyball. Yeah, I'm 10 years late to the party. For those who haven't read it, here's a brief synopsis: Professional baseball has not properly valued players' skills, and Billy Beane and the Oakland Athletics took advantage of these inefficiencies to create one of the most successful regular season teams in baseball history. Michael Lewis did a fantastic job with the book, telling the entertaining story of what went on during those years and the pushback they got from the baseball establishment.
Lewis' book was released in 2003, and baseball has undergone a pretty significant transformation in the decade since. Everyone embraces "sabermetrics" now. Blogs like FireJoeMorgan.com have helped bring to light the idiocy of the old way of thinking. The book, along with Billy Beane and the Athletics, helped transform the way we consume baseball.
So what does this have to do with Oregon football? As I watched the National Signing Day coverage unfold last Wednesday, I kept thinking about Moneyball. I kept thinking about inefficiencies in the system.
For a lot of years, you couldn't discuss Oregon recruiting without talking about how recruiting star rankings don't mean anything. Max Unger! Patrick Chung! Two-star players we turn into All-Americans! Who cares if we're only top 25 in recruiting!
Now, the narrative has changed. Oregon can pull in only a top 20 class? But our facilities! Our success! Why aren't we top 10 in recruiting?!
When I first started writing for this blog, I was one of the main proponents for improvement in Oregon's recruiting. Recruiting is very, very important. It's incredibly difficult to succeed in college football when you're bringing in two- and three-star players. In the early days of the college football blogdom, while sites like Sports Illustrated were cataloging all the star-ranking disasters, writers like Matt Hinton were writing about how the star rankings win out. He's been writing this piece for many years. Here's this year's iteration. Long story short, teams that bring in five-star players are more likely to win football games.
This shouldn't be all that surprising. Talent in football is important. The typical scouting system does a pretty solid job ranking talent in high school football players. The narrative goes: The more talent you have, the better chances you have of winning football games.
That's a nice narrative, but it's incomplete. This narrative has not progressed in years. Well, look at that, recruiting stars do a pretty decent job correlating to success on the field! That was something that needed to be communicated five years ago. It's not that useful anymore.
And that brings me back to Moneyball. One of the main points of Moneyball was the mitigation of risk. In this specific case, led by Billy Beane, Oakland pretty much refused to draft high school players. Their risk was too great for the reward. Recruiting is very similar to this process. And what's been at a premium for as long as college football has existed? Raw physical talent.
In recruiting, every coach in the country is trying to bring in the most physically talented players possible, under the assumption that will bring them the greatest chance of winning football games. This isn't just the case in college football. Look at every single sport in existence. The NFL, NBA, and MLB value physical specimens over actual production (something that Moneyball covered extensively). A player like Jake Locker (OREGON BIAS ALERT) can be taken in the top 10 of the NFL draft while showing pretty much nothing in college. While he's not a disaster at the pro level, it's incredibly doubtful that he ever lives up to his draft position. Seriously, Titans, I watched him for four years; I could have told you this. But his talent was too much to pass up.
So as we watch National Signing Day coverage, just like every other draft, it's all about that raw physical talent. It's not that surprising that that's what people value. First, it's fairly easy to judge. The players who are 6'4", 260 pounds, and run a 4.4 40-yard dash have a pretty good chance of being very successful. Second, it's been a pretty decent way of telling who will and will not be successful. Teams with a ton of talent typically do very well. Teams with less talent don't do as well!
This is a very, very easy narrative. It's mostly backed up by stats. But it's simplistic. And as Oregon fans, it's time we moved past that.
As I mentioned before, recruiting is about minimizing risk. Talent is a great way to minimize risk. If you're going to give yourself a chance at success, the simplest way to do that is amassed the most amount of talent possible. As noted in Hinton's latest article, five-star teams beat four-star teams 66% of the time. As he's noted in the past, roughly 25% of five-star athletes become All-Americans.
It's very easy to conclude that talent does matter. But just as readily obvious is that it is not all that matters. When presented with more information and examples of outliers, you shouldn't ignore those outliers. You should ask why those outliers are happening. Unfortunately, this isn't the case.
In his review of Florida State and Auburn's run at national titles, SBNation Recruiting's Bud Elliot places a large emphasis on traditional recruiting success. He calls recruiting a "numbers game." But he says that it's a numbers game that "one favoring the team that hoards stars." Bud is right that it's a number game. But it's a numbers game that attempts to minimize risk and maximize the potential for success. Bud, and most others that cover recruiting, focus only on one area to minimize that risk. And when National Signing Day rolls around, that is the only aspect of recruiting that is covered to any serious extent. We focus only on raw physical talent despite its obvious limitations.
If we want to talk about minimizing risk, we must move beyond the narrative that's been repeated for as long as we've known recruiting. It's not simply how much talent we can amass, but how can we increase the likelihood that a three-star athlete will succeed? How can we increase the chances of success for a four- or five-star athlete?
The percentages used by traditional metrics look only at star ratings. How many other metrics are there? How many metrics do you think the Oregon coaching staff is using? As a group, they personally evaluated 1,000 prospective student athletes this year. They're obviously not looking at just raw physical talent.
As Rob Moseley noted in his behind-the-scenes Signing Day article:
One member of the media asks Helfrich about Oregon's character evaluations, which are so extensive they're becoming the stuff of legend in recruiting circles. Helfrich said the staff evaluates recruits on eight criteria not related to football - social-media presence and academics are among factors they consider - and they're not afraid to eliminate an athletically talented prospect because of character concerns.
According to 247Sports, Oregon gave out only 111 offers to prospective student athletes during the 2014 recruiting cycle, far less than any comparable school. By contrast, Alabama gave out 184 offers and USC gave out 148. This tells me that Oregon believes there are inefficiencies in the traditional recruiting system. They are not looking just at five groups of players and their chances of success. With the right data, you can easily control for a number of different character traits combined with physical skill, maximizing the chances of success where traditional metrics give an incomplete picture.
As Oregon has become more successful on the field, many Oregon fans are looking for more traditional success in recruiting. In my opinion, there is no reason to expect that. At Oregon, we've built our program on innovation. For years, we've brought in undervalued players and turned them into stars. Under Chip Kelly, we used scheme and speed to confound the conference. Some fans are asking where the next great innovation lies. It's in recruiting. It's in evaluating players and finding those players that give the Ducks the best chance to be successful long-term. If this correlates to the traditional star rankings, so be it. If not, who cares?
As an Oregon fan, I want my team to succeed on the field. I don't need validation from an outdated system to prove our place among the college football elite. Our record over the last five years does that by itself.
Now, this isn't the easiest thing. As noted above, evaluating high school players based on their physical talent is comparatively easy. Amassing physical talent has been and will be the easiest path to success for many teams. As sports fans, we want to win everything, even something as ultimately meaningless as the recruiting rankings wars.
Unfortunately, I feel that Oregon will perpetually be lagging behind in the traditional recruiting wars and in the battle for physical talent. Based on geography alone, Oregon will never consistently compete with the traditional recruiting powers. But that doesn't mean that Oregon won't be more successful on the field.
Oregon will continue to do what they do best: innovate. They will work to find what others are not valuing and exploit that to the highest degree. They have to. Or else they won't stay near the elite in college football.
But don't despair, Oregon fans. If Moneyball taught us anything, it's that you don't need to follow the pack to be elite. If anything, if you have built-in disadvantages, that's exactly what you shouldn't do.
9 Unexpectedly Awesome Options We'll Never See Again
History has taught us that people will put just about anything inside their cars, be it to go more quickly through the scenery or perhaps make the journey more enjoyable. The options a vehicle is offered with can sometimes define it, but these strange ideas for optional extras never really caught on, which is sort of a shame.
Because who doesn't want a car with a fold-up scooter in its trunk?
1991 Ferrari F40: This is the one with leather
Connolly Leather in a Ferrari F40? That's not strange, unless you remember that the F40 is Ferrari's track day, open road supercar, built when weight was saved everywhere—even the paint was applied as sparsely as possible. But if you ask the right people nicely enough, as this car shows, one customer was able to specify Connolly leather, creating the most luxurious F40 in the process.

1969 Jensen Interceptor: Typing down the road
Before cell phones, Bluetooth, conference calling, voice dictation, and other incredible features packed into today's smartphones, it's amazing to consider how ridiculous replicating it all in analogue form would look. You'd need a secretary, typewriter, small desk…do you think she'd take notes during a track day? This is British Pathé footage of a wild setup from the late '60s, where a businessman-on-the-go could presumably buy this ultimate productivity tool. Epic.
1978 Cadillac Techniques d'Avant Garde Function Car by Sbarro: Your Office
Almost 10 years later, the Jensen was reimagined, in a sense, as the ultimate mobile office. With a second rear axle and room for more than just a secretary, it was commissioned by Techniques d'Avant Garde, otherwise known as TAG, now more famously TAG-Heuer. The mobile office could seat a few people, was decked out with television and (surely) a place to keep a few bottles of bubbly chilled…just in case the team closes the big account, of course…
1961 Goodyear concept tires: Let there be light
Surely, the ultimate gee-whiz effect in 1961 would have been light-up tires. These illuminated tires were developed by the Goodyear Tire Company, made from a single piece of synthetic rubber, and were lit by bulbs that had been mounted inside the wheel rim and intended to be produced in a variety of colors.
1957 Cadillac Eldorado Brougham: Shot glasses in Cadillac
In the late-'50s, America was a place so vastly different as to allow—or at least not to restrict—the now-rare magnetic mini bar option on high-end Cadillacs.
1988 Giocattolo Group B: Drinking in a mid-engined supercar
You're looking at an Alfa Romeo Sprint that's been turned into a mid-engined car, thanks to the fitment of a warmed-up Holden V8 behind the front seats. The entire story on the car is fascinating, but the package was less than 2,400 lbs. and had more than 300 horsepower, giving it the cojones to keep up with the Porsche 911 Turbo and Lamborghini Countach LP500S. Did you catch the “Holden V8” part? Yeah, this beast is Australian.
The Group B is a very good idea, indeed, but even better knows its toolkit includes a bottle of rum. After all, if something this exotic breaks down, the builders know you're going to call a tow truck.
1980 Mercedes-Benz 280TE by Zender: Home stereo away from home
I can't say for certain if cars like this Zender-tuned Mercedes-Benz are the reason even econoboxes now sport impressive stereos, but in the early '80s, having a serious stereo in a car was just—pardon the pun—unheard of. Here, the integration is less than stealthy and certainly not tasteful, but a part of me wishes car stereos were more like this and less like the touchscreen slabs they've become.

1986 Porsche 911 Turbo Mirage by Gemballa: TV on the Autobahn
Tuning legend Uwe Gemballa would sell you a 911 capable of nearly 200 mph—thanks to serious body modifications and an engine from Alois Ruf—easily making it the most extreme tuner cars of the mid-‘80s. That its roof is chopped and it sports lots of horsepower isn't too surprising, but the door-mounted rearview cameras are. Inside, a small TV screen was placed in the centre of the dashboard, presumably so that its driver could watch Kraftwerk music videos while on the way to work.

MILWAUKEE — With help from his teammates putting 10 early runs on the board, Kyle Lohse completed a rare feat Friday night in Milwaukee's 10-4 rout of the Minnesota Twins at Miller Park.
Lohse became just the 14th pitcher in baseball history with a win over all 30 current major-league teams by checking the Twins off the list.
"I knew I had one team that I hadn't beat," Lohse said. "I was real appreciative of our team giving me a lead that early, that kind of size, that you go out and just try to collect outs."
It would be an understatement to say 2015 has been a struggle for Lohse, as he entered with a 6.30 ERA over 15 starts. However, the veteran right-hander received quite a bit of run support in the early innings Friday.
The Brewers chased Twins starter Trevor May after just 1/3 of an inning en route to scoring six runs on six hits in the first inning. Gerardo Parra led off with a solo home run to tie the game at 1-all, while Jonathan Lucroy, Ryan Braun and Adam Lind all got hits off May.
May also committed a throwing error on a potential double-play ball, opening the floodgates for Milwaukee to add two runs on a Jean Segura single and another on a safety squeeze involving Lohse.
The Brewers opened up a 10-1 lead in the second, as Aramis Ramirez and Scooter Gennett each hit home runs off Twins rookie reliever Alex Meyer.
All Lohse had to do to complete his historic feat was last five innings without completely imploding. He battled a high pitch count early and surrendered two home runs but lasted six innings and left with a 10-4 lead.
"He got through his six innings," Brewers manager Craig Counsell said. "There have been times he's pitched better but got worse results. He got through it. But when you're pitching with a lead like that, the game is a little different. You have a lead like that, it's just get outs and he did his job there."
Coincidentally, the only team Lohse hadn't beaten prior to Friday was Minnesota. The 36-year-old broke into the big leagues in 2001 with the Twins and pitched nearly six seasons in Minnesota before he was traded to Cincinnati at the trade deadline in 2006.
Lohse didn't get his first crack at facing the Twins until he came to the Brewers in 2013. He allowed six runs on eight hits in 4 2/3 innings in an 8-6 loss at Target Field on May 30, 2013 and didn't face Minnesota in 2014.
Milwaukee won 10-5 when Lohse started against Minnesota on June 5 of this season, but he did not factor in the decision after giving up five runs in six innings.
Lohse may have not received another chance at completing the milestone had he not beaten the Twins on Friday, as the right-hander's future is in jeopardy with his contract expiring after the season.
"It's pretty cool," Lohse said. "These guys tell me that I'm old and I've been around, but that's only the third time I've faced them so it's not like I've faced them a whole bunch of times and haven't beaten them.
"It's an accomplishment I'm proud of. I've been around and that proves I've had some longevity and done some things in this game. So I'll go home happy about that."
The Arizona Diamondbacks and Tampa Bay Rays joined Major League Baseball as expansion teams in 1997, meaning the list of those who have achieved the aforementioned feat is full of relatively recent pitchers.
Dan Haren was the last to join the club, as he did so in 2013. The other pitchers to have defeated all 30 current teams include Al Leiter, Kevin Brown, Terry Muholland, Curt Schilling, Woody Williams, Jamie Moyer, Randy Johnson, Barry Zito, Javier Vasquez, Vincente Padilla, Derek Lowe and A.J. Burnett.
"It's a great accomplishment," Counsell said. "To me, its a great sign of longevity. Any time you do something only 14 players have ever done, it puts you in good company."

Law enforcement officials say credit card fraud appears to be the latest frontier for violent gangs eager to make a quick buck. NY1 Criminal Justice Reporter Dean Meminger tells us about a major bust in Brooklyn.
"The Hoodstarz are a notorious gang that has terrorized parts of Brooklyn for years," said NYPD Assistant Chief James Essig.
That's what gangs usually do with guns, violence and drugs. But the NYPD and Brooklyn DA's office say several gangs in the Brownsville area were heavily into credit card fraud as well.
"I can say this Dean, that we know for sure that some of these people made this their full time job," said Brooklyn DA Eric Gonzalez. "That this is how they committed their life to doing this credit card fraud."
Investigators say alleged gang members printed thousands of illegal credit cards using real and fake names. They bought the card numbers from hackers who sell stolen identification and financial data over encrypted websites, what's known as the "dark web."
The members of Hoodstarz and other crews such as Folk Nation and 823 Crips then used the bogus cards to rent expensive cars and buy everything from concert tickets to food.
"One of the defendants a man named Tyrone Sexton — was apparently a big fan of the store American Girl and he allegedly bought expensive dolls," Gonzalez said.
Detectives say once the gang members printed up the fake credit cards, they needed to figure out if they were working. So, they came to muni meters and simply charged a dollar to see which ones were good.
But it wasn't all about having a good time. The gangs are accused of violence, drug dealing and buying guns with money from stolen cards.
"Sixteen have been involved in shooting incidents," said NYPD Assistant Chief Essig. "Seventeen have been arrested for weapons position. Twenty five have been arrested for robberies."
"We found a man who owned a gun in which an eight-year-old relative brought to his school," said District Attorney Gonzalez.
In all, 35 people have been arrested. As part of the case — for the first time, the Brooklyn DA was able to obtain a warrant to monitor direct messages between individual Facebook users. Until now, they only tracked public posts about gang violence.
"For those who are from Brownsville this is the end of Hoodstarz violence," said NYPD Commissioner James O'Neill.
And cops are looking to make more arrests.
IN THE North Star tattoo parlour in downtown Manhattan, Brittany shows off her ink: a Banksy-inspired tableau covering both feet. Now a student at New York University, she hopes to be a lawyer one day. “That's why I got the tattoo on my feet,” she says. “It's easy to hide.”
Once the preserve of prisoners, sailors and circus freaks, tattoos have become a benign rite of passage for many Americans. One in five adults has one, and two in five thirty-somethings. These days women with tattoos outnumber men. But what happens when these people look for work? Alas, not everyone is as savvy as Brittany.

Though increasingly mainstream, tattoos still signal a certain rebelliousness that works against jobseekers, says Andrew Timming of the University of St Andrews in Scotland. In a forthcoming study, Mr Timming and colleagues asked participants to assess job candidates based on their pictures, some of which were altered to add a neck tattoo. Inked candidates consistently ranked lower, despite being equally qualified. In a separate study Mr Timming found that many service-sector managers were squeamish about conspicuous ink, particularly when filling jobs that involve dealing with customers.
Designs of flowers or butterflies were deemed comparatively acceptable. And some workplaces are more open-minded: a prison-services manager explained that having tattoos made it easier to bond with inmates. Firms with a younger clientele are also more tattoo-friendly. But by and large the more visible the tattoo, the more “unsavoury” a candidate seemed—even if the boss had one.
Such prejudice may seem anachronistic, but it is not unfounded. Empirical studies have long linked tattoos with deviant behaviour. People with inked skin are more likely to carry weapons, use illegal drugs and get arrested. The association is stronger for bigger tattoos, or when there are several, says Jerome Koch, a sociologist at Texas Tech University.
This may help explain the army's recent decision to reinstate old grooming standards. These restrict the size and number of tattoos, ban ink from the neck, head and hands, and bar body art that might be seen as racist, sexist or otherwise inappropriate. The change is intended to promote discipline and professionalism. But it is making it harder to recruit to the army, says Major Tyler Stewart, who handles recruitment in Arizona. His battalion is turning away 50 tattooed people a week.
Some aspiring soldiers and other jobseekers are solving the problem by getting their ink removed. Tattoo-removal has surged 440% in the past decade, according to IBISWorld, a market-research firm. At the North Star, where Brittany's friend is getting a question-mark inked on her wrist, the prospect of such buyer's remorse seems remote. “I don't think it will help her job prospects,” observes Brittany, “but hopefully it won't hurt, either.”
WASHINGTON — President Obama shook off an electoral drubbing on Wednesday and said he was eager to find common ground with Republicans during the final two years of his presidency, but he swiftly defied their objections by vowing to bypass Congress and use his executive authority to change the nation's immigration system.
In a sign of how he intends to govern under a new political order with ascendant Republican leaders, Mr. Obama renewed his commitment to act on his own to allow millions of undocumented immigrants to stay in the country.
His remarks, at a news conference in the East Room of the White House, were meant to put the vitriol of the campaign behind him — he responded to disaffected Americans by saying that “I hear you” and that his election mandate was to “get stuff done.” But his promised action on immigration underscored the profound partisan disagreements that persist in Washington.
France's top diplomat is pressing a French-Swiss cement manufacturer to rethink its bid to sell the United States material to build President Trump's proposed border wall.
French Foreign Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault said Thursday that while construction giant LafargeHolcim can do what they want as a private company, the company should consider the social responsibility it has and the fact that the move could hurt its business with other clients.
"It should reflect upon what its interests are. There are other clients who will be stunned by this," Ayrault told France Info radio. "Lafarge says it doesn't do politics. ... Very well, but I would say companies ... also have social and environmental responsibilities."
THE WEEK IN PICTURES
The comments from Ayrault came a few days after LafargeHolcim CEO Eric Olsen said he was prepared to supply the materials for the wall along the U.S.'s southern border with Mexico.
"We are the number-one cement group in the United States,” Olsen said, according to Agence France-Presse. “We are here to support the construction and development of the country. ... We are not a political organization."
Olsen added that LafargeHolcim has production sites in Texas and operations in New Mexico and Arizona, three of the four U.S. states bordering Mexico. The group has also built two plants in Maryland and Oklahoma and opened facilities in New York and Missouri in anticipation of Trump's big infrastructure push.
Trump wants billions of dollars to start building a wall at the Mexican border and fund efforts to find, jail and deport immigrants in the country illegally. This call has created a rocky relationship with Mexico, which is the U.S.'s third-largest trade partner. Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto canceled a trip to Washington after Trump signed a presidential order kick-starting construction of a border wall and demanding that Mexico pay for it.
Besides its pledge to supply cement for the border wall, LafargeHolcim recently admitted that its business in northern Syria had struck "unacceptable" deals with armed groups, providing funds in order to allow its local activities to continue.
The group said in a statement that an internal investigation has established Lafarge's local branch in Syria provided funds to armed groups via middlemen in 2013 and 2014 to guarantee safe passage for company employees and supply the plant it operated.
Lafarge merged with Swiss company Holcim to create LafargeHolcim, the world's largest cement maker, in 2015. Lafarge stopped operating its $680 million Syrian plant in September 2014.
LafargeHolcim said, "In hindsight, the measures taken in order to continue the plant's activity were unacceptable."

This is a step in the right direction for those who want to crush dissent. It's also yet another step in the direction of the end of Twitter.
For Examples 1 and 2, the solution is easy: she blocks anyone who says something she doesn't like, and she won't see their tweets. Others will see them talking about her, but she's not directly impacted. If she reports anyone for abuse, it would only be to keep them from talking to others about her. In case you don't understand why that's a bad thing, should someone you oppose politically be able to control what you say about them? If Valenti lies about something and you politely point out how she lied, wouldn't she be tempted to report you for "abuse"?
For Example 3, there's already a legal solution provided by existing laws.
This is all about silencing those who disagree, it has nothing to do with safety.

Yet the network's claim can be true only in the most deceptive – in other words, the most Clintonian – sense. Instead of what the meaning of the word is is, CNN is parsing what the word indicate means.
CNN's broadside of Ted Cruz is wrong. The network has denied that it bears any responsibility for Cruz's camp spreading rumors that Ben Carson might be quitting the presidential race. CNN anchor Brooke Baldwin even went so far as to call Cruz's explanation "BS" on the air.
Somewhat ironically, the network rests much of its case on tweets rather than on-air coverage. CNN concedes that during the Iowa caucuses the network reported that Carson would not be going from Iowa to New Hampshire as the other candidates would. But after Cruz's people used the report as their reason for suggesting Carson might be getting out of the race, CNN on Wednesday declared, "Senator Cruz's claims about CNN are false. At no point did the network indicate Dr. Carson would suspend his campaign."
While their embeds in the field may never have specifically reported that Carson was out, the network's live coverage – which included star anchor and face of CNN Anderson Cooper – not only operated on the assumption that Carson was withdrawing, but actually included speculation of where his voters would go after Carson left the race.
Cooper even said Carson's stated reason – that he was going to Florida to get fresh clothes – for not going directly to New Hampshire like the other candidates "has got to be the weirdest explanation I've heard."
One of Cooper's panelists then suggested that "maybe Carson should take a page from Martin O'Malley's book and call it quits for the good of the party and the good of the country."
Then, working on the assumption that Carson was leaving the race, the panel began to speculate on who would pick up Carson's voters, with Democrat operative Paul Begala suggesting, "I think they go with Cruz."
Here's a transcript of this segment of CNN's live Iowa coverage:
[ANDERSON] COOPER: Let me ask about Dr. Carson because he's now in the fourth place with a 10 percent. Word from his campaign was that he's not going to go to New Hampshire; he's going to go down to Florida. Then his campaign put out a statement saying, the reason he's going to Florida is because he needs to change clothes. He gets to get some new clothes. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Oh, Anderson. COOPER: Which has got to be the weirdest explanation I've heard. I mean, frankly, I've been wearing this suit for four days. I'm going to have something FedEx to me when I go to New Hampshire on Wednesday and that's better of course. [22:14:56] UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Well, welcome to the Carson campaign. And maybe Carson should take a page from Martin O'Malley's books and call it quits for the good of the party and the good of the country. You know, whether it was the Egyptian pyramid grain silo debate that we all ended up having to have, or any number of... [DAVID] AXELROD: The war against [inaudible]? COOPER: He's got 10 percent of the vote but where did his voters go. PAUL BEGALA, DEOMOCRATIC [sic] STRATEGIST: I think they go with Cruz.
The printed word doesn't fully capture the CNN panel's air of incredulity over Carson's stated reason for not going on to New Hampshire. Watching live, it was obvious that the moderator and the panel felt that Carson's campaign was toast.
As stated earlier, much of CNN's defense is built around tweets from reporter Chris Moody, in which Moody reported that Carson would not be going to New Hampshire and, later, that Carson would be continuing his campaign.
Yet CNN's on-air panel was expressing their disbelief at the latter point. The reason CNN's live coverage is particularly pertinent to Cruz's case is that at Cruz's headquarters, as Wolf Blitzer said, "they're watching CNN right now."
Thus, CNN's live coverage was reinforcing the Cruz camp's apparent opinion that Carson was leaving the race.
Does this legitimize the Cruz people's actions? That's arguable.
But for CNN to claim that its coverage played no role in them is not.
Sorry, Ms. Baldwin, but for CNN to bluster that "at no point did the network indicate Dr. Carson would suspend his campaign" is the real BS.
And another example of why the public no longer trusts the media.
LeBron James cites earlier examples before he joined the Heat of what he considers to be superteams. (0:30)
While LeBron James disagrees with the assertion that he started the so-called superteam era in the NBA, he took satisfaction from Draymond Green taking time out of the Golden State Warriors' championship parade Thursday to mention his name.
James appeared as a guest on the "Road Trippin'" podcast hosted by Cavs players Richard Jefferson and Channing Frye and sideline reporter Allie Clifton and addressed the latest round of trash talk between the Warriors and Cleveland Cavaliers, which spilled onto social media Thursday with Green and James taking swipes at each other on Instagram.
Aside from wearing a T-shirt mocking the Cavs' early exit from the Finals and making fun of James' new haircut that makes the 32-year-old look bald, Green also declared, "You started the superteam, bro!" while quoting James' statement that he never played on a superteam.
"No," James said when Green's superteam comments came up in the episode released Friday. "No. I mean in 2003, the Lakers combined Karl Malone, Gary Payton, Shaq and Kobe. And in '96, when Jordan was retired, the Rockets joined Charles Barkley, Hakeem Olajuwon and Clyde Drexler all on the same team.
"But I don't look at it as ... I definitely didn't start the superteam, if that's what he's trying to say. But I just feel like that it's great that on the day you're celebrating your championship, my likeness and my name is in your head. I love that."
The common denominator between those Lakers and Rockets teams and the modern-day Warriors is that all three franchises had a championship core in place when they added their heralded piece or pieces to try to earn another ring.
Both superteams that James is credited with creating in Miami in 2010 and in Cleveland in 2014 involved major talent coming together on a team that weren't contending for championships immediately before their arrival.
"People forget, when you went to Miami, they had just lost in the first round. And you added Chris Bosh," Jefferson said. "I just remember when people talk about superteams and this and that and putting people together, it would have been like if you had joined the Boston Celtics after you had lost to them. To put it in comparison, the Golden State Warriors have been the best team the last three years. They broke NBA records for the last three years, and they added probably the second-best talent in the NBA."
James spoke glowingly of the Warriors' acquisition, Kevin Durant, who ended up being the MVP of Golden State's 4-1 dismissal of Cleveland in the NBA Finals.
"He's a talent of his own," James said of Durant. "A guy that's damn-near 7-foot that handles the ball the way he does, the athletic ability that he has and the shooting, the ability to shoot the ball from anywhere -- he's just a rare talent that our league hasn't seen."
Ezra Shaw/Getty Images
The co-hosts, who produce their podcast on James' Uninterrupted multimedia platform -- which also produces Green's "Dray Day" podcast -- had some fun with the public spat between James and Green.
"The other guy is such a great guy, and it's like gentleman banter back and forth," Frye said, purposely not calling Green by name.
"Oh, yeah," James replied. "For sure."
"It's like, this is the greatest day you could have arguably in your life and you're talking to us," Frye later said. "That's cool, though."
"Absolutely," James concurred. "Absolutely."
"The one thing I will say ..." Jefferson began to say.
"Is that he's ugly?" Frye interjected. "Edit that, please."
Frye said he would have been able to trash-talk more had he played more in the Finals. He appeared in one of the five games, scoring two points on 1-for-5 shooting with three rebounds. Green averaged 11 points, 10.2 rebounds and 4.8 assists per game in the Finals.
"If I had scored eight to 12 points total, I'd be talking the most s---," Frye said. "Dude, let me. I would have Wikipedia'd this life, dawg. I would have had the internet killing him all over the place. I was like, I wish he would have put me in. Oh, [Tyronn Lue], put me in for this reason alone. I'm ready, dawg. Listen. But I can't say s---. I can't say anything. This f---ing sucks."
Jefferson, Frye and Clifton also brought up James' new hairdo. James said he had talked to his teammates about cutting his hair for months.
"I've been telling you guys," James said. "So it wasn't like I just woke up and was like, '[Gasp], it's time.' No."
"You mean the Dubs didn't make you do it, is what you're saying," Clifton replied, referring to Green's Instagram post.
"No," James said. "Of course not. If that was the case, I would have grown an Afro."
Jefferson, who will turn 37 next week, said on the podcast that he is considering retirement once again. Shortly after the Cavs' Game 7 win over the Warriors in the 2016 Finals, Jefferson called it a career before changing his mind and signing a two-year, $5.1 million contract to return.
"I don't know what I'm about to do next season," Jefferson said. "The only way I would come back would be if these m-----f-----s figure this s--- out. Honestly, at the end of the day, coming back alone was not only worth the experience but also worth 'Road Trippin',' man. This s--- was cool, man, because we gave fans something that they had never f---ing seen."
James did not try to sway Jefferson either way.
"Whatever you do, RJ, you know you got a home here," James said. "You got a home here in Cleveland."
The podcast was recorded Thursday night before the Cavs met for their final team dinner of the season. James said he planned to be back in the gym Friday to stay ready for next season.
"My motivation? It hasn't changed," James said. "My motivation hasn't stopped. It's just 'Strive for greatness.' My motivation don't change. I can't stop. I refuse to stop."
The child's safety blanket that can stop a bullet: $1,000 fabric can also help protect children from falling debris from tornadoes
5/16-inch thick rectangle features backpack straps to keep it in place
Made of high-density plastic used for ballistic armor that is lighter than Kevlar
Can protect from debris from a tornado - or bullets from a 9 mm handgun
An Oklahoma company has created a protective blanket that developers say could give children a better chance of surviving debris from a tornado - or bullets from a 9 mm handgun.
The Bodyguard Blanket, made by ProTecht, is a bulletproof pad designed to protect students during disasters at school.
The 5/16-inch thick rectangle features backpack-like straps that allow users to put it on, and then duck and cover.

The Bodyguard Blanket can protect students from tornado debris or bullets during school disasters.
HOW IT WORKS The blanket is made of Dyneema, a high-density plastic used for ballistic armor that is lighter than Kevlar. Normally used by U.S. soldiers while in battle, it is qual to or exceeds the protection used by police departments.
The firm claims the Bodyguard blanket provides bullet resistant protection against 90% of all weapons that have been used in school shootings in the United States.
It has been classified to protect against various projectiles, including 9 mm and .22-caliber bullets.
Steve Walker developed the pad, The Oklahoman reported.
Walker started on the idea after a massive tornado struck last year in Moore, killing 24 people including seven children inside an elementary school that didn't have a tornado shelter.
'We're trying to stop that blunt-force trauma when that rubble is falling down on a child, for instance,' said Walker, a podiatrist from Edmond.
He gave a sketch of the protective blanket to Stan Schone, an inventor and one of his patients, during an appointment.
The two form half of the executive team at ProTecht. The others are Jeff Quinn and Jay Hanan.
Hanan is an associate professor of mechanical and aerospace engineering at Oklahoma State University-Tulsa. He introduced the team to Dyneema, a high-density plastic used for ballistic armor that is lighter than Kevlar.
The new material also protects against nails, shards of metal and other sharp objects.
'Instead of bending over and hoping for the best, they're afforded an extra layer of protection,' Schone said.
The 5/16-inch thick rectangle features backpack-like straps that allow users to put it on, and then duck and cover.
The new material also protects against nails, shards of metal and other sharp objects.
At $1,000 per blanket, he and others with the company say buying one per student would be less expensive than building tornado shelters.
'By no means would we ever say that this is more protective,' Walker said.
'But when you have budget constraints, this might be a viable alternative.'
The blankets can be stored in classrooms until needed
ProTecht took a finished blanket to a shooting range and had it subjected to a National Institute of Justice Class 3A test, which is used to test body armor for police units.
The classification implies protection against various projectiles, including 9 mm and .22-caliber bullets.
It passed, Schone said.
The leftwing Human Rights Campaign has joined forces with two groups of pediatricians to urge parents and teachers to let children and teenagers choose their own ‘gender identity.'
The new advocacy booklet, “Supporting and Caring For Transgender Children,” is endorsed by the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American College of Osteopathic Pediatricians. The booklet begins with the story of Jazz Jennings, a boy who decided in 2007 that he is female. Now aged 16, Jazz is a transgender activist who also sells skin-care products for Johnson & Johnson.
The guide urges parents to let their children pick their own gender and to undergo irreversible sexual surgery:
Ideally, though, the child takes the lead in these decisions … Clinicians increasingly embrace a “gender-affirming” approach to children who are gender-expansive or transgender. This approach means focusing on what the child says about their own gender identity and expression, and allowing them to determine which forms of gender expression feel comfortable and authentic
The guide gives the impression that there are “many” unrecognized transgender children:
Misunderstandings about transgender children mean that many still don't get the support they deserve, and the consequences can be tragic. Fortunately, we know far more than ever before about what these children need to grow up safe and healthy. Across the United States and worldwide, policies and attitudes are changing to better support transgender kids.
To boost the number of gender-conflicted children, the advocacy book also create a new category of child — the “gender-expansive” child. That term is defined as, “Children who do not conform to their culture's expectations for boys or girls. Being transgender is one way of being gender-expansive, but not all gender-expansive children are transgender.”
Though a study of the 2010 census shows the population of transgender people amounts to one of every 2,400 Americans, or 0.03 percent of the adult population, HRC states the numbers of transgendered children are growing “as more families decide to affirm their child's gender identity.” That phrase suggests there are many additional unidentified transgender children because parents are just not affirming their “gender” choice.
HRC states its own commissioned poll found that “35 percent of U.S. likely voters know someone who is transgender,” while 12 percent of that group knew a transgender child or teen.”
The gay group and the medical groups say their guide is for “anyone who knows a transgender or gender-expansive child…and offers suggestions for adults with a transgender child in their life.”
The American Academy of Pediatrics has been a promoter of leftwing causes, especially Obamacare and the practice of urging pediatricians to ask their child patients about gun ownership during routine office visits. The organization has also issued a policy statement “urging pediatricians and politicians to work together” to “protect children from climate-related threats…”
The new push comes as President Barack Obama has begun strongly backing the new gender ideology, which says government should force Americans to accept other people's choice of apparent gender. This year, he threatened schools with funding cuts if they don't end the use of single-sex bathrooms and locker rooms. His administration also backed punishments for children who object to the elimination of distinct single-sex facilities or who refuse to use the female pronoun – ‘her' – when referring to boys who wish to live as girls, and urged schools to keep parents in the dark about their children's at-school gender-related activities.
Mainstream pediatricians and professionals are becoming very concerned about the mental health of children in America who are now being exposed to the Obama administration's promotion of gender ideology in schools and workplaces. These professionals signed onto an open letter that asserts the ideology is “putting the nation's children at risk.”
The American College of Pediatricians states gender ideology is harmful to children and that, by promoting gender fluidity in its school bathroom directive, the Obama administration is complicit in masking serious mental health issues in children.
The college states:
No one is born with a gender. Everyone is born with a biological sex. Gender (an awareness and sense of oneself as male or female) is a sociological and psychological concept; not an objective biological one… A person's belief that he or she is something they are not is, at best, a sign of confused thinking. When an otherwise healthy biological boy believes he is a girl, or an otherwise healthy biological girl believes she is a boy, an objective psychological problem exists that lies in the mind not the body, and it should be treated as such. These children suffer from gender dysphoria. Gender dysphoria (GD), formerly listed as Gender Identity Disorder (GID), is a recognized mental disorder in the most recent edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of the American Psychiatric Association (DSM-V)…
“According to the DSM-V, as many as 98% of gender confused boys and 88% of gender confused girls eventually accept their biological sex after naturally passing through puberty,” the College asserts. “Conditioning children into believing that a lifetime of chemical and surgical impersonation of the opposite sex is normal and healthful is child abuse.”
In contrast, HRC and its partner pediatricians' groups say “gender dysphoria” must be averted by making sure society comforts the child;
Depending on the child's age and signs of distress, “gender-affirmative” counseling or therapy can help manage gender dysphoria. However, in many cases, the remedy for dysphoria is gender transition: taking steps to affirm the gender that feels comfortable and authentic to the child. It is important to understand that, for children who have not reached puberty, gender transition involves no medical interventions at all: it consists of social changes like name, pronoun and gender expression.
However, once children have reached puberty, which could be any time between age 9 and 16, HRC and its partner pediatricians recommend body-altering drugs and irreversible surgery for children:
Children beginning puberty may also use puberty-suppressing medication as they explore their gender identity. Both of these steps are completely reversible. Social transition is equally important for adults and older adolescents. People in these age groups may also take additional steps, including gender-affirming hormone therapy and surgeries.
These recommendations clash with the recommendations of Youth Trans Critical Professionals – a group of self-described “left-leaning, open-minded, and pro-gay rights” professionals. The group says it is risky to affirm young people who claim to be transgender and provide them with hormonal and surgical treatments to change their bodies.
“Our concern is with medical transition for children and youth,” say Youth Trans Critical Professionals on their website. “We feel that unnecessary surgeries and/or hormonal treatments which have not been proven safe in the long-term represent significant risks for young people.”
“Policies that encourage — either directly or indirectly — such medical treatment for young people who may not be able to evaluate the risks and benefits are highly suspect, in our opinion,” says the organization, which is composed of psychologists, social workers, doctors, and other professionals.
The professionals express “alarm” that, because of the current trendiness of being transgendered, many young people have decided they are a member of the opposite sex simply as a result of “binges” on social media sites. They describe a process of transgender activists recruiting these young people for their “cult.”
“There is evidence that vulnerable young people are being actively recruited and coached on such sites to believe that they are trans,” the professionals say.
As noted, HRC and its partner pediatricians urge only “gender-affirmative” therapy. Youth Trans Critical Professionals view state prohibitions against other forms of therapy that may help young people evaluate their feelings as dangerous since they may block the process of critical thinking and evaluation of the young person regarding the reasons why he or she desires to become a transgender member of the opposite sex.
They explain:
While the sentiment behind this legislation is laudable, in some cases, it is being interpreted to mean that therapists cannot explore gender identity with a youth who is professing to be trans. This would mean we can't ask why; we can't explore underlying mental health issues; we can't consider the symbolic nature of the gender dysphoria; and we can't look at possible confounding issues such as social media use or social contagion.
The signers of the open letter write that radical progressives promoting the gender fluid policy for young people are “distorting the law” against a flood of opposition from “the overwhelming majority of Americans.”
They add:
In addition, considering all the possible actions the federal government should be taking to keep us safe — like addressing porous borders, rising terrorism, the weakening economy, the escalating collapse of the Middle East, rising crime rates, etc. — we firmly believe that, in setting bathroom, shower and locker room policies in local schools, the federal government has exceeded its authorities while putting our children's mental health at risk to politically-driven psychology and their very lives in peril at the hands of potential sexual predators.
The leaders urge others “to join us in opposing this grave threat to children and this abject rejection of law-making by self-government, that manner by which America's founders intended our constitutional system to function.”
Shadow International Development Secretary Mary Creagh has said that the failure of western governments to act against Bashar al-Assad in 2013 helped give rise to jihadist group ISIS. Writing for Progress Magazine, Creagh describes the vote that stopped the possibility of UK intervention in Syria as a “shock defeat” that “reverberated around the world”.
Following the use of chemical weapons in Syria two years ago, the Government put forward a motion to begin military action against Assad's regime. Creagh outlines the series of criteria Labour put forward that the proposed action would have to meet for the party to support it – and says there was a “widely held view that the doctrine of humanitarian intervention and the responsibility to protect give a legal basis for intervention.”
The former leadership candidate says that there was a belief in Labour ranks that their opposition to the Government proposal would not be enough to stop it:
“The assumption was that we would vote for our motion and lose, and then the Tories would put their motion and win. On any future government motion, specifically authorising air strikes, Labour would, in all probability, have backed the government.”
There are rumours that Cameron will again propose airstrikes in Syria this summer, this time targeting ISIS bases following the terrorist attack in Tunisia last month. Many believe Labour will support this action, although Jeremy Corbyn has already said he is opposed to the idea.
But Creagh says that the action now is a direct result of inaction two years ago, which she argues came from Cameron's failure “to do the heavy lifting with his backbenchers” and win enough support within his own party. The Wakefield MP writes:
“The west's failure to protect the Syrian people from Assad's state terror opened the door to Isis stepping in and offering resistance to his regime.”
Could this be the start of a new Labour position on Middle East intervention?
When is an earmark not an earmark?
Rep. Michele Bachmann supports a ban on earmarks in Congress, but she thinks that some transportation projects should redefine so they aren't considered earmarks.
Bachmann told the Star Tribune she supports a “redefinition” of what an earmark is, because, she said: “Advocating for transportation projects for ones district in my mind does not equate to an earmark.”
“I don't believe that building roads and bridges and interchanges should be considered an earmark,” Bachmann said. “There's a big difference between funding a tea pot museum and a bridge over a vital waterway.”
Bachmann, along with Minnesota Republican Rep. John Kline, has taken a pledge not to accept earmarks. Bachmann, who did solicit some earmarks when she first came to Congress, has been outspoken in pushing House Republicans to continue an earmark moratorium enacted last year.
Senate Republicans also could support a moratorium, after Minority Leader Mitch McConnell reversed his position today and said he backed the ban. They will vote on it this week.
Bachmann has not previously discussed changing the definition of earmarks to separate out district transportation projects. The Minnesota Republican said she talked about the idea with Rep. John Mica, in line to take over for Rep. Jim Oberstar as Transportation Committee chairman, about making the distinction.
Bachmann, for instance, backs federal support for the Stillwater Lift Bridge, which she blamed the Obama administration for not funding.
As Congress returned Monday for its lame duck session, earmarks were among the most contentious issues up for debate.
Bachmann was the featured speaker at a rally on Monday outside the Capitol sponsored by conservative-leaning group Americans for Prosperity, which is calling for an earmarks ban. At the rally, Bachmann declared to cheers that she was nominating the Tea Party to win Time's “Person of the Year.”
“You are the people who changed the world the first Tuesday in November,” Bachmann said. “You did it.”
On Monday, 18-year-old Zakia Abla called Boca Raton police to report a robbery.
But at the end of the day it wasn't Abla who was receiving information about victim services — she was the one leaving in handcuffs.
Police said Abla called police with a fake story about a robbery that had happened to her, when in reality she was the one committing the robbery.
According to the arrest report, Abla told officers a man whom she had recently met approached her outside of a friend's apartment just before 7 p.m. and tried to snatch her purse. As he ran away from her, she tossed a brick and hit him in the head.
He was bleeding, she said, but dropped her purse and went on his way.
She told officers she had met the man outside of a gas station a short while ago and exchanged numbers. He offered to sell her drugs and the two agreed to meet up. But on Monday, Abla said she didn't have enough money for the drugs, she told officers.
When the dealer showed, he robbed her, she said.
Meanwhile, the alleged drug dealer showed up at the hospital with a head injury. Police detained him — assuming he had committed a robbery — but he told a very different story.
According to the report, he had met Abla at the gas station and the two had arranged for a drug deal. He told officers he wanted the deal to go down in his car, but she insisted that she meet him at a friend's apartment. Wary of this exchange, he brought a friend along who waited in his car.
Abla invited him inside the apartment, but he refused, according to the report. When Abla wouldn't come out of the apartment, he had a hunch that he was set up. All of a sudden, a man wearing a red bandanna came out of the apartment door, grabbed a brick and bashed him in the head, according to the report.
He passed out momentarily in the parking lot and Abla stole $1 and his cell phone from his pockets. He and his friend then drove around trying to figure out to do.
He said he was scared to go to the hospital and talk to police because he was trying to do a drug deal, according to the report. Eventually, he and his friend broke down and sought medical help.
Officers went back to Abla's apartment to interview her again. They asked to go inside the apartment and she agreed. Inside, they found the drug dealer's phone and a red bandanna.
Abla told officers she had, in fact, been the instigator of the robbery according to the report. The plan was to entice the dealer inside, take his drugs and let him go. She said she only knew the man who helped her attack the dealer as "Zo."
During this investigation, officers also discovered Abla was wanted for a different theft case. In March, she was accused of stealing two PlayStation game consoles from a former friend and selling them for cash.
She is charged with robbery, aggravated battery and petit theft for Monday's incident. She faces additional charges of burglary and grand theft from the March incident.
She is being held at the Palm Beach County Jail on $26,000 bail.

In April 2013, inspired by Team Hoyt, Steen and Peder Mondrup started on a journey to prove that there are no barriers for disabled people in sports.

It was late when Steen and Peder Mondrup arrived at the finish line. But it was loud. The crowd went crazy as the 34-year-old twins came down the red carpet in front of Christiansborg Castle. Their finish was one of the most spectacular at KMD IRONMAN Copenhagen, comparable with that of Danish winner Henrik Hyldelund. The twins came out of the darkness of the run course into the bright lights of the finish line 15:42:38 after they had started.
Team Hoyt
In 1989, Team Hoyt tackled the IRONMAN World Championship for the first time to write an unbelievable part of triathlon history. Dick Hoyt pulled, pedaled and pushed his disabled son Rick through the course in 14:26:08. Since they had started running, cycling and competing in triathlon events together, Team Hoyt has competed in more than 250 triathlons, including six IRONMAN races. In 2008 they were inducted to the IRONMAN Hall of Fame.
Team Hoyt inspired Steen Mondrup. A couple of years ago the Dane discovered a video on YouTube that featured Team Hoyt. Steen was fascinated by the love and the strong bond between father and son and started to ask himself why he couldn't do the same thing for his his disabled twin brother, Peder.
When Peder and Steen Mondrup were born in January, 1980, they were three months early and weighed only 1,200 g each. Steen has no disabilities, but Peder is confined to a wheelchair due to lack of oxygen during birth. After starting to run together, they decided to take on the biggest challenge of their live as twins—completing an IRONMAN event.
On race day Steen pulled his brother through the swim at Amager beach park in a kayak, finishing in a remarkable 1:31:12. It took Team Twin 8:16:54 to finish the windy ride through the surrounding area of the capital city of Denmark and through numerous rolling hills on their custom made bicycle. Despite the challenge, they were inspired by the overwhelming support on the course.
"My body works just as hard at Steen's does in a race," says Peder. "I have to focus on staying upright and to relax as much as possible to keep my spasms at ease."
Despite all the challenges, they had fun along the way—spectators saw them laughing and joking with each other during their journey which finally ended after a 5:28 marathon.
Now the Mondrup twins want to pursue their dream and offer people with different handicaps the chance to participate in sports and other sports events. They want to give disabled people the chance to feel the joy and pride of racing and crossing a finish line.
"Hopefully we can arrange the world's first triathlon training camps for disabled in 2015," Steen says. To that end they have established the non-profit Team Twin Association. "We are really excited about this next step for Team Twin. The work has already begun and will now get our full attention." Crossing the finish line at KMD IRONMAN Copenhagen was just the beginning.
There are basic rules of chess strategy that we learn as soon as we start playing chess. One of the most fundamental premises is the importance of the center. We quickly learn that one of the major goals of positional chess is control over the center. The dream of the majority of openings is the so-called "perfect pawn center."
Many chess textbooks from my youth used the following famous game as an example of benefits of the perfect pawn center.
Indeed, the final position is quite picturesque.
After seeing a remarkable game like this, a young chess player might easily perceive a strong link between the "perfect pawn center" and beautiful attacking play.
I don't remember any chess books that followed the aforementioned gem with this relatively little-known Morphy game.
As you can see, we have the same opening and the same "perfect pawn center," but the result is totally different! So, what's going on? Well, we already touched on a similar subject in this article.
As GM John Nunn correctly explained in his book "Understanding Chess Move By Move": "A pawn center well supported by pieces is desirable, whereas one that is overextended and vulnerable is not. The dividing line between these two cases is often quite fine, and may depend on tactical nuances specific to the given position." The emphasis is mine.

We can argue that in Morphy's game the lack of development of Black's pieces was striking; hence the result. However, what about the next two games where White's pieces were fully developed, yet once again the results were totally opposite.
VIENNA, Austria – Thriving e-bike and especially e-MTB sales pushed up the Austrian market in 2016. The number of sold e-MTBs increased by no less than 80% from 16,666 units in 2015 to 30,000 last year. Austria's industry organization Arge Fahrrad reported a total market volume of 86.546 e-bikes in 2016.

E-bikes are now holding an impressive 21.8% market share in Austria's overall bicycle sales. According to Arge Fahrrad, “Austria's e-bike market share is now ranking third after the Netherlands and Belgium but it is bigger than in Switzerland and Germany.” The e-bike market has been growing steadily since 2012. “Particularly the hike in e-MTB sales last year led to higher average retail prices due to the complexity and the more technical parts used on e-MTBs,” said Arge Fahrrad PR spokesman Alexander Raffeiner.
Stable market volume
According to Arge Fahrrad's bicycle market statistics over 2016 a total of 310,454 non-motorized bicycles were sold, resulting in a total market volume of some 397,000 units. Last year the Austria bicycle market grew by 1.8 % from 390,000 in 2015. “This number confirms that the Austrian market is still hovering around a yearly volume of 400,000 units. Depending on the previous season and possible inventory this number will vary a little bit year by year,” states Raffeiner.
Impressive average sales price
The growth in e-bike sales resulted in an increase of the average retail price by 15.4% to € 900. The highest average price is generated by IBDs as it increased to € 1,150, up 9.5%. However, the average retail price in the sporting goods retail rose to € 650; an impressive increase of 27.5% compared to 2015. This is a clear indication that the Austrian sporting goods retail, who used to have a more price-aggressive strategy offering private label bicycles, is now also taking its share of the growing e-bike market. Those days that the e-bike was exclusively handled by the IBDs are over in Austria.
A full report with all statistics on the Austrian market will be published in the May issue of Bike Europe.
How breaking up big undertakings into smaller chunks not only increases productivity, but eases anxiety. What was once daunting, becomes manageable.
By Sam Yang - Get similar updates here
The most valuable time management tool I use in my day-to-day life is a timer. I was first introduced to the importance of a timer while working on my fitness. Instead of long durations, I found short bursts of high-intensity training not only saved me time but offered me better results. Now, this is conventional wisdom for all athletes, even endurance runners. But time management and productivity are not limited to athletics, it can be applied to work, learning, and everything else. The limits of its uses are the limits of your imagination.
You can't maintain focus for long. This is why we all joke that we have ADD even when we do not. But for most of us, it's not ADD, it's being human. Humans cannot hyperfocus for long durations. Our minds are meant for novelty, this is why we proliferated. What inventions and innovations would there be if we just stood there staring at the savanna all day? Our brains aren't wired this way, which is why when we try, we feel like we're going mad.
We have been studying the benefits of distributed practice since the 1800s. The most famous method being the Pomodoro technique. Developed by Francesco Cirillo, it's named after the Italian word for "tomato"—as a university student Cirillo used a tomato-shaped kitchen timer as a productivity aid. Cirillo's technique breaks work down into increments of 25 minutes followed by a short break. Just as with exercise, it's difficult to maintain intensity for long. Something will give: either you burn out or get distracted. In the case of exercise, you'll injure yourself. In the case of work, you'll increase your anxiety and stress. But with time chunking, the daunting becomes manageable.
Break Up Your Work Into Chunks
With the Pomodoro, after each round of work, you take a short break, anywhere from three to five minutes. You do this for four rounds, then you can take a longer break, 15-30 minutes. This is similar to the Tabata method for physical training where you break up short rounds of intensity with short breaks, then take a longer break after eight rounds. But the magic is in the breaks, they give your mind and body the time to download all the work you've done without overload. You're maximizing your biology.
Tweak to It Match Your Personality
However, tweak the intervals to match your personality. I find 20 minute time chunks work best for me. This was after some experimentation; you can't break up an hour into 25-minute chunks, and 30 minutes was too long. For people I've taught this to, they've either lengthened or shortened the chunks and breaks and modified the total number of rounds to fit their individual personalities.
Let Your Personality Dictate the Method
What I've learned from years of coaching martial arts is that the technique must match the personality of the user. It's not about the right technique or even the right technique for their body type. The mind supersedes the body, so the key is to find the best method for the type of mind that you have (you can also change your mindset, as I've written about previously, but what works best is somewhere in the middle). 25 minutes may be traditional, but that may not be practical for some. Some may do better with 10-minute rounds and 5-minute breaks.
I call it the personality-based method. Productivity is all about getting stuff done, and if the method doesn't match your personality, you're not going to do it. From chess masters to star athletes, half of what they do is about efficiency, but the other half is personality. If what we do doesn't express even a little bit of ourselves, again, it will drive us mad. (We need just that bit of ownership.)
Some people will abandon valuable techniques if they aren't given permission to break the rules. For example, in politics, elites smugly say that some folks vote against their economic best interests. But what's really happening is, some people value personal freedom over rigid policies. They will abandon something possibly valuable if it means too many rules. This is human, and human psychology applies to all that we do. Fortunately, personal productivity is much simpler. Just as with any innovation, no permission is needed to make changes. Do it, and if it works for you, it works for you. Find your own personal effective dosage of time. However, first learn the standard rules; the rules are the framework to build your own system upon. Only then can you forget about boilerplate figures and cookie-cutter numbers.
President Trump blasted Democrats for funding the creation of a dossier containing salacious allegations against the president just one day after the revelation that Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign and the Democratic National Committee paid for the controversial document.
"I think it's very sad what they've done with this fake dossier. It was made up," Trump told reporters at the White House as he departed for Texas on Wednesday.
The so-called "Trump dossier" was compiled by an opposition research firm, Fusion GPS, during the 2016 race and alleged, among other things, Russians obtained compromising material on Trump and Trump's associates colluded with Russians during the race.

Paul Ryan backs House subpoena to the FBI
Many of the claims contained in the dossier have not been substantiated, and those that have been are reportedly unrelated to claims of Russian collusion.
"Hillary Clinton always denied it. The Democrats always denied it, and now only because it's going to come out in a court case, they said, yes they did it," Trump said on Wednesday. Indeed, the House Intelligence Committee had filed a subpoena to Fusion's bank in an effort to learn who paid for the dossier. Although Fusion had asked a judge to prevent the subpoena, the identity of the funding source still emerged Tuesday evening in a Washington Post report.
DNC officials said the current chairman, Tom Perez, was unaware the DNC had agreed to pay for a portion of the dossier's costs. Clinton's lawyer, Marc Elias, who entered into the agreement with Fusion on behalf of the Clinton campaign and the DNC, had previously denied to reporters that he was involved with the creation of the dossier.

Obama administration officials told the AP that while the report did not much in the way of new intelligence, the scope and details included were important. And, according to the AP, the fact that the report comes from the UN "could prove valuable as the Obama administration lobbies governments around the world to toughen their own sanctions against Iran."
The AP reported that the US officials contacted by the news agency stayed away from saying that the international community was moving closer to military action.
The Guardian reported that Israel is also expected to call for tougher sanctions against Iran. An Israeli official told the paper that his government "hopes the [IAEA] report serves to galvanise international support for beefing up action."
More from GlobalPost: Iran claims to have proof of US-led terror plots
The UN report, issued by the International Atomic Energy Agency, stated "serious concerns" that Iran is secretly working toward building a nuclear weapon.
"The information indicates that Iran has carried out activities relevant to the development of a nuclear device," the report said.
"Dog" was Max Rockatansky's faithful blue-heeler in Mad Max 2.
Contents show]
History
At some point after Max left civilization following the loss of his family he encountered an Australian Cattle Dog, he took it into his care and it became a faithful companion of his.
"Dog" was eventually killed by a crossbow dart from one of Lord Humungus' Marauders.
Casting and on-screen performance
Miller originally thought that "Dog" would be a BS three legged canine called 'Trike'.[1][2] Unfortunately it became difficult to find and train such a dog so a decision had been made to include a four legged dog, but with exceptional character. The filmmakers auditioned over 100 dogs to no avail until visiting the dog pound at Yagoona. There they found a two year old Australian Cattle Dog (according to Miller, a half-breed of wild dingo and sheep collie) scheduled to be put down. The dog fetched a rock Miller had thrown and brought it back to his feet. It was enough for the director to make the decision of casting the dog. It was later found out that the dog did the same to everyone.
The R.S.P.C.A. rule stated, however that the dog be de-sexed upon leaving the pound. Miller tried explaining that such a procedure would not be existing in his post-apocalyptic vision of Mad Max and it was decided in a questionable compromise that the dog undergoes vasectomy. Three months later the dog was ready for his first acting role, but immediately a problem occurred as he became very scared while filming. One of the crew members discovered that loud engine noises are what caused the dog to literally soil itself, so the solution was to put cotton in dog's ears. It worked.
The dog was very fond of actor Bruce Spence who played the Gyro Captain. It caused minor issues with the dog being virtually unable to bark at and be aggressive towards the actor. Miller solved this problem by clever editing techniques that give the appearance of hostility between the two. A prime example of this is a scene of the Gyro Captain fighting with "Dog" over a snake. It's visible that "Dog" was actually playing with the actor, but with help of overdubbed barking and slight editing it gave the impression that he was attacking the Gyro Captain.[3]
After filming, everyone wanted to adopt the dog because he was so affectionate. After a big argument[4], it was finally decided that the dog was going to be adopted by stunt coordinator Max Aspin and his wife Dale who was the animal handler, trainer and a stunt performer herself. The dog, being a Blue Heeler, continued doing what he did best - rounding up animals around the farm and also eating the chickens. He was eventually handed to the care of another Mad Max 2 stuntman - Gary Gauslaa with whom he lived out the rest of his days.[5]

Donald Trump is upping his attacks on Hillary Clinton following the FBI's decision not to recommend indicting her over her use of a private email server while serving as secretary of state.
In a video posted late Tuesday on Facebook, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee says a "rigged system" helped Clinton "escape criminal charges."
But, in announcing Clinton was "extremely careless" in handling classified information, FBI Director James Comey "did indict her today for her incredible lack of judgment and honesty," the post reads.
The 62-second video shows Clinton saying "I did not send or receive any information that was marked classified at the time."
It then cuts back to Comey's Tuesday press briefing, saying "From the group of 30,000 emails returned to the State Department in 2014, 110 emails in 52 email chains have been determined by the owning agency to contain classified information at the time they were sent or received."
A hydrogen explosion destroys the reactor building of the Fukushima #3 reactor, Japan on 14th March. The wisdom of venting hydrogen into the confines of the reactor building will be one of many questions asked in the weeks and months ahead. Picture courtesy of the BBC
Yesterday, I believe, will go down in history as one of the most significant for mankind. Whilst most citizens of the developed and developing world do not realise this yet, the future of the human global energy system has just changed course with potentially far reaching consequences for human civilisation.
With a breach of the containment system of the Fukushima #2 reactor and release of significant amounts of radiation, we now have the answer to whether or not nuclear power is safe. In the eyes of the public and politicians the answer will be no, even before the final tally of nuclear casualties is counted. Looking to the future, the question should boil down to whether or not the risks of nuclear accidents are outweighed by the benefits to society of nuclear electricity. But in the current environment, and for years to come the risks are going to dominate government thinking and the benefits, all too readily ignored at present will be forgotten completely until we begin to feel the consequences of growing reliance on expensive fossil fuel imports and intermittent renewable energy.
It often takes a disaster to test our systems and to bring into the public domain certain frailties that may exist. The Fukushima catastrophe has brought into the public eye frailties than most were not concerned about until Saturday 12th March 2011 when news of the reactor problems broke following the earthquake and tsunami of the previous day. Fukushima's fate was sealed on the day the Japanese government gave approval for the reactors to be built on a coastline where there was a high probability of earthquake and tsunami in the plant's lifetime. The risks were known and understood and the facility was engineered to a high specification to withstand such events. For three days, the fate of the global nuclear industry has hung in the balance. Had the Japanese engineers managed to contain the incident then it was possible that the nuclear industry could emerge strengthened with proof that well designed and maintained American reactors could withstand the worst that nature can throw. But alas, this is not the case.
In granting consent to build these reactors the Japanese government, with little to no supplies of indigenous primary energy such as coal, oil and natural gas, must have decided that benefits to Japan of providing over 30% of electricity from nuclear sources outweighed the risks of building nuclear plant in one of the seismically most active regions of the world. Not only did they consent to build, but they built 4 reactors in close proximity to each other, right on the coast where they would feel the maximum effect of any tsunami. The coastal location proves beneficial now since this provides ready access to cooling water, much of the radiation released will fall on the sea and not on land, and there is reduced risk of pollution of ground water. But had they been built on higher ground a short way inland then they would not have been hit by the tsunami in the first place. How such risks have been weighed will go under the microscope in the weeks and months ahead. Building a cluster like this is no doubt based on a shared defence system, but it has been surprising to watch hydrogen explosions in one reactor compromise neighbouring reactor buildings. Were these risks properly weighed?
It has also been instructive to learn that steel and concrete containment systems alone are not sufficient to guarantee safety. Maintaining the engineering ability to pump water through the core after emergency shutdown means that pumps, pipes and valves located outside of the armoured core defence systems must also continue to function, and as is the case with many disasters, damage inflicted by the disaster itself may compromise the safety systems and their backup. In the case of Fukushima, the plant survived the initial onslaught of earthquake and tsunami. Damage inflicted at that stage set in motion a sequence of events, starting with the venting of hydrogen gas and the explosions they caused, and further degraded the capability to contain an escalating crisis. In terms of reactor design, it strikes me as odd that hydrogen should be vented into the confines of the reactor building, effectively creating a bomb. Have these eventualities been anticipated by the engineers who designed the plant?
And so what will become of Fukushima and the future of the global nuclear industry? As I write the reactor site is being rendered uninhabitable by the release of radiation and I imagine in the days ahead we will see heroic Japanese engineers risking their lives in an extreme hostile environment as they continue to try and contain the situation. With three out of the four reactors at varying stages of disintegration it is difficult to predict the outcome. This is already the worst civil nuclear power accident in recorded history - Chernobyl was a military reactor and the Windscale reactor fire in England in 1957 was never properly recorded. The social and economic costs I believe will already exceed Chernobyl given the location of this event close to the heart of the world's third largest economy. There is still ample scope for this event to get considerably worse.
It is very telling that the German government acted yesterday to cancel license extensions for aging reactors even before the containment system of the Fukushima #2 reactor was breached. The nuclear renaissance in the west has always been lukewarm. In the UK for example, pro-nuclear Conservatives are in coalition government with Liberal Democrats who are instinctively anti-nuclear and who had to compromise on this long held policy stance to enter government. The Scottish minority government lead by The Scottish National Party (SNP) has adopted a no nuclear policy that is supported by Liberal Democrats and The Greens. The Conservatives alone are pro-nuclear with Scottish Labour hedging their bets on territory between the anti and pro camp. Most democracies will have tenuous alliances such as this and I think it is safe to now say that the nuclear renaissance is stone dead. I would anticipate a mass of safety audits to ensue with accelerated closure of aging nuclear plants and cancellation of plans to build new. A quick look at the stock prices of uranium miners and nuclear plant builders suggests I am not alone in holding this view.
OECD politicians believe their pro-nuclear stance was driven by a need to reduce CO2 emissions and still seem to be sublimely unaware that the real driving force is to replace supplies of cheap natural gas and coal that are likely now to become even more scarce on the international markets as countries scramble to replace lost nuclear capacity. German Chancellor Angela Merkel is reported as saying:
"Merkel added that she was not worried about Germany's electricity supply as the country was a net exporter of energy."
Presumably what is meant is a net exporter of electricity. What will become of countries dependent upon these German electricity exports?
It is time for cool heads in the OECD but, unfortunately with the energy debate driven by emotion, this will not happen. Decisions made now in the wake of an emergency in Japan may sow the seed of energy poverty in countries like the UK for decades to come. I have for a long while been pro-nuclear but must admit that my faith in nuclear planners is shaken by this sequence of events. Now is not the time for knee-jerk decisions. Governments must carefully weigh the benefits of stable supplies of nuclear electricity to society against the risks posed by nuclear power plants. This is not an easy task.
ABOUT THE MARCH 2017 SALON & WALKING TOUR:
Making Sense of Parker Center
This edition of the LAVA Sunday Salon and Broadway on My Wind walking tour looks at the Police Facilities Building (Welton Becket & Associates and J. E. Stanton, 1955). Better known as Parker Center or The Glass House, this downtown landmark is facing an uncertain future as the city seeks to demolish and the Cultural Heritage Commission, Los Angeles Conservancy and preservationists urge adaptive reuse.
Join Esotouric's Richard Schave, architect & historian Alan Hess and 2015 LAVA Visionary of the Year Nathan Marsak for a slide show presentation followed by a site visit about the building's history within LAPD and the Little Tokyo neighborhood, its place in Welton Becket's architectural legacy and its role in the Los Angeles school of mid-century Modernism. We'll also look at the threat to its survival and efforts to preserve the building and its integrated sculpture, mosaics and landscaping.
ABOUT THE SALON: On the last Sunday of the month starting at 2pm, LAVA welcomes interested individuals to gather in downtown Los Angeles for the Sunday Salon, featuring a presentation by a LAVA Visionary and opportunities to meet and connect with one another.

There is nothing like telling a story using music. When the Critical Role gang asked us guests to come up with a playlist that helped highlight the history of our characters, I jumped at the chance. I love music, I love storytelling and I love fantasy. Combining all three…? Yeah, that's a wonderful night for me. So I am honored to give you the Kashaw Vesh Playlist. Depressing? Sure, at first but…it's a ride. From birth to meeting and falling in love with Zahra, thanks for joining me on this journey! (but I didn't use Journey)
-Will Friedle
Will Friedle — Kashaw Vesh: What Are You Looking At?
Speak To Me/Breathe (In The Air) – Pink Floyd
A tiny, nameless, village. A family he will never know. Kashaw is born.
Witchy Woman – Eagles
Swaddled in gold and whisked away by The Guide, Kashaw is raised to marry and sit at the right hand of the goddess VESH. While he is taught healing, weapons, and tactics, his main focus of study is on his new patron deity. How bad could she be?
Crawling – Linkin Park
On his 15th naming day, VESH appears and consummates their marriage. During the ritual known as the BIND'ACH MAANO', Kashaw is given a glimpse into the soul of his blushing new bride. It isn't pretty.
One – Metallica
Waking and finding VESH gone and the Guide and Brothers dead, Kashaw must seek his path in life. Being trained to fight and heal he has but one option,…to become a soldier. After surviving his first battle he is called on to heal the most seriously wounded. The devastation sears his soul.
On The Turning Away – Pink Floyd
Kashaw is at a crossroads. While VESH is gone, the pull towards the blackness of life is incredibly strong. He has to make a decision…lose himself in the abyss of the world or focus on using his powers to make it a better place. Which path would you choose?
The Girl Who Lives On Heaven Hill – Husker Du
After spending some time learning how to be a person, Kash makes some good decisions…and some bad ones. One of the bad ones ends with him owing some people. The people… ? The Slayers Take. There he sees a girl who makes him think things he shouldn't. Better be a dick to her so she doesn't notice. This one's for you Keyleth.
Brothers In Arms – Dire Straits
Kash decides to leave the Slayer's Take and strike out on his own again. Even though he is used to walking the lonely path, he can't stop thinking about the bond the members of Vox Machina share. Maybe he needs to find a family of his own.
See A Little Light – Bob Mould
Life is starting to get a little better for Kash. If only he could meet someone…
Send Me An Angel – Real Life
Kash meets the love of his life. The one who teaches him that it's okay to love and trust again. And what better way to show Kash's love for Zahra then with an 80's love ballad! Hell yeah!
I Feel Free – Cream
For the first time in his life, the future looks bright (though he'll never let you know it). Vesh is gone and he is by Zahra's side. What a way to live.

Five questions for Alabama's defensive line in advance of fall camp.
5 .] Can Josh Frazier provide some snaps? With Jarran Reed and A'Shawn Robinson no longer around, the path has been cleared for Frazier to contend for playing time behind Alabama's projected starters. Other than Daron Payne, there aren't many true nose tackle types on the roster, so the 6-foot-4, 315-pound Frazier should be in the mix from a depth standpoint. In hindsight, a redshirt year in 2014 might have been best for the Arkansas native, who has appeared in 12 games the last two seasons. Now at the midway point of his eligibility, it's time for Frazier -- a top 40 national prospect coming out of high school -- to make his case for a role that consists of more than mop-up time snaps. 4.] Who will benefit the most from double teams?
Over the last year, I've highlighted via video some of Jonathan Allen's devastating work against offensive guards in one-on-one matchups. If we know it, you best believe opposing offensive coordinators are well aware of what Allen is capable of doing in those situations. So, after benefiting from them himself the last few seasons, Allen can expect to see considerably more doubles in 2016. With that expectation in mind, Da'Shawn Hand and Dalvin Tomlinson are good bets to see their quarterback pressure numbers increase this season -- with an emphasis on Hand, who had three sacks in limited playing time a season ago. Considering that he'll be on the field with Allen in some nickel situations, I'll even include Payne in that group.
3.] How quickly will the newcomers get up to speed?
Even with Kendall Jones coming up short of qualifying standards, still a promising ground of newcomers in end Quinnen Williams, tackle Raekwon Davis and junior college transfer end Jamar King. With depth a bit of a question mark beyond Alabama's top four linemen, the incoming trio represents the first major challenge for new defensive line coach Karl Dunbar. It would be nice if Williams and Davis were allowed to come along at a reasonable pace, but circumstances might dictate that their development be expedited. And while King will serve as the elder statesman of not only the newcomers, but the position in general, he hasn't had the benefit of a run through spring drills or summer workouts in Tuscaloosa. UA knows what it has in Allen, Hand, Payne and Tomlinson. The emphasis in camp will be on finding out what the new guys can offer.
2.] Who wins the end job opposite Allen: Tomlinson or Hand?
Due in large part to the big plays he's made as a situational performer the last two seasons, Hand is a popular pick among some fans and media. I'd be cautious about placing flash ahead of down-in and down-out dependability, however. Not that Hand won't prove capable of providing more than pass rush, but we know Tomlinson can get it done on first down against big boy offenses. And it's not like Tomlinson hasn't been involved in Alabama's pass rush packages in the past. We saw him last year in the nickel and dime packages. Looking ahead to this season, both players are going to be counted on to provide starter-like snaps and there's a good chance we'll see them on the field together at times. In other words, Alabama really has three starting defensive ends instead of two.
1.] Can Payne stay healthy?
Is it farfetched to think Payne might be the most important lineman of the bunch? I don't think so. No one is questioning that Allen is the star of the group heading into the season. But in terms of how much an injury would negatively impact the Alabama defense, Payne's value is greater than any other guy up front. Why? First and foremost, Payne is the anchor UA has to have against offenses that rely on getting the job done on the ground. Not only that, he's capable of providing some interior pass rush while staying on the field in Alabama's "big nickel" look. Basically, the Crimson Tide had three players who fit that mold in 2015. It heads into 2016 with just one: Payne.
Demonstrators in France, Greece, Turkey, Egypt, Germany and Iraq were among those protesting on a range of issues
Hundreds of thousands of people in countries across the world have taken part in global street protests to mark May Day.
Demonstrators in France, Greece, Turkey, Egypt, Germany and Iraq were among those protesting on a range of issues including unemployment, women's rights and immigration.
In France up to 120,000 people turned out for marches in 200 locations. The protesters voiced anger over high unemployment - measured at 9.6% - and job cuts in the public sector, while showing support for popular uprising across the Arab world.
In Greece unions said around 12,000 workers took to the streets in central Athens. Cuts in public sector pay and pensions along with higher taxes were the main focus of protests.
Unemployment in Greece has also climbed to a record high of 15.1%. After the rallies there were minor scuffles between police and a small group of self-proclaimed anarchists in the bohemian district of Exarhia in central Athens.
In Turkey, thousands of union members and leftist political activists gathered in Istanbul's Taksim Square for a second year of May Day celebrations.
The May Day rallies had been banned in Taksim Square from when army generals swept into power in 1980 up until last year.
Meanwhile in Iraq, hundreds of people, many of them members of the Iraqi Communist Party, demonstrated in the capital Baghdad to press for more jobs and equal labour rights for women. Thousands of Iraqis, inspired by uprisings elsewhere in the Arab region, have taken to the streets in recent months to press for better basic services and an end to corruption.
Demonstrators, many carrying red flags associated with Iraq's communist party, marched peacefully in Baghdad's central Firdous Square, chanting: "First of May is the day for workers."
In Europe, around 10,000 demonstrators, flanked by a heavy police presence, took to the streets for the "Revolutionary May Day" demonstrations in the German capital, Berlin. There were a number of violent scuffles, with protestors throwing bottles and fireworks at police in Berlin's Kreuzberg district, where the May Day activities traditionally take place. Along the demonstration route protestors destroyed the window of a bank and a bus station.
In Moscow, around 500 nationalists rallied in the centre of the city to protest against their government's financial support of the impoverished regions that make up Russia's north caucasus. Donning surgical face masks, bands of young people marched peacefully down Moscow's multi-laned streets with large red and black banners reading "Russia for Russians!" and "Migrant workers get out!"".
Brendon McCullum will retire from international cricket next month © Getty Images
Brendon McCullum, New Zealand's captain who is set to retire from international cricket next month, will give the annual MCC Spirit of Cricket lecture at Lord's in June.
McCullum has been widely praised for the way his side have played the game since he took charge at the start of 2013. An emphasis on team spirit, enjoyment and fairness coincided with one of the most successful periods in New Zealand's history and saw the team feted at home - where rugby usually dominates - and around the world during their run to the 2015 World Cup final.
The MCC Spirit of Cricket lecture was first delivered by Richie Benaud in 2001, with notable speakers including Desmond Tutu, Imran Khan, Kumar Sangakkara and Ian Botham. McCullum will become second New Zealander to deliver the address, after Martin Crowe in 2006.
The MCC has also announced that McCullum will join its World Cricket Committee - a think tank that examines issues affecting the game, from the development of pink balls to Olympic participation - from October.
"It was an honour to be asked to deliver the MCC Spirit of Cricket Cowdrey lecture - especially given the stature of some previous speakers - so I was very pleased to accept the invitation," McCullum said. "There are a number of important issues in world cricket at the moment that I am looking forward to addressing, and I hope it is an interesting evening for everyone watching. I'm also very pleased to be joining the World Cricket committee in October and being given the chance to discuss and have an impact on world cricket."
McCullum was handed the New Zealand captaincy in difficult circumstances, with his predecessor, Ross Taylor, unhappy at the way he was removed from the job. Taylor opted out of the subsequent tour of South Africa but, after two innings defeats - New Zealand were bowled out for 45 in Cape Town - McCullum quickly turned the team around, presiding over a two-year unbeaten run in Tests that was ended by Australia in December.
His attacking style of captaincy was epitomised by continuing to stack men in the slips during ODIs and New Zealand were many neutrals' favourites after reaching their first World Cup final - though they were heavily beaten by Australia at the MCG.
In 2014, McCullum became the first New Zealander to score a Test triple-hundred, against India in Wellington, and last month he drew level with Adam Gilchrist as the only batsmen to hit 100 sixes in Tests. McCullum will sign off his 14-year international career with three ODIs and two Tests against Australia in February.
MCC president Roger Knight said: "Brendon McCullum is one of the best cricketers of his generation and I'm sure will be a very engaging speaker, especially given his insight in to the modern game. He has embodied the play hard, play fair message of the MCC Spirit of Cricket throughout his playing career, especially in his captaincy, so is a perfect fit for this event.
"We are delighted that MCC's relationship with Brendon will continue after the lecture when he joins our World Cricket committee in October, and I've no doubt his experience will be a valuable asset to the group."
After the Spirit of Cricket lecture, which will take place on June 6, McCullum will join a panel of players for a question-and-answer session that will discuss topics arising from his speech and other issues affecting the game.

UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - Jordan formally submitted to the United Nations Security Council on Wednesday a draft resolution calling for peace between Israel and the Palestinians within one year and an end to Israel's occupation of Palestinian territories by the end of 2017.
The Palestinian-drafted resolution was formally submitted to the 15-member council, which means it could be put to a vote as soon as 24 hours later, but it does not guarantee it will happen. Some drafts formally submitted have never been voted.
Diplomats say negotiations on the text could take days or weeks. Jordan's U.N. envoy Dina Kawar said she hoped the council could reach a unanimous decision on the resolution.
An earlier Palestinian draft informally circulated to the council in October called for an end to Israeli occupation of Palestinian territory by November 2016, but the United States and others found this text unacceptable.
Nine votes are needed to adopt a resolution, which would then force the United States, a close ally of Israel, to decide whether to veto it. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said on Tuesday the United States had made “no determinations about language, approaches, specific resolutions, any of that.”
France, Britain and Germany are also drafting a resolution, which French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius said would propose concluding peace talks in two years. Other parameters for ending the conflict would also be set, diplomats said. The submitted Palestinian draft appears to reflect some European ideas.
Palestinians seek statehood in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and blockaded Gaza Strip, with East Jerusalem as their capital - lands captured by Israel in a 1967 war.
The draft resolution submitted on Wednesday states that a negotiated solution should be based on several parameters including the 1967 borders, security agreements, and “Jerusalem as the shared capital of the two States which fulfills the legitimate aspirations of both parties and protects freedom of worship.”
The text also “calls upon both parties to abstain from any unilateral and illegal actions, including settlement activities, that could undermine the viability of a two-state solution.”
Israel accepts the “two-state solution” of an independent and democratic Palestinian state alongside Israel, but has not accepted the 1967 borders as the basis for final negotiations, citing security and other concerns.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Monday that he had sought reassurances from Kerry that Washington would block efforts to adopt U.N. Security Council resolution.
(CNN) For a second day, North Korea appeared to be flexing its military muscles in the wake of a United Nations vote meant to cripple the nation's nuclear program.
North Korean leader Kim Jong-un said the country's "nuclear warheads need to be ready for use at any time," the North Korean state news agency KCNA reported Friday.
"Under the extreme situation that the U.S. Imperialist is misusing its military influence and is pressuring other countries and people to start war and catastrophe, the only way for our people to protect sovereignty and rights to live is to strengthen the quality and quantity of nuclear power and realize the balance of power," Kim said, according to KCNA.
The news agency also confirmed to test-fire of a new multiple launch rocket system. It's unclear whether that event is the same launch by North Korea of "short-range projectiles," announced one day earlier by the South Korean Joint Chiefs of Staff.
"We are aware of the reports. We are closely monitoring the situation on the Korean Peninsula in coordination with our regional allies," the Pentagon said in response to Friday's news. "We urge North Korea to refrain from provocative actions that aggravate tensions and instead focus on fulfilling its international obligations and commitments."
'A lot of bluster'
North Korea is believed to have an untested capability when it comes to nuclear weapons. As one U.S. official told CNN's Barbara Starr, the regime has tested nuclear devices that it says have been miniaturized.
The attitude of U.S. officials is that they consider North Korea's claim true because they can't risk underestimating it, but the claim is not verified.
North Korea has also tested long-range missiles but not completely. It has not tested missile re-entry, for example. Additionally, North Korea has not married a nuclear device with a long-range missile, and the United States does not know whether North Korea would do so without testing first.
"The threat here is, to me right now, it's a lot of bluster," said Philip Yun, executive director of the Ploughshares Fund, a group that advocates nuclear disarmament. "For them to deliver on a threat, they have to have intent and they have to have capability. And quite frankly, I don't think they have both."
Yun told CNN the purpose of the news might be internal.
"Kim Jong-un has got a large party congress that's going to be happening in May. And this is all about, for him, again, additional consolidation of power. He'll want to get rid and justify getting rid of any enemies he may have.
"And this is part of a process where he is able to ratchet up the pressure, increase his control internally, and brandish his credentials to be 'protecting the motherland.' And so all of this sort of helps him internally even though it may not ring true to many of us here outside," he said.
Yun stressed that he does not think the North Koreans are suicidal: "They know that if they did a pre-emptive attack or used nuclear weapons, they would cease to exist."
Fresh sanctions
Earlier this week, the U.N. Security Council voted to impose an array of sanctions against North Korea because of that nation's recent nuclear test and missile launch, both of which defied international sanctions.
The U.N. resolution that brought about the sanctions aims to cripple the economic factors that fuel North Korea's nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
The North Korean state news agency blasted the sanctions as "unprecedented and gangster-like."
The "political and economic pressure and military aggression on the DPRK have gone to a grave phase that can no longer be overlooked," KCNA said.
China reiterated its opposition on North Korea developing nuclear weapons.
Fu Ying, a spokeswoman for China's Parliament, said it will abide by the Security Council sanctions, but she highlighted the need for six-party talks to resolve the issue.
Hydrogen bomb
Discussions about new sanctions started after North Korea claimed to have successfully tested a hydrogen bomb in January, its fourth nuclear test.
Then, in February, Pyongyang said it had successfully launched an Earth satellite into orbit via the long-range Kwangmyongsong carrier rocket.
According to CNN's Paula Hancocks, Friday's developments are not necessarily new, but they do represent an increase in the tensions that already existed on the Korean Peninsula.
"And, also bear in mind, we're just a couple of days away now from the joint military drills between the United States and South Korea. These happen every year. Washington and Seoul say they're defensive in nature, but every year they irritate Pyongyang," she said.

Herculine Barbin (November 8, 1838– February 1868)[1] was a French intersex person who was determined as female at birth and raised in a convent, but was later reclassified as male by a court of law, after an affair and physical examination.
Early life [ edit ]
Most of what we know about Barbin comes from her later memoirs. Herculine Adélaîde Barbin was born in Saint-Jean-d'Angély in France in 1838. She was assigned as a girl and raised as such; her family referred to her as Alexina. Her family was poor but she gained a charity scholarship to study in the school of an Ursuline convent.
According to her account, she had a crush on an aristocratic female friend in school. She regarded herself as unattractive but sometimes slipped into her friend's room at night and was sometimes punished for that. However, her studies were successful and in 1856, at the age of seventeen she was sent to Le Chateau to study to become a teacher. There she fell in love with one of the teachers.
Puberty [ edit ]
Although Barbin was in puberty, she had not begun to menstruate and remained flat chested. The hairs on her upper lip and cheeks were noticeable.[2]
In 1857 Barbin received a position as an assistant teacher in a girls' school. She fell in love with another teacher, Sara, and Barbin demanded that only she should dress her. Her ministrations turned into caresses and they became lovers. Eventually rumors about their affair began to circulate.
Barbin, although sick her whole life, began to suffer excruciating pains. When a doctor examined her, he was shocked and asked that she should be sent away from the school, but she stayed.
Eventually, the devoutly Catholic Barbin confessed to Jean-François-Anne Landriot, the Bishop of La Rochelle. She asked him permission to break the confessional silence in order to send for a doctor to examine her. When Dr. Chesnet did so in 1860, he discovered that even if Barbin had a small vagina, she had a masculine body type, a very small penis, and testicles inside her body. In 20th-century medical terms, she had "male pseudohermaphroditism".
Reassignment as male [ edit ]
A later legal decision declared official that Barbin was male. She left her lover and her job, changed her name to Abel Barbin and was briefly mentioned in the press. She moved to Paris where she lived in poverty and wrote her memoirs, reputedly as a part of therapy. In the memoirs, Barbin would use female pronouns when writing about her life prior to sexual redesignation and male pronouns, including Alexina and Camille, following the declaration.[3] Nevertheless, she clearly regarded herself as punished, and "disinherited", subject to a "ridiculous inquisition".
In his commentary to Barbin's memoirs, Michel Foucault presented Barbin as an example of the "happy limbo of a non-identity", but whose masculinity marked her from her contemporaries.[4] Morgan Holmes states that Barbin's own writings showed that she saw herself as an "exceptional female", but female nonetheless.[4]
Death [ edit ]
In February 1868, the concierge of Barbin's house in rue de l'École-de-Médecine found her dead in her home. She had committed suicide by inhaling gas from her coal gas stove. Her memoirs were found beside her bed.
Memoirs publication [ edit ]
Title page of Ambroise Tardieu's 1872 book in which excerpts of Herculine Barbin's memoirs were first published.
Dr. Regnier reported the death, recovered the memoirs and performed an autopsy. Later he gave the memoirs to Auguste Ambroise Tardieu, who published excerpts as "Histoire et souvenirs d'Alexina B." ("The Story and Memoirs of Alexina B.") in his book Question médico-légale de l'identité dans ses rapport avec les vices de conformation des organes sexuels, contenant les souvenirs et impressions d'un individu dont le sexe avait été méconnu ("Forensics of Identity Involving Deformities of the Sexual Organs, Along With the Memoirs and Impressions of an Individual Whose Sex Was Misidentified") (Paris: J.-B. Ballière et Fils, 1872). The excerpts were translated to English in 1980.
Michel Foucault discovered the memoirs in the 1970s while conducting research at the French Department of Public Hygiene. He had the journals republished as Herculine Barbin: Being the Recently Discovered Memoirs of a Nineteenth-century French Hermaphrodite. In his edition, Foucault also included a set of medical reports, legal documents, and newspaper articles, as well as a short story adaptation by Oscar Panizza.
According to Morgan Holmes, the anthropologist Gilbert Herdt has identified Barbin as providing a crisis for "modern ideology" through an identification as neither male nor female,[5] but Barbin's own writings describe a self-identification as female, albeit an exceptional female.[4]
Barbin's memoirs inspired the French film The Mystery of Alexina. and Jeffrey Eugenides in his book Middlesex treats concurrent themes, as does Virginia Woolf in her book, Orlando: A Biography. Judith Butler refers to Foucault's commentary on Barbin at various points in her 1990 Gender Trouble, including her chapter "Foucault, Herculine, and the Politics of Sexual Discontinuity."
Barbin appears as a character in the play A Mouthful of Birds by Caryl Churchill and David Lan. Barbin also appears as a character in the play Hidden: A Gender by Kate Bornstein. Herculine, a full-length play based on the memoirs of Barbin, is by Garrett Heater. Kira Obolensky also wrote a two-act stage adaptation entitled The Adventures of Herculina.
In 2014, a manuscript entitled Dear Herculine by Aaron Apps won the 2014 Sawtooth Poetry Prize from Ahsahta Press.[6]
Commemoration [ edit ]
The birthday of Herculine Barbin is marked in Intersex Day of Remembrance on 8 November.

Encryption is important, but you should know the dangers of using encryption software that cannot be closely examined — and how to mitigate those dangers when you have no choice but to use it.
A basic understanding of the practical realities of privacy technologies should include an understanding of why encryption that doesn't trust the user isn't trustworthy. There are times, however, that we must make do with less than ideal choices for security software. One such example is that of performing secure file transfers on a wireless network with an Android smartphone. Because the Android OS does not offer users an instance of OpenSSH as part of the standard system, and because there is not an open source SSH-based file transfer client or server application in the Android Market, the common choices are to either use a closed source tool or not use SSH on an Android device for file transfers at all.
The problem is not limited to SSH software. Any closed source software involved in the process can be a problem, from the operating system on which the SSH software is running, through password managers and any special "multimedia key" management applications for keyboards, all the way to the encryption software itself. As long as such closed source software ties into key parts of the trusted chain of operations, there is little that can be done to ensure that what should be private remains private.
Of course, open source software provides no 100% guarantees. Its benefits merely revolve around a much greater chance that any data leaks or malicious software designs are more likely to be caught, especially given that — unlike the case of closed source software — open source development is not typically performed by a set of employees operating under nondisclosure agreements. A community of people with equal access to the source code, many of them operating independently and some even with strong motivations to discover and publicly reveal vulnerabilities, makes for a very difficult place to hide malicious security compromises in your code.
On the other hand, in many cases the biggest privacy concern is not the data you wish to transfer from one system to another. In such circumstances, perhaps the potential for someone to read the data you transfer from one system to another based on unencrypted data leaks and backdoors do not concern you much. While it is generally better to securely encrypt all data on the off-chance malicious use can be made of it outside the expectations of the person transferring files from one system to another, the simple necessity of transferring files may override "just in case" measures that are most likely unnecessary.
The matter of secure authentication is still important, however. When transferring files, the very act of authentication on the remote system required to gain access for a file transfer operation can make the target system vulnerable. If the software used to establish the connection leaks data somehow, the authentication information itself could be compromised — and could subsequently be used to gain unauthorized access to the remote system.
While trying to cover up these dangers with masking tape is an imperfect response, imperfection is sometimes better than nothing at all. In that spirit, some measures can be taken to mitigate that danger:
Never transfer files one would not trust in the hands of a stranger, including the developers of the closed source software you use. Set up a secure file transfer account with rssh so that compromise of the account will not provide direct shell access to the system. Use the find utility to scan for writable directories on a regular basis, to ensure that if unauthorized access is achieved the account used to access the system will not have the correct permissions to affect other parts of the system. Set secure file permission defaults, again to employ the system's privilege separation capabilities to limit the effects of unauthorized access to the system. Use integrity auditing frequently to ensure the system has not been compromised.
Some of these measures are just smart security practice, but they become especially important for the case of using SSH via untrusted tools such as a closed source SSH client when connecting to the system. Additional options are available as well, including one-time passwords. Another measure can be taken that may be the most effective of all such mitigations — but also the most onerous — and thus deserves special mention:
Creating a special user account just for the purpose of making file transfers, moving files out of that account so they will not be vulnerable to unauthorized access, and replacing the account with a new one with a new password on a regular basis, helps eliminate opportunity for even compromised authentication data to be used maliciously. This approach may prove impractical, because the administrative overhead involved in taking such steps becomes prohibitive in a hurry when such file transfers are performed frequently or when many such accounts need to be maintained in parallel.
Obviously, the best option is to avoid using closed source encryption and privacy software altogether. If that is not a reasonable option, however, any measures that can reasonably be taken to mitigate the danger of trusting software distributed by people who do not trust the users should be taken.
In some cases, avoiding use of the network altogether is the only reasonable way to mitigate the danger of file transfers. Unfortunately, using common portable storage devices to transfer files — such as USB flash storage media — is a solution that has its own problems.

Dear Coleen
For a while when I was a teenager I had a gay relationship, but he left without saying a word, which was devastating as I loved him dearly. So on Saturdays, I started going swimming and had a coffee afterwards, hoping someone would pick me up.
I have a sister who's a bit younger than me and one Saturday she asked to come with me as our mum was working. We argued in the pool and when we got home she grabbed an expensive pen I was writing with, so we ended up fighting on her bed.
I don't know why – I couldn't help it I suppose – but I kissed her and she kissed me back and we ended up making love. Since that day, everything changed and we became lovers. I actually became addicted to her.
We are now a couple and go swimming together, on walks and I even take her dancing.
I know this is all wrong, but we've had a serious conversation and we have decided to live together as a couple. I don't know what you can do for us or even why I'm writing, but we're deeply in love and now I have no need for a gay relationship.
I'd like your opinion please.
Coleen says
I think you're writing to me because you know what you're doing is wrong and, of course, illegal, but you're hoping someone will give you some kind of miracle answer that makes it OK. Well, I can't do that.
I think you should have counselling because you might be able to unravel why you ended up together and work out strategies to help you move on.
Perhaps it's covering up lots other issues. It's almost as if you're saying the relationship stopped you being gay. Maybe a close sexual relationship is just safer with her.
If you don't end this now with your sister, where does it leave you? You'll be living an illegal life, hiding your true relationship from everyone, and never feeling free or truly happy.
Also, if you live in a relatively small community, it might not be easy to keep this a secret.
While you're making out that you're happy, I don't think you are deep down or you wouldn't be writing to me.
Inside it does trouble you and you know it's wrong. Don't put yourself in a situation that's hard to escape from by moving in together and, instead, take steps to find a counsellor who can help you resolve this.

Image caption Massive overfishing has depleted stocks in European waters
Campaigners have welcomed an EU decision that looks likely to preserve fish stocks and support the owners of small fishing boats in coastal ports.
They say the fisheries deal between ministers and the European Parliament is good for fish and fishermen.
It is the latest step in marathon negotiations to reform the controversial Common Fisheries Policy.
Fishing groups are urging politicians to ensure that the reformed CFP rules allow them to stay in business.
The decision is a compromise between the European Parliament, which wants radical reform, and the Council, where member states led by Spain and France are trying to protect industrial fishing.
The final wording of the package has not yet been agreed and the full parliament plans to hold a vote on it in June or July.
Campaigners say the result is largely a victory for reform. It will allow nations to reallocate fish quotas from large operators to small, in a drive to reduce the damage caused by overfishing.
Simon Clydesdale from the environmental group Greenpeace said that “for decades in Europe fishing has been a story of decline, with severe over-exploitation of fish stocks and small-scale fishermen squeezed out of business by a minority of fishing barons.
“For all its loopholes and sluggish timelines the policy agreed last night has the potential to turn Europe's destructive and oversized fishing industry into a sustainable, low-impact sector.”
Crackdown on discards
Another key decision consolidated the broad principle that Europe's fish quotas should be set at a level where stocks can actually recover, instead of just stabilising. This was said by the Council to be a breakthrough, although Tony Long of the campaign group WWF complained: “The majority of Europe's governments decided to stonewall negotiations.”
The meeting confirmed a previous decision to phase out the policy of discarding fish – starting with mackerel and other pelagic species by 2015. Pelagic fish live in the upper layers of the oceans. All fish will be covered by the policy by 2020. Again, there is something of a loophole as a small percentage of fish discards will continue until then.
The next phase is for fisheries to start working on detailed multi-annual plans to ensure that stocks are managed prudently. These should take the place of the annual December Fisheries Council meetings that have led to ministers bidding against each other to raise the quota for domestic fleets.
The UK environment department Defra has welcomed a move to allow regional fisheries to escape micro-management from Brussels.
Fisheries Minister Richard Benyon said the UK "has pressed hard for many years to reform this broken policy so we can fish more sustainably, ban discards and end the one-size-fits-all approach to decision-making.
"It is great news that we are almost there. We hope that we can agree the final deal very soon," he said.
An industry body, the Scottish Fishermen's Federation, is urging the rule-makers to take practical steps to help fishing fleets. Its chief executive Bertie Armstrong said: “Fishing provides a crucial renewable food resource, so it's vital that measures to protect our fishermen are at the heart of the CFP.”
Meanwhile the British celebrity chef and Fish Fight campaigner, Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall, said the CFP reform "doesn't mean the Fish Fight is over, but this is a tremendous achievement which I really believe would not have happened without the help and support of all 860,000 of our Fish Fight supporters".
"The great news is that it will hugely reduce discards across Europe," he said.

AFC Wimbledon have played at Kingsmeadow since their formation in 2002
The owners of AFC Wimbledon, the Dons Trust, have backed plans to sell the club's Kingsmeadow ground to Premier League side Chelsea.
However, the sale is conditional on Wimbledon receiving planning permission to build a new stadium in Merton.
The Dons Trust, formed by Wimbledon fans, held a vote on the proposal on Monday, with 98% in favour of the sale.
Chelsea intend to use the ground, which is also home to non-league Kingstonian, for youth team and women's matches.
The proposed sale to the Blues is now subject to a vote by all shareholders in AFC Wimbledon next month, although approval is expected to be a formality as the Dons Trust controls 90% of shares in the League Two clubs.
"The successful vote on the stadium sale is an important milestone in helping to return AFC Wimbledon to its spiritual home in Merton," said Dons Trust chair Matthew Breach.
"There is still a lot of work to do to deliver a new stadium but the outcome of the vote shows the overwhelming support among the club's fans for having Wimbledon play where it belongs, back in Merton."
AFC Wimbledon have played at Kingsmeadow since their formation in 2002 and bought the lease on the ground from Kingstonian a year later.
However, the Dons have a long-standing ambition to return to Plough Lane, which they see as their spiritual home, and have submitted a planning application to Merton Council to build a new 20,000-capacity stadium on the site of Wimbledon Greyhound Stadium.
Wimbledon say they will pay Kingstonian "a substantial sum of money" to help the K's secure their future at another ground in or around Kingston.

IPv6 is the cure for the looming shortage of Internet addresses, but the complexity of the migration is making it tough medicine.
Everything from conventional computing devices to objects with sensors and actuators is using the Internet to communicate. And developments in fields such as nanotech and biotech promise to create even more Internet traffic. Each device on the Internet has a distinct address and connects using Internet Protocol (IP). IPv4 is the standard widely in use. But it's ancient in terms of Internet time, dating back to the 1970s, and we're rapidly running out of IPv4 addresses. IPv6 is the new standard that's poised to come to the rescue, but adoption has been perilously slow so far.
IPv6 promises to keep everyone and everything connected because the technology allows for so many more addresses. How many more? If the number of addresses supported by IPv4 were one drop of water, the number of addresses supported by IPv6 would amount to the oceans of six earths in comparison. That's the good news.
The bad news is that even though the growth of IP traffic is accelerating, fewer IPv6 addresses were allocated in 2012 than 2011. The even worse news is that regional Internet registries are running out of IPv4 addresses. South and Southeast Asia and Australia have already exhausted the supply, and Europe, the rest of Asia, and the Middle East are about to follow suit. North America is expected to exhaust its supply of IPv4 addresses by the middle of next year. In all regions, the percentage of networks announcing an IPv6 prefix represents just a slice of a much larger pie.
Why is adoption so slow? Enterprises need to first locate IPv4 addresses in network hardware, devices, and the application stack before they can even begin the migration process. In addition to converting thousands of devices and codes, a medium to large enterprise would need to convert firewalls, routers, and scores of distribution switches.
The following infographic provides an overview of the need for action and why it will be so complex and time-consuming.

I don't believe they should be punished for creative expression because of a loosely worded bylaw. - Lydia Greenly, burlesque supporter
Right now, burlesque shows fall between the cracks of Hamilton's licensing bylaw, resulting in the city laying fines on two dancers last year. Now officials are looking at how to update the city bylaw to fix that.
Burlesque is an art form where dancers perform strip teases — but with an emphasis on the tease. Pasties or tassels to cover their nipples. They wear g-strings and use feathers and glitter.
At Ten Decades — the club where two dancers were fined last August — it had a New Orleans speakeasy-prohibition vibe.
Burlesque is theatrical and promotes positive body image, said Lydia Greenly, a Hamilton resident who encouraged the review at Tuesday's city council planning committee meeting.
A burlesque dancer named Kayla Kunkel was charged by city bylaw after performing a routine at Ten Decades club in Hess Village. (Ruth Gillson)
"Burlesque helped me through some dark times with self confidence and body image," said Greenly, who used to be a burlesque dancer. "I'm very grateful for the art form."
I don't view it as adult entertainment. I view it as theatre. - Matthew Green, city councillor
The dancers fighting the fines in court "are being persecuted," she said.
"I don't believe they should be punished for creative expression because of a loosely worded bylaw."
Right now, Hamilton's bylaw only references "adult entertainment." It prohibits "adult services appealing to or designed to appeal to erotic or sexual appetites or inclinations."
That includes entertainment advertised as "sexy," and services featuring "nudity or partial nudity." That led to the two women being ticketed last summer.
There's no doubt our bylaws are antiquated. - Ken Leendertse, director of licensing
Matthew Green, Ward 3 councillor, pushed for the review on Tuesday.
"I don't view it as adult entertainment," he said of burlesque. "I view it as theatre."
Ken Leendertse, the city's director of licensing, expects to report back this year. "We'll look at proper definitions and see what other municipalities have done."
It's always helpful to update a bylaw, he said.
"There's no doubt our bylaws are antiquated. They were written many, many years ago."
City council will vote on Jan. 25 whether to ratify the review.

Last week, the European Commission voted to place a two-year moratorium on most uses of neonicotinoid pesticides, on the suspicion that they're contributing to the global crisis in honeybee health (a topic I've touched on here, here, here, and here). Since then, several people have asked me whether Europe's move might inspire the US Environmental Protection Agency to make a similar move—currently, neonics are widely used in several of our most prevalent crops, including corn, soy, cotton, and wheat.
The answer is no. As I reported recently, an agency press officer told me the EU move will have no bearing on the EPA's own reviews of the pesticides, which aren't scheduled for release until 2016 at the earliest.
All of which got me thinking about other food-related substances and practices that are banned in Europe but green-lighted here. Turns out there are lots. Aren't you glad you don't live under the Old World regulatory jackboot, where the authorities deny people's freedom to quaff atrazine-laced drinking water, etc., etc.? Let me know in comments if I'm missing any.
1. Atrazine
Why it's a problem: A “potent endocrine disruptor,” Syngenta's popular corn herbicide has been linked to a range of reproductive problems at extremely low doses in both amphibians and humans, and it commonly leaches out of farm fields and into people's drinking water.
What Europe did: Banned it in 2003.
US status: EPA: “Atrazine will begin registration review, EPA's periodic reevaluation program for existing pesticides, in mid-2013.”
2. Arsenic in chicken, turkey, and pig feed
Why it's a problem: Arsenic is beloved of industrial-scale livestock producers because it makes animals grow faster and turns their meat a rosy pink. It enters feed in organic form, which isn't harmful to humans. Trouble is, in animals guts, it quickly goes inorganic, and thus becomes poisonous. Several studies, including one by the FDA, have found heightened levels of inorganic arsenic in supermarket chicken, and it also ends up in manure, where it can move into tap water. Fertilizing rice fields with arsenic-laced manure may be partially responsible for heightened arsenic levels in US rice.
What Europe did: According to the Institute for Agriculture and Trade Policy, arsenic-based compounds “were never approved as safe for animal feed in the European Union, Japan, and many other countries.”
US status: The drug giant Pfizer “voluntarily” stopped marketing the arsenical feed additive Roxarsone back in 2011. But there are still several arsenicals on the market. On May 1, a coalition of enviro groups including the Center for Food Safety, the Institute for Agriculture and Trade Policy, and the Center for Biological Diversity filed a lawsuit demanding that the FDA ban them from feed.
3. “Poultry litter” in cow feed
Why it's a problem: You know how arsenic goes inorganic—and thus poisonous—in chickens' guts? Consider that their arsenic-laced manure is then commonly used as a feed for cows. According to Consumers Union, the stuff “consists primarily of manure, feathers, spilled feed, and bedding material that accumulate on the floors of the buildings that house chickens and turkeys.” The “spilled feed” part is of special concern, because chickens are often fed “meat and bone meal from dead cattle,” CU reported, and that stuff can spill into the litter and be fed back to cows, raising mad cow disease concerns.
What Europe did: Banned all forms of animal protein, including chicken litter, in cow feed in 2001.
US status: The practice remains unrestricted. US cattle consume about 2 billion pounds of it annually, Consumers Union's Michael Hansen told me last year.
4. Chlorine washes for poultry carcasses
Why it's a problem: As the US chicken industry has sped up kill lines in recent years, it has resorted to heavier use of chlorine-based washes to “decrease microbial loads on carcasses,” the Washington Post recently reported, quoting a previously unreleased USDA document. As I've noted, the USDA is preparing to release new rules that would speed up kill lines still more as well as allow companies to douse every carcass that comes down the line with antimicrobial sprays, “whether they are contaminated or not.” According to the Post, poultry workers face a “range of ailments” to the practice, including “asthma and other severe respiratory problems, burns, rashes, irritated eyes, and sinus ulcers and other sinus problems.”
What Europe did: The EU not only bans the practice, but refuses to accept US poultry that has been treated with antimicrobial sprays.
US status: As stated above, the USDA is preparing to roll out new rules that will increase the practice.
5. Antibiotics as growth promoters on livestock farms
Why they're a problem: Antibiotic use has surged on US animal farms in recent years—and now accounts for 80 percent of all antibiotic use. Meanwhile, meat sold in US supermarkets is rife with antibiotic-resistant bacteria.
What Europe did: In the EU, all antibiotics used in human medicines are banned on farms—and no antibiotics can be used on farms for “nonmedical purposes,” i.e., growth promotion.
US status: The FDA is floating new rules that would ban antibiotics as growth promoters—but the regulation would be voluntary.
6. Ractopomine and other pharmaceutical growth enhancers in animal feed
Why it's a problem: Fed to an estimated 60 to 80 percent of US hogs, ractopomine makes animals grow fast while also staying lean. Unfortunately, it does so by mimicking stress hormones, making animals miserable. The excellent food safety reporter Helena Bottemiller looked at FDA documents and found that between its introduction in 1999 and 2011, the drug had killed 210,000 pigs—”more than any other animal drug on the market.” Pigs treated with it, she found, suffer from ailments ranging from hyperactivity and trembling to broken limbs and the inability to walk. (Beef cows are fed similar drugs, as are turkeys.) Traces of these pharmaceuticals routinely end up in our meat—and according to Bottemiller, their effects on humans are little-studied.
What Europe did: Europe not only bars its own producers from using ractopamine, it also refuses to allow imports of meat from animals treated with it—as do China and Russia.
US status: Rather than trying to rein in ractopamine use, the Obama administration is actively seeking to force Europe and other nations to accept our ractopamine-treated pork.
7. Gestation crates
Why it's a problem: The sows that breed the hogs confined in US factory farms spend nearly their entire lives stuffed into crates “so small the animals can't even turn around or take more than a step forward or backward,” the Humane Society of the United States reported. An undercover HSUS investigation of a sow facility run by pork giant Smithfield in 2010 found, among other horrors, this:
The animals engaged in stereotypic behaviors such as biting the bars of crates, indicating poor well-being in the extreme confinement conditions. Some had bitten their bars so incessantly that blood from their mouths coated the fronts of their crates. The breeding pigs also suffered injuries from sharp crate protrusions and open pressure sores that developed from their unyielding confinement.
What Europe did: Banned them, effective this year.
US status: Pork giants Smithfield, Cargill, and Hormel have pledged to phase them out; several fast-food chains including McDonald's, Burger King, Wendy's, and Subway have promised to stop buying from suppliers who use the crates; and nine states have banned the practice, HSUS reported. But the practice remains widespread, and as industry flack Rick Berman recently put it, a large swath of the pork industry “has no plans to stop using standard sow housing.”
When it comes to mobile dating apps, Tinder defines the market. The startup, which sees more than 600 million swipes per day from users, pretty much owns its space in North America, but things are different in other parts of the world. Paktor, a Singapore-based company, believes it has the answer for Southeast Asia, and it has just announced a $3 million-plus funding round to build out its vision for mobile dating.
The Tinder and Paktor apps may be similar from a side-by-side comparison, but Paktor CEO and co-founder Joseph Phua told me that his real battle is to convince (the many socially conservative and traditional) Asians of the benefits of dating apps and service. In that respect, Tinder is more of a help than a hinderance.
“Other apps like Tinder can help to break the connotation that dating is a purely offline experience,” he said. “The publicity and visibility [from other apps] can help us move on from early adopters and reach those who aren't using any dating apps at all.”
Tinder hasn't done any sustained marketing in Asia, and if it were to Phua believes it would likely target China, Korea and Japan, three markets that have robust mobile app ecosystems. Southeast Asia may have 600 million people, but the fragmented nature of the region makes it tougher and less appealing for international companies, he believes.
Plus, Phua said that it's expats and others who follow international news and culture who are more likely to gravitate towards Tinder, rather than true ‘locals' — that's a fair point.
10 Million Swipes Per Day
Paktor's dating app for iOS and Android has 1.5 million registered users, 60 percent of whom are aged 18-24, with over 40 million matches made to date. The company said its network is particularly strong in Singapore, Thailand, Malaysia and Taiwan — it has a physical presence in each of those four countries. While it did not reveal active user numbers, Paktor said it sees 10 million swipes from users each day.
Phua, who started the company with friends Ng Jing Shen (CTO) and Charlene Koh (CMO) in July 2013 after being dumped (he's now happily taken, thanks to a Paktor match, of course), revealed that the funding will go towards a more sustained marketing push in other parts of Southeast Asia.
“We are not limited to Southeast Asia, but it is our focus for now,” he said, when asked whether China, Japan, Korea or other countries in Asia are in the grand plans.
Wider Marketing Efforts And A Desktop Version
The undisclosed round was led by Vertex Venture — a subsidiary of Singapore's Temasek Holdings, which has invested in Uber-rival Grabtaxi. Phua did not reveal specifics, including the valuation, but he did say that it takes Paktor to $5 million in funding to date. The round itself is in excess of $3 million, since Paktor previously closed a $500,000 round and an earlier $1.3 million seed round.
For now, Paktor isn't “switching on the monetization tap,” as Phua phrased it, but it approaches its business in a different way to Tinder, which is actually preparing to introduce subscription services for its app.
Phua said subscription-led services could be introduced in the future, but Paktor is making a platform play with a second offline service that offers more specialist one-on-one matching and “social dating services.” That service (which is not an app) debuted in Singapore this summer, where it is called Gai Gai (‘going out' in local slang), and the funding will go towards launching differentiated versions in Paktor's four largest markets over the next year.
There is also now a web-based version of Paktor which the company believes is important for increasing engagement, particularly in markets where mobile connectivity can be problematic. (Read almost anywhere in Southeast Asia.)
The money raised will also be channeled into making the desktop site more feature-rich and useful for users, but mobile remains the key medium.
“Everything has gone mobile in Asia, it impacts every part of your life,” Phua told me. “And there's no reason that dating shouldn't be the same.”

In July 1915, the American ambassador to the Ottoman Empire sent Washington a harrowing report about the Turks' “systematic attempt to uproot peaceful Armenian populations.” He described “terrible tortures, wholesale expulsions and deportations from one end of the Empire to the other accompanied by frequent instances of rape, pillage and murder, turning into massacre.” A month later, the ambassador, Henry Morgenthau — the grandfather of the Manhattan district attorney, Robert M. Morgenthau — warned of an “attempt to exterminate a race.”
The Young Turk nationalist campaign against the empire's Armenian subjects was far too enormous to be ignored at the time. But decades of government-backed denial have created what amounts to a taboo in Turkey today. Instead of admitting genocide, Turkish officials contend the Armenians were a dangerous fifth column that colluded with Russia in World War I; many Armenians may have died, they say, but there was no organized slaughter. Turkish writers who challenge this line, like the novelists Orhan Pamuk and Elif Shafak, have risked prosecution for insulting Turkish identity. And on the diplomatic front, when Turkey should be polishing its credentials for eventual European Union membership, it is mired in historical fights; this May, for instance, it pulled out of a NATO military exercise to protest the Canadian prime minister's acknowledgment of the genocide.
“A Shameful Act: The Armenian Genocide and the Question of Turkish Responsibility,” by Taner Akcam, is a Turkish blast against this national denial. A historian and former leftist activist now teaching at the Center for Holocaust and Genocide Studies at the University of Minnesota, Akcam is often described as the first Turkish scholar to call the massacres genocide, and his impressive achievement here is to shine fresh light on exactly why and how the Ottoman Empire deported and slaughtered the Armenians. He directly challenges the doubters back home, basing his powerful book on Turkish sources in the old Ottoman script — including the failed Ottoman war crimes tribunals held after World War I. Although he bolsters his case with material from the American, British and German archives, he writes that the remaining Ottoman records are enough to show that the ruling party's central committee “did deliberately attempt to destroy the Armenian population.”
Akcam closely links the 1915 genocide with World War I. The Unionists, as the nationalist leaders were known, dreaded the partition of their empire by the European great powers. Not only did they suspect the Armenians of dangerous disloyalty, Akcam writes, but massacres of Muslims in Christian regions of the faltering empire before World War I had fostered a desire for vengeance.

While never excusing the atrocities, Akcam does argue that the Turkish leaders chose genocide in a mood of stark desperation. Staggered by a series of early military defeats, and by the Allied onslaught at Gallipoli, they fully expected their empire — driven out of so much of its vast territories over the past two centuries — to collapse. The Turkish heartland of Anatolia was threatened — as was Constantinople.

The fiercest Ottoman enemy was Russia, which had nearly seized Constantinople in a bloody 1877-78 war and had a storied history of trying to foment uprisings against Ottoman rule. The Turkish nationalist line puts great weight on the internal menace of pro-Russian Armenians. But Akcam argues that there was little real danger from the Armenian uprisings, which were limited and directed mostly against the deportations. (British officials considered the Armenians militarily useless and thus refused to encourage the uprisings.) Akcam allows that the evacuation of Armenians may have been justified by military necessity in areas where the Armenian revolutionaries were strong — but not throughout the empire.

Two police lieutenants face a similar criminal charge but one gets a slap on the wrist while the other is fired.
One of these two police supervisors is an officer with a distinguished record of exposing corruption and misconduct.
Guess which of those two veteran police officers received the harsher punishment?
The whistle-blower!
Upon firing Lt. Aisha Perry weeks ago, Police Department officials subjected her to the humiliation of a public arrest, complete with ‘perk walk' before television news cameras. But they kept a lid on a secret that casts suspicion on the real reason behind Perry's termination: While publicly firing Perry for theft of utility services, PPD brass were at the same time quietly disciplining seven other Department employees behind the scenes for similar theft of utility service offenses.
But Philadelphia police officials refused to discharge anyone of those thieves who, when confronted by police investigators, admitted their crimes.
Yet, whistle-blower Perry – a 31-year PPD veteran who vigorously denies the utility theft accusation – received both the punishment of termination and that humiliating public arrest.
Those seven PPD employees, including a staff member of a Deputy Police Commissioner, admitted fraudulently obtaining cash grants established to assist low-income residents to pay their utility bills.
One of those seven PPD employees receiving internal PPD discipline — suspensions ranging from three to fifteen days — was a detective lieutenant who earned $94,000 last year, according to city records.
Ironically, after that detective lieutenant completes his fifteen day suspension he will return to duty arresting criminals, despite the fact that he himself is now an admitted criminal.
Compounding the disparity in the severity of action taken against whistle-blower Perry, compared to the Gang of Seven, police sources said that over one hundred other PPD members have faced internal discipline for utility thefts without their cases being referred to prosecutors as were the misconduct claims against Perry.
Although the seeming travesty inherent in the arrest and firing of Lt. Aisha Perry occurred
in Philadelphia, the mistreatment of whistle blowers within police departments is a nationwide problem that generally escapes public scrutiny.
In August, for example, a former policeman in a small town near Los Angeles and a former New Jersey State Trooper both won lawsuits filed after enduring retaliation for their whistle-blowing.
“Whistle-blowers are generally not supported by the administration of law enforcement agencies,” stated a disturbing study on the issue compiled for the International Association of Chiefs of Police a dozen years ago.
While sexism and racism certainly played roles in the two decades of retaliation targeting Lt. Perry, a pivotal instigator involved in these assaults against her is the warped concept among police that whistle-blowing violates the “Code of Silence” practiced by many police.
This unofficial “Code of Silence,” which is pervasive within the police culture across America, demands silence from law enforcers about lawlessness within police ranks as a perverse expression of solidarity among police officers.
The Chiefs of Police study in question found that 46 percent of the officers interviewed admitted witnessing misconduct by another officer “but concealed what they knew” –- practicing the Code of Silence.
Equally outrageous was that study's finding that 80 percent of those “admitting withholding evidence” of police misconduct were persons within the upper ranks of police departments.
Lt. Aisha Perry won a federal lawsuit she filed against the PPD in the late 1990s charging ranking PPD personnel with denying her a promotion as retaliation for her arresting a drunken hit-&-run driver who turned out to be an off-duty Philadelphia policeman.
Although the federal judge presiding at Perry's whistle-blowing trial specifically admonished Philadelphia's then Police Commissioner to halt attacks against Perry, PPD supervisors nonetheless slapped her with a series of misconduct charges on the first day she returned to work following that federal jury ruling in her favor.
A vile example of the harassment constantly targeting Perry is an anonymous malicious letter which falsely accused Perry of involvement in a 2010 fatal car crash.
That letter writer – who possessed police-specific information – laid fault for the two fatalities during that 2010 crash “squarely on [the] shoulders” of Lt. Perry.
Fortunately for Perry, facts contained in PPD documents about that 2010 crash in Philadelphia's upscale East Falls section easily refute that anonymous letter writer's false accusations.
Further, those facts exposed errors in news media reports about that crash that relied on PPD-provided information.
The December 2010 crash occurred as a police sergeant chased a car after police command ordered officers not to engage in pursuit.
That policewoman denied hearing the stop-chase order from police radio command.
The car chased by the sergeant went out of control during the hi-speed pursuit down narrow School House Lane, striking a tree and bursting into flames.
Two men burned to death inside the car while a third occupant was thrown from the vehicle.
Police initially tagged the survivor of the wreck as the driver but were flummoxed when the survivor's family stated he was blind and couldn't have driven any vehicle.
News reports of that crash reported that it occurred “after” police ended their pursuit, making no reference to the active pursuit by the policewoman.
Those news reports also listed the survivor – the blind man – as the driver of the car.
One police accident investigator, incensed by what he considered errant acts by the sergeant, initially recorded that car crash as “manslaughter-gross negligence-no arrest.”
Lt. Perry did come to that accident scene after the crash, taking charge as a ranking supervisor at the chaotic scene, performing supervisory duties that the pursuing sergeant did not.
Police investigators interviewed Perry about the allegations in that anonymous letter but dropped the matter as unfounded.
The family of one of those fatally burned in that 2010 crash recently filed a federal lawsuit against the City of Philadelphia and against the pursuing officer, Sgt. Christine Fitzgerald.
That lawsuit contends Fitzgerald failed to follow the PPD's Directive 41 that limits high-speed chases in urban areas because of the “significant risk of personal injury and death recognized” by PPD and City officials as potentially being caused by such chases.
“Defendant Fitzgerald's actions were arbitrary and taken in reckless indifference to the safety” of that vehicle's occupants, that lawsuit alleged.
PPD spokesmen said the Department would not comment on the lawsuit or the incident since the “case is still active.” A PPD spokesman said Internal Affairs is completing its investigation into the 2010 crash, including an examination of possible violations of Department regulations.
Aside from the crash issue, Philadelphia police and prosecutors charged Perry with stealing utility services, claiming she had tampered with meters to obtain electric, gas and water service without paying. Curiously, police and prosecutors failed to publicly provide any details about Perry's alleged misconduct as would be standard procedure in arrests.
Supporters of Perry see her arrest as another instance of retaliatory assault against this whistle-blower.
Such a contention is not without foundation, given the sordid history of retaliatory acts against whistle-blowers by PPD personnel and police union officials — acts that that take place both on the job and after work.
For example, retaliation drove three white policemen –- Ray Carnation and brothers Bill and Mike McKenna –- who had reported on cases of racism and misconduct by fellow officers, out of the PPD in the late 1990s.
They received a record-setting $10-million federal jury verdict in a whistle-blower lawsuit, but City Hall appeals and suspect rulings by a federal judge stripped them of their rightful reward for retaliation.
Police whistle-blowers frequently find little support from their police union, the fraternal Order of Police.
Earlier this year in Philadelphia, the FOP won its campaign to reinstate a policeman fired for stealing money from civilians even though those acts had been observed by other police officers and documented on video by PPD investigators.

The "hot spot" of marine animals contained many protected species including blue and beaked whales, short-finned pilot whales, melon headed whales and six types of dolphin.
It was uncovered during a study by the Timor government and Australian researchers.
Principal scientist Karen Edyvane said: "It's among the world's hot spots. We were all amazed to see such an abundance, diversity and density. Most of them are actually protected."
In just one day, as many as 2,000 whales in eight separate pods – each one containing up to 400 mammals – were spotted over a 30-mile stretch of coast.
The survey was done by East Timorese researchers and experts from the Australian Institute of Marine Science, working from a traditional 20-metre wooden Indonesian vessel.
Deep ocean channels of the Wetar and Ombai straits, which plummet more than 3,000 metres (9,800 ft), were a major migratory route for marine wildlife moving between the Pacific and Indian oceans, including large sharks and turtles, the study found.
The channels are also used by U.S. nuclear and Australian navy submarines travelling through the Indonesian islands.
The research also highlighted the threat posed by unregulated fishing in the region as East Timor looks to make money by developing its fishing industry while searching out potentially lucrative ecotourism opportunities like whale-watching.

SAN FRANCISCO — It's not rocket science. It's neuroscience.
Thync (pronounced "think") is the rare tech start-up whose ultimate rivals aren't other tech start-ups.
Instead, the company's wearable technology is better understood when compared to human mood-enhancers like red wine, energy drinks, coffee or drugs.
What Thync hopes to do — in 10 minutes or less — is create in its users nothing less than a desired state of mind, or mode, ranging from calm to creative to energetic.
"We can trigger these modes using neurotransmitters," says CEO and co-founder Isy Goldwasser.
It's a big goal that uses a simple headpiece that, in its beta version, is composed of two foam and plastic pads connected by a wire whose power can be controlled with an easy-to-use mobile app.
I recently tested the product along with USA TODAY San Francisco Bureau Chief Jon Swartz.
Based on how well it worked on both of us, Thync has the potential to create the most transformative consumer technology to come out of Silicon Valley in a long time.
To get there, though, the Los Gatos, Calif.-based company will have to come up with a finished product that passes muster with both consumers and regulators.
Toward those ends, Thync is "in dialog" with the Federal Drug Administration while it works out the kinks in its hardware and software, Goldwasser says.
The underlying technology is based on more than a decade of research done by Thync co-founder and Chief Science Officer Jamie Tyler of Arizona State University and Thync Executive Director Sumon Pal of Harvard, respectively.
The research has shown that human states of mind create in the brain electrical patterns that are consistent and recognizable.
In a process known as neuro-signaling, these patterns can be recreated using tiny electrical pulses.
Humans experience various mental states during which we feel calmer or have more energy, willpower or creativity, says Goldwasser.
"We have them, but can't call them up" on command, he says.
Thync is working to change that.
The company has been conducting laboratory tests for more than a year that involve hundreds of people, including students at City College of New York.
About three-quarters of them report receiving a "strong" or "moderate" response from the device, with "moderate" meaning like that experienced having "one to two cups of coffee," says Tyler.
More recently, Thync has begun field testing among its employees, family and friends.
In mid-November, Goldwasser, Tyler and Pal came to USA TODAY's San Francisco offices to demonstrate the beta version of the product.
For now, Thync offers users two options: I tested what's called the "energy vibe," while Swartz chose the setting designed to promote calm in the user's brain.
We each chose 12-minute tests and went into separate offices to conduct them.
The headpiece I wore had pads on the right temple and behind my right ear, while the "calm vibe" wearable Swartz used went between his right temple and the back of his neck.
Using the dials on the app to control the mood of my own brain was a bit unsettling at first, especially after I felt an uncomfortable twinge of energy behind my right ear.
But after trying several different settings, a power level between two-thirds and three-quarters of maximum smoothed out the experience.
After the later-afternoon test, I felt a sharper mental focus that lasted well into the evening, which included going to the Yahoo holiday party (which is more work than it sounds like).
The next morning, I experienced what felt like an elevated level of energy — even though I skipped my usual cup or two of coffee.
Swartz experienced an even more profound effect, reporting that his calming vibe lasted three days.
Replicating those type of results consistently will take many more months of field testing, says Goldwasser.
In the meantime, the company is careful not to call its product a medicine or treatment, despite its effects.
"The device isn't intended to treat or diagnose any disease or medical condition," he says, and is geared toward a mass audience.
Of other human mood-helpers ranging from Red Bull to red wine now used by hundreds of millions of consumers around the globe, Goldwasser adds: "Normal people need and use them."
The company has raised $13 million from investors, including Khosla Ventures.
Thync plans to demo the device in Las Vegas in early January, simultaneous with the huge Consumer Electronics Show, and have a product available on the market sometime next year.

At the beginning of the year, the City of Philadelphia attempted to replace Chestnut Street's bus shelters with new ones, which would have meant the deaccessioning of stained-glass art installations that currently beautify eleven of the street's transit stops.
But the Art Commission, and the public, wasn't having it. Even the artist, Pablo Tauler, didn't care for the proposed removal of the art he created for the city back in 1999.
The backlash at the commission's January meeting got so fierce that the city withdrew their deaccessioning proposal and promised to find another path forward.
At September's Art Commission meeting on Wednesday, the city unveiled its alternative proposal.
The stained-glass artwork will still be removed — the bus shelters it beautifies are too far gone to repair — but it will be put in storage with the intent to make use of Tauler's work again.
After an hour of debate, the commissioners signed off on the artwork's removal and storage and the staggered installation of the new shelters as the old ones become too rusted for use. They also asked the city to take a serious look at their ability to incorporate Tauler's artwork into the new shelters and to come up with a schedule for reusing whichever pieces can't be placed there.
After the meeting Patricia Ellis Dinatale, transit program manager for the city's Office of Transportation and Infrastructure systems, told PlanPhilly that even if the art can be placed in the shelters, there is no guarantee the artwork would be reinstalled in exactly the same places. But she said the Chestnut Street option would be given priority. She emphasized that the city is no longer asking to deaccession the artwork.
Commissioners impressed upon the city that a rigorous schedule would need to be kept when it came to reusing the Tauler's work.
“I'm concerned this could go into a storage blackhole,” said Natalie Nixon, a commissioner and professor at Philadelphia University. “As part of moving this forward, I would like you to commit to a really specific timeline and written out plan so that five years later these aren't just abandoned relics.”
In its presentation, the city stated that they removed the bus shelter and art installation at 12th and Chestnut Streets in August for the purpose of studying its condition.
They found that the shelter's base beam suffered from serious corrosion. The leg supports were badly rusting. In one case, a leg was so badly deteriorated, and riddled with holes, that water and detritus accumulated inside it. When workers sawed the leg off, gallons of rusty water came pouring out.
Given the sorry state of the shelters, and the fact that they are so outdated that replacement parts are impossible to acquire, Commission Chairman Alan Greenberger reminded his colleagues that the art would need to be moved no matter what.
“That's out of our hands,” said Greenberger. “The question before the commission is what happens afterwards.”
The Art Commission members still appeared frustrated at the idea that funds are lacking for the repair, or rapid reinstallation of the stained glass panels in a roughly similar formation their currently placement. The shelters are being replaced as part of a plan that will eventually double the overall number, paid for thanks to new digital advertisements on the sides of the new shelters. The ads are expected to generate at least $100 million for the city's general fund over the next 20 years.
Greenberger concluded the meeting by asking the city to produce a report on whether the artwork can be incorporated into the new shelters quickly — preferably in the next month or two. As a result, the Art Commission will likely be hearing more about the future of Tauler's work later this fall.
PATNA: Union home minister Sushilkumar Shinde drew attention toward alleged "misuse" of social media in forking old "provocative" photographs to foment communal riots and said his ministry was mulling to put a check on it."Sitting in home ministry I see old provocative photographs being circulated on Facebook which results in communal riots," Shinde said in an indirect reference to Muzaffarnagar riots.The minister was addressing a function at the launch of a Hindi newspaper here. Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar and RJD president Lalu Prasad were also present."Recently there were some provocative items about Northeast and strict action was taken," Shinde said."Seeing the evil impact of social media which is taking the society on a wrong direction we are thinking of imposing a check on them," the Union Home minister said.Shinde lamented "twisting" of facts in the name of investigative journalism and said it was a challenge for the media to uphold honest journalism."There is a question mark today on how much truth media reports give... its a big challenge for newspapers to maintain honesty of journalism," he said.Shinde said the print media also faces challenge from faster mode of delivery of information on internet.
The gravity of the world's current extinction rate becomes clearer upon knowing what it was before people came along. A new estimate finds that species die off as much as 1,000 times more frequently nowadays than they used to. That's 10 times worse than the old estimate of 100 times.
PROVIDENCE, R.I. [Brown University] — It's hard to comprehend how bad the current rate of species extinction around the world has become without knowing what it was before people came along. The newest estimate is that the pre-human rate was 10 times lower than scientists had thought, which means that the current level is 10 times worse.
Extinctions are about 1,000 times more frequent now than in the 60 million years before people came along. The explanation from lead author Jurriaan de Vos, a Brown University postdoctoral researcher, senior author Stuart Pimm, a Duke University professor, and their team appears online in the journal Conservation Biology.
“This reinforces the urgency to conserve what is left and to try to reduce our impacts,” said de Vos, who began the work while at the University of Zurich. “It was very, very different before humans entered the scene.”
In absolute, albeit rough, terms the paper calculates a “normal background rate” of extinction of 0.1 extinctions per million species per year. That revises the figure of 1 extinction per million species per year that Pimm estimated in prior work in the 1990s. By contrast, the current extinction rate is more on the order of 100 extinctions per million species per year.
Orders of magnitude, rather than precise numbers are about the best any method can do for a global extinction rate, de Vos said. “That's just being honest about the uncertainty there is in these type of analyses.”
From fossils to genetics
The new estimate improves markedly on prior ones mostly because it goes beyond the fossil record. Fossils are helpful sources of information, but their shortcomings include disproportionate representation of hard-bodied sea animals and the problem that they often only allow identification of the animal or plant's genus, but not its exact species.
What the fossils do show clearly is that apart from a few cataclysms over geological periods — such as the one that eliminated the dinosaurs — biodiversity has slowly increased.
The new study next examined evidence from the evolutionary family trees — phylogenies — of numerous plant and animal species. Phylogenies, constructed by studying DNA, trace how groups of species have changed over time, adding new genetic lineages and losing unsuccessful ones. They provide rich details of how species have diversified over time.
“The diversification rate is the speciation rate minus the extinction rate,” said co-author Lucas Joppa, a scientist at Microsoft Research in Redmond, Wash. “The total number of species on earth has not been declining in recent geological history. It is either constant or increasing. Therefore, the average rate at which groups grew in their numbers of species must have been similar to or higher than the rate at which other groups lost species through extinction.”
The work compiled scores of studies of molecular phylogenies on how fast species diversified.
For a third approach, de Vos noted that the exponential climb of species diversity should take a steeper upward turn in the current era because the newest species haven't gone extinct yet.
“It's rather like your bank account on the day you get paid,” he said. “It gets a burst of funds — akin to new species — that will quickly become extinct as you pay your bills.”
By comparing that rise of the number of species from the as-yet unchecked speciation rate with the historical trend (it was “log-linear”) evident in the phylogenies, he could therefore create a predictive model of what the counteracting historical extinction rate must have been.
The researchers honed their models by testing them with simulated data for which they knew an actual extinction rate. The final models yielded accurate results. They tested the models to see how they performed when certain key assumptions were wrong and on average the models remained correct (in the aggregate, if not always for every species group).
All three data approaches together yielded a normal background extinction rate squarely in the order of 0.1 extinctions per million species per year.
A human role
There is little doubt among the scientists that humans are not merely witnesses to the current elevated extinction rate. This paper follows a recent one in Science , authored by Pimm, Joppa, and other colleagues, that tracks where species are threatened or confined to small ranges around the globe. In most cases, the main cause of extinctions is human population growth and per capita consumption, although the paper also notes how humans have been able to promote conservation.
The new study, Pimm said, emphasizes that the current extinction rate is a more severe crisis than previously understood.
“We've known for 20 years that current rates of species extinctions are exceptionally high,” said Pimm, president of the conservation nonprofit organization SavingSpecies. “This new study comes up with a better estimate of the normal background rate — how fast species would go extinct were it not for human actions. It's lower than we thought, meaning that the current extinction crisis is much worse by comparison.”
Other authors on the paper are John Gittleman and Patrick Stephens of the University of Georgia.
[UPDATE 8/13] Halo 3 has been added to Team Hardcore once again, and it works this time. Make sure to test out the playlist the next time you are on Halo: The Master Chief Collection!
Before Halo: The Master Chief Collection launched, 343 Industries announced their plans for the day one playlist line up and on that list was Team Hardcore – a collection of tournaments approved gametypes from both Halo 2 and Halo 3.
Slightly before launch, they announced that Halo 3 wouldn't be included in the playlist because they didn't have the appropriate tools to port over maps like Onslaught and Amplified and promised that once they had these tools, they would add Halo 3 to the playlist.
A short while ago, 343 Industries added some Forge maps to matchmaking, implying that they now had the tools to add Halo 3's tournament gametypes to Team Hardcore but Bravo said on Twitter that there were issues adding these maps to the playlist.
@Killa_Kev_Z more news for you soon. I know the delay has undoubtedly been frustrating – will update as soon as I've got something. — Andy Dudynsky (@Brav) July 30, 2015
What issues were stopping the Halo 3 tournament maps being added is beyond me but regardless, we'll move on.
Today, there was a new playlist update for Halo: The Master Chief Collection which finally added Halo 3 to the Team Hardcore playlist, kind of.
As soon as the update released, players were quick to jump into Team Hardcore and try to play Halo 3. However, once any sort of Halo 3 gametype was voted for, the map would fail to load and boot the player back to the main menu.
The video clip above should demonstrate what happens whenever Halo 3 is voted for.
A few tweets from Bravo on Twitter seems to show that they are planning on removing Halo 3 from Team Hardcore for the time being while these issues are resolved:
@TheLittleMoa @GBShady Thanks guys. We're going to have the team revert back for the time being and take a look at what's going on. (cont) — Andy Dudynsky (@Brav) August 6, 2015
@TheLittleMoa @GBShady this isn't map based as much as it is integration / dedicated server based, so may need a larger fix. will (2/3) — Andy Dudynsky (@Brav) August 6, 2015
@TheLittleMoa @GBShady provide more updates as soon as they're available. apologies for the frustration. — Andy Dudynsky (@Brav) August 6, 2015
As of writing this article, today's matchmaking update which added Halo 3 to Team Hardcore has been removed and Team Hardcore is once again a playlist for Halo 2 Classic tournament gametypes.
What are your thoughts on the botched implementation of Halo 3 into the Team Hardcore playlist? Be sure to join the discussion on our forums now and let your opinion be heard.

The renowned climate scientist told New Matilda today future generations are “screwed” if we continue to emit carbon dioxide, at an event where some of the world's top climate scientists endorse nuclear as a key part of the solution. Thom Mitchell reports from Paris.
A panel of eminent scientists – including James Hansen, the former head of NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies and a man dubbed ‘the Father of Climate Change' – has called on governments and environmentalists to accept nuclear energy as part of the solution to the climate crisis, at a side event to global negotiations that got underway in Paris this week.
They told media the two degree target that negotiators involved in the United Nations talks are aiming for is based on politics, not science, and the world needs to use every means available to curb emissions.
Renewable energy like wind and solar, they said, would not be enough alone.
“I think all of us here [on the panel]feel that carbon dioxide emissions are dangerous and that there are no emissions which are acceptable, and we need to be stopping all carbon dioxide emissions,” said Dr Ken Caldeira of the Carnegie Institution for Science.
“I've likened it to mugging little old ladies,” he said. “You say, ‘Okay what should our target be for the rate of mugging little old ladies'? And you say, ‘Oh, well the target should be zero'. And that doesn't mean necessarily we're going to get there tomorrow, but it means that every mugging of a little old lady is a bad thing, and every carbon dioxide emission is a bad thing, and the target is zero,” Dr Caldeira said.
A decorated Australian climate scientist with the University of Adelaide, Dr Tom Wigley stressed the scientists were “not promoting nuclear energy” but rather “a level playing field”.
“We're asking everybody to make sure that because this is such a demanding, challenging problem, we can't close the door to any type of technology,” he said.
“We have to give a fair and balanced assessment, eschewing ideology and preconceptions to decide on what the energy strategy should be.”
Hansen relayed an anecdote – and the thoughts of his young grandson – to highlight what he sees as the blinkered thinking around the “tremendous intergenerational injustice” of climate change and how it's been exacerbated by blinkered thinking on nuclear energy.
“One of the things that he concluded was, you know, ‘grown-ups are scared of nuclear power', but he says ‘they should be scared of climate change',” Hansen said. “We know that using fossil fuels is not safe, it is very dangerous, and we have to face the fact that this danger of fossil fuels is staring us in the face.
“It's absolutely one hundred per cent certain that we've got a very dangerous situation. And for us to say ‘Oh we're not going to use all the tools that we have to try to solve it' is crazy,” Hansen said. “We have to use all of the things that we have at our disposal and clearly nuclear power, next generation nuclear power especially, has tremendous potential to be a big part of the solution.”
Professor Kerry Emanuel – probably the panelist most skeptical of what's usually called renewable energy, wind and solar – said that using those technologies “we can get to 30 per cent, and then you hit a brick wall”.
“You cannot power the world on renewables, you can't do it unless there's a miracle,” he said.
Hansen argued that concerns over the capability of renewables to act as a full substitute for fossil fuels were common to “by far the majority of scientists” he'd spoken to, and that most “agree that nuclear needs to be part of the solution”.
“But when you stand up and say that, there's an anti-nuclear community, which I would characterise as quasi-religious,” he said, “which just hammers you and you have to spend a lot of your time trying to deal with that”.
Hansen said that new generations of nuclear technology, which burn around 99 per cent of radioactive fuel, and therefore produce almost no waste, are “within 5 or 10 year [away]if we give it priority,” but that nuclear power already has a proven track record.
“If you look at France, for example, it has most of its electricity from nuclear power and if you compare the electricity price in France and Germany, it's about half in France what it is in Germany,” he said.
“That's of course an old technology that France is using, but if you look at Sweden, for example, they have carbon-free electricity: That's the solution to the climate problem.
“If we have carbon free electricity in all countries, we've solved the problem, because we can make liquid fuels for transportation from energy if you have abundant carbon-free electricity.
“And the way Sweden did it was build nuclear power plants [in 10 years], and combine that with hydropower; so renewable energy plus nuclear energy provides them carbon-free electricity, and that's what we need,” Hansen said.
The celebrated climate scientist, famous for sounding the alarm and bringing the issue to public attention through evidence he presented to the United States Congress in the late 1980s, said the crucial next step which should receive far more funding is to “come up with designs that can be built rapidly, and that's what's going to happen in China”.
“My hope, to be very frank, is the fact that Chinese leaders are technically trained and they're rational and they have very strong motives for wanting to move to clean energy,” he said.
“Their air pollution is so bad that the public is on the verge of uprising, so they have a very strong reason for wanting to move to clean energies and they're doing as much as they can with solar, with wind, and with nuclear.
“I think that what we're going to see is that they will develop nuclear that they can build rapidly and we, the West, should be working with them to make sure it's as safe as possible.
“That's our responsibility because we burned their fare share of the global carbon budget: We've now basically used up the amount of the carbon budget that we can afford to put in the atmosphere, so now we've got to find clean energies.”

US Secretary of State, John Kerry, and the new Secretary General of the Alliance, Jens Stoltenberg, celebrate the restart of military affairs.
For Washington and its trans-Atlantic alliance, 2014 might have been a bad year, especially in two scenarios: a Europe without war, where, despite the expansion of NATO to the east, stronger economic and political ties were being reinforced between the European Union and Russia and where almost all the allies were reluctant to increase military spending to the level required by the Pentagon; a "Greater Middle East" where the United States and NATO were losing a war in Syria and Iraq was distancing itself from the US and getting closer to China and Russia, an alliance increasingly feared by the White House.
Washington felt more and a more pressing need to find a "new mission" for NATO. This was promptly found. The Maidan Square coup, long prepared and including also leading Ukrainian neo-Nazi forces, brought Europe to a situation similar to that of the Cold War, provoking a new confrontation with Russia. The offensive of the Islamic Emirate, long prepared by financing and arming Islamist groups (some previously defined as terrorists) since the war against Yugoslavia and the one against Libya, allowed the US / NATO forces to intervene in Syria to destroy not the EIS but Syria and to re-occupy Iraq.
NATO's "new mission" was formalized by the September summit in Wales, launching the “reactivated” Action Plan whose stated purpose is to "quickly and firmly respond to new challenges against security", attributed to "military aggression of Russia against Ukraine" and the growth of extremism and sectarian conflict in the Middle East and North Africa. "The Plan is qualified by the Secretary General of NATO, Jens Stoltenberg, as "the greatest reinforcement of our collective defense since the end of the Cold War."
As a start, in just three months NATO has quadrupled dual-purpose conventional and nuclear capability fighter-bombers based in the Baltic region (formerly part of the USSR); it sent AWACS radar planes over Eastern Europe and increased the number warships in the Baltic region, Black Sea and Mediterranean; it deployed US, British and German ground forces (including heavy armored units),in Poland, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania; it intensified joint exercises in Poland and the Baltic countries, bringing them during the year to more than 200.
Always on the basis of Action Plan "reactivity" the "NATO Response Force" was launched by establishing "packets" of land, air and naval units able to be projected quickly in Eastern Europe, the Middle East, Central Asia (including Afghanistan, where NATO remains with its special forces), Africa and other regions. In this context a new very high speed "Joint Task Force" will be formed able to be "deployed in days, especially on the periphery of NATO territory."
Simultaneously, in Riga (Latvia), the "NATO Strategic Communications Centre of Excellence" was opened responsible for conducting the new Cold War against Russia with various instruments, including "informational and psychological operations." Under the agreement signed on July 1 with the Allied Command Transformation (Norfolk, VA), Italy is also part of the Centre of Excellence for the new Cold War with Great Britain, Germany, Poland and the three Baltic republics.
Thus Italy and the EU contribute to open the "new dialogue area with Moscow" announced by Federica Mogherini, high representative for EU foreign policy.
College kids have a pretty easy time getting their way on campus. Just make enough of a stink and the universities cave.
Unfortunately, these students eventually reach a little place called the real world, where things aren't so forgiving. One recently wrote in to an advice columnist because the antics he'd gotten away with elsewhere suddenly didn't work.
You see, Junior was at his internship, and he wanted the company to have a more lax dress code. Plus, they noticed one of the regular staff wearing shoes that weren't in line with the standard dress code, and that just wasn't right. So, this individual got together with his fellow interns and wrote up a proposal for an alternate dress code (hmm ... ) accompanied with a petition (whoops!) and sent it on.
Hilarity ensued:
The next day, all of us who signed the petition were called into a meeting where we thought our proposal would be discussed. Instead, we were informed that due to our “unprofessional” behavior, we were being let go from our internships. We were told to hand in our ID badges and to gather our things and leave the property ASAP. We were shocked. The proposal was written professionally like examples I have learned about in school, and our arguments were thought out and well-reasoned. We weren't even given a chance to discuss it. The worst part is that just before the meeting ended, one of the managers told us that the worker who was allowed to disobey the dress code was a former soldier who lost her leg and was therefore given permission to wear whatever kind of shoes she could walk in. You can't even tell, and if we had known about this we would have factored it into our argument.
The reality is that colleges -- the educational institutions that are theoretically supposed to prepare these kids for the real world -- did these students a disservice by treating every petition or pet cause as valid, allowing the inmates to run the asylum. When the students hit the real world, WHAM!
The illegality of the Obama Administration's actions is underscored by the way their story keeps changing. The White House began by hinting that the 30-day notification requirement is unconstitutional. But it is unwilling to press that claim. Its current position is that Congress didn't intend the law to say what it says.
The extreme vision of executive power that results can be seen in the 450-word statement that the National Security Council released to reporters through a spokesperson:
... the notification requirement should be construed not to apply to this unique set of circumstances, in which the transfer would secure the release of a captive U.S. soldier and the Secretary of Defense, acting on behalf of the President, has determined that providing notice as specified in the statute could endanger the soldier's life. In these circumstances, delaying the transfer in order to provide the 30-day notice would interfere with the Executive's performance of two related functions that the Constitution assigns to the President: protecting the lives of Americans abroad and protecting U.S. soldiers. Because such interference would significantly alter the balance between Congress and the President, and could even raise Constitutional concerns, we believe it is fair to conclude that Congress did not intend that the Administration would be barred from taking the action it did in these circumstances.
The radical claim: A statute can be ignored so long as the secretary of defense determines that violating it is necessary to protect Americans abroad or U.S. soldiers.
Yet almost anything could be "determined" to endanger Americans abroad.
Former Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld must be wondering how the Obama administration can continue to insist that Bush-era "enhanced interrogation" was illegal. The Bush administration certainly "determined" that its torture of prisoners was necessary to protect American military and civilian personnel abroad. I'm beginning to wonder if Obama now thinks that whether the president can crush a child's testicles depends in part on why he believes he needs to do it.
Should Obama defenders return to the questionable argument that the 30-day notification requirement is unconstitutional, they'll run into the fact that it falls under Congress's Article I power to "make Rules for the Government and Regulation of the land and naval forces," as Ilya Somin explains at The Volokh Conspiracy:
The five Taliban prisoners were in military custody at Guantanamo. Regulations governing the treatment and release of prisoners by the military are at the very core of Congress' power under this clause. When the president acts in his capacity as commander-in-chief ... he must obey congressional laws enacted under this power, no less than any other military leader. As liberal Democrats correctly pointed out during the Bush administration, it was illegal for the president to order the use of coercive interrogation methods against prisoners in violation of congressionally enacted statutes barring such torture. The same constitutional rule applies here.
In response to a critic who points out that the commander in chief controls tactical aspects of military operations, Somin goes on to draw some useful distinctions:
Congress has adopted laws regulating the abuse, torture, and other mistreatment of prisoners—even in cases where the president might think that torturing a prisoner is tactically advantageous. Congress has adopted laws restricting the use of chemical and biological weapons—again even in cases where the president might think it would be tactically advantageous to do so. The same goes for laws restricting the release of prisoners. The president might think it is tactically advantageous to make lopsided exchanges with terrorists. But Congress might disagree, and choose to ban such deals, or—as in this case—at least subject them to scrutiny by imposing a modest reporting requirement .... If Congress can restrict the types of weapons the president has at his disposal, and the kind of treatment he can subject prisoners to, they can also restrict the release of prisoners. Perhaps Congress would be unduly infringing on the president's powers as commander-in-chief if it tried to make individual tactical decisions on a case-by-case basis (e.g.—appointing a committee to screen individual prisoners and decide which of them should be released, based on individualized tactical considerations). But that's not what Congress has done here.
He concluded that the intent of Congress was clear:
It has imposed a general rule requiring 30 days advance notice for the release of any non-American prisoner held at Guantanamo, regardless of individual tactical circumstances. This is not like saying that the President must defend Hill X, but not Hill Y. This is like limiting the range of weapons or tactics that can be used to defend any hill, or at least any hill located in a particular part of the world. That sort of restriction is at the very heart of Congress' power to make rules for the government and regulation of the armed forces.
And again, who signed that law imposing the 30-day reporting requirement in the first place? Obama did. "If the president truly believed that the bill was unconstitutional, he had a duty to veto the bill pursuant to his oath to uphold and defend the Constitution," a commenter at The Volokh Conspiracy points out. "President Obama didn't veto the bill, and instead made it the law of the land. Having done so, he cannot now complain that the law he is ultimately responsible for is unconstitutional and doesn't need to be followed .... A country where the laws apply to the people but not to the president, even when the laws are specifically directed towards the executive branch, is not governed by the rule of law."
A young Chinese woman had an intense public meltdown in Hong Kong after being dumped by her long-time boyfriend back home through text on the messaging app WeChat.
It is unknown why the woman, who comes from the Guangdong province of Mainland China, was in Hong Kong at the time. She began throwing an uncontrollable tantrum in the middle of the historic Granville Road in Tsim Sha Tsui, an urban area in southern Kowloon. The woman threw herself on the floor and began thrashing her arms and legs about, screaming at anyone who passed by.
She reportedly yelled:
“God, save me!
“I want to be with you forever!
“I don't want to live anymore!”
Passers-by gathered around, and those attempting to help her failed. One man appears to have posed for a picture in front of the irate woman.
“Twenty-six years! In my dreams, I see you, do you understand?
“My heart is here! My soul is at home! My lover is at home.
“I told you not to bother me! You said you wanted to help me! Wanted to give me this and that!”
“Why did you bother me? Why?
“I'm going to cry it all out! I want to be with you forever! Lord! Save me!
“Someone beat me to death please! I've known him for 26 years! Do you guys understand?! You guys are useless! USELESS!”
While she claimed to have known her ex-boyfriend for 26 years, the woman was later identified as a 24-year-old from Maoming, China.
Police eventually arrived on the scene and tied the woman down to a stretcher before she was transported to the hospital.
Lesson: when people break up through text message, the whole world suffers.
Sacramento Kings fans don't understand. They don't understand how their loyalty, always durable, often completely illogical given their team's laughable mismanagement, isn't powerful enough to keep their team from moving to Seattle.
The team's flagship radio station is doing everything it can: playing the John Belushi "Animal House" motivation speech on promos while the hosts exhort the fans to fight the power. It's not over 'til the moving vans arrive might sound good, but the fans have no control. They should be used to it, though, or at least jaded by the process. Those who aren't disgusted are organizing rallies and pledging money and trying to sell out the arena -- oh, how the Brothers Maloof must absolutely hate that form of punishment -- to convince the NBA board of governors how serious they are about proving to the world how much they deserve to keep their team.

There's nothing wrong with the effort. It gives them an outlet for their frustration, but that doesn't make it any less delusional. They don't matter, and they never have. They've sold out the building in 19 of the 27 seasons in Sacramento -- doesn't matter. They cheered for every Brook Steppe and Quincy Douby who wore the purple -- doesn't matter.
They didn't do anything to put their team in this position, and they can't do anything to stop it. Welcome to the big business of professional sports.
The Maloof family, fronted by three brothers who saw their family fortune dwindle as they oversaw a basketball team that hasn't made the playoffs since 2006, have agreed to sell the team to a group that will move it to Seattle.
The price: reportedly an NBA-record $525 million, a total that includes the NBA relocation fee as well as payoffs for large loans the Maloofs took from the city of Sacramento and the NBA.
After clearing the Maloofs' debt and fees, the Seattle group's 65 percent interest comes out to a cool $340 million.
Incompetence has its benefits, depending on your station in life.
They had an arena deal, personally negotiated by David Stern, and the Maloofs turned their backs on it last spring when they refused to pay predevelopment costs of around $7 million even though the city of Sacramento agreed to come up with $255 million for an arena to house the Maloofs' investment. If the unlikely happens and a local owner appears to keep the team in town, the arena plan remains in place.
When news of the Seattle involvement first broke, the Maloofs said the team was not for sale. They owe the city -- the city they refuse to address -- $77 million. The Seattle group has agreed to give the Maloofs a $30 million nonrefundable deposit. You thought your landlord had it good. If the league nixes the deal and keeps the team in Sacramento, the Maloofs will pocket that $30 million in addition to the sale price offered by a future and still-hypothetical Sacramento group.
There's nothing we hate more than ungrateful professional athletes. We look at their salaries and their effort and pass judgment. This guy doesn't deserve what he's being paid, and that guy over there must have some guts to complain about his deal considering how little he produced. But what about the owners? What's their responsibility to their communities? Marc Ganis, the president of SportsCorp, a firm that brokers team sales, told The New York Times, "By all their machinations, the Maloofs have killed the potential for the team in Sacramento."
It doesn't help that Sacramento can't seem to shake its small-town identity. Take the news conference Sacramento mayor Kevin Johnson held Tuesday, when he announced a coalition of 19 -- now 20 -- local business owners who have pledged $1 million each to buy the Kings.
Kings fans have something to say, but only those who can write a check for the team have any chance of changing the ownership conversation. AP Photo/Rich Pedroncelli
Geez, only a half-billion to go? Assuming it's the day his people wash his pants, Microsoft chief Steve Ballmer probably has $20 million rolling around in the drum of his dryer right now.
(And, really, if we're on the topic of narcissistic, power-drunk owners, this doesn't help: "I'm doing this for one reason: it's time to fight," said Phil Oates, son of a wealthy Sacramento developer and one of those pledging $1 million. "Somebody wants something that I own. It's mine, and I'm not giving it up easily. I owe it to my kids. I owe it to my grandchild that's going to be born in May and named after me. I owe it to my neighbors. I owe it to my friends. I owe it to [Sacramento] to fight and go down swinging.")
The plutocrats who own NBA teams will look at the $19 million news conference as a reason Sacramento can't be taken seriously. Johnson is on the search for a "whale" -- his word -- but Seattle has already come up with two of them. If you're interested in breaking it down to a level of statistical ridiculousness, the Chris Hansen/Ballmer offer, in pure monetary terms, amounts to more than $35 million each for the right to employ Travis Outlaw and James Johnson and every one of the 16-26 Kings.
The Maloofs have reportedly told local media they don't trust Johnson, and therefore couldn't do business with him, which is a clever way of creating a straw man if your ultimate endgame is to ignore Sacramento and extract the most money from a city willing to overpay for a replacement franchise.
Make no mistake: The Maloofs' financial situation forced this move. The Kings used to be their high-end hood ornament; now the team is their whole car. Hansen and Ballmer turned it from a Subaru into a Bentley.
And if Sacramento, a city that repeatedly prostrated itself to make the Maloofs love its fans, has to be collateral damage -- well, that's just business.

A selfie taken in the home of a friend led to the arrest of a Dewey Beach man last weekend after police learned he had been sleeping there uninvited while the family was not there, police said Friday.
Thomas Timlin, 26, was charged April 5 with two counts each of burglary and four counts of theft under $1,500, Sgt. Clifford Dempsey said.
The investigation began last week when the 57-year-old homeowner reported a burglary to police at the McKinley Street home.
The homeowner, who lives in Pennsylvania and comes down to Dewey Beach on the weekends, told investigators that on Feb. 16 he let Timlin sleep at the residence. He said he has not seen him since.
But over the next several weekends, the family began noticing that food and drinks were missing from the home and they realized that someone had been staying there, Dempsey said.
Last week, a family member was given a photo of Timlin apparently taken in the home after Feb. 16 when he was last seen there.
Officers removed evidence from the home and obtained warrants for Timlin on burglary and theft charges. Timlin was also wanted on active capiases from several courts in Sussex County.
While conducting a property check at the house on Saturday, officers found Timlin inside sleeping on the couch, Dempsey said.
Timlin was committed to the Sussex County Correctional Institution after failing to post $8,000 secured bail.

When life hands you a lemon, you might as well try to make lemonade out of it. The Dallas Mavericks are doing exactly that as DeAndre Jordan's change of heart saga came to an end. As the heated discussion of whether DeAndre Jordan and the Los Angeles Clippers organization were unprofessional and unethical is moving away, the more practical question is being asked about the Dallas Mavericks—should the team consider tanking next season in order to secure the top-7 protected first-round pick that went to the Boston Celtics during Rajon Rondo trade?
As miserable as the situation seemed, many experts predicted Mark Cuban and the front office to seriously consider tanking to secure a top prospect next offseason. In fact there were reports on Mark Cuban publicly stating (before DeAndre Jordan overturned his verbal commitment) how the team would have tanked if they couldn't land DeAndre Jordan. Now that the team actually failed to land him, it would make sense to consider tanking for at least a year. Besides, with the franchise's superstar Dirk Nowitzki aging quickly, it wouldn't be a bad idea to look for another future star in the next draft. However, this route meant the end of not only Dirk Nowitzki's era but also the end of being a Playoffs contending team.
That was why DeAndre Jordan was the top priority free agent for the Dallas Mavericks this offseason because he could have been the perfect fit for the team. He would have given Dirk Nowitzki a chance to compete again for another ring and also eventually become the face of the franchise along with Chandler Parsons in the future. Because the transition from Dirk Nowitzki to other players would have been smooth, acquiring DeAndre Jordan was a risk that the Mavericks were willing to take. This decision led the Mavericks to not even bother re-signing players like Tyson Chandler, Monta Ellis, Amar'e Stoudemire, and Al-Farouq Aminu.
Unfortunately, DeAndre Jordan, who was supposed to be the “center” piece of the franchise, single-handedly destroyed the Dallas Mavericks' plan and decided to fall back to his comfort zone, the Los Angeles Clippers. There is no doubt that DeAndre Jordan has made a great impact on the Dallas Mavericks without ever wearing the royal blue-and-white uniform.
Besides the fact that he was extremely unprofessional, this incident definitely changed the Dallas Mavericks' game plan not only this offseason but also in the coming years. Because he changed his thoughts just before the end of the moratorium period, the Dallas Mavericks lost so many opportunities to consider other options. This fact is more detrimental because the Dallas Mavericks have relied heavily on free agents every year to compete in the Playoffs and this year was no exception. As a consequence, it was natural for people to think that the Mavericks should tank as there is no other good free agents left in the market at this point.
However, Mark Cuban publicly stated how the team will not tank next season and the front office's moves seem to support that statement. The Dallas Mavericks are making aggressive moves to fill in the holes. Wesley Matthews was given a maximum contract of $70 million for 4 years. The Dallas Mavericks traded away a second round pick for Zaza Pachulia, a veteran from the Milwaukee Bucks who can give solid minutes in the center spot. Most importantly, there are numerous reports how the Dallas Mavericks will most likely sign Deron Williams who was just bought out from the Brooklyn Nets. (I am being cautious this time as the team did not announce the signing of Deron Williams yet.)
Considering the fact that the Dallas Mavericks missed out on a chance to go after Roy Hibbert or Kosta Koufos because the team had verbal commitment from DeAndre Jordan, acquiring Zaza Pachulia as the starting center was probably the best possible move for the team. Zaza Pachulia is a much better center than the other alternatives that were in the free agent market. Combined with securing Wesley Matthews and getting a possible backcourt partner Deron Williams will definitely put the Mavericks in a better position.
Next season will probably be painful for many Dallas Mavericks fans, but the fact that the front office is giving another push this offseason is promising to the shocked fans. However, there is a blatant risk in this decision. In the worst case scenario, the Dallas Mavericks might do poorly in the regular season to miss the Playoffs but also not bad enough to retain the top-7 protected first round pick from the Boston Celtics. This is something the Dallas Mavericks would absolutely want to avoid by making the Playoffs especially when the direction of the franchise seems to be reloading instead of rebuilding.
The Dallas Mavericks fans will remember two Jordans who played in the NBA in the future thanks to DeAndre Jordan overturning his verbal commitment. His lack of communication and immature way of handling the issue put the Dallas Mavericks on a very tough spot. However, the team is showing signs of recovery and doesn't seem to want to collapse for the first-round pick that went to the Boston Celtics. In that case, it would be interesting to see DeAndre Jordan and the Los Angeles Clippers visiting the American Airline Center next season because the Dallas Mavericks might have a team that can put up a good fight by then.

A Huffington Post food blogger cheated in order to take home a silver medal at the Fort Lauderdale half marathon.
Jane Seo, a 2014 Harvard graduate, was busted after an eagle-eyed blogger noticed a discrepancy between her race tracker and the course. Seo was a veteran obstacle course racer before becoming a competitive runner. She recounted the initial struggles of her transition to jogging in a 2015 Huffington Post article.
"If you had asked me a year ago if I would do a running race of any distance—5K, 10K, or even a half marathon—I would have immediately brushed it off and said, ‘No, I hate running,'" she said.
It turned out that she did not enjoy running enough to complete the full course in Fort Lauderdale. Her fitness tracker revealed that she had shaved one and a half miles off of the 13.1-mile course. She crossed the finish line in 1:22:07 having logged just 11.65 miles—a discrepancy first noticed by MarathonInvestigation.com. She initially denied any cheating, according to the blogger, and went so far as to cycle the remaining distance to cover up her tracks.
"Jane made a series of very bad decisions. From cutting the course, denying it initially, accepting the 2nd place award, covering her tracks, and not fully owning up to it," the site said.
Seo posted an apology to her now-deleted Instagram account, admitting to cheating during the race. She blamed the cheating scandal on a physical ailment.
"I wasn't feeling well so I CUT THE COURSE and headed to the finish line," she said in a screengrab of the post captured by the Daily Mail. "I got swept away in the moment and pretended I ran the entire course, when in fact I CHEATED and should have DISQUALIFIED myself…[and] also proceeded to BIKE the course afterward with my GPS watch to cover my wrongdoings."
Marathon officials eventually disqualified her from the event after confronting her with the information. They indicated that she would be allowed to participate in future events after coming clean and apologizing for the incident.
"She is hurting. She accepts the consequences," the race's official Facebook account said. "Life is about second chances. I have moved on, and suggest the same for everyone."
Mozilla always intended for Rust to be used in building key parts of the Firefox browser. Now the company is committing to that vision in a significant manner.
After version 53, Firefox will require Rust to compile successfully, due to the presence of Firefox components built with the language. But this decision may restrict the number of platforms that Firefox can be ported to—for now.

Rust, Mozilla Research's language for fast and safe system-level programming, is on the eve of a new release. Rust 1.15's most notable new feature is a revamped build system written in Rust and using Rust's native Cargo package management. Previously, Rust was built with makefiles; with this change, Rust can be built using Cargo “crates” like any other Rust project. It's one of many steps that Rust has taken toward becoming its own ecosystem, not dependent on pieces built by others.
As Rust has matured and stabilized, it's become easier for Firefox developers to move more of the browser's critical infrastructure to that language. But there's a downside: Any platform where you intend to build and run Firefox will need a working edition of the Rust compiler.
Rust is meant to be cross-platform, so this should be possible. However, the practical implications are more complex. Rust depends on LLVM, which has dependencies of its own—and all of them would need to be supported on the target platform.
A discussion on the Bugzilla tracker for Firefox raises many of these points. Other concerns also bubbled up: What about proper support for Linux distributions with long-term support, where the tools available on the distro are often frozen, and where newer Rust features might not be available? What about support for Firefox on "non-tier-1" platforms, which make up a smaller share of Firefox users?
Mozilla's stance is that in the long run, the pain of transition will be worth it. "The advantage of using Rust is too great,” according to maintainer Ted Mielczarek. “We normally don't go out of our way to make life harder for people maintaining Firefox ports, but in this case we can't let lesser-used platforms restrict us from using Rust in Firefox,” he wrote.
The platforms most likely to be affected by this decision, according to a discussion in the Bugzilla thread, are nondesktop architectures like IBM's S390. As a result, it's possible that those who ship Linux distributions for those architectures—as Red Hat does with Fedora—will simply drop Firefox support for the builds that do not yet fully support Rust.
Most Firefox users won't be affected by this. The best hope for those who are, will be to marshal efforts to build out whatever platforms need Rust support—simultaneously driving development for both Firefox and Rust.
Conventional Firefox users, though, care more about the end result—a promised rejuvenation that will keep the browser speedy and feature-competitive—and less about the technology used to accomplish it. The pressure's on not only to move to Rust, but to prove the move was worth it.

To fully know a species and develop sound conservation efforts, its full life cycle must be understood. But tracking small migratory birds for thousands of miles has proven challenging, if not impossible, in the past. However, using new and minute technology, Smithsonian scientists have, for the first time ever, tracked one of North America's rarest birds―the Kirtland's warbler―throughout its full annual cycle, revealing new and critical information for the bird's future. The team's research is published in the Jan 20 issue of the Journal of Avian Biology.
Each year billions of birds worldwide migrate to their breeding or wintering grounds, stopping along the way to eat and rest. But where do they stop? How long do they rest? What exact paths do they fly? For many species, the answers are not well known, but for the Kirtland's warbler (Setophaga kirtlandii), things have become a bit clearer.
“However difficult it may be, it is critical that we understand the full annual cycle of birds, not just where they breed,” said Nathan Cooper, lead author of the study and postdoctoral fellow at the Smithsonian's Migratory Bird Center, part of the Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute. “There is a significant amount of mortality for songbirds that happens during migration, indicating that the conditions birds encounter while migrating are major factors in a species' overall success or failure.”
With an estimated population of more than 2,300 males, the small gray-and-yellow Kirtland's warbler nests almost exclusively in northern Michigan and winters primarily in the Bahamas. The scientists wanted to know how and where the warbler spent the rest of its time between the two areas.
The team went to the bird's breeding range in Michigan and fitted dozens of Kirtland's warblers with miniature archival geolocators―tracking devices that weigh half a gram. The scientists then recaptured the birds the following year to remove the geolocators and examine the information the devices contained.
The data from the geolocators allowed the team to map migration routes for Kirtland's warbler in both spring and fall; record the timing of departure and arrival, as well as the duration of each migration (on average, the birds traveled 1,700 miles in only 16 days); and identify the location and duration of stopovers―several of which were located just before or after large ecological barriers, such as the Appalachian Mountains and the Atlantic Ocean.
The scientists were also able to determine and map the locations where the birds spent the winter. All but one of the birds with geolocators wintered in the Bahamas and Turks and Caicos. The one exception was a male that wintered in Cuba―a location that was previously unknown as part of the species winter range.
“The migratory periods remain the least understood periods for all birds,” said Peter Marra, co-author of the research and head of the Smithsonian's Migratory Bird Center. “But by describing the Kirtland's warbler migration routes and timing and identifying locations of stopover sites, we have begun the process of better understanding the dynamics of their full annual cycle. These data can, in turn, inform conservation priorities for the species.”
The team plans to continue their research, working to more precisely identify the types of habitat and the locations of the birds' stopovers during migration. This information can then be used to protect those areas from disturbance and development.
Kirtland's warbler is one of more than 40 species of warbler in North America. It requires large areas of dense, young jack pine for its breeding habitat. This habitat was historically created by wildfire, but today is primarily created through the harvest of mature jack pine and planting of seedlings. The warblers build cup-shaped nests on the ground and lay four to five eggs. The species' population hit an all-time low in the early 1970s when it plummeted to less than 400 birds. While the population has grown significantly, the Kirtland's warbler is still in dire need of conservation.
The movement to get rid of the electoral college in the United States has a hidden agenda, according to Fox News host Bill O'Reilly: stripping the “white establishment” of power.
In a scripted segment titled Abolishing the Electoral College, O'Reilly goes over his talking points with accompanying graphics that mirror his script.
READ MORE: Why did the polls fail to predict a Donald Trump presidency?
If the electoral college were abolished, he argued, candidates could win the presidency by winning favour in large cities where “minorities are substantial.”
“They know that neutralizing the largely rural areas in the Midwest and South will assure liberal politicians get power and keep it,” said O'Reilly.
WATCH: How do Americans elect their president?
The recent movement to get rid of the electoral college, in place since 1787, was prompted by Hillary Clinton‘s presidential loss despite having a popular vote lead over Donald Trump, he said.
Clinton won more than 2.8 million votes over Trump.

O'Reilly said liberals push the agenda that a system of oppression created by white men must be done away with.
“So-called white privilege — bad. Diversity — good,” O'Reilly said, mockingly.

He went on to suggest Democrats are claiming that dwindling support for their policies among white men is due to racism.
“So that's what's really going on when you hear about the electoral college and how unfair it allegedly is.
“Summing up — the left wants power taken away from the white establishment and they want a profound change in the way America is run. Taking power away from the white precincts is the quickest way to do that,” he said in conclusion.
His comments prompted vitriol, and mockery, online:

Abstract
Background Repeated stress paradigms have been shown to cause devastating alterations on memory functions. Stress is linked with inflammation. Psychological and certain physical stressors could lead to neuroinflammation. Inflammatory process may occur by release of mediators and stimulate the production of prostaglandins through cyclooxygenase (COX). Treatment with COX inhibitors, which restrain prostaglandin production, has enhanced memory in a number of neuroinflammatory states showing a potential function for raised prostaglandins in these memory shortfalls. In the present study, potential therapeutic effects of indomethacin and diclofenac sodium on memory in both unrestraint and restraint rats were observed.
Methods and results Two components, long term memory and short term memory were examined by Morris water maze (MWM) and elevated plus maze (EPM) respectively. The present study also demonstrated the effect of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) on lipid peroxidation (LPO) and activities of antioxidant enzymes along with the activity of acetylcholinesterase (AChE). Results of MWM and EPM showed significant effects of drugs in both unrestraint and restraint rats as escape latency and transfer latency, in respective behavioral models were decreased as compared to that of control. This study also showed NSAIDs administration decreased LPO and increased antioxidant enzymes activity and decreased AChE activity in rats exposed to repeated stress.
Janet Yellen Vice-Chair of the San Francisco Federal Reserve has a big new speech out about how slow this recovery has been, and why.
One of the culprits for the slower recovery?
Fiscal policy.
Specifically? Were not spending enough.
Government spending, which usually provides a boost to the economy in the quarters following the recession, has been a net drag this time because the government is spending less than it normally does.
As this chart shows, in the initial 4 quarters since the start of ths recovery, government spending provided its standard boost to GDP.
But in the 8 quarter and 12 quarter period after that, fiscal policy has been a drag, as spending growth has been a lot slower than in past recoveries.
So yes, spending is the problem. We just need to crank it up.

Jaguars quarterback Blake Bortles' bad 2016 season may have hit a new low on Sunday.
Bortles was intercepted twice by the Broncos and lost a fumble in a 20-10 loss that saw him complete 19-of-42 passes to register the lowest quarterback rating of his career. One of the interceptions was returned for a touchdown, making it three times in the last four weeks that a defense has done that against the Jags.
Bortles has now thrown 15 interceptions and lost four fumbles for the 2-10 Jaguars in a season fit for a horror movie.
“It's the biggest nightmare possible,” Bortles said after Sunday's 20-10 loss to Denver in which he committed three turnovers. “But what are you going to do about it? You can't sit there in a corner and pout. You can't blame people. You can't feel sorry for yourself because I think all that's going to do is affect the way I play.”
Bortles has been dealing with a shoulder injury, but said that wasn't the cause of his problems. The issues have appeared more mechanical and Bortles has brought in outside help during the season in an attempt to get back on track. It hasn't worked and it feels like there's a pretty good chance that it's going to be up to a new coaching staff to correct them come 2017.

MEMPHIS, Tenn. --A 13-year-old girl has died after being shot in a Memphis apartment complex.
Around 7:14 p.m. Monday night, Memphis Police received a shooting call from a tenant at the Corning Village Apartments.
Those apartments are located in the 1400 block of Briercrest Lane.
When investigators arrived they found a 21-year-old man dead with an apparent gunshot wound.
It was initially reported the suspect shot a young girl and then turned the gun on himself.
After speaking with more witnesses on the scene, officers told WREG the girl and the 12-week-old baby were shot by accident.
According to police, two individuals went to an upstairs room in one of the apartments.
While upstairs, a gun accidentally went off.
The bullet went through the floor and hit the girl and baby.
The female was taken to Le Bonheur where she is said to still be in critical condition.
The baby was also taken to the hospital but is expected to be okay.
After the shooting, another person inside the home ran up the stairs to locate the source of the gunfire.
Police said it was that man who shot the 21-year-old as he tried to flee the home.
In the November election, voters will decide whether to approve a $3.5 billion bond for overhauling and repairing BART. The East Bay Times has been editorializing against the bond. Most of what they write is completely loopy. For example, complaining that the costs are not given in year-2065 dollars, or that households would pay more if interest costs were to balloon to 12% (if rates get that high, then the BART bond will be the least of our worries).
There is, however, a kernel of truth in the argument that the bond is back-filling a structural deficit in the maintenance budget. The Times scapegoats the “excessive” worker salaries for this deficit. That is incorrect as the deficit would exist even without recent pay increases. The deficit is the result of two structural problems.
The first problem is the long-term decline in gas tax revenues. For the past two decades, politicians at the State and Federal level have refused to increase the gas-tax. As inflation eats into gas-tax revenues, there has been a big decline in revenue to support transit operations. This has forced BART and other agencies to use creative accounting and borrowing to shore up finances — but that can only go on for so long.
The second problem has to do with the design of BART itself. The low-ridership extensions into far-flung suburbs are a huge drain on finances. Unfortunately, the BART bond exacerbates the problem by providing $350 million for the construction of new parking garages. Subsidizing auto-centric development around the peripheral BART stations is not the solution to the suburban ridership problem.

We're currently working though the budget announcements and stack of material released last week. What's caught our eye are the unbelievable amounts taxpayers are forking out for KiwiRail. On Budget day the Government announced a further $198 million of funding for KiwiRail's Turnaround Plan. That brings the total cost to taxpayers of rail to a whopping $12.2 billion dollars since rail was renationalised in 2008.
Worse, Transport Minister Gerry Brownlee has warned that KiwiRail is likely to need more what the Government is calling a 'turn around plan'.
The $12.2 billion taxpayer money written off on KiwiRail is equivalent to over $2,700 per taxpayer - nearly enough buy every Kiwi a return flight to London.
Per household, the amount is $6,900 - enough to buy a good, reliable second hand car.
The $12.2 billion refers to the total Crown investment of $2.4 billion since 2008 and write downs totalling $9.8 billion.
We've put out a statement calling on the Government to do a U-turn on KiwiRail. At what point will the Government stop throwing good money after bad? Taxpayers should not be burdened with bringing dead rats to life.
It is incredible that for all this money, we still have locomotives with asbestos and ferries that are lemons. We think taxpayers deserve better.

SAN ANTONIO — The sample size remains way too small for Turner NBA analyst and former NBA star Chris Webber to make anything of the Warriors' early-season stumbles. But he already has seen enough to outline something for Warriors forward Kevin Durant.
“He could make his case for best two-way player of the year, even Defensive Player of the Year this year,” Webber said in a recent phone interview.
The numbers back it up. Durant has averaged 2.38 blocks per game, ranking second only behind Utah center Rudy Gobert. The Warriors (5-3) will play the San Antonio Spurs (4-3) in a nationally televised game on Thursday on TNT (5 pm PT) with play-by-play announcer Marv Albert, analyst Mike Fratello and sideline reporter Kristen Ledlow on the call. But Webber has watched plenty of the Warriors, thus season. Below are his thoughts on the team's start, Durant and if the Warriors could be better than even in last season's championship run.
What do you make of the Warriors' start so far?
Webber: “I make it that it's the second week of the season. I laugh at all the experts that panic this early. Coach Kerr said it was all about turnovers, and I think it's that simple. Training camp doesn't matter. Guys play basketball all year round. Anybody that says that matter hasn't been in the body of a basketball player all year round. Guys have better trainers and better one on one coaches. It's not that. It simply comes down to turnovers. That has been their Achilles heel even when they've won championships. Watching him the other night, Steve simplified it to turnovers. I would agree with him.” Related Articles NBA rescinds DeMarcus Cousins' technical vs. Charlotte

With the Warriors about to play the Spurs, where do you see San Antonio in the mix of all the other Western Conference teams?
Webber: “I see the Spurs having just a s favorable chance as anyone to reach the Western Conference Finals. Last year, they were one of the most unathletic teams in the history of Pop's tenure. We saw how that was affected. They were still up 20 [in Game 1 of the 2017 Western Conference Finals], and Kawhi [Leonard] gets injured on a [Zaza] Pachulia closeout. They're right where they always are to me.”
With all the various moves NBA teams made this offseason, which Western Conference team do you think could give the Warriors the most trouble this season?
Webber: “I think every team this year needs to respect every team. If you don't, you're going to get upset. Golden State is a great team, has been together for a while and has a great coach and great system. One of the best players in the league, if not the best in Durant. The rich get richer when you get a guy like Durant, and all that he can do. I think we've seen how important Durant has been to that team. As great as we thought they were, they probably wouldn't have gone back to the Finals without a Durant. I think they played the right way. The shot distribution between the big three on that team has always been pretty equal.
They've had the best defensive team in the last two years. When you look at that and the fact Durant is leading the league in blocked shots, I thought he could make his case for best two-way player of the year, even Defensive Player of the Year this year. I think he's done that if he has some wins behind it. I've seen him as the same team. He has really seen him as the same team, and he has to expect other teams. He has gotten better and they've been able to adjust to all the great things they've been doing. They have to pull a few more tricks out of their bag. Most importantly, not give teams extra possessions and turnovers, and keep an eye on teams in the game.”
What do you see in Durant that makes him a good candidate for Defensive Player of the Year?
Webber: “His size. It's literally what God gave him, his height and his length. Therefore, because he can move laterally and he's seven feet tall, he's not 6'9”. He's seven feet tall. He can check other guys on the rim and use his length. That's part of it. He's a great help defender. He has other good defenders on his team, including a great defender in Draymond. I think he's learned a lot as well. So I'd have to give him all the credit with the effort in, he's to learn to play defensively the right way and he uses his God-given ability to block shots on smaller guards and come over and help on bigger players. It's been fun watching him evolve into a very good two-way player.”
Considering the Warriors have the same core together from last season's championship team, what's your outlook on them being even better this season?
The VBL, much like the VBR, its larger successor, is a light, four-wheeled armored fighting vehicle, designed for multiple roles while offering its crew basic small arms protection. It is a compact machine, capable of great speeds and a wide variety of duties, including reconnaissance, liaison tasks or even armored vehicle killing.
It was developed by Panhard in the late 1980s and its designation stands for Véhicule Blindé Léger (Light Armored Vehicle). In a way it was designed for the "old" type of war – symmetric warfare where units in such vehicles wouldn't be the most common target of enemy attention. The original purpose of the program was to replace the American Jeep vehicles still in French service in the late 1970s and to provide the French army with a light and affordable platform for multiple weapons systems.
VBL armor is very thin – it is STANAG 4569 Level 1, which means it can withstand only small arms non-AP ammunition and grenade blasts. It doesn't protect it from mine blasts and IEDs, something soldiers have to face in today's asymmetric warfare. One incident involving an IED explosion took place on February 27 2013, when a bomb exploded near a VBL driven by two French soldiers in Mali, near Adrar des Ifoghas. One was seriously wounded and the other lightly wounded, but the vehicle was wrecked.
That, however, also means the vehicle is very light. With its 3.5 tons in basic configuration, the VBL can not only be transported by a standard NATO cargo plane (the C-130), but can also be carried by a transport helicopter or even (if the situation requires it) dropped by a parachute. Unlike other vehicles of this type, it is also amphibious and its swimming speed can reach 5 km/h.
Once on the ground, it can also go rather fast thanks to its 95hp Peugeot XD3T turbo-diesel engine. Its maximum speed on hardened surfaces is around 95 km/h (average speed is 70 km/h), although the heavier variants are a little bit slower. The specialized sub-types include:
Light recon vehicle armed with a machinegun or a 40mm grenade launcher
Heavy recon vehicle armed with a remote controlled automatic cannon (20mm Rheinmetall or even 30mm), capable of engaging light enemy armor
Command and Communications vehicle with prolonged hull and advanced communication systems
Anti-tank variants with several weapon system options, such as the AT4CS, MILAN, ERYX or even TOW (for export)
NBC recon vehicle
Urban combat variant AZUR (stands for Action en Zone Urbaine)
Anti-Aircraft variant armed with MISTRAL surface-to-air missiles
Overall, around two dozen variants of the VBL have been proposed.
The VBL was accepted in French service in 1990 and has found its way to around 20, mostly African, countries. It's a very popular export item thanks to its ruggedness and versatility. The biggest operators include France (approximately 1400 in service), Greece, and Oman. All in all, around 2400 were built. Over the years, the VBLs in French service were mostly involved in peacekeeping operations for the United Nations, such as those in former Yugoslavia, Lebanon and Somalia, but some saw service in Mali, the Ivory Coast and Afghanistan. The Nigerians used VBLs in counter-insurgency operations as light fighting vehicles (the recon variant armed with a Browning M2 .50 caliber heavy machinegun).
In Armored Warfare
The VBL, much like the Fox and the CRAB, is one of the lightest and least armored but also the fastest vehicles of Armored Warfare. It is the quintessential Tier 6 scout and few other vehicles can match its speed, agility and acceleration.
There are two weapon options for the VBL – either a 20mm autocannon, or an ALRRT-4M INGWE missile launcher. Each weapons system is designed for a different playstyle. The missile launcher requires more passive scouting, such as staying hidden behind an obstacle and ambushing the enemy using the long viewrange when standing.
The automatic cannon is best used for active and aggressive reconnaissance and for engaging targets at close distances. Even Main Battle Tanks can be defeated by flanking them and firing into their exposed rear areas.
The VBL is an extremely deadly vehicle in capable hands, regardless of configuration. Its tiny size makes it difficult to hit, while its mobility allows it to flank even wary opponents.

Apparently, not all the Arctic is warming to script. This is an interesting graph from PICES, titled The Bering Sea: Current Status and Recent Events.
It is accompanied by this text:
Normally, a moderate El Niño (as in winter 2010) would have resulted in a warmer Bering Sea and La Niña in winter 2011, and weakening in spring would have supported cooler conditions. However, in recent years it appears that the location of the Aleutian Low had more influence on the Bering Sea in 2010 and 2011 than did the intensity of the low or the ENSO connection.
Additionally, the report suggests the ecosystem of the Bering sea is not so bad after all, with plankton and fish volume on the rise.
There's too much to reproduce here, read the entire article at PICES here:

Security checkpoint gun seizures are at a three-year high for Denver International Airport, which sits third nationally for firearm recoveries.
Through the middle of December, 99 guns were confiscated by the Transportation Security Administration at DIA, eclipsing the 70 discovered at the airport in 2014 and 51 in 2013.
Only Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport and Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport have surpassed seizures at Denver's airport this year.
“I can't speculate on why passengers continue to bring firearms to the checkpoint at DIA and airports across the nation,” said Carrie Harmon, a TSA spokeswoman.
Harmon said TSA works hard to communicate to passengers that firearms are not allowed, finding that most passengers caught with a weapon say they forgot the firearm was in their bags.
“These items are only allowed in checked bags, if declared to the airline and properly packed,” Harmon said. “Firearms must be packed in a locked, hard-sided container.”
Passengers found with a gun can face a civil penalty up to $11,000. The average penalty for a loaded firearm is $3,000, according to the TSA, and the average penalty for an unloaded firearm is $1,500.
Federal officials encourage passengers to check airline and TSA rules and restrictions before they head to the airport.
DIA ranked fifth nationally in firearm seizures in 2013 and 2014, according to TSA data.
So far this year, 2,633 guns have been seized at the nation's airports. In 2014, the agency confiscated an average of six guns per day.
Denver security officials have also found other prohibited items on passengers, including an inert grenade discovered in September that prompted an evacuation.
Heath Montgomery, a spokesman for DIA, says Denver's air hub is the fifth- busiest in the country and has the 17th most passengers of the world's airports.
“Last year was a record-setter with 53.4 million passengers,” Montgomery added. “We are on track to possibly beat that this year.”

Turns out The Walking Dead's Negan can't whack everything in his path.
Supernatural exec producer Andrew Dabb tells TVLine that Jeffrey Dean Morgan's relatively new status as one of TV's biggest evildoers ever does not preclude his potential return as Sam and Dean's pa, John Winchester.
“I don't really worry about that because by the time he comes back, I'm sure [Supernatural] will have been on for 20 seasons at that point, and The Walking Dead will be long over,” he says with a laugh before noting that “Jeffrey's an amazing actor… He plays such a great bad guy. But at the same time… if you give him really good material, he can go back to being someone we know and love and someone we can empathize with.
“I have full faith in him as an actor,” the EP adds, “and I'm excited to see [him return as John] if it ever comes to pass.”
Should you need a reminder that, in addition to a bat-wielding menace, Morgan can also play “a caring, loving father,” Dabb suggests you go back and rewatch Supernatural's Season 2 premiere, in which John “sacrifices his life” to save Dean. However, Dabb is quick to point out that John also has some darkness in him — although it's hardly Negan-level dark. “John would not win Father of the Year,” he notes. “He was a guy who was haunted by his own demons.” (Reporting by Vlada Gelman)
City councillor Jim Karygiannis (open Jim Karygiannis's policard) said he will likely introduce a motion at next month's council meeting to have the popular car-hailing app Uber removed from city-owned Smartphones. “I wouldn't feel safe if my daughter or my wife were to get in (an) Uber cab with some of the stuff that has happened with the Uber drivers,” Karygiannis said. “There's no insurance. There's no public safety as far as police (background checks) are concerned.”

The motion asks the city's Chief Administrative Officer to remove the app from 12,000 city-issued phones, though Karygiannis does not know how many of those phones have actually downloaded the app. His action comes days after 13 UberX drivers were charged with operating a taxi without the proper licence or insurance in an undercover sting operation, leaving drivers who use the Smartphone app feeling besieged. “It's bad enough what police are doing,” said one UberX driver who asked not to be identified for fear of legal repercussions. “There's a huge demand for (Uber); why be a hypocrite about it?”

“Police should put something out and say you can't do it, if that's the case. Uber says there's no regulation. People are confused and no one understands the law,” he told two-Star reporters on a recent ride. “I'm all for regulation — tell me what I need to do.” A draft of Karygiannis' motion provided to the Star also requests that the city's mobile service providers “remove or block the application in an automated manner.” Karygiannis would not speculate on the likelihood of his motion passing in council, but said it makes no sense for city staff to be using Uber while the city battles the controversial company in court. It was the robbery of an UberX driver in February that prompted a platoon of young Toronto police officers to begin planning the recent sting operation, said 12 Division superintendent Scott Weidmark.
Police set up at two Tim Hortons in the city's west end and ordered an UberX car to take them from one to the other. Upon arrival, the UberX drivers were greeted with flashing lights and the passenger would identify himself as a police officer, Weidmark said. Each of the drivers was charged with operating a taxi without the proper licence or insurance.

“That's maybe one of the gaps within this service right now. Not only do their drivers not have the same protection as a regular cab would, there's little regulation on whom these drivers are,” he said, citing foreign cases of UberX drivers with criminal records. “We have concerns for both ends: the drivers and the public.” But the UberX driver who spoke to the Star says many of his clients have stopped using regular taxis altogether and consider Uber to provide a better, more convenient experience with more accountability. “The city and Uber need to sit down and talk to each other,” he said. “There's more than enough business to go around — especially with the PanAm Games coming.” Weidmark said in addition to the 11 UberX drivers who were in court this week, two more have been charged, but that the crackdown is over for now. “It really all depends on where Uber is going to go in the province of Ontario, in the city. If they can find some way of regulating it, I think there's a benefit to it. But the unregulated drivers and the lack of protection for the drivers and the passengers is a real problem right now,” he said.

TOO MANY, TOO MUCH?: In an exclusive report, CNN takes viewers to the California desert where some 2,000 M-1 Abrams tanks are sitting, unused, because the U.S. military has no need for them.
In what turned out to be a controversial move, the U.S. Army told Congress that it can hold off on refurbishing or building any tanks for three years, saving the country $3 billion (not a significant share of the defense budget by any means, but still…).
Nonetheless, in April, 173 members of the House from both parties wrote a letter to Defense Secretary Leon Panetta urging him to continue producing more tanks, according to CNN.
General Dynamics, which makes the tanks, is one of OpenSecrets.org's Heavy Hitters, spending millions on campaign contributions and lobbying each year.
In 2011 the company spent $11 million on lobbying, and with $5 million spent in the first half on this year it's on track to match that.
The General Dynamics PAC had spent $1.5 million on this election by mid-2012, contributing slightly more to Republicans than Democrats. Recipients of the PAC money were many — 212 congressional and 21 senatorial candidates, with the most going to House Armed Services Committee Chairman Buck McKeon (R-Calif.), GOP presidential candidate Mitt Romney, Sen. Scott Brown (R-Mass.), Rep. Jim Langevin (D-R.I.) and Sen. Olympia Snowe (R-Maine).
COURTING EDUCATION ISSUES: The Supreme Court heard arguments for and against affirmative action Wednesday in a case that could reshape universities' admissions policies.
In the case, Fisher v. University of Texas, the plaintiff claimed she had been denied admission to the University of Texas on the basis of her race (white).
Like many other large universities, the University of Texas is well-represented in Washington. The school spent $420,000 lobbying in the first half of this year, especially on education — frequently in connection with immigrants — as well as health care issues. The disclosure forms don't show the university lobbying on anything connected to affirmative action.
Employees from the University of Texas have favored Barack Obama in this election cycle. The education industry is Obama's second-largest contributor after lawyers and law firms.
RIDERSHIP RECORD ON RAILS: Amtrak announced that it carried more than 31.2 million passengers this year, breaking records for ridership.
House Republicans spent the last year railing against the train system and the approximately $1 billion in subsidies it receives every year.
Yet in spite of Republicans' anti-Amtrak stance, the railroad industry tends to favor the GOP with its campaign contributions. In the 2012 cycle, it has given $3 million to Republicans in Congress compared to $1.8 million to Democrats.
Amtrak employees themselves almost exclusively have given to Democrats in this cycle, contributing just $250 to a single Republican.

Some of the Canadian military's top equipment programs – including projects to buy new maritime helicopters and Arctic patrol vessels – will see their funding delayed as the Defence Department tries to deal with the Liberal government's recently announced budget.
The budget, released in late March, calls for $3.7 billion in spending on equipment to be delayed until 2021 or later.
But details provided to the Ottawa Citizen by the Department of National Defence outline how even key military equipment programs just getting underway are not being spared – money is also not available until years from now for those projects. They include:
 Arctic Offshore Patrol Ships ($173 million)
 Future Fighter aircraft (CF-18 replacement – $109 million)
 Cyclone maritime helicopter ($90 million)
 Halifax Class modernization and Frigate Life Extension ($71.1 million)
 Integrated Soldier System Project ($39.4 million).
Another $2.6 billion in equipment funding – not yet earmarked for specific gear – will also be withheld until 2021 or beyond.
It is unclear how some of the programs, such as the Cyclone maritime helicopters which are now being delivered, might be affected by the temporary removal of funding from their budgets. In addition, construction has already begun on the Arctic Offshore Patrol Ships, with the first ship to be in the water by 2018.
Defence sources have suggested that the government could account for the $3.7 billion by delaying or cutting back on buying spare parts or other equipment for the ongoing projects, or delaying the arrival of some of the equipment.
Defence analyst Martin Shadwick said he was surprised that active programs were being targeted in the budget process. He noted that the Cyclones are supposed to be replacing the air force's aging Sea King helicopters, a contract originally signed under Liberal Prime Minister Paul Martin in 2004. “One possibility is that the Sea Kings will have to keep flying longer,” said Shadwick, who teaches strategic studies at York University in Toronto. “Or maybe systems that were supposed to be added to the aircraft won't be.”
In some cases, the equipment projects are relatively new. In late July the Conservative government announced that it had awarded an initial contract to Quebec-based Rheinmetall Canada Inc. to provide gear for the integrated soldier system project. That project aims to outfit soldiers with improved communications and computer equipment that can be worn on the battlefield.
Defence sources say the budget decision could affect later portions of the project.
In other cases, such as the recently upgraded Halifax-class frigates, the Canadian navy had planned a series of follow-on enhancements to keep the ships sailing until they can be replaced starting sometime after 2026.
During the election the Liberals promised to immediately launch a project to buy replacement aircraft for the CF-18s.
But the CF-18 fighter replacement project is one of the areas where spending is being delayed, indicating that it won't move as quickly as the Liberals originally claimed, noted Shadwick.
Finance Minister Bill Morneau has insisted that moving the funding to a later date does not mean the defence budget is being cut.
The Liberal government recently launched a review to figure out the country's defence priorities. That is expected to be ready sometime in early 2017.
In the meantime, government officials say the DND won't be in a position to spend the $3.7 billion until well into the future.
“In order to make sure we have the funds available at the time when they need those funds, we've reprofiled some in the fiscal framework,” Morneau told journalists after he tabled the budget. “So, when we need the money, the money will be in the fiscal framework. So, we believe that is the appropriate action to take to ensure our military has the appropriate equipment, the planes and the ships they need.”
Some analysts, however, have voiced concern the $3.7 billion won't be returned to the DND.
Ashley Lemire, a DND spokeswoman, noted in an email, “some major projects experienced delays in their original timelines, which resulted in funds needing to be moved forward to future years.”
“The $3.7 billion in capital investment space represents only a shift in funding and there is no directed budget cut to the defence budget, as the funds will be left in the reserve to be requested in future years, when required,” she added.
But former Chief of the Defence Staff Rick Hillier told the Ottawa Citizen that the Canadian military is “fragile” after years of budget cuts and delayed equipment purchases.
But he was “disturbed” by the Liberal government's decision last month to withhold $3.7 billion that had been earmarked for new military equipment.
That measure continued a trend started under the Conservatives.
“(The government) said it'll come back later,” Hillier said. “I never believed that as chief of defence staff. If it's not in the fiscal framework, it's not there. So that's a $4-billion cut that occurred. That came mostly out of the acquisition capital funding, where we desperately need to spend even more.”
Short Story
My wristwatch was stuck at half past two, even though the morning sun indicated otherwise. Most people would get a battery, reset the time and move on with their day. But I had old superstitions rattling around in my head, a legacy of my Nana's myriad household warnings and omens–like if your right palm itched you were going to get money, if you got your stomach wet while you washed dishes you'd marry a drunk, or if you sang at the table you'd marry a crazy person. And if a clock stopped, someone was going to die.
“Just put a new battery in it, for crissakes,” my boyfriend Stuart said when he caught me regarding the watch with the kind of revulsion I reserved for cockroaches and cigarette butts.
I talked him into going to the jewelry store with me. We followed the empty footpath around the lake to town. It was one of those dark November days, stark trees against a sky blanketed in grey clouds, wind whipping up dried leaves into clattering funnels. A duck swam across the rippled water, flapping its wings. I pulled the thick wool of my jacket snug across my chest, and wondered if it would rain.
“My mom called,” he said.
If Stuart wanted to pick a topic to take my mind off of Nana's superstitions, he could not have chosen a better one. We never failed to argue about his mother. I've watched Stuart try to rescue her from herself since we were kids. She was the kind of person who thought the world owed her a good time, so every day was a disappointment. I supposed drinking cheap bourbon out of plastic tumblers compensated somehow, or at least made the time pass.
But in the name of harmony, I bit back the question “What kind of trouble is she in now?” and made one of those “mmm” sounds.
“She got laid off,” he said, glancing sideways at me.
She only started working again two weeks ago, I thought. Even for her that had to be record.
“She'll get unemployment, then?”
“That's not the point, Kelsey. I'm worried about her. She spends too much time alone in that trailer. No one comes to visit her anymore. She didn't even get any trick or treaters at last month.”
The kids were probably scared to go there. See, Sherri's trailer didn't need to be decorated special for Halloween. It already had the requisite cobwebs, rickety steps and general disrepair of a haunted-looking trailer, every day of the year.
“She wants me to move back in with her.”
Enough. The words spilled out of me like sleet from the sky.
“No way. Bad idea. You love living in your own apartment. And being around her isn't going to help you stay sober,” I said.
“She's hit the bottom. She said so herself. And she needs my help. How can I say no to that?”
“She can do what you did and dig herself out. Pour the bourbon down the sink, go to AA meetings and get a sponsor, and do the work herself.”
Stuart's silence went on so long I thought maybe I'd gone too far, but when I glanced at him he was studying the footpath like we were on a tight rope and he didn't want to take one wrong step. I quieted the chatter in my head so it wouldn't continue to come out of my mouth, and concentrated on the moment. I felt the metal watch in my long sweater's pocket hit my upper thigh with every step. I listened to the sound of dried leaves skittering across the grass. I watched my breath form clouds in the air. After a while, I took his hand and squeezed, relieved when he squeezed back and smiled.
In the distance, a muddy black truck rounded the corner and rumbled toward us.
“She has to admit she has a problem,” Stuart said. “Until then…” He shook his head slowly, eyes still on the ground.
Ahead, the truck wove sharply onto the shoulder before jerking back between the yellow lines for another twenty feet, then lurching back to the shoulder. Sun glare on the windshield blocked my view of the driver. Stuart, oblivious, continued to stare at his shoes hitting the dirt path. Something wasn't right, I thought. The driver was texting or drunk or maybe both.
“Stuart!” I shouted, but it only made him look at me, not at the danger ahead. And the truck had sped up. I yanked his hand, which sent him sprawling toward me and out of the truck's path. The horn screamed at us as the driver shook his fist at us and drove by, as though we had been in his way. Then, the shrill squeal of brakes on pavement followed by a loud crash.
I was down, my head on the grass, the pain in my hip so sharp I couldn't breathe for a moment. Stuart stood above me, stunned, and pulled me to my feet.
Stuart ran toward the wreck, and I followed behind, slowly, my hip crying out with every step. The truck had smashed head-on into a maple tree. The front end of the truck had folded onto the windshield, and a pair of thick, denim-clad legs were visible through the open driver's side door.
When I got close enough, I saw the blood on the steering wheel and heard a terrible gurgling, but Stuart blocked me from looking at the driver's face.
“It's pretty bad,” was all Stuart said. I saw a beer can on its side between the brake pedal and his brown work boot. The smell of beer wafted to me over cold air.
“Could have easily been you that got hit, instead of that tree,” one of the cops who came later told us. “Kind of cold day for a walk, ain't it?”
We wouldn't have been out at all except for that stupid wristwatch stopping, I thought. I pulled it out of my pocket and looked at its face, now as cracked as the truck's windshield. I must have landed on it when I fell. And I watched as the minute hand ticked forward.

Image Curve's Manifesto
Electric car manufacturer Tesla Motors has released all its patents to the public domain in a bid to accelerate development of electric vehicle technology.
In a blog post Thursday, CEO Elon Musk wrote that Tesla has removed the patents from the wall at the company's Palo Alto headquarters in the spirit of the open source movement.
“Tesla Motors was created to accelerate the advent of sustainable transport. If we clear a path to the creation of compelling electric vehicles, but then lay intellectual property landmines behind us to inhibit others, we are acting in a manner contrary to that goal. Tesla will not initiate patent lawsuits against anyone who, in good faith, wants to use our technology,” he wrote in the posting.
Musk said Tesla took out the patents because it feared big car companies would copy its technology, but then discovered the traditional motor industry was not moving swiftly into this area.
“At best, the large automakers are producing electric cars with limited range in limited volume. Some produce no zero emission cars at all,” he said.
Musk pointed to the role the electric car could play in addressing the amount of greenhouse gases released into the air, if enough of them were made to replace vehicles that burn fossil fuels.
“Given that annual new vehicle production is approaching 100 million per year and the global fleet is approximately two billion cars, it is impossible for Tesla to build electric cars fast enough to address the carbon crisis,” he said.
“ By the same token, it means the market is enormous. Our true competition is not the small trickle of non-Tesla electric cars being produced, but rather the enormous flood of gasoline cars pouring out of the world's factories every day.”
Tesla is maker of the $70,000 US Model S, an electric car that has been widely adopted but ran into problems last year when footage hit YouTube of a Tesla on fire. There were 6,900 Model S cars sold in the first quarter after their release.
The company has released the car in Canada, moved into the U.K. in June and also has plans for China.
Tesla says it wants to encourage talented engineers from around the world to work to improve batteries and other electric car technology.
At the beginning of this year, Tesla had 203 patents covering batteries and other key features. The earliest any of Tesla's current patents expires is 2026, so the Palo Alto, California is relinquishing a potentially valuable long-term advantage.
Stifel analyst James Albertine says the announcement signals Tesla is open to collaboration as it ramps up production. It currently makes one vehicle, the Model S sedan.
Most people who have been directing for a while have a shorthand way of communicating with their DP. For example, you will typically hear a director say “We'll start Wide then move into an OTS and then a CU.” Film crews have most likely done these setups a few hundred times and know how to work efficiently to give you what you want. Despite what a lot of people think about the process, you're not inventing the wheel. Most work on set isn't creative, it's functional. Like a well oiled military operation. Film sets need to run quickly, so before you ever get on set, you need to have thought out each and every shot you will need to get. In this post I have put together some of the more essential shots filmmakers can use to quickly and effectively communicate with their crew and tell their story.
1. Establishing Shot
Normally the first shot the audience sees, establishing shots can take on many forms. In most of the examples in the video, we are looking at aerial shots. Just think of how many films start with an aerial shot going over water, or flying over a city. The main purpose of the establishing shot is to give us a sense of place or tone.
Establishing shots don't necesarily have to be at the beginning of a film, as we see in this classic aerial shot from Shawshank Redemption.
Another type of establishing shot has become more en vogue in recent years. The title sequence from Fight Club is a perfect example. To show that it's not just about coming from the outside in, this establishing shot starts in and moves out of Edward Norton's brain.
2. Extreme Wide Shot (EWS)
Extreme Wide Shots are typically used to show a character in his environment, often very small. There are many different uses for the extreme wide shot, but mostly it is about context. Where is our character? It can be used to comic effect, for example, showing an extreme close-up and then suddenly going to an extreme wide shot to show just how insignificant a character is. Or how powerless he is. It can also be a purely functional way to show size, for example the Millenium Falcon beside the Death Star.
3. Long Shot (LS) or Wide Shot (WS)
A shot in which the full body of a character or object is seen. Closer than an establishing shot.
4. Medium Shot (MS)
Halfway between a long shot and a close-up, the Medium Shot is probably the most common framing for dialog.
5. Close-Up (CU)
There is no hiding in a close-up shot of a character. We feel their naked emotion. Unlike a medium shot, a close-up normally fills the frame with one actor without anything between them and the camera. A close-up allows the viewer to really focus on a characters actions and responses in a scene.
6. Extreme Close Up (ECU)
Extreme close-ups are a great way to create stylized transitions or to give an extreme hyper focus to something. Jonathan Demme uses close-up shots of flashes in The Silence of the Lambs to jar the viewer. This technique has also been used a lot by Edgar Wright and P.T. Anderson to create kinetic transitions as seen below.
7. Pan
A pan gives us the feeling that we are simply turning around and capturing all of the information in a scene in real time. One way to effectively use the pan is if things change state as we pan. For example, a scene might change from night to day, or a character or characters may suddenly appear. A great use of panning was done recently in The Revenant when, as we pan around we can see in real time as Native Americans attack in the distance. Then we pan around again to the boat being hit with arrows. It also builds suspense of not knowing what is on the other end of the pan. (Yes, I know this was a steadicam shot, but it's also a pan while moving through the scene)
In this scene from blowout, Brian De Palma masterfully uses the pan as a way to show the passage of time.
8. Zoom
“Never ever ever use the zoom!” This was something my early cinematography teacher told me. Of course, it's ok the use the zoom, but only when you should. It should definitely not be used as a substitute for a dolly. It just looks cheap. But zooming definitely has its place. I mean, if it's good enough for Kubrick, what can I say. There are many different ways to zoom. One technique you see a lot lately is zooming in visual effects. You know, that show of the Millenium falcon where the virtual camera suddenly zooms in a little. You see that all over the place now and Avatar does it during nearly every shot of a ship or flying creature.
Zooms do feel kind of B-Movie, but that doesn't mean they're ineffective. Check out some of Stanley Kubrick's zooms from The Shining.
And then of course, Francis Ford Coppola's use of the zoom to give a sense of voyeurism.
9. Static Shot
Locking off a camera and not allowing it to move can cause some filmmakers to start sweating. One of the biggest traps we can fall into as directors is the idea that we have to show all the cool tricks we know. But just like some of the best actors know when doing nothing works best, the best directors know when simply putting a camera on a tripod will work best. Static shots can have immense power. In many ways similar to the dolly shot, the static shot forces us to really pay attention to what is going on in a scene. We are no longer participants in the world. We are watching through a direct window into another world. Actors might come in and out of frame, but the camera sits still. This creates a hyper realism which is similar in tone to the overused security cam footage you see in a lot of movies. With the knowledge that something worth watching was caught on tape, you work harder to figure out what is happening in the frame, rather than being told.
Yorgos Lanthimos is the master of the locked off camera as shown in his film Kynodontas.
10. Crane Shot
The one place I see crane shots now all the time are on shows like The Tonight Show, where they want to create a sense of excitement and energy. Using a crane or a jib is a very fast way to make your film look more professional. Jibs are now pretty common on film sets because it allows you a freedom to move the camera that you don't have with a simple dolley. Another way to use a crane shot is to start a scene close on a subject and then pull back to see what they are reacting to. One of the best examples of this was Gone With The Wind. We start with a close up of Scarlet, and then move slowly upward and back to an extreme wide shot of the thousands of soldiers lying on the ground.
Cranes can also be used simply to move the camera around a set without cutting as is done with the Max Ophüls classic Le Plaisir.
11. Dutch Angle
The Dutch Angle is a very stylized way to show that something in scene is just a little off.
12. Point of View (POV)
Typically showing the exact visual perspective of a character. In the case of Halloween, seeing from the perspective of the killer builds tension in the scene. This is also used in Terminator to show the way his mechanical brain processes information.
As many of you know, the film Hardcore Henry is shot completely as a POV shot. Here's the trailer. It's a bit violent so you've been warned.
13. Tracking Shots and Long Takes
This kind of shot can take many forms. The linking factor is that the camera catches events in real time without any cuts. This is often in the form of a tracking shot, but has taken on many different forms. One of the most famous films in recent memory Birdman, which is an entire film that takes place over what seems to be one long take.
14. Whip Pan
15. Low Angle Shot
Citizen Kane is really a film school unto itself, but one thing that is striking about Welles' use of camera angles is how far he would go to get these amazing low angles. In many cases he would have to dig out the floors to get the camera low enough. So, the big question is Why? Why was it so important to shoot these scenes looking up at the actors. Many have speculated that it was to give the viewer a sense of claustrophobia. Although you would think the ceiling would make characters appear big, in this scene it definitely feels like the ceiling is closing in on the two actors.
On the other hand, it is clear in Star Wars that the low angle that is always on Darth Vader is meant to show his power in the scene. In almost every scene he is shot from below making his 6'4 frame that much more intimidating.
16. High Angle Shot
The opposite of the low angle shot. It should kind of go without saying, but this makes your actor seem very small. Or possibly that their up against a very difficult obstacle.
17. Over the Shoulder (OTS)
18. Cutaway Shots
Cutaway shots are used to show different parts of a full 360 degree scenes. These scenes are used by the editor for a variety of reasons. A cut in can be used to show what a character is responding to. Or simply to focus the eye on various aspects within a scene, like someone that is so subtle it wouldn't necessarily register with a medium shot. Cutaway shots are also a good way to hide an edit. Dov Simens used to joke that in every film there was a cutaway shot of a dog in order to hide a cut. So always have a cute dog somewhere in the scene you can cover a bad line.
19. Aerial Shot
A few years ago, shooting an aerial shot would have cost thousands. But now, with the advent of drone cinematography, you can have extremely professional results for very little. For just a few thousand bucks you can shoot amazing aerial photography of your scene that stands up to any of the latest blockbusters. Of course, if you need to do anything more complicated that just flying through the air, you will most likely need to find an experienced drone operator.
20. The Floating Dolly Shot
I know this shot wasn't invented by Spike Lee, but he has certainly made it famous. Watch the video below to see what I mean. In this shot, a character is on the same dolly with the camera and appears to float through the scene. It's a very effective way capture a moment in the film where the characters are daydreaming or floating through a moment. I always remember the moment in Malcolm X when he is slowly floating down the street with the camera, aware of his possible fate getting closer.
Now, lets review…

A phishing campaign currently in circulation is attempting to bait World of Warcraft with the promise of free in-game pets. We've seen two variations on this so far, and it's possible there's more. Both of the below examples lead to the same phishing URL. As great as the promise of some free content is, this is nothing more than an attempt at stealing your gaming credentials.
One of the emails read as follows:

To claim your gift, enter your Gift Key on the Battle.net? Account Management. You'll be sent to the download page afterwards, if needed.
The second mail claims a “WoW mount mystic rune sabre” is up for grabs.
Keen Warcraft players will notice the email is branded with Battle(dot)net, the name of Blizzard's online gaming service – but this name has just been retired, which may well set off a few alarm bells.
Both emails lead to a phish located at (deep breath):

Ken Leung has been cast in ABC's “Marvel's Inhumans,” Variety has learned. The “Lost” alum will play Karnak, based on the character from the comics.
“Marvel's Inhumans” will explore the never-before-told epic adventure of the royal family including Black Bolt, the enigmatic, commanding king of the Inhumans, with a voice so powerful that the slightest whisper can destroy a city.
Leung's character Karnak is Black Bolt's cousin and closest advisor. His gift is an ability to see the fault in all things — people, plans, structures, everything. He's Black Bolt's most ardent supporter and strategist and is often seen as the royal family's planner and philosopher.
“Ken brings both a wisdom and a power to the role that no one else could match. His Karnak will be awesome,” said Marvel head of television and executive producer, Jeph Loeb.
Showrunner and executive producer Scott Buck added, “Ken Leung has great natural intelligence that reads clearly and will add depth and complexity to the very complicated character of Karnak.”
Previously announced, Black Bolt will be played by Anson Mount, known from “Hell on Wheels.” Other case members in the drama are “Game of Thrones” star Iwan Rheon who will play Black Bolt's younger brother, Maximus the Mad, and Serinda Swan, who will play the queen, Medusa.

“Marvel's Inhumans” is based on the classic Marvel comic book characters created in 1965 by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby. Jim Chory will serve as executive producer, along with Loeb and Buck, and Roel Reine will direct the first two episodes. Marvel Television and ABC Studios are co-producing.
A version of the first two episodes will debut in IMAX theaters this September, prior to the TV premiere in fall, which will span eight episodes for the first season.
Aside from “Lost,” Leung starred on NBC's “The Night Shift.” The medical drama has been renewed for a fourth season, but Leung will not return — prior to being cast in “Marvel's Inhumans,” he opted out of his contract on the NBC series to pursue other opportunities. He also recently appeared in “Star Wars: The Force Awakens.” His other credits include “Person of Interest,” “Zero Hour” and “Deception.”
Excel Saga (Japanese: エクセル♥サーガ, Hepburn: Ekuseru Sāga) is a manga series written and illustrated by Kōshi Rikudō. It was serialized in Young King OURs from 1996 to 2011, and its individual chapters were collected and published in tankōbon volumes by Shōnen Gahōsha. The series follows the attempts of Across, a "secret ideological organization", to conquer the city of Fukuoka as a first step towards world domination. The title character of the series, Excel, is a key member of the group who is working towards completing this goal, while the city is being defended by a shadowy government agency led by Dr. Kabapu.
The manga was adapted into an anime television series by Victor Entertainment, which was taglined Quack Experimental Animation (へっぽこ実験アニメーション, Heppoko Jikken Animēshon). Directed by Shinichi Watanabe and featuring animation from J.C.Staff, the series premiered on TV Tokyo in 1999. TV Tokyo only aired twenty-five of the series' twenty-six episodes, with the finale having been intentionally made too violent, obscene and long for broadcast on Japanese TV. As such, it was only included in the DVD release of the series, although it has since been broadcast in other markets.
The series has enjoyed some critical success coupled with respectable sales.
Plot [ edit ]
Believing the World to be corrupt, the secret organization Across plans to conquer the world. The first step in the plan for world domination is to begin by focusing on one city in order to minimize setbacks. Across consists of the leader of the organization, Il Palazzo, and his young adult officers: the enthusiastic and energetically devoted Excel and the soft-spoken and prone to spitting out lots of blood and fainting Hyatt. Excel and Hyatt live in an apartment building in the city, along with their pet dog Menchi, who they have deemed their emergency food supply. Excel and Hyatt are later joined by a snobbish but equally clueless rival officer of Across named Elgala.
Living in the neighboring apartment are three guys: Iwata, Sumiyoshi and Watanabe, who along with apartment neighbor and co-worker Matsuya, work for the Department of City Security. The Department's leader, Dr. Kabapu, also has a grandiose plan on stopping Across; he has the City Security workers dress in Super Sentai-like uniforms and sends them on different missions. Supporting Kabapu is an inventor Gojo Shiouji who likes little girls, and his gynoid Ropponmatsu, who later is deployed as two models.
The series follows the daily interactions among the two groups. Il Palazzo would send the girls on their missions but the results are usually a failure with some explosive or catastrophic damage to the city. Kabapu would send the City Security workers on some equally ridiculous assignment which would also go wrong. Eventually Il Palazzo and Kabapu become aware of each other's manipulations and escalate their plans. Excel finds herself being replaced by a impersonator who heads the ILL Corporation. Massive amounts of money is spent on elections and politics. Eventually the members of Across begin making appeals directly to the City's citizens before Il Palazzo publicly declares the existence of Across and its intentions to the public. Hyatt is captured and Excel and Elgala are later held in an immigrant detention center before being rescued by Il Palazzo, who begins the new phase of his plans.
The anime adaptation introduces some original characters: immigrant worker turned wandering spirit Pedro; alien mascot-like creatures called Puchuu; and The Great Will of the Macrocosm, the last of whom occasionally resets the storyline. The anime director Shinichi Watanabe cameos as an afro-wearing guy named Nabeshin, and a caricature of the manga artist also makes appearances.
Production [ edit ]
The series was created by Rikdo Koshi and based on a dojinshi he had previously created while in high school named Municipal Force Daitenzin (市立戦隊ダイテンジン, Shiritsu Sentai Daitenjin). Excel Saga was created as an evolution of Daitenzin in order to develop the character of Excel, as well as to laugh off the vision of a depressed and pessimistic view of the world.[3][4] Excel Saga is set in Fukuoka City and the names of characters and organisations are derived from local locations and buildings.[5]
Victor Entertainment contacted Shōnen Gahōsha about adapting Excel Saga into an anime, and the two companies approached Rikdo. Shinichi Watanabe was chosen as director. Watanabe added his own alter ego, Nabeshin, and expanded several elements. He says that the Great Will in the manga was "conveyed just as words", and he himself developed its appearance, eventually settling on the "swirling, talking cosmos". He also increased Pedro's role in the story from a single frame in the manga. Watanabe says he was pleased with that aspect of his work, noting that "Pedro's situation was considered unsuitable for broadcast in Japan".[6] The anime production staff was given the freedom to do anything they wanted as long as they kept the theme of the series intact, and Rikdo requested they created a separate timeline. Rikdo would later become influenced by the anime series due to its quick broadcast in comparison to the monthly schedule of the manga.[3] The anime makes frequent use of parody and in-jokes as comedic devices, with each episode having a genre-based theme. This extends to the animation, with several characters designed in the style of other works, such as those by Leiji Matsumoto.[7] Kotono Mitsuishi was chosen to play the role of Excel, and Watanabe was impressed with Mitsuishi's rapid delivery of her lines, saying that "she really pushed herself to the limit and beyond". He also says, "at times she was too fast, and there was plenty of time left to match to lip-synch". In such cases, either he would add new material or Mitsuishi would ad-lib.[6] At first Rikdo felt stunned and uncomfortable at hearing Excel speak, but he called the casting "amazing" and was pleased to hear his favourite voice actors read lines from his work.[3]
Media [ edit ]
Manga [ edit ]
The series began serialisation in Japan in 1996 in the monthly anthology Young King OURs and finished in August 2011.[8] The individual chapters began being collected and published in tankōbon format by Shōnen Gahōsha in April 1997 and volume 27 was released on October 29, 2011.[9][10]
Viz Media licensed Excel Saga for an English-language release in North America and the first volume was released on August 13, 2003.[11] Initially the series was published on an approximately bimonthly schedule, however the series had caught up with the Japanese release and the publishing schedule for volume 12 onwards was changed as a result.[12] Volume 27 was released on January 14, 2014.[13] The Viz edition includes a section called Oubliette, which consists of a sound effects guide and production and cultural notes.[5] The series is also licensed for regional language releases in France by Kabuto and in Italy by Dynit.[14][15]
Anime [ edit ]
Shinichi Watanabe dressed in the style of his 'Nabeshin' character.
An anime adaption was produced by J.C.Staff and directed by Shinichi Watanabe. Twenty five episodes were broadcast on TV Tokyo between October 7, 1999 and March 30, 2000.[16] At the publisher's request, the anime series follows a different storyline from the manga, however Rikdo was pleased with the adaptation.[17] Victor Entertainment produced the music of the series, which was composed and arranged by Toshio Masuda and directed by Keiichi Nozaki. Director Shinichi Watanabe wrote the lyrics for the opening and closing themes,. The opening theme which were performed by Yumiko Kobayashi and Mikako Takahashi who were credited as The Excel♥Girls . The lyrics for the opening theme Love (Loyalty) (｢愛(忠誠心)｣, Ai (Chūseishin)) were written "on the train, five minutes before the deadline".[6] The closing theme was Menchi's Bolero of Sorrow (｢メンチの哀愁のボレロ｣, Menchi no Aishū no Borero) The two themes were released together as a CD single on November 3, 1999.[18]
A twenty-sixth episode, Going Too Far, was deliberately created to be too violent and obscene for broadcast in Japan and was instead included as a DVD bonus. Watanabe commented that it "felt good to go past the limits of a TV series", although he thinks it "is not something that you should do too often".[17] In Japan the series was released on 12 DVDs between March 1, 2000 and January 24, 2001.[19][20]
The series was licensed for an English language release in North America and the United Kingdom by ADV Films and in Australia and New Zealand by Madman Entertainment. The English adaptation initially starred Jessica Calvello, with Larissa Wolcott taking over the role after episode thirteen after Calvello had damaged her voice during production.[21] In North America, ADV released the series on six DVDs between June 11, 2002 and April 8, 2003.[22][23] A complete collection of the series was released on July 6, 2004 as Excel Saga - The Imperfect collection and re-released in different packaging on August 1, 2006 as Excel Saga - Complete Collection.[24][25] In the UK, the series was first released between May 19, 2003 and March 15, 2004.[26][27] A complete box set was later released as Excel Saga - Complete Box Set on July 2, 2007.[28] The UK license for the series expired in January 2008.[29] The series was broadcast on UK TV channel Rapture TV from January 2, 2007.[30]
On October 30, 2010, Excel Saga was re-licensed in North America by Funimation Entertainment, who re-released the complete series to DVD on May 17, 2011.[31]
Soundtracks [ edit ]
Several albums were released featuring music from the anime. (Excel Saga - Original Soundtrack Experiment 1 (エクセル・サーガ ― 大いなるサウンドトラック実験1)) was released on January 1, 2000.[32] The album was later released in North America on August 9, 2005.[33] This was followed in Japan by (Excel Saga - Original Soundtrack Experiment 2 (エクセル・サーガ ― 大いなるサウンドトラック実験2 おまけ 寸止め海峡)) on March 23, 2000.[34] A North American release followed on November 1, 2005.[33]
Reception [ edit ]
Since its August 2003 release in North America, the manga has been among the 50 top-selling graphic novels on three occasions.[35][36][37]
The English-language reviews of the Excel Saga anime were broadly positive and enthusiastic. Mike Crandol of Anime News Network puts it in the same class as Airplane!, National Lampoon, Tex Avery, and Monty Python, adding that the "combination of character-based humor, outrageous slapstick farce, and a plot that is engaging if only for how weird it is make for a thoroughly enjoyable comedic experience".[7] A contrary opinion is expressed by Joel Pearce from DVD Verdict, who says the series is "occasionally clever and funny," but that "much of it is gratingly obnoxious".[38] Many reviewers express displeasure with middle and later episodes, saying they were "more of the same," that they had stale humor, that they were tiresome, or even painfully unfunny.[38][39][40] Episodes fourteen through sixteen, starring the Ropponmatsus, bear the brunt of this criticism, but several reviewers consider episode seventeen, Animation USA, to be one of the best.[38][40][41][42]
Reviewers also agree that the series suffers from too much filler in its later episodes, with Crandol describing the show as spinning its wheels.[43] Yegulalp reserves his harshest words for the unaired Going Too Far, calling it "pure, idiotic, wretched excess." He goes on to say that the episode has "the feeling of trying to deliberately enrage the audience by resorting to the only tactics left: genuinely offensive subject matter." Joel Cunningham at Digitally Obsessed disagrees, saying that the episode succeeds just in time, "with one of the series' funnier sight gags".[44]
The series generally receives high marks for technical aspects. Cunningham feels the animation is flat-out gorgeous, but Crandol considers it merely above average. In the latter's opinion, its quality wanes as the series progresses and increasingly relies on super-deforming the characters for comedic effect.[40][45] ADV's release earned praise for the quality of the video transfer and the DVD extras (particularly the Vid-Notes).[7][44] Reviewers especially appreciated the English voice acting: Crandol calls it brilliant, and several notes that Calvello and Wolcott were each able to capture Mitsuishi's Excel.[7][40][42] Pearce, in contrast, found the English cast to be pretty bad and its Excel to be "dental drill shrill".[38]
Akadot's reviewer of the manga writes that "some of the strange events go on a little too long and do not have the impact that they do animated," but that Rikdo's Excel Saga is "graced with fantastic visuals and a hilarious story," and that the English edition is "a masterpiece of the translator's skill."[46] Barb Lien-Cooper from Comic World News concurs that the manga cannot keep pace with the anime, but she finds Excel herself to be wittier in the manga and that the manga's plots make more sense than the anime's.[47] A reviewer of the French edition also praises Rikdo's work, noting that it is an "...easy read without problems of clarity".[48]
Share. Venturing into the spirit world. Venturing into the spirit world.
Note: Full spoilers follow for The Legend of Korra series finale.
Given the show's overall acclaim and passionate fanbase, The Legend of Korra finale was going to be a big deal no matter what. But it became something even more notable in the final scene, which found Korra and her friend Asami venturing off on a vacation to the spirit world together - and into a relationship with one another. Initially, whether what occurred was meant to be seen as romantic was questioned by some, but The Legend of Korra creators Bryan Konietzko and Michael Dante DiMartino went on record a few days later, confirming that yes, Korra and Asami are now a couple.
The Legend of Korra: Series Finale Review
This hasn't ended the discussion and debate over this ending, of course, and questions about the impact of this reveal, whether it was appropriate for a Nickelodeon animated series, and whether Korra and Asami had enough build up leading into their eventual coupling have continued. With that in mind, several IGN writers and editors, all big Korra fans, weighed in with their thoughts on the end of the series and the Korrasami of it all.
Eric Goldman, IGN TV Executive Editor
TV history, folks. We just witnessed it! I knew of and appreciated the “Korrasami” fandom and noticed that the show was leaning into more meaningful, “could it be?” moments between them in its final year. But it actually, overtly happening? There was no way. Because no show of this type had ever done it. And yet they did!
It's pretty amazing and I've been overjoyed not just by this bold, surprising move but seeing the reaction - including videos of fans watching the finale for the first time, in which they literally break down in tears of joy. This is oh-so meaningful and is such a huge deal. I can only imagine what it's like for gay and bisexual kids/teenagers watching Korra to have this kind of thing happen and to see themselves reflected in this way in a show of this sort when it just never had occurred up until now.
I strongly disagree with those who say the ending came out of nowhere and wasn't developed, because I kept seeing those moments between Korra and Asami, laying the groundwork for the relationship to begin (and keep in mind, it was just that - a beginning!). The fact that the show ended like it did actually make me respect those moments far more, knowing they weren't there just as a wink at the fans and were actual set-up that got a payoff.
Now was the overall approach to Korra and Asami subtle? Yes. Because it had to be. Nickelodeon was never going to let Korra, say, talk to Bolin about her burgeoning romantic feelings for Asami or tease a near kiss in an earlier episode. But the choices Bryan Konietzko and Michael Dante DiMartino made were done with determination. Obviously, every occurrence of someone blushing in real life doesn't mean “romantic feelings,” but the specific choice to take the time to write and animate such a thing on this show? Oh yes, that was an indicator that something was stirring between these two, among several examples.
I see some people say that if they had to be that subtle about it, they shouldn't have done it all, but that's basically asking for nothing to change. This is an incredibly notable step forward in this kind of representation on TV of this sort and the willingness Konietzko and DiMartino had to play within Nickelodeon's parameters (and Nick deserve credit for allowing this to happen at all) was key. Frankly, Nickelodeon would never have greenlit a show that was pitched to them as “the story of a teenage girl who's a bisexual and slowly begins to fall in love with a girl who's initially her rival.” They certainly weren't going to produce a show that made that overt from the start. Yes, I know Konietzko and DiMartino have said they themselves didn't know Korra was bisexual initially, but even if they did, it was never going to be presented as such. Unfortunately, we're just not there yet. But we weren't even at the place where we could imagine Korra was openly portrayed as a bisexual at all before this past week!
And please, in general, my fellow viewers, relax on being so mad abut TV creators “making it up as they go along”, like that's a bad thing. It's a TV show – that's how it works! Also, here specifically, Korra was 17 when the show began and 21 when it ended. She should change. She should evolve. She should make realizations about herself. That's growth.

And it's so awesome and impactful that it's her - the lead character, the hero. Korra was already a great character and now she's cemented her place in television history as a groundbreaking character. Have you ever seen an American, animated series, aimed at all audiences -- featuring a superhero-type character, no less -- who's openly portrayed as LGBT? Well, now you can name one. And that's a start.
One glance at the comments on our coverage of the finale -- and no doubt on this article -- exhibits that there are people who still don't want to see any overt (or for some, any at all) LGBT depictions in an animated, family-friendly show. Suffice to say, I'm coming at this from a very different viewpoint. Still, I find it frustrating when people say this ending “ruins” the show for them, whether they liked it or not – which goes hand in hand with my whole thought that our overall opinion of a show shouldn't rest solely on what happens in the last episode. Did you enjoy Korra's adventures through the years? I would hope you still can and do, and that wouldn't be undone because she and Asami fell for each other by the end. Plus, aren't you happy Korra is happy?
People are going to look back at this as a turning point, and I just can't get over my admiration for what Konietzko and DiMartino did here. The show is called The Legend of Korra and now she's an actual legendary part of TV. How cool is that?
Roth Cornet, IGN Entertainment Editor
Over the course of the next few years we'll likely talk about how The Legend of Korra in total, and Korrasami in particular impacted, altered, and, frankly, raised the bar for not just children's television, but entertainment as a whole. With limited time and space here - and given creators Michael DiMartino and Bryan Konietzko's recent statements regarding the relationship between Korra and Asami - I'll focus on just a few brief thoughts about those final glorious moments of the series. First, let me just acknowledge my heartfelt respect for DiMartino and Konietzko. I admire them not only for the bold and organic choice they made and for sticking to their guns, but for their immense talent, craftsmanship, and the powerful world and characters that they created. None of which should be overlooked. On to Korrasami.
Not only did that conclusion feel earned, it was stunningly rendered. Each time I see the beautiful image of Korra and Asami walking into the spirit world united, I am warmed anew. Not just because I found it to be a satisfying end as a viewer – which I without question did and do – but because it represents a door opening to a brighter world for all of us. Does that sound hyperbolic? Maybe. It's also true.
A few weeks ago I'd gone to see The Imitation Game, the shattering tale of British mathematician Alan Turing, played by Benedict Cumberbatch. I left the theatre - as most audience members likely did - heartsick at the thought that this man who had so much to offer the world, who had a limitless ability to stretch the bounds of what was possible, was undone by small minds and irrational fear of his sexual orientation. What was almost equally wrenching was the thought that if we look at things from a global perspective, relatively little has progressed since Turing died.
Exit Theatre Mode
Korra's finale was like a breath of invigorating air. It served as an uplifting and clear example of our ability to grow and change for the better. I've read much of the commentary on the decision to move forward with Korrasami over the past few days. While the lion's share have been celebratory, there are those who lambast the choice, and still others who feel that the creators didn't take the relationship far enough.
I read one particularly thoughtful piece on The Mary Sue that professed a deep hope that the progress made on this series not prove to be a novel, though significant moment, but rather “the bare minimum” of what we can expect from all genres of television. I couldn't agree more. However, as trite as it may sound, it's also true that a journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step. I'm thrilled that those behind Korra had the foresight and creative will to take it.
I don't know why it's taken us so long to get here. I wish it hadn't. I clearly don't speak for Mike and Bryan, but I'd imagine that they're just as bewildered as the rest of us in that regard. We're here now, though, and it's a pretty spectacular place to be.
I think of a child watching Korra and feeling valued, seen, and understood - just by virtue of that fact that they are reflected in something as lovely, smart, rich, and wonderful as this series. I think of a boy, girl, man, or woman who may in another time or place have been told implicitly, explicitly, or both that they are not okay, now seeing themselves in the role of the hero and, as such, getting one more sign that they are not only acceptable, but celebrated. That they have every opportunity to be extraordinary. That who they are is embraced. Every time that message is delivered to the heart of someone who needs to hear it, the world gets just a little bit better for all of us.
Korra has always been a show about bridging the gaps of understanding - be it between family members, friends, nations, or even enemies. This series has consistently challenged the viewer to look at life with an expansive and inclusive lens. I could write an entire essay on the lessons that each villain brought to our heroes and the complex and dynamic manner with which they were handled. Still another on how Avatar Korra was - to me – gorgeous in her imperfections, as it was in the cracks and edges of her humanity that she discovered her greatest spiritual strength. I'll save those reflections for another day, though. For now, I'll conclude by saying that – like any human being - Korra's own understanding of herself has shifted and evolved over the course of the four books. Her perception of what love is or could be had blossomed. Perhaps we should take our cue from her.

Graffiti has traditionally been put up quickly and under almost complete darkness to allow artists to avoid detection while painting places without permission, but one designer has thought of a simple way to give spray painters just a little bit of extra light to work by. Product designer Subinay Malhotra has created concept mockups of Lash, a light attachment for spray-paint cans that would allow artists to see what their can is pointed at and how their work is coming along. The product is essentially a small base that a spray-paint can would be set into, surrounding the can with a small strap that contains a pair of lights to illuminate what's in front of it.
Malhotra's idea is to make the attachment extremely portable too: because Lash is just a base, it would be easy to swap between cans; and Malhotra even envisions making Lash's battery able to recharge by motion, so shaking a can would be able to keep the light powered when its battery runs low. Of course, any light might be too much when spray-painting somewhere you shouldn't, but Lash is still an interesting idea for how spray painters could give themselves an easier work environment without totally giving themselves away.
TOKYO -- Credit card use in Japan is on the rise thanks to the growing popularity of internet retailers and a widening range of establishments that accept that payment option.
Payments made with credit cards rose 8.2% in 2016 from the previous year to 53.9 trillion yen ($494 billion), exceeding 50 trillion yen for the first time, according to the Japan Consumer Credit Association.
The largest factor behind the rise is the growing e-commerce market. Internet retailers like Amazon and Rakuten allow a variety of payment methods such as cash-on-delivery or payments at convenience stores, but a growing number of people are using credit cards for instant settlements. "We are seeing a nearly 20% year-on-year jump every month in use for e-commerce," said an official at Sumitomo Mitsui Card.
The e-commerce market reached 13.7 trillion yen in 2015, up 8% from the prior year, according to the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry. The market is expected to keep expanding despite concerns that labor shortages could lead to service declines.
The number of goods and services that can be paid for with a credit card is also climbing. Among the credit granted by Credit Saison in 2016, the amount that was used to pay for tax-related items like auto taxes and tax-deductible donations to rural municipalities under the hometown tax system, rose 40% from the previous year. Medical-related expenses paid for with a card also grew 25%. "The number of elderly who pay for medical expanses with a credit card at hospitals is increasing," according to credit card company JCB.
McDonald's Japan will ensure that all of its stores can accept all major international credit card brands beginning in the second half of 2017. Keihin Kyuko Bus introduced ticket machines that accept credit cards at Tokyo's Haneda Airport in March.
The latest statistics do not include Apple Pay, which was launched last October in Japan. Given that more payment methods are being introduced, "the market should keep expanding," predicts JCB.

Recall the classic cartoon scene of a character who simply continues over the edge of the precipice, ignoring the fact that there is no longer ground under their feet – they fall down only when they look and notice they're hanging over an abyss.
Is this not how ordinary people in Cyprus must feel these days? They are aware that their country will never be the same again, that there is a catastrophic fall in the standard of living ahead, but the full impact of this is not yet properly felt, so for a short period they can afford to go on with their normal lives like the cartoon character suspended in mid-air. And we should not condemn them: such a delayed response is also a survival strategy – the real impact will come silently, when the panic is over. This is why it is now, when the Cyprus crisis has begun to disappear from the media that one should think and write about it.
There is a well-known joke from the last decade of the Soviet Union about Rabinovitch, a Jewish man who wants to emigrate. The bureaucrat at the emigration office asks him why, and Rabinovitch answers: "There are two reasons. The first is that I'm afraid that in the Soviet Union, the communists will lose power, and the new power will put all the blame for communist crimes on us, Jews – there will again be anti-Jewish pogroms …" "But", interrupts the bureaucrat, "this is pure nonsense, nothing can change in the Soviet Union, the power of the communists will last forever!" "Well," responds Rabinovitch calmly, "that's my second reason."
It is easy to imagine a similar conversation between an EU financial administrator and a Cypriot Rabinovitch today. Rabinovitch complains: "There are two reasons why we are in a panic here. First, we are afraid that the EU will simply abandon Cyprus and let our economy collapse…" The EU administrator interrupts him: "But you can trust us, we will not abandon you, we will tightly control you and advise you what to do!" "Well," responds Rabinovitch calmly, "that's my second reason."
This is the deadlock at the core of Cyprus's predicament: it cannot survive in prosperity without Europe, but nor can it with Europe – both options are worse, as Stalin would have put it. What we can see emerging on the horizon are the contours of a divided Europe: its southern part will be increasingly reduced to a zone with a cheaper labour force, outside the safety network of the welfare state, a domain appropriate for outsourcing and tourism. In short, the gap between the developed world and those lagging behind will now exist within Europe itself.
This gap is reflected in the two main stories told about Cyprus, which resemble two earlier stories about Greece. There is what can be called the German story: free spending, debt and money laundering cannot go on indefinitely, etc. And this is the Cypriot story: the brutal EU measures amount to a German occupation that is depriving Cyprus of its sovereignty.
Both are wrong, and the demands they imply are nonsensical: Cyprus by definition cannot repay its debt, while Germany and the EU cannot simply go on throwing money to fill the Cypriot financial hole. Both stories obfuscate the key fact: that there is something wrong with the entire system in which uncontrollable banking speculations can cause a whole country to go bankrupt. The Cyprus crisis is not a storm in the teacup of a small marginal country, it is a symptom of what is wrong with the entire EU system.
This is why the solution is not just more regulation to prevent money laundering and so on, but a radical change in the entire banking system – to say the unsayable, some kind of socialisation of the banks. The lesson of the worldwide crashes after 2008 is clear: the whole network of financial funds and transactions, from individual deposits and retirement funds to the functioning of all kinds of derivatives, will have to be somehow put under social control, streamlined and regulated. This may sound utopian, but the true utopia is the notion that we can somehow survive with only cosmetic changes.
When it comes to listing people who are enemies of the future, Elon Musk would seem the last person to make the cut.
I mean, the guy helped create PayPal to start a revolution in digital payments. He's running Tesla, which is trying to start the electric car revolution. And he's running SpaceX, which is trying to revolutionize space exploration.
So it was a bit surprising to see the latest press release from the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, a “nonprofit, nonpartisan research and educational institute focusing on the intersection of technological innovation and public policy.”
The ITIF is running its annual Luddite Award, whose goal is to “highlight the year's most egregious efforts to foil technological innovation and progress.”
The first of 10 nominees, according to the press release:
“Alarmists, even including respected luminaries such as Elon Musk and Stephen Hawking, touting an artificial intelligence apocalypse.”
Such a designation seems even sillier in light of the recent announcement that Musk had joined other tech leaders in creating the OpenAI initiative to foster thoughtful development of AI.
In fact, the inclusion of Musk is more a reflection of the hard-line stance that tech orthodoxy has taken in the U.S. It Anyone who dares to even hint at the slightest restriction or regulation that limits tech companies doing whatever the hell they want is an enemy of the future.
Hawking gets name-checked a second time for also wanting a ban on “killer robots.” Other notable offenders: Vermont is terrible for limiting automatic license plate readers. Europe, China, and others had the gall to back taxi drivers over car-sharing passengers.
“Technological innovation is the wellspring of human progress, providing higher living standards, improved health, a cleaner environment, increased access to information, and many other benefits,” the ITIF writes. “Yet a wide array of interests today stubbornly oppose technological progress, just as the infamous Ned Ludd did in the early 19th century when he led a movement to destroy mechanized looms.”
With massive technological change sweeping over the planet, it would seem entirely reasonable for people to pause and ask whether the benefits outweigh the disruption. But in the U.S., with its tech-libertarian mindset, this is crazy talk. All change is good, the future will always be better than the past, and technology will only improve everything it touches.
When you've started lumping Musk in with Ned Ludd, all you've done is expose just how extreme that philosophy has become.
Lionsgate has moved back Taron Egerton's “Robin Hood” back six months for a Sept. 21, 2018, release.
Egerton is starring in the origin story along with Jamie Foxx as Little John and Eve Hewson as Maid Marian. “Fifty Shades of Grey” star Jamie Dornan will portray Will Scarlett, the half-brother of Robin Hood.
Otto Bathurst is directing from Joby Harold's script. Producers are Leonardo DiCaprio, Jennifer Davisson Killoran, Basil Iwanyk, Tory Tunnell, and Harold. Production companies are DiCaprio's Appian Way, Safehouse Pictures, and Iwanyk's Thunder Road Pictures.
The story will center on Robin Hood being a war-hardened crusader and joining with a Moorish commander in an audacious revolt against the corrupt English crown. The film will also be released in Imax.
A number of “Robin Hood” movies have been made in the past century. The most recent came in 2010 when Ridley Scott directed Russell Crowe and Cate Blanchett in Universal's “Robin Hood,” which topped $321 million worldwide.
“Robin Hood” would have opened against Universal's “Pacific Rim” sequel and Paramount's Johnny Knoxville comedy “Action Point” on its previous date of March 21. It's the second film to land on Sept. 21 and will open against Sony's “Goosebumps 2.”

Note: This is not a comprehensive list of releases and only games with specific dates are listed below. Some games are announced for August but have no firm release date.
August 2:
Tacoma (macOS, Windows PC and Xbox One) — "Like Gone Home, Tacoma is a story about people," Fullbright co-founder Steve Gaynor told Polygon last year. "It's about these six people who have been thrown into this situation and about how crisis can pull them together or push them apart. How many details you find out about who they are and what they went through is really up to you as the player."
August 8:
Ark: Survival Evolved (Linux, macOS, PlayStation 4, Windows PC and Xbox One) — Ark: Survival Evolved launched via Steam's Early Access in June 2015 and quickly became one of PC gaming's hottest titles. Now, as the team at Studio Wildcard prepares for a full commercial release, Ark's price has jumped to $59.99 from $29.99. Polygon reached out to the developers to ask why.
LawBreakers (PlayStation 4 and Windows PC) — Polygon went hands-on with LawBreakers in a preview event a year ago. Since then, Boss Key Productions has tuned the game with a private alpha release and two private betas. We participated in one of the betas back in March. LawBreakers is a class-based team shooter from the new studio started by Cliff Bleszinski, the creator of Gears of War. LawBreakers will cost $29.99 — "None of this $60 multiplayer-only bullshit," Bleszinski commented, though multiplayer on PlayStation 4 will require a PlayStation Plus subscription.
August 15:
Agents of Mayhem (PlayStation 4, Windows PC and Xbox One) — Agents of Mayhem is meant to be a clean break from the Saints Row series, but it also builds on Volition's expertise: an over-the-top, open-world third-person shooter characters who feel superhuman. Also, it's full of goofy jokes. Read our feature on the Agents of Mayhem and why it may be 2017's sleeper hit.
Nidhogg 2 (macOS, PlayStation 4 and Windows PC) —The original Nidhogg was fairly minimalistic, making two fencers try to reach opposite sides of the map. That's not the case with Nidhogg 2. The sequel has the same goals, and also features like stomping your opponent to death, kicking weapons from their hands and incredibly colorful, surreal backdrops. Here are 20 minutes of video, featuring creators Mark Essen and Kristy Norindr from Messhof.
Observer (Linux, macOS, PlayStation 4, Windows PC and Xbox One) — "What would you do if your fears got hacked and used against you?"
Rafal Basaj, with developer Bloober Team, describes Observer as something horrific that takes place in a Eastern European cyberpunk universe
"We are focusing on deep narrative and environmental storytelling," he said. "You play as a detective and observer and use your skills to scan the environment and hack player's fears."
Here is Observer's launch trailer and a bit of gameplay.
Sonic Mania (Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, Windows PC and Xbox One) — Sonic Mania, Sega's throwback to its mascot's 2D platforming roots, is exciting for longtime Sonic fans, mainly because of its developers' pedgree. Everyone involved in Sonic Mania has deep roots in the Sonic fan game community. That includes Christian "Taxman" Whitehead, known for his proprietary Retro Engine and phenomenal Sonic 1, 2 and CD remakes, and Simon "Stealth" Thomley, a frequent collaborator with Whitehead who is known for the fan game Sonic Megamix. Here's our developer interview from E3 2017.
August 22:
Uncharted: The Lost Legacy (PlayStation 4) — From Polygon's preview of the game:
If you were worried that Uncharted: The Lost Legacy would turn out to be an Uncharted knockoff, a lesser-than experience starring side characters that people don't really care about, well, I would be jumping the gun if I laid those fears to rest completely. I've only played the game for about 45 minutes. But it doesn't seem like that will be an issue. Instead, The Lost Legacy feels exactly like a proper Uncharted game — in ways both good and bad.
August 25:
Madden NFL 18 (PlayStation 4 and Xbox One) — The newest feature of the annual American football game is a story mode called "Longshot." The protagonist, Devin Wade, a former college star at Texas, has been out of football for several years. Wade will struggle to find a way back into pro football and fulfill his dreams. "Longshot" marks the first appearance for colleges in an EA Sports video game since the label canceled the NCAA Football series in 2013 and settled a lawsuit brought by former players.
August 29:
Absolver (PlayStation 4 and Windows PC) — Absolver is a hard game to wrap your head around, and thankfully this video goes a long way to explaining its allure. It's a hand-to-hand fighting game where players collect moves over time, and then string them together to create personalized fighting styles. The development team itself has a few members that are very deeply into mixed martial arts, and the animations show it. Absolver even takes player stances into account, and every move in the game considers which direction the player starts off facing in.
Mario + Rabbids: Kingdom Battle (Nintendo Switch) — It's like XCOM, but with French Minions, a Roomba and Mario. The game involves a party comprising characters from the Rabbids and Mario canon, adventuring through a Mario-style world. It's got two phases: exploration and turn-based RPG battles.
Mario + Rabbids Kingdom Battle is developed by Ubisoft with collaboration from Nintendo. Watch this eight-minute behind-the-scenes video with Shigeru Miyamoto to learn more about the unique crossover.
Yakuza Kiwami (PlayStation 4) — This is a full remake of the first Yakuza game that came out in 2006 on the PlayStation 2. The story revolves around Kazuma Kiryu, a rising member of the Yakuza crime organization who becomes a fall-man for the sudden murder of a crime boss. After 10 years in prison he's finally released only to find out the world has completely changed. Yakuza Kiwami (kiwami means "extreme") will feature an expanded story, a battle system similar to Yakuza 0 and have re-recorded audio. The game will retail for $29.99.
August 31:
Life Is Strange: Before the Storm (PlayStation 4, Windows PC and Xbox One) — The debut trailer for Life is Strange: Before the Storm was shown at Microsoft's E3 2017 conference. The game will focus on two characters from 2015's Life is Strange: Chloe Price and her best friend, Rachel Amber.
Before the Storm will have three chapters, unlike the five-episode Life is Strange, which was developed by Parisian studio Dontnod Entertainment. Before the Storm is being made by Deck Nine Games, the Denver-based developer founded in 1997 as Idol Minds.
Resident Evil: Revelations (PlayStation 4 and Xbox One) — Resident Evil: Revelations stars series veterans Jill Valentine and Chris Redfield. Set between the events of Resident Evil 4 and Resident Evil 5, Revelations sends players to an abandoned cruise ship, the Queen Zenobia, and the city of Terragrigia where they uncover the truth about the T-Abyss virus and attempt to stop a terrorist group from infecting the Earth's oceans.
For more on the game, check out Polygon's Resident Evil: Revelations review.
It might have been a lot of work, but it was a labor of love that inspired Seneca Valley senior volleyball player Kate Davis to make the most of her senior project.
Davis organized a charity volleyball game known as Volley for Education in which her Seneca Valley teammates, school administrators, the Potter Baseball Tour and many others from the community played to raise funds for the Seneca Valley special education program.
“I went around Cranberry and talked to local businesses to see if they would help sponsor the event,” Davis said.
“They were more than gracious enough.”
By the project's requirement, the event had to raise at least $1,000.
According to Meghan Lucas, former head coach for Butler's girls volleyball team and current coach with Renaissance Volleyball Club, the event raised more than the required minimum, although she didn't have precise figures.
Lucas served as Davis's mentor for the project.
“Kate came up with the proposal and had to put in at least 20 hours of work in addition to the event,” Lucas said. “It was neat that Kate was able to use this as our senior project. We were glad to help out and this is something she can pass down to her teammates.”
The event was held July 20 at Cranberry Park and began with lunch at noon, followed by a series of sand volleyball games that lasted until dusk.
“I think this is important because some athletes lack a sense of importance in giving back to the community,” Lucas said.
Joining the festivities was an organization known for giving back — the Potter Baseball Tour. Headed by coach Jeff Potter, the tour was established six years ago. Each year, Porter takes his team on a 26-day trip to 26 communities to play baseball games and support local charities.
“The last two years, we have done things with Seneca Valley, so we were excited about being back here,” Potter said.
“I met Meghan five years ago, and we raised funds for a man with cancer with a volleyball tournament. You would think the boys' favorite thing about the trip would be baseball, but it is this event.”
Potter said this is the first time his players have been away from home.
“I hope seeing this inspires them to do good things,” he said.
Davis was excited to have the Potter tour be part of her event.
“We held the event (on the precise day) so they could be here,” Davis said.
“It was awesome to see all the work that went in to this that led to everyone having so much fun.”
While Davis had fun putting the event together, she is thrilled to help the special education department at her school.
“My mom works in the special education department at Connoquenessing Valley Elementary School, so I know some of those kids,” Davis said. “We (the Seneca Valley girls varsity volleyball team) wanted to be a presence in the community.”

The owner of a popular Southeast Portland "goth bar" has sold the business to the manager amid anonymous allegations of sexual assault that surfaced on social media last week.
Jon Horrid opened Lovecraft Bar on Southeast Grand Street nearly seven years ago. On Monday, he stepped down and in a statement said he'd be leaving Portland as a Facebook post made the rounds alleging sexual misconduct and ties to white supremacists.
"I love my bar. I built it myself, from the ground up, with no savings. I'm not rich and I'm not a fighter but I am stubborn," Horrid wrote in a statement shared on Facebook by Lovecraft DJ and promoter Nikki Cavanaugh. "But I'm not stubborn enough to have foolish pride and jeopardize good people. So in order to protect my staff, I quit. And I am moving."
The allegations, first reported by Willamette Week, began circulating on Facebook earlier this month. Penned as an anonymous "statement written and backed by Survivors, Queers, Trans folks and/or Women and other non-men, People of Color, Workers, and those who live at the intersections of these identities," it was widely shared on the social network by self-identified Lovecraft patrons and performers.
The statement, alternately shared as a graphic and a text post, accuses Horrid of sexual assault and rape, claiming, "This has been known by many people for many, many years."
Horrid denied the allegations, saying he believed they were "lies" purported by "an angry mob of our fellow liberals."
Lovecraft staff also published a statement Monday condemning sexual assault and white supremacy.
"Rape, sexual assault, and disrespect for women in general is despicable. We as a staff never witnessed any of the acts the previous owner is being accused of," the statement read. "We do however realize that these allegations need to be thoroughly investigated. All of the bar employees here possess a commitment to social change."
Reactions to the news and Facebook statements ranged from support to condemnation.
"Wow this post is full of apologist language," one person wrote on the Lovecraft Bar page.
"Same bar, different day. Close. Now," wrote another.
"Since when do allegations and accusations = guilt? Allow the man due process," wrote another.

rebuildingsociety.com has been awarded full authorisation from the Financial Conduct Authority in recognition of our compliance with sector-specific regulations.
We are very excited to share news of this major achievement and important milestone with our community. Authorisation means that we meet the rigorous standards set by the FCA and that we can soon start to offer the Innovative Finance ISA.
Although we have been operating under FCA rules on Interim Permission since April 2014, being granted full authorisation helps us to continue building on the important relationships of trust we have with all our clients. We are proud to have achieved this milestone ahead of many other platforms, which we believe is testament to our small but dynamic team, systems, processes and controls.
It has been a long journey, consuming considerable energy and investment, since we applied for full authorisation in November 2014. We have continued to grow as a business and improve on our core processes throughout. The regulatory landscape is continuously changing, and we will make sure we stay abreast of developments that arise from our post-implementation review.
We are committed to delivering a top-quality service to all our customers, to assist investors by providing multiple investment options and to assist our borrowers in finding business finance that is more than just a financial transaction. We are now taking pre-registrations for the IF ISA and will confirm once we can on-board new accounts. Please look out for further updates; we know that many of you are keen to benefit from frequent, compounded returns.
“Thank you to everyone who has helped us in this journey. At a time when monetary policy discourages investing for the future, we're pleased to see more people taking control of their finances. A more congruent alignment of risk and reward is facilitated by transparent platforms like ours. For too long the traditional Financial Services industry has obscured who takes the risk and who takes the reward. So many new investors are surprised to learn about how much margin is taken between the demand and supply of capital, but after a few years of trialling our service, our most prolific investors continue to be our most supporting ambassadors.”
Daniel Rajkumar, Managing Director
Following our full authorisation, we hope to be able to offer the Innovative Finance ISA (IFISA) in the very near future.
If you are interested in the IFISA please register your interest now.

The President has been forced to defend himself as the media and some leftists in Puerto Rico like the San Juan mayor attempt to cast blame on FEMA and the President for allegedly not helping Puerto Rico. None of this is his responsibility.
There is no question the supplies are on the island but the conditions on the island are dismal. There are two significant factors our media won't report. In fact, they are lying about them — the roving gangs and the demands of at least one private union.
Problems on the island are devastating. The loss of power, shortage of diesel fuel, the collapsed infrastructure, and lack of cell phone service, are monumental, but, on top of that, union drivers are being told by leadership not to drive and there are roving gangs robbing the trucks.
Our media reports that the drivers aren't driving because they are helping their families. .
The infamous mayor of San Juan, Carmen Yulín Cruz, has let the desperately needed supplies sit in containers in the port while bashing Donald Trump.
The San Juan mayor is said to be Puerto Rico's Maxine Waters and has been lashing out at President Trump who is giving it back to her in spades.
Sam Juan Mayor Cruz praised convicted FALN terrorist. Like our New York City council president and Marxist, Melissa Mark-Viverito, she has praised Oscar Lopez-Rivera. That suggests she's hard-left.
She is currently being accused of not going to any meetings on the relief efforts. President Trump calls her ineffective and the media blasts him for it, but should he let her slide as she shifts blame from where it belongs?
Shipping terminals appear to be full of containers, but the truck drivers are not coming for the cargo. So what's going on?
Born and raised in Puerto Rico, Colonel Michael A. Valle, Commander of the 101st Air and Space Operations Group, and Director of the Joint Air Component Coordination Element, 1st Air Force, responsible for Hurricane Maria relief efforts, gave the following statement about the state of supplies on the island:
“The aid is getting to Puerto Rico. The problem is distribution. The federal government has sent us a lot of help… Moving those supplies — in particular, fuel — is the issue right now.
They have the generators, water, food, medicine, and fuel on the ground, yet the supplies are not moving across the island as quickly as they're needed.
It's a lack of drivers for the transport trucks, the 18 wheelers. Supplies we have. Trucks we have. There are ships full of supplies, backed up in the ports, waiting to have a vehicle to unload into. However, only 20% of the truck drivers show up to work. These are private citizens in Puerto Rico, paid by companies that are contracted by the government.”
Originally, only 10% of the union drivers were showing up to drive the supplies to their destinations. CNN and other news services are reporting that 20% are now coming in.
One problem appears to be the roving gangs.
San Juan blames Trump yet ports at capacity, 96% of aid held hostage by teamsters only 20% of drivers working & armed gangs hijack supplies. pic.twitter.com/F1x5pQJtuJ — Nια👌YouHaveToGoBack (@nia4_trump) September 30, 2017
[UPDATE] The Teamsters have said that they are driving and that rumor is not accurate. A private company hired transporting is responsible for some of the transportation problems. However, sources I have in Puerto Rico say it's not simply the private drivers, some teamsters are also slowing down the deliveries for various reasons.
This Driver Won't Drive
The President of one union is Frente Amplio de Camioneros, whose leader is Víctor Rodríguez. As a result of his rants on social media, he has been dubbed in Spanish, the “old man” and in English by the more derogatory, the “toothless” guy.
Two days ago Mr. Rodriguez was interviewed (see Facebook post below) and claimed FEMA won't release the supplies. The reporter didn't accept Mr. Rodriguez's version, but the San Juan mayor has been echoing the union leader's sentiment, claiming the US bureaucracy and regulations are causing the problems.
The union president not only won't let his drivers drive but he scoffed at the “gringitos” being able to come in and take over their jobs in their territory. This is during an abject emergency.
While there is no formal strike, Mr. Rodriguez appears to be exploiting the tragedy to gain ground in contract negotiations. A law passed in August by the governor has them particularly upset and the unionists say it accommodates Uber and Lyft to their union's detriment.
That legislative measure is known in Spanish as “el proyecto del Senado 525 que da paso a la Ley de Transformación Administrativa de la Comisión de Servicio Público” or simply “el Proyecto del Senado 525.”
In this next video, Rodriguez is angrily blaming the governor for the impasse. The reporter is trying to reason with him and drum in the point that this is an emergency.
The Puerto Rican people are generally not supporting the unionist and are humiliated by his behavior., calling him a “disgrace”.
Rodriguez is said to be demanding $50 an hour to deliver the supplies but we can't verify that except from posts on social media. The private union president is strongly dissuading scabs while not allowing his drivers to work for their agreed-upon salary.
President Trump is trying to get the word out
The President and his spokesperson are attempting to get the truth out despite an uncooperative, untruthful, left-wing media.
For those who don't let the truth get in the way of a good story here's the actual timeline of massive federal response in Puerto Rico-> pic.twitter.com/FnWgpnRy7A — Sarah Sanders (@PressSec) September 30, 2017
Another man explains the situation on October 1st.
Maria Sharapova cheated the gallows twice in the Australian Open second round on Wednesday, saving two match points with booming winners.
After serving a breadstick in the opening set, Sharapova struggled big time with World No. 150 Alexandra Panova and her cracking ground game. The “Siberian Siren's” forehand went off for most of the final two sets, but when push came to shove, the five-time major champion doubled down on her most precarious wing. With Panova serving for the match, the No. 2 seed kept her 2015 Melbourne campaign alive with a return winner and blistering forehand minutes later.
Put a player's back against the wall and you will soon see what he or she is made of. Thanks to the scoring system, a tennis match isn't truly over until the last point has been played, and it's often those crucial final points that end up producing some of the best shots and highest drama.
Without further ado – and in no particular order – check out ten of the best examples of the past few years:
Ready? Play (to save your necks)!
Jelena Jankovic vs. Tamira Paszek (1R, Australian Open 2008)
In what would become the most successful (and glittering) season of her career, the entertaining Serb began her 2008 Grand Slam campaign with a scare of the highest order. Then 17-year-old Tamira Paszek played lights-out tennis throughout a grueling final set, but thanks to her outstanding athletic and defensive abilities, Jankovic was just about able to keep herself in the tournament and eventually reached the semifinals.
Roger Federer vs. Rafael Nadal (F, Wimbledon 2008)
After twice knocking on the door of Federer's living room, Rafael Nadal managed to lift his first Wimbledon trophy at the third time of asking after one of the most tightly contested finals in Wimbledon – or maybe even Grand Slam – history. Nadal came extremely close to sealing the deal in the fourth set tie-breaker, but Federer produced a stunning backhand passing shot down the line to save match point and force a decider. The Swiss eventually lost 9-7 in the final set but with his back against the wall, he showed his class and clutch to come up with goods at the very business end of the penultimate set.
Rafael Nadal vs. Novak Djokovic (SF, Madrid 2009)
In a match that went down to the wire, this was the closest Novak Djokovic got to defeating Rafael Nadal on clay to that point in their rivalry. Ostensibly with the edge, the Serb held several match points in the final set tiebreak. The Spaniard, however, was able to outmaneuver his opponent on all three occasions. On match point No. 2, Nadal saved it with a rally as grueling as one could possibly imagine.
Dinara Safina vs. Alizé Cornet (4R, Australian Open 2009)
Much like Jankovic a year before, Dinara Safina had to fight off match points before making a deep run in Melbourne. A teenaged Alizé Cornet was up a double-break in the deciding set and had two match points on her own serve at 5-4. After a long rally, the Frenchwoman laid everything into a forehand down the line, but missed victory (and a Top 10 ranking) by millimeters. Safina continued to dig deep to survive and won the final five games in succession to march on into the quarterfinals. The Russian continued posting great results throughout much of 2009 but the loss seemed to send Cornet into a four year ennui. It wasn't until 2013 that the surged back into relevance.
Heather Watson vs. Peng Shuai (QF, Auckland 2011)
In 2011, Heather Watson earned the crazy scrambling crown when match point down. In their Auckland quarterfinal encounter, Peng Shuai threw everything she had at the Brit, but Watson ended up winning an absolute doozy of a rally to keep herself in the match. This year's Hobart champion went on to break back, but lost serve immediately afterwards and Peng eventually managed to serve out the match 7-5 in the second set. Watson's defense, however, when facing match point against her just a little earlier remains solid gold.
The same goes for the commentator providing analysis.
Fernando Verdasco vs. Janko Tipsarevic (2R, Austalian Open 2011)
Or, “the one where Fernando Verdasco (of all people) shows nerves of steel.”
Janko Tipsarevic was well on his way to upsetting the Spaniard but staring defeat in the eye the now 31-year-old kept his cool. The 2009 Australian Open semifinalist came up with a great backhand cross-court pass to save the first match point and an even more spectacular forehand down the line to save the second. Verdasco ended up breaking the Serb, forcing a fourth set tiebreak to send Tipsarevic into a complete meltdown, bageled in the tiebreak and final set.
Talk about a turnaround.
Francesca Schiavone vs. Svetlana Kuznetsova (4R, Australian Open 2011)
Two classics, one tournament.
It was the longest women's match in Melbourne history – and quite possibly one of the best. Svetlana Kuznetsova and Francesca Schiavone played their hearts out in this nearly five-hour epic (an often overused word but entirely appropriate in this case) – the final set alone lasted a full three hours.
The Russian had multiple chances to finish the encounter in the “middle” of the third, but her sixth and final match point was saved in spectacular fashion by the 2010 French Open champion. The Italian ended up taking the match, 16-14, an hour later. The match point Schiavone saved was symptomatic for the entire match; both women played high-quality tennis with tons of shot-making and creativity for almost the entire duration of the match.
Serena Williams vs. Vera Zvonareva (2R, Eastbourne 2011)
In what can only be called a “unicorn on leap day” scenario, both Williams sisters decided to play a grass warm-up event in Eastbourne to prepare for Wimbledon; both had been out of the game for an extended period of time due to injuries. With both entering unseeded, they were the most dangerous floaters in what had to be the most brutal Eastbourne draw on record. After defeating grass/Sydney specialist Tsvetana Pironkova, the younger Williams ran into top seed Vera Zvonareva, and though the American lost a hard-fought encounter, it didn't end without a backhand down the line which kissed the chalk and prolonging the thriller.
Serena's expression after seeing she just about got away with it: absolutely priceless.
Samantha Stosur vs. Maria Kirilenko (4R, US Open)
In the longest tiebreak in women's Grand Slam history, Stosur had multiple match points while Kirilenko had several opportunities to level the match to one set apiece. The Russian ended up prevailing in the tie-breaker 17-15, but not before having to challenge TWICE from match point down to save herself from losing the encounter. Stosur ended up winning the final set – and eventually the US Open – but neither the Australian nor Russian nor the crowd on Grandstand are ever going to forget this one.
(Seriously, just watch the whole damn thing. An absolutely awesome and entertaining half hour.)
Novak Djokovic vs. Roger Federer (SF, US Open 2011)
Or: “How can you play a point like that on match point?”
Djokovic was essentially staring down the tennis equivalent of a gun's barrel when he hit one of the most outrageous returns ever. In his post-match press conference, the Swiss struggled to accept the way his opponent got out of the tightest of spots and branded the shot as recklessness – almost luck – on Djokovic's behalf.
The Serb went for an all-or-nothing shot and proceeded to save another match point and win the next three games to book his place in the finals. The reaction to all this proved this to be a real parting of the ways, but Djokovic hit the perfect shot at the perfect time – whether it was lucky, reckless or not.

A former teacher at Noblesville High School is facing nearly a dozen felony charges after being accused of inappropriate conduct with two students.
Michael Douce, 31, turned himself around 4 p.m. Thursday at the Hamilton County Jail after being charged in Hamilton Superior Court. Douce is the assistant director of choirs, according to the school website.
He faces eight counts of child seduction, one count of burglary, one count of child exploitation and one count of dissemination of matter harmful to minors. He also faces two misdemeanor counts of contributing to the delinquency of a minor.
Douce is accused of having a sexual relationship with two Noblesville High School students between the ages of 16 and 18 throughout 2014.
School officials said they learned of Douce's arrest warrant being issued Thursday and he is no longer employed by the district.
Noblesville Schools released the following statement:
"Mr. Douce's employment with Noblesville Schools has officially been terminated for inappropriate conduct. We removed Mr. Douce from student contact as soon as we became aware of this situation in December, and have provided counseling services for all students in his class. Having first brought this matter to the attention of Noblesville Police, we worked aggressively during their investigation, and appreciate their dedication during this time.
"We are angry with Mr. Douce for violating our trust, and more importantly the trust of his students. We are saddened for the victims impacted by his actions, and our thoughts go out to them and their families."
A probable cause affidavit states that police were contacted by school officials on Dec. 17. Earlier that day, a parent told Principal Jeff Bryant about a naked photo of Douce on her daughter's cellphone.
Douce was the student's choir director.
When speaking to investigators, the student said that nothing physical had taken place between her and Douce and that nothing was forced. She added that she was in love with Douce and that she sent him nude photos, the court documents state.
A scan of the student's phone led to the discovery of at least five nude photos of Douce and multiple sexual text messages between him and the student, documents state.
The parent told police that she grew suspicious of the relationship between her daughter and Douce because the student would often speak negatively about Douce's wife, documents state. That is what prompted the parent to check her daughter's phone.

On Dec. 22, the student contacted police with the desire to clear up things about her relationship with Douce, documents state. She told police that the two began flirting during winter break, and when they returned to school in January 2014, a sexual relationship began.
The student went on to say that she performed sexual acts with Douce in multiple locations in the high school from January until the end of the school year, court documents state. The locations included a sound booth on the top floor and a storage closet in Douce's office.
During the summer, Douce invited the student to his home, documents state. The student told police that when she would visit Douce he would give her alcohol and marijuana.
She added that she had sex with Douce for the first time in the summer, and 30 to 50 times total, documents state. The acts took place in both Douce's and the student's home.
The Department of Child Services contacted the Noblesville Police Department on Dec. 22. DCS reported that Douce was involved with another student, as well.
Police went to the second student's home, and the student's parents confirmed the allegations from the DCS report, documents state.
The second student, also in the choir, told police that she first got Douce's number and began texting him in fall 2013, documents state. She said the texting began getting sexual around spring break 2014.
The relationship progressed, and they first had sexual contact in the school in May 2014, documents state.
The second student's phone was examined on Jan. 5, documents state. The probe led to the discovery of sexual text messages, nude pictures of the student sent to Douce and texts discussing plans to have sex.

Ride-sharing app under consideration for partnership offering service between homes and public transport hubs in areas with limited infrastructure
Uber in talks with NSW government to fill Sydney's public transport gaps
Uber is in talks with the New South Wales government to subsidise trips for Sydneysiders between their homes and public transport hubs.
An Uber spokesman said the plans for a partnership to “fill the gaps” in areas with limited public transport were “probably the most positive signs we've seen across Australia”.
How Uber conquers a city in seven steps Read more
“We're keen to talk about these partnership opportunities in each state, to be frank, and they are the most progressed in NSW,” the spokesman said.
Uber's global head of transport policy and research, Andrew Salzberg, said the company provided governments with a more cost-effective alternative to delivering and maintaining public transport services or building station car parks.
“Because we're already on the ground there's not an enormous upfront cost to get it running,” Salzberg said in Sydney.
The Uber submission to the NSW commuter car parking inquiry said 60% of trips in Australia using the company's app began in “public transport deserts”.
The company also suggested the government consider integrating Uber services into Sydney's Opal card payment platform.
Salzberg said a Canadian town had begun a six-month pilot of subsidising Uber rides in May, rather than funding a public bus service.
“They partnered with us, to use the fact that we already had Uber in place, and provide discounted rides to citizens in the city, but a deeper discount to and from rail stations,” he said.

A NSW Transport spokeswoman said services such as Uber's had a “potentially significant role to play” in delivering public transport solutions.
She said the government wanted to make it easier for Sydneysiders to get to and from train stations in the suburbs, which would help make public transport more attractive.
Last week the government announced eight pilot trials of on-demand bus services throughout Sydney, which would be operated by private companies.
mnordhoff: mnordhoff: What if the monitoring code was aware of leap seconds? Something like: …
For NTP clients not handing out these servers in the last day before the leap is likely too late. Many ntpd's will have been running for weeks or months already.
SNTP clients don't care about the leap second, but it'd potentially protect them from talking to a confused server just after the leap second (until the monitoring system has kicked those out anyway).
Now, I'm not sure what the overlap between “didn't announce the leap second” and “were off by a second after the event” were (it's in the data though if anyone is up for trying to figure that out). I'm sure it's less than 100%.
The downside to implementing something like that is that the pool system now has to get all this correct, beyond just having the right time. It wouldn't be a lot of code to implement, but it doesn't “feel good”. It's something that's hard to test and has to work – or the whole system would go kaboom[1].
Since it won't help NTP clients (vs SNTP) it doesn't seem worth the complexity.
This leap second I was around, had time and good internet connection, but generally I optimize for “will work without me sitting paying attention”. The NTP Pool doesn't exactly have a NOC or 24/7 staff. Or staff.
I think there are other things that are more likely to be beneficial, in particular things that are actionable weeks or months in advance. For example we could track the refid/upstream of each server, learn which ones mess up the leap second and warn operators to not use those as upstream servers. Maybe.
[1] (Which I suppose is the story of leap seconds).
President Trump Donald John TrumpHouse committee believes it has evidence Trump requested putting ally in charge of Cohen probe: report Vietnamese airline takes steps to open flights to US on sidelines of Trump-Kim summit Manafort's attorneys say he should get less than 10 years in prison MORE on Saturday touted the release of Republicans' final tax bill, saying that it will be "one of the great Christmas gifts" for the middle class.
"It's going to be one of the great Christmas gifts to middle-income people," Trump told reporters outside the White House before departing for Camp David for the weekend.
"The Democrats have their sound bite, the standard sound bite before they even know what the bill is all about. They talk about 'for the wealthy,' " he continued.
"But this is going to be one of the greatest gifts for the middle-income people of this country that they've ever gotten for Christmas."
ADVERTISEMENT
Congressional Republicans unveiled the final version of their sweeping rewrite of the nation's tax code on Friday. GOP lawmakers are hoping to pass the legislation in the coming week and send it to Trump's desk to be signed into law before Christmas.
The bill offers a series of sweeping tax cuts for individuals and businesses, while doing away with or limiting certain tax breaks.
The measure differs in some ways from the bills passed in the House and Senate in recent weeks. For example, final legislation lowers the top individual tax bracket from 39.6 percent to 37 percent. It also sets the corporate tax rate at 21 percent, as opposed to the 20 percent laid out in the original bills.
Trump and congressional Republicans have touted the tax overhaul as a boon to the middle class. Opponents of the measure, however, say that it amounts to a massive windfall to corporations and the wealthiest Americans.
If Republicans in the House and Senate are able to pass the legislation and Trump signs it into law — as he is expected to do — it would mark the president's first major legislative victory of his tenure in the White House.

The deal includes a combination of cash royalties and other non-monetary consideration.
The television adventures of Ricky, Julian, Bubbles and the other cast of characters at the Sunnyvale Trailer Park first aired in 1999, and quickly developed a cult following. The show moved to Netflix in 2014.
OrganiGram will work with the Trailer Park Boys' production company to develop branding, packaging and a product portfolio targeted towards recreational marijuana consumers and distributed exclusively by OrganiGram. The deal also includes product placement as well as branding of related cannabis items.
“This relationship solidifies one of our strategic building blocks as we plan for the legalization of recreational use [of marijuana] in Canada,” said Ray Gracewood, chief commercial officer at OrganiGram.
“Brands will play a key role within the cannabis market space, and we're devoting the thought leadership and developing our strategy well in advance of these expected changes to ensure we're prepared,” he added.
Louis Thomas, President of Sonic Entertainment Group, represented the Trailer Park Boys production company in the deal. “We had been monitoring closely to best understand how we might be able to enter the cannabis space in Canada,” he said.
“After our initial meeting with the Maritime-based executive team at OrganiGram, we all felt strongly that they were the perfect partner and the timing was right to move forward.”

There were more than 2,000 shootings in Chicago last year, and the city is on pace for more this year. The violence worsens in the summer months: over the holiday weekend, dozens of people were shot and nine died in the gunfire. Beneath the sobering figures are personal stories, both of fear and resilience. NBC News' Tracy Jarrett spent time in Chicago to hear them.
Part 2 in a series.
CHICAGO — At A.A. Rayner & Sons funeral home in Chicago, Charles Childs is used to planning celebrations of long lives. His biggest concern traditionally has been timing the stop lights as he leads grieving families in a procession to the cemetery.
These days, though, he has to worry about arranging a police presence to control the large, often emotional crowds that show up for the funerals of young people whose lives have been cut short by gun violence.
Rayner & Sons is a predominantly black funeral home founded in 1947 on the city's South Side. It handled the funerals for Emmett Till, the 14-year-old slain in Mississippi in 1955 after reportedly flirting with a white woman, and Mayor Harold Washington, Chicago's first black mayor.
Childs is the president of the funeral home and has been in the business for 40 years. He used to see one or two violence-related funerals a year. Now, he says he directs one or two every month.
So he has to take into consideration all sorts of things that he otherwise wouldn't — avoiding certain gang colors, navigating a tricky route between the service and the cemetery and hiring cops to keep the peace.
At these funerals for interrupted lives, the mood is as much tense as somber. Eulogies must be delicately written for “kids who may have been doing things they shouldn't have been doing,” Childs said. The smallest thing can turn grief to violence.
“It could be something so minor, like somebody stepping on somebody's foot or not saying hello or being asked to take their hat off,” Childs said.
In 2012, two men were shot outside a funeral that Childs was directing for a reputed gang member. One was critically injured, the other killed on the church steps. The family of the deceased had not told Childs about the gang association, so he hadn't arranged for police.
“I was standing over him when his eyes rolled in the back of his head,” Childs recalled.
Behind the scenes, funeral directors in Chicago are dealing with demographic challenges — young mothers and grandparents, some of whom have wrenching questions about how and why death visited their young children. Others are all too aware.
To follow up my review of ‘The Court of Broken Knives,' I invited Anna Smith Spark to answer some questions about the book and herself. The story, and its style, was refreshingly different, and a welcome change from the norm. Whilst I admitted to struggling with the voice at first, once I started listening to it, I was fixated.
To me, having finished it, I can say with all certainty that I will remember ‘The Court of Broken Knives', for years to come, because it made me see, and think, a little bit differently. And I think that's one of the most powerful things about books – how they can influence you as a reader. Think about it: it's just you and essentially words on a page, but it's the voice of the writer in your mind that speaks volumes.
And that's why I wanted to speak to Anna, and share with you what she had to say.
Hi Anna! We've spoken before, (during a previous interview mini-series on 2017 debut authors) but for those that have yet to come across you, in 50 words or fewer, introduce yourself.
I'm a grimdark fantasy novelist. I have a background in classical history and English literature, and used to be a petty bureaucrat. And a fetish model. I have dyslexia, dyspraxia and Asperger's Syndrome. I wear extreme shoes.
My favourite authors are Mary Renault, R. Scott Bakker and M. John Harrison.
And, in the same spirit, introduce your debut, ‘The Court of Broken Knives', in 50 words or fewer.
The Court of Broken Knives: either a brutish violence fest written by someone with no ability to use punctuation, or a lyrical masterpiece of profound depth and complexity. Depending on who you ask.
High fantasy, stream of consciousness prose, poetic interludes, extreme violence, tit jokes.
Possibly not for everyone.
‘The Court of Broken Knives' – Why THIS story?
I honestly don't know. I started writing and this is what came rushing out. I read a lot of military history, I've always been fascinated by the reasons (excuses) why people go to war. And the great myths and hero tales, that have a complex relationship with the violence they describe. History's attempts to understand Alexander the Great, for example, or the Mongols. Why people do these things, what the allure of the hero is, that we call Alexander ‘the Great', that people would follow him so far, through so much.
The Court of Broken Knives is an attempt to explore the urge to violence inherent in our culture. To explore what violence between men means.
As a child, I remember telling myself stories based on the great myth cycles, the Eddas, the Tain, the Tale of Troy, Beowulf. The Court of Broken Knives is basically very pretentious fan fic, I suppose.
For me, ‘The Court of Broken Knives' is truly unique. I've read some reviews that call it ‘art' as much as it is a story. Your voice – your vision as an artist – is breath taking. In my review I admitted to having to restart the book to truly relish what was being said, and how. And as the story develops, the PoV shifts from third and first and back again.
My question to you – did you set out to tell the story in this way (as art)?
Uhhh….
I probably am quite a literary author, yeah. I grew up with poetry and literature (I have a PhD in English Literature, after all). But this is just how I write. I don't really think about what I'm writing as I write it. It surprises me, sometimes, where it's coming from, how I hear the voices coming out of me, I don't think about them as I write.
I think it's very important, for example, that a particular character speaks to the reader directly in the first person, comments on the action without any narrator mediation. But I didn't decide to do that, it happened as I was writing. The story demands things. In fact, when I find myself consciously trying to write ‘for effect', I almost inevitably delete it because it's crap.
But I do obsess over my prose after I've written a passage, I think about the rhythms and cadences and line structure all the time, in the shower, in bed at night, constantly. The plot is important, of course, I think about that a lot too, but the words, the emotional responses of the different characters, how I convey that, that's what matters to me when I'm writing.
I did very consciously use the language of the old hero tales. The Court of Broken Knives is hugely influenced by Norse and dark age British mythology, and by Classical Greek literature. I suppose in some ways it's a mythical book as much as a fantasy novel. Or a historical novel in a world where the old gods are real, like the Iliad. I grew up walking the British countryside listening to my father talking about mythology, history, literature, folk-lore. Then I'd go home and read Tolkien, Norse mythology, the Mabinogion. I wanted to capture that sense of the numinous, of a world haunted by stories, of people within a landscape, trapped within the stories of their lives. As I said, myths and legends fan fic.
The other big influences on my literary style are probably James Ellroy and Edna O'Brian. The way Ellroy writes violence in White Jazz is astonishing. He's writing beyond language, just words as pure utter physical experience of pain. I binge read his books in my teens and they had a vast influence on me and the way I write. O'Brian's The Country Girls is pure pastoral, about young women in the 1960s rural Ireland. She links the landscape and the protagonist's emotions so powerfully, her descriptions of the land and the characters relationships with it, their existence within it, are haunting, very beautiful and complex. When she writes about a young girl gathering lilac blossom, the petals staining her dress with last night's rain, when she describes the old man with whom our heroine thinks she is in love as having ‘lips as cool as cocktail ice' … ah, it's so beautiful, such a powerful use of language.
There's a belief that authors put ‘a little bit of themselves' into their stories. Is this true in your case?
Gods, yes! I pour my heart and soul and life into my writing. All of the characters are me.
There's a wonderful line in Lovecraft's Dream Quest that sums up the creation of a story: For know you, that your gold and marble city of wonder is only the sum of what you have seen and loved in youth. It is the glory of Boston's hillside roofs and western windows aflame with sunset; of the flower-fragrant Common and the great dome on the hill and the tangle of gables and chimneys in the violet valley where the many-bridged Charles flows drowsily. These things you saw, Randolph Carter, when your nurse first wheeled you out in the springtime, and they will be the last things you will ever see with eyes of memory and of love.
Bringing this back to focusing on you- how did you get into writing? What made you want to write? And how long have you been writing for?
I have always written. Reading and writing are the centre of my life. My earliest memories are of reading and telling myself stories. My father and many of his friends write, I grew up with poets, academics, novelists, playwrights. It just seemed entirely instinctive to write.
I love words. I have Asperger's Syndrome, and I do sometimes wonder whether there is some relationship between that and my writing. I could probably be very happy as a brain in a jar communicating purely through written text. And the thought of going blind, of not being able to see written words, terrifies me.
I enjoy art and music, but I can't draw or play; what I enjoy most about both is talking and writing about them. Describing what a piece of art or music evokes. When I say ‘I love this song', what I actually mean is ‘I love the words'.
As I've said elsewhere, I stopped writing for a long time in my twenties. I was extremely unhappy at that time, really not at all well mentally or physically. I feel a lot better now I'm writing again.
What was the hardest thing about writing ‘The Court of Broken Knives'?
Keeping going. That famous fatuous adage about genius being 1% inspiration, 99% perspiration is true. It's fairly easy to start a novel / a band / painting the Sistine Chapel. It's carrying on doing it for long enough to finish it that's the hard part. You know how easy it is to lose interest in a tv series after a couple of series? To vaguely tell yourself ‘I'm a bit skint at the moment, I'll buy that must listen album next month'? That's the hardest thing, not doing that.
What did you learn from writing ‘The Court of Broken Knives'? Either about yourself, or about the publishing world?
About myself – that I swear even more than I thought I did.
About the publishing world – that everything everyone says about the publishing world is Gospel truth true.
If you could change anything, anything at all, now that the book has been released, would you?
No.
Well, maybe I'd edit like one word in a sentence, somewhere. Move some commas around. I spend weeks moving commas around. ‘Dark, and old, and weary'. No, it's ‘dark and old and weary.' No, it's ‘dark, old, weary'. Maybe ‘dark old weary'? Try ‘dark and old. Weary.'? Or ‘Dark. Old. Weary.'? STOP AND GO TO BED FOR THE LOVE OF GOD.
No.
So, before we finish up, I need to ask – how does it feel to be one of two leading ladies (one of two Anna's from Harper Voyager in fact) of grimdark in 2017? I for one am really looking forward to seeing more female authors on the grimdark scene.
Three! You forgot Deborah A Wolf, author of The Dragon's Legacy. (Harper, Anna, Harper! But yes, the more the merrier 😀 – Mike) We're the bloody triumvirate, the Three Goddesses of Grim. Here's us on our last ladies night out:
(Ah, yes, do I spot Anna Stephens, there, wielding a hammer? – Mike)
To be serious, I'm a bit ambiguous about it. On the one hand, it's wonderful that there are more female epic fantasy novelists getting big publicity.
The fact that two of us have the same name makes a bit of a point: there was another of those absurd ‘I've never read a book by a woman writer' things on Twitter the other day, and being able to shout ‘I've read more epic fantasy books by brunette British women called Anna than you've read books by all women ever in the history of the world? Seriously?' does kind of ram home the point. Also people seem incapable of not mentioning both of our books if one is mentioned, so it's free advertising….
But … both Peter V Brett and Peter Newman write epic fantasy with demons and are published by HarperVoyager UK. They're both white guys with short hair. No one makes a big thing about ‘the two Peters'. Anna Stephens and I are both fantasy novelists, so our books are similar in some respects, but very different in others. I dislike the idea that we're two ‘women novelists' like that's wildly different from all the male ‘proper novelists'. Two women both wrote books! Woah! Amazing! How crazy is that?
What is interesting is seeing more women writing about war, sexual violence, cynicism. I read a lot of historical fiction and the gender split between courtly intrigue (women) and war (men) is even more marked than in fantasy. Unpacking women's critical perspectives on male violence is particularly interesting. In Tehanu, for example, Ursula Le Guin goes behind the violence, looks at women's experience in a violent society. Mary Stewart did a similar thing in her Merlin trilogy, writing about the domestic backdrop to Arthur's wars against the Saxons. Elizabeth Moon writes about a female soldier, Paksennarion, but ultimately from quite a romantic, heroic perspective on noble or good war. Anna and I are both writing much more brutally – are our perspectives as feminist women different to male grimdark writers? I don't know. I'd be interested to hear what people think, if our gender does seem to have any bearing to the way we write.
Any advice to would-be writers out there?
Keeping going. That famous fatuous adage about genius being 1% inspiration, 99% perspiration is true.
I stopped watching TV to write Broken Knives. I haven't even taken the wrapping off the last two series of Game of Thrones. I haven't seen a single episode of Poldark, not even the one with the topless scything scene.
Write in the evenings. Write on the train going to work. Write in your lunchbreak. Write when you should strictly speaking be working, send yourself long emails or something. Write when you can, and keep going, and don't give up until you reach the end. It might well be crap. But at least you've finished it.
And finally, in 10 years' time what's the one thing that you want readers to remember from ‘The Court of Broken Knives'?
I'd hope readers might have thought a bit about the complexity of masculine violence and our cultural response to it.
Also, that Marith has better hair than Jorg Ancrath.
Last but certainly not least – THE LIGHTNING ROUND! No more than 3 word answers. Answer with the first thing that comes into your head – no cheating!
Which RPG character class would you be? Cleric. Ebook or physical pages? Physical pages. Which of your characters are you most like? Head – Orhan. Heart – Thalia. If you had to choose another author to re-write your book, who would you choose? Fuck off. Deity of choice? Dionysus or Nyarlathotep Perfect first date? The Egyptian rooms at the British Museum, followed by afternoon tea at the Ritz. Music to listen to whilst writing? Industrial folk. Who would play you in the movie of your life? Monica Bellucci. Which is mightier – the pen or the sword? Depends. If you weren't writing fantasy, what genre would you write? Historical fiction, natch.

Her debut The Court of Broken Knives is available now.
Jeremy Lin's back felt fine after he went through a full practice with his teammates Thursday, and he hopes to return to the court Friday night when the Nets play at Orlando.
Lin missed 17 straight games with a hamstring injury, returned to play 20 minutes against the Rockets on Monday night and then sat out Wednesday night's game at Barclays Center with back tightness. Though the team won't decide until game time whether Lin will be available in Orlando, he said the back issue isn't something to cause great concern.
“I think it's not anything seriously long term,” Lin said. “Wake up tomorrow, if I feel good, we'll go through the process. If not, it's day-to-day . . . It feels good today. We'll see how it responds tomorrow. No guarantees right now.”
The Nets (7-17) played some of their best basketball of the season in the 20 minutes in which Lin was on the floor Monday night. Though they lost to a tough Rockets team, 122-118, the Nets were plus-17 points on the scoreboard when he was in the game. When he was out? They were a minus-21.
Lin said that in some ways, playing basketball is like riding a bike because it didn't take him all that long to feel comfortable running the offense even though he hadn't played since Nov. 2. In other ways, however, there were some adjustments.
“Some of the stuff, in terms of my feel for the game, it didn't feel like I was gone for that long,” Lin said. “I felt the rhythm. Free throws or coming down and shooting certain shots or even just an open shoot-and-catch three, it feels so different in a game environment. You know, you have opponents running at you. So it was more of that stuff than the overall feel and control of the game. Running plays and going up and down in transition, that stuff is fine.”
The Nets were able to defeat a swooning Lakers team without Lin. Their overall record without him, however, is 5-13 and included a seven-game losing streak.

Though Lin would have rather been out on the floor, he said he discovered some things about himself and his teammates by sitting on the bench.
“Yeah, I've learned a lot,” he said. “Number one, be more thankful. I have a deeper appreciation for the fact I've been relatively healthy for a long time and I've barely missed any games, minus my second year.
“And then for specifically this team, I think I figured [some things] out. I haven't figured it out in terms of me being on the floor, but I feel like I'm seeing what the team needs and how I can run certain plays for certain players. I've been trying to come up with different ways to manipulate the defense.” Lin can't wait to put those plans into motion as the team embarks on a three-game road trip.
Said Lin: “Home, road, for me it doesn't matter as much. I just want to be out there.”
Florence Mall Santa disfigured in meth lab explosion
FLORENCE, KY – The man who filled the role of Santa Claus at the Florence Mall was injured this week inside Santa's Castle due to an explosion in the meth lab he was operating. Florence residents have known thirty-seven year old Jimmy Don Sherman as Santa for over ten years.
Mall officials say several of Santa's elves who are suspected meth users were also injured in the explosion. The food court was closed for hours while crews removed elf appendages from several stores after the explosion.
Police say the investigation uncovered a vast network of meth production and distribution including detailed understanding of how Santa's elves regularly stole ingredients for the meth lab from drugstores in the mall vicinity.
Devastated Florence Mall holiday shoppers say they recognized the familiar cooking odor of the meth lab within the mall but assumed it came from the numerous other meth labs in the community. “Meth labs around here is common. I drive by three just to get to my trailer.” said Independence resident, Rosalie Hughes
Reportedly Sherman has coped with a meth addition his entire adult life. Sherman's manager at the mall said the signs of Sherman's meth use were increasing every year. Losing most of his teeth in his mid-thirties gave him the appearance of a man several decades older. Also, police responded to several reports of Sherman allegedly stealing money from children's pockets while they sat on his lap.
Via his Twitter page (Twitter.com/KentuckySanta), Jimmy Don Sherman apologized to his friends and family saying, “It was wrong I disrespected Santa's Castle like that. These three weeks as Santa every year is my only job. I'm sorry for all them kids who had to find out Santa's a junkie.”
Reportedly Sherman also apologized to the employees who worked at the Rosetta Stone kiosk and were injured by shrapnel from the blast. Rosetta Stone employee David Holcomb said he was helping Sherman learn Mandarin Chinese during his breaks from work.
While crews work around the clock to rebuild the destroyed facility, mall security guards are taking shifts as Santa using the Victoria's Secret store as a temporary Santa's Castle.
During Jimmie Don Sherman's hospital stay, his children are under the care of his cousin Earlene Rae Sherman who is also the mother of several of them.
An NSA employee who is the co-chairman of a cryptography working group affiliated with the IETF will remain in that position despite calls from members to have him removed.
An NSA employee who is the co-chairman of a cryptography working group affiliated with the IETF will remain in that position despite calls from members to have him removed. The chairman of the Internet Research Task Force, the body that oversees the research group, rejected requests for the removal of Kevin Igoe of the NSA, saying that his position gave him little real power over the development of cryptographic standards and his removal would set a dangerous precedent.
The request for Igoe's removal came on Dec. 20, in the aftermath of a fresh set of revelations about the NSA's surveillance capabilities and efforts to undermine the development of cryptographic standards and algorithms. Throughout autumn, waves of stories about the agency's attempts–and perhaps successes–to compromise crypto standards had hit the news, including the allegation that the NSA had deliberately weakened a key NIST standard by inserting the compromised Dual_EC DRBG random number generator as the default choice. Security researchers and cryptographers assessing the damage of these revelations said that the implications may not be known for years to come.
In an email to the Crypto Forum Research Group, which advises the IETF on crypto issues, Trevor Perrin, a member of the group and security engineer, cited a number of reasons for asking for Igoe's removal as co-chair of the group, including his support for a widely criticized key-exchange system called Dragonfly, and the fact that he's an NSA employee. Perrin claimed that Igoe was the only one who voiced any support for Dragonfly and also made some technical suggestions that would have weakened the system.
“Kevin's NSA affiliation raises unpleasant but unavoidable questions regarding these actions. It's entirely possible these are just mistakes by a novice chair who lacks experience in a particular sort of protocol and is being pressured by IETF participants to endorse something. But it's hard to escape an impression of carelessness and unseriousness in Kevin's work. One wonders whether the NSA is happy to preside over this sort of sloppy crypto design,” Perrin wrote in his email, which also went to the chairman of the Internet Architecture Board.
“While that's of course speculation, it remains baffling that an experienced cryptographer would champion such a shoddy protocol.”
The CFRG has dual chairs in David McGrew, a Cisco employee, and Igoe, who took that position in 2011. The group is responsible for considering new cryptographic mechanisms and providing advice to groups within the IETF, the Internet standards body, on crypto issues and standards. The request by Perrin to remove Igoe generated a huge amount of discussion on the CFRG mailing list, and elicited strong opinions from a number of prominent security experts, including cryptographer William Whyte and John Viega, a software security expert.
“I think it's reasonable to hold the opinion that this discussion is silly and overhyped. I think there's a good chance that Mr. Igoe had no subversive intent whatsoever. I also don't see how an IRTF working group chair can, with high probability, subvert the process (though that doesn't mean it isn't possible),” Viega wrote.
“To me, the most important thing the group can do is address how it makes sure to protect from subversive actors. If we had a clear answer there, then I think it matters far less who the chair is, because we can give outside eyes a better comfort level. I don't think it's productive to be dismissive of the concern, even if you do not agree.”
On Jan. 5, Lars Eggert, chairman of the IRTF, formally rejected the request to remove Igoe, saying that his employment by the NSA should not disqualify him out of hand, and that his actions in the Dragonfly development process could have been seen as mistakes, but were not enough to support the idea that he was purposely subverting the process.
“However, while unfortunate, the mistakes made were not of a severity that would warrant an immediate dismissal of Kevin Igoe as co-chair. It is also the first such occurrence that I am aware of,” Eggert said in his email.
He also said that because of the way that IRTF groups are constructed, Igoe, as co-chair, doesn't really have any more influence over the CFRG group's work than any other participant. Eggert said, however, that the perception that the NSA could be exerting influence over crypto standard development could hamper the group's work and discourage people from contributing.
“However, would remove Kevin Igoe as a co-chair address this issue? Co-chairs do not wield more power over the content of the ongoing work than other research group participants. Should we then eliminate all individuals affiliated with the NSA from participating? We may be able to identify those that choose to participate openly under that affiliation, but what about consultants or academics that fund their participation partially or fully through NSA contracts, now or in the past? What about participants from or funded by intelligence agencies in other countries that may or may not have collaborated with the NSA?,” Eggert said.
Perrin, however, disputed this notion, saying that the idea of co-chairs only serving as glorified secretaries is a flawed one.
“Chairs are responsible for creating agendas, running meetings, deciding when and how to call for consensus, interpreting the consensus, and liaising with other parties. All this gives them a great deal of power in steering a group's work,” Perrin wrote in his response to Eggert's email.
Perrin also said that the questions surrounding Igoe's NSA employment and participation in the CFRG group are serious ones that could have long-term implications for the group and the IETF and IRTF in general.
“Finally, I think Kevin's NSA affiliation, and the recent revelations of NSA sabotage of a crypto standard, raises issues you did not consider. You did not consider the cloud of distrust which will hang over an NSA-chaired CFRG, and over the ideas it endorses. You also did not consider that as the premier Internet standards organization, the IETF/IRTF's actions here will make an unavoidable statement regarding the acceptability of such sabotage,” Perrin said.
“We have the opportunity to send a message that sabotaging crypto standards is unacceptable and destroys public trust in those organizations in a way that has real consequences. Or we send a message that it's no big deal.”
Despite Eggert's decision, there is still the possibility that the IAB, which is a committee of the IETF, could intervene, or that Igoe could choose to resign on his own.

Financial advisors (including yours truly) generally suggest maximizing contributions to your company's 401(k) plan. But what if your 401(k) plan is lousy? Here are some tips to help make the best of a lousy 401(k) plan.
Lousy defined
In what has become the most read post on this blog, 4 Signs of a Lousy 401(k) Plan, I discussed these four characteristics of lousy plans:
An investment menu consisting of proprietary mutual funds
Single fund family investment menus
Expensive share classes
A group annuity “wrapper” around the plan
So what can you do to make the best of a lousy 401(k) plan?
Invest in the best funds in the plan
Even if your plan is lousy often there are at least a couple of decent mutual funds in the plan. Consider focusing your contribution in these few investment choices and using investment dollars outside of the plan to complete your portfolio's overall asset allocation.
Get the full company match
If your company matches your contributions, contribute at least enough to receive the full company match. For example, if your plan offers to match half of all contributions up to 6 percent of your salary, that's an extra 3 percent contribution from the company, which gives you an instant 50 percent “return” on your money. That's hard to beat.
Contribute to an Individual Retirement Account (IRA)
Everyone can contribute $5,500 ($6,500 if you're age 50 or over) to an IRA for 2013 and for 2014. The deductibility of a traditional IRA contribution will depend upon your income and whether you are covered by an employer's retirement plan. Likewise, with a Roth IRA there are income ceilings that determine whether you can make a Roth contribution.
Take advantage of other retirement savings options
If your spouse's company offers a better 401(k) plan try to maximize your contributions to that plan. Do you run a business on the side? If the business is generating income, consider starting a retirement plan. Among the options to consider are a SIMPLE, a SEP-IRA, and a Solo 401(k). Remember that any contribution limits will apply to your company retirement plan and your self-employed retirement plan combined.
Discuss your concerns with your employer
Do your homework and outline your concerns with the plan. With new 401(k) disclosure rules that went into effect in 2012, your plan administrator may be more receptive to your input. Of course, common sense and civility should prevail when bringing concerns to the company's attention.
401(k) and similar defined contribution retirement plans represent an excellent retirement savings vehicle. The ability to contribute via ongoing salary deferral is a painless way to invest for retirement. Sadly some employer retirement plans are quite lousy. If yours is one of these plans make sure to look for additional ways to save and invest for your retirement and be diligent in making those contributions.
Please contact me at 847-506-9827 for a complimentary 30-minute consultation to discuss your 401(k) plan and all of your investing and financial planning questions. Check out our Financial Planning and Investment Advice for Individuals page to learn more about our services.

As heard on the radio
A new report puts Georgia in the middle of the road – no pun intended – when it comes to the state's overall bike friendliness.
In its annual survey, the League of American Bicyclists ranked the state 25th out of 50, with Georgia netting 38 out of a possible 100 points.
The ranking is a slight dip from Georgia's placement in the past but an improvement over the state's 2014 rank. It also maintains the state's gains since 2008, when Georgia ranked second to last for cyclists.
Brent Buice, who heads the state advocacy group Georgia Bikes!, helped compile Georgia's data for the national survey.
“I think the challenge – and why we've kind of plateaued – is because Georgia has not dedicated any specific funding to improve walking and bicycling opportunities at the state level,” Buice said.
Buice said funding for alternative transportation projects gets lumped into the Department of Transportation budget. He says for bike-specific projects, local communities usually have to bid for other funding.
Buice says the state could also use a vulnerable road user law, to bump up penalties for motorists who injure or kill those not in cars.
As far as improvements in the last year, the report noted the state's new safe passage law – which requires motorists to give cyclists three feet or more when passing – a “Share the Road” campaign and more dedicated federal funding.
On Monday, 14 men, including a physician, an owner of an online ticket sales company and a concierge for a film-production company, were arraigned on charges of patronizing a prostitute. Most were offered a chance to plead guilty to disorderly conduct, a violation; two accepted the plea offer.
Cyrus R. Vance Jr., the Manhattan district attorney, said his office had embraced the new approach, long advocated by those who see brutal oppression of women as the defining component of the commercial sex trade.
“They basically live as slaves of the pimps,” Mr. Vance said. “These are sad cases. These are women who need help.”
A federal law that went into effect in 2000 cracked down on sex trafficking. But in general, someone must be moved across state borders for the purpose of prostitution before federal prosecutors have jurisdiction.
The law that Albany passed in 2007 has no such limitation. It broadly defines sex trafficking by the methods a pimp uses to control a prostitute. The threshold can be met if the pimp instills fear of a beating, but also by more subtle intimidation, like spreading a secret that might subject the person to ridicule, or doing anything “calculated to harm” the health, safety or immigration status of the prostitute.
“One thing we've learned from women who have been prostituted is that it is very easy to get into, but very difficult to get out of,” said Norma Ramos, executive director of the Coalition Against Trafficking in Women.

Statewide, there have been 150 arrests on the new sex trafficking charge since the law took effect on Nov. 1, 2007, according to the State Division of Criminal Justice Services; all but 13 were in New York City. Seventy of the 150 cases remain open. Of the 80 that have been completed, there have been 13 convictions on the sex trafficking charge; other outcomes include 33 convictions on charges other than sex trafficking, and the dismissal of charges against 21 defendants.

The office of the Brooklyn district attorney, Charles J. Hynes, has brought 52 sex trafficking cases, the most of any district attorney in the state in that period. (One of those cases was recently thrown into uncertainty when questions were raised about the credibility of the accuser, a woman who said she had been raped and forced into prostitution at age 13.)
Mr. Hynes said the law and the changed approach were having important effects. “It has enabled us to rescue young women, girls really, from the grip of traffickers, who in the past have been able to avoid prosecution,” he said.

Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly has also begun to shift his department's enforcement efforts from prostitutes to their customers in a crackdown called Operation Losing Proposition.
The effects of the changes can be seen in arrest numbers in Manhattan. Arrests for prostitution fell by about a quarter from 2010 to 2011, while arrests of their customers jumped by about a third. And in the first three months of this year, there were 90 arrests in Manhattan on charges of patronizing a prostitute, nearly the total of 107 in all of 2011.
Bridgette Carr, director of the Human Trafficking Clinic at the University of Michigan Law School, said the trafficking law was part of a “paradigm shift” slowly taking hold across the country — one that will require a lot of training and planning by law enforcement agencies.
“We know what to do with criminals at 2 a.m. on a Friday night if we pick them up for selling sex. We have places to put them,” she said. “But what do you do at 2 a.m. if they are not a criminal? Where do you house them? How do you keep them safe? This is not easy stuff.”
The case brought last month by Mr. Vance's office is different from many others brought under the new law in that the women working as prostitutes were not children and did not identify themselves as victims of sex trafficking.
Mr. Vance's office determined, by listening to telephone conversations between the pimps and the prostitutes, that the women had been coerced into working for them.
According to Mr. Vance's office, the father and son team found customers through livery drivers acting as middlemen: Vincent George Sr., 55, had run a prostitution ring for at least two decades and brought his 33-year-old son, Vincent George Jr., into the business.

The Georges required the women to meet a quota each night or face harsh consequences, and took most of the money the women were paid — $200 to $500 for each customer, prosecutors said.
They brought women into Manhattan from Queens and Allentown, Pa., where the Georges had homes. A ledger recovered from the son's home showed that one woman had generated about $500,000 in 2011, prosecutors said.
The father and son pleaded not guilty and have been held without bail since they were arrested in Pennsylvania with a woman they were said to have recruited in Buffalo.

At the first sight, 66-year-old Mo Wenzhen, with its tanned face and grey hair, looks no different from any other farmer. But courage and determination rings out in his voice when he narrates how he led his fellow villagers out of poverty.
Mo, a resident of Shangxing village in Tianyang county, South China's Guangxi Zhuang autonomous region, had been a cadre in the village committee since early 1970s.
Thirty years ago, the villagers of Shangxing still lived deep in the rocky mountains, known as karst landscape, where hardly any land was fit for farming. Residents had less than 0.2 mu (134 square meters) per capita for farming, and the grain harvested was so meager that it only lasted for one or two months.
"For the rest of the year, we relied on the county government for money as well as food and clothes," said Mo, frowning as he recalled the bitter past.
The villagers lived in crude thatched houses, with no electricity or running water. When it rained, the road turned so muddy that people could hardly walk on it.
Determined to change his and the other villagers' fate, Mo, the then-deputy Party chief of the village, decided to lead them to move out of the mountains.
But his proposal was shot down as many senior people were reluctant to leave. Even the old village chief and his own father called the idea unrealistic, claiming nobody had ever done that before.
update: apparently this is now in the first page of google results for “binary reader”, so i feel obligated to point out that i posted an update on this, with better versions thanks to commenters both here and on reddit.
i post this in the tradition of pointlessly showing how concisely one's favorite language can perform a given task. also, i'm slightly proud of this version, as my previous wasn't nearly as to the point (and wasn't point free!). so, here it is:
readBin = (`div` 2) . foldl (\x y -> (x + y) * 2) 0 . map (\c -> case c of {‘0' -> 0; ‘1' -> 1; _ -> error “Input is not a binary string.”})
previous to this, i was using:
readBin xs = core (map bin xs) 0
where
core [x] n = n + x
core (x:xs) n = core xs ((x + n) * 2)
bin c = case c of {‘0' -> 0; ‘1' -> 1; _ -> error ” Input is not a binary string.”}
which, while absolutely equivalent, is overly verbose. now i'll explain the algorithm for those of you to whom it's not blindingly obvious (i'm not doing anything tricky or special here, i swear. i'm not that cool.). so, first off, we're mapping over this string (strings are lists of chars in haskell), and converting each ‘0' or ‘1' to the 0 or 1, respectively. also, if we come across something aside from a ‘0' or ‘1', we raise an error. once the string is converted to a list of ints, we consume the first value of the list, add it to an accumulator, and multiply that by two. why? because by definition any binary integer has the decimal value of the sum of all the digits, going from right to left, to the nth power, where n is the index starting from zero of the right to left position in the binary representation.
so, wait, if we're summing and raising to the nth power each digit from right to left, then why are we using a left fold (foldl)? because, in this case, adding the digit to the accumulator (x in the lambda passed to foldl) and then multiplying that times two is exactly equivalent to the previous definition i gave of the decimal value of a binary integer. i'll leave figuring out exactly why that's the case to the reader. also, in case you didn't notice, the fold i'm using in the first definition does one more multiplication by two than the other version, which is why, to reap the benefit of a more elegant, pointfree version, we must divide by two at the end.
the point, on the whole, of this? well, as i already said, it's pointless. but if there were to be one, it'd be this: damn, haskell is cool. i couldn't have ever done that in other languages i've used. (but i'm sure someone else could. i'm just not that cool.)
p.s.: if anyone finds any flaws with any of what i've said here, please take the time to comment — while this algorithm has passed a few test runs, and it seems right intuitively, i'm just not experienced enough to be sure it actually is.

VANCOUVER, BC – In their second match of the 2013 MLS regular season, Vancouver Whitecaps FC (1W-0L-0D) are set to face Columbus Crew (1W-0L-0D) in their only matchup this season, as the Eastern Conference side come to BC Place this coming Saturday, March 9 at BC Place.
TICKETS: http://ow.ly/ixgye Saturday's match between Whitecaps FC and Columbus Crew kicks off at 4:30 p.m. PT and is live on Sportsnet Pacific, Bell mobile devices and MLS LIVE (live.mlssoccer.com). 'Caps fans can also listen to Saturday afternoon's match live on TEAM 1410 radio and teamradio.ca, starting with the pre-game show at 2:30 p.m. PT. TEAM 1410 will also have a two-hour post-game show, which will begin following the match.
After defeating Canadian rivals Toronto FC 1-0 last weekend in their 38th home opener in club history, Whitecaps FC will look to continue their winning ways against Columbus. The ‘Caps now hold a 20W-13L-4D record in home openers and have not lost a home opener since 2001. This will be the Crew's first ever visit to BC Place.
WHITECAPS FC
The 'Caps began their 2013 campaign with a 1-0 victory over Toronto FC last Saturday in front of a sell-out crowd of 21,000 energetic fans at BC Place. Midfielder Gershon Koffie was named Budweiser Man of the Match for his solid performance, which included the match-winning goal, with assists coming from attacking midfielder Daigo Kobayashi and right back Young-Pyo Lee on a pretty passing play. Midfielder Nigel Reo-Coker also made his debut for the ‘Caps when he came on for fellow debutant and 2013 MLS SuperDraft pick Kekuta Manneh as a second-half substitution. The London, England native appeared calm and collected on the ball and was a key to the 'Caps energized attack in the second half.
The task at hand for Whitecaps FC this Saturday will be to continue their winning start to the 2013 season against a talented attacking squad in the form of Columbus Crew. The ‘Caps will aim to start Saturday's match where they left off in the second half last week, with cohesion and unity leading to offensive success and victory. Should they get the start together, Koffie and Reo-Coker look as if they will provide a solid foundation in the midfield as they hope to continue their successes from last match.
Head coach Martin Rennie and his squad will be without captain Jay DeMerit indefinitely as he had successful surgery for a torn left Achilles tendon this past Monday. The absence of DeMerit will likely see centre back Brad Rusin earn his first start for Whitecaps FC, as he performed strongly after replacing DeMerit in the 7th minute of Saturday's clean sheet.
COLUMBUS CREW A new look Columbus Crew are coming off of an impressive 3-0 win against Western Conference side Chivas USA. The first half featured many chances for both sides, but the goals did not come until the second half, when Federico Higuaín, Josh Williams and Dominic Oduro scored for the Crew.
The Black and Gold will be looking to maintain the same attacking tempo which they displayed against Chivas last weekend, looking every bit a formidable challenger in the Eastern Conference this season.
Midfielder and Designated Player Federico Higuaín, brother of Real Madrid star striker Gonzalo Higuaín, will look to continue his dominance in MLS play as he comes to play in Vancouver for the first time. Since joining Columbus late last year, the Argentine maestro has scored six goals and recorded seven assists in only 14 matches.
Complementing Higuaín is Oduro, who could prove a valuable addition for the Crew in the goalscoring department. The speedy Ghanaian striker was traded to the Crew after spending the 2011 and 2012 seasons with Chicago Fire.
If the 'Caps are to defeat the Crew, they will need to keep close tabs on Higuaín's long-range striking ability and Oduro's quickness on the counterattack.
HEAD-TO-HEAD
Saturday's match is the fifth all-time match between the two clubs, with Vancouver holding a 2W-2L-0D record against the Black and Gold - including one preseason match in 2011. In MLS play, the 'Caps and Crew have met three times, with Whitecaps FC having a 1W-2L-0D record.
In their last meeting, Whitecaps FC defeated Columbus Crew by a score of 1-0 . Young-Pyo Lee scored the only goal for the ‘Caps in the Blue and White's lone clash against the Crew in the 2012 MLS regular season.
In 2011, Whitecaps FC faced Columbus Crew three times, including one preseason match and two MLS regular season matches, and held a record of 1W-2D-0D against the Crew.
There is also some regional history between the two clubs, as Whitecaps FC hold a 7W-2L-2D record against Ohio state clubs. This includes being undefeated against Ohio-based teams while the ‘Caps were in the United Soccer Leagues First Division (USL-1).
Also of note, Whitecaps FC striker Tommy Heinemann will face his former team for the first time since leaving Columbus after last season and joining the ‘Caps in January.
NEXT UP
Following this weekend's clash against Columbus Crew, Whitecaps FC will head to Victoria next weekend to face University of Victoria Vikes in a friendly at UVic's Centennial Stadium on March 16. Kickoff is scheduled for 1 p.m. PT. The match will be streamed live at http://UVic.canadawest.tv

Ariana Grande is postponing several dates on her European tour following the bombing at her Manchester concert Monday.
"Due to the tragic events in Manchester, the Dangerous Woman tour with Ariana Grande has been suspended until we can further assess the situation and pay our respects to those lost," Grande's management told USA TODAY in a statement.
According to the statement, Grande's European tour dates through June 5 will be canceled, including dates in London, Belgium, Poland, Germany and Switzerland. The tour will resume in Paris on June 7. Refunds will be granted for the canceled shows, according to the Associated Press.
"We ask at this time that we all continue to support the city of Manchester and all those families affected by this cowardice and senseless act of violence," reads the statement. "Our way of life has once again been threatened but we will overcome this together. Thank you."
22 people were killed and scores more were wounded in the suicide bombing Monday at the 21,000-seat Manchester Arena where Grande was performing. The United Kingdom is on high alert following the attack, with British Prime Minister Theresa May raising the terror threat from "severe" to "critical," warning another attack could be "imminent."
"The spirit of Manchester - and the spirit of Britain - is far mightier than the sick plots of depraved terrorists," May said at a vigil in Manchester on Tuesday. "That is why the terrorists will never win, and we will prevail."
In response to the heightened security threads, Warner Bros. canceled this week's London debut of Wonder Woman, following Cannes Film Festival calling off a series of events. The bombing has also prompted venues and performers around the world to adjust their touring plans. Blondie announced they were postponing a series of planned concerts in Manchester, with Pittsburgh's Wild Things Park tripling security measures for an upcoming concert featuring Rick Ross and Lil Uzi Vert.
Grande apologized to victims in a statement following the bombing. "Broken," the pop star tweeted. "From the bottom of my heart, i am so so sorry. i don't have words."

In December 2012, French authorities asked the European Parliament to lift the immunity of far-right leader Marine Le Pen so that she could be prosecuted for inciting racial hatred.
In 2010, the president of the National Front party likened Muslim street prayers in France to the Nazi occupation, sparking widespread condemnation.
Many Muslim leaders have blamed Le Pen's fiery rhetoric on Islam and immigration for a rise in Islamic intolerance and xenophobia in France. But she insists she is neither a racist nor xenophobic, but simply a patriot.
"I want you to understand that there is no reason to ask the French to accept things that no other people in the world would accept. It's as simple as that .... I feel hatred towards nobody, but I have immense love for my people and for my country that I will defend in all circumstances," she said.
And it is a discourse that is increasingly appealing to many French, especially during these tough economic times.
High unemployment, factory closures and rising food prices have given unexpected credibility to Le Pen's anti-Europe, anti-immigration stance.
And her efforts to revamp the National Front's previously overtly racist and fascist image has also led to a surge in public support.
Le Pen won 18 per cent of the vote in the first round of France's presidential election in April, the party's highest-ever score.
In this episode Talk to Al Jazeera sat down with Le Pen in the European Parliament in Strasbourg for a wide ranging conversation that covers her thoughts on Islam and immigration in Europe.
Le Pen, who is serving a second term as a member of the European Parliament, also talks about the EU, Syria, as well as Libya where she says it was wrong to get rid of the Libyan leader, Muammar Gaddafi.
Talk to Al Jazeera can be seen each week at the following times GMT: Saturday: 0430; Sunday: 0830, 1930; and Monday: 1430.

Most sources of water will require some treatment to remove undesirable constituents or simply as a precautionary measure to deal with accidental contamination. Similarly, most wastewaters need considerable purification before they can be safely discharged into the surrounding environment. With waters and wastewaters there is likely to be more than one undesirable constituent, so it is often necessary to utilize different treatment processes in series to achieve the desired product quality. This means that most treatment plants are a system of unit processes or operations linked together in the most effective way to produce the desired quality changes. In order to select the most appropriate combination of processes, a designer must be aware of the characteristics of the impurities which are to be removed and the principles of the available treatment processes.
Although the characteristics of waters and wastewaters vary widely, it is possible to classify the main types of impurities found into five groups.
Floating or large suspended solids - leaves, twigs, fish, paper, rags, grit. Fine suspended and colloidal solids - clay, silt, microorganisms, proteins. Dissolved solids - alkalinity, hardness, salts, organics, metals. Dissolved gases - carbon dioxide, hydrogen sulphide. Immiscible substances - oils and greases.
In certain circumstances it is necessary to add materials as part of the treatment process; this could involve the use of coagulants in water treatment, the addition of chlorine for disinfection of water, or the aeration of sewage in biological oxidation. The divisions between different types of impurities are not, of course, sharply defined, and there may often be a degree of overlap in their properties. Nevertheless, the recognition of different types of impurities is useful as a means of characterizing the material which has to be handled and in giving some indication of the method of treatment which would be most appropriate. There are three main classes of treatment methods, each having several different forms:
Physical processes which depend upon purely physical properties of the impurity such as size and density. Typical processes are straining, sedimentation and filtration. Chemical processes which depend upon the chemical properties of the impurity or an added reagent such as solubility and degree of ionization. Typical processes are coagulation, precipitation and ion exchange. Biological processes which use biochemical reactions to remove impurities which are utilized as sources of food for microorganisms housed in a suitable reactor. These processes, which may be aerobic or anaerobic, are mainly used for dealing with organic impurities in wastewater treatment. Typical processes are activated sludge, biological filtration, oxidation ponds and anaerobic digestion.
In my subsequent posts, I will cover physical, chemical and biological treatment processes in brief.
In recent years the city's craft beer scene has blossomed in a beautiful way. Now, discerning lovers of barley, malt, and hops have the ability to sample new and different pints on a regular, or even nightly, basis. To celebrate local brewers' bountiful output, the NYC Brewers Guild has organized nine days of special events known as New York City Beer Week.
The festivities officially kicked off Friday with a tasting soiree at Grand Central's Vanderbilt Hall and continues through Sunday, March 2nd. All told, over a hundred Beer Week-sanctioned events including beer dinners, dance parties, and tap takeovers will take place citywide, and the Brewers Guild has furnished a handy calendar to expedite your planning.
While we recommend taking advantage of the week's offerings and sampling as many new pints as tolerance permits, the sheer volume and variety of beers on hand is daunting to say the least. With that in mind we've compiled a short list of notable beers that are sure to please amidst the swirling hoppy seas.
Sixpoint Hi-Res: If you crave hops, Sixpoint has them. Hi-Res takes the sharp, piney flavor profile of the brewery's now-classic Resin and takes it to the extreme, pushing the tangy bitterness to an absolutely absurd level. Still, its aroma packs enough tropical citrus to keep all areas of your palate tantalized. Like many uber-pale ales, there's a very high ABV to contend with, in this case 11.1%. Not that there's anything wrong with that. Find it at Pacific Standard's The Mostly Annual NYCBW Pacific Standard Hootenany on February 27th.
Eataly Birreria Flip Ale: Engineered through a partnership with Dogfish Head, the flip ale tastes as great on its own as it does in the classic warm, colonial cocktail of the same name. Caramel and biscuit malts give the beer a velvety texture that fits well with its sweet toffee and cardamom flavors. The Flip Ale has been available at Birreria's glass-topped dining room for most of the winter and Beer Week might be the last and best chance to sip the winter favorite.
KelSo Edible Ale: Made specifically for Edible Magazine, the limited-run brew is a triticale red IPA. Triticale, a heritage grain similar to rye, is paired with traditional hops to yield a flavor that's a bit more multivalent than the usual pale ale. Malty smoothness and a hint of spice round out each 6% ABV sip. We've also been told by KelSo brewmaster Kelly Taylor himself that the ale is made with 75% New York state ingredients. Meet the man and try his beer at Blue Ribbon's Beer Week on the Bayou tonight starting at 5 p.m.
Rockaway Brewing High Plains Drifter: Rockaway's delicious seasonal beers can be somewhat difficult to come by outside of the company's Long Island City brew house and growler system, but the Drifter is a kingly reward for those willing to scour the city thoroughly. The Scottish-style ale offers up luscious vanilla-spice sweetness thanks to a bourbon barrel aging process and is a great medium-bodied alternative for those weary of the heavy stouts and porters that dominate winter tap lists. Here's where to find it.
Other Half Imperial Stout: If there was ever a perfect winter beer&mdashldark, rich, and strong enough to erase all memory of snow-capped garbage mountains—Other Half has made it. Their imperial stout is densely nutty with hints of cardamom and cocoa. Freshly-poured pints have the color of black coffee and arrive topped with a head of smooth, rusty foam. The stout's powerful flavor comes with a wicked 11% ABV, making it the ideal final pint to nurse after a night of adventurous imbibing. Find it at their Bar Great Harry tap takeover.

General overview
Factorio is a game in which you build and maintain factories. You will be mining resources, researching technologies, building infrastructure, automating production and fighting enemies.
In the beginning you will find yourself chopping trees, mining ores and crafting mechanical arms and transport belts by hand, but in short time you can become an industrial powerhouse, with huge solar fields, oil refining and cracking, manufacture and deployment of construction and logistic robots, all for your resource needs. However this heavy exploitation of the planet's resources does not sit nicely with the locals, so you will have to be prepared to defend yourself and your machine empire.
Join forces with other players in cooperative Multiplayer, create huge factories, collaborate and delegate tasks between you and your friends. Add mods to increase your enjoyment, from small tweak and helper mods to complete game overhauls, Factorio's ground-up Modding support has allowed content creators from around the world to design interesting and innovative features. While the core gameplay is in the form of the freeplay scenario, there are a range of interesting challenges in the form of the Scenario pack, available as free DLC. If you don't find any maps or scenarios you enjoy, you can create your own with the in-game Map Editor, place down entities, enemies, and terrain in any way you like, and even add your own custom script to make for interesting gameplay.
Factorio has been in development since 2012. It is our first and so far only game. We deeply care about its quality. That means: Gameplay is the king. No annoying bugs. Optimize for performance. Support and interact with the community. No DRM, pay once, get updates for free.

Ramjas college +
NEW DELHI: BJP leader Shazia Ilmi on Wednesday accused Jamia University of putting "pressure" on organisers of an event to drop her name from a panel of speakers for a seminar on, a charge denied by the varsity.According to Ilmi, she was invited by RSS supported Forum for Awareness of National Security (FANS) to speak at a seminar on "Triple Talaq" and the university had pressurised the organisers to change the subject to "Muslim's women's empowerment: Issues and challenges" and drop her name from the speaker's list.The forum, which has RSS ideologue Indresh Kumar as its patron, confirmed the sequence of events even as Jamia Millia Islamia authorities rubbished the allegations."The event was not organised by the university or any of its department. The auditorium was rented out to the organisers and in such events the varsity has nothing to do with either the subject or choice of the speakers. It was not our prerogative," a Jamia spokesperson said, denying allegations of pressurising the organisers.Programme convenor Shailesh Vats, however, said, "We had finalised the speakers and the subject but then we were advised by the university to make some changes saying the atmosphere in the universities is not conducive to have such a discussion."Alleging that students had also gathered at the programme venue to protest her presence, Ilmi said, "There was a lot of pressure on the organisers. First they changed the topic from triple talaq to women empowerment. Then they wanted me to be dropped from the speakers' list. In the first initiation my name was there but in the second card, my name was removed.""The organisers requested the authorities to allow them to invite me but they said no she will create a lot of problems. I also learnt that students were gathered outside the programme venue to stop me from speaking at the event," she added.The allegations by Ilmi and the RSS forum come at a point when the debate of freedom of expression is at its peak in the country.DU'shad last week witnessed widespread violence over cancellation of an invite to JNU students Umar Khalid and Shehla Rashid terming them "anti-nationals".
China's official state news agency is pushing back against President Trump after he targeted Beijing on Twitter for not doing more to rein in North Korea.
"Trump is quite a personality, and he likes to tweet,” Xinhua said in an editorial, The New York Times reported. “But emotional venting cannot become a guiding policy for solving the nuclear issue on the peninsula.”
The editorial said the U.S. should not keep "spurning responsibility" for the situation in North Korea. It also said the U.S. should not "stab China in the back."

The news agency warned that "taking out this outrage on China is clearly finding the wrong target."
“What the peninsula needs is immediately stamping out the fire, not adding kindling or, even worse, pouring oil on the flames,” Xinhua said.
The editorial comes after Trump took to Twitter over the weekend to express his disappointment with China over its handling of the North Korean threat.
"I am very disappointed in China. Our foolish past leaders have allowed them to make hundreds of billions of dollars a year in trade, yet ... they do NOTHING for us with North Korea, just talk," Trump tweeted.
"We will no longer allow this to continue. China could easily solve this problem!"
North Korea last Friday launched its second ballistic missile in less than a month, raising concerns about Pyongyang's abilities to strike the U.S. mainland.
On Monday, Trump expressed confidence the U.S. would handle the situation.
“We'll handle North Korea. We'll be able to handle North Korea. It will be handled. We handle everything,” Trump told reporters during a Cabinet meeting at the White House.
With all the problems in the world, there should be at least a few where you can get paid to find solutions. Lo and behold, there are some problems that you can totally get armloads of money for, sometimes for simply sitting in a chair and thinking about the answer. Problems like…
10. The Cray Mathematical Institute's Millennium Problems
In the year 2000, the Cray Mathematical Institute brought out a list of math's seven most infamous problems, with the person who solves each problem getting a million dollars. Since 2000, only one has been solved. Grigori Perelman, a Russian mathematician who lived in his mom's basement, solved Poincare's Conjecture, an unsolved problem since 1904. However, he spent so many years on the problem, he pretty much dropped out of society, refusing a Fields Medal (math's highest honor,) and never claimed his million bucks, citing his disillusionment with mathematics. So as long as you don't mind losing your mind while doing so, there are still six problems out there for you to solve.
One such problem is solving P= NP, a conundrum first proposed in 1971. To put it in simple terms, P is a group of problems that equal, say, the size of a circle. NP is the bastard cigar shaped oval that tries to get one of its ends to match perfectly over the said circle, with positive outcomes of those same problems, but that have to be verified in a math process called Polynomial Time, which is pretty much how they can stay the same through moving time.
Got all that? Basically it's solving the exact same problem twice, except the numbers keep changing. It is currently the largest open problem in theoretical computer science. There have been numerous people who have tried their hand at this, and all have failed. The closest we've come is a promising claim in 2010 that solved part of it, only to be shot to Hell by mathematicians looking it over.
9. Archon Genomics X Prize
Headache-inducing math problems too hard? The Archon Genomics X Prize requires a little less math. For a $10 million prize, all the winner has to do is create a device that can sequence 100 human genomes within 10 days, with an accuracy of only one error in 100,000 DNA parts. Oh, and the cost has to be under $10,000.
Unlike the math problems, however, this can potentially do a hell of a lot more for humanity than just match numbers together like they were set up on a blind date or something. If this ends up being feasible, genome sequencing can go mainstream, detect future health risks, help make tailor-made medications and can be accessible to everyone with even the most fraudulent health plan.
Also, $10 million dollars. That's cool too.
8. The Night Rover Challenge
As solar panels are generally only good for collection during the day, NASA has started up a contest with a $1.5 million prize to the person who can figure out a long-lasting method of energy storage, so that things such as rovers can have enough electricity to work during the dark. But not the dark we deal with every night; NASA wants to be able to use solar-powered vehicles on the Moon, a place fairly infamous for being dark all the bleeping time. If somebody can crack this riddle, a rover could explore the Moon, Mars, or even beyond at all hours of whatever kind day they observe over there.
Imagine crystal-clear photos of the Pluto skyline one day. Right now, this would likely be impossible, what with the Sun being billions and billions of miles away and all. But a Night Rover could absolutely pull it off and, if you like money, you could be the one to help make it happen.
7. Qualcomm Tricorder Prize
Named after a futuristic device on Star Trek, the Qualcomm Tricorder prize is trying to find someone who can make a device that can diagnose patients better than a panel of certified physicians. By doing this and outsmarting doctors, you can win $10 million, and be forever known as the person who actually made a Star Trek prop come to life. Now true, you'd also have an an entire community of unemployed doctors screaming for your head, but you probably won't hear them over the sound of your own filthy-rich-guy cackling.
6. The Methuzelah Mouse Project (Mprize)
By testing mice in laboratories, scientists have found unfortunate consequences, like how mice have an extremely short life span. As many of the tests have to do with human health, results are usually not complete and extremely skewed. Therefore, if you can breed, genetically alter, or otherwise upgrade a living mouse to live past 5 years, you win $4 million. This can help out scientists, by letting them study long-term health risks, and pretty much speeding up science.
Also, this research would go a long way toward studying how these same measures can extend human life as well. To that end, you can win another 4 mil if you can figure out a way to not just make the mouse live longer, but also find a way to keep it healthy during its new old age. Basically, this would be the beginning of scientist's efforts toward extending just how old humans can get. And maybe then, The Immortal Hulk Hogan would finally live up to his name.
5. Knuth Reward Checks
Donald Knuth has written several books about computers and computer science, and has created an ingenious way to sell them: offer a cash prize to anyone who finds a mistake. If you find one, you win a hexidecimal dollar. It's not that financially impressive ($2.56,) and the actual check is a worth way more than the monetary value on it. But these checks are pretty much a prize in and of itself; Knuth has started using checks from the Bank Of San Sarriff. Never heard of it? That's because it's entirely made up. It apparently has branches on the also-fictional planet Pincus, so if you ever find yourself in the Pincus area and need a cash withdrawal, you're in good hands.
So why go to the trouble of creating an entire world for your fake bank and meager checks? Turns out hackers used his check numbers to break into his account and steal his money. How did they get the numbers? Excited people who found an error and won a check pretty much photocopied the things and posted them to the Internet, proving once again that book sense and common sense are total strangers to one another.
4. Virgin Earth Challenge
British mogul/beard enthusiast Richard Branson also has a prize out, and it's a whopper. A total of $25 million dollars would go to the winner of the Virgin Earth Challenge which is seeking a way to scrub greenhouse gases out of the Earth's atmosphere, so as to avoid global warming. There are currently 200 billion metric tons of the crap up there, but luckily the rules state you only need to remove one billion tons to prove that it's possible. Good; removing a mere billion tons of gas from the sky actually sounds quite doable. A cakewalk really. But 200 billion? Now that'd just be silly.
3. The Paranormal Challenge
The James Randi Educational Foundation's $1 million prize, awarded to anyone who can show that paranormal activity is real, started off when he was hosting a radio show in Britain in 1968. After a caller said Randi should back up his skepticism, he offered $100 to the first person who could prove that ghosts or spirits are real. He has since upped it and upped it some more, with the prize standing at $1 million right now.
But it's not as simple as speaking with a spook via Ouija board, or guessing what card Randi randomly selected from a freshly-shuffled deck. You have to show gobs of proof, and pass rounds upon rounds of interviews and tests, under very strict settings, in order to satisfy the challenge. And even then, the rules state that Randi will not admit that supernaturalism is real, even if you pass; he'll simply admit that you managed to meet his challenge, give you your money, and go right back to being skeptical.
Not that we've ever seen such an incident. Since 1968, no one has passed, or even come close; more people have guessed the exact price of The Price is Right's Final Showcase. Noted spiritualists such as Sylvia Browne and Rosemary Altea have either provided convenient excuses not to do it, or have attempted it and failed miserably.
2. The NASA Nano-Satellite Challenge
With a prize of $2 million, the Nano-Satellite Challenge is searching for anyone who can launch a small satellite into orbit twice in one week. That's right: twice. Because any ol' moron can reach orbit once in a week. Hell, we did that yesterday.
There's a reason for wanting two satellites in orbit, so it's not just busywork. NASA's purpose is to show how cheaply satellites can be made while still working, in the hopes of spawning more personal satellite usage. So if you've ever been thrilled that you could make a bottle rocket sail over a tree, prepare to be severely humbled, as someone who meets this challenge would see your tree and raise you freakin' outer space.
1. Elevator 2010
OK, so the prize money here is not the biggest around (only $4 million, versus Richard Branson's $25 million booty,) but if this challenge were ever met, everything about everything we do would change forever. The Elevator 2010 Prize would go to the person who designs a feasible space elevator. That's not a metaphorical title; it would literally be a 60-mile-plus elevator that would take you into outer space, perfect for mothers of astronauts who forgot their lunch at home before going to work on the International Space Station.
The prize is also divided into other parts as well, so if you figured out a cost-effective way to just make the elevator so it would not break (kind of big deal when you're dealing with little-to-no oxygen on the outside,) you get a million dollars just for that. So if you're more an “idea guy” than a “build things” guy, there you go.
Or, if you're a “close enough” kind of guy, this contest has you covered as well. A Seattle team won $900,000 several years ago for developing a cable-climber that successfully traversed a 3000-foot tether. Not quite outer space, but still pretty damn high up.

Illinois State Police are searching for a person who fled the scene of a crash on the southbound Tri-State Tollway near the Grand Avenue curve.
A man barricaded himself inside the home of an elderly woman in Franklin Park after fleeing the scene of a crash on the Tri-State Tollway, Illinois State Police said.The 28-year-old Chicago man, who is now in custody, escaped after his vehicle crashed into a median on southbound I-294 around 6:30 a.m. Friday. Police say he was in a domestic altercation with his wife during the accident. After the crash, police say he tackled an Illinois State trooper and fell to the ground before running across all lanes of traffic."As he approached the driver, the driver attacked our trooper and fled the scene of the crash," said Major Luis Gutierrez, regional commander, Illinois State Police.Officials say the man's wife and four children, who were in the vehicle at the time of the accident, were hospitalized as a precaution. The trooper was hospitalized with minor injuries.Police say the man, who was armed with a knife, then barricaded himself inside the home of a 91-year-old woman on Rhodes Avenue near Melrose Avenue."Nobody opened the door. He did it himself," said Mel Curita, the victim's son-in-law.Curita said two of his family members were able to get out but the woman could not. As SWAT teams surrounded the property, police say she was able to get to the phone and call them, providing a play-by-play of where in the house the man was.Although he never used the knife against the woman, crisis negotiators convinced him to come out after nearly two hours of negotiations around 10 a.m.The victim is under observation at a hospital.
A teenage son of a wealthy couple shot to death in their San Juan Capistrano home is accused of killing them while they slept last month.
Authorities said the attack on Feb. 9 paralyzed the teen's younger brother and included an attempt to kill one of his sisters.
The arrest of 19-year-old Ashton Colby Sachs on Friday ended a weeks-long investigation that had puzzled detectives, who say they still are trying to determine why the teen targeted his family.
“We're still working to find a motive,” said Justin Montano, the Orange County Sheriff's Department detective leading the case. “We're looking at all the angles right now.”
Sachs is charged with two counts of murder and two counts of attempted murder. Prosecutors did not say if they'll seek the death penalty.
Investigators found no signs of a break in at the home in the 32200 block of Peppertree Bend, a cul-de-sac lined with mansions in one of San Juan Capistrano's most exclusive areas.
Police believe Sachs traveled to Orange County from his home in Seattle, where he and his older brother, Myles, were involved in business ventures also linked to his parents, Bradford Hans Sachs, 57, and Andra Sachs, 54.
The suspect entered the home armed with a gun and shot his parents in their bedroom, then went to his 8-year-old brother's room and shot him, according to the District Attorney's Office. He then fired at his 17-year-old sister, missing, before fleeing the home and returning to Seattle, authorities allege.
One of the couple's two daughters – police haven't identified her – called deputies just before 2 a.m. to report the gunfire. Investigators interviewed Ashton Sachs and other members of the family soon after the shootings, but they “initially found little evidence leading to a suspect,” Sheriff Sandra Hutchens said.
A lead earlier this week led them back to Ashton, but investigators declined to reveal more. Detectives interviewed Ashton on Thursday in San Diego County, where he and his siblings planned to live, and then arrested him.
Law enforcement personnel also returned to the San Juan Capistrano house with a search warrant and seized several documents and computers.
“We feel confident he's our suspect,” Montano said. “Right now, we believe he's our only suspect
Ashton Sachs appears to have no criminal history beyond speeding tickets in Orange County and Washington state.
He is the second-oldest of the Sachs' five children, two of whom were adopted. He and his older brother, Myles, filed court papers two weeks after the shootings asking to be named guardians of their younger siblings, including the injured boy. The court records show that they also sought guardianship of the family's estate.
Ashton graduated from Dana Hills High School, then attended Saddleback College for two years where he was enrolled as a computer-science major. More recently, he was attending school in the Seattle area, where his brother Myles also goes to school. A traffic ticket he received in November lists an address in Gig Harbor, south of Seattle.
As a high-school student, Ashton stood out in computer-programming classes and had a talent for creating smart-phone apps, according to Paul McManus, his former teacher at South County's regional occupational program. “He's a great kid, exemplary,” McManus said Friday.
“He seemed like he really enjoyed his parents,” McManus said. “Dad sounded like a really interesting guy. He raved about him.”
A blogger who used the name Ashton51 wrote a 2013 tribute to Andra Sachs, praising her as an “entrepreneur and leader” with the experience to help other businesses. “You can make lots of money… but the most difficult task is to keep it,” the post cautioned.
The killing of the Sachs inside their 8,700-square-foot home – described by one real-estate broker as a fortress – initially left investigators with few clues. Officials with the Orange County Sheriff's Department said there was no sign of forced entry in the $3.7 million house on a quiet cul-de-sac.
Montano described the case as a “true who-dunnit, since the beginning.” He said detectives interviewed friends, family members, past business associates and “a long list of people… that may not have liked the family.”
The killings shocked San Juan Capistrano residents and dominated town gossip for days, but discussion tapered as the investigation proceeded with little news, said Joel Barrett, bartender at Swallow's Inn.
Still, the case remained on the minds of many. “The community cares. That's the bottom line,” said Kimberly Bennink.
Records show that Bradford and Andra Sachs helped launch a series of tech and green companies and owned properties in California, Florida, Nevada and Mexico. They also had a trail of court cases filed against them and their businesses.
The couple filed for divorce in 1999, a process that was so bitter that one judge said he wanted to make sure they stayed away from each other. They remained divorced – a financial decision, according to one friend – but soon resumed doing business and living together. The friend, Monte Burghardt, described them as soul mates.
On Friday, their son Ashton was being held without bail at the Orange County Jail. The District Attorney's Office said it had filed charges against him of murder and attempted murder with premeditation and deliberation..

TEAMS have retrieved one of the black box recorders of an Air France jet that crashed into the ocean in 2009.
It's hoped the discovery will help solve the mystery of why the state-of- the-art passenger plane went down in the Atlantic, while on a Rio-Paris flight.
"The investigation team located and identified the memory unit from the Flight Data Recorder (FDR) this morning," said France's Bureau of Investigation and Analysis (BEA), which has been charged with probing the disaster that killed 228 people.
In a statement, the agency added that the device was "in good physical condition" after it was "raised and lifted by the Remora 6000 ROV (robot submarine) on board the ship Ile de Sein."
Investigators announced Wednesday that search teams had retrieved part of a black box flight recorder from the Airbus A330, but not the part containing the key data.

Although numerous studies prove that Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) is effective in chronic pain treatment, psychologists acknowledge they need to learn which components of CBT provide the best outcomes for different people with pain, according to UK-based clinical psychologist Lance McCracken, Ph.D. speaking in a plenary session today at the American Pain Society Annual Scientific Conference.
CBT is the most frequently used psychological intervention for people with chronic pain, but McCracken believes psychologists can identify approaches to improve CBT outcomes. He said new directions for improving CBT for treatment of chronic pain may be found in the psychological flexibility model and Acceptance and Commitment therapy (ACT), in particular.
Psychological flexibility basically is the ability to be more aware, more focused on goals and more engaged. One aspect of psychological flexibility pertinent to chronic pain is called committed action, which involves goal-directed, flexible persistence. For pain management, ACT is an approach based on the psychological flexibility model and focuses on building effective patterns of behavior change rather than symptom reduction.
"Greater psychological flexibility is associated with less pain-related anxiety and avoidance, less depression, less physical and psycho-social disability and other measures of patient function," said McCracken, Professor of Behavioral Medicine, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King's College London. "Outcome studies suggest that ACT is effective for enhancing daily functioning and for decreasing psychological distress."
McCracken pointed to results of a 2015 study published by British and Swedish researchers that showed acceptance of pain, one component of psychological flexibility, may be a general mechanism by which CBT treatments achieve improvements in functioning, and more specific targeting of pain-related acceptance may lead to further improvement is CBT outcomes.
Another study, published in 2011, assessed the long-term efficacy of acceptance and commitment therapy in more than 100 people with chronic pain. The evidence showed at three-year follow-up 65 percent of study subjects had reliably improved in at least one key clinical domain, and improvements in acceptance of pain and another process called values-based action were associated with improvements in outcomes measures.
McCracken noted that research is underway to learn how to enhance these results precisely for those who do not show reliable improvements.
French Football Federation (FFF) president Noel Le Graet says a decision on Karim Benzema's future with France will be made by April 15.
Benzema, 28, was suspended indefinitely from the national team after being charged with conspiracy to blackmail as part of an alleged attempt to extort funds from his international teammate Mathieu Valbuena.
Earlier this month the investigating judge lifted a legal restriction that had prevented the Real Madrid striker from having any contact with Lyon winger Valbuena.
That led to speculation that Benzema would return to the France squad in time for Euro 2016 and on the same day the judge also granted the FFF access to all the files relating to the case.
As a result, Le Graet has now confirmed that French football's governing body will make a "definitive" decision about the player after France's friendlies with the Netherlands and Russia later this month.
"The federation is a civil party [in the case]," he said at a news conference on Tuesday. "We received the files last week. We're going to play the two matches with a lot of passion and then we'll discuss it with our legal advisors.
"We'll take a decision, in my opinion, before April 15 concerning Karim. Is he available for selection or not? We'll have a response by mid-April."
Benzema, who has recently returned from injury at Real Madrid, is accused of accepting a request from a childhood friend to act as an intermediary between the blackmailers and Valbuena. He has denied wrongdoing.
French prime minister Manuel Valls and sports minister Patrick Kanner suggested this month that Benzema should not be recalled by France, while Patrice Evra admitted this week that the controversy had harmed Les Bleus.

SpaceX's billionaire founder, Elon Musk, says this is the year that he'll unveil his plan for getting human colonists to Mars, as well as his 21st-century design for spacesuits.
Those are just a couple of the tidbits from a Reddit "Ask Me Anything" chat session he conducted on the eve of an ambitious SpaceX Falcon 9 launch — an effort that will involve trying to land the rocket's first stage on a floating ocean platform.
The 43-year-old Musk is the CEO and chief designer for the SpaceX rocket company as well as the CEO of Tesla Motors, an electric carmaker; and chairman of SolarCity, a solar power venture. In his spare time he's come up with a concept for rapid transit known as the Hyperloop, and has voiced concern about the rise of artificial intelligence.
Musk is revered as a rock star among the technorati, who share a large swath of a Venn diagram with Reddit users. More than 6,200 comments were registered during Monday night's hour-plus session, and Musk could answer only 26 questions. Here's a sampling:
Why does Musk say there's just a 50-50 chance that Tuesday's landing maneuver will work? "I pretty much made that up. I have no idea :)"
"I pretty much made that up. I have no idea :)" How would the Falcon 9 be secured onto the deck of its autonomous spaceport drone ship? "Mostly gravity. The center of gravity is pretty low for the booster, as all the engines and residual propellant is at the bottom. We are going to weld steel shoes over the landing feet as a precautionary measure."
"Mostly gravity. The center of gravity is pretty low for the booster, as all the engines and residual propellant is at the bottom. We are going to weld steel shoes over the landing feet as a precautionary measure." What's the status of Musk's plan to send colonists to Mars? "The Mars transport system will be a completely new architecture. Am I hoping to present that towards the end of this year. Good thing we didn't do it sooner, as we have learned a huge amount from Falcon and Dragon."
"The Mars transport system will be a completely new architecture. Am I hoping to present that towards the end of this year. Good thing we didn't do it sooner, as we have learned a huge amount from Falcon and Dragon." What about Musk's plans for a SpaceX spacesuit? "Our spacesuit design is finally coming together and will also be unveiled later this year. We are putting a lot of effort into design aesthetics, not just utility. It needs to both look like a 21st-century spacesuit and work well. Really difficult to achieve both."

It needs to both look like a 21st-century spacesuit and work well. Really difficult to achieve both." How much should we worry about an A.I. apocalypse? "The timeframe is not immediate, but we should be concerned. There needs to be a lot more work on A.I. safety. And, with all due respect to the Roomba dude, that is not a concern. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Of2HU3LGdbo "

And, with all due respect to the Roomba dude, that is not a concern. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Of2HU3LGdbo " How does Musk learn technical subjects so quickly? "I do kinda feel like my head is full! My context switching penalty is high and my process isolation is not what it used to be. Frankly, though, I think most people can learn a lot more than they think they can. They sell themselves short without trying. One bit of advice: it is important to view knowledge as sort of semantic tree — make sure you understand the fundamental principles, i.e., the trunk and big branches, before you get into the leaves/details or there is nothing for them to hang on to."

What daily habit does Musk believe has the largest positive impact on his life? "Showering."
In other news, Musk says he sleeps an average of six hours a night. And he thinks that the Kerbal Space Program simulation software is "awesome" — in fact, he joked that SpaceX uses KSP for testing software. That's another feather in the cap for the developers of Kerbal Space Program, which was honored as NBC News' Geek Gift of the Year in 2013.
An earlier version of this story didn't make fully clear that the reference to KSP was lighthearted.
After Garima, India gets Noorie! Strife-torn Kashmir has achieved a rare foot in the scientific research as its scientists gave India the second cloned animal and the world its first cloned Pashmina goat - Noorie (The Light).
Scientists at faculty of veterinary sciences and animal husbandry of Sher-e-Kashmir University of Agriculture Sciences and Technology (SKUAST-Kashmir) successfully cloned the first Pashmina goat using the advanced reproductive techniques under the leadership of Riaz Ahmad Shah.
Forty-three-year-old Shah, associate professor of Centre of Animal Biotechnology at SKUAST, was also the key researcher in the team of scientists at National Dairy Research Institute, Karnal, Haryana in 2009 that gave India the first cloned buffalo calf ‘Garima'.
It took two years for Shah and his eight member highly- skilled scientists' team to produce Noorie which was born on March 9 using a foster mother. Success was achieved under the World Bank-funded National Agricultural Innovation Project of Indian Council of Agricultural Research and took two years for standardisation of the technique.
“This technology is limited to a few countries in the world. But our team worked day and night to achieve this feat,” said Shah. “The successful cloning technology will not only help the pashmina productivity in future but will also help in rescuing some of the wild life species such as Hangul (the state animal of J&K which has been classified as critically endangered animal.”
Pashmina goats are found in the cold desert of Ladakh. People in the region rear the goats for the wool which is used to make the exquisite Pashmina shawls and jamawars that has a very high demand in and outside Kashmir. Pashmina industry also provides livelihood to lakhs of Kashmiris who weave the hand-made plain as well as embroidered shawls.
Professor in-charge, Centre of Animal Biotechnology, Nazir Ahmad Ganai said the success of this (cloning) technology shall open new vistas in strategic and applied research.
“It will help in multiplication of elite animals of desired sex, stem cell technology for regenerative medicine, transgenic for production of biopharmaceuticals like Factor IX, alpha1 anti-trypsin etc of value in human medicine, cloned animals as disease models, and conservation of threatened wild and domestic animal species,” he said.
Vice-Chancellor, SKUAST-Kashmir Tej Partap hoped the technology will help in harnessing better income opportunities for the people of the Ladakh region.
North and south Sudan have agreed "in principle" to demilitarise the disputed central region of Abyei and to allow an Ethiopian peacekeeping team to come in, an official say.
Details of the agreement are yet to be worked out.
The agreement was reached after two days of talks between Omar al-Bashir and Salva Kiir, the respective leaders of Sudan's north and south, according to Barney Afako, a spokesman for the former South African president, Thabo Mbeki, who is helping lead the negotiations.
"The parties have agreed to the idea that the Abyei area should be demilitarised and they agreed in principal that the southern and the northern forces are to pull out of the area," Afako said on Monday.
The political status of Abyei and issues such as oil revenues are yet to be discussed, Afako said.
To assist with the demilitarisation, the Ethiopian government offered to send in troops to oversee security so that civilians who fled can return, he said.
Engaged in negotiations
Afako emphasised that the two parties are still engaged in negotiations and that many details remain to be agreed on.
Commenting on the development, Rabie Abdul Atti, a member of Sudan's ruling National Congress Party, told Al Jazeera: "The agreement will happen before July 9, in the condition that SPLM will not have any existence in Abyei, the new forces should be under the UN.
"This will pave the way for the presidency to perform its function in Abyei and for the referendum or any other political solutions with SPLM."
Earlier on Monday Hillary Clinton, the US secretary of state, said the US wants to see northern troops withdraw from Abyei and would welcome Ethiopian peacekeepers being sent in.
"We would welcome both parties agreeing to ask Ethiopia, which has volunteered to send peacekeepers and to do so as part of a United Nations mission that will be strengthened," she said in Tanzania.
"The United States has made our view very clearly known to both President Bashir and Vice-President Kiir and I am looking forward to hearing positive news out of their ongoing discussions."
Tensions between Khartoum and Southern Sudan flared after northern forces occupied the fertile Abyei region on May 21.
Khartoum has refused calls from the US, the UN and southern officials to withdraw.
South Sudan is due to secede on July 9, but the split with north Sudan has been complicated by unresolved questions such as how to share oil revenues and the exact position of the common border.
Fighting has also continued for nearly a week between the northern army and south-aligned armed groups in the northern oil state of Southern Kordofan, which borders the south.
Southerners voted to secede in a January referendum, the culmination of a 2005 peace deal that ended decades of north-south civil war.
In the nation's history, only two Native Americans have ever been confirmed by the Senate for a job on the federal bench. Two. And of those two only one was "openly" Native American at the time of his confirmation (that judge, Frank Howell Seay, found out about his Indian heritage long after he was on the bench). Those numbers are particularly appalling when you consider that (only) 170 or so black judges have been appointed over the same span.
Today, the Senate has before it the nomination of a man named Arvo Mikkanen, who is partially of Native American descent. Mikkanen went to Dartmouth College and Yale Law School, clerked for two federal judges, and has been a federal prosector for nearly two decades. He received a "unanimously qualified" rating from the American Bar Association. President Barack Obama nominated him to fill a seat on the federal trial bench in Oklahoma.
Yet there have been no speeches in the well of the Senate on behalf of Mikkanen. No senators have patted themselves on the back for breaking through another barrier of bias and bigotry. Instead, the Mikkanen nomination languishes in silence, six months after the President first put it into play. No hearing date has been set for his nomination even though other candidates nominated before him already have been approved out of Committee.
Oklahoma's Congressional delegation was quick to denounce Mikkanen's candidacy as "unacceptable" but to this day has never (publically, anyway) explained why. Meanwhile, the White House appears to have expended no political capital in pushing Mikkanen's nomination to the forefront of the battle between the branches over judicial nominees. Like so many of his predecessors, Mikkanen has been left twisting in the wind by the U.S. government.
The Senate unburdened itself Monday from one of its many shameful legacies. But it still bears the white man's burden, and the nation's past due responsibility, of bringing Native American lawyers to the federal bench. It is no justification -- merely a convenient excuse, maybe for both parties -- that the White House didn't properly consult with Oklahoma's delegation before placing Mikkanen's name in nomination.
Mikkanen has done enough in his professional life to merit a hearing and a vote on the merits of his candidacy. He went to Yale, just like Oetken. He clerked for a smart judge, just like Oetken. He's worked for the executive branch -- just like Oetken. At last count, there were 91 vacancies throughout the federal court system. Do you think maybe the Senate would owe the American people at least an explanation for sitting on the Mikkanen nomination?
Sen. Schumer proudly told the world Monday: "When Paul becomes Judge Oetken, he will be living proof to all those young lawyers that it really does get better." Very true. Also true is the sad fact that the Senate's shoddy treatment of Mikkanen reminds young Native American lawyers that, for them, it really doesn't "get better." Or at least it hasn't yet.

LONDON — Terrorist group al Shabab released a video Saturday calling for attacks on shopping malls in the U.S., Canada and the U.K. The video, released by the Somalia-based group's official media wing, calls for attacks in the style of al Shabab's 2013 siege on the Westgate Mall in Nairobi, Kenya, in which more than 60 people were killed.
Minnesota's Mall of America, which was referenced in the video, said it was aware of the threat. "We will continue to follow the situation, along with law enforcement, and will remain vigilant as we always do in similar situations," it said in a statement. The mall, which is America's largest, has implemented additional covert and visible security measures, the statement added.
The FBI and Department of Homeland Security said in a statement that both agencies have been working in recent months with "members of the private sector," including mall operators, to prevent and mitigate such attacks. "As a general matter, however, we are not aware of any specific, credible plot against the Mall of America or any other domestic commercial shopping center," DHS press secretary, Marsha Catron, added.
The Royal Canadian Mounted Police said they were aware that al Shabab threatened the West Edmonton Mall in Alberta in the video, but “there is no evidence of any specific or imminent threat to Canadians in this video.” Edmonton Police Service Deputy Chief Brian Simpson said during a news conference Sunday that Canadians should go about their “normal day-to-day business” to avoid giving the terrorists “more power than they deserve.” But he encouraged citizens to communicate with police if they see anything that seems “suspicious” or believe someone is showing signs of radicalization. The West Edmonton Mall said in a statement that they have also heightened security measures and “will remain vigilant.”
London's Metropolitan police said they were “assessing the content” of the video.
Al Shabab was named a terrorist organization by the U.S. Bureau of Counterterrorism in 2008, and the Somalia-based group pledged allegiance to al Qaeda in 2012. In September 2013, the group carried out a days-long attack on the luxury Westgate Mall, which left at least 67 people dead and about 200 injured.
Al Shabab said at the time that it sent militants with AK-47s and grenades into the Nairobi mall in “retribution” for Kenya's efforts to help the Somali government defeat the extremist group.
During a conference Thursday on countering violent extremism, President Barack Obama announced a new digital communications hub that would allow the U.S. work with the United Arab Emirates to combat “terrorist propaganda” spread by groups like ISIS, Boko Haram and al Shabab.

Satellite photos published Monday showed the aftermath of an alleged Israeli airstrike on a reported Iranian military base being constructed in Syria, some 50 kilometers (31 miles) from Israel's northern border, indicating several buildings had been destroyed.
The images, provided by the Israeli satellite company, ImageSat International, show the destruction of seven buildings on the base at al-Qiswah, some 13 kilometers (8 miles) south of the Syrian capital of Damascus. Another three buildings were damaged. Most of the structures appear to be barracks and garages.
The photographs were taken on Monday afternoon by Israel's EROS-B satellite, the company said.

Overnight Friday-Saturday, numerous Arabic media outlets reported that Israel fired multiple missiles at the base.
Syrian state media said the country's air defenses intercepted at least two Israeli missiles fired at a government “military position” in Damascus province, but that the attack still caused damage.
A Sky News Arabic report said that the missiles were fired from within Lebanese airspace.
Some Arab media reports said 12 Iranian military personnel were killed in the strike.
There was no official Israeli comment.
A Lebanese news network affiliated with the Hezbollah terror group claimed that in the attack, Israel fired two Jericho 1 surface-to-surface missiles at the base, and that one of the missiles was downed by the Russian Pantsir-S1 air defense system.
If true, this would be the first reported operational use of the Jericho 1 ballistic missile. It is, however, an odd claim, as Israel possesses several other missile systems that are more suited to the range required for such a strike, for instance, the LORA.
The construction of the alleged Iranian base was first reported by the BBC last month, citing a Western intelligence official.
“The images of the base do not reveal any signs of large or unconventional weaponry, which means if it was a base, it would most likely be to house soldiers and vehicles,” the BBC said, quoting a source who said it was possible that senior Iranian military officials may have visited the compound in recent months.
Images of the base broadcast by the BBC showed “a series of two dozen large low-rise buildings, likely for housing soldiers and vehicles.”
According to the Israeli military analysis blog Intelli Times, the transport jeeps and trucks with attached rocket launchers seen in the footage were consistent with the types used by Iran-backed Shiite militias.
A few days later, ImageSat International took photographs, also with the EROS-B satellite of the site, which further supported the BBC claim.
Those satellite pictures suggested that one of the buildings on the base is a mosque. If it is, according to ISI's intelligence unit, it likely pointed to the presence of Iranians or other foreign Muslims.
Yet ISI stressed that the assumption that the site was being used by Iranians was taken from foreign media reports, and that the images alone did not necessarily prove Iranian presence.
Israel has long warned that Iran is trying to establish a permanent presence in Syria as part of its efforts to control a land corridor from Iran through to the Mediterranean Sea as it attempts to expand its influence across the Middle East.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said often that Israel will not allow Iran to establish a permanent presence in Syria, and was reported late last month to have sent a warning to this effect via a third party to Syrian President Bashar Assad.
Israel, along with Sunni Muslim states in the region, has viewed with mounting concern Iranian expansionism in the Middle East, in Iraq, in Syria — with the backing of Russia — and through proxy groups, such as Hezbollah in Lebanon, Hamas in the Gaza Strip, and the Houthis in Yemen.
Last month, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said that a recently announced agreement on the terms of a ceasefire in Syria did not include a Russian commitment to ensure Iran-linked militias would be pulled out of the country.
He said that Iran maintained a “legitimate” presence in Syria, according to the Interfax news agency.
The statement came as officials from the US National Security Council flew into Israel for talks with security heads, primarily over the US-Russia agreement. They were expected to discuss Iran's alleged construction of the military base at al-Kiswah.
Last month, Netanyahu announced that Israel would not be bound by the deal, which would somewhat distance Iranian proxies from the border with Israel. The agreement affirms a call for “the reduction, and ultimate elimination” of foreign fighters from southern Syria.
According to reports, the deal applies to Iranian proxies fighting on behalf of Assad's regime, which would be required to leave the border area and eventually Syria.
But according to an unnamed Israeli official, under the deal, militias associated with Iran would be allowed to maintain positions as close as five to seven kilometers (3.1-4.3 miles) to the border in some areas, Reuters reported.
Times of Israel staff contributed to this report.
Two wins over Manchester City and Genoa in the space of five days got the Bianconeri's season up on its feet and the champions reconvened in Vinovo this morning to begin preparing for another important week, with games at home to Frosinone on Wednesday and away at Napoli the following Saturday on the horizon.
With his eyes on six points from those coming fixtures, Massimiliano Allegri set his men back to work at Juventus Center today with a post-match workout as those involved against the Rossoblu underwent a routine warm-down session.
Missing out on training today were stricken duo Mario Mandzukic and Alvaro Morata, who were both subjected to medical examinations after reporting injuries during the win over Genoa.
The Croatian forward's tests revealed a first-grade tear of the bicep femoris muscle in his right thigh, which will require a recovery period of 20 days.
Morata's medical checks ruled out any serious muscle damage in the abdominal region and his condition will continue to be monitored over the coming days.
As the build-up to Frosinone picks up pace, Juve's Tuscan boss Allegri will answer the media's questions tomorrow at Juventus Center from 12.00 CEST. As ever, live tweets of his press conference can be followed on the club's official Twitter account @juventusfcen.

A team's eagerness to go after a particular player in the NFL draft often speaks volumes.
When the Bears traded up from the third to the second overall pick in the 2017 NFL draft to take North Carolina quarterback Mitchell Trubisky, general manager Ryan Pace made it clear—in his mind, Trubisky is a franchise quarterback.
"If we want to be great, you just can't sit on your hands," Pace told reporters about the decision to trade up for Trubisky, which cost the Bears third- and fourth-round picks in 2017 as well as a third-rounder in 2018. "There are times when you've got to be aggressive, and when you have conviction on a guy, you can't sit on your hands. I just don't want to be average around here; I want to be great. And these are the moves you have to make."
In the NFL, it's common sense that if the quarterback you want is available, you move heaven and earth to get him. But in Trubisky's case, there has to be some projection involved. He started just one season in college, completing 68 percent of his passes for 3,748 yards, 30 touchdowns and six interceptions in 2016. When you watch his tape, it's evident he has a way to go before he's ready for the NFL. His mechanics and field-reading are inconsistent, though he does show most of the tools you want in a top-tier NFL quarterback. He just has to overcome certain tendencies before it will be evident on a consistent basis.
Nam Y. Huh/Associated Press
"All the traits as far as leadership, how he is with his teammates, what his work ethic is like and all the physical traits as well—the accuracy," Pace said when asked why there was such urgency to trade for Trubisky. "All these top quarterbacks, it's just their ability to quickly process defenses, process coverage, find open targets, not panic under pressure, deliver accurate throws when there's a noisy pocket and things are collapsing. And Mitch has those traits."
It's also evident the Bears do not expect Trubisky to show those traits right away. They signed former Buccaneers quarterback Mike Glennon to a three-year, $45 million deal in March, and though the team can cut him loose with a minimal salary-cap hit after 2017, the Bears clearly see Trubisky as a developmental guy. Based on his work in college, that's the right way to go.
"We feel we have the perfect environment for his development," Pace said. "In regards to Mike Glennon, Mike Glennon is our starting quarterback. There is no quarterback competition when Mitch gets here. Glennon is our starting quarterback. We'll focus on Mitch's development and Mike Glennon winning games for the Chicago Bears."
What the Bears are trying to avoid is the crucible of throwing a quarterback to the wolves too soon. And there are certainly stories of young signal-callers being ruined for good when teams try to hurry them into the spotlight—Blake Bortles in Jacksonville is a recent glaring example. The Jaguars wanted to sit Bortles as a rookie after taking him third overall in the 2014 draft, but injuries to starter Chad Henne scuttled that plan. Jacksonville threw Bortles into the fire before he was ready, and he's never quite recovered. It's hard for any young quarterback to bounce back from that.
The NFL demands far more of quarterbacks than any college program ever could. Mechanics are far more important. The coverage windows are inches wide when they used to be feet wide. Coverages are infinitely more complex, and the pass-rush schemes and sub-packages are from another world.
In that regard, Pace and his evaluators are on the right track. The question then becomes whether Trubisky has the raw and transferable skills to make this deal worth the trouble.
Let's go to the tape.
Trubisky faced some of the NCAA's better defenses in his one starting year, so there are multiple opportunities to see him dealing with adversity and working through the inevitable kinks that come up against high-quality opponents.
From a physical perspective, it's easy to see why NFL teams would be enamored with Trubisky. He measured 6'2" and 222 pounds at the combine. His height could be an issue since he has somewhat of a sidearm delivery, but he's a big, mobile guy who can make plays both in the pocket and outside of it. He also rushed 93 times for 308 yards and five touchdowns in 2016, and the Tar Heels had him electing to run on a number of read-option packages. At times, Trubisky would take the ball up the middle for negligible gains—the Bears likely won't want him to do that—but he's a credible threat on the ground regardless.
This two-play sequence against Miami shows the boom-and-bust nature of Trubisky as a pure runner. On the first play, he's bottled up, he doesn't see anything downfield, and nothing happens. But on the second play, the lanes open up and he's off to the races. Trubisky has promising agility in short spaces, he's not afraid to take a hit, and he touts impressive second-level acceleration.
DraftBreakdown.com
Another element of Trubisky's physicality shows up in this completion against Miami, and it's something the Bears can build on: He isn't afraid to throw when there are bodies around or on him. Here, Trubisky makes the completion outside to receiver Bug Howard despite the backside defensive end having beaten his blocker. This calm demeanor as things are falling apart around him brings Philip Rivers to mind.

This second-quarter completion against Stanford in the Sun Bowl is another positive example of how Trubisky can maintain the play even after his pocket breaks down. Here, end Solomon Thomas (No. 90) forced Trubisky to step up in the pocket, and with other bodies coming at him, he deduced that he's better off running to the right. He ran to throw—he kept his eyes up, waited for receiver Jordan Cunningham to run his crossing route and put the ball where only Cunningham could get it.
According to Pro Football Focus, Trubisky was accurate on 66.7 percent of his passes under pressure, and there are enough examples of his ability in and out of the pocket under pressure to deem this a repeatable and crucial part of his game.
However, Trubisky's inexperience shows up when he's asked to make reads against complex defenses. Stanford safety Dallas Lloyd had two interceptions against him in the Sun Bowl, and they're both worth watching.
On the first pick in the second quarter, Lloyd is coming down to linebacker depth pre-snap, clearly looking to take away anything intermediate across the middle. It's not a disguised coverage—Lloyd makes his intentions clear. But Trubisky still makes the throw on a right-side slant, and Lloyd can easily jump the route. These are the kinds of things that NFL quarterbacks must diagnose pre-snap to succeed.
DraftBreakdown.com
The fourth-quarter interception to Lloyd is just as disconcerting, because it again shows a lack of ability to pre-read coverage changes. Here, Lloyd is coming down from safety depth pre-snap, and as the cornerback follows the outside receiver running inside, all he has to do is sit underneath and wait to jump the running back's boundary route. Stanford's defense clearly has this worked out, and it's bothersome that Trubisky couldn't see it. As is true for many college quarterbacks, once you get him out of his clearest series of first progressions, he doesn't always have an adequate response.
DraftBreakdown.com
"What I like about Mitch is he's very humble, and he's never going to be a guy that's going to point fingers," Pace said of Trubisky's mistakes against Stanford. "I think it's just hey, reading defenses. In that instance, there were a couple of plays there. What I like is his ability to come to the sidelines, regroup, talk to his coaches, and then go back out and execute at a high level. We always talk about people responding in adverse situations, and he did that."
It's true Trubisky did rally his team late in the game; the Tar Heels lost, 25-23, but Trubisky was one sack on a final two-point conversion away from tying the game with less than 30 seconds remaining. North Carolina's final touchdown drive was marred by multiple receiver drops and a great defensive effort on a fade route in the end zone, but the scoring play was a thing of beauty—and yet another example of how naturally Trubisky can make things happen outside of structure. He first rolls to his right, and after doubling back to his left, he needs to find someone in the end zone, Fortunately, Bug Howard is there.
DraftBreakdown.com
One element of randomness in Trubisky's play is that he'll overthrow open receivers, which has more to do with his overall mechanics than any glaring inaccuracy. Here, against Miami, he has an overload blitz to his right, and he's making a quick throw to the other side. But he lifts his body and pushes the ball, throwing what should be a fairly simple downfield completion over the head of receiver Mack Hollins. Trubisky does have a tendency to push the ball, especially when he's trying to finesse the arc of a throw, which will have to be corrected.

Does Trubisky have what it takes to validate the Bears' investment in him? From a basic physical perspective, he has plenty of positives—he's tough, mobile and fearless in the pocket. He doesn't bail from pressure, and though there are times when he'll leave the pocket early, it's not an epidemic issue. His arm is above-average, though he doesn't have a cannon for an arm—there are times when he makes deep throws and his receivers have to come back to the ball. He may have more velocity in his future if he gets his mechanics straightened out.
Most of his issues have to do with experience. He's below-average when it comes to reading defenses and coverages at this point, and against advanced schemes and disguised coverages in the NFL, he'd get eaten alive. This is compounded with the aforementioned inaccuracy that pops up when he regresses mechanically. He will also need to learn to play within the pocket, and within structure, more consistently. Offensive coordinator Dowell Loggains and quarterbacks coach Dave Ragone will likely prioritize rounding out Trubisky's skill set. It would be a stretch to expect any quarterback to be ready for the NFL after one starting year, and it's clear Trubisky isn't.
That's where the question gets difficult. If you're making this kind of trade for a quarterback, you clearly believe that he's a franchise-transformer like Andrew Luck or Aaron Rodgers. For now, Trubisky doesn't demonstrate that potential. He has nice attributes, and there are times when one could envision him developing into an above-average NFL quarterback based on his college tape. But above all, quarterbacking in the NFL is about the ability to repeatedly and consistently make plays under difficult circumstances, and against all kinds of defenses.
Trubisky needs time before it can be determined whether he's such a player, and the merit of the trade will only become evident a few years down the road. Hopefully, the weight of what the Bears gave up for him won't skew the development plan in the short term.

The final (I hope) version of my Concorde. This time the engines get all the air they need so it reaches a maximum speed of about 1100 mph. And the most important, now it has a fully functional droop nose landing gear, and reverse thrust. Handling is bad at high speeds because I can't turn off the elevons at the edges of the wings.
Special controls: to retract the main landing gear activate activation group 1, hold down brake and while holding it down deactivate activation group 1, the landing gear will retract and lock. To extract the landing gear double press activation group 1. Also remember to retract the rear bumper to reduce drag.
To move the droop nose use the same method as the landing gear but with actuvation group 3.
For reverse thrust you also use the same method but with x/z (yaw buttons) instead of brake, and activation group 2.
To get a better understanding of how to use the controls, watch that video http://youtu.be/o_unWTok7d0
You can modify the plane and use parts from it as much as you like, but please give me credit if you do. Enjoy :)
A huge explosion has rocked the diplomatic quarter of Kabul, where international embassies, including that of the US, are located, as well as the Afghan Defense Ministry.
An official from the Afghan Interior Ministry, Mohammad Hamayun Aini, confirmed that the explosion had occurred to Pajhwok News.
Flash: A bomb blast in PD9 near to US embassy in Kabul. — Pajhwok Afghan News (@pajhwok) August 15, 2016
The blast went off in the Macrorayan area of Kabul when a magnetic Improvised explosive device (IED) was placed on a vehicle belonging to the Afghan National Army (ANA). According to Pajhwok, an ANA vehicle was the target of the attack, which took place near the Defense Ministry.
An Afghan National Army (ANA) soldier was injured in the blast,
There have also been reports suggesting that the blast took place near Maiwand Bank.
Kabul was the site of a huge attack plotted by the Islamic State terrorist group (IS, formerly ISIS/ISIL) that targeted a mass demonstration in July, when several blasts left at least 80 people dead and 231 injured.
Navigating the nuances of Scotch—whether you're a beginner or an intermediate drinker—is tough, especially if you don't know what you're looking for. To help, we enlisted Beth Havers, a whisky expert from the fine folks over at the Glenfiddich and Balvenie distilleries, to show us how to isolate the individual flavour profiles of her favourite whiskies by pairing them with the perfect foods—not to mention how to use the rest of your senses to decode the dram's finer details. Read on, and soon you'll be appreciating notes of vanilla, cinnamon and stewed apples like the pros.
Flavour Profile: Fruity
Scotch: Glenfiddich 12-year-old
Where it gets its flavour: “The predominant notes are notes of pear, a touch of vanilla and a little bit of spice. That pear note that you're finding is something that's developed through our distillation process, and as it develops as we age in the barrels, it turns into different types of fruit from a pear note into a baked apple and so on.”
Food pairings to isolate the fruity notes: “When thinking about Scotch and food, it can really pair with the vast majority of types of flavours. But something that would go with really nicely to start your evening off is a canape. A toasted crostini with Brie cheese and a slice of pear would be a beautiful complement to the Glenfiddich 12-year-old.”
Why it works: “The saltiness of the cheese will really contrast the sweetness of the whisky, so you're balancing the two flavours. You're also complementing them by adding the flavour that your tasting as well, the slice of fresh pear.”
Flavour Profile: Spicy
Scotch: Glenfiddich 18-year-old
Where it gets its flavour: “70 per cent of [flavours] come from the wood. We use old sherry and bourbon barrels for our whiskies, and add other barrels for finishing purposes. As we age longer, you create a lot more depth of character. Something more robust would be the Glenfiddich 18. You use the same types of barrels to age the 12 and the 18, but those additional six years in the bourbon barrels and sherry has really mellowed the flavours. The taste profile becomes something more hearty… it has more robust, spicy notes of apple and that cinnamon-type spice.”
Food pairings to isolate the spicy notes: “This would be your red wine of whisky, your Cabernet Sauvignon. You could pair it with a nice beef tenderloin, or lamb; this kind of things really pair nicely with the Glenfiddich 18-year-old.”
Why it works: “It's really quite different than the last whisky—the 12-year-old is bright and lively and really fresh, and this is a mellow, more robust kind of flavour that can stand against bigger, bolder tastes in your meal such as savoury red meat and hearty vegetables.”
Flavour Profile: Floral
Scotch: Balvenie 12-year-old Single Barrel
Where it gets its flavour: “What we're about to launch in Canada is the Balvenie 12-year-old Single Barrel, which is already available in the US. What that means is it's whisky that comes from one single cask, not a number of casks. It's all done in bourbon barrels, that's it. After 12 years, it is left with a really nice, light floral note, and after being done in just the bourbon barrels, it also has a lot of vanilla notes as well. It becomes more on the fresh and lively part of the spectrum.”
Food pairings to isolate the floral notes: “Those floral notes would really complement something almost honied—it would pair quite nicely with a lighter dessert, not something like a deep, heavy chocolate cake, like along the lines of [a creme fraiche with rose syrup] or a creme brulee.”
Why it works: “The creaminess of a creme brulee specifically would pair very well with the Balvenie 12-year-old Single Barrel, because it would complement the vanilla and floral notes that you're getting with this whisky [without overpowering them].”
Flavour Profile: Smoky
Scotch: Glenfiddich 15-year-old Distillery Edition
Where it gets its flavour: “The Distillery Edition is unique to our portfolio because it has a higher alcohol by volume, it's released at 51 per cent. We use two different types of barrels to age it, the bourbon and also the sherry. However, it doesn't go through a certain process called chill filtration. It's the way whisky was made 125 years ago when we first opened our distillery. That effect leaves you with that more smoky type of note; it's not a smoke from the peat, but it's smoke from the actual wood—smoky, slightly leathery, [it's] more pronounced than the fruit.”
Food pairings to isolate the smoky notes: “It would really stand up to something like a blue cheese and fig salad, or something [similarly] smokey as well. A smoked salmon would especially pair well with this. It's [also] very interesting to see what happens to it when you add a little bit of water, how those flavours change.”
Why it works: “As a slightly stronger type of whisky, it can stand up to any blue type of cheese, such as Blue Stilton, unlike the earlier Glenfiddich 15, which might need a lighter dessert.”
Flavour Profile: Sweet
Scotch: Glenfiddich 15-year-old Solera Reserve
Where it gets its flavour: “The Glenfiddich 15-year-old Solera Reserve, we only use three types of oak barrels to age it: bourbon, sherry and new oak. You're getting a lot of vanilla flavours from the bourbon and you're getting some fruit flavours from the sherry, and then you're also incorporating spice from the new oak.”
Food pairings to isolate the smoky notes: “All those flavours meld together, and the taste profile is very sweet. We've partnered with a chocolate truffle make in Toronto called Stubbe Chocolate and Pastry, and they've made this gorgeous truffle incorporating this whisky. If you were doing something on your own and wanted something to pair with it, dark chocolate, a molten lava chocolate cake or typically anything on the dark side of the chocolate spectrum (over 70 per cent cocoa) would pair very well.”
Why it works: “Something sweet—but not too sweet—complements the whisky without overpowering it, raising the underlying sweet and spicy fruit, honey and sherry notes in the Scotch.”
Flavour Profile: Woody
Scotch: Balvenie 12-year-old Doublewood
Where it gets its flavour: “The 12-year-old Doublewood we age using two different types of barrels—bourbon and Oloroso sherry. First, we age it in bourbon for 12 years, and then switch that entire production over into casks that previously held Oloroso sherry, where we just allow it for a finishing period [of] about nine months. What we want to do is give it just a kiss of those sherry notes without becoming overly sherried, because sherry has a more powerful effect on whiskies than a bourbon barrel does. With the balance of those two, you're getting lots of sweetness from the sherry and fruit components, which are complemented by the vanilla from the bourbon, and oakiness on the nose, because it has spent so much time in oak.”
Food pairings to isolate the woody notes: “For this one, you can definitely add water, just a drop often does change that nose significantly and open it up. You could pair it really nicely with any course of your meal, but this would be a good whisky paired with gorgonzola stuffed dates, or even prosciutto and melon.”
Why it works: “The Doublewood is really versatile, and you could pair it with oftentimes just with a dessert due to the sweet sherry and vanilla bourbon influences, but adding something salty or savoury can contrast the sweeter side while emphasizing its smokier notes as well.”
Flavour Profile: Winey
Scotch: Balvenie 21-year-old PortWood
Where it gets its flavour: “It's aged first in bourbon for 21 years, and finished in port casks. Port casks to be used in whisky distilleries, they're very, very large, and once we get them at the distillery, they're often quite old. They've been in port production for 20 plus years, so they're really rich in flavour. We leave it in for about six months to get those really nice port notes, like fruit flavours, kissed upon the whisky. It's extremely elegant, and after 21 years the flavours are so mellow.”
Food pairings to isolate the woody notes: “This would pair really well with a beef tenderloin, or a main course like filet mignon.”
Why it works: “It acts much like a wine due to its heaviness, meaning it can stand up to bigger flavours. Rather than a fresher grape profile, it would be more of a raisin or fortified wine taste, with a little bit of spice, nuts and honey that are subtly added.”

How to decode the finer details
Nosing: Nosing means taking a whiff, but Havers recommends not sticking your nose right into the glass. Whisky is typically made with a high alcohol by volume, to the tune of 40 to 46 per cent, so hold it about an inch away from your nose, leaving your mouth ajar, and take a deep breath through the nose. Alcohol will initially get in the way, but underneath, pay attention to notes belonging to the flavour profiles we've just covered. Start at identifying the more basic categories: vanilla, fruit and so on. Then, try to identify the notes, seeing if you can nose out the nuances of pear, apple, stewed fruit and more.
Colour: Colour can tell you a lot about where a whisky has been. A golden or straw hue usually comes from bourbon barrels, not unlike those Glenfiddich and Balvenie use in their production. That golden hue gets deeper over the years, giving you an idea of the Scotch's age. Sherry casks will lend the Scotch a red colour that gets picked up by the whisky very quickly, and its redness also gets richer with age. However, if you added a few drops of distilled water to your dram and it suddenly turns cloudy, don't worry—you didn't break it. Whiskies with an ABV over 46 per cent that are not chill-filtered often become murky or oily as they interact with water.
Viscosity: As a rule of thumb, the older a whisky, the creamier and richer it feels on your palette. It helps you tell its age right off the bat, especially in blind tastings. However, the effect has been mimicked by younger whiskies, so don't go by age when you're choosing a favourite—find the one you enjoy.
Label: As both a new or intermediate whisky drinker, you might look at seemingly more commercial labels such as Johnnie Walker Blue, Highland Park or The Macallan and dismiss them in lieu of hard-to-pronounce labels such as Auchentoshan. Havers assured us that high quantity doesn't necessarily mean low quality—so get out there, and try a few out uninhibited.
Located in Galway, Ireland, Romero Games is a game development studio looking for a few great developers.
20 November 2015 -- Romero Games Ltd., a new video game company led by game industry veterans John and Brenda Romero is to open in Galway, Ireland. John Romero is best known for his work on DOOM and Quake while Brenda Romero best known for her work on the Wizardry and Dungeons & Dragons series. Romero Games is an Irish-based game company.
In establishing the new company, Romero Games worked with Enterprise Ireland and their High-Potential Start Up Unit to assess feasibility, determine opportunities and answer critical questions about the tech landscape in Ireland. The company plans to hire 20 to 30 programmers, artists and game designers in its Galway studio as they ramp their team toward full production. Currently, the company is in pre-production on two different game titles.
“After spending a significant amount of time in Ireland while studying the Irish game scene, game institutions and government programs, it was clear that Ireland is a top-tier tech destination,” said John Romero.
In particular, Mr. Romero highlighted Enterprise Ireland's willingness and ability to make a very complicated venture — moving internationally to establish a new Irish company — a relatively straightforward process. “We knew Ireland was an amazing destination for tech companies. A look at the companies already here told us that. Enterprise Ireland convinced us, answered dozens of questions and in general, sealed the deal.”
Brenda Romero, co-founder of Romero Games also cited Ireland's existing game and tech infrastructure, cheaper cost of living as compared to US-based tech hubs, educated workforce and strong university programmes.
Romero Games is located in Galway, Ireland.
The agency is being forced to play catch-up in a complex situation of which it has limited knowledge. Turkey's cooperation may be vital
Khalil Hamra / AP Members of the Free Syrian Army hold their weapons, one with a painting of the revolutionary flag, as they stand guard at a checkpoint on the outskirts of Idlib, Syria.
According to the New York Times, the CIA now has people deployed in Turkey trying to sort out which Syrian rebels should be armed, and which shouldn't. That comes as no real surprise, in light of Syria spinning into worse chaos and violence, and the Obama Administration running out of good options. Isn't the CIA always called in when nothing else works?
I'll go out on a limb here and guess that, right now, the last situation the CIA wants to get into is Syria. Like the rest of the world, it knows next to nothing about the Syrian opposition, which is a mare's nest of secular and religious groups. There is no one predominant figure, which leaves the CIA to sort out competing claims to political leadership and support. And, as these things usually go, it will take a lot of time to sort out the swindlers and the frauds from the real thing. A large number of Syrian exiles are in it for the money, rather than supporting, much less representing the fighters dying on Syria's battlefields.
(PHOTOS: Syria's Year of Chaos: Images of a Slow-Motion Civil War)
It should also be remembered that the CIA has had a long, unhappy history playing Syrian politics. In the 1960s, one of its operatives was accused of trying to foment a coup, and was hanged in Damascus's central square. After Syria put down the Hama rebellion in February 1982, it found U.S.-made radio equipment in the rubble, and wrongly accused the CIA of having supported the uprising. Both State Department and the CIA came to an informal understanding that the CIA would keep away from the Syrian opposition — and it, in fact, did just that for the following three decades. So right now, the CIA is playing catch-up.
Turning the CIA on Syria is a sign that the Administration has been put in a corner not of its own making. That's because there are no easy or obvious solutions to the Syrian conflict. When the Arab Spring first reached Syria in March 2011, the Washington's hope was that Syrian President Bashar Assad would open up Syria to some sort of democracy and defuse dissent. Then, when the power struggle turned violent, the Administration latched on to the hope that a Syrian general would overthrow Bashar.
But what Washington missed was that the minority-led Alawite regime from the beginning was blinded by a siege mentality that didn't allow for any dissent. Either you're with us or you're against us was the mentality. Sacrificing Bashar — no matter how badly he'd botched it — would be tantamount to surrender.
As the military confrontation escalated, the regime decided to hand out weapons to the so-called shabihah — irregular militas made up of Alawites and Christians, set loose on Sunni communities supporting the uprising. The regime never had any illusions it could control such groups, or restrain them from waging pogroms against civilians. But the arithmetic was compelling: There simply weren't enough loyal units in the army to hold all the territory being contested by the rebels.
(READ: How the U.S. Is Using Technology to Aid Syria's Rebels)
To add to the mess the CIA's been handed, all of the Syrian opposition groups and rebels are already spoken for in one way or another. Turkey has its favorites, as does Jordan. The most militant Islamic factions are supported by Qatar, where Syria's Muslim Brotherhood long ago set up shop. The Qatari authorities may know the Syrian Brotherhood better than anyone, but it doesn't mean Qatar will open its files to the Americans.
And let's not forget the regional conflict. Saudi Arabia believes that if the Syrian regime falls, it will be an enormous setback for Riyadh's two enemies — Iran, and Lebanon's Hizballah. The Saudis would celebrate it as an even exchange for the influence it has lost to Iran in Iraq.
The permutations of the Syrian conflict would short-circuit Talleyrand's most complicated realpolitik calculations. And even the legendary French diplomat would be loathe to predict what would happen to Syria if more arms were sent in. Another Somalia or Yemen?
In the dark of the night, there's little doubt Obama Administration officials whisper to each other that they wish Syria would go back to the status quo ante, that somehow the conflict will die down and go away. As anyone who knows Syria could have told us, democracy is never the way to transition out of a totalitarian minority regime.
But in the meantime, the Obama administration is right to side with Turkey. Turkey understands Syria — and militant Islam — better than the United States does. Turkey has no doubt greenlighted the CIA's working with the Syrian rebels, and that's a good sign. Let's hope it continues.

Two of the most prominent names in Wilmington's nascent startup community are joining forces.
The coding boot camp Zip Code Wilmington will move one block southwest this summer to an as-yet unfinished section of The Mill, a coworking space on the fourth floor of the Nemours Building.
The new space will give Zip Code room to add a second programming course while ensuring their new headquarters is designed to meet the school's needs.
Head of School Melanie Augustin said the move has benefits beyond meeting the nonprofit's practical needs.
"There's certainly a lot of synergy being here with the energy they have at The Mill," she said. "The startup atmosphere and innovation that's going on is what we're really looking forward to being a part of and contributing to, as well."

RELATED:New economic development plan for Delaware revealed
For The Mill, landing Zip Code as a tenant means filling the third and final phase of construction – a 7,200-square-foot wing slated for completion by Sept. 1.
Founder Robert Herrara said incorporating the intensive coding school into the lineup of startups and "solopreneurs" already at The Mill will help cement the new economy culture he's trying to build.
"I think we're both two exciting ventures in Wilmington that are changing the perception of downtown," he said. "And I think this is one of those cases where one plus one doesn't equal two. It equals 10."
Both Zip Code and The Mill are technically startups themselves.
Founded by a pair of du Pont heirs and the CEO of Epic Research, Zip Code began offering intensive, 12-week courses in the computer programming language Java in late 2015. The school provides graduates with a 6-month job at one of a dozen Delaware businesses. Those employers pay a placement fee that covers all but $3,000 of the students' tuition, while paying graduates an average salary $62,000 year.
Currently located on the third floor of the I.M. Pei Building at 1105 Market St., the school was recognized by former President Barack Obama as a model for the nation before it even began.

To date, Zip Code has trained 117 Java developers while posting an 87 percent graduation rate. Most who finish the course land a full-time job within three months of graduating, Augustin said.
The school now has four instructors and plans to add a small course for 5 to 10 students in the programming languages Javascript and Python after the move.
"Right now with our current space, if our alumni decide to come back for an event, we can't accommodate them," said Tariq Hook, Zip Code's director of education. "But The Mill has plenty of spillover space for tutors, mentors, events or whatever."
The Mill became Wilmington's premier coworking space when its 12,000-square-foot Phase I wing opened last April. A second, 10,000-square-foot wing was completed last month.
The space now includes about 20 private offices, some with room for just one to two people, while others can fit four to eight. The Mill offers another 34 rentable desks available for $350 a month and four conference rooms available on a first-come, first-serve basis. Roughly 60 "solopreneurs" and freelancers also have paid a $45 community membership fee to set up shop at a 28-foot, custom-built docking station or several sit-stand desks.

All members get free Wi-Fi access, a discount card to area restaurants and CoreTen Fitness on the first floor, access to The Mill's full kitchen and working bar sponsored by Dogfish Head Brewery, and the opportunity to hold events in Theatre N, the art house theater in the same building.
Augustin and Hook said they hope Zip Code's closer proximity to those entrepreneurs will inspire students, give them a better sense of how the skills they are learning can be applied to the real world and allow them to form relationships that could lead to future employment.
"I'm really hoping some mentorships develop," Augustin said. "I'd love to see some of our Zip Coders form their own startups."
Current tenants at The Mill say they are equally excited about the arrival of Zip Code.
Kevin Dombrowski, a senior vice president of global business development for the publicly-traded investment research firm Morningstar, works remotely from a one-man office at The Mill.
"I think Zip Code is one of those exciting education disruptors that does the whole public-private thing right," he said. "I think it's one of the most exciting, new things going on in Wilmington. Bringing them to The Mill will only bring additional energy and creativity to what's going on here."

When President-elect Donald Trump successfully demanded that Carrier keep some manufacturing jobs from going to Mexico, he was criticized at first for bullying the heating and cooling giant and for violating the Republican Party's free-market capitalist ethos.
In the eight weeks since, however, the atmosphere has changed dramatically. Almost daily, in Twitter missives as well as private meetings, Trump continues to hector businesses to make investments in the United States. And he is receiving credit for announcements from some of the world's biggest corporations — Bayer AG, General Motors and Walmart just this week — that they are keeping or adding U.S. jobs, even if their plans were developed long before his agitations.
Trump is trying to put the bully back into the bully pulpit, modeling his governing style after Theodore Roosevelt, the president whose attacks on industry barons inspired the term.
The Trump strategy is to change the behavior of corporations — not to mention the intelligence community and other creatures of Washington — through force of intimidation. His advisers talk about the president-elect's provocations, such as threatening a 35 percent tax on imports, not as policy destinations necessarily, but as boundaries designed to frame the discussion and instill fear in corporate boardrooms.
“Trump understands that if you change the culture, the behavior follows,” said former House speaker Newt Gingrich, a Trump ally and informal adviser. “He wants to create a Trumpian environment so that boards go into a meeting saying, ‘No, we're not leaving the U.S.' ”
(Daron Taylor/The Washington Post)
Trump's demands on the business community are among the most notable actions of the pre-inaugural period. The list of major companies announcing U.S. jobs in recent weeks has ranged from Hyundai Motor to Amazon, and in each case Trump and his aides have trumpeted their announcements and claimed credit.
[The real reason Ford abandoned its plant in Mexico has little to do with Trump]
It is unclear, however, how much the president-elect's threats influenced their actual business plans, which are months or years in the making and determined by an array of factors. The unemployment rate has remained at 5 percent or lower for more than a year, and many companies have been expanding their operations.
“The word is now out that when you want to move your plant to Mexico or some other place, and you want to fire all of your workers from Michigan and Ohio and all these places that I won, for good reason — not going to happen that way anymore,” Trump said at his first post-election news conference last week.
Corporate America has quickly adapted to Trump's new posture. Fear permeates “C-suites,” where executives are trying to come up with ways to please the incoming president and avoid his wrath, according to people whose work places them in the nexus of business and politics.
William M. Daley, a financier and business executive who has served as White House chief of staff under President Obama and as secretary of commerce under former president Bill Clinton, said, “CEOs want to play nice because they're afraid of getting caught in a Twitter storm.”
“They would never call his bluff,” Daley said. “They're scared to death. They'll run to the Congress and say, ‘Oh, save us from this.' It's a good M.O., because he knows these guys will roll over the minute he puts his sights on them.”

Scott Reed, chief strategist for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, said companies are motivated in part by what they see as a “positive business environment” under the Trump administration, which has vowed to overhaul the tax code as well as loosen environmental, financial and other regulations.
“The business community is practical and pragmatic, and looking forward to engaging with the new administration in a constructive manner,” Reed said. “This was a change election, and we like that the country is now upbeat and optimistic about real economic growth in the 3 percent to 4 percent range.”
[How a week of Trump tweets stoked anxiety, moved markets and altered plans]
Trump is a modern-day Roosevelt, who from the White House in the 1900s demonized banks, railroads and other businesses he viewed as insufficiently nationalist.
“Roosevelt's bully pulpit was very ardently about going after companies and wealthy people that weren't putting America first, that were putting their profits ahead of public goodwill,” said Douglas Brinkley, a presidential historian and Roosevelt biographer. “He did it with his fingers pointed in the face of his enemies. He would call bankers out by name.”
In the century since Roosevelt served, Brinkley said, no president has used the bully pulpit to strong-arm companies in such a relentless and aggressive manner — until Trump.
“Other presidents would show up at the Harley factory and say, ‘This is made in America. Isn't that wonderful?' ” Brinkley said. “But they would never go into a mano-a-mano war about bringing jobs back to America, not since Theodore Roosevelt.”
Trump said in an interview last week with The Washington Post that his early moves to badger Boeing and Lockheed Martin to bring down the costs of their aircraft — Air Force One and the F-35 fighter jet, respectively — were examples of the power of his voice.
“Look at what's going on with the airplanes, the F-35. We're saving such amounts of money. Look at what's going on with Air Force One. Look at what's going on with the auto plants,” Trump said. “And by the way, I'm not micromanaging.”
Whether Trump considers it micromanaging, he is undeniably meddling in the affairs of private companies to a greater degree than many previous presidents.
“Trump is in many ways closer to a governor than to our traditional model of president,” Gingrich said. “Governors around the country all behave like Trump: They worry about specific jobs, specific factories, specific companies. The Washington model is always abstract policy. But he's gone straight for the jugular to say, ‘I want jobs!' ”
Gingrich described the president-elect as a tireless entrepreneur determined to see results, and recalled Trump's management of the Wollmann Rink in New York's Central Park. The outdoor skating rink was in disrepair in the 1980s when Trump persuaded then-Mayor Ed Koch to take over the renovations himself. The rink reopened with great fanfare, under budget and ahead of schedule, becoming one of Trump's biggest success stories, which he later chronicled in his 1987 bestseller, “The Art of the Deal.”
Trump's focus on pressuring companies to create U.S. jobs could be politically advantageous. He owes his electoral victory to the Rust Belt — Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, whose manufacturing-based economies have been decimated over the past four decades by outsourcing and broader trends of globalization.
“He understands better than anybody on his team that there are two criteria for his reelection: Is America safe, and did we create jobs?” Gingrich said. “If he can run with genuine prosperity — not this phony statistical prosperity that's all baloney — then he's golden.”
Brinkley agreed: “He's going to live or die by jobs. He can get away with a lot of eccentric activity if he stays out of war and if the economy does well.”

The NPD group has released its monthly US sales report for December and announced the top-selling games for the entire year.
This report comes with a new disclaimer, which notes it "provides both online and retail sales results for new physical video game products, as well as a subset of full-game digital downloads from participating publishers in NPD's digital panel. It is not intended to cover total market/total consumer spend."
With that in mind, we have gotten more information than usual. In addition to the typical list of top-selling games (in terms of dollar sales) across all platforms, it's also provided platform-specific lists for December. This shows that, while Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare and Final Fantasy XV were the top two games overall, the latter was No. 3 on Xbox One, but No. 1 on PS4. Infinite Warfare and Battlefield 1 (the No. 3 game on PS4) were the top two games on Xbox One.
The report also includes a look at the top-selling games for the entire year in the US, and Infinite Warfare--even with its sales dip--unsurprisingly came out on top. What might stand out most in this list are the two games to make the top 10 that released prior to 2016: Grand Theft Auto V (No. 6) and Call of Duty: Black Ops III (No. 8).
Total video game sales--combining hardware, software, and accessories--were down 15 percent year-over-year from $3.2 billion to $2.7 billion in the US during December. Hardware saw the biggest drop, going from $1.24 billion in December 2015 to $994.9 million in December 2016.
"[T]he release of the Xbox One S and the PlayStation 4 Pro did not generate dollar-spending growth," said NPD analyst Sam Naji. "Although the combined [average retail price] for the Xbox One and PlayStation 4 systems decreased by 15 percent, consumers bought seven percent fewer units."
In recent months, Sony has ceased to provide comments on NPD reports. We learned last week that PS4 outsold Xbox One in the US during December, while Microsoft boasted that its console was the top-seller over the second half of 2016. Today's NPD report added that Xbox One sales were up 10 percent in December compared with December 2015.
In a statement shared with GameSpot, Nintendo talked up the performance of 3DS (while making no mention of Wii U). It didn't share specific hardware sales numbers, but it did say 3DS enjoyed year-over-year growth for the seventh month in a row during December. It also noted that 3DS was the only game system to sell more in 2016 than it did in 2015. NES Classic Edition sales were up 14 percent in December as compared with November (when it launched), according to the NPD Group.
As for software, first-party 3DS games sold 7.3 million units in the US during the final three months of 2016. Nintendo said this makes it the best-selling quarter for 3DS software sales ever. It attributed this to new releases Pokémon Sun/Moon, Super Mario Maker, and Mario Party: Star Rush, as well as older titles like Mario Kart 7 and Super Smash Bros. Sun and Moon have combined to sell 4.5 million units in the US so far.
You can see all of the lists NPD shared below. For a comparison, you can check out the best-selling games in November 2016 here and all of 2015 here.
These lists are ranked in terms of dollar sales and combine physical sales with digital sales from select publishers (notable absences include Nintendo and sales through Battle.net) in the US. Games marked with an asterisk are those that don't include digital sales. December's charts cover November 27 through December 31, while the full-year chart runs from January 3 through December 31.

This one is going to make you laugh.
A dog owner hears something that sounds like a banging or knocking coming from the doorway, and goes to investigate the strange noise.
What she finds is her adorable yellow lab who has found quite the stick out in the yard, and he just wants to bring it inside.
But, though he found the perfect stick, it's not quite the perfect fit.
He can't get it through the doorway!
It's not for lack of trying, as he continues to try and make it through the door holding the giant stick in his mouth.
His owner is simply watching, filming, and laughing hysterically at his efforts.
He doesn't quite understand that he needs to turn sideways and bring the stick in long-ways if he wants to get it inside.
He just keeps trying the same thing over and over, which is clearly not going to work.
Maybe if he dropped it and tried to drag it inside long-ways, that would have worked, but he just doesn't think through the problem.
Eventually, he is forced to give up on his endeavor to bring the stick inside, and runs back out into the yard, perhaps to find a safe place for it until he can come out and play again.
Even though he doesn't manage to figure out how to get the stick inside, you will still enjoy watching his silly efforts!
Just because I happen to live with my four brothers and sisters in my mom's two-bedroom South Side apartment, work at Taco Bell, and don't have a car, some ignorant types assume that I don't have much money. But, as you can clearly see from my $220 Fubu jacket and $95 Tommy Hilfiger sweatshirt, I could not possibly be poor.
The kind of name-brand clothing I wear is very expensive. See these Karl Kani jeans? Eighty-eight dollars. Would I spend that kind of money on a pair of jeans if I were poor? Of course not. If I were poor, I'd think $88 was way too much to spend on a pair of jeans that, with the exception of a tiny Karl Kani logo embroidered on the front right pocket, are practically indistinguishable from a plain old pair of $25 Levi's. But I don't think that's too much to spend because, for a well-off person like myself, money is no object.

Sure, I make $5.90 an hour at Taco Bell, but that couldn't possibly be my only source of income, could it? If my total weekly take-home pay were only $175, why in the world would I spend practically that much on a Nautica sweater and a pair of Timberlands? That would mean I'd have spent 40 hours slinging Chalupas just for that one shopping trip to the mall. That'd just be plain stupid. So, obviously, I must be rolling in dough. And I am. You can tell by my special non-poor-people clothing.
Yes, it's obvious that I'm not like all those other losers who are working at Taco Bell and living with their moms. No, I'm a player. Take, for example, my socks. If I didn't have money to burn, I certainly wouldn't spend $22 for a pair of basic white athletic socks with a teeny-tiny Calvin Klein "CK" on them, would I? Of course not. I'd need to save my cash to get my telephone reconnected, or to pay off my loitering fine, or to help out my mom with the grocery bill. But, luckily, I'm not in that situation, and everyone knows it just by looking at my clothes.
I'll admit it: A lot of people here on the South Side are poor. In fact, most of my relatives are poor, including my mother and all my siblings. Knowing that, you might assume that I don't have that much money, either. But just look at these Lugz boots. And look at this Sean John baseball cap. They prove that I'm in an entirely different social class from my relatives, as well as from all those suckers who ride the bus with me every day.

Except for Angela, that is. I met her Monday on the C-route. She clearly belongs to a higher class of people like myself. I could tell because she was decked out from head to toe in expensive gear: Fubu jersey, Pepe jeans, and Fila shoes, not to mention a big gold chain around her neck. Angela was holding her two-year-old son, but he obviously isn't placing much of a financial strain on her, as he was wearing a complete matching Abercrombie & Fitch outfit, which must have cost around $140. Recognizing how much Angela and I had in common, I asked her out on the spot. We went to dinner at Denny's that very same night.
With hype building for the IT remake, horror fans are gearing up to return to Derry, Maine – possibly the scariest place in America to grow up. Artist Kassiopeya wanted to pay tribute to the iconic setting, and constructed this highly detailed model from a recycled stereo table.
The artist has been a fan of the novel IT since childhood, explaining “Derry is home to me; a visit there is like visiting an old friend. Like always, a walk on memory lane is associated with mixed feelings but once in a while you feel the need to take a look.”
“My Derry – including its underground world of the sewers – is now integrated in that furniture. The novel, with all its references to Rock ‘n' Roll in the Fifties has merged into a whole with that furniture, and has become part of it.”
“The surface represents the romantic sight of a Derry street bathed in the golden light of a late summer day. Only when you flip open the cabinet door do you see what is underneath: The sewage pipes way down below… in the green glowing light of the deadlights.”

Ben Roethlisberger got a preview of what has Bears fans salivating for the debut of Mitch Trubisky back before the NFL scouting combine.
The two-time Super Bowl champion met Trubisky in Irvine, Calif., and they worked out together. The veteran was quickly struck by the youngster's ability to make plays outside the pocket, which is the first thing offensive coordinator Dowell Loggains had Trubisky do during the preseason.
"I thought he was a tremendous athlete," Roethlisberger said. "I thought he could throw the ball. I thought when he got out of the pocket and made throws on the run, his improvising. … I got to watch some of his college tape. Just really impressed with the athleticism, the almost ease of throwing the ball.
"It just looked easy to him when he was on the run when it's not supposed to be super easy. Those were the most impressive things. Obviously, not sitting in a meeting room and knowing his smarts or things like that, but just the athleticism."
The get-together for the quarterbacks was arranged by Rep1 Sports, the agency that handles both quarterbacks. Roethlisberger vacations in Southern California most offseasons and will spend time with new clients in pre-draft training. So, you'd expect Roethlisberger to say glowing things about Trubisky. Still, he offers interesting insight as a quarterback who thrived as a rookie.
Physically, the ability to throw on the move and extend plays is the biggest difference between Trubisky and veteran starter Mike Glennon. It's only a matter of time until the Bears make the shift to the No. 2 draft pick. Eventually, the Bears will announce the change and say it was the "plan" all along, much in the way coach John Fox revealed before the third exhibition game that Trubisky would start the second half of that game with the first-team offense.
The Bears aren't offering any hints as to when it will be Trubisky Time. Asked if the rookie is getting any reps with the first team in practice, offensive coordinator Dowell Loggains snapped a response: "Mike Glennon is the starter."
There are plenty of examples of young quarterbacks who have been forced into action too early. They've struggled and some never rebounded. When the Steelers drafted Roethlisberger 11th in 2004, the plan was to sit him for the majority of his rookie season and maybe find a few spots to give him action. Starter Charlie Batch injured his knee in training camp and backup Tommy Maddox went out in Week 2 with an elbow injury, pressing Roethlisberger into action. The rookie went 13-0 as a starter for a team that had the No. 1 defense in the league and second-ranked rushing offense. Roethlisberger led the NFL with six game-winning drives in the fourth quarter.
"It was going into each game with the understanding that I'm not just going to manage the game, but I'm not going to put ourselves in a bad situation," Roethlisberger said. "It's just mental preparation as much as anything.
"The speed was a big deal. I thought complications of defenses (was significant). When a defense sees a young guy who hasn't played the game, they like to throw different looks at him. They're not going to line up in a 4-3 or a 3-4 base defense. They're going to throw different looks at you, different blitzes to try and confuse you. The confusion-between-the-ears part is really one of the biggest keys to it."
That's what teammates saw with Trubisky during training camp. When defensive coordinator Vic Fangio dialed up intricate pressures, the rookie looked like a rookie. The Catch-22 is that the only way for Trubisky to master all the things he's going to see is to throw him into the fire.
Roethlisberger made the interesting point that young quarterbacks are still seeing new wrinkles after their rookie season, that the maturation process is something that carries through a few seasons.
"That's why I'm always slow to send too much praise or anoint the next great quarterback after Year 1," he said. "I think people in the media and the professionals at some of these big sports networks are so quick to anoint the next great one or say that they're going to be great. Let's wait and see what happens after two to three years, after defenses understand what you're bringing. You're not a surprise anymore. I think it takes a few years until you can really get that title of understanding (if you're) great or even good. Because you see so many looks. In Year 2 and 3, you're still seeing looks and can act like a rookie."
Trubisky will get a chance to act like a rookie at some point. The Bears simply haven't revealed the plan yet.

House Democrats who voted on Thursday in favor of additional restrictions on refugees from Syria and Iraq applying for entry to the United States were met with constituents' wrath on social media, with many commenters rejecting the notion that added barriers were necessary to national security.
The Democrats were reproached for joining Republicans to give the legislation a veto-proof majority. The bill, called the American Security Against Foreign Enemies Act (Safe), would have to win a similarly large majority in the Senate to become law, which was considered unlikely.
“I am terribly disappointed in this vote,” wrote one self-identified constituent on Delaware Democrat John Carney's Facebook page. “By voting against admitting Syrian refugees, the House of Representatives has legitimated the fear that ISIS aims on spreading. This vote is rooted in baseless fear and a lack of compassion for those most deeply hurt by ISIS.”
“I'm disappointed that you're caving to fear,” a self-identified constituent wrote to Minnesota Democrat Rick Nolan. “Were the existing checks inadequate? Regretting my vote.”
Though Democrat Stephen Lynch of Massachusetts did not post on social media about his vote, he was still criticized on Facebook.
“The process in place to assess refugees was already adequate,” wrote one voter. “You're playing into fears and into the agenda of ISIS by voting for this bill. I'm ashamed that a Democrat from my state of Massachusetts would have gone along with this anti-refugee Republican legislation.”
In advance of the vote, senior Democrats in the House presented colleagues polling data showing that lawmakers who didn't support tighter restrictions would be in the sharp minority, the Huffington Post reported.
Despite the warning, only 25% of Democrats in the House supported the legislation. The 47 Democrats who voted in favor of restricting refugees came from congressional districts scattered across the country, from blue states and red states, from cities and rural areas. Only 17 of them face competitive re-election races next year, in the judgment of the Cook Political Report.
Many Democrats who voted for the bill issued similar statements explaining their thinking. After last week's Paris attacks, they said, more security was better.
President Barack Obama has said he would veto the bill, which requires all refugee cases from Syria and Iraq to be subject to an FBI background check in addition to Homeland Security Department checks.
It was unclear how much more difficult the new legislation would make the process for admitting refugees. Applicants already face daunting hurdles to admission, including in-person interviews with homeland security officials and background checks by multiple agencies, in a process that typically takes 18-24 months. The details of the checks are secret.
To date, the United States has admitted 2,034 Syrian refugees for resettlement, according to figures supplied to Congress. An estimated 4 million people have been forced out of Syria in four-and-a-half years of conflict.
Only one Democratic House member who faces a competitive re-election race next years, Elizabeth Esty of Connecticut, voted against the Safe Act.
“Not admitting refugees after an extensive and lengthy review process flies in the face of our country's moral leadership and prevents our nation from protecting vulnerable victims of the same kind of terror that struck the streets of Paris and Beirut,” Esty said in a statement.
Below is a list of the 47 Democrats who voted for the Safe Act, and links to statements they have released when available.
Sometimes, interesting discoveries occur by accident. At the Bernardino Rivadavia Natural Sciences Museum in Buenos Aires, scientists were examining the pigments of a common tree frog. The polka dot tree frog (Hypsiboas punctatus) isn't very bright; its skin is a muted yellow-green colour and it has reddish spots. However, after examining its skin under UV light, they found that it, in fact, has fluorescent skin! It glowed a very bright blue and green. The scientists were naturally quite shocked. This is the first time that fluorescence has been observed in amphibians. Although fluorescence is more common in aquatic animals (corals, sharks, fish, a sea turtle), it is very rare in land animals, being only found previously in scorpions and parrots.
How does it work?
Fluorescence first involves absorbing low wavelength light, to which frog photoreceptors aren't very sensitive. Then the light is emitted at higher wavelengths; the photoreceptors are very sensitive to these wavelengths. Therefore, there needs to be light outside for an animal to glow like this. In this regard, fluorescence is different from bioluminescence. Bioluminescence does not require any light and is created through chemical reactions.
The fluorescent molecules that this tree frog uses are completely unique. No other fluorescent animal uses anything like them! Three molecules, called hyloin-L1, hyloin-L2 and hyloin-G1, located in the lymph and skin glands were found to cause this glow. The molecular structure of the molecules involves a ring and a chain of hydrocarbons. The most similar molecules to these are found in plants.
Why fluoresce?
The fluorescence contributes 18-29% to the light available in twilight and night, making the frogs brighter and, perhaps, helping them to see more. This fluorescence could be used to communicate, camouflage, or attract a mate, though its true purpose is not known yet.
This frog is probably not the only fluorescent one out there. One of the study's authors, Dr. Julián Faivovich, thinks that it is likely that other frogs also have this property. The most promising candidates are the 250 other species of tree frogs that have translucent skin like the polka dot tree frog. He encourages other researchers studying tropical frogs to carry a UV flashlight with them.

We've all seen the big headlines over the few past few years proclaiming various new oil fields. These stories often go on to claim how the Age of Oilquarius is now upon us and we will swim and bath in seas of energy until the sun explodes and the universe ends. We are often showered with numbers and statistics that upon closer inspection don't mean anything useful at all.
Case and point is the announcement earlier this year that a large oil field had been discovered in the Australian outback. Check out these three headlines and bylines below:
Pretty heady stuff. The first headline goes straight for the Benjamins, mentioning an undefined ‘trillions of dollars' and then follows up with the astronomical number of 233 billion barrels. It ends with the George Clooney of the oil world, the country that everyone wants to be, Saudi Arabia. Where do I sign up?
The second headline also carries the money line and adds that holy grail in energy circles of ‘ENERGY INDEPENDENCE.' The headline asks us to dream of the Australian oil utopia where true blue Ozzies no longer have to buy oil from those troublesome Arabs. Neither does anyone else because Australia is now a net oil exporter! Hooray! Unfortunately they also mention that pesky detail that Coober Pedy has somewhere between 3.5 billion and 233 billion barrels of oil. One of those numbers is quite a bit bigger than the other one (we will revisit this later).
Finally we have the slightly more sober ‘transform world's oil industry' which isn't really that much more sober when you consider that the revenue for Conoco Phillips is larger than the GDP of Pakistan, the revenue for Chevron is larger than the GDP of the Czech Republic and the revenue for Exxon Mobil is larger than the GDP of Thailand, i.e when we we talk about transforming the world's oil industry we are talking about some major world changing activities.
So I hear you ask: why are these headlines so fantastic? The first reason is just one word. Hype.
1. Hype
Hype is what marketers do to sell people things they don't really want or need. The above headlines are the news story equivalent of a store proclaiming ‘up to 70% off selected items.' Never mind that once your in the store you find you don't actually want any of those luckily selected 70% off items: half the battle is already won. You are already in the shop and that greatly increases the likelihood of you buying something else .
Like stores, oil companies want people to buy their product. Although in the case of oil exploration companies initially the product they are selling is an investment with the potential to have a large pay off down the line. Of course the larger they can hype the market the more people will be interested and more likely to invest. A few might be turned off by deeper reading into the flaky numbers but there are more than enough people out there with wads of cash who are willing to take a gamble. Hence the company attracts investors and the board of directors live sweet for a couple of years on the investment capital until the next big find.
2. Most people don't understand basic mathematics
The second reason why oil companies get away with overblown estimates is because most people don't understand basic mathematics.
Taking the example above the Coober Pedy could hold somewhere between 3.5 billion and 233 billion barrels. Most people don't stop and think about how huge the difference in those numbers actually is. If we converted that to a salary of $3,500 and compared it to $233,000 we see very easily how the former wouldn't last more than a few months while latter would provide a wealth of excess. Another way of thinking about it is that 233 billion is over 6550 percent larger than 3.5 billion.
Scientifically the confidence intervals would be so wide as to be absolutely meaningless. But most people don't get this and so oil companies continue to pedal this hogwash.
3. The bystander effect
It's basic human nature to avoid a problem until it starts affecting you personally. It is also basic human nature to avoid a problem if everyone else is also avoiding the problem. The is called the bystander effect or Genovese syndrome. For example an accident with a crowd standing around: because the majority of bystanders are doing nothing about it, the less likely it is for anyone individual to break the mold and help those involved in the accident. This is occurring because as the number of bystanders increases an individual is less likely to notice the situation, interpret it as a problem and less likely to assume responsibility for taking action.
In the realm of energy activism there are only a small number of people willing to risk their careers and reputations in calling for an end to the status quo. The majority of people don't even notice our addiction to oil let alone see it as a problem. Therefore the oil companies throw around any numbers they like and barely anyone not already interested in energy takes any notice.
4. Keeping business as usual
Given that we live in an age of sound bites and miniscule attention spans what we read in the form of headlines is incredibly powerful. This creates problems when those headlines aren't entirely truthful and we can't even have a frank and open discussion about our energy future because “everything's fine, they keep finding big ones everywhere.”
If we look at the figures above comparing oil company profits to countries GDP's we can see that oil companies are doing pretty darn well for themselves. They don't want anything to change that could threaten their profit margin. They have a vested interest in keeping business as usual.
There is a concerted effort to downplay the occurrence of peak oil and to reinforce that there is plenty of affordable oil left in the world. Because if people really start getting spooked en mass then governments could be forced into seriously looking into alternative energy, the last thing any oil company really wants.
By reporting overblown field estimates oil companies keep people passive and unconcerned about their future. This means oil companies can get on with making as much money as they possibly can while cheap oil is still relatively accessible.
5. Warding off effective action on climate change
There is a wealth of evidence that oil companies have invested huge amounts of money in disinformation campaigns to confuse the public about climate change. By downplaying climate change and continuing to attract investment with overblown field estimates oil companies can continue with the most environmentally damaging industry on earth.
Overblown field estimates keep investors away from alternative energy projects and keep governments away from effective climate change policy as they vie for petro dollars.
In these tough financial times governments are jumping over each other to look attractive towards oil companies. Oil companies promise huge financial benefits for the relaxation of pesky environmental laws and the increase in penalties for protesting against oil companies.
In 2009, what is believed to be the world's largest and rarest piece of cloth made entirely from the silk of the golden silk orb-weaver was exhibited at the American Museum of Natural History in New York. It is said to be the “only large piece of cloth made from natural spider silk existing in the world today.” It is a breathtaking textile and the story of its creation is fascinating.
This piece of cloth was a project led jointly by Simon Peers, a British art historian who specializes in textiles, and Nicholas Godley, his American business partner. The project took five years to complete and cost over £300,000 (approximately $395820). The result of this endeavor was a 3.4-meter (11.2 ft/) by 1.2-meter (3.9 ft.) piece of textile.

The Inspiration for a Spider Web Silk Masterpiece
The cloth produced by Peers and Godley is a gold-colored brocaded shawl/cape. The inspiration for this masterpiece was drawn by Peers from a French account dating to the 19th century. The account describes the attempt of a French Jesuit missionary by the name of Father Paul Camboué to extract and making fabrics from spider silk. Whilst various attempts have been made in the past to turn spider silk into fabric, Father Camboué is regarded as the first person who succeeded in doing so. Nonetheless, spider web had already been harvested in ancient times for different purposes. The ancient Greeks, for instance, used spider web to stop wounds from bleeding.
As a missionary in Madagascar, Father Camboué utilized a species of spiders found on the island to produce his spider web silk. Together with a business partner by the name of M. Nogué, a spider silk fabric industry was established on the island and one of their products, “a complete set of bed hangings” was even exhibited at the Paris Exposition of 1898. The work of the two Frenchmen has since been lost. Nevertheless, it received some attention at that time and provided inspiration for Peers and Godley's undertaking about a century later.
Catching and Extracting the Spider Silk
One of the important things in Camboué and Nogué's production of spider silk is a device invented by the latter to extract the silk. This small machine was hand-driven and was capable of extracting silk from up to 24 spiders simultaneously without hurting them. Peers managed to build a replica of this machine, and the ‘spider-silking' process could begin.
Before this, however, the spiders had to be caught. The spider used by Peers and Godley to produce their cloth is known as the red-legged golden orb-web spider ( Nephila inaurata ), which is a species native to Eastern and South-eastern Africa, as well as several islands in the Western Indian Ocean, including Madagascar. Only the females of this species produce the silk, which they weave into webs. The webs glow in the sunlight and it has been suggested that this is meant either to attract prey, or to serve as a camouflage.

For Peers and Godley, as many as a million of these female red-legged golden orb-web spiders had to be captured in order to acquire enough silk for their shawl / cape. Fortunately, this is a common species of spider and it is abundant on the island. The spiders were returned to the wild once they ran out of silk. After a week, however, the spiders could generate silk once more. The spiders only produce their silk during the rainy season, so they were only caught during the months between October and June.
At the end of four years, a golden-colored shawl / cape was produced. It went on display first at the American Museum of Natural History in New York and then at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London. This piece of work proved that spider silk could indeed be used to make fabrics.
Difficulty in Spider Silk Production
Nevertheless, it is not an easy product to mass produce. When housed together, for example, these spiders tend to turn into cannibals. Still, spider silk has been found to be extremely strong, yet light and flexible, a property that intrigues many scientists. Therefore, researchers have been trying to obtain this silk by other means.
One, for instance, is to insert the spider genes into other organisms (such as bacteria, though some have tried it on cows and goats), and then to harvest the silk from them. Such attempts have only been moderately successful. It seems that for the time being, one would still need to catch a great number of spiders if one wishes to produce a piece of fabric from its silk.

National security adviser H.R. McMaster on Sunday said Russia should question its support for Syrian President Bashar Assad.
"Russia should ask themselves, 'What are we doing here?'" he said on "Fox News Sunday."
"'Why are we supporting this murderous regime that is committing mass murder of its own population and using the most heinous weapons available?'"

McMaster said the renewed focus on Syria is a good opportunity for Russian leadership to re-evaluate what it is doing.
"Russia could be part of the solution," he said, adding that now, much of the world thinks Russia is "part of the problem."
He said the relationship between the U.S. and Russia today will be "whatever the Russians wants it to be."
"Do they want it to be a relationship of competition and potential conflict? I don't see how that's in Russian interests. Or do they want it to be a relationship in which we can find areas of cooperation that are in mutual interests?" McMaster asked.
"How is it in anyone's interest that this conflict in Syria and this catastrophe in the greater Middle East continues, and they can be part of the solution."
Last week, the U.S. launched a missile strike on a Syrian military air base in retaliation for a chemical attack in northern Syria earlier that the U.S. has blamed on the administration of Syrian President Bashar Assad.
@J.C. This might be possible, but I don't think that anyone in the team is willing to spend time on this. We are always open for patches though.
The development on VLC is mostly done by the principle "implement what you personally need". Most of us think that they don't need this, ergo they don't implement it.
Additionally, a media player isn't responsible to extract files automatically. That's the special field of a decompression-application in my opinion. If we were implementing complete rar-support, the next time people would ask us to implement zip-support, etc. pp. so we would end up with a huge app which can decrypt everything, although these features are used by very few people only, because most of our users download VLC to be able to play movies, not to decompress movies.
MMD-0033-2015 - Linux/XorDDoS infection incident report (CNC: HOSTASA.ORG)
Background
This post is an actual malware infection incident of the"Linux/XOR.DDoS" malware (please see previous post as reference-->[LINK]) and malware was in attempt to infect a real Linux server.

Infection method, camouflages and overall summary
I examined further the infection source, what it seems is not what it is at all, what looks like zip archives are ELF malware, and what looks like zips are a shell script malware installers, to be clear, see the illustration below:
Rule number 1 in MMD is : Always check under the hood :)
So the bad actor is making a pair of installers and faked it as zip and downloading the exactly same filename of ELF faked as rar. The reason for faking these archives is simply to avoid the filename blocking from several firewall/IDS filtration. This is just unbelievably irritating, isn't it?
This is the Linux/XorDDOS malware we posted before-->[LINK], the post-infection of this malware made the infected machine to act as bot, remotely controlled for malicious process, config, deny IP, daemon and configurations. They are using XOR'ed encryption communication, processes are sent with md5 encoded beforehand. The main function of this malware ELF is for a stealth DDoS attacker botnet.
The important highlight of this incident and the malware used are:
(1) The usage of US infrastructure used for this malware infection (attacker IP from US host, one IP of panel used for infection, two servers for CNC, with the abuse of .ORG domain registration) with the new scheme worth to be exposed & followed in as incident response and awareness of what this threat does. And all of these just happened about 12h ago..
(2) The usage of multiple hosts in this Linux/XorDDoS, in total: four CNCs. Three of those CNCs are hard coded in hostnames (has domain related) and are receiving the callback from the infected machine, while one of the host is functioned as download server which the infected machine is requesting backdoor to download suspected malicious files.
(3) XOR encryption function is used now to decrypt the drops, reading the configuration file downloaded from the remote hosts (yes, what it downloaded seems to be the config file), and for sending the CNC communication data.
Here is the PoC:
These are the CNC interactive calls trapped in the kernels:
Those calls' DNS requests:
- in tcpdump with the timestamp:
08:21:20.078878 IP mmd.bangs.xorddos.40274 > 8.8.8.8: 27458+ A? aa.hostasa.org. (32)
08:21:20.080602 IP mmd.bangs.xorddos.38988 > 8.8.8.8: 44387+ A? ns4.hostasa.org. (33)

08:21:25.269790 IP mmd.bangs.xorddos.51687 > 8.8.8.8: 22201+ A? ns2.hostasa.org. (33)
Calls to CNC establishment, I pick only one, each callback does this, noted the way it uses Google DNS:
The CNC callback traffic was encrypted, here is the initial callback taken from two separate environments:
Some decrypting for memo:
Here is what coded in the binary for this part:
Downloader...
..yes, the download function is hard coded in binary:
And also the hard evidence in traffic too:)
Interesting facts
These are the malware project source code files used, it is the set of Linux/XOR.DDoS compile set (in C, without "++"), this went straight to my collection libraries for the future reference, thank's to the bad actor and have a nice day to this malware's coder :-))
The malware autorun installer shell script hard coded in the binary, this is so generic..many ELF malware made in China is using this concept:
The one of typical characteristic of malware is the self-copy to /tmp directory on regex '[a-z]{10}'< this can be used to mitigate the initial execution actually:
Spotted the XOR encryption to be run from installer and "supposedly" to be used on decrypting configuration data, in the sample I cracked the key is BB2FA36AAA9541F0
This is the usage of the encryption above during the installation to self copy the malware file, for reversers, see the comment & trail the code:

The Washington Capitals have signed right wing Wayne Simpson to a one-year, two-way contract ($650,000 in the NHL/$140,000 in the AHL), senior vice president and General Manager Brian MacLellan announced today.
Simpson went undrafted after playing four years at Union College (2009-2013). Simpson's EliteProspect file can be accessed here:
Congrats to former Stingray forward Wayne Simpson (@waynetrain2013), who signed his first NHL contract with the @Capitals! #ProudAffiliate pic.twitter.com/GkJesCXg8A — SC Stingrays (@SCStingrays) July 11, 2017
FROM CAPITALS PRESS RELEASE
Simpson, 27, registered 49 points (16g, 33a) in 76 games with the Providence Bruins (AHL) last season, setting AHL career highs in points, goals, assists and games played. The 5'11”, 194-pound right wing led Providence in assists and plus/minus (+22) during the 2016-17 season, ranked second in points and fifth in goals.
In addition, Simpson earned a career-high three assists on Nov. 23 at Rochester and recorded a career-long five-game point streak Nov. 18 to Nov. 25 (3g, 5a). The Boxborough, Mass., native has earned 86 points (25g, 61a) in 148 career AHL games with Providence and Portland. He also recorded 115 points (56g, 59a) in 159 games with Union College (NCAA) from 2009-13 and was named team MVP his senior year (2012-13).
Per the Washington Times, Simpson's signing is most likely for the Capitals' AHL affiliate Hershey Bears, who will need some reinforcements at forward with a few of their players likely headed for the NHL with several openings in the Caps' lineup. However, Simpson may get an opportunity to make the Caps' Opening Night roster, as well. Simpson played for the Capitals' East Coast Hockey League (ECHL) affiliate South Carolina Stingrays during the 2013-14 season, and again in 2014-15, scoring 38 goals while adding 58 assists for 96 points in 191 games played.
Donald Trump Jr. has released what he says are screenshots of the full email chain arranging the meeting between him and a Russian attorney who allegedly had damaging information about Hillary Clinton.
The meeting took place at Trump Tower in New York on June 9, 2016, and was arranged by Rob Goldstone, a music producer and an acquaintance of Trump's.
Trump posted a statement on his verified Twitter account about the situation, as well as four pages of purported emails between him and Goldstone, saying in the statement that he was doing so "in order to be totally transparent."
Here's my statement and the full email chain pic.twitter.com/x050r5n5LQ — Donald Trump Jr. (@DonaldJTrumpJr) July 11, 2017
In the messages, Goldstone describes the lawyer as "The Russian government attorney," and her name is not mentioned.
Here is page 4 (which did not post due to space constraints). pic.twitter.com/z1Xi4nr2gq — Donald Trump Jr. (@DonaldJTrumpJr) July 11, 2017
The exchange appears to have begun on June 3, 2016, when Goldstone reached out to the eldest son of then-candidate Donald Trump Sr. In that email Goldstone appears to refer to one of his clients, Emin Agalarov, a singer from Azerbaijan who is the son of a wealthy businessman, Aras Agalarov.
"Emin just called and asked me to contact you with something very interesting," Goldstone wrote, according to a screenshot.
"The Crown prosecutor of Russia met with his father Aras this morning and in their meeting offered to provide the Trump campaign with some official documents and information that would incriminate Hillary and her dealings with Russia and would be very useful to your father," Goldstone wrote, according to the screenshot.
"This is obviously very high level and sensitive information but is part of Russia and its government's support for Mr. Trump -- helped along by Aras and Emin," Goldstone allegedly continued.
In a subsequent email in the purported chain, Goldstone allegedly wrote that he won't sit in on the meeting but "will send the names of the two people meeting with you for security when I have them later."
The lawyer has been publicly identified as Natalia Veselnitskaya, but the identity of the second person has not been established. Donald Trump Jr. has not referred to a second individual allegedly attending the meeting in any of the multiple statements he has made about it since knowledge of it became public this weekend.
Veselnitskaya spoke to NBC's "Today" this morning and denied that she has connections to the Kremlin or that she was part of any Russian effort to interfere in the 2016 presidential election.
What we know about Donald Trump Jr.'s meeting with a Russian lawyer during the campaign
Trump Jr. meeting with Russian lawyer may have violated campaign laws, say legal experts
Donald Trump Jr. previously confirmed that he invited to the meeting his father's then–campaign adviser and son-in-law, Jared Kushner, and then–campaign chairman, Paul Manafort. Donald Trump Jr. and his father's lawyers said that Donald Trump Sr. was not involved in the meeting, and on Monday, White House deputy press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said that the elder Trump learned about the meeting only "in the last couple of days."
Donald Trump Jr. has released statements on the meeting and agreed to share information about it with the Senate Intelligence Committee.
Along with the alleged emails today, he released an additional statement, which read:
"To everyone, in order to be totally transparent, I am releasing the entire email chain of my emails with Rob Goldstone about the meeting on June 9, 2016. The first email on June 3, 2016 was from Rob, who was relating a request from Emin, a person I knew from the 2013 Miss Universe Pageant near Moscow. Emin and his father have a very highly respected company in Moscow. The information they suggested they had about Hillary Clinton I thought was Political Opposition Research. I first wanted to just have a phone call but when that didn't work out, they said the woman would be in New York and asked if I would meet. I decided to take the meeting. The woman, as she has said publicly, was not a government official. And, as we have said, she had no information to provide and wanted to talk about adoption policy and the Magnitsky Act. To put this in context, this occurred before the current Russian fever was in vogue. As Rob Goldstone said just today in the press, the entire meeting was 'the most inane nonsense I ever heard. And I was actually agitated by it.'"

A man convicted of kidnapping and sexually assaulting two 15-year-old girls about three weeks apart last year in Lancaster repeatedly lashed out Tuesday at a judge who sentenced him to 100 years to life in state prison.
In comments that were interrupted by outbursts from Joseph Kenneth Cornett, Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Henry J. Hall said a “monster” had been stopped and he wanted the two teens to know that “none of this is their fault.”
“It's Mr. Cornett's fault,” Hall said, noting later that the attacks were among the most brutal sex crimes he had seen in 40 years in the criminal justice system and that it was “highly unlikely that Mr. Cornett will ever be released from custody.”
Cornett repeatedly broke in as the judge spoke, saying at one point, “Call me a monster. You're a monster.”
As statements were read from the victims and one of their mothers about the impact of the attacks, Cornett maintained, “I didn't rape anybody … I never kidnapped anybody … I was high on PCP. They got in the car on their own.”
At another point, he told the judge, “Stop talking … Come on with the double-life sentences, man … so I don't have to be around this no more.”
After the judge finished laying out the terms of Cornett's sentence, the defendant interrupted again to tell him that he, the prosecutor and jurors were “going to hell.”
In a statement read in court on her behalf, one of the victims directly addressed the defendant.
“You raped me. You took away my freedom,” she said.
The other victim called Cornett a ‘bad person” and said she will not let the crime “drive me down.”
Cornett's sentencing had repeatedly been delayed, and he was ordered to be forcibly extracted from his jail cell this morning, according to Deputy District Attorney Jon Hatami.
Cornett was brought to court on a stretcher to which he was handcuffed.
He was found guilty March 24 of two counts each of forcible rape, committing a lewd act on a child and kidnapping to commit rape, along with one count each of sexual penetration by a foreign object, assault with intent to commit rape, assault with intent to commit sodomy, assault by force likely to produce great bodily injury, furnishing marijuana to a minor and possession of PCP.
Jurors also convicted him of seven counts of resisting, delaying or obstructing a peace officer.
The prosecutor told jurors that “the defendant is nothing more than a serial rapist” who attacked one of the victims after she's accepting a ride from him on April 13, 2015, and targeted the other teen while she's walking home from school last May 6.
Investigators tied the Lancaster man to the unsolved rape case from April following his arrest in connection with the attack in May.
The victim of the earlier attack had run away from home and ducked into a garage where she encountered Cornett and two other men, Hatami said. Cornett offered to drive the teen home, but instead took her “all the way out into the desert … pulled her into the dirt and he raped her,” the prosecutor said.
The prosecutor told jurors that Cornett then told the girl, “Let's do this again. And this time, let's do it right, with no screaming,” before raping her again.
Hatami acknowledged that the teen smoked marijuana provided to her by Cornett and that she had run away from home, but said “that didn't mean she deserved to be raped.”
The girl who was attacked in May was walking home from school when Cornett stopped his car and told her she could be arrested for jaywalking. Cornett “promised to take her home” but instead drove her to an abandoned trailer, ordered her to get out of the car and assaulted her, according to Hatami.
The girl “pleaded with the defendant to let her go” and then ran out of the trailer without any pants, underwear or shoes when he wasn't looking, the prosecutor said.
The girl sought help from a motorist, who called 911 while others nearby rushed to the scene and some confronted Cornett. The bystanders chased Cornett, who jumped into his car, which ultimately got stuck in a sandy ditch.
When Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies arrived, “he resisted … grabbed one of the deputies … (and) had to be Tased, I believe, three times,” Hatami said.
The prosecution was barred during the trial from introducing any evidence about Cornett's alleged admission that he was HIV-positive. The judge said Cornett “chose to make a false report to the police that he was HIV- positive.”
Outside court, the prosecutor said Cornett will be subject to HIV testing.

It's official, a new halo brand has been created at Ford, and it's called Ford Performance. Think of it as Dearborn's own version of M or AMG.
The new division will be led by chief Mustang engineer Dave Pericak, and it will unify SVT, Team RS, and Ford Racing as a single, cohesive global brand.
Ford's Raj Nair says Ford Performance will have an "agile, skunkworks-type spirit." Earlier in the same press conference, Ford honcho Mark Fields confirmed once and for all that the next-gen Focus RS will indeed be a global vehicle. We're finally getting it.
That car will be part of a 12-vehicle performance onslaught that will roll out through 2020.
Our sources also tell us that the ultra-focused, Z/28-hunting Shelby GT350R, the new F-150 Raptor, and the ultra-secret Ford GT successor are among the Ford Performance product announcements planned for next month's Detroit Auto Show.
Stay tuned.
Pilot mismanagement and confusion caused Asiana Flight 214 to crash in San Francisco last year, US accident investigators concluded Tuesday.
The National Transportation Safety Board said there was confusion over whether one of the airliner's key controls was maintaining speed.
The plane, with 307 people on board, was too low and too slow during the landing attempt. Its tail struck a seawall and was ripped off. The rest of plane went spinning and sliding down the runway. When the shattered plane came to rest, a fire erupted. The crash was the only fatal passenger airline accident in the US in the last five years.
Before the vote, Chris Hart, the NTSB's acting chairman, said that increasingly complex automated aircraft controls designed to improve safety are instead creating new opportunities for error.
The Asiana flight crew "over-relied on automated systems that they did not fully understand", said Chris Hart, the NTSB's acting chairman.
"In their efforts to compensate for the unreliability of human performance, the designers of automated control systems have unwittingly created opportunities for new error types that can be even more serious than those they were seeking to avoid," Hart said.
The five-member board is scheduled vote on the probable cause of the Asiana crash, the only fatal passenger airline accident in the US in the last five years.
Among the other issues raised by the investigation are some that long have concerned aviation officials, including hesitancy by some pilots to abort a landing when things go awry or to challenge a captain's actions.
Three experienced pilots were in the cockpit on 6 July 2013. The plane, a Boeing 777, had one of the industry's best safety records. And weather conditions that sunny day were near perfect.
Despite the violence of the crash, only three people were killed – Chinese teens seated in the back who may not have been wearing their seatbelts and were thrown from the plane. One of the teenage girls survived the crash but was run over by two rescue vehicles in the chaos afterward. Nearly 200 people were injured.

In documents made public by the safety board, Asiana acknowledged the likely cause of the accident was the crew's failure to monitor and maintain the plane's airspeed, and its failure to abort the landing when in trouble. The South Korea-based airline said the pilot and co-pilot reasonably believed the automatic throttle would keep the plane flying fast enough to land safely, when in fact the auto throttle was effectively shut off after the pilot idled it to correct an unexplained climb earlier in the landing.
Asiana said the plane should have been designed so that the auto throttle would maintain the proper speed after the pilot put it in "hold mode".
Boeing had been warned about the problem by US and European aviation regulators. Asiana urged the safety board to recommend that the aircraft maker be required to include an audible warning to alert pilots when the throttle changes to a setting in which it no longer is maintaining speed.
"Asiana has a point," said John Cox, a former airline pilot and aviation safety consultant, "but this is not the first time it has happened. Any of these highly automated airplanes have these conditions that require special training and pilot awareness. … This is something that has been known for many years and trained for many years."
Boeing told the board there was nothing wrong with the plane, and the crash was caused by the failure of the pilots to maintain speed and to abort the landing when the approach had become unstable, as required by their company's policies. An unstable approach occurs when a plane's speed or rate of descent is too fast or to slow, or the plane isn't properly aligned for landing.
Captain Lee Kang Kuk, 45, a veteran pilot who was new to the 777, was flying the plane. Because an airport navigational aid that helps planes land wasn't working that day, Kuk was flying a visual approach that involves lining up the jet for landing by looking through the windshield and using numerous other cues, rather than relying on a radio-based system called a glide-slope that guides aircraft to the runway. A training captain was sitting next to him in the right seat watching his performance.
Kuk told transportation accident investigators that he did not immediately move to abort the landing after it became unstable because he felt only the instructor pilot had that authority. Cockpit culture in which the senior captain is viewed as supreme was identified as a factor in several South Korean airliner crashes in the 1980s and 90s. Afterward, procedures and hierarchies were overhauled in Korea and elsewhere, including the US.

"People are like, 'The rain is coming this winter. When are you going to fix this problem?'" Walsh says. "We're going to try to do our best and that might happen in twenty years..."
"Or sooner," Jue interrupts. "It's not necessarily twenty years, but the easy solutions just aren't available."
In the meantime, residents and business owners are largely on their own in preparing for what could be a wet and stormy winter. DPW provides ten free sandbags per resident every winter, an offer met with derision from residents. "Sandbags are a bandaid on a gushing wound," Blane Bachelor scoffs.
The SFPUC is also encouraging residents to purchase flood insurance and has started a grant program to reimburse property owners for the cost of certain projects — like installing a flood barrier in a doorway or a sewer backflow preventer. Hans Art, the mechanic at 17th and Folsom, says that he worked with the SFPUC for four months to get the grant program up and running, but in the last week, he realized that he won't be able to take advantage of it, thanks to legal fine print that would require him to hold the city harmless and defend the city legally if anyone sues over his project.
According to Walsh, the SFPUC has received nine applications for grants so far, accepted two, and denied one.
"People are getting creative," Walsh says of the projects property owners are resorting to to protect themselves from sewage. She mentions one man who raised the entire sidewalk fronting his property in order to prevent sewage from flowing in from the street.
That man is Chris Hickey, and his property is at 2140 Folsom, around the corner from Art's auto shop. Hickey shows off the raised sidewalk, as well as the specially sealed garage doors he's put into the property since he bought it three years ago. After Hickey raised the sidewalk, he says, the city wanted to charge him $2,000 a year to inspect the encroachment — a charge he had to go to the Planning Department to get waived.
"You try to fix the problem to protect yourself, and then they come after you," he says.
Hickey isn't feeling particularly charitable toward the city of San Francisco today. He just received a letter in the mail, informing him that he's responsible for replacing one of the trees that line his portion of the block. What happened to the tree?, I ask.
"It washed away in the flood."
Californians are used to living on the edge. This is a state where people dig foundations on active fault lines; where homes perch on oceanside cliff tops; where wildfires sweep through the state on a yearly basis; where an earthquake-vulnerable liquefaction zone susceptible to sea level rise is deemed an appropriate place to build hospitals, condominium towers, and a professional basketball arena. We watch movies about the disasters we anticipate, and then head home to the communities we've built in defiance of the disasters we know will one day transpire.
We build anyway. We take the risk.
When you talk to the SFPUC about the flooding at Cayuga or 17th and Folsom, they treat it like any other risk of natural disaster. The homeowners, they say, have to be responsible for their properties — which are at risk of flood. "No one can say to anyone's face that we can design a sewer system that will handle every single storm of every single intensity from now into the future," says Tyrone Jue.
"The city can't be responsible for every flood," he adds. "Anything that we're going to do from this point forward has to be considered a partnership. You can't just assume someone else will take care of it for you. No, that's not how anything else works."
This might make sense if the flooding that residents at Cayuga and 17th and Folsom are experiencing was in fact a completely natural disaster. If those property owners had chosen to build at the equivalent of a quickly eroding oceanfront cliff, few would expect the government to swoop in and buttress their foundations.
But the homes and businesses on 17th and Folsom and Cayuga aren't on the edge of a cliff. Instead, they're in the middle of a convergence of decades of decisions made by municipal engineers, city planners, and politicians.
Gravity might make water flow from Glen Park to Cayuga Avenue, but gravity isn't responsible for that water including an unholy mix of feces, bathwater, urine, restaurant grease, used condoms, and toilet paper. Every single person who flushes a toilet and expects not to have to deal with it later — every single one of us — is responsible for that.
Standing outside of her home of 50 years with her son Michael, Victoria Sanchez says she has little hope that the city will actually fix the problem. She can't even get a city worker to come out and clear the catch basins of leaves, she says, let alone fix the entire sewer system.
And with winter coming, she is fearful for what El Niño will bring.
"They say, oh, it's an act of God," Mrs. Sanchez says. "No. It's the plumbing. It has nothing to do with God."
Basically Mother Teresa over here.
Pharmaceutical gazillionaire Dennis M. Jones “was struck by an intriguing coincidence” upon upgrading his 151-foot yacht to a 164-foot, custom-built yacht named the D'Natalin IV, the Times reports. That coincidence? That the D'Natalin IV's $34 million price tag was roughly equivalent to the $34 million he'd given to charity since 2000.
Which got him thinking: $34 million on curing disease and helping the homeless, $34 million on “high gloss raised panel walnut cabinetry and inlay stone floors” for a floating mansion. What's the difference, really?
No, really, that's the thought process that went through Jones's mind, according to the Times.
Could the purchase of a superyacht be more than an act of self-indulgence? Could it provide something as significant, Mr. Jones wondered, as the financial aid he has given to children, homeless people, drug addicts and groups that promote education and entrepreneurship?
The answer to all of those questions, of course, is “hell no, are you crazy?” (In fact, studies have shown the exact opposite — that high-end luxuries like yachts and sports cars actually perpetuate inequality.) But that didn't stop Jones from rationalizing his Scrooge McDuck lifestyle as an act of charity. He even called in the CEO of Christensen Yachts, which built the boat, to testify about how truly meaningful his order had been to the once-struggling company.
“It costs $170,000 a month in crew, insurance, moorage, fuel and the crew buying all their things for the boat,” said the CEO. “It's a constant cash flow machine for the local economy whenever one of those things pulls in.” A friend of Jones's added, “I'd call it ‘fire hose economics' because the money left his account that fast.” And Jones himself chimed in with some self-congratulations: “The [yacht-maker] is up and running better because of us.”
“Mr. Jones said he wanted to encourage other wealthy people to think about how their opulent lifestyles could provide jobs just as their charity helps people in need,” the Times said.
Truly, Jones should be cheered for his selfless act of buying a big-ass boat. Perhaps a Nobel Peace Prize is in order for Kim and Kanye's wedding, too?

In Syria's ancient city of Palmyra, the Islamic State is finishing a job that four years of violent conflict got started.
The Islamic State has become infamous for destroying historical artifacts in land it controls, from the Mosul Museum in northern Iraq to the ancient Assyrian city of Nimrud. When Islamic State militants overran Syria's ancient city of Palmyra in May, it seemed that another of the world's great cultural treasures would be lost.
On Sunday, those fears were confirmed when observers reported that the Islamic State had used explosives to blow up part of the 2,000-year-old Temple of Baalshamin, one of the most important sites in Palmyra. The news came just days after the Islamic State executed Khalid al-Asaad, 83, who had served as Palmyra's chief of antiquities for a half-century.
But there's one thing many reports neglect to mention about Palmyra: The four-year-long Syrian conflict has been quietly destroying it since even before the Islamic State, also known as ISIL or ISIS, came on the scene.
In April 2013, Reuters reported that Palmyara's ruins were being damaged in fighting between rebels and forces loyal to Syrian President Bashar Assad. According to witnesses, rebels were moving in and around the archeological sites and Assad's army fired at them with rockets, mortars and artillery shells. The Syrian Ministry of Culture's director of antiquities and museums also admitted to Reuters that “the Syrian army is in some areas in the archeological site and we oppose this.”
UNESCO, too, has been warning about damage to Palmyra, a world heritage site, for two years or more. The ancient city, which the United Nations' cultural organization calls an “oasis in the Syrian desert” that contains the “monumental ruins of a great city that was one of the most important cultural centers of the ancient world,” has been officially listed as “in danger” since 2013.
In a January 2014 world heritage progress report to UNESCO, the Syrian Ministry of Culture detailed the effects of conflict in and around the site, which included, according to UNESCO's summary:
Holes from shells and bullets in the southern and eastern walls of the temple, and in the wall of the wood warehouse adjacent to the guesthouse;
The collapse of two columns of the southern portico of the temple;
Bullet and shelling traces on the southern, western and northern walls of the temple, and the column in the north-eastern corner of the portico of the fence of the temple;
Traces of burning on the southern and eastern walls, on the lintel of the eastern portico, and the southern window.
And that's according to the Syrian government itself. UNESCO hasn't been able to visit the site since March 2011. But based on other sources, including satellite imagery, UNESCO says the government continued to use the site as a base of military operations until it was captured by the Islamic State in May.
It wasn't just shelling and military vehicles doing damage. The conflict has created ideal conditions for looting artifacts and made it impossible to do the kind of regular maintenance that ancient sites like Palmyra need.
In a video statement released in May, UNESCO Director-General Irina Bokova said she was “extremely worried” about the developments in Palmyra, referring to the pillaging of Mosul and Nimrud. But she also noted that she'd previously requested that the Syrian military cease operations there. “Unfortunately, we have seen this last two years some damages made. Palmyra was converted into a military camp. We have seen columns fallen and damage also to the palm groves that are adjacent to the area.”
There's no denying that Islamic State militants take particular delight in destroying cultural symbols, but remember: As the Islamic State levels parts of Palmyra and erases another piece of human history, they're just finishing what Assad, other rebel groups, and four years of conflict have started.

With Amazon Web Service's (AWS) cloud infrastructure and customer base dwarfing its competitors, does AWS have greater leeway to reduce prices than rivals in the long run?
Google's VP of engineering talks economies of scale in the cloud Ben Treynor Sloss discusses how the scale of public cloud platforms impacts the cost of infrastructure.
Google and Amazon Web Services have been fighting price wars for years, driving down the cost of spinning up servers in their cloud platforms in an attempt to be the cheapest game in town.
That wrangling continues: this month Amazon Web Services (AWS) announced its 62nd price cut, while earlier this year Google lowered the cost of reserving cloud infrastructure upfront by introducing Committed Use Discounts (CUD).
In reality, the options for configuring and paying for cloud infrastructure vary so greatly that what typically determines which platform, AWS or Google Cloud Platform (GCP), will be the most cost-effective is how that platform will be used. However, recent analyses commonly cite GCP as the slightly cheaper option for compute and storage.

But with the size of Amazon Web Service's (AWS) cloud infrastructure and customer base dwarfing its competitors, does AWS have greater leeway to reduce prices than rivals in the long run, courtesy of economies of scale?
Not to any meaningful extent according to Ben Treynor Sloss, Google's VP of engineering.
"It's fair to say that all of the major cloud providers are into the scale-level where economies of scale, the returns you get, are de minimis," he said.
"For example, what I've read about Amazon's deployment model, where they'll basically plonk down three buildings that are about one kilometer away from each other. There are no economies of scale left at that point."
John Dinsdale, chief analyst and managing director for Synergy Research Group, said datacenters architects at AWS share the view that "beyond a certain size, the economies of scale that can be achieved in an individual data center drop off rapidly".
However, Amazon's position as the biggest and fastest growing cloud infrastructure provider presents AWS with other opportunities to drive down prices, according to some analyses of the cloud market.
One overview estimated that the price at which Amazon sells cloud infrastructure is higher in order to limit demand to a level where it can be satisfied. Therefore as Amazon expands its infrastructure, so it is able to lower these prices, potentially giving Amazon another advantage in the ongoing price war.
While there aren't meaningful differences in the economies of scale between the major cloud operators, according to Sloss, the price at which cloud providers can offer cloud infrastructure is generally lower than the cost of firms running them in-house, he said.
"That's where it becomes an interesting value proposition," he said, reinforcing the notion that as the price of public cloud infrastructure continues to fall, building private or hybrid clouds will become hard to justify on cost grounds.

Hey kids, want to spend the summer with five of your friends in your very own backyard pool? Then stay the hell away from Banzai's Wild Waves Water Park! David Ng juxtaposed Banzai's box art with a picture of his disappointed kids standing next to the fully assembled “water park.” He wasn't the only one deceived, according to the reviews on Amazon…
Here are several representative snippets:
“I have two preschoolers (ages 2 and 4) and this pool is just the right size for them.” “It is the worst product I'd ever bought from Toys R US and I'll never go to Six Flags! Don't buy it.” “One person can't slide down the slide while one person is in the pool let alone have 2 people sitting in it! The slide is so small and when you turn on the hose to let the sprinklers come down the orange top collapses and has no use!” “As every one else has said this pool is tiny maybe good for 1 or 2 toddlers. Picture on the front is NOT accurate. A 6 year old can't go down the slide with his legs out because they hit the wall. My 3 year old hardly fit. Buy a sprinkler for $5.00 my kids had more fun with that.”
The box admonishes buyers “product may not be as appears on image;” a gross understatement for a gross distortion.

Boy serves as honorary captain for Wichita Thunder game Copyright by KSNW - All rights reserved Video
WICHITA, Kan. (KSNW) - Six-year-old Eagan Sutton was the Wichita Thunder's honorary captain Friday night.
Eagan was born eight weeks prematurely because he was found to have a heart rate in the 40's. On the third day he was alive, he received his first pacemaker as well as his first open-heart surgery.
Now Eagan is in first grade, and he is an avid hockey fan.
"I am the honorary captain today. I get the drop the puck and sit in the penalty box," said Eagan Sutton, Thunder's honorary captain.
Eagan has had to battle more surgeries., but that isn't keeping him down.
"Since then, he's had two other heart surgeries. One for a replacement pacemaker and one because he's just crazy active and actually broke one of the wires. He is a happy, energetic, crazy kid. He takes ballet, jazz and tap along with a class that kind of combines acrobatics and dance at the same time," said Megan Sutton, Eagan's mother.
"When something like that happens, and you're not certain if your child is going to make it, there is no feeling that can adequately describe that," said Tyson Sutton, Eagan's father.
Since Ager Hasan was charged with the second degree murder of Kitchener's Melinda Vasilije, Waterloo investigators have been in contact with him.
Hasan fled to the U.S. on April 28, but police do not know his exact location.
"We are now at a standstill," said Waterloo Regional Police Service Insp. Mike Haffner on May 18. "We are still asking for anyone's assistance in finding out where he is."
While on the phone with the Kitchener Post, Haffner was in a meeting with inspectors, going over how they'll push out the story to U.S. media to encourage the public to keep an eye out for the 24-year-old Hamilton resident. He was last seen in Pennsylvania in a parking lot, swapping out a licence plate on to his 2016 black Honda HR-V.
Police found Vasilije, 22, dead in her home on Country Hill Drive in the early hours of April 28. She was stabbed to death.
Hasan, who'd been in a year-long relationship with Vasilije, allegedly fled the scene, which was described in a Reddit post claiming to be written by Hasan and describing the details of her murder.
“Out of shock and fear I grab one (a knife),” said the post, adding he did so after Vasilije tried to stab him. “I hit her with it, almost blindly. A few times. I didn't know what happened. I was confused, shocked and scared. I had no intentions of that happening. When I left I honestly thought she just passed out. Then I looked at the blood, and started freaking out and just ran.”
Hasan was previously known to police and had been charged with break and entering Vasilije's apartment and two counts of assault. Vasilije was not the victim of those alleged assaults, but the court ordered Hasan to stay out of Waterloo Region and to not have contact with her.
Clive Owen will present the show in Italy
The whole first season of Steven Soderbergh's acclaimed period drama The Knick will screen at the Rome Film Festival on Oct. 17 and 18. The Oscar-winning director returned from his “retirement” to direct the vehicle for Cinemax. The show has become the centerpiece for the network's rebranding strategy, to focus on high-quality original series.
Clive Owen will meet with audiences in Rome to present the 10-episode series, which has already been picked up for a second season.
The Knick, short for Knickerbocker Hospital, stars Owen as Doctor John Thackery, a well-respected surgeon who is constantly evolving the field of medicine in early 20th century New York at the expense of many a life. The series tackles tough issues like drug addiction, classism, racism and sexism and doesn't shy away from blood and guts. The multi-episode payoff makes the film festival a fine venue to air the drama.

The Hollywood Reporter hailed the series as “a bold, stylishly directed period medical drama powered by the winning duo of director Steven Soderbergh and star Clive Owen.” The drama premiered in the U.S. on Aug. 8 this past summer.
Rome Film Festival artistic director Marco Mueller commends TV as a medium for filmmakers to explore longer narratives. “And while films at the movies continue to be novellas, or serially-produced comic books, quality television is now capable of both fostering and producing a sort of film narrative that breaks conventional formats, and can sometimes be as long and eloquent as a novel,” he says. “There can no longer be any doubt therefore that the great contemporary film-novel is now brought to us on television. And that the most important contemporary film-novel of the year is called The Knick.”

Russia's central bank has raised its key interest rate by one percentage point to 10.5% as it steps up the fight to tackle inflation.
It comes just six weeks after it raised the rate to 9.5% from 8%.
The bank's official website added that it would continue raising the rate "in case of further aggravation of inflation risks".
In its monthly economic update the Bank of Russia also said that, as of 8 December, annual inflation was 9.4%.
A weak rouble and a ban on western food imports has kept inflation high.
'Brink'
"The hope is that [interest rate rises] will cut consumption and stop prices rising so fast," said the BBC's Moscow correspondent Steven Rosenberg."
But there's a downside to that; raising interest rates slows economic growth - and that's not good, with Russia on the brink of recession.
"As for the rouble, it has continued to slide and has fallen to a new low against the dollar."
The rouble hit new lows after the rates decision, and was trading at 55.45 against the dollar and 68.98 against the euro not long after the bank's announcement.
The rate hike comes a day after the bank admitted it had intervened to support the rouble in foreign currency markets last week, spending a total of $4.53bn (£2.9bn).
It has spent more than $70bn supporting the rouble since the start of the year.
The Bank of Russia also said on Thursday that GDP growth would be weak during 2015-16, as consumer activity weakened.
Analysis: Andrew Walker, BBC economics correspondent
There were no easy options for the Russian central bank. Rising inflation and weakening economic activity call for opposite moves in interest rates.
The bank chose to focus on the inflation problem and used the standard response from the central bankers' toolkit.
The sharpness of the dilemma has a lot to do with sanctions. The west's economic response to the conflict in Ukraine has aggravated both inflation and the economic weakness.
The impact on inflation is through the value of the Russian currency. It has been undermined by nervous Russians and others getting their money out due to fear of the impact of sanctions. The precipitous fall in the Rouble's value in turn pushes up the price of imported goods.
If the west wanted evidence that sanctions are making a difference, it's plain to see in the conflicting pressures facing Russia's central bank.
Indian deal
The World Bank has previously warned that the Russian economy will shrink by at least 0.7% in 2015 if oil prices do not recover.
The drop in the price of oil has also hurt the Russian economy.
The World Bank's estimate is based on a scenario of crude prices averaging at $78 in 2015.
But if oil prices fell to $70 on average, Russia's output would shrink by 1.5%, it said.
In late morning trade, North Sea Brent crude rose 63 cents to $64.87, up from Wednesday's low of $63.56 - the weakest in five years. Meanwhile, US crude, which also hit a five-year low on Wednesday, rose 48 cents to $61.42.
Also on Thursday, Russia's top crude oil producer Rosneft said it had reached a preliminary agreement to supply India's Essar Group with 10 million tonnes of oil over a 10-year period.
Sebastian Vollmer struggled late in the season, allowing 5½ sacks in the final seven games, including playoffs.
INDIANAPOLIS — Two Patriots offensive linemen underwent surgical procedures recently. According to league sources, Sebastian Vollmer had his right knee scoped on Wednesday and Dan Connolly had a procedure on his right shoulder last week.
Vollmer's surgery was termed postseason maintenance, but the knee — not his back — is the reason he struggled during the final weeks of the season. He had a procedure on his back last offseason.
Before missing the Patriots' Thanksgiving night game against the Jets, Vollmer had allowed just one sack and 14 pressures. But in the final seven games, including the playoffs, he allowed 5½ sacks and 23 pressures.

The surgery is considered minor, especially for an offensive lineman, and will not affect negotiations between the free-agent-to-be and the Patriots (or another team).

The Patriots could use the franchise tag to retain Vollmer, but that is considered unlikely, according to league sources.
Connolly, 30, is expected to be ready for training camp. Signed to a three-year contract before last season, presumably to be the starting center, the Patriots had to bump Connolly to right guard when Brian Waters opted not to rejoin the team. When the shuffling was over, Ryan Wendell became the starting center.
Connolly started 14 regular-season games at right guard, missing the Arizona game because of a concussion suffered in Week 1. He also missed the game against the Colts with a back injury.
He was listed as limited in practice on the team report for the rest of the regular season because of his back.

There is one rather tall tight end wandering around Indianapolis this week who bears a striking resemblance to former Patriots tight end Christian Fauria.
It is UCLA product Joseph Fauria, the nephew of Christian, who played with the Patriots from 2002-05.
Even though Joseph was only 5 when his uncle was drafted in the second round by the Seahawks in 1995, he said this week that seeing that event made him want to follow in his uncle's footsteps.
Fortunately for the youngster, he grew to 6 feet 7 inches, 259 pounds, and tall, pass-catching tight ends with basketball backgrounds are all the rage in the NFL.
Of his 46 receptions in 14 games for the Bruins last fall, 12 went for touchdowns. That is where he differs from his uncle.

“The tight end position has changed tremendously since he played, and we're different players,'' the 23-year-old Fauria said. “I can be called more of a receiving tight end, compared to him being more of a blocking style.
“There are some similarities: our drive and our passion for the game; we share the same blood.”
Though the position has changed, some things in the NFL haven't, and Fauria said his uncle, who played 13 years in the league, has been advising him every step of the way.
“He's helped tremendously throughout this process, he helped me with picking an agent, with advice, what I need to work on, what I need to look out for, and just getting me prepared for you guys [in the media] and all that stuff,” he said.
One of the things Christian told Joseph that has stuck with him is “to stay grounded, know where I come from.”
Carpet pulled out
Tight end Rob Gronkowski was slated to work the Oscars red carpet for NFL Network on Sunday, but news came on Friday that the Ravens' Ed Reed was now getting the gig. It is believed the Patriots influenced Gronkowski's decision to pull out of the appearance . . . Cross Myron Pryor and Jake Ballard off the list of players in contract discussions. Because both spent the entire season on the physically unable to perform list, by rule their contracts will toll to 2013 and they'll remain with the Patriots. Pryor was slated to become a free agent this year, while Ballard was an exclusive-rights free agent.
For over a billion years, Mars was possibly the equal of Earth when it came to its geology, its terrain, its conditions, and possibly even for the presence of life. Now that we know the surface contains liquid water even today, it's tempting to look at a whole diversity of features on the Martian surface and ask what caused them.
Much like the surface of the Moon, Mars is littered with massive craters. While the Solar System constantly bombards all the worlds within it with asteroids, comets and other impactors, worlds like Earth are relatively crater-free, due to the fact that our surface is constantly being recycled due to plate tectonics, subduction and volcanic episodes. In fact, Jupiter's closest moon, Io, is such an extreme example of this that there are no craters on its surface at any given time! But Mars definitely has craters, as the winds of the thin atmosphere are sufficient for creating dunes, but not for evening out these cosmic divots carved by the rest of the Universe.
Mars is also Earth-like in that it exhibits signs of volcanic activity, including the largest volcano in the Solar System: Olympus Mons (above). With a molten core like Earth's, we know that volcanism and lava flows is something that's certainly a part of Mars' past history, just as flowing water once was.
These spherules -- also known as Martian blueberries -- were discovered by rovers on Mars, often in the lowland regions. Objects just like this form on Earth, but only at the bottom of bodies of water. Combine this with the fact that we see clear evidence of dried up riverbeds, sedimentary rocks and frozen lakes, subsurface ice and other such features, and we know that Mars had a watery past.
So the evidence for a past history of water is overwhelming, but it's often difficult to look at any one individual feature and simply identify, visually, what its cause was.
Take a look at that gully, above. Was that carved by a river? A glacier? Or was it a lava flow?
Below is an even trickier feature.
Are these streams tricking into a large river? Or is this a lava ridge -- similar to the mid-Atlantic ridge on Earth -- where lava has trickled down the sides?
From this visual inspection, it's impossible to tell. But we have a trick up our sleeves thanks to orbital surveyors: we can measure the topography of these features, or the relative elevation of each point in this image. A lava flow would have the highest point (in altitude) be located at the peak of the flow, and everything else would have to be "downhill" from there, culminating in the "tendrils" at the lowest elevations. But if this were caused by water, the ends of the tendrils would be at the highest points, flowing down into the river basin below.
For both of the classes of features above, the answer is water, not lava! In fact, there's only one class of feature that doesn't look like it was formed by water, exclusively.
There's a class of features known as Floor-Fractured Craters, and they appear to have a variety of contributing factors to what causes them, some of which are water-based and some of which are lava-based. All of these features originated hundreds of millions (or even billions) of years ago on Mars, and persist until the present day.
But make no mistake about it, when you see a gully, a series of "tendril-like" features, or what appears to be a dried-up riverbed or a tubular flow, it was almost certainly carved by water on Mars, not by lava or any other feature, and the topographic data is how we know for sure!
Josh Linkner is confident in Detroit's future. (Diane Weiss/AP)
I spoke with Josh Linkner, author of “The Road to Reinvention,” about Detroit, innovation, disruption, America's future and more. Here's some of our conversation from last week:
You're based in Detroit, a city with its fair share of issues and challenges. What do you see in its future?
JL: I'm hugely optimistic about Detroit's future. It's not just blind optimism I see it playing out in real time. Being here in Detroit and investing in tech start-ups, I have a front-row seat to our city's transformation. While we still have a long way to go, this is poised to be the greatest turnaround story in American history. There is incredible momentum that I think the world needs to see. Every day I'm down here there's a new restaurant that opens, a new art gallery. I look out my window at this beautiful park and people hanging out in the park having lunch and joggers going by.
What's happened in the past, or previous notions of what Detroit is, are just totally different. You don't see tires burning in the streets here. You see a city that was once one of the great cities in our country that had suffered for many years, and it's finally getting back its energy. That's happening from a lot of different perspectives. You got government that was once corrupt is finally being led by thoughtful and mature and business-minded leaders. You've got a federal government that is being supportive financially. You got a huge amount of private industry that is investing billions of dollars in the city.
And you have the philanthropic community that is investing as well. In the same way as we had the perfect storm that really brought us down, you might say now we're in the midst of a perfect sunny day where the factors are aligned and our city is really racing back. We have a good way to go, but the upward trajectory is thrilling.
What industries and sectors will lead this revival?
Linkner's second book was published this summer. (Jossey-Bass)
JL: I think the good news is it's finally a mix. Hindsight is always 20-20. But when you look back at what hurt our city, one of the biggest things is we've never had any economic diversity. We've always been a one-industry town that rose and fell based on the auto markets. Coming back, it's going to be a little different. First of all, I think the automotive sector is really doing well, which is great. So our city's core industry is going to play an important role, certainly. But it's not the only thing anymore.
I'll give you an example. In our case, we run a venture capital firm called Detroit Venture Partners. And we are investing in tech start-ups. When we came to Detroit in 2010, we were the second venture fund, only second by a couple months to General Motors, which has a small venture effort. Today there's nearly 20 venture funds in this city. Furthermore, we took over a building that had been vacant for a couple decades. Brought it back to life and made it kind of ground zero of entrepreneurship in Detroit. It's called the Madison building. This has created so much momentum, both for the companies we've funded and those that want to be close by. It's spilled over, and this square block right now is referred to as the Madison block, and there are 70 tech start-ups within this one square block and growing by the day.
Entrepreneurs, tech entrepreneurs are playing a role. And there's some very cool industries that are happening. Quicken Loans is financial services; they have 10,000 people down here that didn't use to be. There are advances in advanced manufacturing, alternative energy, even medical devices. I think the good news about Detroit's comeback is it isn't only reliant on one industry. It's more of a patchwork that's going to bring us back and keep us there.
Do you think regulations on new technologies such as drones should be lightened to stimulate innovation in Detroit?
JL: We need to make this an entrepreneurial-friendly environment, a business-friendly environment. And let more people take really interesting risks and try new things — whether that's drones or orbit farming or a number of other things that have been tossed out. I will say, though, that I don't think we need a totally off-the-wall silver bullet. It's not like, “Oh gee, Detroit's about to crumble. Let's just try one last thing.” We don't need a Hail Mary pass. I don't think our entire future is reliant on any one far-out idea. Like any great city like Silicon Valley, there's experimentation into strange things, and there's lots of stuff that's happening underneath to support it.
Who do you think are the most innovative companies out there right now?
JL: Whirlpool, one I talk about in the book. There's a big company, and they could have certainly rested on their laurels, but they forged ahead into new areas. They launched something, for example, called Gladiator GarageWorks, the first and now the leader in garage organization systems.
Without that as their core business of making white appliances, they saw a better need to serve their customers, which are homeowners. That division is now a $700 million division. To me, it's about organizations that embrace the reinvention ethos. They view reinvention as an important and ongoing part of their leadership responsibilities. The best of the best reinvent early and often. They view reinvention as sort of constant process rather than a once-a-decade type endeavor.
Are there industries you see as most vulnerable to disruption right now?
JL: Nearly every industry is in the midst of massive upheaval. I think there's so many. One for me is the publishing world; there's a lot of change happening there. You go right down the board and almost every industry is being shaken up. The world is changing at a rate like no other in history. Success is often erroneously viewed as a permanent condition. Like you've arrived. We're successful now. That's really not what happens.
Success is a temporary theme in the context of many external factors. If you had a great movie studio, that's great. You just launched a great hit, but all the external factors that made that hit successful in addition to the great work in that studio. The point is if you keep running the same game plan, it's a sure-fire path to crashing and burning, and so what I think industries and companies need to do frequently is, okay, that worked yesterday, but what's the best strategy for now? How do we engineer the next chapter of our journey rather than just cling to the previous one. It's funny how so many organizations, especially larger ones, get caught up and they think their job is to protect rather than invent. That creates the opportunity for entrepreneurs or competitors to come on and eat their lunch.
Is the mind-set and personality of disrupting an innate trait?
JL: The research shows that creativity, which is really the fundamental DNA of this whole process, is fundamentally a largely learned behavior. It turns out that creativity is 85 percent learned, which is amazing because it turns out as much as 98 percent of adults, you ask them, “Are you a creative person?” They say, “No.” It's largely because they've been socialized out of it.
Maybe a teacher in elementary school said you're not good at art, you're not a creative person. Or they've been so worried about following rules and not making mistakes that they consider themselves uncreative. Or they credit their job to a level of creativity. “Well, I'm a financial planner, so I can't be creative.” All that is totally false. We as human beings have enormous amounts of creative capacities to build those skills up a little bit. Furthermore, organizational structures tend to kill it. If you have a company that is fear-based and that ideas are shot down, and people are yelled at or made to feel foolish, you're never going to get any creativity.
The good news is people have the raw DNA; it's not only one out of 1,000 are born creative. It's leaders' responsibility to nurture and build and expand on that creativity. That will be again the building blocks of successful reinventions.
There's been a stir regarding Jill Lepore's New Yorker article on Clay Christensen and his theory of disruption. What's your reaction to the article?
JL: I think the article was really poorly written. I think it was one of those things like, let's attack a theory to get a bunch of media attention. I think her counterarguments didn't really hold weight. If you zoom out, every great company originally came from some disruptive act, the status quo or an industry, a service. Henry Ford is the classic example here in our backyard of someone who is a disruptor.
When there are massive shifts they often come from small companies who are not bound by tradition. For example, Red Bull wasn't a Coca-Cola product; it was entrepreneurs that changed the industry. Or Zip-Car didn't come from Hertz, it came from an entrepreneur. So I really support Clay Christensen's thinking, and his research has been very sound. This article I thought was more of an attention grab than a logical argument.
Furthermore, because we're talking about it, I'm kind of [annoyed] because she quoted me in the article and clearly hadn't read my book and reached erroneous conclusions and really twisted my words. Ordinarily I don't mind criticism; that's natural. But she'd quote me and then interpret that quote in a way that had no basis of interpretation. It'd be like if I just said, “Hey because you said X, Y and Z, clearly that means that you think that all babies should be murdered.” And the answer is no, that isn't any way, shape or form what you were saying. So I was frustrated that she twisted my words and reached conclusions that were in no way, shape or form my thinking. Had she read my book she would have got it.
If readers should take one lesson from your book, what would that be?
JL: I think the importance of reinvention on a regular basis, whether it's in our careers, our communities or in the broader sense or even our companies. So I think to the extent things are changing so rapidly it's a comment on all of us to be using a blank canvas. It's never really too late. Certainly it's relative to come back from adversity. Look at Detroit. One hundred years ago we were the Silicon Valley of our country.
This is where people would come, and we reinvented ourselves from a fur-trading industry to lumber and then of course manufacturing. When we stopped reinventing is when we stopped winning. Our city became so focused on a sense of entitlement and being untouchable. But today we're fighting back. If Detroit can reinvent itself, falling as hard as it did, to me the lesson for all of us is even if we have suffered some adversity in our lives, it's never too late to reinvent.
There's some hand-wringing over America's future. Do you expect the United States to remain the global leader in innovation?
JL: I'm cautiously optimistic. I think we have some real issues. Clearly there are some real issues. I've always said education. Specifically, I write a lot about creativity, the idea that we're teaching kids to be more rule followers than creative problem solvers. So I'm concerned in that respect, and I think that is what really has led us to our global lead from an economic standpoint and has the biggest threat of undermining us if we go in the wrong direction.
However, I do think — maybe I'm just idealistic — that I have a broad sense of optimism that we as a nation have a strong sense of ingenuity and resourcefulness and determination and willpower. So I think it's more based on my opinion than deep fact, but I don't look out and think, “Oh gosh, the sky is falling.” We're living in a time of incredible opportunity. For example, entrepreneurship is more accessible than it's ever been in our country's history.

http://www.lolcounter.com is a legitimate website used for finding counters to a champion.
lolcounterS.com (with an 'S') is a copy and paste of lolcounter.com text. On loading, it asks you to run a JAVA applet.

Don't run it, obviously.
It also tells you that your Flash is out of date/missing, and AUTOMATICALLY starts downloading a fake flash installer, at least it did on my Chrome, YMMV (legitimate file name copied from the real Flash installer so as to avoid suspicion, but it's more malware). Don't install it, obviously.

Notice & Staydown In Action: HBO Didn't Even Need To Send Takedown Over Autistic Teen's Artwork
from the bursting-your-bubble dept
Things just got a little more weird in the case of the 13 year old British girl who had some art she created taken down from Redbubble's site because the artwork included the phrase "winter is coming." The girl's father responded to the takedown, questioning why HBO, owners of the trademark rights to the phrase in conjunction with the Game of Thrones franchise, would do this to an autistic teenager that wasn't even selling the art, only sharing it. As noted in our original post, the letter Redbubble sent the girl is a mess, lacking any firm reference to trademark or copyright and replacing it only with "IP/Publicity Rights." In addition, the whole letter is written like a forwarded DMCA notice, including offering the ability to counternotice through Redbubble's DMCA counternotice email address... but this would be a trademark issue, to which the DMCA doesn't apply. Lots of people, including the girl's father, assumed this takedown had been carried out at the request of HBO.
It looks like that wasn't the case. What the girl's father missed -- along with many of those reporting on the issue, including myself -- is that Redbubble's letter states that they did this because of HBO's history of issuing DMCA notices, not because it had actually done so in this case.
"We have removed the following content from Redbubble in response to past complaints from Home Box Office, Inc., the claimed owner or licensee of related intellectual property and in accordance with Redbubble's IP/Publicity Rights Policy," it said.
So this wasn't "notice and takedown", it was "notice and staydown", where Redbubble policed HBO intellectual property on its site based on previous complaints. That's not required by law, of course, but it certainly is what many in Hollywood want to see as the standard. And this is a perfect case for why it's a terrible, terrible idea. Legitimate, non-infringing uses get caught up in the blanket takedowns issued by service providers that don't really have a clue as to what they're doing.
And in light of what actually happened, Redbubble's letter, and the way it appears to be disguised as a DMCA notice, is at best horrifically sloppy and at worst an attempt to shift the blame for its voluntary and proactive takedown of a teenage girl's artwork. For it's part, HBO doesn't seem to be happy about this.
"We love when fans are creative in their support of our programmes," the network said in a statement (via Entertainment Weekly). "These works live online in many incarnations, and in the past we have celebrated them by drawing attention to them. "Many for-profit websites that sell products, such as Redbubble, take steps to avoid infringements as part of their standard operating procedure. To suggest a particular individual was targeted, or that HBO threatened legal action against her, is simply untrue."
Now, HBO's history of how it treats fans of Game of Thrones isn't universally positive, and it's worth noting again that the stated reason Redbubble did all of this is because of the network's heavy-handed history when it comes to matters just like this...but I have to think HBO is also pissed off at the way Redbubble's communication with the girl's father allowed him -- and the media -- to conclude this was all HBO's fault for issuing a DMCA takedown.
Regardless, good to know that Redbubble wants to be in the business of proactively policing its site in such a way that it results in the non-infringing artwork of a teenager gets taken down. The site is a notice and staydown site, on the record.

PORTSMOUTH, Va (Reuters) - Virginia groups opposed to discriminating against would-be adoptive and foster parents based on factors including sexuality and religion said on Thursday they may sue after a state board's decision.
New regulations — approved 5-1 at a Virginia Board of Social Services meeting on Wednesday — to take effect on May 1 will allow state-licensed adoption agencies to consider sexual orientation, age, disability, gender, family status and political beliefs when placing children.
American Civil Liberties Union of Virginia Legal Director Rebecca Glenberg branded the decision “terrible,” adding litigation is “under consideration.”
“It disserves children (by) allowing adoption agencies to exclude a wide range of potential adoptive parents,” she said.
Glenberg says there is no evidence gays are less suitable parents than straight people, “nor is there any evidence for excluding any of these other groups from protection.”
Claire Gastanaga, legislative counsel for Equality Virginia, said Virginia law allows both singles and married couples to adopt.
The board, she said, has permitted licensed agencies to tell prospective adoptive and foster parents, “we don't serve gay people, we don't serve people who are not (of) our religion, we don't serve people who are over a certain age, we don't serve people who have a disability.”
With 1,200 children in Virginia awaiting adoption and 6,000 in foster care, the move is especially regrettable, she added.
The board in April had initially voted to overturn anti-discrimination protections instigated in 2009 by then governor Timothy Kaine, a Democrat. But at the request of gay-advocacy groups, a public comment period was extended. The Department of Social Services received nearly 3,000 comments, mostly supporting the protections.
However, Catholics and some other faiths and groups argued Kaine's rules would have trampled religious freedom and a birth mother's right to decide what kind of person adopts her child.
The Rutherford Institute, described on its website as a civil liberties organization, said in its submission: “It is absolutely beyond the legitimate authority of any government agency to force faith-based agencies to choose between abandoning their adoption ministries or violating their sincerely-held religious beliefs.”
The Virginia Catholic Conference issued a statement hailing Wednesday's vote, saying faith-based agencies “have the right, under federal and state law, to make determinations according to their convictions and beliefs. The proper role of government is to respect and preserve this existing right.”
Gastanaga indicated court action may form part of Equality Virginia's efforts to “educate people as to why this is not the right or moral thing for the state to be a party to.”
Not all faith-based adoption agencies operating in Virginia discriminate against those who do not subscribe to their views.
United Methodist Family Services will “continue to serve a wide range of prospective adoptive parents and do not intend to discriminate as allowed by the new regulations,” CEO Greg Peters told Reuters in a statement on Thursday.
Virginia New Majority Executive Director Jon Liss said the new regulations would keep Virginia “in the past. It's really imposing some people's standards of what's appropriate sexuality on the whole society.”
He said the group would “quite likely” join any coordinated legal action.
We uncover a little known piece of Australian history and in doing so rekindle a long running argument between an amateur and professional scientist.
Batemans Bay holds a significant place in Australian yowie history.
This will be new information for many locals, but a dig through the archives unearths a rich history around this mythical Bigfoot-type creature and the South East of New South Wales.
Aboriginal communities are said to have known about and named the yowie prior to Cook and Phillip dropping anchor. It is believed that white man contact with the yowie was first documented in a formal sense on December 9 1882 in The Australian Town and Country Journal.
Amateur naturalist Henry James McCooey wrote of his encounter with a strange creature in bushland between Batemans Bay and Ulladulla.
His words from 132 years ago conjure a jaw-dropping image.
He writes:
"A few days ago I saw one of these strange animals in an unfrequented locality on the coast between Bateman's Bay and Ulladulla. My attention was attracted to it by the cries of a number of small birds which were pursuing and darting at it. When I first beheld the animal it was standing on its hind legs, partly upright, looking up at the birds above it in the bushes, blinking its eyes and distorting its visage and making a low chattering kind of noise. Being above the animal on a slight elevation and distant from it less than a chain, I had ample opportunity of noting its size and general appearance.
"I should think that if it were standing perfectly upright it would be nearly 5ft high. It was tailless and covered with very long black hair, which was of a dirty red or snuff-colour about the throat and breast. Its eyes, which were small and restless, were partly hidden by matted hair that covered its head. The length of the fore legs or arms seemed to be strikingly out of proportion with the rest of its body, but in all other respects its build seemed to be fairly proportional. It would probably weigh about 8st. On the whole it was a most uncouth and repulsive looking creature, evidently possessed of prodigious strength, and one which I should not care to come to close quarters with. Having sufficiently satisfied my curiosity, I throw a stone at the animal, whereupon it immediately rushed off, followed by the birds, and disappeared in a ravine which was close at hand."
What a sight!
Myf Thompson, volunteer curator at the Old Court House Museum in Batemans Bay, says it's a piece of the town's history that is news to her and isn't widely known.
Upon learning of this local yowie link, Myf tossed her plans for the day out the window and researched further. The National Libraries bank of digitized newspapers along with Wikipedia and various yowie websites combined to add to the story.
Myf uncovered a stand-off between McCooey and the curator of the Australian Museum in Sydney at the time, Edward Pierson Ramsay.
Records suggest that Mr Ramsay questioned the existence of such a creature which in those days of the colony was also described as an 'Australian ape'.
Looking at those early documents, Myf believes that McCooey and his claims were poo-pooed by academics like Ramsay because he was an amateur.
We only have one side of the back and forth between the two but clearly it's a passionate debate.
Again in The Australian Town and Country Journal, McCooey writes:
"The mere fact of no apes [are] found in the Sydney Museum does not justify us in rushing to the conclusion that there are none in the colony, for it is extremely improbable that any ape will be foolhardy enough to present itself at the museum to undergo the somewhat delicate operation of stuffing; and beyond the fact that there are, none to be found in the Sydney Museum there is not one scintilla of evidence to prove that they are not to be found in the colony, while there is abundance of evidence to show that they are."
Imagine Ramsay's reaction at reading that.
McCooey goes on trying to prove his case:
"I do not claim to be the first who has seen this animal, for I can put my finger on half a dozen men at Bateman's Bay who have seen the same, or at any rate an animal of a similar description; but I think I am the first to come forward in the columns of a newspaper and give publicity to the fact of having seen it.
"I may mention that a search party was organised at Bateman's Bay some months ago to surround the locality [and] the supposed ape... and shoot or capture it, but the idea was abandoned in consequence of the likelihood of gun accidents; and I may further state that the skeleton of an ape, 4ft in length, may be seen at any time in a cave 14 miles from Bateman's Bay, in the direction of Ulladulla."
It appears that in December of 1882, Ramsay offered McCooey 100 pounds to bring in his yowie dead or alive. McCooey believed it was a challenge he could meet but, as far as we can tell, the 100 pounds wasn't claimed.
Eleven months later on October 20 1883 the discourse is still bubbling between the two men.
McCooey, writing from Mandurama between Bathurst and Cowra on October 15 1883, says:
"...the position taken by the Curator of the Museum is absolutely untenable... there are indigenous apes in this colony...they have been frequently seen in Budawong mountains, in Jingera mountains, and in the Abercrombie mountains, at Bateman's Bay, at Mount Macdonald, and on the Guy Fawkes-road between Armidale and Grafton...apes were known to the aborigines of this colony, and were dreaded by them, long before a museum was founded in Australia, or a white man crossed the Murray; and that one was actually captured and killed near Braidwood within the memory of persons still living."
Referring to her understanding of the research, Myf Thompson feels Ramsay questioned McCooey's motivations, suggesting he was more interested in claiming the money, and that it was the amateur naturalist who suggested the cash reward not him. Ramsay's impression is perhaps built on talk at the time of McCooey's criminal record which points to claims of fraud.
Ramsay also seemed to suggest that the Australian landscape couldn't sustain a creature such as McCooey's.
Speculation continues to this day about the existence of a yowie in local bush land.
Callers to ABC South East point to sightings and gossip between 1960 and the early 80s around the Budawangs and at the top of Clyde Mountain at the head of the Clyde River, adding to McCooey's case. However, like Ramsay 130 years ago, we wait for firm evidence.
What isn't in doubt is Batemans Bay's connection with this unique Australian story, perhaps rediscovering it in 2014 will bring more talk.
*The Old Court House Museum is run by the Clyde River and Batemans Bay Historical Society and is open Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday between 10am and 3pm and on the second Sunday of each month between 10am and 1pm in Museum Place Batemans Bay.

Human remains found inside monster Australian crocodile
Saltwater crocodiles are protected in Australia

Australian police are examining human remains found in a crocodile to see if they match the DNA of a missing man.
The 62-year-old man was snatched from his boat in the Kakadu National Park, in the Northern Territory.
The 4.7m-long (15.4ft) reptile was one of two shot by park rangers near the scene of the attack.
The man's wife, son and daughter-in-law were reported to have been with him on the South Alligator River when he disappeared on Saturday.
"The human remains have been taken for examination," Sgt Andrew Hocking said.
"There are a number of statements to be taken from witnesses and a file will be prepared for the coroner."
Experts said that it was unusual for a crocodile to attack during this time of year when Australia experiences cooler weather.
Police are urging visitors to be careful when visiting the Kakadu National Park
The shot crocodile, the same species as this one, was nearly 5m in length
Saltwater crocodiles can grow up 7m long and weigh more than a tonne.
Crocodile numbers have increased since being declared a protected species in 1971. They are a common feature of Australia's tropical north.
The Australian government rejected a controversial plan to allow crocodile safari hunting in the Northern Territory in March.
Australian police shot two crocodiles dead in January while on a search for a missing 12-year-old boy attacked by a crocodile in the Northern Territory.
Another man was killed by a crocodile in August last year, when he swam in a river in the north during a birthday party.
Spanish online supporters of Julian Assange called for worldwide demonstrations Saturday to press for the release of the WikiLeaks founder, who is in a London jail awaiting possible extradition to Sweden to face rape charges.
The Spanish website Free Wikileaks urged rallies at 6 p.m. (1700 GMT) in eight Spanish cities, including Madrid and Barcelona, while similar demonstrations were planned in Amsterdam, Buenos Aires, Mexico City, São Paulo, Bogota and Lima.
In a manifesto entitled “For freedom, Say No to State Terrorism,” it demanded “the release of Julian Assange in the United Kingdom” and “the restoration of the WikiLeaks domain.”
“Given that no one has proved that Assange is guilty of the offences he is accused of and that Wikileaks is not implicated in any of those,” the website also urged that credit card giants Visa and Mastercard rescind their decisions to cut off payments from the whistleblowing website's supporters.
Assange is due to appear in a London court for a second time Tuesday after being arrested on a warrant issued by Sweden. Prosecutors there want to question him about two women's allegations of rape and sexual molestation.
WikiLeaks insists the allegations are politically motivated because the website has enraged Washington and governments around the world by releasing a treasure trove of 250,000 confidential US documents, believed to have been supplied by a junior US army intelligence analyst.
The 39-year-old Australian has been transferred from the main section of Wandsworth prison to an isolation unit, according to Jennifer Robinson, one of his legal team.
In the Netherlands, 75 people gathered in central Amsterdam to show their support for WikiLeaks, police spokesman Rob van der Veen told AFP.
The Amsterdam rally was sponsored by the Dutch Pirates Party “to call for protection of freedom of the press” and “to express displeasure with the attempt to silence” sites such as WikiLeaks.
Assange supporters in Lima scheduled their demonstration outside the British embassy.
Meanwhile new leaked US diplomatic cables revealed a row between the Vatican and Ireland over a child abuse inquiry.
The Holy See hit back after cables released by WikiLeaks indicated it had refused to cooperate with an Irish probe into child sex abuse by Catholic priests in Dublin.
According to another leaked cable made available to The New York Times and other news organizations, US diplomats believe that some top members of the Vatican's hierarchy still harbor anti-Semitic views.
“Naturally these reports reflect the perceptions and opinions of the people who wrote them and cannot be considered as expressions of the Holy See itself, nor as exact quotations of the words of its officials,” it said.
“Their reliability must, then, be evaluated carefully and with great prudence, bearing this circumstance in mind.”
In other disclosures, mining giant BHP Billiton was said to have lobbied the Australian government hard to bring down a proposed 19.5 billion US dollar deal between its rival Rio Tinto and China's Chinalco.
Spokesmen for BHP and Rio Tinto refused to comment on the US diplomatic cable published in The Sydney Morning Herald on Saturday.
Assange's attorneys meanwhile complained that their client was getting no recreation time in the prison and was having difficulties getting phone calls out. “He is on his own,” Robinson she said.
The former computer hacker was not allowed to have a laptop in his cell, but his lawyers have requested one.
Assange was described as in “very good” spirits but “frustrated” that he could not answer the allegations that WikiLeaks was behind cyberattacks launched on credit card firms that have refused to do business with the website.
“He told me he is absolutely not involved and this is a deliberate attempt to conflate WikiLeaks, which is a publishing organisation, with hacking organisations which are not,” Robinson said.
And Assange's mother said she was worried for her son because “massive forces” were ranged against him. She dismissed the rape accusations, but told Australia's Seven Network she was concerned about what would happen to him.
Half of all premature deaths from colorectal cancer (described as deaths in people ages 25 to 64) in the United States are linked to ethnic, socioeconomic, and geographic inequalities, and therefore could be prevented according to a new study by American Cancer Society researchers. The report, which appears in the Journal of Clinical Oncology, found more preventable deaths occur in southern states than in northern and western states, but that in virtually all states those with the least education had significantly higher colorectal cancer death rates.
Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third leading cause of cancer death for both men and women in the U.S. Historically, death rates were higher in those with higher socioeconomic status, in whites, and in northern states. Over the past few decades, though, that switched, with death rates now highest in persons with the lowest socioeconomic status, in blacks, and in southern states. That shift is likely the result of access to better early detection and treatment.
To better understand the extent to which these racial/ethnic and socioeconomic disparities vary within each state and contribute to premature death as a result of colorectal cancer, American Cancer Society researchers led by Ahmedin Jemal, Ph.D., looked at CRC death rates in people between ages 25 and 64 by state, race/ethnicity, and educational attainment (as a marker of socioeconomic status), using data from the National Vital Statistics System of the National Center for Health Statistics (part of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention). The age range of 25 to 64 was chosen because in this age group, a greater number of life-years are lost and because cancer disparities are larger in this age group than in age 65 and above, in part due to differences in the availability of universal healthcare coverage.
The researchers found that among people ages 25 to 64, those with the least education had significantly higher CRC death rates in virtually all states for each racial/ethnic group. In the most dramatic example, in New Mexico those non-Hispanic whites with the lowest educational attainment were at more than three times the risk of CRC death as non-Hispanic whites with the highest educational attainment. The researchers conclude that half of all CRC deaths in those ages 25 to 64 that occurred nationwide from 2008 through 2010 would have been avoided if everyone had experienced the lowest death rates of the most educated whites, or 7,690 CRC deaths every year.
The authors say more premature deaths were avertable in southern states (60% to 70%) than in northern and western states (30% to 40%). When the analysis was restricted to those ages 50 to 64, for whom CRC screening is recommended, the disparities by educational attainment within state or cross states were remarkably similar.
The authors note that the factors that contribute to CRC disparities are complex and multifactorial. Differences in income, education, insurance status, and geographic residence between sociodemographic groups result in inequalities in the prevalence of CRC risk factors as well as in access to screening and treatment services. The prevalence of behavioral risk factors for CRC varies geographically and is generally inversely associated with SES. Obesity, cigarette smoking, and red meat consumption increase CRC risk, whereas physical activity and anti-inflammatory drug use decrease risk.
Even if you've tried virtual reality or already own a VR system, nothing has prepared you for what's coming over the next month. Three major VR platforms are expected to launch before Thanksgiving Day with massive announcements and retail roll-outs in the works.
Despite our dogged pursuit of VR news at UploadVR, the technology is still the stuff of science fiction for most people: VR may have appeared in a couple news reports or been seen as an ad for the Samsung Gear VR on TV a couple times. Maybe you even own a Google Cardboard box you can slip your phone inside. That, though, is not representative of the new generation of VR technology about to hit the market next month. Soon, it will be hard to escape the fact that VR is here to stay.
As someone who obsessively followed this technology since 2012, I've gotten to watch the steady growth of this industry beginning with just a Kickstarter campaign. After two years, it was an industry seeing countless experts hired by tech giants and billions of dollars invested by the likes of Facebook, Sony, and Google. Over the next few years, platform construction accelerated and the first consumer products debuted.
Now, though, the real excitement begins.
Google Daydream
Starting October 4, VR is heading for mainstream adoption in a way that was not possible before. Google will be holding a press event where the company may debut a reference VR headset for its Daydream platform. We'd also expect a slate of content announcements and partnerships to expand upon the sparse details we heard from Google at its developer conference earlier this year. Above, for instance, are manufacturers said to have been developing phones compatible with the new Daydream platform.
It cannot be understated the role Google played in popularizing the basic concepts of VR with countless cardboard box viewers distributed over the last few years. It also cannot be understated just how many developers Google might bring into VR as the company expands its Play store. Daydream is the natural evolution of Google's efforts, bringing basic motion controls into mobile VR.

Oculus Touch
The day after Google's event, Oculus kicks off its third developer conference on October 5. At the same event last year, the company debuted partnerships that would bring Minecraft, Netflix, and many more top-tier applications to Oculus-compatible headsets.
The company also showed its Oculus Touch controllers in social VR — that is, you and someone else had their hand, head movements, and voice seamlessly transported into a shared virtual world. The company debuted Oculus Medium, too, a jaw-dropping creation app that might find use to model objects that one day artists could animate for a movie or print out in 3D to bring into the real world. Medium, a sculpting app, is in the same category as Google's Tilt Brush, which is more like sketching software.
These apps, combined with the broader release of controllers that bring your hands into VR, might move the technology more firmly into the category of professional art tool over the next year or two. HTC Vive led the way April, shipping the first tracked hand controllers and kicking off an incredible period of innovation by developers across the globe, such as Tvori in Russia and Mindshow in Los Angeles. Touch should push the technology much farther. The first step is to launch more than 30 Touch-compatible games this year. Very quickly, though, it might become difficult for you to be a 3D artist or designer who doesn't work with their models in VR.
PlayStation VR
On October 13, one week after the Oculus conference, Sony releases its PlayStation VR headset. At $399, it costs more than some versions of the console itself, but preorders sold out faster than any hardware ever at GameStop. It is compatible with millions of PlayStation 4 systems already in people's homes, and Sony promises more than 50 games compatible with the headset through the end of 2016.
We're still unclear whether Sony has social or creation software figured out for the console-based system, but they are making a big play for gamers with a super-comfortable headset. Sony's entry into the industry offers a lower cost alternative to Rift and Vive, but it's also a lower resolution experience compared to those PC-based systems. It's not yet clear what kind of impact PS VR might have beyond gamers, but the prelaunch sales indicate it's already doing well.
Social VR
This year, Oculus moved Facebook integration deeper into its platform and deprecated the original plan for a social software development kit. It's now very easy to add your Facebook friends to a list you can access in VR. But what can you do with your friends once they are there with you in virtual reality?
That's the question we expect Oculus to answer at its Oculus Connect 3 conference in San Jose from October 5 to October 7. It was almost a year ago when we discovered terms connected to the Oculus Video application that promise that you could watch traditional movies you rented or purchased from Oculus with up to five other people in VR.
An Oculus platform that knows if you have an active subscription to Netflix or Hulu might let you binge watch the next season of Stranger Things sitting in a virtual home theater with people who physically live far away. And if you can create a Medium sculpture in VR with someone else there with you, that future where you need VR for 3D art work might be here sooner rather than later.
At the first Oculus developer conference in 2014, the chief scientist at Oculus, Michael Abrash, said “we haven't seen the thing that's going to cause people to have to use VR day after day because it's so compelling.” I remain convinced social VR is that critical feature and it needs to be implemented well in the majority of VR applications to really take off. From bulletin boards in the '80s to Facebook today, one of the Internet's primary uses is to connect us directly with one another. VR can actually bring you face-to-face with people who are far away and we've only gotten hints of what impact this might have up to now.
November and beyond
At the beginning of November, the Virtual Reality Developers Conference kicks off in San Francisco. Originally held earlier this year as an add-on to the Game Developers Conference, its first sessions were so overcrowded that organizers set aside larger rooms for virtual reality sessions the next day. Now a standalone conference is November 2 and November 3. It may represent the last opportunity for VR developers to show off their applications before the holiday season really kicks into gear.
Last year at this time there were no consumer headsets on the market. You could get a cardboard box for your phone and it would still be a few weeks before the new plastic View-Master arrived on store shelves. By Black Friday 2015, the first consumer Gear VR was available. You could walk into a T-Mobile or AT&T store and educate the salesperson about VR if you really wanted to buy one.
By mid-2016, the Rift and Vive were available, initially purchased by folks looking at specification sheets rather than buying from hands-on experience with the new hardware. Heading into Black Friday 2016, though, Best Buy and GameStop are likely to see prominent placements for VR equipment so people can try for themselves. You will be able to purchase VR systems from Samsung, Facebook, Sony, HTC or a number of partners working with Google at price points spread out between less than $100 and more than $1,500. There will be hundreds of apps available, led by games but extending to social experiences and professional 3D art creation tools.
The span from October's Google event through to Black Friday is a critical period, where millions of consumers are likely to bring their first true VR headset into the house. Get ready.

The Republican National Committee was ordered by a federal judge to turn over any evidence of agreements—written or verbal—between Donald Trump's presidential campaign and the GOP involving voter fraud, ballot security, and poll-watching or monitoring. In his late Monday ruling, U.S. District Judge John Michael Vazquez of New Jersey said the organization must hand over all material to the Democratic National Committee by Wednesday. The DNC has in recent weeks accused GOP officials of conspiring with the Republican presidential nominee to suppress minority-voter turnout. Vazquez, however, denied the DNC's other requests, including communications related to a statement made by Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway, who stated her team was “actively working with the national committee, the official party, and campaign lawyers to monitor precincts around the country.” Vice-presidential candidate Mike Pence made a similar statement, and the DNC requested information related to that as well; Vazquez denied that request, too. A hearing over the DNC's voter-suppression allegations is scheduled for Nov. 4.
Not long ago, I frequently used the word "conditioning." I thought the best way to condition athletes was through anaerobic workouts that tested the limits of pain and pushed the boundaries of regurgitation. After all, we're taught that sports are anaerobic, and that blasé aerobic work has no place in a serious program.
Today, the word "conditioning" makes me cringe. As you can imagine, I cringe a lot. And, unlike before, vomit-inducing anaerobic work is rarely in the cards for me or my athletes. Thanks to people way smarter than me (Joel Jamieson, James Smith, Buddy Morris) I have an appreciation for different types of "conditioning," much like I have an appreciation for different types of strength.
Conditioning Conundrum
I can't define "conditioning" as the very word is akin to the phrase "lifting weights." You can lift weights in many ways and for many reasons. Most of us do it to get stronger. But others do it for more specific reasons, like training for strength-speed, strength-endurance, and starting strength. For those of you that managed to get past the first ten pages of Supertraining, you know this list continues seemingly ad infinitum.
So if we lift weights to get stronger, do we perform conditioning to become more conditioned? The problem is ambiguity. We have different types of "conditioning" just like we have different types of strength.
Conditioning, in its true sense, refers to training the body's energy systems. We easily distinguish between the anaerobic (without oxygen) and aerobic (with oxygen) systems. We even associate different body types to proficiency in each system. Jacked football players and sprinters are anaerobic beasts. Gangly marathoners, however, are aerobic creatures.
But neither stereotype is correct because jacked football players frequently rely on the aerobic system. Yeah, I said it. Football is aerobic. Before I face the stones, let me explain.
Energy Systems
Breaking the energy systems into anaerobic and aerobic isn't enough. The anaerobic system can be further split into the alactic pathway and the lactic pathway. Each corresponds with the energy deriving metabolic processes.
Alactic Anaerobic – (ATP-CP) – 1 to 12 seconds – Immediate
Lactic Anaerobic – (Glycolytic) – 60 to 90 seconds – Intermediate
Aerobic – Hours – Long term
Bottom line is, all anaerobic work is not created equally. Football is a prime example. In an effort to "condition," coaches rely on suicides, Prowler pushes, and Tabata intervals until their athletes' legs are loaded with lactate and loopier than Gumby's.
Anaerobic? Absolutely.
But the right kind of anaerobic? Nope.
Another Dimension
Next, it's important to know that each metabolic pathway has a power component (how fast the system can derive energy) and capacity component (how long the system can be sustained).
So someone with great alactic power can produce a few intensive bursts of energy at a high level. This, for example, includes an Olympic weightlifter, powerlifter, 100m sprinter, javelin thrower, shot-putter, etc. These athletes give a maximal effort, blow their load, and take a long time to recover. Just think of hitting a PR in the gym. It's not easily repeatable.
Someone with great alactic power and capacity, however, can replicate intensive efforts over time – a baseball pitcher, for example. A pitcher with amazing alactic power will hit triple digits on the radar gun. But if their capacity sucks, their speed will diminish with each successive throw. So a pitcher with good capacity and decent power is likely to be a starter. One with a lot of power and shady capacity, however, more likely a closer.
Importance Of Capacity
Many sports require short-term explosiveness – alactic anaerobic power. This is why the NFL Combine gawks at 4.3 speed.
Over the past few years, aerobic work has been vilified for decreasing absolute explosive potential. But most sports require capacity in addition to power. There are problems if 4.3 speed turns into 4.7 speed during the second quarter, 5.5 speed during the third quarter, and 6.1 speed during the fourth quarter.
Ray Lewis isn't known for playing six downs and calling it quits. He's known for being on the field every play and always performing at a high level.
So what's more important, absolute power, or the capacity to sustain power? Wouldn't it be better to run a consistent 4.5 and sacrifice a little power for a lot of capacity?
The Aerobic System's Role
There are two underappreciated aspects of the aerobic system. First, it's very important in developing alactic anaerobic capacity (think explosive stuff). Second, most sports are aerobic despite the common perception.
Upon exercise, all energy systems turn on. The power clean is rooted in alactic anaerobic power because of its short duration, not because the aerobic system fails to ignite. The duration, not the intensity, determines energy system involvement.
As repeat sprint exercise continues, the energy system contributions become "truer" to their respective time zones. And each successive explosive bout increasingly relies on the aerobic system (1)(2).
But studies emerged about aerobic work diminishing explosive ability. And we all got caught up in absolute power, foregoing capacity.
"Despite the endless promotion of interval training as the only form of training necessary,"> Joel Jamieson says, "the world of combat sports has not seen a noticeable increase in conditioning over this time. If anything, the general conditioning level of fighters today is worse than it's been in the past."
Basketball is another example. There are some sprints and jumps here and there, but for the most part you see guys trotting up and down the court. Yeah, they're jogging. Fancy that.
Somehow we're brainwashed into thinking that athletes never jog, but it happens in nearly every sport. In soccer, unless the ball is in their vicinity, athletes lazily move about the field. Football? Jogging to and from the sideline and back to the line after every play.
And what about athletes with their faces in oxygen masks (even though they don't really work)? I don't foresee Boba Fett inspired uniforms with oxygen tank backpacks anytime soon, so these guys better start fixing their shitty aerobic development.
To be fair, the sports mentioned also have a short-term explosive component, which makes respecting the work-to-rest interval important. A 2009 study found that, "More than 70% of the total [soccer] match duration was performed at low "aerobic" intensities, while only 1-3% of the match was performed at high-intensities ("sprinting") (3). The overall work-to-rest ratio of these soccer players averaged out to a 2-4 second sprint every 90 seconds."
In math speak that interval looks like 4:90. Football usually shakes out to 6:40, barring a two-minute drill (in which case it becomes even more aerobic). Olympic weightlifting, at minimum rest, is about 3:120. Truer alactic anaerobic sports like javelin and the 100m have even longer rest periods.
Compare those ratios to Tabata's 20:10. Not even close.
Aerobic Work vs. Lifting Weights
Way back, nearly all athletes performed aerobic work. Bill Starr writes about running in The Strongest Shall Survive. Thomas Kurz in The Science of Sports Training notes that weightlifters jog in the early off-season. Old school fighters were known for doing roadwork. Hell, even Ricky Bruch, the eccentric discus thrower, jogged.
Now, aerobic work is shunned. But the aerobic system not only increases overall health markers but also aids in recovery from heavy weight training sessions.
As discussed in Heart Rate Variability Training, an over active sympathetic nervous system – a pitfall of shitty aerobic development – destroys performance.
"Compared to more average competitors, Olympic caliber athletes and Special Operations personnel have simultaneously stronger sympathetic responses during competition and higher parasympathetic input during rest. They swing further to either side of the continuum.
They tend to have lower baseline stress hormones with greater diurnal variation of cortisol, meaning that they have significantly higher levels of cortisol in the morning than in the evening, which allows their body to fluctuate between higher arousal during the day and deeper recovery at night."
It's like this: a developed aerobic system kick starts the recovery process. More time recovering means more recovery.
Also, you're able to save and concentrate "intense" bouts of energy for when they really matter. The opposite of this being in a constantly amped up state and slowly wearing yourself down – this is what I referred to as "idling" in 12 Tips to Tune the Nervous System.
Methods of Aerobic Development
Aerobic doesn't always mean distance running. As long as your heart rate stays around 120-150 BPM (everyone has a different lactate threshold) and lactate doesn't accumulate, you're training the aerobic system. "Fun" things outside of distance running are stringing together a circuit of the following:
Rope jumping
Calisthenics
Mobility exercises
Tumbling and locomotor movements (cartwheels, forward rolls, backward rolls to handstands, inch worm walks, and bear crawls)
But if you enjoy running, tempo runs, essentially "low intensity" interval training, are a great choice. Tempo runs involve running a predetermined distance in a time window that's of a low enough intensity to tax the aerobic system and yet fail to go anaerobic (70 yards in 20 seconds, for instance). Once the distance is covered, the runner can rest for thirty-or-so seconds to keep the heart rate in check before doing another heat.
More specific to a lifter, however, is a method used by track coach Dan Pfaff that consists of doing many sets of Olympic lifts over the course of 50+ minutes for 1-2 reps, striving to keep the heart rate around 150 BPM.
Ultimately, the best aerobic work matches the specific demands of training. A circuit of push-ups, squats, and pull-ups can train the aerobic system, but it isn't ideal for a soccer player. Lance Armstrong isn't a world class marathon runner. His adaptations are specific to riding a bike.
Conclusion
Aerobic work is making a comeback. All conditioning isn't created equally. What's the work : rest interval? What energy system(s) are utilized? Do you need capacity? Power? Or both?
One thing is for sure: you could stand to do a bit more aerobic work. That is, unless you're holding out for the Boba Fett technology.

How to write SQL Stored Procedure Script in SAP HANA
This tutorial is about how to write SQL script in SAP HANA stored procedure in order to create a complex calculation on the fly to generate a report from pulling the data from the table
Table definition
Below we can see a table with four columns as follows:
DEPTID(INT)
CITY (NVARCHAR)
QUARTER (NVARCHAR)
SALARY (DECIMAL)
The commission percentage is based on department ID's therefore,we have 3 department ids
DEPTID1 = 20% of salary
DEPTID2 = 30% of salary
DEPTID3 = 40% of salary
We need a complex calculation which we can build by using a case expression by using a stored procedure.
Therefore we move over to HANA system where we see a table DEPTTOTPAYROLL with following:
3 Department Ids
DEPTID1, DEPTID2, DEPTID3
3 CITY
SEATLE, TACOMA, REDMOND
AND QUARTER
Q1, Q2, Q3
Creating SQL Procedure
For creating SQL procedure we must first go to SQL Interface
In SQL Interface please run this code to create SQL procedure DEPT_PAYROLL_COM
Create Procedure SCHEMANAME.DEPT_PAYROLL_COMM (IN VarDepID INTEGER, IN VarQuartr NVARCHAR (2)) LANGUAGE SQLSCRIPT AS
BEGIN
SELECT "DEPTID", "CITY", "QUARTER", "SALARY"
CASE "DEPTID"
WHEN 1 THEN "SALARY" = 0.20
WHEN 2 THEN "SALARY" = 0.30
WHEN 3 THEN "SALARY" = 0.40
END AS COMISSION
FROM "SCHEMANAME" . "DEPTTOTPAYROll"
WHERE "DEPTID" = :VarDepID AND "QUARTER" = :VarQuartr
END;
Note: Variable :VarDepID and :VarQuartr which is used to pull information.
After creating the SQL Procedure we can call the procedure by executing this code
call "SCHEMANAME" . "DEPT_PAYROLL_COMM" (2. 'Q3')
Convert Crypto to Spend Bitcoin at Over 32 Million Contactless Terminals Worldwide — By Proxy
Danial Daychopan Blocked Unblock Follow Dec 19, 2015
Plutus is a mobile app that lets you Tap & Pay using Bitcoin at NFC-enabled terminals worldwide. Under the hood, it's powered by a true peer-to-peer, decentralised exchange network.
In the Bitcoin community, a merchant starting to accept the digital currency is still a notable celebration that echoes throughout the community. But sadly this is still a surprisingly difficult accomplishment.
“I've never seen a problem that was solved by only complaining about it.” — Steve Keating
But we didn't want to wait for merchants to catch up, which is why we developed Plutus, a way to use Bitcoins to pay almost anywhere you like.
You simply send crypto to the address displayed on the app, it's then converted to fiat via our peer to peer exchange and within minutes you are ready to spend it in stores.
Plutus uses smart contracts on the blockchain to convert your digital currency to fiat currency before it is charged to a virtual debit card (token) secured inside the app. Once this process is completed, your mobile device is ready to manage your balance for in store or online purchases.
This even allows the users to replace their Oyster card with a Bitcoin app to travel on the Transport of London!
How it works — in 5 steps
1. You send crypto to an address displayed on the Plutus app.
2. The coins are forwarded automatically to verified traders on the decentralised exchange in exchange for an offer in USD, EUR, etc.
3. The smart contact (DEX) running on the Ethereum platform recognises that the traders have received your bitcoins, and their equivalent fiat deposit is released to your Plutus debit card balance automatically.
4. You can now use your Plutus balance to pay at any NFC-enabled POS terminal in the world.
5. The merchant always receives payment in their preferred currency through the global debit card network.
In the end, the intent of the app is to be practical. Plutus was never intended to be ‘disruptive' (especially since it plugs into existing infrastructure). It's simply a stepping stone towards adoption and a practical use-case that many have been asking for. Plutus doesn't hold any user's digital currency, as all transactions are sent to traders in accordance with the peer-to-peer philosophy of bitcoin.
Simply having a quantifiable advantage over your competition, such as being faster or cheaper often isn't enough. Intuition tells us that these benefits should be adequate to convince people to switch platforms, but switching to a slightly better option is almost never worth the risk and cost of changing the current system.
(Unfortunately, this is something I learned the hard way with my previous project.)
Why? Because of a fascinating concept called the Prospect Theory.
Prospect Theory was first developed by Nobel Prize winning economist Daniel Kahneman and brought to my attention by William Mougayar. It states that people tend to be more risk seeking in the domain of losses, and risk averse in the domain of gains. In simple terms, people seek safety and security when choosing a service, and will hesitate to switch to a newer one once they have made their decision.
We addressed this concern by going far beyond the status quo, introducing decentralisation and efficiency to the exchange of Bitcoin and fiat.
The Plutus app lets you pay at any NFC terminal in the world, but the real innovation is the decentralised exchange that powers it. The Plutus DEX connects users and traders directly in a fully peer-to-peer exchange running on the Ethereum network, eliminating various types of risk by not holding any user coins or relying on 3rd party exchange as well as creating the potential to dramatically lower fees through market pressure.
Plutus will be the first and most advanced payments application on the market, built around a decentralised technology.
Conclusion
The number of people around the world who are earning bitcoin through work, mining, trading, etc is rapidly growing. And they are well aware how difficult it is to spend them, especially considering local brick & mortar merchants. Often this is impossible. To overcome this challenge is why Plutus was first developed. With Plutus, you can spend your bitcoin without waiting for merchants to accept it! It's an optimal use case and killer app for anyone whose income is denominated in bitcoin.

A pervert who stockpiled abuse images and videos of children as young as two has had his sentence cut after judges heard he was going through a "gender identity crisis" at the time.
London's Criminal Appeal Court was told it was Sarbjeet Jagdev's confusion over his sexuality the LED him to view and store 1,400 sexual images of very young girls.
Because of his "strict upbringing", the 23-year-old, of Ambassador Road, Goodwood, Leicester, had been "unable to confront" his belief that he was transgender.
Jagdev was jailed for three years at Leicester Crown Court in May after he admitted seven counts of possessing indecent images of children.
But Mr Justice Spencer, sitting at the Appeal Court with Lord Justice Flaux and Judge David Aubrey QC, cut his sentence to two years.
The court heard that, after his arrest last year, Jagdev sought counselling and therapy for his gender issues and compulsion to view child porn.
His lawyers told the court: "There is substantial evidence that he tried to address his offending behaviour.
"For some years, he had been troubled by a crisis of gender identity which he had been unable to confront."
Allowing the appeal, Mr Justice Spencer said: "There was a high volume of images and they included moving images.
"The fundamental question is whether the judge took a starting point which was manifestly excessive having regard to the mitigation.
"He had expressed and demonstrated remorse and started to address his offending behaviour.
"In the circumstances the proper sentence here were two years."
“Modern Zen”
To many people they hear the word Zen and what flashes to them in their head is the beginning scene of Ang Lee Kung-Fu movie. They, I mean I, imagine myself usually with a shaved head on top of a mountain training with other monks to find the meaning of the universe, and finding enlightenment through isolation. In reality though I'm Jim Carrey in Ace Ventura 2, and the monks want nothing to do with me. Unless I am smoking them out.
I try to explain this like it is an art form but in reality this comes natural to all, a place a peace Zen. (See dictionary definition)The dictionary defines Zen as; that emphasizes enlightenment for the student by the most direct possible means, accepting formal studies and observances only when they form part of such means. But in a world when we define the reality by our perceptions and; AMERICA, we can really decide what Zen means to ourselves. In 2015.
So I took to my good buddy the Facebook and asked my comrades, “What does Zen mean to you?” I looked at all these informative states of minds and I realized everybody put out parts of themselves. I mean that everyone that participated, spoke from a part within them that they drew strength from.
Be it of a childhood idol, like legendary coach like Phil Jackson, a Family, a place of comfort, a book a faith. I wasn't surprised when a sports bros chose Phil Jackson, the ones who lost family member or are close with them said things of their family and the ones religiously connected spoke from, whatever book of virtues. Let me say how it is, its cliché and over said but Zen is inside you, somewhere.
Disney is doing a movie currently where the characters emotions are actually characters within their heads. And from the years of therapy I've taken and the culmination of friends opinions I have had, I've come to believe that's not far off from accurate depiction of what's going on up there. I believe we all have parts to ourselves that come from our apex times in our lives.
(me in therapy)
We have parts in ourselves that will live forever within in us, from moments where we lived in highly emotional places (in our brains anyway). We will always have these parts within us that will always be sad about how we were the only kid not on the block to have a Sega, or that part in you where you voted prom king by all your friends, you'll always be the person who got broken up with after you got fired from your job and you'll luckily always be the person that first went for their dreams.
You may be asking yourself now, what is the role of these parts within in me other than making me unfulfilled and confused about what I want and do, and what do these parts have to do with Zen. Well if you are asking this question, I have an answer for you. In my opinion, you have out grown the needs of these parts of you and you no longer no how to satisfy them. And when you're in a state of Zen and peace, you are having conversations with all of these insatiable sides that finally feel they have a voice within you about your actions.
Come away with me in your brain real quick. Imagine a moment in your life beyond understanding, where no matter what you did all day you felt like what you did you weren't doing it right. Got that day in your brain, now how old did you feel at that frustrating moment? Not how old you were at that frustrating moment, how old did you feel? Did you feel like that kid who didn't have a Sega at 6 and at the time that 17 year old who just got broken up after work? Now ask yourself what made those people happy, what made them sad what made do anything at all. I bet you those people inside you have some pretty good advice to share with you, about how your feeling right now.
Right now I am on search of a few answers for my own emotions. When I tend to find the answers I am looking for, when all things start to make a little bit of more sense, there are moments when the world stops and it is just me for a second. You know the moments, when work isn't an issue, when your relationship status isn't worrisome and there isn't a care in the world. It comes for me in many different ways. In millisecond moments of awe, forced isolation and meditation for an hour but more than likely it's either a good car ride or a shower. What those moments have in common is one solid thing, it's all about me. It's all about the answer I find within myself. It might be something I came up with or it might be something someone else said that gets me by, but it is the words I took and I applied to myself that made me better. I have answers. Some answers. For myself.
You have the answers, you have some answers when you are upset with a situation that you can't understand, you have some answers when you are extremely happy and can't contain yourself with joy. It is just about satisfying all your justifiable parts within yourself, you just need to make the space to let it happen. As for who is the one who justifies within you, look no further it is the one currently reading this article. The person that is the coach and most influential to all of your parts is the person you are at this moment that goes for all moments forward in life.
If all of your answers come to you in a bubble bath with a glass of Cabernet, a 3 hour binge on PlayStation or sitting down just having conversation with friends over a campfire. Remember that shit and go to it and go do it, it's needed. If all of you have been a second in the bathroom because you got kids (big up to the parents out there) remember that shit too. You got this under control. Don't let anyone ever tell you Zen only comes from sitting on top of the mountain obtaining universal peace. Zen is in which you define.
You got this because you have been through this all before. Not in the same way exact but in some scenario, minor or more major you have. One of places you can find those answers are in your moments of Zen. At the end of the day you, all of you and all your parts define your moment Zen, no one else can tell you where to find it. What I surely do know that it is that moment that lets the world stop and have some inner damn peace. Hold on to your inner peace and don't let it go, everything is possible its 2015.

In July, NASA's New Horizons spacecraft will make its closest pass of Pluto, giving us a look at a whole new class of planet in a little-known region of our solar system. It still has millions and millions of miles left to go, but on Tuesday, NASA released a new image taken by the vessel: For the first time ever, an approaching spacecraft has captured Pluto (and its largest moon) in living color.

[Over nine years after its launch, New Horizons' first images of Pluto have arrived]
Yes, the image is blurry. And tiny. And generally unimpressive, if you don't know what you're looking at. But soon we'll see much more. At a news conference Tuesday, NASA scientists explained that at New Horizons' current resolution, the Earth would be so blurry that continents couldn't be distinguished. But by the time the spacecraft is at its closest approach, the pictures taken will have resolution so high that comparable pictures of Earth would reveal a birds-eye view of New York City, with features like Central Park and the Hudson River fully visible. The images we'll see of Pluto and its moons will be truly unprecedented.
"This is pure exploration; we're going to turn points of light into a planet and a system of moons before your eyes!" Alan Stern, New Horizons principal investigator, said in a statement. "New Horizons is flying to Pluto — the biggest, brightest and most complex of the dwarf planets in the Kuiper Belt. This 21st century encounter is going to be an exploration bonanza unparalleled in anticipation since the storied missions of Voyager in the 1980s."
At Tuesday's news conference, Stern pointed out that about half the U.S. population is young enough to have never seen the encounter of an unexplored planet for the first time until now. I sure haven't, so I'm pretty jazzed about that.
[Spacecraft Dawn has arrived at Ceres, one of solar system's last unexplored planets]
Starting in July, New Horizons will furiously collect data using its seven on-board instruments. It's going to collect so much that it will take some 16 months for it to all get sent back home, extending long past the spacecraft's actual flyby.
This is definitely exciting stuff, and 2015 is shaping up to be a great year for space exploration.

The Wisdom of Bored Inquiry
Philip Dhingra Blocked Unblock Follow Aug 25, 2016
“The nitrogen in our DNA, the calcium in our teeth, the iron in our blood, the carbon in our apple pies were made in the interiors of collapsing stars. We are made of starstuff.”
―Carl Sagan, Cosmos (1980)
“There's as many atoms in a single molecule of your DNA as there are stars in the typical galaxy. We are, each of us, a little universe.”
―Neil deGrasse Tyson, Cosmos (2014)
Carl Sagan or Neil deGrasse Tyson would suggest we adopt the mindset of a child who looks at the universe in wonderment. Such a mindset leads us to stare at the night sky and dream about worlds beyond. But what isn't mentioned is that children also have an incredible capacity for boredom. They can be ferried across the Seven Wonders of the World, only to look up occasionally and apathetically from their portable video games. But is there wisdom in bored inquiry?
It's wonderment that drives the quest to zoom the lens further down to figure out what truly constitutes matter. But it's disillusionment or dispassion that has the capacity to reason that maybe there is nothing magical about existence at all. Wonderment is what drives people to look at the complexity of an organ like the eye and conjure an intelligent designer behind it. But it's a cool skeptic who sees wonderment as yet another human bias to be triumphed and asks, “What if it's all just random?”
In retrospect, it seems strange that the vast majority of history's great scientists believed in God. The great physicists, Newton and Einstein, both were believers, despite both piercing the hitherto divine veils of reality. Scientific inquiry and religious inquiry have for many millennium been linked by the same quest for knowledge. Pioneers all want to reveal His design, and yet each revelation chips away at the possibility of His existence. The faith-driven scientists have boxed faith into a corner, which may help explain why the next generation has been characterized by apathy.
But apathy, and its cousin skepticism, could potentially drive the next generation of discoveries. Metaphysics, which in a way is the negation of physics, is still an infant compared to physics. Philosophies like Wheeler's It from Bit, might finally get a proper treatment now that we're entering a world driven by computer programmers who can easily grasp the idea that the universe might be a giant abstract Turing machine. Computer science might even be the ultimate dispassionate post-modern knife as it has been cutting through every discipline with computational genetics, computational linguistics, and computational everything. We will need cool minds to dispute both the age-old fantasies of Rapture and Apocalypse, which have been re-branded as Singularity and Malthusian Catastrophe. And we will need them to also explain how, despite the lack of any magic or mystery undergirding the universe, everything is still going to be okay.
As deal-savvy gamers might have noticed by now, the Xbox Windows Phone Deal of the Week is now technically a part of Microsoft's Red Stripe Deals , which roll out every Thursday. Basically three Windows Phone apps or games go on Thor's Day, one of which will be an Xbox Live title. Well, a rose by another name smells just as sweet, and we'll continue reporting on the Xbox sale game prior to Thursday as we've always done.
Now that we've gotten that out of the way, let's talk games! The last two Xbox Deal games had both been on sale before returning to Deal of the Week status. This Thursday, a quality game goes on sale for the first time ever: Sonic CD from SEGA! Okay, technically there was that weird glitch in which Nokia gave out a non-Xbox Live version of Sonic CD for a short time last year, but that doesn't count. Sonic CD will soon be available at a discount for everybody – with sparkly Xbox Live Achievements intact.
Sonic CD is a remake of the classic 16-bit Sega CD game. It plays much like other Sega Genesis Sonic games, though the focus on exploration has increased thanks to much larger levels and new gameplay mechanics. Sonic can now travel forward and backward in time by touching special sign posts and then reaching super high speeds. Doing so takes him to unique versions of each level, with altered layouts, graphics, and music. It's a unique and fun spin on the classic series.
The story comes to life via fully animated cartoon segments at the beginning and end of the game. Sonic's nemesis Dr. Eggman has traveled back in time to change the history of the mysterious Little Planet and gain its power.
Sonic can take on the game's seven zones by simply heading for the goal posts and beating all the bosses, but that's like playing only half the game. To fully restore Little Planet and get the happy ending, the blue blur will need to travel into the past version of each zone in order to destroy Eggman's robot teleporters and holograms. Eventually he'll also do battle with fan-favorite enemy Metal Sonic.
The Windows Phone version of Sonic CD features a ton of improvements over the classic game, including true widescreen visuals, two selectable soundtracks, and the newly-playable sidekick Tails. All told, we consider this one of the very best games of 2012. Check out our full review for lots more details, and don't forget to use our exclusive Achievement Guide when you play.

As parents we want to help our kids learn, grow and be their best. However, while in the daily grind, it can feel like we're nudging and negotiating them through an obstacle course, from the time they wake up to when we put them to bed.
"Come on ...
… be responsible & get ready for school.”
... be brave & try a new food."
... be generous & share your toys."
... be confident & make some new friends"
... be patient & wait until I'm off the phone."
... be perseverant & finish piano practice."
… be helpful & get ready for bed?
On the other hand, getting our kids to engage with new technologies, games and apps is effortless (who can blame them, those things are so much fun). And when it comes to these new technologies, there's no shortage of great apps and gadgets teaching subjects like math, vocabulary and puzzle solving. However, like most parents, we're eager to encourage other capacities too. We want our children to develop character strengths, honourable qualities and virtuous behaviour.
So we thought, it would be cool to have something engaging that encouraged universal virtues like Courage, Perseverance, Confidence, Compassion and so on. Something to help kids be mindful of positive qualities that make them stronger and better equipped to overcome day-to-day challenges. We set out to use our skills in game development, software technology, new media and story telling to make a captivating product that inspires an appreciation of virtues and their potential in everyday life.
With feedback from various girls, boys and parents, we turned to the technology of augmented reality (AR) and created a 3D world of superheroes with an epic story.
The heroes live in a parallel world where each helps protect the universe with a unique virtue superpower. We call them The Virtuals™. To 'power-up' their special abilities, like Joy, Generosity, and Patience, the Virtuals must cross over to our world and team-up with kids.
To connect kids with Virtual World, we developed a special AR mobile app and three physical products that feature the Virtuals.
When kids look at our physical products with the mobile AR app, the Virtuals cross through a magic portal from their world to ours (you really gotta see it!) Through 3D AR games and stories, kids learn about different virtues and the real powers they have.
We'll use your backing finances to finalize three original Virtuals characters, each with their own Card, Decal, T-Shirt and AR games. The rewards for backing us are these very same products, which you can see outlined below.
This is our project in a nutshell. In order to make it a reality, we need to reach our funding goal with pledges from heroes like you.
With your pledge, we will also ask you for input to help us finalize, and later extend, the project.
You can help us decide things like:
- Which Virtues should we start with first?
- Should we incorporate a 'Virtues' badge feature, for parents to reward & encourage children for making an effort to develop Virtues in real life?
-Should we develop a progress 'dashboard' so parents can see, via another app, the capacities their child is learning about.
- etc.
We'll use your financial pledges to finalize three original Virtuals characters, each with their own Card, Decal, T-Shirt and AR games. The following rewards are the very same products you're helping us to complete! This is why we offer up to three items ("x3" - one for each character).
With AR technology, our mobile app uses the three physical products as visual triggers to incorporate 3D elements from 'Virtual World' into your real world environment.
When you look at a Virtuals Card, Decal or T-Shirt with our app, the Virtuals cross over to our world to engage kids with 3D stories and games that highlight virtues.
Our AR app will be available for FREE to all our Kickstarter backers, for iOS, Android and Windows devices.
Each product comes with an AR game featuring the given character and its specific virtue. As kids play with the superheroes, and learn about virtues, the Virtuals gain power-ups, unlocking more cool powers and features in the AR app.
The Virtuals Card allows kids to play with their Virtuals hero anywhere. These are durable hard plastic cards with protective coating.
With the Virtuals Decal (8"x8" wall sticker), you can decorate your wall with graphics that come to life. These are non-permanent decorations, so you can easily peel and reposition them as many times as you want.
Finally, with the Virtuals T-Shirt kids can champion the virtues they're learning about while doing some pretty unique things.
By pairing-up multiple products (for example 2 different Cards, or 1 Decal + 1 T-shirt, etc.) you unlock additional combo games with our AR app. There are tons of bonus combinations!
We have already developed and tested our prototype products and augmented reality app. With your backing we will complete our work and finalize a set of market ready products. We will develop three original Virtuals characters, each with their own Card, Wall Decal, T-shirt and augmented reality games. In addition to the prizes we offer, backers also get a chance to vote on some key points that will influence how we develop the final creations.
Funding Breakdown
Here's a breakdown on how we plan to use your backing support:
Design & Scenario Creation - $7,000
Programming & Development - $7,000
App testing & quality assurance – $3,000
Kickstarter Rewards & Fees – $7,000
Phil Davis remains unbooked despite other marquee light heavyweights taking fights over the past few months.
Davis (12-1 MMA, 8-1 UFC), who this past August racked up a big win by outpointing ex-champ Lyoto Machida (19-4 MMA, 11-4 UFC), today told MMAjunkie Radio that UFC matchmakers are waiting for a few puzzle pieces to move in the division.
But personally, he's convinced his next move is already set.
“I want to fight Glover Teixeira,” Davis said.
Why would Davis covet an opponent who's already booked? What about Teixeira's upcoming title shot against champ Jon Jones at UFC 172?
Well, Davis thinks Jones isn't going to make it.
“I don't wish him harm or wish he's injured,” Davis said. “I just have this sneaky suspicion.”
Now, why would Jones withdraw from a booking he's thrice agreed to – for UFC 169, UFC 170, and UFC 171 – only to see the UFC push back the date to April 26 in Baltimore?
“I'm just going to tell you the short version,” Davis said. “Alexander Gustafsson put tips all over that boy. [Jones] doesn't know up from down, left from right. So I really don't see him wanting to get back in there with anybody – definitely not Alexander. I don't even think he wants to get back in there with Glover Teixeira – bless his little heart.
“But look, I like [Teixeira]. He's a cool cat, but this is what we do. I'm sure he doesn't care. He's willing to mix it up with anybody, too.”
Jones (19-1 MMA, 13-1 UFC) previously said he wasn't thrilled with the UFC's repeated scheduling difficulties, but said he was ready to move forward with his career against Teixeira (22-2 MMA, 5-0 UFC), who's undefeated in the octagon and earned his title shot this past September with a knockout of Ryan Bader.
Also ready to go is Davis, who said he's not encumbered by any nagging injuries.
“Healthy as a bumble bee,” he said. “I'm ready to get in there and do what I do. But there are weird things going on right now, and I'm not sure there are a lot of guys that are ready to mix it up. I think the matchmakers are waiting for a couple of people, and when those guys become available, I'll get matched up.”
And even if his hunch is wrong, Davis said he'll fight whomever the UFC puts in front of him.
“I will gladly step in and fight Glover, and for the second time, be the No. 1 contender, and hopefully, that will earn me a title shot,” he said. “But in the meantime, I'll fight anybody. You name them, I'll fight them.”
For the latest on UFC 172, stay tuned to the UFC Rumors section of the site.

Workers World Party: The pseudo-left face of the Democratic Party

Earlier this month, a two-day event took place in Detroit under the banner of the “International People's Assembly Against the Banks and Against Austerity.” The meeting, which was attended by a little over 100 people, was organized by the Workers World Party to provide a platform for the Democratic Party.
One would be hard pressed to find a more distasteful combination of political scoundrels and charlatans than those who spoke at the October 5-6 event. They included Detroit City Councilwoman Joanne Watson and other local politicians who are complicit in the decades-long attacks led by the Democratic Party against the workers of Detroit.
Also speaking were various union bureaucrats—from the Service Employees International Union (SEIU), the Amalgamated Transit Union (ATU) and the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME)—who have made their careers selling out the working class. This included former AFSCME Local 207 President John Riehl, a “left” union bureaucrat who was voted out of office after he betrayed the 2012 strike by Detroit Water and Sewerage workers.
The Workers World web site enthusiastically reported the demagogic statements of Wayne County Commissioner Martha G. Scott, who opened the event by declaring, “We're calling on the banks to refund the money they stole from our community. Make the banks pay!”
The principal aim of the assembly was to bolster a party that is presiding, at both a local and national level, over the impoverishment of the working class on behalf of the banks. While the Workers World Party has long served as a “left” appendage of the Democrats, this event demonstrated that the organization is no longer capable of maintaining even a pretense of independence from the Democratic Party.
On the contrary, it finds its raison d'etre in basking in the reflected glory of Democratic officials. A Workers World spokesman made a point of thanking US Congressman John Conyers for his endorsement, saying it had been “key to the success of the assembly.”
The promotion of big business politicians and union bureaucrats is all the more noteworthy in that it occurs in the midst of the most concentrated assault on the working class in the country—the bankruptcy of Detroit—which is being perpetrated precisely by these forces.
The city's Democratic City Council and Democratic mayor are collaborating with the emergency manager, Kevyn Orr, himself a Democrat appointed by a Republican governor to destroy city workers' pensions, sell off public assets and restructure the city for the benefit of the financial and corporate elite.
Key to the effort to refurbish the image of the Democratic Party and block the development of a conscious political movement of the working class is the peddling of the lie that the Obama administration can be pressured into opposing the attacks by Orr and Governor Rick Snyder.
Watson suggested that the visit by Obama officials to Detroit last month was a great opportunity to get the federal government to intervene on behalf of the workers of Detroit. According to the Workers World web site, Watson “told the assembly that, rather than allow an invitation-only meeting about the city's future with the Obama administration to take place behind closed doors on September 27, ‘I showed up anyway.' When she was told there was no room for the City Council at the meeting, she protested, saying, ‘The people of Detroit should be represented here.' The assembly applauded her defense of people's rights.”
What a fraud! The Obama administration has intervened in the bankruptcy court to support the bankruptcy, filing a Justice Department brief opposing legal challenges. The administration sees Detroit as a model to gut pensions and health care benefits for public workers across the country.
For its part, the City Council has overseen the elimination of 45 percent of the city's workforce over the last decade, the gutting of fire protection, public transportation and other essential services for city residents, and the payment of hundreds of millions of dollars in interest to the Wall Street banks.
Before the installation of Orr, Council members argued that no emergency manager was needed because they were more than willing to impose the austerity measures demanded by Wall Street. In so far as some local Democrats have grievances with Orr, it is because he threatens their ability to cash in on the privatization of services and the selling off of city assets.
The Workers World Party is a pro-Stalinist organization that has long allied itself with the Democratic Party, promoting, in particular, its African American wing. After decades of collaborating with and defending the attacks by the Democrats and the union bureaucracy on the working class, the organization has been fully integrated into the corporate-controlled political establishment.
What brings all of these forces together is their fear of the emergence of a politically conscious opposition by the working class in Detroit, which would have national and international implications. Such a movement would threaten the capitalist system, which the Democratic Party, the unions, and their pseudo-left acolytes—representing more affluent layers of the middle class—defend.
The day before the “People's Assembly,” the first organized resistance to the bankruptcy in Detroit took place when hundreds of workers, youth and artists participated in the October 4 demonstration to defend the Detroit Institute of Arts organized by the Socialist Equality Party and the International Youth and Students for Social Equality.
The demonstration gave expression to the genuine opposition of the working class because it was organized on the basis of rejecting any reliance on the Democratic Party or the trade union apparatus. Instead, it championed the fight for the independent industrial and political mobilization of the working class, the rejection of all demands for the gutting of pensions and the sell-off of assets, including the artwork of the DIA, and a socialist program, including the nationalization of the banks that are looting the city.
This is the only way forward for the working class.

As a child, I never pictured the adult "me" journeying to other planets and having a fantastic time of it. Instead I pictured myself dying in a nuclear inferno. The future me was a screaming skeleton decorated with chunks of carbonised flesh and the occasional sizzling hair. Not really someone you'd have round for dinner.
Still, at least my premonition suggested I'd live an exciting life, albeit a short one. The reality is less spectacular. I never pictured myself as I was last week: a fully grown adult: alive, yet slowly losing the will to live while attempting to buy a washing machine from a high-street electrical retailer.
Let's be clear about this. Buying a washing machine is not the stuff dreams are made of. It's not a device you're going to fall in love with. It's a white box with a round mouth you shove dirty pants into. Hardly a new member of the family, unless you're a troupe of extreme performance artists.
Buying a mobile phone is easier than buying a washing machine because some phones have the decency to look ugly, thereby simplifying the decision-making process. Washing machines all look the same. Some eat bigger loads or have a more complex array of pre-wash options: whoopee doo. Some doubtless perform better than others: I wouldn't know. Bet it's all a con. Bet there's only one type of washing machine in the world, and they're all shipped from the same warehouse in slightly different packaging and sold at randomly generated prices.
I buy washing machines the same way I order wine in a restaurant: avoid the very cheapest on the basis that it'll be nasty, avoid the second cheapest on the basis that it's probably even worse, avoid the expensive options at the top of the list on the basis that they can't possibly be worth it, and wind up randomly picking something from the middle instead.
Just to make you feel even more uncertain about buying one, they don't have proper names. Once you strip the familiar manufacturer trademarks away, all you're left with is a meaningless series of model numbers chosen specifically to confuse you. Did you order a BD4437BX or a BD3389BZ? Face it: you have no idea. Ring up to place an order and it sounds as if you're discussing chemical weapon formulae. This is why buying a washing machine never feels "real". If you walk around Battersea Dogs Home, brown-eyed puppies with names such as Timbo and Ookums softly yelp for your attention. Walk around Comet and you're confronted by a wall of emotionless monoliths with incomprehensible names. And that's just the staff!!!!!??!!!!?!
I got caught in a high-street retail delivery trap recently; one of those Kafkaesque scenarios in which you pay for something on the basis that it will arrive at a certain time, only to find out it won't, and soon you're sucked into a spiral of helpline calls and telephone keypad options and complaints and counter-complaints until eventually you realise that you're both in a loveless relationship; needing each other, hating each other, revolving for hours in a weepy embrace, listlessly kicking at one another's shins.
But this time something new and modern happened. Shortly after one of our bitter rows, while waiting for them to call back, I went on Twitter (yes, bloody Twitter) and angrily compared the Currys electrical retail chain to the Nazis. The next day a mysterious message arrived with a number for me to call; this turned out to belong to one of their heads of PR, who'd spotted my outburst and tracked down my contact details. It's a bit embarrassing when you find yourself talking to someone high up in a company you've loudly and publicly likened to the Third Reich only the night before. Fortunately for me, she was polite and savvy enough not to mention it. Instead she quickly sorted out my complaint, which is the closest I've ever come to feeling like a VIP, or Michael Winner. Nice for me, annoying for anyone reading about it who hasn't been afforded that kind of treatment, ie, you. Perhaps, if I was principled, I'd have yelled "I demand to be treated as a regular customer!" and slammed the phone down. But I didn't.
Still, if buying a big boring box from a big boring shop is a harrowing experience, isn't it time retailers were honest about it? There's no point in pretending to be fun, happy-go-lucky institutions. We're British. We know the truth and we can handle it. Dixons is running a campaign describing itself as "the last place you want to go", which is meant to be a clever reference to its low prices (ie, go and look at it in Harrods, then buy it from us), but effectively describes every electrical retail chain I've ever visited.
Someone needs to go further and launch a chain called Shambles, where all the familiar shortcomings are actively promoted as part of the "experience". The staff wear ironic dunce caps and vulture costumes; if you want to actually buy something, they walk to a stockroom 10 miles away in a neighbouring county to check its availability, methodically harass you into taking out five-year cover using a subtle combination of CIA "extraordinary rendition" psychological techniques and unashamed sulking, then arrange for it to be delivered at 7am by a surly man who'll arrive 10 hours late on purpose, deliberately bring a BD4437BX instead of the BD3389BZ you ordered, attach a magic hidden "hobbling" device that causes it to malfunction immediately before the next bank holiday weekend, screw your partner, scare your kids, wreck your life, and break wind on your doorstep as he's leaving. All of which is heavily advertised as an integral part of the service.
It'll be miserable. But at least you'll enter the transaction with your eyes wide open.
The FIM (Fédération Internationale de Motorcyclisme) and Dorna have proposed to the Grand Prix Commission the introduction of ‘Factory 2' entries in the premier class of MotoGP™ to compliment the ‘Factory' and ‘Open' entries.
Javier Alonso, Managing Director of Dorna's Events Area has explained the philosophy behind the plans, which are submitted for approval by the Grand Prix Commission on 11th March.
The proposal would see Factory Honda and Yamaha bikes competing with a 20 litre fuel capacity limit, five engines sealed at the beginning of the season and without the Extra-Soft tyre. The Open entries have 24 litres of fuel, 12 non-sealed engines and a softer tyre option. There would then be an additional Factory 2 class as explained by Alonso.
“The proposal which has been made relates to Open entry manufacturers achieving podium results, specifically three third positions, two second places or one victory, in dry race conditions. They would then have certain limitations applied relating to the Open class (22.5 litres of fuel reduced from 24) and fewer engines available (the total reduced from 12 to 9),” states Alonso, Dorna Managing Director and Race Direction member.
He added, “We looked at the Sepang test results, especially the second test, and it's clear that of the two software versions used, the second developed by Magneti Marelli offers great performance. The fact is that the only manufacturer ready to use that software is Ducati. That gives them some advantage when combined with the Open rules, so we have therefore made this plan to the GP Commission, to find a balance which does not give one manufacturer too much of an advantage.”
“As a championship we aim to allow everyone to have the best possible technology, including this type of software, but from talking to the private teams they are not yet set up to be able to use this ‘full software'. Clearly Ducati were not at the same level as Honda and Yamaha last season and what they have done is to look for a way within the rules to improve their grid and race results. We understand that by making some changes they can be closer to the other constructors but we do not want them to have too much of an advantage, as it would be unfair for them to beat the rest of the manufacturers with greater ammunition. So we think the proposal on the table is a good solution.”
The Dorna Director also confirmed that the rule changes now taking place have a long term objective of creating a more level playing field in terms of technology. The goal is for all MotoGP entries to be Open by 2016.
“The ECU and software development work is being undertaken now with the objective that soon everyone uses the same ECU, like this season, and eventually the same software,” Alonso explained.
"Our duty is to ensure that the very best software is developed and that the manufacturers can make the best of it with their bikes. In fact, we are asking the factories to help us with this software development."
"We are saying to them, ‘look we have this piece of software and if you think you can improve it and we can apply it, then the only thing we're asking is that it can be used by the rest of the field.' Whenever we find that improvements can be made, we want to make them.”
When a few friends from Louisville started booking music shows at Headliners Music Hall in 2005, they had no idea they'd be pioneers in Louisville's music scene.
“We never set out to do that,” said Joe Argabrite, a now co-owner of Headliners on Lexington Road. “We set out to work hard and create a viable market, which we have and I think now people are very interested.”
Argabrite—along with Billy Hardison and John Grantz—make up the core of the Headliners crew, first by booking shows there and later than its owners. It took nearly 20 years of work to create a market and a venue that artists seek out, Argabrite said.
There were challenges along the way, but that comes with maintaining a building that dates to the early 1900s and staying afloat in a sea of other venues. Soon, though, the crew at Headliners will be facing perhaps their biggest challenge yet.
A new music venue in downtown Louisville opens in April. With a capacity of about 900, the Mercury Ballroom on Fourth Street is roughly the same size as Headliners. It's on the same block as the Palace and, like the Palace, Mercury Ballroom is backed by Live Nation Entertainment, a behemoth of a company that operates venues and sells tickets around the world.
Already, the Mercury Ballroom has booked eight acts that have played Headliners in previous years.
Billy Hardison said the emergence of Mercury Ballroom causes a bit of worry in his crew, but he also sees an opportunity.
“Worry goes with the territory,” Hardison said. “We're optimistic, but we've always got a nod to what's around the corner. It is definitely going to make us work harder at our job. I mean, competition is good.”
For years, Headliners has been the comfortable medium between small bars and clubs such as Zanzabar and larger venues such as The Louisville Palace or the Kentucky Center. (Disclaimer: Grantz also works for Louisville Public Media.) It's a popular place for fans, but it doesn't have the multibillion-dollar backing Mercury Ballroom does.
Dan Kemer, Live Nation's vice president of music in the Midwest, said a little variety and competition is good for fans and artists alike.
“There are so many different genres and so many different artists and fans in the marketplace that I think it is just the next natural development for a thriving music scene for multiple venues,” Kemer said.
Nearly 250,000 Louisville residents have signed up for a Mercury Ballroom/Live Nation newsletter, which Kemer said translates into a lot of fans looking for tickets to live music.
Hardison said he hopes that is the case—because it will be up to the fans to support the two similar venues.
“They think it's completely possible,” Hardison said. “They are a very large, successful, organized, well-informed company that probably has some analytics that we don't have that says Louisville can support that, and I sure hope they're right.”
Justin Lewis, a Louisville artist that first performed at Headliners when he was 19-years-old, said it will be difficult even for a company as big as Live Nation to threaten the prominence of Headliners.
“They are just really good at what they do,” Lewis said. “When people come to Louisville and ask about the best venue, Headliners will top the list. Local musicians thrive to play there.”
Lewis said he doesn't believe Live Nation is trying to oust Headliners—they are just jumping on an opportunity.
“I think they know that Headliners is good,” he said. “I think they just want to put their hands in the pot, which is business.”
On social media, reactions are mixed. Some support Mercury Ballroom, but some Headliner fans have threatened to boycott the new venue.
“I hate hearing people say that,” he said. “I'm not going to not support an artist because I don't want to support the venue. It's all about supporting the artist.”
Hardison doesn't support a boycott, either. He said the new venue should be able to cater to audiences that have, historically, been underserved in Louisville.
“Live Nation can take on bigger pop and hip-hop and metal and (electronic dance music),” he said. “I have a feeling they will keep their calendar as diverse as possible.”
Kemer said that Mercury Ballroom will be a good opportunity to give different genres a place to perform. He said the venue will support local artist development and has scheduled a “Mercury Rising” series highlighting local musicians such as the Tunesmiths and the Debauchees.
Both bands are Headliners regulars.
“We are looking at every genre out there,” Kremer said. “Whatever the fans are looking for, that is what we want to be. We want to be a music hall for every and all genre and every and all fan.”
Ticket prices are not projected to vary much between the two venues. Kemer said prices are dictated by artists, but he said lower ticket prices enable fans to see more shows.
“When fans are seeing more shows it is another opportunity to help build a thriving music scene in a thriving music town,” he said. “Keeping ticket prices low is one of the priorities.”
Even if the competition heats up, it'll have to stay somewhat cordial. The main core of the Headliners crew also runs Production Simple, a local promotion company that brings in many of the acts to Headliners. Production Simple already has a relationship with Live Nation to book acts at the Palace.
“We love working with Billy and the guys over at Production Simple,” Kemer said. “We do a lot of work together and coexisting and we're talking about another show in April over at the Palace. We love working with those guys and we want to continue to do that.”
But when asked if that relationship will extend to Headliners, the answer wasn't as clear. The opening act for Mercury Ballroom will be Okkervil River on April 4. They last came to Louisville in 2005, performing at Uncle Pleasant's.
And Headliners' Argabrite was certain Okkervil River's next show in the city would be at Headliners.
“I have had an ongoing relationship with Okkervil's agent,” Argabrite said. “We've worked together on a lot of other things. It was my understanding that I would be given a shot at the date. They went to Mercury instead. It's just the difference between history and money.”
For a list of upcoming shows at the venues, go here for Mercury Ballroom and go here for Headliners Music Hall.
Affordable houses may soon be exempt from stamp duty, which varies between 4% and 8% of the transaction value.Union minister for urban development and housing Venkaiah Naidu said that his ministry has written to state governments to exempt affordable houses from stamp duty. Stamp duty is a state subject, with the state government fixing the rate and collecting the duty.Addressing Credai, the Confederation of Real Estate Developers' Associations of India, the minister said that the Centre would ensure that there was no net tax escalation in the housing sector, particularly the affordable housing segment, following the implementation of the goods and services tax ( GST ).He said that the inclusion of the real estate sector in the GST framework would help the industry.Affordable housing is exempt from service tax, which is around 5.35% of a property's selling price. He said his ministry had already taken up with the finance ministry the need to continue the exemption under GST. He added that his ministry had also recommended to the finance ministry that the sector be taxed at a rate which is revenue neutral, and not a higher one.The minister expressed his helplessness vis-a-vis the exclusion of stamp duty from GST, saying, “States have, in their wisdom, not adhered to the inclusion of stamp duty under GST.” “Thus, we need to move forward from this debate,” he said.
Russia will be able to start producing Italian cheese, fish, oil, sugar and other food products
Italy will help Russia's food import substitution problem, however paradoxical this sounds. This year the two countries will start common agricultural projects that the Russian Ministry of agriculture suggest to its Italian colleagues.
We're talking about building agricultural complexes, lines of food products including cheese, logistics and distribution projects to be implemented with Italian investment and technology. As Italian Deputy Minister of Agriculture Giuseppe Castiglione said to Izvestia, the projects will start in October.
The Russian Ministry of Agriculture offered the Italian Agricultural Ministry 29 investment projects in nine Russian regions: (the Bashkortostan Republic, Kabardino-Balkaria, the Krasnodar, Belgorod, Voronezh, Kostroma, Moscow, Orenburg and Tambov regions). Italy began to develop its own proposals that will be presented soon. Under the sanctions and embargo on food that cost Italian agricultural producers about €900 million, they can export investments and technology.
Izvestia got a look at projects in many areas. According to a source close to the government, with the help of Italy, Russia hopes to set up production lines of Gorgonzola and ricotta cheese as well as turkey feed, trout farms, vegetables and fruit.
Deputy Italian Minister of Agriculture, Giuseppe Castiglione said that Italy is very interested in these projects, and plans to present its vision at the St. Petersburg International Economic Forum in June. There will be another meeting in October when implementation will begin. Italy will provide an unspecified level of investment.
If you've seen technology news lately, you've likely noticed that Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have skyrocketed in price. In just 2017 alone, Bitcoin has seen a 2035.3% increase in price at the time of this writing. And, because many coins in the cryptocurrency market are highly correlated with Bitcoin, currencies such as Ethereum and Litecoin have seen equally spectacular jumps in price. Ethereum, for example, has seen a 6365.3% increase and Litecoin a 2775.49% increase.
We know that Bitcoin is the king of crypto as of today, but its primary use at the moment is solely that of a currency. This is great for day-to-day payments, but we want more functionality; we want the ability to write software that will run ontop of a large, decentralized network like Bitcoin's. To do this, we could create Bitcoin smart contracts, but Bitcoin's smart contract language is limited and not very extensible.
To get our smart contracts running on a vast decentralized network, we'll create smart contracts for the Ethereum blockchain. Ethereum is special, because it's the first blockchain implementation to have a Turing Complete virtual machine built ontop of it. This means that an Ethereum smart contract can (theoretically) be used to accomplish any computational task. In simpler terms, nearly any program can be run on of Ethereum.
In this post, we'll walk through making a simple counter smart contract. The contract will be written in a programming language called Solidity, a language similar to JavaScript. Before we get started, you must have Ganache installed, which will be the tool we'll use to create a private blockchain that runs on our machine only. You'll also need to download your own copy of MyEtherWallet (the URL-hosted website won't work in this case). Note: Download etherwallet-v3.xx.x.x.zip.
Once those are installed, we'll get started by going to https://remix.ethereum.org/ in our browser, where we'll see the following screen.
Remix IDE
This is Remix, an online compiler for Solidity. It's what we'll use to write our smart contract code. When you first visit the page, the text editor is preloaded with some code. But, we don't need what's given, so we'll erase all of that text and replace it with the following.
Counter Code (in Solidity)
This is the code for our counter. As you can see, it has one variable and three functions. The variable, count , is an integer that's private, which means that it can't be accessed by anyone outside of the contract itself. The first function, incrementCounter() , changes, or mutates, the value of count by incrementing its value. The second function, decrementCounter() , mutates the value of count by decrementing its value. And, the third function, getCount() , accesses count and returns its value to whoever or whatever called the function.
When the counter code is pasted into Remix, it should look like the following and automatically compile.
Remix with Contract Code
We'll leave that tab open so that we can return to it later. Now, open Ganache and you'll see something like this.
Near the top of the screen, you can see text that says “RPC SERVER”. We'll need it soon.
Now, unzip your MyEtherWallet download and open the folder. Then, open the index.html file in your browser to see the following screen.
In the top right corner, you can see a dropdown that tells MyEtherWallet what Ethereum network to connect to. By default, it connects to the Ethereum (ETH) main network (mainnet). We want to change this by clicking the dropdown.
Click “Add Custom Node”.
Now you can input the RPC Server information that Ganache gave us earlier. Note: You can name your node whatever you'd like.
MyEtherWallet is now connected to your self-hosted blockchain through Ganache. Let's use MyEtherWallet to upload our Counter smart contract to our blockchain. To do this, we'll click “Contracts” in MyEtherWallet's top navigation bar and select “Deploy Contract”.
As you can see, MyEtherWallet asks us for the contract's byte code. To locate this, we'll go back to our Remix IDE and click the “Details” button.
You should now see a dialog with a lot of information about our Counter contract.
To copy the byte code, we'll click the clipboard icon next to “BYTECODE”.
Then, we'll go back to MyEtherWallet and paste the byte code into the dialog.
Now we can scroll down and import an account to upload the contract with. Luckily, Ganache gave us 5 addresses that we can use to interact with our private blockchain. To use one of them to upload this contract, we can go back to Ganache and click the key icon for any of the addresses.
It'll show us the private key associated with this account.
This money is fake, so I'm comfortable showing the private key, but always be careful!
We can copy this private key and paste it into MyEtherWallet.
Now if we click “Unlock”, MyEtherWallet will ask us if we want to sign this transaction and deploy our contract. We do.
Click Yes!
If the transaction occurred successfully, then Ganache will increment its “Current Block” value and the transaction count of the account that we used to deploy the contract also increment.
Our contract is now uploaded to our blockchain! To interact with it by incrementing and decrementing the counter, we can go back to MyEtherWallet and select “Interact With Contract”.
MyEtherWallet now asks for the address at which our newly deployed contract resides and the Application Binary Interface (ABI) of our contract. To find the contract address, we can go back to Ganache and view our transactions log.
This page shows us the transaction that we'd created earlier when we deployed our contract. As you can see, Ganache tells us the address we'd used to deploy the contract, the address of the contract on our blockchain, and more information about the transaction. Let's click the transaction, copy the created contract address, and paste it into MyEtherWallet.
All that's left that we need is the ABI. This is what tells MyEtherWallet how to interact with our contract. To get it, we'll go back to Remix and click the clipboard icon next to “INTERFACE - ABI” to copy it.
Now we can go back to MyEtherWallet, paste the ABI into its text box, and click the “Access” button.
Awesome! Now we can interact with our contract by clicking the “Select a function” dropdown.
In our code, we set count ‘s initial value to 0. To confirm that the contract is working properly, let's call the getCount() function.
It worked! Our contract returned 0 when getting the value of count before changing it. But, we also made two other functions, incrementCounter() and decrementCounter() . Let's call incrementCounter() to test it. We'll do this by selecting the function dropdown again, selecting incrementCounter , and creating a new transaction.
This just incremented the value of count . Now we can call getCount() again to confirm whether the value actually changed.

On May 28 an impromptu occupation began in Istanbul's central Gezi Park following the news that the metropolitan municipality had sent bulldozers to demolish the park. The park was doomed as it sits on the pathway of a new urban restructuring programme which included the transformation of the green zone into another superfluous shopping complex.
Largely ignored by the outlets of the corporate press, the news travelled quickly on social media, followed by the appearance of a number of protesters at the scene. Four days since the initial mobilisation, Gezi Park has witnessed a continuous influx of protestors who have organised sit-ins and public talks in a largely carnivalesque atmosphere. On May 30, Al Jazeera reported that ‘unconfirmed reports suggest more than 10,000 people are currently gathered in Taksim's Gezi Park'. But the increasing number of bodies gathered at the location could not make a dent in the AKP government's commitment to ‘urban renewal'. On the contrary, the government responded to this unexpected public resistance by repeating a time-honoured act of histrionics in Turkish politics: ignore the public, if that does not work, terrorise them.
In four days, Turkish police appeared twice with their familiar marching orders and their valiant donning of ‘riot gear' against the seemingly ‘dangerous' crowd occupying the park. Hundreds had to flee the relentless bombardment of tear gases, leaving their tents behind, only to see them destroyed by police. A student denounced the disproportionate state response in resignation: ‘Gas, gas, gas, it is the only way they deal with problems.' But for Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, there was not even a concrete problem to be addressed. Speaking at the initiation of another controversial construction project - the third bridge over the Bosphorus Strait, which Erdoğan himself regarded as ‘murder' back in 1995 - the PM retorted with his usual machismo and imperious demeanor:
The decision has been made and we will proceed accordingly. You cannot do anything about it. If you [protestors] are concerned with history that much, go and read the actual history of Gezi Park. We will revive history [and] we are doing this for our people.

Besides Erdoğan's problematic reference to the Ottoman past, the AKP government attempted to shift the terrain of discussion to the relatively ‘safe' zone of environmental politics. Erdoğan expertly recounted the number of trees the government has planted during his term (2.5 billion apparently) and Forestry and Waterworks Minister Veysel Eroğlu promised that they will plant ‘a hundred times more trees than are cut' in Gezi Park. The protection of Gezi Park as ‘one of the few remaining green spots in downtown Istanbul' is essential, but the meteoric rise of the occupation and the subsequent public outrage against the government signifies discontent with a broader trend that underpins the AKP's reign since 2002: authoritarian neoliberalism.
The AKP's rise to power was partially a result of its successful capitalisation on the failures of the previous coalitions and its entry to the political scene was marked with the explicit promise of pursuing the EU accession process. The determining factor in its political trajectory, however, has been its commitment to a full-blown neoliberal economic policy shaped around privatisations and trade liberalisations. Short-term effects of neoliberalisation have materialised in the decrease of the poverty trend by national standards (constant decrease from 2003 to 2006), fluctuations in the Gini index (2002: 42.7; 2005: 42.6; 2007: 39.3; 2008: 39) and a slight improvement in the country inequality trend. By 2011, Turkey had become the eighteenth largest economy (measured by nominal GDP) after a disastrous financial crisis in 2001.
This delusory success story has conjointly reinforced a misplaced faith in free market dogmatism despite the fact that the social indicators of development - such as the number of people living below the national poverty line - took a downturn after 2008. While neoliberal policies have become part and parcel of Turkish economic administration since the 1980s, the AKP amplified the existing drive to an unprecedented extent. The implementation of $380 million of annual privatisation before 2003 has skyrocketed to a staggering $6 billion during Erdoğan's three terms in office. Almost every remnant of the developmental state - from bridges to the tobacco monopoly (TEKEL), power stations to the state-owned banks - have been privatised or listed for auction. While the sweeping reforms have engendered wide-spread resistance including the long-fought struggles of TEKEL workers and grassroots coalitions against the construction of the Hydroelectric Power Plants (HES), the government has single-mindedly maintained its neoliberal onslaught on services, communities and the environment.
Emerging triumphant one more time at the 2011 elections, AKP neoliberalism took a more ferocious and disciplinarian form. The increasing authoritarianism of the government has manifested itself in the record number of arrests made against students, activists and lawyers in the last decade. A report released by the Solidarity with Arrested Students Platform reveals that 771 students are currently in prison, facing charges compiled under the arbitrary use of terrorism laws, laws which were originally drafted to prosecute members of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK). While criminal cases are predominantly based on the charge of ‘propagandising for an illegal organisation', some of the arrested students have been jailed for activities that include carrying a ‘free education' banner or simply wearing a poşu scarf. Despite endorsing statements from the academic community that ‘Turkey seems to have liquidated a very large part of the semi-authoritarian legacy', the legal frameworks themselves are reconstituted and utilised in a manner to suppress dissent:
This legal framework makes no distinction between an armed PKK combatant and a civilian demonstrator. In fact, demonstrators may be punished more harshly, because while combatants who turn themselves in may receive partial amnesty under the ‘Effective Repentance' provision in the Turkish Penal Code, there is no such provision to reduce the sentences of peaceful demonstrators who have never taken up arms. As a result, peaceful demonstrators with no clear PKK affiliation may be punished more harshly than PKK members who have actually served as guerrilla fighters (Human Rights Watch). Promised constitutional and other legal reforms did not occur. Instead, the right to freedom of expression was threatened and protesters faced increased police violence. Thousands of prosecutions brought under flawed anti-terrorism laws routinely failed fair trial standards (Amnesty International).
Simultaneously, privatisation and the closure of public spaces continues as an increasing number of symbolic venues have become targets of the new construction boom. Istanbul's world-renowned Emek theatre was closed down in a showdown, Karaköy, Tophane and Salıpazarı coastal lines have been restricted to public access as part of a $702 million auction and Erdoğan's ostentatious ‘crazy project' Canal Istanbul is destined to engender catastrophic consequences for the city's already debilitated ecological balance - notwithstanding the projected $350 billion investment market it will create.
The planned urban restructuring of Taksim and the destruction of Gezi Park has to be understood in the context of state-driven privatisation projects which fulfill the double enactment of surplus absorption and the closure of public spaces. This is not a mere transplantation of the Occupy Wall Street/LSX into the overstrained anatomy of Turkish politics. The organisational parallels end at the question of confronting state power. The protesters converged at Gezi Park know that the AKP will continue the neoliberalisation of urban and economic space unless it is challenged by a strong, coordinated grassroots mobilisation. The Gezi Park occupation can succeed where the TEKEL resistance faltered in 2010 - by igniting a spark that can generalise the struggle against the AKP's authoritarian neoliberalism.

His attorney told him he could be out of jail in ten days if he took the plea deal — but 58-year-old Gilbert Cruz refused, saying he wasn't going to plead guilty to something he didn't do.
He had just been booked on charges of interfering with the duties of a public servant, after a former neighbor, whom Cruz says was recently homeless, called the police on him when Cruz told her he wouldn't allow her to stay with him. Then she accused Cruz of beating her.
The arrest that would lead to more than two months in Harris County Jail and cause Cruz to lose his job and his car and almost his home, however, had nothing to do with assault — an accusation police and prosecutors agreed did not withstand scrutiny.
Continue Reading
On May 14, after a Harris County sheriff's deputy arrived at Cruz's northwest Houston apartment, he asked Cruz to leave the apartment so he could interview the woman alone. Cruz, explaining that the woman did not live there, said he did not feel comfortable leaving his own home, and he asked the deputy to interview the woman outside instead — an idea that apparently did not sit well with the officer. When Cruz would not leave, Deputy R. Delgado forcibly removed him — then punched him in the face. Delgado cuffed him, and backup showed up to haul Cruz off to jail for interfering with the investigation.
Despite the woman's claims that Cruz hit her in the face and threw her on the coffee table, Cruz was cleared of any wrongdoing: According to the deputy's offense report, the woman had not a mark to show for it, and everything on the table, including a chess set, was neatly in order. In his report, the deputy mentions he punched Cruz to “get control of the scene.”
“I thought once a judge saw me, and especially after seeing my eye, she would think, What was the reason for all that?” Cruz said. “I did not hurt that [officer] — I did nothing to him. When he punched me, I did not look at him as a police officer anymore. I looked at him as a thug.”
Even though Cruz spent more than two months in jail before prosecutors dismissed the interference case against him for lack of evidence, Cruz would see a judge only one time. He would not even be present at his own bail hearing, where defendants are — in theory — constitutionally guaranteed the right to tell a magistrate they can't afford that bail amount or to ask for a personal bond. Unable to pay the $3,500 bail, Cruz waited in jail, and was actually quarantined in his pod with more than 20 others for the better of two months after one of them contracted shingles. Cruz could not leave to go to the rec room, the library, the chapel, not even to court, trusting that his court-appointed defense attorney would handle it.
Nine weeks later, he would find that his Infiniti car had been repossessed, that he owed $15,000 to the company that auctioned off the car because it sold undervalue, that the apartment management was threatening to evict him and he owed $954 in late fees, and that his job as a contractor with the U.S. Census Bureau was gone.
“When I'm accused of doing something wrong, they hit me in my pocket," Cruz said. "I feel the same thing should be done to them."
As countless attorneys and criminal justice advocates have told the Houston Press in the past, few people have the resolve to withstand months in as bleak and dangerous a setting as jail, away from their families and jobs and lives, to fight a conviction — even if they believe they are innocent. It's a big part of the reason the Harris County District Attorney's Office is sitting on nearly 300 wrongful drug convictions dating back to 2004: Innocent people, itching to get out of jail, pleaded guilty before the lab results that proved their innocence could be processed.
"On the misdemeanor side, people often feel a lot of pressure to plead," Amalia Beckner, a public defender, told us last week. "A lot of times, people can't afford to fight their cases because if they stay in jail they'll lose their homes, they'll lose their jobs, they'll lose their support system, which is often already somewhat tenuous. So it's difficult to watch when you realize we're keeping people just because their lack of ability to pay a few hundred dollars."
Cruz's case, however, also presented additional problems: For one, why was he never afforded a bail hearing, which, as Texas Criminal Justice Coalition attorney Jay Jenkins said, is supposed to be a constitutional right. Apparently, this happens to people every day, according to DA's office spokesman Jeff McShan. Here is how he explained it:
“The Houston Press wants to rag on the DA's office and the criminal justice system, but this is actually good: For example, if you're arrested in Dallas on a Friday afternoon, your first court appearance is not until Monday. Here, it goes pretty freaking fast. Sometimes, though, it's too fast. It doesn't happen very often, but three or four times a day, there's a person who's still being booked and processing takes a while, or he went to the jail medical clinic, and his time came up for probable cause court. But [even if he was present at the hearing] they can't talk anyway. When they go in there and stand in front of a judge, they don't talk.”
Yes, even if the defendant was afforded his right to this bail hearing, it is highly unlikely in Harris County that he or she would be given the chance to ask for a lower bail or a personal bond anyway, which is why a group called Equal Justice Under The Law has filed a lawsuit against Harris County.
The group, which has filed 17 such lawsuits across the country and won eight times and so far lost none, argues that Harris County magistrates at these hearings violate the constitution by failing to consider each defendant's ability to pay bail. Instead, magistrates set bail according to a convenient bail schedule —apparently, whether or not the defendant is even present. And even if Harris County Pretrial Services recommends someone for a personal bond, according to Pretrial Services' 2014 report, magistrates ignore that recommendation 64 percent of the time for people charged with misdemeanors and 98 percent of the time for those charged with felonies, keeping roughly 15,000 people behind bars when Pretrial Services thought they were better suited to go home to their families.
Perhaps they, too, lost their jobs, cars and homes.
Gilbert Cruz said he does not want an apology from the Harris County sheriff's deputy who punched him in the face and arrested him. He said he does not want an apology from his court-appointed defense attorney, Abel Izaguirre, for failing to put more pressure on prosecutors to drop the case sooner. And he does not want an apology from anyone on the outside world who stripped him of his livelihood.
Cruz wants to win a civil lawsuit against the county so he can be repaid for everything he has lost, and he wants his arrest expunged from his record so that he can go on with his life.
Jump to Recipe Today, I am so pleased to share with you, Megan from The Vegan Cookbook Aficionado ! Megan's blog posts are super inventive, always colorful and definitely hilarious. She is so relatable in that she is honest, fun and easy to “listen” to, or read in this case. I feel like if we had a chance to hang out, things would get really awesome. Without further ado, here's her beautiful recipe for Deconstructed Falafel Bowl!
Jump to Recipe
When Jackie asked me if I wanted to do a guest post on her blog, I was most definitely stoked! I mean come on! Who could turn down a super rad lady like Jackie, the girls got talent, charisma and some serious photography skills. Not to mention she's pretty darn funny to boot, but you all knew that already now didn't ya 😉 When she asked if I could whip up something healthy for the post, I immediately said “sure! Not a problem!” which was immediately followed by a long “Ahhhhh….hmmmm….nope, I've got nothing.”
You see, I'm all over the sweets and breakfast department, but when it comes to healthy meals, I have more of a cling to my cookbooks mentality. I'll either throw together the most random salad you can imagine (what's this random vegetable in my fridge? Who cares, put it in!), or I'll pluck a book off my shelf and pick out a tasty sounding recipe. I'll be the first to admit, I'm not the most creative in the healthy weekday meal department.
It's funny, I usually have so many recipe ideas bouncing around my head at any given time, but the second I have to actually pick one, they all pull a Houdini and all that remains is a big puff of smoke in an empty room. I was starting to think my cooking mojo had all but left me, until I was out with Mr. Muggins and he asked the magical words “you wanna get a falafel?”*. Just like that, it came to me, falafel bowl! Which, due to laziness immediately turned into a deconstructed falafel bowl! Who has time to make falafel anyway, amiright?
The first and most important step to making a deconstructed falafel bowl is the deconstructed falafel. I decided to get all fancy on ya and cook some chickpeas from scratch, I know most of you are probably reading this and going, since when is cooking chickpeas fancy? And the answer to that is, since a girl who only ever buys canned chickpeas decided to make them!
I can't believe I never do this, cooked chickpeas obviously take more time, but they're so easy and way tastier, consider me a convert. If you're feeling less fancy, you can of course use the canned ones. Once my chickpeas were ready to go, I coated them in all those delicious falafel spices and roasted them in the oven until they were nice and crispy. Oh my, oh my my my, these things were hard to stop snacking on, but try to restrain yourself unless you want a falafel-less bowl.
When it came to the falafel fixins, I did what any logical blogger would do and called on my Facebook friends to find out what their favorite falafel ingredients were. The shared consensus was that lettuce, pickled turnip, tomato, cucumber and hummus were a must. Into the bowl they went, along with a little extra of the pickled turnip because that stuff is straight up tasty in my books.
Next up, I decided to go with a somewhat traditional tabbouleh salad. I used this recipe and just decreased the oil and salt, which was pretty yummy but took a long time to make, so to go a quicker route, any of your favorite grains will do. I like the idea of sprucing up a bit of buckwheat, quinoa or couscous with some lemon juice and fresh herbs. Smack dab in the center I put a big dollop of homemade hummus, you can of course use store-bought hummus, but it's pretty much a necessity for me to have a big tub of hummus in my fridge at all times and homemade is how I roll. I'm pretty sure that if at any given moment there was no hummus in my fridge my head would most likely explode, honest, vegans just can't exist without hummus, it's a scientific fact, I read it on the internet.
The only way to top off a falafel bowl is with a whole bunch of tahini and hot sauce. Ok, maybe not a whole bunch of hot sauce, unless you're into that burning all your taste buds off feeling. I like a little squeeze of the red stuff, just don't make the same mistake I did and squeeze the bottle, wonder why nothing's coming out, and squeeze harder. Yeah, not my finest moment and trying to scrape all the hot sauce off my food so that I can make it edible again is not my most favorite pastime. So there you have it, a healthy, easy, delicious bowl of falafel goodness, hmmm, maybe I'm not so bad at this healthy meal thing after all 😉
*we actually ended up getting pizza, couldn't leave ya all with that cliff hanger 😛

But at the end of a long day of work or taking care of the family, schlepping around a Winnie the Pooh bag and suppressing every profanity-laced thought, when parents find their little angels still bouncing with energy, most of them are thinking one thing: “Go the F*** to Sleep.”
Well, author Adam Mansbach finally said it out loud in his new book aptly titled, “Go the F*** to Sleep.”As if a bubble of relief popped on PayPal, the book shot to No. 1 on Amazon — before it was even released.
You could practically hear the collective, “Yeeeeeeeees!” from parents across the country, followed by, “Click — Buy It Now!”
The book won't be released until next week, but its No. 1 status has been attributed to the fact that a PDF of the book in its entirety was leaked on the Internet, delivering a simultaneous win for paid and free content on the Internet. Hello, winning!
Here's an excerpt:
“The cats nestle close to their kittens.
The lambs have laid down with the sheep.
You're cozy and warm in your bed, my dear
Please go the f@#k to sleep.”
Of course, the book is meant to be a bedtime story for grown-ups, not the kids. But since we're getting everything out in the open, might we also recommend: “That's Not Your Mommy Anymore: A Zombie Tale,” and “All My Friends Are Dead,”the heartwarming true story of what happens to dinosaurs, pirates, houseplants — and the lone survivor sock from the laundry.
And, here's one to keep in your back pocket in case you absolutely must play that card, “Monsters Eat Whiny Children.”
Isn't reading fun?
While we're blowing off some steam, let us not forget, "The Mom Song." Sing it with me:
I would consider this the real artbook compared to 'Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice: The Art of the Film' which is more like a making-of book.Tech Manual is also sort of like a making-of book except that it focuses on all the props that you see in the movie.So is this an artbook or making-of book? Well, the thing is, you won't see a lot of conceptual stuff, like those hand drawn art or sketches. What's included in the book are mostly the finalised designs. There are schematics, 3D renders, and photos of the props.Highlight of the book is you get to see lots of photos and designs from different angles from close and far. There's also a generous amount of text talking about how they are made and used in the film.The props included are divided into main sections, namely Batsuit, Armory, Vehicles, Batcave, Superman and Wonder Woman. Within in section, several pages are devoted to covering each prop, or in the case of Batsuit, you can read about the body armor, cowl, cape, utility belt, gauntlets, mech suit and the Knightmare Batman. You can also check out the extensive set of accessories from Batman, such as the Batarangs, grappling gun, guns, sticky bombs, and other tech.More emphasis goes to the Batwing and Batmobile. There are like 20 pages for each one. You get to see the vehicles from different angles, the schematics and also behind-the-scenes photos of the actual prop that was built.The section for Batcave is not as much. It focuses on the interior and the props seen in the cave. The section for Superman and Wonder Woman is also not much, but it does cover the costume design and for Wonder Woman, her different swords, shield and the rope.So overall, there's a lot on Batman and his toys.This is not like other artbooks with beautiful paintings. There's not even a single one. The focus is more on showing you the props and how they were made. To me, this book is more enjoyable than the other book which has too many film stills. I can recommend this easily to fans of the film.
Nearly a year ago, Image Space Incorporated released the Dallara DW12 for rFactor 2, allowing us to race the latest incarnation of the popular open-wheel series. It featured two real life liveries, but the rest were blatant knock-offs of the real drivers: while it may be the most epic name in history, I don't think many people will be fooled by “Max Thrust” (I'm looking at you too, Scott Dishin!). Many people have asked for a real world skin pack to be made by the community, and now we have one!
This new pack features the liveries used in the 2014 IndyCar season, as well as the 2014 Indy 500 special schemes. The paint schemes were made by boxer and Michael Peters (who was also behind a lot of IndyCar content for rFactor, and some of the upcoming Indy content for rF2!). There are also talent files, so you can be able to race against (somewhat) accurate representations of the real life drivers. The paint schemes are done to a very high quality, and they look great! I'm looking forward to giving this a spin in the near future.
Have you tried out the new paint schemes for the DW12 in rFactor 2? What are your thoughts? Let us know in the comments!
Farm equipment leasing options are available for different types of equipment. Leasing provides many benefits including tax incentives.
Reviewing and Evaluating Farm Equipment Leasing Options
To operate a farm efficiently and effectively, you will need to know what types of equipment is needed to complete all of the associated activities. The type of equipment that's used can be quite expensive to purchase so it is important to review all other available alternatives that can assist with reducing the cost. One of the most common involves choosing a farm leasing equipment option since it will not only save you money, but also has a diversity of other benefits attached to this choice.
Farm Equipment Leasing Options and Seasoned Farmers
If you are a seasoned farm owner or a novice, one of the first things that you will need to do is evaluate your present and future equipment needs. Since there is normally a long list of farming equipment required to operate a farm efficiently, you may need to start with the basics or you may choose to upgrade the equipment that you already have.
Whatever the situation, this decision is based on your financial status and the kind of experience you have in running your farm. For instance, if you have been in the farm business for a couple years or more, you may want to expand the crops that you are growing by planting a different kind of fruit or vegetable.
In order to accomplish these additional responsibilities, you may consider buying another tractor or two to plough the ground. Though the profits from this expansion will more than pay for itself within in a short period of time, you may not be able to afford the expense of making this type of purchase. So, there is another option that you can use and that is to consider farm equipment leasing alternatives as a viable option.
Most farmers already know what they need in order to operate a farm properly. However, because there have been changes in the technology and the industry, you should make sure that you are aware of the latest features and designs. The types innovative equipment needed to operate a farm are listed below along with a brief description of each.
Tractor
When starting a farm, one of the primary pieces of equipment needed is the tractor. Therefore, you will need this type of equipment for a diversity of functions. Presently, there are at least two types and they two-wheel drive and four-wheel drive.
Plow
In addition to the tractor, you will also need a plow to begin the process. This equipment is used to break up the ground, which is the first major step in the process. Typically, the plow is designed to turn over the soil, which in turns kills all of the weeds. Chisel plows, disc plows and moldboard plows are all choices that you will have available to you.

Seeders
A seeder is equipment that can be used to start the planting in the ground. So, you may want to choose a simple seeder or a huge seeder. There are many different types available to make a selection from and they include the air seeder, planters, box drill seeder and the broadcast seeder. The most popular type is known as the broadcast seeder and you may want to use them for residential instead of commercial areas. The most common seeder type you will see is a broadcast seeder.
Fertilizer spreader
Everyone who knows anything about farming can describe what fertilizer is for. To get the crop to grow quickly, you will need a fertilizer spreader to make these jobs go much smoother. Broadcast spreader is some of the most common type, though it can be used interchangeably with other types of seeder equipment. The type that is used depends on the fertilizer, since some fertilizers are liquid and others are solid.
Equipment leasing and Purchasing Farm Equipment
If you do not have the finances available to purchase the farm equipment that you need, you may want to consider farm equipment leasing as your better option. By leasing this equipment, you can pay an amount each month that you can afford. You do not have to financially cater to maintenance requirements plus the real savings in cost are normally attributed to being able to take advantage of tax breaks.

The Internal Revenue Service seized $107,702 in company profits from Lyndon McLellan just because agents didn't like the size of the convenience store owner's bank deposits. If a bipartisan proposal before Congress had been the law of the land, though, the IRS could not have justified the money grab.
Countless Americans like McLellan, who never intended to commit a crime, will avoid his heartache—and that of thousands of others—if Congress acts to curb the ability of law enforcement agencies to seize individuals' money and property without even filing a charge.
“I'm no politician, but I hope people say they need to change this,” McLellan, a North Carolina resident, said in an interview with The Daily Signal, referring to how the IRS was able to empty his bank account.
Changing that is the intent of lawmakers who propose to reform the process known in legal circles as civil asset forfeiture.
“Unjust seizures like Lyndon McLellan experienced are exactly why Congress needs to pass the FAIR Act,” @RepWalberg says.
Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., early this year teamed with Rep. Tim Walberg, R-Mich., to introduce companion bills to severely curtail the practice by the IRS and other federal agencies. Bills from others also are in the offing.
In recent days, The Daily Signal has recounted the stories of four Americans—McLellan, Massachusetts motel owner Russ Caswell, and North Carolina business owners Tom and Marla Bednar—who were startled to learn that federal officials had drained their bank accounts.
Hundreds of readers reacted with disbelief and anger.
“Whoever ordered the money to be taken needs to be prosecuted for armed robbery,” Daily Signal reader Harold Logan commented on the McLellan case, adding that “stealing money and then giving it back doesn't nullify the crime.”
“Again? Why do we have to live in fear of our own government?” reader Shaun Capaldo commented on the Bednar case. “Why do small business owners have to constantly look over their shoulders? … Please, can we just get some common sense in our leadership?”
Building a Coalition for Reform
Unless Congress acts, authorities can continue to confiscate large amounts of cash from unsuspecting citizens such as a young man from Michigan who was relieved of $16,000 in April by Drug Enforcement Agency agents who boarded the train he was taking to Los Angeles to start a business.
>>> IRS Seized $107,000 From This North Carolina Man's Bank Account
Leading the charge for reform is the Institute for Justice, a nonprofit, public interest law firm founded in 1991 and headquartered in Arlington, Va.
The institute has helped organize a coalition of two dozen groups ranging from the American Civil Liberties Union on the left to the American Conservative Union Foundation on the right. Most recently the National Federation of Independent Business, which represents small business owners, joined the reformers.
An NFIB survey found that an eye-popping 92 percent of small business owners said clear and convincing evidence of a crime should be presented before authorities can seize assets.
“People can't believe that this is going on,” @IJ's Darpana Sheth says.
“They agree that civil forfeiture has become one of the greatest threats not only to our property rights but to due process and basic fairness,” Darpana Sheth, the lawyer in charge of the Institute for Justice's initiative on the issue, told The Daily Signal.
“People can't believe that this is going on,” she said. “So there really is a lot of support [for reform] from these kinds of organizations and from the public at large.”
A poll of likely voters last fall by Rasmussen Reports found that 70 percent said a criminal conviction should be necessary before authorities can seize property. Another 13 percent disagreed and 17 percent weren't certain.
The same survey found Americans split on the motivation of law enforcement agencies, with 38 percent saying that it's more likely they seize property to ensure public safety and 42 percent saying it's a major revenue source. Another 20 percent were undecided.
Most recently, the chairmen of the House and Senate Judiciary Committees have indicated they too will introduce bills to curtail government seizures of cash and property.
Non-profit advocacy groups such as the Institute for Justice, however, see the Paul-Walberg legislation—called the Fifth Amendment Integrity Restoration Act, or FAIR Act—as the model for what needs to be done.
>>> Government to Return $107,702 Seized From Convenience Store Owner
“Unjust seizures like Lyndon McLellan experienced are exactly why Congress needs to pass the Fifth Amendment Integrity Restoration Act,” Walberg told The Daily Signal in an email, adding:
As stunning stories of abuse pop up around the country, it adds to the growing sense of urgency that legislative action is necessary to protect the American people's due process and private property rights. Thankfully, lawmakers and organizations across the ideological spectrum recognize this and have joined forces.
Ending the Profit Incentive
Civil asset forfeiture is a tool that allows law enforcement to seize cash and property suspected of being related to a crime. The practice began decades ago to go after money launderers and drug dealers, but has become a way to pad law enforcement budgets.
Authorities have made more than 55,000 seizures of cash and property worth $3 billion since 2008 under the federal Equitable Sharing Program that allows state and local agencies to take the bulk of the proceeds.
The Paul-Walberg legislation would end the profit incentive for law enforcement agencies in seizing cash, cars, houses and other property by:
Prohibiting the Justice Department and other federal agencies from retaining any assets they obtain through forfeiture.
Abolishing the department's Equitable Sharing Program, under which a local or state agency may keep up to 80 percent of proceeds after referring cases to federal officials.
The legislation also would increase the burden of proof on government to show property is subject to seizure by requiring “clear and consistent evidence,” the highest standard in civil proceedings, rather than the current “preponderance of evidence.”
Finally, the bill would require law enforcement to show that merchants or businessmen had criminal intent to avoid scrutiny in making bank deposits under $10,000.
The offense of “structuring” involves consistently making deposits of less than $10,000 in cash to avoid reporting requirements for banks aimed at criminals such as drug traffickers. In 2012, the IRS made 639 seizures involving what the agency considered suspicious bank deposits, up from 114 in 2005 for a total of $242 million, according to an Institute for Justice report.
The organization also found that the IRS made no claim of criminal activity in a third or more of those cases, other than cash deposits under $10,000, and had to return roughly half of the seized money—indicating the agency could not justify its actions.
“Our laws presume you are guilty until you can prove your innocence,” @RandPaul says of seizing assets.
“Civil forfeiture turns justice on its head,” Paul testified April 15 before the Senate Judiciary Committee. “Our current laws presume you are guilty until you can prove your innocence.”
The Kentucky Republican said lawmakers have an opportunity “to end an injustice” that “disproportionately affects” blacks, Hispanics and other minorities.

Lead co-sponsors of Walberg's bill in the House include Reps. Tony Cardenas, D-Calif., Keith Ellison, D-Minn., and Scott Garrett, R-N.J. Paul's co-sponsors in the Senate include Angus King, Jr., an independent from Maine.
‘Skewed Against Innocent Property Owners'
In a legal memorandum, Heritage Foundation scholar John Malcolm cites example after example of abuse by law enforcement officials as he outlines the history of a good idea that has been distorted over the years, especially as budgets were squeezed.
The result is “many stories of innocent victims” and procedures “skewed against innocent property owners,” Malcolm writes, showing the practice “has gone awry and is in serious need of reform.”
Malcolm, director of Heritage's Meese Center for Legal and Judicial Studies and the think tank's Gilbertson senior legal fellow, adds:
Some law enforcement authorities focus more on getting money and property and less on catching criminals—behavior that some have referred to as a form of legalized bounty hunting. Police and prosecutors end up having a substantial budgetary stake in forfeiture because in most cases, the proceeds from any forfeited property are returned to the agency that seized it for its use, thereby providing a direct funding mechanism that is totally outside the legislative appropriations and oversight process.
In 1986, the year after the Justice Department's Assets Forfeiture Fund was created, it took in $93.7 million in seized money. Twenty years later, annual deposits topped $1 billion, according to figures compiled by the Institute for Justice. In 2014, deposits totaled $4.4 billion, the highest amount in history.
Similarly, the Treasury Department's Forfeiture Fund took in more than $270 million in 2004. Seized cash rose to $1.6 billion in 2013.
Last year, an investigative series by The Washington Post called “Stop and Seize” found that since 2001, local and state police had seized $2.5 billion in cash from 62,000 individuals without filing warrants or criminal charges. Those who chose to fight the seizures sometimes waited a year or more for the return of their money, the newspaper said.
The Fraternal Order of Police, which represents rank-and-file officers, lists civil forfeiture reform among nine bills or proposals it intends to block in the current Congress.
“Like any government program, there can be found instances of abuse, and the FOP supports measures to combat such abuses and to improve the integrity of the program,” FOP President Chuck Canterbury testified at the April 15 hearing.
Among those siding with police agencies is Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala., who argued that denying them a cut of seized cash “would be a huge detriment.”
Sessions, working with Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., was instrumental in the passage of 2000 reforms they said were intended to protect “innocent citizens.” (Those changes included the current standard of a “preponderance of evidence” before authorities may seize property, replacing simple “probable cause.”)
The Justice Department and other law enforcement officials call for compromise, the Institute for Justice's Sheth notes, but allowing the practice to continue in some form actually would be the compromise.
‘When Is This Going to Change?'
“OK, we can retain civil forfeiture even though we probably shouldn't—it is unconstitutional and un-American—but … law enforcement should not benefit directly from it financially,” she said. “And people should not be forced to prove their innocence rather than the government proving that they're guilty.”
Jillian Lane, Paul's Senate press secretary, said the Paul-Walberg measure—one of a slate of criminal justice reforms proposed by the senator—would not have allowed the IRS to seize McLellan's company profits.
“It's not fair to the American people who work for a living,” store owner Lyndon McLellan says.
“It's not fair to the American people who work for a living,” McLellan told The Daily Signal, “that one day [the government] can knock on the door and say, ‘We took your money.'”
>>> After Government Seized His Motel, Owner Reflects on His Fight
Jason Snead, a research associate in Heritage's Meese Center for Legal and Judicial Studies, told The Daily Signal that law enforcement's legitimate concerns can be addressed.
“Congress should be prepared to adequately finance federal law enforcement agencies,” said Snead, who also has researched and written on the issue. “The same can be said of states and their agencies.”
And proposed reforms, he said, “will not interfere with legitimate cases targeting real criminals and their illicit activities.”
Snead noted that lawmakers in Minnesota, New Mexico, Montana and Washington, D.C., have reformed forfeiture statutes to provide greater legal protections for citizens. More than 20 other state legislatures are considering reform proposals.
“Federal reforms will certainly have the broadest impact, but there is need for reform at both the state and federal levels,” he said. “After all, even the best federal reforms will not stop a local cop or sheriff from abusing state forfeiture laws.”
In an email, Walberg pronounced himself “optimistic that the broad bipartisan coalition calling for reform will be impossible to ignore.”
It can't be soon enough for Lyndon McLellan.
“When is this going to change?” the store owner asked in the interview with The Daily Signal. “Who has to change it? It's Congress. It needs to happen.”

Update, 6:10 p.m.: The severe thunderstorm watch has been discontinued for the entire D.C. region except Calvert and St. Mary's county where some strong storms remain possible for the next couple of hours. Along/east of I-95 scattered showers are possible through 8-10 p.m. To the west, just an isolated shower or two may linger, but partial clearing should gradually commence if it hasn't already.
For more on the storm, follow the Post's storm news blog and interactive power outage tracker.
Update, 5:50 p.m.: Showers may linger as late as around 8 p.m., especially the further south and east you are. After that, we're well on our way to a gorgeous stretch of warm fall weather. See our delicious forecast for tomorrow into the work week.
Update, 5:20 p.m.: The Washington Post storm impacts live blog reports that trees fell onto two townhouses and an apartment complex not far from where a tornado was spotted in the Reston-Herndon area around 4:30 p.m., and that high winds have closed the Bay Bridge.
Some other storm impacts from around the area include a tree down near National Airport; wind gusts near 69 mph in Ashburn and near 60 mph in Quantico, Glenn Dale, Morningside, Beltsville, Gaithersburg, Chantilly, and near Dulles Airport and National Airport; downed power lines in NW DC (pic); downed trees in Alexandria (pic) and Silver Spring (pic); a collapsed building that was under construction in NE DC (pic). Also, in­cred­ibly, the storms dropped the temperatures at Dulles 25 degrees in less than 1 hour (from 89F to 64F between 3 and 4 p.m.). The storms have also left thousands without power, and halted the Nationals game in the bottom of the 9th (pic) with the Nats down a run.
Update, 5:05 p.m.: Currently no warnings are in effect across the area except for the Flash Flood Warning for D.C. proper until 6:30 p.m., where continuing showers mean a continuing concern for flooding.
Update, 4:50 p.m.: Collective sigh of relief as all Tornado Warnings have expired. Storms still stretch across most of the southern and eastern parts of the area, and the risk of showers and storms continues a few more hours for everyone, but the severe threat is starting to diminish.
Update, 4:35 p.m.: Severe storms continue to advance east across the area. One TORNADO WARNING remains in effect until 4:45 p.m. in southeast Anne Arundel County. In path of this storm: Londontowne, Selby-on-the-Bay, Shady Side. Elsewhere we have a Severe Thunderstorm Warning for eastern parts of the area until 5:15 p.m., from just east of I-95 to the Bay. Destructive winds to 70 mph+ continue to be a concern with these storms. Things calming down now for areas north and west of the Beltway, though a Flash Flood Warning remains in effect until 6:30 p.m. for D.C. proper.
See earlier updates lower down in this post.
Original overview (from 12:30 p.m.): A line of intense thunderstorms approaching from the west has prompted the National Weather Service to issue a Severe Thunderstorm Watch for the entire D.C.-Baltimore area until 10 p.m. Assuming they hold together, which we believe they should, the storms are expected to move west to east across the D.C. metro area between approximately 3 and 8 p.m. Besides lightning, damaging thunderstorm winds (potentially widespread) are the main concern, though there is some risk for tornadoes as well.
Several factors have come together to create the severe potential, including a strong cold front and fast upper-level winds. That said, there's some chance the worst of the storms occur to our northeast where the severe risk is even greater, especially as you get into northeast Maryland, eastern Pennsylvania, New Jersey and northward into Upstate New York and New England. Tornadoes have been reported in the NYC metro area this morning.
Stay tuned for updates here on this blog, on Twitter and Facebook.

Radar at 2 p.m. Screenshot from postweather.com
Update, 1:20 p.m.: This initial push of storms has veered north of the immediate metro area, primarily affecting Frederick and Carroll counties and northern Loudoun County. Probably after ~3 p.m. until the storm risk goes up for areas closer to D.C.
Update, 1:15 p.m.: The Tornado Warning around Hagerstown has been cancelled. But a Severe Thunderstorm Warning is in effect until 2:15 p.m. for most of Frederick and Carroll counties. Widespread damaging winds are possible with the intense storms moving from west to east through those areas.
Update, 12:55 p.m.: A Tornado Warning is in effect until 1:15 p.m. for NE Washington co in north central Maryland. This includes the Hagerstown area. NWS says the tornado may be wrapped in rain and hard to see.
In April, when SpaceX announced an ambitious mission to land an uncrewed Dragon spacecraft on Mars by 2018, one of the biggest questions was how much the private rocket company would spend on this venture. Now we have a ballpark estimate: $300 million.
During a meeting of NASA's Advisory Council Tuesday, one of the agency's deputy associate administrators, Jim Reuter, provided an overview of NASA's agreement with SpaceX, SpaceNews reports. NASA estimated that it would spend about $32 million on the mission, with SpaceX spending about 10 times as much.
The agency and the company have a Space Act agreement that bars the transfer of funds, but the agreement will allow NASA to assist SpaceX with some technical advice. NASA can also gather critical information about the Martian atmosphere and get tips on how to slow a large spacecraft descending toward the planet's surface. It's also likely that NASA, with its assets in orbit around Mars, will help facilitate communication between the Red Dragon and Earth.
SpaceX has not said how much it will spend on Red Dragon, but it views sending the six-ton spacecraft to the Martian surface as a precursor to its plans to land humans on the surface in the 2020s—and to eventually colonize the planet. The company's chief executive, Elon Musk, is expected to release more details about his Mars plans at an international conference in Mexico this September.
The Red Dragon mission will be a big first step. With a thin atmosphere, Mars doesn't provide a very effective medium for aerobraking. A spacecraft must attain a great velocity (and therefore invest a lot of energy) to reach Mars in six to nine months, and once it's there, it must then somehow shed that energy and slow down. Musk believes the upgraded Dragon 2 spacecraft will be able to use its eight SuperDraco engines to slow its velocity and then land on Mars in a powered descent, similar to the way the Apollo Lunar Module landed on the moon.
None of the spacecraft NASA has successfully flown to the surface of Mars have been nearly so large as Dragon, and no other country has ever soft landed a spacecraft on Mars that survived more than a handful of seconds. Even so, if NASA or SpaceX wants to send human missions to Mars, they must learn how to land payloads much heavier than Dragon, so this mission represents an interim step toward 10- and 20-ton payloads.
SpaceX has acknowledged that it must meet an aggressive schedule for a 2018 Mars launch, not the least of which is completing development of its Falcon Heavy rocket. If SpaceX can't meet the 2018 launch window, it will be forced to wait until 2020 when the planets again fall into a favorable alignment.
It may be an audacious plan, but an engineer familiar with the company's plans and efforts to land in the thin Martian atmosphere told Ars in April that the project is no lark. "It's something they've been working on for a while," said Bobby Braun, NASA's former chief technologist. "Don't get me wrong, it is certainly a risky proposition. But you've got to give them credit. They've been testing a lot of these Mars landing technologies already here on Earth. That certainly improves their chances of success."
I'm headed to the Progressive International Motorcycle Show in New York City tonight, and plan to work the hell out of the floor for the next two days. The folks who organize the show were nice enough to give me a press pass because of my blogging, so I'm attending a media event tomorrow morning before the show opens to the public at noon. Here are some of the things I'm hoping to accomplish and see at the show.
1. See to unveil of the new custom Cory Ness Victory motorcycle. Victory has been generating a ton of buzz in advance of the show, and is all over the motorcycle media. My hat's off to their PR firm. Nice work.
2. Meet The Gunny. The new face of Victory is R. Lee Ermey a/k/a “The Gunny” – who you may remember as the belligerent and abusive Gunnery Sergeant Hartmann in Stanley Kubrick's classic Full Metal Jacket. He's brilliant in reprising his role for Victory. I want to score a picture of me and him if possible.
3. Throw my leg over a Triumph Explorer. I love this bike. Would love to have one. Two more years of alimony first, though…
4. See the Ducati Panigale 1199. This was the bike that stole the show in Milan earlier this year. I want to see one in person, even though I'm not a sportbike guy.
5. Meet some of my fellow bloggers. I've got plans to catch up with Rachael of the fantastic “Girlie Motorcycle Blog” fuzzygalore.com and her fella Kenny; as well as Brett who is getting set to do something fantastic with IronAndAir.com (he hasn't launched on the web yet, but the stuff he's doing on Facebook is nothing short of fantastic. And humbling.)
If you're going to the show, give me a shout. I'll be tweeting from my handle @nobaffles.com (follow me!) and I'll be checking email frequently if you want to grab a cup of coffee. Send me a note with your cell or whereabouts at NoBaffles at Gmail dot com.
The travel industry is striking back against calls from Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump Donald John TrumpHouse committee believes it has evidence Trump requested putting ally in charge of Cohen probe: report Vietnamese airline takes steps to open flights to US on sidelines of Trump-Kim summit Manafort's attorneys say he should get less than 10 years in prison MORE to close American borders following terrorist attacks in Brussels.
The U.S. Travel Association released a statement condemning the attacks, while pushing policymakers to address security threats in a nuanced way.

"Words matter and move markets,” said the group's president and CEO, Roger Dow, without directly mentioning Trump. “It's just not realistic to ban religions, order war crimes, and end international travel. Bombast and bluster are no substitutes for thoughtful leadership.”
“We urge U.S. leaders to continue to embrace policies that emphasize collecting information in the most sophisticated and innovative ways possible in order to advance our ability to prevent such attacks here in the U.S. and abroad,” he said.
The U.S. Travel Association represents members in various sectors of the travel and hospitality industry, including Airbnb, the car rental company Enterprise Holdings, Carnival Corp. cruise lines, SeaWorld Parks & Entertainment, Hilton Hotels, Big Bus Tours, Caesars Entertainment, local tourism authorities and airports.
Not long after news of the three explosions that occurred in the Belgian capital of Brussels, Trump called into Fox & Friends and urged a tightening of U.S. borders.
“I would close up our borders to people until we figure out what's going on,” Trump said on the program Tuesday morning. “We have to be very, very vigilant with who we let into this country.”
“We don't know who they are or where they're from,” Trump continued. “We don't learn. I will tell you I've been talking about this for a long time. This whole thing will get worse as time goes by.”

"It's unrealistic to say that we're going to completely shut down our borders to everyone," Clinton said during an interview on NBC's "Today" show.
"We have been confronting the threat of terrorism for quite some time, and with the latest terrible manifestation of it, we've got to tighten our security," Clinton said. "I've talked about a visa system and a passenger name record system."
Dow, the head of U.S. Travel, also pushed for stricter security measures, while balancing the needs of travelers.
"The fact that travel and transit nodes were the object of this violence naturally has our full attention,” he said.
“Those who would do harm to the Western world are a deranged minority and should be treated as such — our travel security policies should work to identify and separate them from the pool of legitimate travelers so that law enforcement can focus their full resources on bad actors and prosecute them as vigorously as possible.”

Globalization is under attack. The electoral victory of Donald Trump, the Brexit vote and the rise of an aggressive nationalism in mainland Europe and around the world are all part of a backlash to globalization.
In each instance, citizens have upset the political order by voting to roll back economic, political and cultural globalization. Support for Brexit came in large part from those worried about their jobs and the entry of immigrants. Similarly, the Midwest of the U.S. – the industrial heartland hurt by global competition – was the linchpin of Donald Trump's victory.
But what exactly are these globalizations and why the discontent? A deeper examination of global integration sheds some light on how we got here and where we should go next.
The rise of the globalization agenda
The roots of today's global economic order were established just as World War II was coming to end. In 1944 delegates from the Allied countries met in Bretton Woods, New Hampshire to establish a new system around open markets and free trade.
New institutions such as the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and a precursor to the World Trade Organization were established to tie national economies into an international system. There was a belief that greater global integration was more conducive to peace and prosperity than economic nationalism.
Initially, it was more a promise than reality. Communism still controlled large swaths of territory. And there were fiscal tensions as the new trade system relied on fixed exchange rates, with currencies pegged to the U.S. dollar, which was tied to gold at the time. It was only with the collapse of fixed exchange rates and the unmooring of the dollar from the gold standard in the late 1960s that capital could be moved easily around the world.
And it worked: Dollars generated in Europe by U.S. multinationals could be invested through London in suburban housing projects in Asia, mines in Australia and factories in the Philippines. With China's entry onto the world trading system in 1978 and the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1989, the world of global capital mobility widened further.
Global transfer of wealth
While capital could now survey the world to ensure the best returns, labor was fixed in place. This meant there was a profound change in the relative bargaining power between the two – away from organized labor and toward a footloose capital. When a company such as General Motors moved a factory from Michigan to Mexico or China, it made economic sense for the corporation and its shareholders, but it did not help workers in the U.S.
Freeing up trade restrictions also led to a global shift in manufacturing. The industrial base shifted from the high-wage areas of North America and Western Europe to the cheaper-wage areas of East Asia: first Japan, then South Korea, and more recently China and Vietnam.
As a result, there was a global redistribution of wealth. In the West as factories shuttered, mechanized or moved overseas, the living standards of the working class declined. Meanwhile, in China prosperity grew, with the poverty rate falling from 84 percent in 1981 to only 12 percent by 2010.
Political and economic elites in the West argued that free trade, global markets and production chains that snaked across national borders would eventually raise all living standards. But as no alternative vision was offered, a chasm grew between these elites and the mass of blue-collar workers who saw little improvement from economic globalization.
The backlash against economic globalization is most marked in those countries such as the U.S. where economic dislocation unfolds with weak safety nets and limited government investment in job retraining or continuing and lifetime education.
Expanding free markets
Over the decades, politicians enabled globalization through trade organizations and pacts such as the North American Free Trade Agreement, passed in 1994. The most prominent, though, was the European Union, an economic and political alliance of most European countries and a good example of an unfolding political globalization.
It started with a small, tight core of Belgium, France, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands and West Germany. They signed the Treaty of Rome in 1957 to tie former combatants into an alliance that would preclude further conflicts – and form a common market to compete against the U.S.
Over the years, more countries joined, and in 1993 the European Union (EU) was created as a single market with the free movement of goods, people and capital and common policies for agriculture, transport and trade. Access to this large common market attracted former Communist bloc and Soviet countries, to the point where the EU now extends as far east as Cyprus and Bulgaria, Malta in the south and Finland in the north.
With this expansion has come the movement of people – hundreds of thousands of Poles have moved to the U.K. for instance – and some challenges.
The EU is now at a point of inflexion where the previous decades of continual growth are coming up against popular resistance to EU enlargement into poorer and more peripheral countries. Newer entrants often have weaker economies and lower social welfare payments, prompting immigration to the richer members such as France and the U.K.
Cultural backlash
The flattening of the world allowed for a more diverse ensemble of cultural forms in cuisine, movies, values and lifestyles. Cosmopolitanism was embraced by many of the elites but feared by others. In Europe, the foreign other became an object of fear and resentment, whether in the form of immigrants or in imported culture and new ways.
But evidence of this backlash to cultural globalization also exists around the world. The ruling BJP party in India, for example, combines religious fundamentalism and political nationalism. There is a rise of religious fundamentalism around the world in religions as varied as Buddhism, Christianity, Hinduism, Islam and Judaism.
Old-time religion, it seems, has become a refuge from the ache of modernity. Religious fundamentalism held out the promise of eternal verities in the rapidly changing world of cultural globalization.
There is also a rising nationalism, as native purity is cast as contrast to the profane foreign. Across Europe from Bulgaria to Poland and the U.K., new nationalisms have a distinct xenophobia. Politicians such as Marine Le Pen in France recall an idealized past as a cure for the cultural chaos of modernity. Politicians can often gain political traction by describing national cultural traditions as under attack from the outside.
Indeed, the fear of immigration has resulted in the most dramatic backlash against the effects of globalization, heightening national and racial identities. In the U.S. white native-born American moved from being the default category to a source of identity clearly mobilized by the Trump campaign.
Reclaiming globalization
Globalization has now become the catchword to encompass the rapid and often disquieting and disruptive social and economic change of the past 25 years. No wonder there is a significant backlash to the constant change - much of it destabilizing economically and socially disruptive. When traditional categories of identity evaporate quickly, there is a profound political and cultural unease.
The globalization project contains much that was desirable: improvements in living conditions through global trade, reducing conflict and threat of war through political globalization and encouraging cultural diversity in a widening cultural globalization.
The question now, in my view, is not whether we should accept or reject globalization but how we shape and guide it to these more progressive goals. We need to point the project toward creating more just and fair outcomes, open to difference but sensitive to cultural connections and social traditions.
A globalization project of creating a more connected, sustainable, just and peaceful world is too important to be left to the bankers and the political elites.
24 hours for Lunatic-Hai to replace the newest recruits after fan backlash
Barely a week since Lee "claris" Keon-Ho and Byeon "Munchkin" Sang-Beom had been selected to join the newly expanded Lunatic-Hai roster for APEX Season 3 comes the news today that they have both departed by mutual agreement between the players and the team. Lunatic-Hai had been on the hunt for new members since last month after OGN ruled that a single player could now be switched out during APEX matches in Season 3.
Originally Munchkin had been accused of being the owner of an infamously toxic ranked account. The alt account, named “은평구꽃사슴”, had a history of showing severe toxicity towards almost everyone he met on high level competitive play. The players included pros such as LEETAEJUN, who he flamed on his ability to play Tracer and that he should "stick to hog". The account, witnessed by multiple Twitch streamers, become such a controversy that the community kept a keen eye for clues and eventually was able to link it to Munchkin. Munchkin denied the accusations, claiming it was his "close irl friend that he doesn't talk too much".
This part of the story actually caught the attention of Thorin and MonteCristo over the weekend on their most recent edition of OverSight.
A few hours ago, in the face of mounting pressure, he finally admitted to having lied on his previous statement. Although originally Lunatic-Hai had decided they would give him another chance, a massive backlash from their fans and the wider community seems to have left them with no other choice but to drop Munchkin.
The case of claris is much less cut and dried. And it seems that with no admission of guilt over percieved wrongdoings, it is the Lunatic-Hai fans who have become judge, jury and executioner.
Known for being extremely vocal when it comes to deciding who to dislike, Lunatic-Hai fans had made claris the victim witch hunt in recent days, publicly bullying over baseless accusations of cheating and running a boosting service. Today he announced his resignation from his newfound team, citing the intense pressure of the situation, but continuing to deny the claims.
Reports have now surfaced that these inflammatory claims were mostly nonsense. So it seems claris may yet have a bright future in front of him, albeit be out of Lunatic-Hai.
After losing both of the new players, Lunatic-Hai have brought in Gido, who they had previously rated third in their original selection process behind Munchkin and claris. Even within the Korean scene relatively little is known about the new recruit other than that he doesn't seem to have any significant controversy surrounding him, but that may well be the most important requirement to play for Lunatic-Hai at present.
Official APEX Season 3 rosters were originally supposed to be finalized today, but OGN have extended the deadline by 24 hours -- most likely prompted by this drama and uncertainty cast over the reigning champions, Lunatic-Hai. For now it remains unclear who may be called on to fill the potential 8th spot on their APEX roster.
The Lunatic-Hai roster is currently:
As the rainy season is fast approaching in China, Xiaomi seems to focus on items of clothing and accessories that would aid users during the cold weather on its MIJIA platform. The company recently unveiled the Charpa Temperature Control Quilt and now, they have announced new product under the MIJIA brand. This time around it is a hooded sweater.
The sweater is dubbed Classic Wild Hooded sweater and it comes in at just 149 Yuan ($23). The sweater comes with a classic design with a top-notch tailoring. It is produced from nylon material on the inside and highly elastic silk material on the outside.The stitches are done using high-density knitting.

With a new light rail station soon to open (March 19th) up on the University of Washington campus, the Seattle Department of Transportation (SDOT) has teamed up with their partner transit agencies to turn the Montlake Triangle into a new transit hub. SDOT is improving the overall transit rider experience and revising the local bus stop configuration. Two new bus stops are under construction on NE Pacific St (both are relocations), a third stop will open northbound on Montlake Boulevard, and fourth stop (also on Montlake Boulevard) will reopen after a long hiatus. All of this is due for completion in advance of the Spring service change due on March 26th.
Last year, King County Metro and Sound Transit collaborated on a regional process to revise select portions of the bus network throughout Seattle and the Eastside in order to make better use of forthcoming light rail stations at Capitol Hill and the University of Washington. Through that process, the King County Council and Sound Transit Board of Directors adopted substantial changes to how the bus network would operate, particularly through the University of Washington. This, of course, has necessitated local improvements to ensure that bus and rail connections work.
As it is, the light station is located on the east side of Montlake Boulevard, a wide, complex, and fast-moving street. It's not exactly an ideal location for bus transfers, let alone people on foot or bike, which is why Sound Transit and the University of Washington have invested heavily in pedestrian bridges. But SDOT wants to make bus transfers to and from rail just a little quicker and easier.
Bus stops in both directions on NE Pacific St will be moved a block or so east from their current locations, saving transferring riders about two minutes in walking time. But as with any bus stop change, there are some drawbacks. The most obvious are longer walking times for a very select few trips within the UW Medical Center complex and buildings at the very southeast of the UW campus. For most riders though, the bus stop changes will likely be a very welcome improvement.
The new stops will come with upgrades like real-time arrival information signs, a wider curb area, and better shelters.
A new westbound stop on NE Pacific St will have four bus shelters, meaning a net increase of three from today, while the eastbound stop will remain with four. SDOT is also filling in an on-street parking strip on the north side of NE Pacific St so that buses don't have to pull into the curb to pick up passengers. Instead, buses will travel and stop in the furthest right lane like today. The benefit of this configuration, of course, is that the curb area will be wider to give waiting passengers more comfort and allow pedestrians to walk on the main sidewalk unobstructed.
Another bus shelter will also open at a new northbound stop on Montlake Boulevard. This is being added because revised bus service for two Northeast Seattle routes will now directly service the Link station. Routes 65 and 78 will loop around the University of Washington campus before continuing onto 15th Ave NE, NE Pacific St, and then northbound Montlake Boulevard, bringing them right to the footsteps of University of Washington Station. SDOT will also reopen the former southbound stop on Montlake Boulevard, which was closed during reconstruction of the Montlake Triangle and pedestrian bridges across the roadway. That stop will be served by routes 44, 45, 71, 73, and 373.
Real-time information signs will be installed exclusively at the Pacific Street stops; not the other four bus stops nearby. SDOT plans to have the real-time information signs show all of the routes that service a stop. In the westbound direction, ten King County Metros and four Sound Transit routes will serve the stop there while six King County Metros and five Sound Transit routes will serve the eastbound stop.
Additional signage will also be introduced throughout the area. Sound Transit, King County Metro, and SDOT are actively coordinating an effort to ensure that signage style is consistent across stops and the station. The four closest bus stops to the station will be signed as “bus bays” and numbered one through four. Area maps will be located at the station to help guide riders to the appropriate bus bay by number and identify which routes service each stop. Directional signage will also be placed on the station grounds to give riders further assurance that they're heading in the right direction for their transfer. Once riders arrive at the station, they will be welcomed by dynamic signage with live information by OneBusAway and entrances themselves will have ample signage to direct them to trains.
All in all, SDOT and their partner transit agencies are trying to make the Montlake Triangle and University of Washington Station transfer area work better for the riders that will pass through everyday. These investments will go a long way toward achieving that. But there's still ample opportunity to improve how buses operate through the area and minimize delay to transferring riders.

A video clip has been released today showing billionaire industrialist David Koch on stage getting reports from regional organizers on their efforts to rally the Tea Party movement.
David Koch, who has received a lot of attention lately for the millions he has spent over the years boosting right-wing organizations like Americans for Prosperity, has tried on numerous occasions to distance himself from the supposedly "grassroots" Tea Party phenomenon.
Case in point, David Koch told New York magazine this summer in an interview that:
"I've never been to a tea-party event. No one representing the tea party has ever even approached me."
The clip released today, taken from a new documentary called (Astro) Turf Wars: How Corporate America Faked a Grassroots Revolution, clearly shows David Koch receiving reports from regional Tea Party organizers:
In another attempt to distance Koch from the Tea Party, earlier this year I received an email from a representative from Koch Industries stating that,
"Because you have covered tea parties in the past and we imagine you will cover tomorrow's Tax Day Tea Party in DC, we want to reiterate some important facts. "Koch companies value free speech and believe it is good to have more Americans engaged in key policy issues. That said, Koch companies, the Koch foundations, Charles Koch and David Koch have no ties to and have never given money to FreedomWorks. In addition, no funding has been provided by Koch companies, the Koch foundations, Charles Koch or David Koch specifically to support the tea parties.
Thanks for your consideration." [my emphasis]
The video released today shows organizers reporting to David Koch on their success on organizing one of the "largest Tea Parties in the country" on Tea Party Tax Day.
As Suzanne Goldenberg, who broke this story in the Gaurdian todaywrites:
"It [the Tea Party] likes to present itself as a grassroots insurgency made up of hundreds of local groups intent on toppling the Washington elite. But the Tea Party movement, which is threatening to cause an upset in next month's midterm elections, would not be where it is today without the backing of that most traditional of US political supporters - Big Oil."
The filmmaker behind the (Astro) Turf Wars documentary, Taki Oldham, told the Gaurdian that:
"This is a world of shadows. In my mind, without a doubt nobody has had more influence on the anti-Obama campaign than the Koch-funded groups."
David Koch, along with his brother Charles Koch, are listed by Forbes as the 5th and 6th most wealthy billionaires in America, and run the privately-held corporation, Koch Industries which is considered the largest private energy company in America. Through their foundations they have invested millions in organizations that have fought health care reform and proposals to reduce industrial pollution and cap greenhouse gases.
SINN FÉIN HAS defended a leaflet it is distributing in Northern Ireland which contains the religious breakdown of a constituency for the Westminster elections.
A leaflet, published by the party's MLA Gerry Kelly, contains figures from the 2011 census showing that there are now more Catholics than Protestants in North Belfast and urges people to ‘Make the Change, Make History'.
Kelly is attempting to unseat sitting DUP MP Nigel Dodds in the elections next Thursday. Dodds narrowly held onto the traditionally unionist seat in the 2010 UK general election.
The leaflet says there is now “a majority of 1,305 nationalists” in the constituency, citing the 2011 figures, and urges voters to elect Kelly to “defend all citizens against austerity, sectarianism and the failed politics of the past”.
Kelly insisted that the leaflet was presenting official census figures and offered “compelling official evidence of significant demographic change”. He said such figures are used to predict future political and electoral trends.
But Labour TD Robert Dowds, who is Protestant, accused Sinn Féin and Kelly of “blatant sectarianism” and said the “mask has dropped” with this latest election literature.
“This is blatant sectarianism on the part of Sinn Féin, and they should be absolutely ashamed of themselves. Sinn Féin claim to be republicans but there is absolutely nothing republican about exploiting divisions between people of different religions for electoral gain, yet this is clearly what they are trying to do,” Dowds said.
Rather than trying to reach out to the Protestant community, as they claim to do, they are deliberately trying to increase tensions between both communities and to exploit such tensions in pursuit of votes.
Dublin-based Fine Gael councillor Neale Richmond said the leaflet had no place in a modern democracy and accused Sinn Féin of trying to equate religious denomination with political preference.
“This leaflet flies in the face of their supposed claim to represent Catholic, Protestant and dissenter. It makes a mockery of our complex history as an island and is a slur against the intelligence of great patriots such as Wolfe Tone, Parnell and Blythe,” he said.
Horribly sectarian leaflet from Sinn Fein up North. Can we expect the same in the Republic next year? pic.twitter.com/MMvuqKMKnt — Sen. Neale Richmond (@nealerichmond) April 30, 2015 Source: Cllr Neale Richmond /Twitter
However, in response to a query from TheJournal.ie, Kelly said in a statement that he rejected accusations of sectarianism. He insisted the graphic was a direct lift from official government figures.
“[It] was a faithful representation of the statistics as compiled by NISRA [Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency] and compelling official evidence of significant demographic change. These official statistics are used widely by individuals and organisations – academic, media and political – to predict future political and electoral trends.
I reject absolutely sectarianism, racism and homophobia and will continue to represent all constituents without fear or favour.
Kelly also attacked the Labour party for focusing on the issue, saying its approach to Northern Irish politics is inconsistent.
“Labour's new found interest in the northern election is welcome given the fact that they have ignored the attacks on the LGBT community by a DUP health minster stating child abuse was more prevalent in gay relationships,” he said.
“If there was any level of consistency from Labour in their apparent concerns for northern politics more people might take their comments at face value.”
The third time was the charm for Prasad Panda as he won the Calgary-Foothills byelection on Thursday, delivering a major breakthrough for the Wildrose Party — and the first major blow to Premier Rachel Notley's NDP.
Panda, who ran and lost for Wildrose in the 2012 and 2015 provincial elections, took an early lead over the NDP's Bob Hawkesworth and held it as the votes rolled in throughout the night, eventually winning by 1,607 votes over his nearest opponent.
With all 66 polls reporting, Panda had captured 38 per cent of the vote, with Hawkesworth trailing at 26 per cent. Progressive Conservative Blair Houston was close behind in third place with 22 per cent of the votes cast.
The race was fought in the midst of economic turmoil and Panda said there is a clear message for Notley.
“The message is clear that people are concerned about jobs and economy. That's what they expressed in this vote,” Panda said in an interview. “She has to reflect (on) the verdict here in Calgary-Foothills.”
Liberal Ali Bin Zahid, the Alberta Party's Mark Taylor, Green Janet Keeping and Independent Antoni Grochowski brought up the rear in the seven-person race. Voter turnout was 39 per cent.
Hawkesworth, a former NDP MLA and Calgary alderman, had touted government policies such as committing to fund a new Calgary cancer centre, as well as the benefits of having an MLA in government.
The 64-year-old political veteran told reporters Thursday the NDP government will proceed with the mandate it was elected on, but Notley will heed the byelection results.
“The premier is very conscious, very sensitive to what she's hearing from people all across the province,” he said.
Calgary-Foothills has long been a stronghold for the Progressive Conservatives. But as the four-decade-old Tory dynasty went down to defeat at the hand of the NDP this spring, then-premier Jim Prentice abruptly resigned the seat he had just won, requiring a byelection.
The victory is a significant moment for Wildrose, which formed the official Opposition after the May election.
Winning the longtime PC citadel bolsters party leader Brian Jean's argument that Wildrose is the default conservative alternative in Alberta. He noted in an interview that Wildrose had won in “the strongest PC riding in the province.”
“That clearly indicates the PCs were yesterday and Wildrose is the party of tomorrow for common-sense fiscal conservatives,” said Jean.
As well, the win means Wildrose once again has an urban foothold. The party had won two seats in Calgary in 2012, but was shut out in the spring campaign.
“This was a seat they had to win and did. But it wasn't easy,” Mount Royal political scientist Duane Bratt said of the Wildrose victory. “I think we saw conservative voters abandoning the PCs and going to the Wildrose Party — that was the major driver.”
Panda, a 50-year-old senior manager at Suncor who edged out two other candidates for the Wildrose nomination, positioned his party in the campaign as defenders of Alberta jobs.
With the provincial economy and government finances slammed by the sagging price of oil, Panda said the NDP has done nothing to improve the situation.
The government's first budget won't be released until the legislature reconvenes at the end of October.
Panda said NDP policies — hiking corporate taxes, reviewing the province's royalty regime and raising the hourly minimum wage to $15 by 2018 — have only made the province's economic malaise worse.
Jean said Notley should note the byelection results by pledging to work more closely and consider cancelling the royalty review and planned overhaul of climate change policy.
“The message to the NDP is please tread more carefully,” he added.
The win raises Wildrose seat count to 22 in the 87-seat legislature. The NDP continues to have a comfortable majority at 53 seats.
While the win gives a boost to Wildrose, the loss is a disappointment to the NDP, who were hoping to continue to surf the orange wave that brought them to power this spring.
The party faced a tough fight in the riding because of its conservative leanings and the ongoing economic turmoil, but Notley and a slew of NDP MLAs appeared in the constituency to campaign for Hawkesworth.
NDP Finance Minister Joe Ceci, the senior cabinet minister from Calgary, told supporters at Hawkesworth's campaign that the election had been a “hard-fought race.”
“We had no illusions in this byelection. We know that it was an uphill battle given the history of the riding and the economic challenges we face because of the collapse in world oil prices,” Ceci told a crowd that serenaded Hawkesworth with “For he's a jolly good fellow.”
Ceci told reporters the government needs to ensure that its policies resonate with voters but it will proceed with a job and economic growth plan to be released in conjunction with its budget.
While the PCs had a relatively strong third-place showing, the loss could raise further questions about the future of the party, which holds nine seats in the legislature.
Interim PC leader Ric McIver accepted the loss in the party's stronghold, but said there was much to celebrate.
“We've proven to Albertans that we're alive and well and relevant, having come this close after our former MLA quit in the most negative circumstances ever,” McIver said.
Liberal Ali Bin Zahid, who placed a distant fourth, said his party has been in the process of rebuilding, something that “does not happen overnight.”
“The honeymoon is over for the NDP,” he said. “People were still angry with the PCs, so they looked for the next best conservative option.”

The Boston Port Act was an Act of the Parliament of Great Britain[1] which became law on March 31, 1774, and took effect on June 1, 1774.[2] It was one of five measures (variously called the Intolerable Acts, the Punitive Acts or the Coercive Acts) that were enacted during the spring of 1774 to punish Boston for the Boston Tea Party.[3]
History [ edit ]
The Act was a response to the Boston Tea Party. King George III's speech of 7 March 1774 charged the colonists with attempting to injure British commerce and subvert the Constitution, and on the 18th Lord North brought in the Port Bill. It outlawed the use of the Port of Boston (by setting up a barricade/blockade) for "landing and discharging, loading or shipping, of goods, wares, and merchandise" until such time as restitution was made to the King's treasury (for customs duty lost) and to the East India Company for damages suffered. In other words, it closed Boston Port to all ships, no matter what business the ship had. It also provided that Massachusetts Colony's seat of government should be moved to Salem and Marblehead made a port of entry. The Act was to take effect on June 1.[4]
Even some of the strongest allies of America in Parliament at first approved the Act as moderate and reasonable, arguing that the town could end the punishment at any time by paying for the merchandise destroyed in the riot and allowing law and order to have their course. But the Whig opposition soon collected itself, and the bill was fought in its various stages by Edmund Burke, Isaac Barré, Thomas Pownall and others. In spite of them, the Act became a law 31 March, without a division in the Commons and by unanimous vote in the Lords.[4]
Royal Navy warships subsequently began patrols at the mouth of Boston Harbor to enforce the acts. The British Army also joined in enforcing the blockade, and Boston was filled with troops, Thomas Gage, commander-in-chief.[4] Colonists protested that the Port Act penalized thousands of residents and violated their rights as subjects of George III.[2]
As the Port of Boston was a major source of supplies for the citizens of Massachusetts, sympathetic colonies as far away as South Carolina sent relief supplies to the settlers of Massachusetts Bay. So great was the response, that the Boston leaders boasted that the town would become the chief grain port of America if the act were not repealed.[4] June 1 was widely observed as a day of fasting and prayer, bells being tolled, flags placed at half-mast, and houses draped in mourning.[5] This was the first step in the unification of the thirteen colonies, which now had a cause for which to work together. The First Continental Congress was convened in Philadelphia on September 5, 1774, to coordinate a colonial response to the Port Act and the other Coercive Acts.[6]

A new website for the Yahara Lakes is called lakeforecast.org.
The website creators say it can be used the same way you check the weather before leaving the house.
The Clean Lakes Alliance, City of Madison, Dane County, Mio Soft, UW-Madison Center for Limnology, and the Space Science and Engineering Center teamed up to put this together.
They say it's the first of it's kind in the world because of the combination of citizen, lifeguard, public health and university monitoring.
"There are state beaches, village beaches, county beaches and city beaches. So, this is the only site that brings all of those different beaches together. That's the first thing. The second thing is the City of Madison lifeguards are coming out and doing testing on several of the beaches every day when they check in for work. So, that information is only available on lakeforecast.org," said James Tye the Executive Director for Clean Lakes Alliance.
You can find if a beach is open, the water quality, and temperature before hitting the sand.
"As you can see today, a beautiful beach at Tenney Park. The water is clear there's a lifeguard on duty. We only have a few people in the lake. What we want to do is promote our great beaches, promote our great parks and get more people onto the park. This way we know it's a safe clean place to go to," said Tye.
The site is user friendly. You'll see a number of icons mapped at all the beaches on the Yahara Lakes.
A blue thumbs up means clear blue water, and a green hand means green murky water. The gray hand means that beach has not had a reaching in 48 hours. You can also click on each icon for more details on that beach.
As They Dig Deeper Into Parenting, Fathers Seek Community, Support
Enlarge this image toggle caption DGLimages/Getty Images/iStockphoto DGLimages/Getty Images/iStockphoto
As a Seattle-based fiction writer and a part-time stay-at-home dad, Josh Mohr, 40, spends his days in the world of make-believe.
His routine begins at approximately 5:30 a.m. when his 3-year-old daughter, Ava, waves a magic wand to turn him into a children's storyteller.
Mohr cozies up to his toddler, who's dressed for the occasion in a purple princess dress and a sparkly crown with rainbow jewels. After they've finished a few readings of Curious George, Ava asks her dad to read the story again.
"Again, Daddy. Let's do it again," she says.
As repetitive as this may seem, their little ritual fills Mohr with pride.
"When I was a kid, my dad worked long hours, and because of this, he wasn't very involved in my life. With Ava, I don't want to have that same regret, and so I am re-inventing my fatherhood role," Mohr says. "I don't want to look back when she's older and wish that I had spent more time with her at the park, telling her silly stories and putting her to bed at night."
Mohr's sense that he's parenting from a new and different playbook than the one that his father used is not uncommon. A survey published by the Pew Research Center last year reveals that more and more dads are staying at home to help care for their children.
In fact, since 1965, fathers have more than doubled their family involvement. This includes spending more time with their kids as well as devoting additional time to household tasks like grocery shopping, cooking, and cleaning. Fathers and mothers equally report that parenting is an essential part of their identities and that balancing work and home life is challenging.
But greater family involvement doesn't necessarily mean that today's dads are fathering with confidence.
"Just because dads are changing diapers, carrying their babies around in a Baby Bjorn and driving their kids to soccer games doesn't mean that they feel confident about their fatherhood roles," says Will Courtenay, a psychotherapist and men's health expert in Oakland, Calif.
Courtenay says that today's dads are participating in aspects of parenting that their own fathers may have neglected, and because of this cultural shift they are less likely to turn to their dads for parenting advice.
According to research conducted by the Fatherhood Initiative, a nonprofit organization that creates fatherhood education programs for community organizations, 50 percent of fathers don't feel prepared for parenthood.
Matt Lowe, 36, of Kansas City, Mo., is a married father of a teenage daughter. Lowe grew up with an absent father who struggled with alcoholism, and he remembers well how deeply his dad's personal issues affected their relationship.
"My parents were separated for part of my childhood, and this led to feelings of bitterness and resentment. There were times when I felt hurt and I pushed my dad away. For me, fatherhood is an opportunity to work through that and try to ensure I don't foster these feelings with my daughter," says Lowe.
Lowe makes a concerted effort to spend significant time with his daughter, and he tries to reflect upon his parenting practices.
"I worry that I spoil her or maybe overlook things that I shouldn't, but I try to be mindful of this in the best way that I can."
While Lowe and Mohr are consciously fathering their children differently from how they were raised, finding parenting support geared towards dads hasn't been easy. For one thing, many of today's most popular parenting books and blogs are targeted at women.
"I've been a father for 14 years, and I've never read a parenting book or blog because the information is written for mothers and it's boring," says Lowe.
Instead, many dads rely on their partners for advice. A small study of expectant fathers published in the December issue of the journal Social Work Research reveals that even before their children are born, men tend to ask their partners how to parent.
However, this doesn't necessarily help strengthen the father-child relationship, nor is it a replacement for the community that many dads crave.
There are a plethora of new mom and baby groups, as well as online forums and blogs, to help women transition into motherhood, but fewer options when it comes to dads.
There are some "daddy blogs" like greatDad.com and howtobeadad.com written by dads for dads, but these resources don't always help fathers navigate the day-to-day emotional challenges, such as feelings of insecurity, partnership stress and the new daddy blues that parenthood brings.
Also, says Courtenay, "Dads may be less inclined to talk about their feelings at a parenting group, but they want to connect. Oftentimes they look to other dads to figure out what they're supposed to do as a father, and many dads say that they feel a responsibility to help other fathers improve their parenting skills."
Even though he's never taken a formal parenting class, Lowe turns to the fellow fathers in his school and neighborhood communities to help show him the ropes. This informal sort of "dads' group" helps teach him about everything from how to discipline a teenager to the importance of self care.
"I watch the way that my friends balance their work and family life. They might take an afternoon to go on a hike or to go golfing, and this has taught me that it is OK for me to take time for myself, too," Lowe says.
As a newer father, Mohr is creating his own dads group by reaching out to the elder fathers in his community. He says that he asks his friends about their parenting highs and lows and that he learns from the parental wisdom that these friends share.
"Parenthood has taught me that you're never above the humble process of learning," Mohr says. "Even if my friends parent differently than I do, I realize that we are all in this together."

Say what you will about ridiculous Megaupload founder Kim Dotcom, but the way authorities went about prosecuting him was sloppy and (in part) illegal. Dotcom is understandably angry, and now he has someone to direct all that anger towards: Vice President Joe Biden.
Cloud-locker and file sharing service Megaupload was shut down in January by U.S. and New Zealand authorities as part of a massive sting operation against websites that facilitated copyright infringement or piracy. The governments, which claim that the site was responsible for pirating over $500 million worth of digital content, had Dotcom arrested and seized many of his assets, including his $4.3 million home. The U.S. government filed an extradition request for Dotcom, who lives in New Zealand, which has yet to be resolved.
Dotcom told TorrentFreak today that Biden is responsible for having authorities target Megaupload under direction by MPAA (Motion Picture Association of America) president and former U.S. Sen. Christopher Dodd. A case against Megaupload was discussed at the White House in June 2011 during a meeting that included several international figures and movie studio representatives, according to one of Dotcom's unnamed informants.
“After we received information from an insider, we scanned the White House visitor logs for all meetings of Chris Dodd and studio bosses with Joe Biden and Obama,” Dotcom said, noting that the logs are publicly available on the White House's official website. “It is interesting that a man by the name of Mike Ellis of MPA Asia, an extradition expert and former superintendent of the Hong Kong police, was also at a meeting with Dodd, all studio bosses, and Joe Biden. The same Mike Ellis met with the Minister of Justice Simon Power in New Zealand.”
So, Dotcom knows when, where, and who met to discuss how best to take down Megaupload. He also apparently knows that Biden was the one suggesting a plan of action regarding Megaupload's take down to the attorney general. Congratulations, Mr. Dotcom, you've solved … well, nothing. Yet, he does promise to reveal more “at the appropriate time.”
“The whole Mega case is quite the political thriller,” Dotcom said. Yes, a “political thriller” much in the same way an awesomely bad movie is.
I could debate Biden's view points on piracy for several paragraphs, but I won't. That said, I have no doubt that Biden was involved with the Megaupload case in some shape or form. He's got a long history of advocating for harsher digital piracy laws and has gone on record saying that digital goods are no different from physical goods in the entertainment business. But when it comes to his involvement with the Megaupload case, he really can't be held accountable for anything. He's got opinions about how to stop piracy, and the people who run the government probably asked for his advice, or at the very least listened to whatever he had to say.
The other thing that strikes me as odd about Dotcom's “investigation” is that he's trying to gather dirt against a group of business leaders and politicians who aren't hiding their opinions about piracy. Of course they're biased toward taking Megaupload down. They all think the site is guilty.
And while it's certainly amusing to watch him play the New Zealand version of Sherlock Holmes, his best bet for coming out on top is to continue exploiting the government's missteps. For example, the disregard for keeping Megaupload user data (found on third-party servers) as incriminating evidence, the illegal search/seizure of his property, and the lack of due process prior to Megaupload's shut down.
Palantir Technologies has come out and said that it did not discriminate against Asian people, Fortune reports. This comes after the U.S. Department of Labor sued the company for alleged racial discrimination against Asian people in its hiring and selection process.
According to the DOL's suit, Palantir allegedly used a hiring process that discriminated against Asian applicants for software engineering roles, “routinely eliminated” qualified Asian applicants in the resume screening and telephone interview phases and hired a majority of people from its discriminatory employee referral system.
In a 15-page filing, Palantir fired back at the DOL, saying that the allegations “were entirely unfounded and based solely on a flawed statistical analysis.” Palantir also said that the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs made a mistake in evaluating the quality of applicants.
To strengthen its point, Palantir said that it has hired and retained Asian employees at “rates that exceed their presence in the relevant labor market.” The company noted that it has a workforce that is 25 percent Asian, with Asian people making up 37 percent of its product engineering team, according to Palantir's filing.
Because Palantir is a federal contractor, the company has a legal requirement to ensure that its hiring practices are free of discrimination. The federal government has contracted services from Palantir since January 2010.
Those contracts are worth $340 million, according to the lawsuit. If the lawsuit moves forward, and Palantir does not comply with the requests from the DOL, it would lose its contracts with the FBI, the U.S. Special Operations Command and the Army.
Palantir has raised more than $2.3 billion from investors and was valued at $20 billion during its last institutional round. The case is currently pending.
Orange Is the New Black breakout star Laverne Cox was cast as fishnet fatale Frank-N-Furter back in October, but now the Rocky Horror Picture Show remake—which willair on Fox in the fall—has cast the two characters made immortal in the cult film by Barry Bostwick and Susan Sarandon.
Wide-eyed Brad and Janet will be played by Victoria Justice (a former Nickelodeon tween star) and Ryan McCartan, Deadline reports. They join a cast that (in addition to Cox) already includes Staz Nair, who'll don the title character's gold hot pants, and Reeve Carney (of Penny Dreadful), who'll time warp as Riff Raff. Still unannounced include key fan-fave characters like Magenta, Columbia, Dr. Scott, and Eddie. (Come on, guys. You know you want to bring back Meat Loaf. Just admit it.)

The 1975 Rocky Horror Picture Show, adapted from the stage musical, became one of the first cult-movie sensations thanks to its performances (including Tim Curry as the iconic Frank-N-Furter) and its unique appeal as an interactive viewing experience for audiences. According to the New York Times, the TV remake—which, notably, is NOT a live special—will be executive produced by one of the original film's producers, Lou Adler, and will be directed, produced, and choreographed by Kenny Ortega of High School Musical fame.

Folks… you just can't make this stuff up.
On July 6th, just two days ago, at least a dozen busybody Congressmen sponsored the introduction of HR 2411, the “Reduce America's Debt Now Act of 2011.” They always come up with fantastic names for these pieces of legislation… and rest assured, the better/more patriotic the name, the more ominous the bill. This one follows the pattern.
HR 2411 states that every worker in America should be able to voluntarily have a portion of his/her wages automatically withheld and sent directly to the Treasury Department for the purposes of paying down the federal debt.
“Every employer making payment of wages shall deduct and withhold upon such wages any amounts so elected, and shall pay such amounts over to the Secretary of the Treasury…”
That's right. Uncle Sam is so broke that he wants to give all the good little Americans out there the opportunity to contribute an even greater portion of their paychecks to finance government largess.
Desperate? Hmmm…. Don't worry, it gets better.
Obviously, if an employee feels so compelled and should elect to have a portion of his/her paycheck withheld, the onus of responsibility is now on the employer to make it happen. The employer has to do all the paperwork, withhold the money, send the payment to the Treasury, maintain the account records, and probably submit to all kinds of new filing requirements.
You can imagine that, if passed, the bill will result in a host of new IRS regulations, complete with a battery of penalties for employers who don't fill out the paperwork properly, submit filings on time, or make some administrative mistake.
Think about it: if a small business owner has one single employee who is dumb enough to think that it's his patriotic duty to pay down the debt and decides to contribute $1/month, that owner will have the responsibility for all kinds of new forms and filings, plus submit to new ‘debt reduction audits.'
But don't worry, it gets even better.
So let's say there are millions of sheep out there who elect to donate a portion of their toil and sweat so that the Chinese and big financial institutions don't have to worry about an American default. How does Congress plan on rewarding its most patriotic citizens? By sticking it to them on their taxes, of course.

Members of the genus Lophius, also sometimes called monkfish, fishing-frogs, frog-fish, and sea-devils, are various species of lophiid anglerfishes found in the Atlantic and Indian Oceans. Lophius is known as the "monk" or "monkfish" to the North Sea fishermen, a name which also belongs to Squatina squatina, the angelshark, a type of shark. The North European species is Lophius piscatorius, and the Mediterranean species is Lophius budegassa.
Species [ edit ]
The seven recognized extant species in this genus are:[2]
Description [ edit ]
The head is large, broad, flat, and depressed, with the remainder of the body appearing merely like an appendage. The wide mouth extends all around the anterior circumference of the head, and both jaws are armed with bands of long, pointed teeth, which are inclined inwards, and can be temporarily depressed so as to offer no impediment to an object gliding towards the stomach, while still preventing its escape from the mouth. The pectoral and ventral fins are so articulated as to perform the functions of feet, the fish being enabled to walk on the bottom of the sea, where it generally hides itself in the sand or amongst seaweed. All around its head and also along the body, the skin bears fringed appendages resembling short fronds of seaweed. These structures, combined with the ability to change the colour of the body to match its surroundings, assist the fish greatly in concealing itself in its lurking places, which are selected for their abundance of prey.[citation needed]
Species of Lophius have three long filaments sprouting from the middle of their heads; these are the detached and modified three first spines of the anterior dorsal fin. As with all anglerfish species, the longest filament is the first, which terminates in an irregular growth of flesh, the esca (also referred to as the illicium), and is movable in all directions; this modified fin ray is used as a lure to attract other fish, which the monkfish then seize with their enormous jaws, devouring them whole. Whether the prey has been attracted to the lure or not is not strictly relevant, as the action of the jaws is an automatic reflex triggered by contact with the esca.[citation needed]
Monkfish, like most anglerfish, are also characterised by an enormously distensible stomach, which allows an individual monkfish to fully swallow prey as large as itself.[3][4] Monkfish grow to a length of more than 150 cm (4.9 ft); specimens of 100 cm (3.3 ft) are common.[citation needed]
Reproduction [ edit ]
The spawn of this genus consists of a thin sheet of transparent gelatinous material 60–100 cm (2.0–3.3 ft) wide and 8–10 m (26–33 ft) in length. The eggs in this sheet are in a single layer, each in its own little cavity. The spawn is free in the sea. The larvae are free-swimming and have the pelvic fins with elongated filaments.[citation needed]
Habitat [ edit ]
The East Atlantic species is found along the coasts of Europe, but becomes scarce beyond 60°N latitude; it occurs also on the coasts of the Cape of Good Hope. The species caught on the North American side of the Atlantic is usually Lophius americanus. A third species (Lophius budegassa), inhabits the Mediterranean, and a fourth (L. setigerus) the coasts of China and Japan.[citation needed]
The black (L. budegassa) and white (L. piscatorius) anglerfish both live in shallow, inshore waters from 800 metres (2,600 ft) to deeper waters (greater than 1,000 metres, 3,300 ft).[5] These two species are very similar to one another with only a few distinctions between them. These include: the colour of the peritoneum (black for L. budegassa and white for L. piscatorius) and the number of rays in the second dorsal fin (L. budegassa, 9–10 and L. piscatorius, 11–12).[6] Also, minor differences in their distribution occur. Black anglerfish tend to have a more southern distribution (Mediterranean and eastern North Atlantic from the British Isles to Senegal), whereas the white anglerfish are distributed further north, (Mediterranean, Black Sea and eastern North Atlantic from the Barents Sea to the Strait of Gibraltar).[6] Despite these differences, the overall distribution of the black and white anglerfish tend to overlap greatly.[6] A map of the distribution of anglerfish in the waters surrounding Europe and North Africa can be found in the external links section. The movements of both species of anglerfish indicate a mixing of both northern and southern species could have strong implications for the geographical boundaries of the stocks from a management perspective.[5] Both species of Lophius are important because they are commercially valuable species usually caught by trawl and gillnetting fleets.[5]
Concern is expressed over the sustainability of monkfish fishing.[7] The method most commonly used to catch monkfish, beam trawling, has been described as damaging to seafloor habitats. In February 2007, the British supermarket chain Asda banned monkfish from their stores.[8]

A couple of weeks ago, I wrote a post on what every undergraduate physics major ought to learn over their four years, giving a sketch of the bare minimum of curricular content. In response to that, Doug Natelson offered an aspirational list of things we'd like everyone to know about physics. This is an excellent follow-on question, and Doug's list is a good one, though as a blogger I am, of course, obliged to take a completely different approach...
This is, of course, a difficult question to answer as an academic, because as somebody who's spent the last twenty-mumble years making a living doing physics, there's an enormous list of specific physics content that I find important and useful. There's a wealth of material just in classical physics that would be helpful for everyone to know. Newton's Laws of mechanics, and the follow-on ideas of energy, momentum, and angular momentum conservation are extremely useful for understanding what goes on in any number of everyday situations, which can enrich your life even if you don't get any practical use out of it-- I regularly plug Rhett Allain's blogging for Wired, for example, and his video analyses are an excellent example of this. You're probably not actually going to do any of the tricks and stunts he breaks down, but it's fun knowing how those things work all the same.
Sticking in the classical world, electricity and magnetism is an extremely useful subject, as well, with enormous practical importance. Understanding a bit about how electric circuits work can be really important for everyday tasks. And, of course, E&M leads into classical optics, and there's great benefit to understanding a bit about the nature and behavior of light, and the formation of images by lenses, and so on.
Getting slightly more esoteric, there are quite a few scams and delusions that could be dispensed with if more people had a decent grasp of thermodynamics, particularly the bits about entropy as a limit on what can be achieved with engines. I'm not sure that I'd call Boltzmann's statistical view of entropy a subject of great practical importance, but it's certainly a deep and powerful idea that can be very satisfying to know. And, of course, there's any number of things to be said about quantum physics-- enough of them, in fact, that I'm in the process of writing a whole book on how quantum phenomena manifest in everyday life.
Of course, all that factual knowledge is kind of a lot to expect people to keep track of, let alone to invest the time in learning in the first place. You can pack a lot of it into a "Physics for Poets" survey course, but those tend not to go over all that well. These days, a lot of science classes for non-majors tend to focus on a specific set of topics and teach the science associated with those, rather than trying a survey of everything. So, as a professor, I'm tempted to call for a lot of specific content knowledge, but I also know enough to realize that's a bad route to go.
As an alternative, you could try to distill things down, to find a single topic or short statement that embeds the maximum amount of physics content. This is a valuable approach (and basically the spirit behind the more topic-driven non-majors courses). But as practical matter of writing, it's really hard to do better than the famous opening of the Feynman Lectures:
If, in some cataclysm, all of scientific knowledge were to be destroyed, and only one sentence passed on to the next generations of creatures, what statement would contain the most information in the fewest words? I believe it is the atomic hypothesis (or the atomic fact, or whatever you wish to call it) that all things are made of atoms—little particles that move around in perpetual motion, attracting each other when they are a little distance apart, but repelling upon being squeezed into one another. In that one sentence, you will see, there is an enormous amount of information about the world, if just a little imagination and thinking are applied.
It's really hard to do better than that. So I'm not even going to attempt to find a better one-sentence encapsulation of all physics.
The other tactic to use in approaching this sort of problem is to go after the practice of physics, to try to find some thing(s) that physicists do that everyone should know. And, indeed, the first five bullet points on Natelson's list linked above are in this general vein.
This sort of information is critical, but a lot of the practice-of-physics stuff that comes to mind isn't all that specific to physics, but rather reflects the process of science in general. Careful observation, hypothesis testing, trust in empirical evidence-- all of those are general scientific habits that can serve everyone well. (And to a greater extent than most people realize, they do serve everyone well-- most of the mental processes used in science have analogues in other activities, so even people who don't think they know or like science make use of scientific thinking. But that's a whole book length argument that I'm not going to push too far here...)
The one practice from physics that I think is somewhat specific to the discipline (at least, physicists seem to do it more than most) is the use of highly approximate models. There's a lot of truth to the old joke about a physicist who offers advice on dairy farming that starts out "First, we assume a spherical cow..."
While it's a little easy to mock, though, there's a good deal of power in this kind of simplification, in finding models that strip complicated systems down to a handful of extremely general principles that capture most of what's going on. It's certainly possible to oversimplify things, but there's also a kind of paralysis that comes from too much concern with complexity. When you're faced with a complicated problem, it can seem impossible to even start to address things, but in a lot of cases, you can find a simple model approach that captures most of what's going on, and refine it from there. You make an approximation that isn't perfect, but it gives you a place to start, and you can then add back complication a bit at a time until your model is as good as you need it to be.
This idea of refining approximations is in some sense built into the very structure of physics. Newtonian mechanics is, strictly speaking, not a correct theory of how the universe works, but it's an outstanding approximation over a wide range of parameters. As you start looking at smaller things, low-energy quantum physics becomes a factor, but the Schrodinger equation, strictly speaking, isn't any more correct than Newton's Laws. It's an excellent starting point, though, and captures a huge amount of what's going on. If you need to do better, there's the Dirac equation (correcting for special relativity), and QED, and so on. Most of the models we use in physics are technically not correct, but they're good enough for the situations in which we use them.
There's no small amount of art to this, of course-- figuring out what's really essential and what can safely be approximated away is a hard problem, and the cause of endless arguments among physicists. It's also important to know that your approximate models have limits, and not to push them too far-- this is the signature failure mode of a lot of economics. The idea that it's okay to have models that are only approximate, though, offers a great deal of freedom, and it's something that could be used a bit more widely. (For example, consider one of the greatest paper titles of all time, which is to some extent a call for more physicist-y behavior in sociology...)
So, I think that if there's one thing non-scientists should learn from physics specifically, it would be that the best way to start solving a complicated problem is to think about how to make it look like a simpler problem, and what you would do to solve that. If you start out trying to account for every hair on the cow, you'll never get anywhere, but "consider a spherical cow..." can get you started, and lead to results that are good enough.

Tra mercatini innevati e primi piani sorridenti dalla Piazza Rossa, la scorsa settimana il segretario della Lega Nord Matteo Salvini è volato per l'ennesima volta – la quarta in un solo anno – a Mosca.
La circostanza non è sfuggita al premier Matteo Renzi, che nel corso di un'intervista televisiva lo ha attaccato frontalmente: "Gli europarlamentari degli altri paesi sono sempre lì a lavorare. Se uno sta mattina e sera a pontificare in tv o a fare i viaggetti in Russia, fa il suo interesse ma non quello degli italiani."
Naturalmente, la reazione di Salvini non si è fatta attendere. In uno status sulla sua pagina Facebook, il leader leghista ha definito Renzi un "bugiardo chiacchierone" e ha invitato il presidente del Consiglio a fare di persona un "viaggetto" in Russia "sul tuo nuovo aereo da 200 milioni di dollari" per andare "a scuola di buongoverno."
Stando a quanto riportato dalla stampa, Salvini in Russia avrebbe fatto una "cena privata" con imprenditori non meglio specificati, e incontrato alcuni esponenti del partito Russia Unita come Aleksei Pushkov (presidente della commissione Esteri della Duma) e Andrei Klimov (responsabile esteri del partito).
Contrariamente a quanto annunciato dallo stesso Salvini, tuttavia, l'incontro con Vladimir Putin non c'è stato. A tale proposito, qualcuno si è spinto a parlare di un "amore più monodirezionale che corrisposto."
In effetti, ci sono pochi dubbi sul fatto che da due anni a questa parte Matteo Salvini – e più in generale una buona parte della Lega Nord – consideri il presidente russo come il punto di riferimento assoluto nello scacchiere geopolitico, e la Russia odierna come una specie di nuova Padania.
Tra le miriadi di dichiarazioni in merito, e solo negli ultimi tempi, Salvini ha fatto sapere di ammirare Putin per "le idee chiare, la fermezza, il coraggio, l'interventismo e una visione della società basata su punti cardine che condivido"; ha proposto di cedere "due Mattarella in cambio di mezzo Putin;" e ha detto di sentirsi "più sicuro" se "l'Italia avesse un Putin e non un Renzi."
Insomma, l'infatuazione per Vladimir Putin non solo è plateale, ma è ormai diventata uno dei tratti caratteristici della Lega salviniana. L'obiettivo non potrebbe essere più chiaro: quello di diventare il referente italiano per la Russia.

A tale proposito, già da tempo la Lega Nord si è dotata di una struttura apposita. La più in vista è l'associazione culturale "apartitica" LombardiaRussia, che funge da cinghia di trasmissione politico-imprenditoriale tra il partito e la Russia.
Nel sito dell'associazione è esplicitato che le loro idee "combaciano pienamente con la visione del mondo enunciata dal Presidente della Federazione Russa nel corso del meeting di Valdai 2013 e che si possono riassumere in tre parole: Identità, Sovranità, Tradizione."
La Russia, si legge ancora, è oggi "l'unico baluardo e l'unico faro verso cui guardare con speranza." E Putin, già che ci siamo, potrebbe anche essere immortale.
Il presidente di LombardiaRussia è Gianluca Savoini, ex giornalista de La Padania e portavoce di Matteo Salvini. Soprannominato il "Cosacco della Lega," il leghista è convinto che il "Tramonto dell'Occidente di Spengler è già avanzato," e che l'Europa intera sia "al buio pesto, alla notte profonda." Vista questa situazione, la risposta può essere solo una: Vladimir Putin.
"Putin è la cattiva coscienza per l'Occidente," ha spiegato Savoini in una recente intervista. "È quello che l'Europa non è: decisionismo, difesa del proprio interesse nazionale, patriottismo, difesa dell'identità, della storia, della religione cristiana." E per vedere da vicino questa "risorgenza della Russia imperiale," lo stesso Savoini ha comunicato ad un giornale russo di recarsi una volta al mese in Russia per incontrare esponenti del partito di Putin e imprenditori vari.

LombardiaRussia è affiancata anche da diversi equivalenti locali. Tra questi ci sono UmbriaRussia e LazioRussia, che lo scorso 28 novembre – insieme ad altre sigle riconducibili all'estrema destra come il Fronte Europeo per la Siria – hanno portato sostegno all'ambasciata russa a Roma dopo l'abbattimento del jet da parte della Turchia.
Descritta sui social come una "grande manifestazione popolare," in realtà c'erano appena qualche decina di persone e militanti di partiti d'estrema destra alleati con la Lega Nord. Del resto, il portavoce di LazioRussia è Mauro Antonini di CasaPound, che lavora anche come assistente di Mario Borghezio all'Europarlamento. In piazza era presente anche Irina Osipova, una studentessa russa che è presidente del movimento dei Giovani Italo-Russi (RIM) di Roma ed è particolarmente attiva nel fare da ponte tra i movimenti dell'estrema destra italiana e quelli russi.
(Irina Osipova è la seconda da sinistra; Mauro Antonini è l'ultimo a destra. Foto via Facebook.)
Tuttavia, a unire le varie anime filo-russe della Lega Nord non è solamente l'ammirazione per Putin: sono soprattutto le idee del filosofo russo Aleksandr Dugin, ideologo del neo-eurasiatismo, promotore della "Quarta Teoria Politica" (spiegata dalla stesso in una recente intervista a Il Giornale) e descritto dalla stampa internazionale come il "cervello di Putin."
Come ha ricostruito il ricercatore italiano Giovanni Savino nel saggio Eurasianism and the European Far Right, le teorie di Dugin circolano negli ambienti neofascisti e rossobruni italiani almeno dagli anni Novanta. Ora, grazie alla confluenza tra questi ambienti e il progetto politico di Matteo Salvini, il filosofo russo è diventato un intellettuale di riferimento della Lega Nord, che l'ha nominato presidente onorario di PiemonteRussia e - solo tra il 2014 e il 2015 - l'ha portato in Italia per ben quattro volte.
Finora, questa considerazione è stata ampiamente ripagata. Lo scorso giugno – ai margini della presentazione a Milano del saggio La rinascita di un Impero – La Russia di Vladimir Putin – Dugin ha apertamente elogiato Matteo Salvini, definendolo "l'unico politico che può rappresentare gli interessi reali degli italiani."
Alla fine di questo novembre, inoltre, Dugin è stato relatore di un corso dell'Accademia di formazione politica della Lega Nord che si è tenuto ad Assago. "Noi in Russia e voi in Europa," ha dichiarato il filosofo russo, "ci battiamo contro ogni pensiero unico e contro la volontà del mondialismo da un lato e dell'estremismo islamico dall'altro di distruggere le tradizioni e le identità dei popoli."
(Alexandr Dugin insieme a Gianluigi Savoini a Milano, giugno 2015. Foto via Facebook.)
Secondo Giovanni Savino, dunque, l'adozione di queste istanze da parte della Lega Nord può offrire la "possibilità di monopolizzare" una porzione ben precisa dello "spettro ideologico" della destra italiana; sul versante esterno, invece, un'operazione del genere è condotta per accreditarsi politicamente presso le autorità russe.
Del resto, come aveva descritto il paper The Russian Connection pubblicato nel 2014, "la nuova strategia geopolitica della Russia coincide con la piattaforma politica anti-establishment dell'estrema destra europea." E il Cremlino, proprio in questi ultimi anni, si è mostrato particolarmente interessato ad appoggiare determinati soggetti—e non solo da un punto di vista politico e mediatico.
Come ha portato alla luce un'inchiesta del giornale francese Mediapart dell'anno scorso, il Front National ha ricevuto un finanziamento di nove milioni di euro dalla First Czech Russian Bank, un istituto bancario di proprietà di un "uomo vicino al premier Medvedev e al presidente Putin."
Nel solco di queste rivelazioni, sulla stampa italiana si è cominciato a dubitare della "genuinità" politica della svolta putiniana della Lega Nord. Secondo alcuni retroscena – mai confermati – Salvini avrebbe chiesto a Berlusconi di intercedere per ottenere l'"oro di Mosca," necessario a rimpinguare le esangui casse del partito.
Altri, come L'Espresso, sostengono invece che i soldi non sarebbero mai arrivati addirittura per "l'inaspettato rifiuto leghista," dovuto principalmente ai rapporti decennali con gli Stati Uniti di alcuni importanti esponenti della Lega Nord. Savoini ha comunque smentito tutto, sostenendo che "mai da parte di Matteo Salvini, del sottoscritto o di qualunque altro dirigente della Lega Nord è stato chiesto un sostegno finanziario al Cremlino o al governo della Federazione Russa, nè mai verrà chiesto in futuro."
Lo stesso Matteo Salvini ha detto di non aver "mai visto un centesimo e mai parlato di queste cose con i russi," pur ammettendo che "un prestito conveniente come quello concesso alla Le Pen lo accetterei volentieri."
Per ora, in attesa di essere considerato seriamente da Vladimir Putin, il segretario leghista deve accontentarsi di indossare t-shirt elogiative, presentare libri sulla vita dello "Zar" e scattare selfie nella metropolitana di Mosca.

Cross-posted from Kochology, where Daniel Schulman is releasing exclusive documents and other materials gathered in the process of reporting his new book Sons of Wichita: How the Koch Brothers Became America's Most Powerful and Private Dynasty.
Long before Charles Koch became the left's public enemy number one (or two, depending on where David Koch falls in the rankings), some of his most vocal detractors were not liberals but fellow libertarians. None of his erstwhile allies would come to loathe him more fiercely than Murray Rothbard, one of the movement's intellectual forefathers, with whom Charles had worked closely to elevate libertarianism from a fringy cadre of radical thinkers to a genuine and growing mass movement.
In the 1970s, Charles helped fund Rothbard's work, as the economist churned out treatise after treatise denouncing the tyranny of government. Rothbard was a man with a plan when it came to movement-building. Where some libertarians had bickered over whether to advance the cause through an academic or an activist approach, Rothbard argued that the solution wasn't to choose one path, but both. Charles was taken with his strategic vision.
Rothbard dreamt of creating a libertarian think tank to bolster the movement's intellectual capacity. Charles Koch made this a reality in 1977, when he co-founded the Cato Institute with Rothbard and Ed Crane, then the chairman of the national Libertarian Party. This was a high point for libertarianism, when a busy hive of libertarian organizing buzzed on San Francisco's Montgomery Street, home to Cato and a handful of other ideological operations bankrolled by Charles Koch.
But the relationship between Cato's co-founders soon soured.
“Charles Koch has a practice of misusing nonprofit foundations for his own personal ends. He wants to spend that money on things that will enhance his personal image and goals, even it these expenditures are not consistent with the publicly stated goals of the foundation.”
Rothbard, who was feisty by nature, chafed under the regime of Crane and Koch—the libertarian movement's primary financier at that time. His breaking point came during the 1980 election, when David Koch ran as the Libertarian Party's vice presidential nominee. Rothbard and his supporters felt that, in a bid for national legitimacy, David Koch and his running mate, Ed Clark, had watered down the core tenets of libertarianism to make their philosophy more palatable to the masses. Americans today would consider their platform—which called for abolishing Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid and eliminating federal agencies including the EPA and the Department of Energy—a radical one. But to Rothbard and his circle, it wasn't radical enough. For instance, the Clark-Koch ticket stopped short of calling for the outright repeal of the income tax. And Clark, to Rothbard's horror, had even defined libertarianism as “low-tax liberalism” in a TV interview.
Following the 1980 election, in which the Clark-Koch campaign claimed a little over one percent of the popular vote, Rothbard did not hold back. He penned a scathing polemic titled “The Clark Campaign: Never Again,” in which he wrote that Ed Clark and David Koch had “sold their souls—ours, unfortunately, along with it—for a mess of pottage, and they didn't even get the pottage.” Thanks in part to Rothbard's rabble-rousing, factional feuds and recriminations splintered the libertarian movement just as it was gaining momentum. A few months after Rothbard's diatribe, Charles Koch and Ed Crane tossed him out of the Cato Institute and voided his shares in the think tank (which was set up, under Kansas law, as a nonprofit corporation with stockholders), a rebuke that turned their libertarian brother-in-arms into a lifelong adversary.
Rothbard would later play a cameo role in the messy battle between the four Koch brothers. In 1988, when Bill and Frederick Koch sued their brothers over control of the family foundation that had been established by their father, they dredged up Rothbard as a possible witness, seeking to depose him in the case. They hoped his testimony would damage Charles Koch's credibility and support their contention that their brother was a tyrannical control freak who used nonprofit entities to advance his own aims.
A document summarizing Rothbard's anticipated testimony was filed in the case, and I came across it as I pored over thousands of documents at the district court house in the Koch family's hometown of Wichita. Rothbard, it seemed, was only too eager to denounce his onetime benefactor.
Charles Koch, Rothbard planned to testify, “involves himself in the minutest details related to the non-profit foundations with which he is associated…. He insists on personally approving even the minutest matters, such as $100 grants, stationery design and color of offices.” Rothbard contended that Charles would go “to any end to acquire/retain control over the nonprofit foundations with which he is associated” and “considers himself above the law.” And the economist further alleged:
Charles Koch has a practice of misusing nonprofit foundations for his own personal ends. Charles Koch wants absolute control of the non-profit foundations, but wants to be able to spend other people's money not his own. He wants to spend that money on things that will enhance his personal image and goals, even it these expenditures are not consistent with the publicly stated goals of the foundation. Amongst other things, Charles Koch uses his involvement with non-profit foundations to aquire access to, and respect from, influential people in government and elsewhere.
Rothbard died in 1995, taking his grudge to the grave. By then, Charles and David Koch had abandoned the libertarian movement and struck out on their long path to becoming Republican powerbrokers. As their influence has expanded within the broader GOP in recent years, I've heard echoes of Rothbard's past criticisms in the conservative nonprofit world by recipients of Koch network funding who complain of micromanagement by the Koch brothers' political adjutants. “Nobody really works with them,” said the leader of one conservative group. “They work for them or not at all. They are kind of creating a monopoly” and attempting to “make the conservative movement theirs.”

In most industries, it's easy to identify innovators.
But it's rare to hear of a new and disruptive health care provider that has made something better, faster, or cheaper. Why is that?
In short, it's because health care is a uniquely uncompetitive market.
Take price visibility - when consumers can compare prices, it forces businesses to compete. But in health care, you almost never know what you owe until after a service has been performed.
The most important driver of revolutions in price and quality, comes from NEW companies entering a market.
But we've passed thousands of laws and regulations that make it next to impossible for new competitors to offer medical services at a lower cost.
For example, health care providers in 35 states must obtain “certificates of need” in order to open a new hospital or clinic, or even make major purchases. But the boards that grant them permission explicitly protect existing providers, at the expense of new competition.
The rules that regulate the provision of health care are set up to prevent new and innovative companies from offering better, more cost effective services.
If we want a revolution in health care, we should think more about expanding supply.
And to do that, we need to identify and eliminate the restrictions that prevent new entrants to the market.

15th-century King of England and one of the Princes in the Tower
Edward V (2 November 1470 – c. 1483)[1] succeeded his father, Edward IV, as King of England and Lord of Ireland[2] upon the latter's death on 9 April 1483. He was never crowned, and his brief reign was dominated by the influence of his uncle and Lord Protector, the Duke of Gloucester, who deposed him to reign as Richard III on 26 June 1483; this was confirmed by the Act entitled Titulus Regius, which denounced any further claims through his father's heirs.
Edward and his younger brother Richard of Shrewsbury, Duke of York, were the Princes in the Tower who disappeared after being sent to heavily guarded royal lodgings in the Tower of London. Responsibility for their deaths is widely attributed to Richard III, but the lack of any solid evidence and conflicting contemporary accounts also suggest other possible suspects.
Early life [ edit ]
Edward was born on 2 November 1470 in Cheyneygates, the medieval house of the Abbot of Westminster. His mother, Elizabeth Woodville, had sought sanctuary there from Lancastrians who had deposed his father, the Yorkist King Edward IV, during the course of the Wars of the Roses. Edward was created Prince of Wales in June 1471, following Edward IV's restoration to the throne, and in 1473 was established at Ludlow Castle on the Welsh Marches as nominal president of a newly created Council of Wales and the Marches. In 1479, his father conferred the earldom of Pembroke on him; it became merged into the crown on his succession.[3]
Prince Edward was placed under the supervision of the queen's brother Anthony, Earl Rivers, a noted scholar, and in a letter to Rivers, Edward IV set down precise conditions for the upbringing of his son and the management of his household.[4] The prince was to "arise every morning at a convenient hour, according to his age". His day would begin with matins and then Mass, which he was to receive uninterrupted. After breakfast, the business of educating the prince began with "virtuous learning". Dinner was served from ten in the morning, and then the prince was to be read "noble stories ... of virtue, honour, cunning, wisdom, and of deeds of worship" but "of nothing that should move or stir him to vice". Perhaps aware of his own vices, the king was keen to safeguard his son's morals, and instructed Rivers to ensure that no one in the prince's household was a habitual "swearer, brawler, backbiter, common hazarder, adulterer, [or user of] words of ribaldry". After further study, in the afternoon the prince was to engage in sporting activities suitable for his class, before evensong. Supper was served from four, and curtains were to be drawn at eight. Following this, the prince's attendants were to "enforce themselves to make him merry and joyous towards his bed". They would then watch over him as he slept.
King Edward's diligence appeared to bear fruit, as Dominic Mancini reported of the young Edward V:
In word and deed he gave so many proofs of his liberal education, of polite nay rather scholarly, attainments far beyond his age; ... his special knowledge of literature ... enabled him to discourse elegantly, to understand fully, and to declaim most excellently from any work whether in verse or prose that came into his hands, unless it were from the more abstruse authors. He had such dignity in his whole person, and in his face such charm, that however much they might gaze, he never wearied the eyes of beholders.[5]
As with several of his other children, Edward IV planned a prestigious European marriage for his eldest son, and in 1480 concluded an alliance with the Duke of Brittany, Francis II, whereby Prince Edward was betrothed to the duke's four-year-old heir, Anne. The two were to be married upon their majority, and the devolution of Brittany would have been given to the second child to be born, the first becoming Prince of Wales. Those plans disappeared together with Edward V.
Reign [ edit ]
It was at Ludlow that the 12-year-old prince received news, on Monday 14 April 1483, of his father's sudden death five days before. Edward IV's will, which has not survived, nominated his trusted brother Richard, Duke of Gloucester, as Protector during the minority of his son. Both the new king and his party from the west, and Richard from the north, set out for London, converging in Stony Stratford, Buckinghamshire.[6] On the night of 29 April Richard met and dined with Earl Rivers and Edward's half-brother, Richard Grey, but the following morning Rivers and Grey, along with the king's chamberlain, Thomas Vaughan, were arrested and sent north.[7] They were all subsequently executed. Dominic Mancini, an Italian who visited England in the 1480s, reports that Edward protested, but the remainder of his entourage was dismissed and Richard escorted him to London. On 19 May 1483, the new king took up residence in the Tower of London, where, on 16 June, he was joined by his younger brother Richard, Duke of York.[8]
The council had originally hoped for an immediate coronation to avoid the need for a protectorate. This had previously happened with Richard II, who had become king at the age of ten. Another precedent was Henry VI whose protectorate (which started when he inherited the crown aged 9 months) had ended with his coronation aged seven. Richard, however, repeatedly postponed the coronation.[9]
On 22 June, Ralph Shaa preached a sermon declaring that Edward IV had already been contracted to marry Lady Eleanor Butler when he married Elizabeth Woodville, thereby rendering his marriage to Elizabeth invalid and their children together illegitimate.[9] The children of Richard's older brother George, Duke of Clarence, were barred from the throne by their father's attainder, and therefore, on 25 June, an assembly of Lords and Commons declared Richard to be the legitimate king (this was later confirmed by the act of parliament Titulus Regius). The following day he acceded to the throne as King Richard III.
Disappearance [ edit ]

Dominic Mancini recorded that after Richard III seized the throne, Edward and his younger brother Richard were taken into the "inner apartments of the Tower" and then were seen less and less until the end of the summer of 1483, when they disappeared from public view altogether. During this period Mancini records that Edward was regularly visited by a doctor, who reported that Edward, "like a victim prepared for sacrifice, sought remission of his sins by daily confession and penance, because he believed that death was facing him."[10] The Latin reference to Argentinus medicus had previously been translated to mean "a Strasbourg doctor", because in Roman times Strasbourg was called Argentoratum; however, D.E. Rhodes suggests it may actually refer to "Doctor Argentine", whom Rhodes identifies as John Argentine, an English physician who would later serve as provost of King's College, Cambridge, and as doctor to Arthur, Prince of Wales, the eldest son of King Henry VII of England (Henry Tudor).[8]
Edward and his brother Richard's fate after their disappearance remains unknown, but the most widely accepted theory is that they were murdered on the orders of their uncle, King Richard.[2] Thomas More wrote that the princes were smothered to death with their pillows, and his account forms the basis of William Shakespeare's play Richard III, in which Tyrrell murders the princes on Richard's orders. Subsequent re-evaluations of Richard III have questioned his guilt, beginning with William Cornwallis early in the 17th century.[11] In the period before the boys' disappearance, Edward was regularly being visited by a doctor; historian David Baldwin extrapolates that contemporaries may have believed Edward had died of an illness (or as the result of attempts to cure him).[12] In the absence of hard evidence a number of other theories have been put forward, of which the most widely discussed are that they were murdered on the orders of the Duke of Buckingham or by Henry Tudor. However, Pollard points out that these theories are less plausible than the straightforward one that they were murdered by their uncle[13] who in any case controlled access to them and was therefore regarded as responsible for their welfare.[14] An alternative theory is that Perkin Warbeck, who claimed to be a pretender to the throne, was indeed Richard of Shrewsbury, Duke of York as he claimed, having escaped to Flanders after his uncle's defeat at Bosworth to be raised with an aunt.
Bones belonging to two children were discovered in 1674 by workmen rebuilding a stairway in the Tower. On the orders of King Charles II, these were subsequently placed in Westminster Abbey, in an urn bearing the names of Edward and Richard.[15] The bones were reexamined in 1933, at which time it was discovered the skeletons were incomplete and had been interred with animal bones. It has never been proven that the bones belonged to the princes, and it is possible that they were buried before the reconstruction of that part of the Tower of London.[16] Permission for a subsequent examination has been refused.
In 1789, workmen carrying out repairs in St George's Chapel, Windsor, rediscovered and accidentally broke into the vault of Edward IV and Elizabeth Woodville. Adjoining this was another vault, which was found to contain the coffins of two children. This tomb was inscribed with the names of two of Edward IV's children: George, 1st Duke of Bedford, who had died at the age of 2; and Mary of York, who had died at the age of 14. Both had died before the King. However, the remains of these two children were later found elsewhere in the chapel, leaving the occupants of the children's coffins within the tomb unknown.[17]
In 1486 Edward IV's daughter Elizabeth, sister of Edward V, married Henry VII, thereby uniting the Houses of York and Lancaster.
Epitaph [ edit ]
As outlined above, on the orders of Charles II, the presumed bones of Edward V (and his brother) were interred in Westminster Abbey; he was thus buried in the place of his birth. The white marble sarcophagus was designed by Sir Christopher Wren and made by Joshua Marshall. The sarcophagus can be found in the north aisle of the Henry VII Chapel, near Elizabeth I's tomb.
The Latin inscription on the urn can be translated as follows:
Here lie the relics of Edward V, King of England, and Richard, Duke of York. These brothers being confined in the Tower of London, and there stifled with pillows, were privately and meanly buried, by the order of their perfidious uncle Richard the Usurper; their bones, long enquired after and wished for, after 191 years in the rubbish of the stairs (those lately leading to the Chapel of the White Tower) were on the 17th day of July AD 1674 by undoubted proofs discovered, being buried deep in that place. Charles II, a most compassionate king, pitying their severe fate, ordered these unhappy princes to be laid amongst the monuments of their predecessors, AD 1678, in the 30th year of his reign.[18]
The original Latin text is as follows (original all in capitals):[19]

Portrayals in fiction [ edit ]
Edward appears as a character in the play Richard III by William Shakespeare. Edward appears alive in only one scene of the play (Act 3 Scene 1), during which he and his brother are portrayed as bright, precocious children who see through their uncle's ambitions. Edward in particular is portrayed as wiser than his years (something his uncle notes) and ambitious about his kingship. Edward and his brother's deaths are described in the play, but occur offstage. Their ghosts return in one more scene (Act 5 Scene 3) to haunt their uncle's dreams and promise success to his rival, Richmond. In film and television adaptations of this play, Edward V has been portrayed by the following actors:
Edward V is also featured as a mute role in another of Shakespeare's plays, Henry VI, Part 3, where he appears as a newborn baby in the final scene. His father Edward IV addresses his own brothers thus: "Clarence, and Gloster, love my lovely queen, And kiss your princely nephew, brothers both." Gloster, the future Richard III, is at the close of this play already encompassing his nephew's demise, as he mutters in an aside, "To say the truth, so Judas kiss'd his master, And cried – All hail! when as he meant – all harm."[20]
