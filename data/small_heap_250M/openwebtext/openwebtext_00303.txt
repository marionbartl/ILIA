During election seasons the words left and right denote political affiliation more than spatial direction. But where do these associations come from?
The left hand has long been associated with deviance. The word “sinister” originally meant “to the left” in Latin. The word “left” comes from the Old English word lyft, which literally meant “weak, foolish.” To avoid the negative and superstitious associations of the left side, many languages used euphemisms for it. In Old English the left side was called winestra, which meant “friendlier.” In Greek it was called aristeros or “the better one.”
When did the political affiliation of these two common words arise? In fact, the association isn't American at all—it originated during the French Revolution. In the 1790s, King Louis XVI was fighting with the Legislative Assembly. Like our modern-day House of Representatives, seating in the French Legislative Assembly was arranged based on political affiliation. The King sat in front of the assembly. To his right sat the conservative Feuillants who backed the king and believed in a constitutional monarchy. To his left sat the liberal Girondists and radical Jacobins who wanted to install a completely democratic government. Oddly enough, in the U.S. House of Representatives the tables have turned: members of the Republican party sit to the left of the House Speaker and members of the Democratic party sit to his or her right.
It wasn't until the early twentieth century that Left and Right denoted political affiliation in Britain and the U.S., and according to Google's NGram viewer, the more politically loaded terms “leftwing” and “rightwing” were not widely used until after 1960.
Egypt's chief prosecutor on Wednesday ordered the transfer of former President Hosni Mubarak from a Cairo military hospital back to prison. Mr. Mubarak is expected to be held there pending a retrial on charges including complicity in the killing of protesters during the 2011 revolt that toppled him. He had been in the hospital since December after injuring himself during a fall in the prison shower, his lawyers said. The prosecutor ordered the transfer after Mr. Mubarak appeared Saturday in a Cairo courtroom, where, despite being on a gurney, the former president appeared in good health and high spirits, waving to supporters. A medical board subsequently ruled that Mr. Mubarak was well enough to be sent back to prison. A judge scheduled May 11 as the date for the new trial.
Mother daughter shot to death in Pueblo West
Pueblo West Suspicious Deaths Authorities discover 2 people & 2 dogs dead at Pueblo West home
PUEBLO WEST, Colo. - The Colorado Department of Corrections has confirmed that one of its employees was among the two people found dead in her Pueblo West home on Monday.
Jennifer Hamula, 42, was an employee with the DOC since 1997 and was currently working at the state penitentiary in Canon City.
Her body was found late Monday afternoon in the 1000 block of Mescal Drive, alongside her daughter, Stephie Hamula, 10, and two dead dogs.
According to the Pueblo County coroner's report, the mother and daughter suffered gunshot wounds but pending autopsy results will determine the official cause and manner of the deaths.
Authorities did not explain how the dogs died.
A man who identified himself as Jennifer's uncle spoke with KRDO NewsChannel 13 off-camera Tuesday.
The uncle, who declined to provide his name, said the Hamulas moved from Cotopaxi in Fremont County to Pueblo West earlier this summer to get away from domestic trouble with her husband.
Jennifer was a Pueblo native, the uncle said.

Neighbors said they didn't know the family and hadn't met them.
"I didn't know a child was living there," said Carmen Lucero, the family's nearest neighbor. "That makes it worse."
Investigators said there is no threat to the public but have yet to identify a suspect or motive.
“This is a very tragic situation. Our thoughts and prayers go out to the family and friends of the deceased. We will continue to follow the evidence to determine the sequence of events and the circumstances surrounding these tragic deaths,” said Pueblo County Sheriff Kirk M. Taylor.

France and Turkey are heading toward a showdown this Thursday, as France moved to make denial of the Armenian genocide a crime punishable by a 45,000-euro fine and a year in jail – and an apoplexic Turkey threatened to retaliate if the sensitive matter was dealt with in this fashion
.
This proposed law targets and is hostile to the Republic of Turkey, the Turkish nation and the Turkish community living in France," Turkish Prime Minister Tayyip Erdoğan wrote in a tersely worded letter to President Nicolas Sarkozy last week.
I want to state clearly that such steps will have grave consequences for future relations between Turkey and France in political, economic, cultural and all areas," he said.
Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan speaks to the media with a portrait of modern Turkey's founder Kemal Ataturk in the background, in Ankara, Turkey, Thursday, Oct. 20, 2011. AP
Back in Turkey, Erdoğan has gone further, threatening to raise Frances own dirty and bloody history in Algeria and Rwanda and take all kinds of diplomatic action in response to the bill, which will be brought to parliament for a vote Thursday.
Armenia, backed by many historians and parliaments, says some 1.5 million Christian Armenians were killed in what is now eastern Turkey during World War One in a deliberate policy of genocide ordered by the Ottoman Empire.
But the terming of this 1915 mass killing as genocide has long been a very touchy matter in Turkey, where the majority feel the charge is an insult and unfair. Ankara claim is that many Muslim Turks and Kurds were also put to death as Russian troops invaded eastern Anatolia, often aided by Armenian militias.
The Turks now charge that the new bill, which is being proposed by 40 deputies from Sarkozys party, is nothing but a cheap attempt by the unpopular government to play up to Frances 500,000 ethnic Armenians and garner votes before upcoming presidential elections.
Turkish business leaders, who joined a parliamentary delegation in Paris this week to lobby against the initiative, hinted that while Turkey might not go so far as to impose unilateral trade sanctions on France as a consequence of the escalating tiff, they would not hesitate to hamper French business in the country, including possibly derailing profitable defense deals and contracts to build energy pipelines and Turkey's first nuclear power station.

If it passes, the world of business between France and Turkey will be badly hit, Rifat Hisarciklioglu, chairman of the Turkish chambers of commerce, told a press conference in Paris, pointedly referring to orders made by Turkish Airlines for Airbus aircraft and a billion of dollars of investment planned in the energy sector for which French companies would likely be bidders.
France is Turkey's fifth biggest export market and the sixth biggest source of its imports.
This is not the first time France has delved into the sensitive genocide waters. They passed a law recognizing the killing of Armenians as genocide all the way back in 2001, and five years ago, their lower house of parliament passed a bill criminalizing the denial of an Armenian genocide – but the bill was then rejected by the Senate.
The new bill on the table Thursday is actually far more general, and calls to outlaw the denial of any genocide, a change made reportedly in the hope of appeasing the Turks.
History was made today by the Ladies of Chelsea FC.
The first ever Women's FA Cup Final was played at Wembley in front of a domestic record crowd of 30,710.
Remember these players names:
Hedvig Lindahl
Hannah Blundell, Niamh Fahey, Gilly Flaherty, Claire Rafferty
Katie Chapman, Millie Bright, Drew Spence
Gemma Davison, Ji So Yun, Eniola Aluko
These were the players that Emma Hayes chose to start, and win the Women's FA Cup Final against Notts County Ladies FC.
It was the same starting eleven that had lost in the dying minutes against Manchester City Women with a demoralising own goal in the FAWSL1 match just 6 days previously.
Just like Mark Sampson did with the England Lionesses in the Women's World Cup last month, Emma Hayes picked the players up, believed in them and the players did the business!
A 1-0 scoreline doesn't do the Ladies justice, while it may not have been a one sided affair it was as comfortable a 1-0 win in a final that I have ever witnessed. The fact that Hedvig Lindahl didn't have a save to make proves that!
A full match report can be read on the official Chelsea website.
For some reason, there's a story making the rounds again about a pastor who tried to walk on water… and drowned:
… An evangelist who tried replicating Jesus' miracle of walking on water has reportedly drowned off the western coast of Africa. Pastor Franck Kabele, 35, told his congregation he could repeat the biblical miracle, and he attempted it from a beach in Gabon's capital of Libreville. ‘He told churchgoers he'd had a revelation that if he had enough faith, he could walk on water like Jesus,' an eyewitness told the Glasgow Daily Record. ‘He took his congregation to the beach saying he would walk across the Komo estuary, which takes 20 minutes by boat.
Let's put on our Snopes hat for a bit…
This story initially went viral in 2006 after WND, the Christian tabloid that cares little about the truth, posted about it. It's been repeated in several sources ever since. Needless to say, WND is not a credible source for anything.
Furthermore, I dare you to find evidence of what church Kabele led. Or pictures or video of the water-walking attempt (it was 2006; it's not like that technology wasn't available). Or, frankly, anything about the pastor outside of stories about how he supposedly died.
A search for the pastor's name on the Daily Record‘s website also comes up empty.
Yes, it's amusing to believe someone would be so foolish as to actually try walking on water… at least water that hasn't turned into ice. But we skeptics of all people shouldn't be so gullible as to believe this without more evidence.

At last Saturday's GOP presidential debate, several Republican candidates expressed openness to having women register with the Selective Service after the Army and Marine Corps chiefs said that the U.S. should make such a move, much to the dismay of the Religious Right.
Yesterday, Family Research Council President Tony Perkins spoke with ex-Rep. Michele Bachmann, both of whom were stunned that Republican leaders would get behind the policy change, which they said would be disastrous for the military.
Perkins kicked things off by warning that “there is a very good likelihood that we could see the draft” in the near future because “the policies of this administration” have weakened the military and “made the world a very dangerous place.” (Back in 2010, Perkins said that “the president's drive to repeal the ban on open homosexuality in the military” could “bring back the draft.”)
Bachmann said she was “shocked” by the candidates' remarks in the debate, saying that “it's crazy.”
“This is a radical idea,” she said. “It's a darling of the left that's been put forward actually for several decades but it is put forward, interestingly, by people who tend to be not fans of the military and it's people who are on this wild tear to bring about the end of male-female. At the core of this argument really, Tony, is that gender doesn't matter. We've seen it in the marriage debate, but we see it now in this combat readiness debate.”

Buckle up. The NFL's signature Week 8 game will be officiated by the crew that has averaged the highest number of penalty flags per game this season.
When the country last saw referee Jerome Boger, he was calling 23 penalties -- accepted, declined or offsetting -- in the Week 6 Monday night slopfest between the New York Jets and Arizona Cardinals. Sunday night, Boger's crew is scheduled to be at AT&T Stadium for an NFC East showdown between the Philadelphia Eagles and Dallas Cowboys.
Boger's crew averages 20.3 penalty flags per game, as the first chart shows, and it has called between 18 and 24 in each of its six previous outings in 2016. The NFL average is 16.5 calls per game, and Boger's total is 72.6 percent higher than referee Walt Coleman, whose crew has averaged 11.7 penalties per game.

Source: ESPN Stats & Information
As I've written before, NFL officiating crews take on personalities as the season progresses. That's true for other sports as well, be it the strike zone of baseball umpires or the sensitivity to contact of basketball referees.
Boger's crew quite clearly errs on the side of calling a penalty. For further context on the way it approaches games, keep in mind that there have been 10 games this season in which the total number of penalties has been less than half of Boger's average (10 or fewer). About 60.7 percent of all games in the NFL have been called with fewer than 18 penalties, the lowest total Boger has produced in a game.
What does that mean for Sunday night? The good news is that the Cowboys are averaging the NFL's fourth-fewest penalties per game this season (6.6). The bad news: The Eagles rank No. 30 at 10.2 per game. In this case, two of the three factors that go into penalty totals -- the officiating crew and one of the teams -- have histories of high activity. Look out.
Now, take a look at the second chart.
NFL Penalty Frequency By Type Crew Off. holding Passing* Behavior+ Allen, Brad 30 21 15 Anderson, Walt 14 30 11 Blakeman, Clete 24 20 13 Boger, Jerome 24 37 7 Cheffers, Cartlon 24 22 9 Coleman, Walt 12 15 5 Corrente, Tony 33 15 5 Hochuli, Ed 31 20 19 Hussey, John 28 17 16 McAulay, Terry 13 9 8 Morelli, Peter 24 18 13 Parry, John 25 33 8 Steratore, Gene 21 15 12 Torbert, Ronald 23 21 7 Triplette, Jeff 30 23 19 Vinovich, Bill 17 18 7 Wrolstad, Craig 26 7 12 *Offensive PI, defensive PI, illegal contact and defensive holding
+Personal fouls, unnecessary roughness, unsportsmanlike conduct, roughing the passer
The numbers give you a sense of how active each crew is within some of the major penalty categories. You'll see that I've combined the four most common penalties on passing plays -- defensive holding, illegal contact and offensive/defensive pass interference. I also created a category called "behavior," which combined taunting, unsportsmanlike conduct, roughing the passer and unnecessary roughness.
Here are some of the takeaways I see as we look ahead to Sunday and Monday games. One important fact to remember: Referee Terry McAulay has worked only three games this season because of a personal health issue he had last month, so his numbers appear low in the second chart. Also: Foul calls are the shared responsibility of officials and players. On many occasions, officials are at the mercy of how cleanly the players perform.

Scott Applewhite, AP) Story Highlights Khizr Khan told Donald Trump: "You have sacrificed nothing and no one."
Trump responded by criticizing the Gold Star Khan family.
Khizr Khan's son lost his life in Iraq. He was awarded a Bronze Star and Purple Heart.
Decades from now, historians will take a deep dive into the cesspool that was the 2016 presidential campaign.
As the future professors wallow through the mudslinging and misinformation of the Clinton-Trump conflict, they may look back at one defining moment when the election was ultimately decided.
It was one brief flash of clarity when Donald Trump was finally laid low by a previously unknown grieving father.
By now, nearly everyone has seen the emotionally charged video from the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia when Khizr Khan criticized Trump's proposal to temporarily freeze the entry of foreign Muslims into the United States.
Khan, who is a Muslim, lost his son, Capt. Humayun Khan, in Iraq. Humayun Khan was awarded the Bronze Star and a Purple Heart for sacrificing himself to save his unit from a car bomb attack.
During his convention speech, Khizr Khan blasted Trump for his anti-Muslim policies before finally asking of the Republican candidate: “Have you ever even read the United States Constitution? I will gladly lend you my copy.” He then dramatically reached into his pocket for a small version of the historic document.
Not surprisingly, the Democratic crowd roared in approval.
He then told Trump: “You have sacrificed nothing and no one.”
It was a profoundly powerful statement.
Trump then responded by taking the low road, as usual. In the process, he took a bad situation and made it much, much worse.
He repeatedly bashed the Gold Star Khan family.
The backlash from veterans groups and even his Republican supporters was immediate and intense.
They wanted Trump to cease, desist and apologize.
Trump, however, doesn't do apologies. That's just not Donald's way, and he refused to retreat from his criticisms of the Khans.
In the past, none of Trump's outrageous mudslinging seemed to stick to “Teflon” Don. In fact, his supporters only cheered louder at every ugly insult and flat-out lie.

This time, however, was different. This time Trump ripped into the family of a war hero. This time Trump finally stepped well beyond the line.
His comments cost him almost immediately.
In the most recent polls, a race that had been nearly a dead heat suddenly found Hillary Clinton with a lead at or near double digits.
In the divided America in which we now live, 40 percent of the folks will always vote Republican and 40 percent will always vote Democratic. The battle is always for the 20 percent in the mushy middle.Trump's ill-advised reaction to the Khan family may have caused irreparable harm to his standing with that crucial constituency.
Of course, it's a painfully long election cycle. The vote is still three months away. A lot things can, and will, happen. Making a prediction at this juncture is perilous, at best.
Still, this has the feel of a true pivot point.
McCarthy comparison: This may indeed be a McCarthy Moment for Trump.
Joe McCarthy, for those who don't know their history, was a U.S. senator from Wisconsin from 1947 until 1957. He was made famous for his anti-communist bombast during the "Red Scare" in the 1950s. Like Trump, McCarthy had only an occasional relationship with the truth.
McCarthy made a career out of accusing innocent folks of being communists or communist sympathizers, all in an effort to raise his own political profile.
McCarthy didn't care who he hurt, as long as it increased his popularity.
The final straw for McCarthy came during a Senate hearing on June 9, 1954, when Boston lawyer Joseph Welch memorably asked him: “Have you no sense of decency, sir, at long last? Have you left no sense of decency?”
It was a seminal moment.
Finally, on Dec. 2, 1954, the Senate voted overwhelmingly (67-22) to censure McCarthy for his contemptible actions, making him one of the few senators to be disciplined in such a way.
McCarthy's political career was effectively over.
Trump may now face a similar fate.
In three months, the Republican candidate may face a landslide defeat to a significantly flawed candidate.
When the history of that potential defeat is written decades from now, the critical instant may have come on a hot summer night in the birthplace of our American republic, when an obscure but sorrow-stricken father unmasked the impostor who would be president.

How I Came To This Proposal
The notion that housing should be a private commodity owned by a single family has always seemed alienating and unjust to me. This sense of injustice derives from a lifelong interest I have had in cooperative housing and communes. Growing up, I was fascinated by the nearby project at Ecovillage and in college I lived in a student cooperative. Now, I live in an apartment shared with 5 other people, and while we pay rent, we do put a lot of things in common.
A few months ago, I had to let my landlord into my apartment so that he could inspect it with the bank. It turns out that I am helping pay my landlord's mortgage through my rent. This moment highlighted for me how my rent is being transformed into equity for my landlord in this house.
This thought has led me to daydream about what it would mean to pay my own mortgage rather than paying rent. However, I encountered two issues with this idea. First, on a very practical level, I don't have access to enough credit to get a mortgage. Secondly, on a more philosophical level, I don't want to simply move from being a renter to being a property owner––I want to decommodify housing.
Thinking through these two problems has leaded me to the notion of starting a housing cooperative. While there is extensive literature out there on housing cooperatives, I have been trying to theorize my own form for a housing cooperative, one that would move towards decommodifying housing and serve primarily those who are currently paying rent.
The Proposal
My proposal is essentially a proposal for how to start, fund and manage a housing coop that functions to decommodify housing and establish a system of rent-control. It is meant to be both incredibly practical and implementable but also connect to larger struggles against gentrification and property speculation. To explain how I envision this cooperative to work, I have broken it down into five steps: Creation, Acquisition, Rent, Rent-Control and the Communization Fund
1. Creation
The first step in creating a housing cooperative is to assemble a group of like-minded people who want to live together. These people then can review the existing models and create a non-profit that would serve as the housing cooperative. They also would create cryptographically enforced by-laws for this non-profit. Once the structure and common goals of the housing cooperative have been agreed on, they move on to part 2, purchasing a house.
2. Acquisition
In my ideal model, the house would be purchased through a crowdfunding campaign where all backers get a share (equity) in the house. The point of this crowdfunding campaign would not be to get some sort of special reward, but would function akin to a no-interest loan, replacing a centralized bank with a decentralized network. Ideally, this crowdfunding would work through something like Weifund, which is explicitly designed to function in this manner. Other possible sources of funding include tax-deductiable donation grants and mortgages that are specifically for housing cooperatives.
3. Rent
Once the house has been purchased, the members of the new house will move in. Every month they will pay “rent”. This rent would go to purchasing the shares that are owned by people who do not live in the house, essentially repaying them for their no-interest loan. Here is where the innovative aspect of this model lies. Rather than the shares being purchased in their entirety by person paying “rent”, the renter would only receive half of the share, the other half of the share being abolished (which would mean being transferred to ownership by the house itself).
In other words, after the initial round of investment, whenever a share is transferred, half of the share is removed from circulation and becomes owned by the house itself. For the “renter” living in the housing coop, this means that half of their rent purchases equity that they can receive back at some future date while the other half is gone forever. There are several distinct benefits of this model:
Directly serves the needs of renters: money no longer goes to establishing equity or profit for landlord but to a) purchase shares which will be paid back if/when you leave and b) an entity that decommodifies housing. Allows for renter turn-over: there is no necessary long-term commitment from the renters here. One could live in this sort of house for several months and then move to another city (for school, work etc.). Eventually, half of the rent you paid will be returned to you. Incorporate shares (which incentivize people to be part of the housing cooperative) while simultaneously incrementally removing housing as a commodity that is owned by anyone.
4. Rent-Control
After some amount of time, there will no longer be any shares owned by people outside of the house. All the shares at this point will be owned either by a) residents of the housing cooperative or b) the house itself. Now, the need to actually pay “rent" is gone as ownership is fully owned by the housing cooperative or its members. At this point, the nature of rent would fundamentally be transformed. Firstly it would be dramatically reduced, to a level far below market rate. AKA Rent Control! This small rent would go to covering a) property tax and b) a small monthly contribution to the “Communization fund”. People would also have the choice to “abolish” their remaining shares as part of this payment, forgoing future repayment rather than contributing to the “communization fund”.
5. Communization Fund
At some point, the house would be completely de-commodified and small monthly “Rent” payments would be contributed a “communization fund”. This fund would not for the use of the house but rather would to buy shares in housing projects that use the same model. As more houses are formed under this model, this “communization” fund would grow larger and larger - making it increasingly easy to form housing cooperatives. Additionally, if this fund was held as crypto-currency, it could operate globally, helping redistribute wealth and create a global housing commons.
Anyways, this is the proposal and there are still obviously a lot of questions to be answered: How would the crowdfunding work? How would the non-profit be structured? How could smart-contracts be used as the basis of this mode? What sorts of grants would a project like this be eligible for? How would the amount of the "rent-controlled" contribution to the communization fund be determined? Would there be any venture communists willing to seed a “communization fund” to get this housing cooperative project started? Would it be more effective to focus on a city-wide level rather than make the communization fund global? How would you deal with the local legal frameworks of each housing cooperative while also having the communization fund operate globally?
Some major inspiration for this idea came from Dmytri Kleiner's Telekommunist Manifesto, the P2P foundation, the Commons Strategy Group, the notion of Commons Transition and of Open Cooperativism. Also, big shout out to some of the projects taking advantage of the blockchain as well as the rich tradition of housing coops. Also I really doubt I would have brought together all these diverse ideas had it not been for the platform cooperativism conference. Please share your thoughts, criticisms, suggestion and so forth with me! I am curious to hear them!

Anaheim school apologizes for making girl remove NRA T-shirt
On Thursday, the school changed course and apologized to the 16-year-old and said campus staff will be trained so that “an incident like this does not occur again."
"I felt like they were violating my rights, my freedom of speech," the sophomore said. "I want to be able to wear what I want to wear within reason."
Haley Bullwinkle heeded the demand, took off the white T-shirt and slipped on a school shirt that officials at Canyon High in Anaheim handed her, but came home confused and frightened, said her father, who got the shirt when he joined the NRA.
A high school student who grabbed a National Rifle Assn. T-shirt in her hurry to find something to wear to school was later confronted outside class by campus officials who forced the student to remove her shirt or face possible disciplinary action, the girl's parents said.
The offending T-shirt was white with an American flag and a silhouette of a hunter with a rifle and the slogan: “National Rifle Association of America, Protecting America's Traditions Since 1871.”
In asking the student to remove the shirt, school officials said the depiction of the rifle was a violation of the school's dress code. When the student's parents wrote to the school's principal, suggesting that administrators had infringed on their daughter's constitutional rights, Principal Kimberly Fricker responded by sending the parents the school's policy on clothing that depicts violence.
The school's dress code prohibits clothing that promotes or depicts violence, criminal activity and anything that's degrading to ethnic values, among other restrictions.
“In general, anything that is divisive or offensive to a staff member,” the policy said. “The administration reserves the right to restrict any clothing or accessories that in our judgment detracts from the educational environment of Canyon High School.”
However, after reviewing the pictures on the shirt, Fricker later concluded that the shirt didn't promote violence, the Orange Unified School District said in a statement.
“The student will be permitted to wear the shirt,” said Supt. Michael Christensen in a statement.
“If they're going to try to characterize this shirt as depicting violence, then this policy is overboard,” said Chuck Michel, an attorney who has represented the NRA and was working with the Bullwinkle family at the organization's request.
“School officials can't write themselves a policy that gives them unfettered discretion.”
This wasn't the first time Bullwinkle wore the shirt, Michel said, he's not sure why it caught the school's attention this time, but believes it may be connected to the national debate on gun rights.
In 2012 Canyon High School made headlines for its "Seniores" and "Señoritas" events in which students dressed as gang members and a pregnant woman pushing a baby stroller.
The school, which approved the event, has since canceled it after determining the activities were demeaning toward Latinos and their culture.

In a surprise reversal of its previous decisions, the Board of Supervisors voted unanimously on Tuesday to delay a major, 157-unit Mission District housing project on South Van Ness Avenue near 26th Street.
Supervisor David Campos said he changed his mind at the last-minute and moved to support the appeal and delay the project after hearing “hateful and divisive” comments during the public hearing.
“I came into this hearing thinking that I would vote against the appeal,” he said. “But for those of you who always wondered does public comment make a difference, I think this area is a perfect illustration that it does.”
The decision concerned a housing development at 1515 South Van Ness Ave., which activists were appealing on environmental grounds — an argument that they have lost in delaying other projects.
They argued Tuesday – as they have unsuccessfully in the past – that the project's impact on gentrification should be studied before it went forward.
Campos said those arguments won on Tuesday in part because of what he described as hateful comments made by Sonja Trauss, founder of the San Francisco Bay Area Renters Federation.
Trauss, speaking in support of the project, compared activist opposition to new market-rate housing in the Mission to the racist rhetoric of Donald Trump. By preventing new housing, activists were being as unwelcoming of newcomers as Trump, Trauss said.
“When you come here to the Board of Supervisors and say that you don't want new, different people in your neighborhood, you're exactly the same as Americans all over the country that don't want immigrants,” she said. “It's the same attitude, it's the exact same attitude.”
Supervisor Aaron Peskin shook his head as Trauss spoke and sprang out of his seat, walking over to Supervisor David Campos across the chamber room. After another speaker lambasted activists for doing nothing about Mission gangs in the 1990s and called them hypocritical for only caring about the neighborhood now, it became clear that Campos was furious.
He conferred with Supervisor Peskin and walked over to Supervisor John Avalos before returning to his seat. He then moved to delay the project until further study could be done by the city.
“If there's ever a time to stand by doing what is right, that is today,” he said.
The board voted 9-0 to uphold the appeal — Scott Wiener and Norman Yee were absent. The vote means the 157-unit project put forward by Lennar Multifamily Communities will be delayed until the city conducts further study.
At issue in the appeal was what activists called an outdated Eastern Neighborhoods Plan, which governs development in the Mission District, Potrero Hill, Dogpatch, and Central SoMa. The plan, adopted in 2008, exempts projects that meet its guidelines from specific environmental review, a major sticking point for activists who say they are being waved through without regards to their full impact.
The board's decision comes after supervisors in the last five months have twice voted overwhelmingly against appeals launched on similar grounds.
In July, a 395-unit development at 901 16th St. in Potrero Hill was cleared by the board 9-1.
In September, the same appellants who testified on Tuesday gave similar arguments about gentrification and displacement in appealing a 330-unit project at 2000 Bryant St. in the Mission — but the project was unanimously approved after city staff said concerns about affordability should not be addressed under the state's environmental law, known as the California Environmental Quality Act.
Though city staff made the same argument on Tuesday, supervisors went against their analysis and recommended that the city study the “cumulative impacts” of market-rate projects coming to the eastern half of the city.
“We are not paying attention to the entire environment, to the entire landscape,” said Supervisor Malia Cohen. “We are becoming out of balance, and it's important for us to be in sync.”
Reporting like this takes people, feet on the ground. Keep us there. Join Mission local today. Make the Mission a place that values reported content.
Supervisor Campos, for his part, said the appellants “have to do a better job” connecting the issue of displacement with the specific legal issue based on the state's environmental law.
“I'm not happy [with] what was presented by the appellants,” he said. “I don't think they did a good enough job in many respects.”
Nevertheless, he later voted in favor of the appeal.
The Lennar development had reached an affordability milestone in August by making 25 percent of its units available to low and middle income tenants. It was the first project in San Francisco to accomplish the feat without public subsidy or upzoning.
The discussion on Tuesday steered away from affordability questions per se, though activists said they wanted a third or more of the units to be below-market-rate.
It's unclear whether Tuesday's decision holds legal muster, since the appeal was based strictly on the state environmental law. Campos himself said he could be open to lawsuits, but was largely unperturbed.
“Bring it on,” he said.
Trauss said no single public comment from the audience should change the board's mind “since it's a legal question” whether the project should be approved.
Trauss's comment was not the only Trump-related one made during the three-hour public hearing.
Spike Kahn, a landlord who owns several buildings throughout the city and is the founder of the Pacific Felt Factory arts space, said that in the wake of Trump's election city supervisors had a particular obligation to “take a stand to protect our neighbors” by blocking projects in minority neighborhoods like the Mission.
“How can we do better to walk the walk than to protect the Mission and our Latino community members?”
Rick Hall, a neighborhood activist, drew a parallel between San Francisco's sanctuary city status and the recent increased development. He said instead of being a sanctuary city for immigrants and others, the city welcomed only wealthy newcomers.
“We will be a sanctuary city, but only to the undocumented rich,” he said.
It was the comments made by those supporting the project, however, that upset supervisors. Many said those experiencing gentrification should be addressed more respectfully.
Outside the chamber halls, it was a rare moment of happiness for Mission District activists. Typically a quiet crowd after housing decisions at City Hall, they were elated with what they called a “shocking” victory.
“We think it's the right decision,” said Peter Papadopoulos, a lead activist against market-rate development. “The impacts are clear.”
Scott Weaver, a tenants rights attorney who took the lead in opposing the project and argued the appeal, said Campos sided with them because the project is in the Latino Cultural District and that he has an “affinity” for the designation.
The Latino Cultural District is a symbolic designation by the city of the area around 24th Street. It has no housing guidelines, though Campos previously urged that all market-rate development be stopped in the area. Several speakers argued that the culture of the neighborhood would be eroded if more market-rate projects were allowed in.
It's unclear what's next for the Lennar development. It must wait for the city to conduct further study, though it's unclear whether the project would go forward as envisioned or not.
Regardless, the Board of Supervisors is set to see more such appeals. A 117-unit development at 2675 Folsom St. in the Mission will be appealed on the same environmental grounds as the South Van Ness development by the same activists. If today's decision is any indication, it too may be delayed.

Fort Wayne police served a narcotics search warrant in the 2500 block of Weststate Court just before 9 a.m. During the search detectives located over 30 grams of marijuana, over 100 grams of synthetic marijuana (known as spice), drug related paraphernalia, several digital scales and a handgun.
Timothy Harris, 30, and Kayla Langston, 23, were arrested at the scene. Harris faces four felony charges and three misdemeanors, Langston faces two felonies and three misdemeanors.
Both suspects face a felony charge of neglect of a dependent. The Department of Children's Services assisted in the removal of a toddler from the home.
The home was condemned by Fort Wayne Neighborhood Code.
RETAIL Designer jeans seem recession-proof
Expensive denim is jumping off the racks, faster and faster, even as fashion sales fizzle in general. People say the pants are a relative bargain and affordable luxury.
"For women in Los Angeles, who wear jeans almost all of the time, it's an investment," said Morgan, half of the duo responsible for the popular "Go Fug Yourself" blog devoted to outing celebrity fashion victims. "If I wear them every day, they really are not that expensive."
"They make my butt look perky," said Morgan, 33, who owns five pairs of True Religion Brand jeans. "That is the Holy Grail of jeans."
Morgan just bought a pair of $100 Madewell jeans, but her denim nirvana comes from True Religion Apparel Inc. of Vernon. Even at $170 to more than $300, the designer dungarees represent a sacrifice she's willing to make despite the fraying economy.
While consumer spending remains woefully depressed, expensive designer jeans have been one of the few bright spots for manufacturers and retailers, according to NPD Group Inc., a market research company.
Sales of premium brand jeans grew by 17% during 2008 and eked out a 2.3% increase in the most recent three-month period that ended in February, making premium denim one of a few "pockets of growth in an otherwise fizzling fashion market," NPD Group said.
"That is the time period that was the most challenging in terms of consumer spending, so any growth during that time is significant," said Marshal Cohen, NPD Group's chief industry analyst. "With the newfound focus on fit by some of the commodity brands coupled with women's never-ending quest for the perfect pair of jeans, the passion for denim is alive and well."
Denim is one area in which some of the most fundamental rules of the global economy don't appear to apply. Other industries turn to the least expensive foreign labor pools for production. Jeans makers have found that the high cost of manufacturing in the U.S. is actually a selling point.
"In the U.S., people care that their jeans are manufactured here," said Eric Beder, an analyst for Brean Murray, Carret & Co. "To consumers outside the U.S., it's crucial. Jeans are considered an American tradition. To be considered a real premium brand, you need to have the 'made in the USA' label on it."
Adriano Goldschmied, the Italian designer of European jeans brands Diesel, Replay, Goldie and Rivet, agrees. In 2007, Goldschmied's luxury denim label GoldSign merged with Paris-born Jerome Dahan's Citizens of Humanity, based in Huntington Park.
"Nothing more than jeans represent the spirit of America," Goldschmied said. "It's about going to the mall, driving, having fun at the beach. Jeans still represent the life."
Denim buyers aren't going to pull the U.S. economy out of recession, but "it does show that there are people out there who are willing to pay for this sort of thing," Beder said. "It's a relative bargain. The most you are going to pay is $200 to $300. It's affordable luxury. It lasts, and it has a lot of versatility that other clothing items do not have."
Karen Short, an analyst with Friedman, Billings, Ramsey, said that this year has been tough for even the most resilient brands. Short noted that it is difficult to maintain sales at boutique clothing stores when the boutiques are folding.
Recent financial results show that the few publicly held premium jeans manufacturers are holding up fairly well.
True Religion beat analysts' expectations with first-quarter net income that increased 10% to $7.6 million and net sales that rose 19% to $63.6 million, year over year. Joe's Jeans Inc., a Commerce company whose pants retail for $120 and up, saw net income more than double to $800,000 and sales increase 8% to $16.5 million. Guess Inc. posted a 12% boost in adjusted net earnings of $55.3 million, excluding a $22.3-million non-cash impairment charge, and a 9% increase in revenue to $561.1 million in its most recent quarter.
Feeling Fab: Liverpool student becomes the first person to graduate with a degree in The Beatles
A former Miss Canada finalist has become the first person in the world to graduate with a Masters degree in The Beatles.
Canadian singer Mary-Lu Zahalan-Kennedy, 53, was one of the first students to sign up for the course on the Fab Four when it launched at Liverpool Hope University in March 2009.
Twelve full-time students joined the Master of Arts course in 'The Beatles, Popular Music and Society' and Mary-Lu is the first of her class to graduate.
I saw her standing there: Mary-Lu Zahalan-Kennedy, 53, has become the first person to graduate with a Masters degree in The Beatles
A hard day's night: The Beatles MA examines the significance of the music of The Beatles and their impact on Western culture
She said: 'I am so proud of my achievement. The course was challenging, enjoyable and it provided a great insight into the impact The Beatles had and still have to this day across all aspects of life.
Liverpool Hope University officials believe the MA offers the first advanced degree based on the life and times of the Fab Four.
Eight days a week.. But now Mary-Lu has finished her course she is the first person in the world to hold a degree in The Beatles
The ground-breaking course looks at the studio sound and composition of The Beatles and how Liverpool helped to shape their music.
It examines the significance of the music of The Beatles and their impact on Western culture.
Mike Brocken, founder and leader of the Beatles MA, said: 'This programme is the only postgraduate degree in the world of its kind.
'Mary-Lu now joins an internationally recognised group of scholars of Popular Music Studies who are able to offer fresh and thought-provoking insights into the discipline of musicology.'
Ms Zahalan-Kennedy is a professional singer and actress with three CDs recorded and a Juno nomination for Most Promising Female Vocalist in Canada in 1983.
She will return to her husband and two adult daughters in Canada and continue to teach Popular Music Studies in Ontario.
TORONTO -- Raptors point guard Kyle Lowry will opt out of the final year of his contract and test free agency this summer.
The three-time All-Star has one year and $12 million remaining on the four-year, $48 million deal he signed in July 2014.
"I will be opting out and that's as far as I've gotten," Lowry told reporters, according to the Toronto Star. "Honestly, that is as far as I've gotten. We lost yesterday. I still have to get my ankle healthy, get treatment, get to that point."
Lowry is following through on a plan he initially made in October, when he told The Vertical he would prefer to remain with the Raptors but acknowledged he is "open to seeing what else is out there."
Jesse Johnson/USA TODAY Sports
On Monday, he told reporters that his main consideration in choosing where to sign will be his ability to win a championship.
"I want a ring," he said. "That's all that drives me. I want to just get better, I want to have fun, I want to win a ring. I want to make sure my family is happy. That's all I've thought about right now."
Asked if he believed he could get that ring with the Raptors, Lowry said, according to the Star: "I think I can do that anywhere I play. That's just how confident I am."
Lowry averaged career bests of 22.4 points, 7.0 assists and 4.8 rebounds per game this season but was limited to 60 games because of a right wrist injury that required surgery in February.
He is prepared to join a free-agent class that could include Stephen Curry, Kevin Durant, Blake Griffin and Chris Paul. For the Raptors, forwards Serge Ibaka and PJ Tucker, acquired at the trade deadline to beef up Toronto's front line, will be free agents, as will forward Patrick Patterson.
"I like the style of the team, the way they play, the locker room," Ibaka said. "Those guys, they're great, great guys. Since I got here, everything was easier, and I had fun with them."
Sidelined by a sprained left ankle, Lowry was not active Sunday when Toronto was swept in the second round of the playoffs by defending champion Cleveland. Lowry was injured in the third quarter of Game 2 and aggravated the injury while trying to warm up for Friday's Game 3.
The 11-year veteran, now 31, said his age should not be an issue with potential suitors.
"People say, 'Oh, you're over 30,'" Lowry said. "Look at the technology. Dieting, training, everything has changed. The guy we just lost to [James], he's 32 years old, he's still playing at a 25-year-old pace."

Welcome to the FreeTrack website
What is FreeTrack?
FreeTrack is a free optical motion tracking application for Microsoft Windows, released under the GNU General Public License. Its main function is inexpensive head tracking in computer games and simulations but can also be used for general computer accessibility, in particular hands-free computing. Tracking is sensitive enough that only small head movements are required so that the user's eyes never leave the screen.
Head motions are tracked with six degrees of freedom (6DOF), specifically; yaw, pitch, roll, left/right, up/down and forward/back. This is done by means of a video capture device, typically a webcam, which is placed in front of the user and tracks a rigid point model headpiece. This point model usually consists of infrared LEDs but can also be normal LEDs and even retroreflective material illuminated by a source of infrared light.
FreeTrack can output head tracking data directly using TrackIR, SimConnect and FSUIPC interfaces, programs that support these interfaces are regarded as having FreeTrack support. General input devices can also be emulated, specifically mouse, keyboard, and joystick (via PPJoy).

All the news.
A SECOND LANDSCAPE OF LOS ANGELES is exposed when seen from above: the geometric terrain of helipads. This staggered plateau of rooftop space has arisen as if buildings push the land they displace skyward. The CLUI generated an exhibit about this landscape, Elevated Descent: The Helipads of Downtown Los Angeles, which was shown at the Center's Los Angeles space in May, 2009.
No American city comes close to matching the number of helipads that are found in downtown Los Angeles. There are more than 75, and that's just in downtown, not including the rest of the city. This is because of unique local building codes that require new buildings higher than 75 feet to have provisions for emergency landing by helicopter. (80 feet is the general limit of fire truck ladders.) The establishment of this code in 1974 has had a dramatic effect on the look of the city: there are no Postmodern pyramid-topped buldings, no neo-Gothic or Moderne spires, topped by an antenna mast. All major buildings in LA built after 1974 have flat tops, to accommodate the required 50 x 50 foot touchdown pad, surrounded by an obstruction-free Peripheral Area of 25 feet. It's a local idiosyncrasy that no developer or architect has tried hard enough to challenge.
And its not like LA is some futuristic city where helicopters move VIPs around from place to place, high above the common man on the city streets. Most of the rooftop pads in the city are Emergency Helicopter Landing Facilities and are not intended to be used outside of emergency situations. Though there has been no case where lives have been saved by the existence of the helipads—yet.
Some of the rooftop helipads downtown are designed for both emergency and non-emergency use. They have different design and markings from the Emergency Helicopter Landing Facilities. This type is generally identifiable as having a square outline, inside of which is a triangle with the letter H or other lettering or logo, which indicates the preferred direction of approach. In some cases the word “private” or “PVT” is sometimes used, indicating that this helipad is not for everyone. But this is redundant, as all of the helipads in downtown Los Angeles are Prior Permission Required (PPR) helipads, requiring the permission of their owners or operators for their use. So park it elsewhere.
Scanning the helipads of the city, encountering a truly anomalous marking is usually an indication that it is a government pad atop a government building—county, state, or federal. Though the FAA has guidelines for the design of helipads and helistops, they do not enforce the implementation of the designs, and the government seems to do what they want. Heliports—airports for helicopters—are another matter, and have FAA guidelines that are enforced. There is only one such true heliport downtown, the LAPD's main helicopter facility, the Jay Stephen Hooper Memorial Heliport. Located at the edge of downtown, next to Highway 101 and the LA River, the LAPD heliport can accommodate more than one helicopter at a time, and is active day and night. With the second largest civilian air force in the country, the LAPD is the lord of Los Angeles' skies.
The exhibit at CLUI included projections, sound, text, and images of every helipad atop a downtown building, as seen from above, as well as the name and image of every downtown building with a helipad, taken from the ground looking up.
Elevated Descent was a presentation of the Center's Air/Land Program, and was supported by a grant from the Los Angeles Department of Cultural Affairs.
Most modern laptops automatically dim the screen when the light conditions in the room change. If there is a lot of light, the screen normally increases in brightness to make sure you can still see everything clearly. If the light conditions are turned down, the screen will also descrease in brightness. This isn't only pleasant on the eyes, but will also probably extend your battery life. But why not take this a step further and not only adjust the brightness of the screen, but also increase the readability of the web site in the user's browser?
In this article I'll show you how you can use input from the webcam, in a fully HTML5 compatible manner, to detect the luminance of the room. If you're in a brightly lit location, the browser will dynamically increase the contrast between the background and the fonts. If the lighting conditions change, you'll see this also automatically reflected in the background. If you want to directly look at the result look here.
With a bright room we see this: With a dark room we see this:
For those of you that don't have a webcam to test with, I recorded a small movie that shows the effect we're aiming at:
What do you need to do for this:
Allow access to the webcam At an interval get a screenshot from the webcam Calculate the luminance of the room Adjust the CSS for the background
The first couple of steps are easy, and you can find a more detailled explanation in one of my previous posts.
Allow access to the webcam
I tested the code in this article with the latest development build of chromium. To enable webcam access (through the webrtc APIs) you need to open chrome to the following page: And there enable getUserMedia API. Restart the browser to be sure, and you have access to the getUserMedia operation that you can use to access the video stream (and in a later version also an audio stream).
At an interval get a screenshot from the webcam
To calculate the luminance of the room you need to take a snapshot from the video stream so that you can determine how bright it is in the room. This is also something I discussed in the same article, so I won't go into too much detail. You need to do the following:
Output the videostream to a video element. Copy a snapshot from the video element to a canvas element. Get the content of the canvas as a set of bytes for further processing
It isn´t useful to show the video, so create a div with a video element, and use css to hide the div.
<!-- use an hidden video element --> <div style="visibility: hidden; height: 0; width: 0"> <video id="live" width="320" height="240" autoplay></video> </div>
To connect to the webcam and stream the data to the webcam all you need to do is this:
video = document.getElementById("live") navigator.webkitGetUserMedia("video", function (stream) { console.log(stream); video.src = webkitURL.createObjectURL(stream); }, function (err) { console.log("Unable to get video stream!") } )
Now you need to capture a screenshot every couple of seconds. For this you just use the setInterval javascript function, and from there you can use the following to capture the current screen from the video:
// create a dummy context var ctx = $('<canvas />', {width:'320', height:'240'})[0].getContext('2d'); ctx.drawImage(video, 0, 0, 320, 240); var imgd = ctx.getImageData(0, 0, 320, 240); var pix = imgd.data;
The pix variable will now contain the bytes that make up the image. With this bytearray you can calculate the luminance of the picture.
Calculate the luminance of the room
Calculating the luminance of the picture isn't that hard. You check the brightness of each pixel and add them. The result is the total luminance of our picture. This function, combined with the capture part now looks like this:
function calculateLuminance(w, h) { // draw the current image ctx.drawImage(video, 0, 0, w, h); var imgd = ctx.getImageData(0, 0, w, h); var pix = imgd.data; var totalL = 0; for (var i = 0, n = pix.length; i < n; i += 4) { // Red, Green and Blue have different influence on the total luminance totalL += pix[i ] * .3 + pix[i + 1] * .59 + pix[i + 2] * .11; } return totalL; }
That leaves us just with the last part. Change the background based on the current luminance.
Adjust the CSS for the background
To increase or decrease the luminance I use the following function (courtesy of stackoverflow):
// http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5560248/programmatically-lighten-or-darken-a-hex-color function LightenDarkenColor(col, amt) { var usePound = false; if (col[0] == "#") { col = col.slice(1); usePound = true; } var num = parseInt(col, 16); var r = (num >> 16) + amt; if (r > 255) r = 255; else if (r < 0) r = 0; var b = ((num >> 8) & 0x00FF) + amt; if (b > 255) b = 255; else if (b < 0) b = 0; var g = (num & 0x0000FF) + amt; if (g > 255) g = 255; else if (g < 0) g = 0; return (usePound ? "#" : "") + (g | (b << 8) | (r << 16)).toString(16); }
This function should be called from the setInterval javascript function which is executed every couple of seconds:
// luminance for dark is around 300.000 var lower = 300000; // luminance for bright is around 6.000.000, could be different per webcam var higher = 6400000; // base color that we change var baseColor = "666666"; timer = setInterval( function () { var luminance = calculateLuminance(320, 240); // based on the luminance we need to set the background // color to a specific value. We do this by calculating // the required target offset var offsetFromCenter = ((luminance - lower) / (higher - lower)) * 100; // now we can increase the luminance of the background var targetColor = LightenDarkenColor(baseColor, offsetFromCenter); console.log(luminance); $("body").animate({ backgroundColor:"#" + targetColor }, 2000); }, 2000);
And that's it. Now every two seconds a screenshot is taken, the luminance of that screenshot is calculated, and using jquery animations the background color is adjusted.

The business applications for gamification are no longer just a matter for academic discussion. It's literally time for CIOs to get into the game.
Gamification is about taking the essence of games—fun, play, and passion—and applying it to real world, non-game situations. In a business setting, that means designing solutions using gaming principles in everything from back office tasks and training, to sales management and career counseling.
Over the past year or so, gamification has become a central part of almost every enterprise business package. This has made it imperative for CIOs to understand the avenues for generating value from gamification techniques throughout the organization. It's not just about making work fun or even increasing engagement with employees and customers. The real value comes from using gamification to understand, measure, and analyze behaviors and then creating incentives to adjust behaviors to achieve desired business outcomes.
Early efforts have focused on using gamification with sales teams to understand not only how to improve the sales pitch, but also how to redesign products to increase sales. And these techniques show great promise for helping organizations sustain culture changes and organizational transformations.
Doug Palmer, a principal with Deloitte Consulting LLP, explains why gamification should be a priority on the CIO's agenda.
An unfortunate side effect of the iOS App Store's prominence is the idea that games should only be ninety-nine cents. Thankfully for those unable to escape that mindset, independent game bundles have come to the rescue in the last year. Typically featuring multiple games, soundtracks, and other extras, these bundles can be had for a fraction of the games' retail cost.
Establishing a grant for independent developers and featuring the exclusive debut of a new adventure title, the Bundle In A Box is the newest entrant in the pay-what-you-want bundle race.
The Bundle In A Box: Adventure Bundle is set to feature Ben There, Dan That! Special Edition, Time Gentlemen, Please!, 1893: A World's Fair Mystery, The Sea Will Claim Everything, Metal Dead, The Shivah, and Gemini Rue. Starting at $2.99 and dropping a nickel for every 500 purchases, the pay-what-you-want bundle marks the debut of Jonas Kyratzes' The Sea Will Claim Everything (no, it's not a Mogwai b-side), and 1893: A World's Fair Mystery sees a fascinating piece of interactive historical fiction (read: text-adventure) join a bundle for the first time.
Additionally, for every 15,000 sold, $2,000 will be added to the Indie Dev Grant fund, and when the bundle's wrapped the accumulated sum will be given to one lucky independent developer. Additionally, a portion of the proceeds will go to help Perivolaki – The Hellenic Centre for Mental Health and Treatment of Child and Family, a non-profit organization in Greece that provides assistance for mentally ill children and their families.
No belly-aching about bundle fatigue allowed – skip your mocha today and pitch in to help out both the indie community and a very worthwhile charity. For all the information you need or to purchase, check out Bundle In A Box starting today!

Members of the board call the attention of the noontime show over complaints against the segment 'Nasaan Ka Mr. Pastillas'
Published 10:36 PM, October 06, 2015
MANILA, Philippines – The Movie and Television Review and Classification Board (MTRCB) summoned the executives behind It's Showtime after receiving complaints over the "Pastillas Girl" segment, which is part of the noontime show.
In a memo posted on Twitter dated October 1, the board asked the show's director Norbert Vidanes, business unit head Reily Santiago and executive producer Mark Rejano to come on October 13 for a meeting on “gender sensitivity concerns.” The board said they decided to schedule a meeting following complaints from many viewers as well as the group Gabriela.
Here's the letter in full:
“Further to the Memorandum of Understanding dated 28 March 2012 by and between our Agency and various television networks and entities, including ABS-CBN Corporation, as well as the official letter we received last week from the party-list alliance Gabriela, not to mention some feedback from the general public, we are impelled to invite your authorized representatives for the program 'It's Showtime' to a dialogue with the Special Sub-Committee of our Gender And Development (GAD) Committee on 13 October 2015, at 10:00 a.m., at our ground floor conference room.”

Last September, Angelica Jane Yap or known as Pastillas Girl became a viral hit after she posted a video of her reciting ingredients in making pastillas de leche (soft milk candy) in relation to her being dumped by her boyfriend. (READ: Meet 'Pastillas Girl,' on a quest to find love)
After her video became popular, Angelica was asked by the people of It's Showtime to appear on the show. She's on a mission to find a new partner through the show's segment "Nasaan Ka Mr. Pastillas."
On Tuesday, October 6, Angelica turned down another suitor named Jomari Tormento, saying she would like to be friends with him instead. A previous suitor named Jess Senido was also turned down by Angelica.
This is not the first time It's Showtime has been summoned by MTRCB. In August 2014, the show was also summoned by the board for Vice Ganda's antics in the "Gandang Lalaki" portion. – Rappler.com
Lee Harris, 47, allegedly ordered a woman at knife-point into an abandoned building than raped her

A man was arrested after being accused of raping a woman in Pittsburgh's Uptown neighborhood “because she's white.” Public safety spokeswoman Sonya Toler said officers determined 47-year-old Lee Harris was inside an apartment in the 5200 block of Gertrude Street in Hazelwood early Saturday morning. SWAT was called to the scene. Harris was taken into custody at 2:30 a.m. after being found in the basement. Toler said Harris refused commands by officers and a K9 was utilized. According to the criminal complaint, Harris ordered a woman at knife-point into an abandoned building in September. The victim, who is not being identified since she is a victim of sexual assault, told police she knew Harris from seeing him in the neighborhood before but she never knew his name and didn't have a relationship with him. When she walked home, Harris passed her then decided to walk with her. In the criminal complaint, police state the victim and Harris approached the intersection of Watson and Jumonville streets, and Harris “pulled out a knife from his pocket, put it to her neck and ordered Jane Doe to walk to an abandoned building.” She complied, fearing he would kill her. Once inside, “she was forced to go to the second floor where Harris pushed her into a small room.” It's there he allegedly assaulted, raped and threatened the woman. When she asked why he was doing it, he told her “because you're white.” Harris was arrested on a series of charges including rape, sexual assault and ethnic intimidation. He was taken to UPMC Mercy Hospital where a bite to his lower leg was treated and then taken to the Allegheny County Jail.
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump signed a revised executive order on Monday banning citizens from six Muslim-majority nations from traveling to the United States but removing Iraq from the list, after his controversial first attempt was blocked in the courts.
The new order, which takes effect on March 16, keeps a 90-day ban on travel to the United States by citizens of Iran, Libya, Syria, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen. It applies only to new visa applicants, meaning some 60,000 people whose visas were revoked under the previous order will now be permitted to enter.
Immigration advocates said the new ban still discriminated against Muslims and failed to address some of their concerns with the previous order. Legal experts said it would, however, be harder to challenge because it affects fewer people living in the United States and allows more exemptions to protect them.
Trump, who first proposed a temporary travel ban on Muslims during his presidential campaign last year, had said his original Jan. 27 executive order was a national security measure meant to head off attacks by Islamist militants.
It sparked chaos and protests at airports, where visa holders were detained and later deported back to their home countries. It also drew criticism from targeted countries, Western allies and some of America's leading corporations before a U.S. judge suspended it on Feb. 3.
“As threats to our security continue to evolve and change, common sense dictates that we continually re-evaluate and reassess the systems we rely upon to protect our country,” Secretary of State Rex Tillerson told reporters after Trump signed the new order.
PELOSI SAYS BAN STILL ‘IMMORAL'
Democrats, a minority in Congress, quickly signaled fierce opposition to what they called a discriminatory ban.
“The Trump administration's repackaging has done nothing to change the immoral, unconstitutional and dangerous goals of their Muslim and refugee ban,” House of Representatives Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi said in a statement.
Farhana Khera, executive director of Muslim Advocates, a civil rights group in Washington, said the Trump administration had “doubled down on anti-Muslim bigotry.”
She told reporters on a conference call: “It's crystal clear this is a Muslim ban.”
But some Republicans who had been critical of Trump's original order were more positive on the new one.
Bob Corker, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said he was “very encouraged” by the approach and pleased that Iraq was removed from the list.
Iraq was taken off the banned list because the Iraqi government has imposed new vetting procedures, such as heightened visa screening and data sharing, and because of its work with the United States in countering Islamic State militants, a senior White House official said.
Trump's original ban resulted in more than two dozen lawsuits in U.S. courts. The Justice Department estimated 60,000 people had their visas revoked by the first order but senior administration officials said on Monday those visas were now valid again for entry into the United States.
“By rescinding his earlier executive order, President Trump makes one thing perfectly clear: his original travel ban was indefensible - legally, constitutionally and morally,” said Attorney General Bob Ferguson of Washington state, which succeeded in having the previous ban suspended.

His office will likely decide this week on whether to proceed with litigation over the new order, he said.
Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said he expected the revised order to have the same uphill battle in the courts as the original version.
“A watered down ban is still a ban,” he said in a statement. “Despite the administration's changes, this dangerous executive order makes us less safe, not more, it is mean-spirited, and un-American. It must be repealed.”
HARDER TO CHALLENGE
The fact the ban affects fewer people already in the United States means it will be more difficult for opponents to find plaintiffs who have been harmed by the order and thus have legal standing to challenge it, legal experts said.
The revised order expressly makes waivers possible for a foreign national seeking to enter the United States to visit a spouse, child or parent who is a U.S. citizen, or for “significant business or professional obligations.”
“They dotted their i's and crossed their t's in trying to anticipate what litigation might result,” said Stephen Yale-Loehr, a Cornell Law School professor.
The revised order means that tens of thousands of legal permanent U.S. residents - or green card holders - from the listed countries will no longer be affected.
The original order barred travelers from the seven nations from entering for 90 days and all refugees for 120 days. Refugees from Syria were to be banned indefinitely but under the new order they are not given separate treatment.

Refugees “in transit” and already approved would be able to travel to the United States under the new order.
Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, who along with several other senior Cabinet members had lobbied for Iraq's removal from the list of banned countries, was consulted on the new order and the updated version “does reflect his inputs,” Pentagon spokesman Captain Jeff Davis said.
Thousands of Iraqis have fought alongside U.S. troops for years or worked as translators since the U.S.-led invasion in 2003. Many have resettled in the United States after being threatened for working with U.S. troops.
As the new world order ushers in, take your mind off terrestrial problems with my blog update and game announcement!
It has been a dang long while since my last post, for a quick catch up I returned to civil engineering for 8 months, workin' for the man to fund games development. So as of July, apart from a bit of travel, I've been back into the fray , keeping Maggi noodles shares high and striving to reach the dream of a games developer (professional).
It began while researching ideas to make a mobile game in a short amount of time, (initially around a month or two max – yeah right..). While meandering around the internet, I came upon Tempest by Dave Theurer from Atari. Apparently the original designer was inspired by a dream about creatures crawling out of the ground.
The early prototypes of Tempest were meant to be a 3d version of space invaders, but due to technical constraints the design was changed into what became Tempest, a sort of 2.5d space invaders.
The unique look and frantic action inspired me to create a game using the idea of enemies coming toward the player in 3d space while traveling on circumference of the tunnel.
Here you can see the player movement, a power up weapon and suitcase enemies.
I've created a variety of different level shapes with increasing enemy waves, weapon power ups, unlockable deadly/cute animal characters, (who wouldn't want to play as an augmented rabbit given half the opportunity?). It is being developed for Android, but of course if you will be on Apple if it gains interest.
As usual I am developing in Unity and C#, (my white board went through a few iterations of spider webs post-it notes) The 3d assets were modified purchases from the asset store. Also fortunately I also have my talented sister on board who created the players ship, the brief I gave her was: something similar to Roger Ramjets jet, and oula! As you can see in the animation it looks pretty spiffing!
I am also in the process of implementing a purchasing system so that players are able to unlock characters. Actually building an economy into a game is more than a tad daunting. Having spent a huge chunk of time and effort learning programming, Unity engine and games design. And then actually making something that is not only hard to put down, building a meta game that keeps players returning and make a purchase is a whole other beast! Talking to other people who sell there arts or crafts, they had similar feelings, not believing in the worth of their creations usually until getting into the marketplace and putting themselves out there, they found there work is actually worth more than they give themselves credit for.
So the core gameplay is a stage now where as Winston would say: “Further testing is required” (..I play too much Overwatch)
In other more understandable words, I need awesome people to test the core gameplay, feedback how to make it pop, shimmer and glitter more. Help me get it to the stage where it is thus proclaimed: “FUN!”.
I'm asking you my developer friends, friends of friends and future friends!
So if you are up for a bit of arcade space pew pew pew, and want to keep in the loop on beta testing connect with me on Twitter, follow this blog or send me a good ol' fashioned email!
Follow this blog for updates and get more information, -you wonderful fancy person you!

Microsoft has quietly released a new productivity application to both Google Play and the iTunes App Store called Project Sonoma. The app is aimed at those who work outside of a traditional office environment, like shift workers, waiters, and others who need to keep track of ever-changing schedules and who need to chat with co-workers at times.
The company hasn't made any official announcement about the launch of Project Sonoma, nor is the app publicly available at this time. Instead, Microsoft says the app is in “Private Preview,” and there's a waitlist businesses can join if they want to test.
Project Sonoma – if that is what the app will eventually be called (after all, it sounds more like a codename) – is a bit like a lightweight version of Slack, given its team chat emphasis. But it's clearly aimed more at managing employees' schedules, than collaboration.
In the app's main screen, there are three sections: My Shifts, Requests, and Messages. The first allows the employee to track their schedules and see when they're working next. Request lets them ask for schedule changes or swap shifts with others. Meanwhile, the Messages section is a simple team chat where you could receive important updates from the management, ask questions of co-workers, and chat with your work colleagues.
[gallery ids="1372763,1372764,1372765"]
There was some speculation that Project Sonoma is the result of a small acquisition or acqui-hire on Microsoft's part. On Google Play, the app's package name as seen in its URL includes the word “shiftr.” This happens to also be the name of a Sydney-based app called Shiftr, founded by Ludek Dolejsky and Adrian Dean, which focused on employee scheduling, too.
Its website is no longer live, only leading to a blank page. Shiftr had some small seed investment, including from SenseDoc founder Steen Andersson, who previously sold his mobile marketing company 5th Finger AU to Microsoft. That made it seem likely that Microsoft could have bought Shiftr, but the company denies it.
According to a spokesperson:
Project Sonoma is an app we are testing with a limited group of customers that lets employees view and manage their work shifts from their phone. People whose company has signed up to participate during the testing phase can install and use the app. We are not disclosing the names or number of companies participating in the test. We're always building and incubating new solutions to help people get more done, and we don't have any availability timelines or details to share at this time. We can confirm that Project Sonoma has been developed internally by Microsoft from the ground up and is not based on an acquisition.
The app's existence was first spotted by the blog Mspoweruser.com, which saw it was live on Google Play in preview mode. The app was updated on Google Play just a few days ago, but the iOS version has been live since June 10th.
Meanwhile, there's a very basic Project Sonoma website that offers little information about the app in question, beyond offering a way for testers to sign up or join the waitlist.
Earlier today, Microsoft announced a related move to beef up its software's ability to manage scheduling, this time to improve the scheduling capabilities in Office, through the acquisition of the chatbot Genee. Managing schedules is something that's important for productivity, but there are a number of ways this can be handled outside of the calendaring interface.

The competition to give cord-cutters a less expensive replacement for cable that satisfies live television needs increased on Wednesday as Hulu entered the crowded field.
Hulu, the streaming video company, announced that Hulu Live would join products like DirecTV Now, Sling TV, PlayStation Vue and YouTube TV in trying to appeal to people who want live television but do not want to pay more than $100 a month for large cable bundles. The services offer smaller bundles of channels and allow viewers to watch live television outside the home on mobile devices. Because the video is delivered over the internet, consumers do not need to buy bulky hardware.
But choosing a service can be overwhelming. Each lacks channels or features that some viewers consider essential.

Here are questions to ask when considering the services:
How many screens do I need?
If you live alone, this may not be a concern. But for families with more than one child, or for apartment dwellers with roommates, being able to watch on only two screens at once may not cut it.
IN FAR WESTERN China on the edge of the Gobi desert, 17-year-olds in a social-studies class are discussing revolution (the Russian one) and the use and abuse of nationalism (Germany, Italy). When the teacher asks what “totalitarianism” is, a girl immediately replies: “One leader, one ideology, no human rights.” These are Chinese pupils in a Chinese classroom studying the second world war, but by attending Lanzhou Oriental Canadian School they have already written themselves out of at least part of a Chinese future. They will all go to university abroad, many to Canada, others to the United States, Australia and Britain. So great is Chinese demand for foreign schooling that even here in Gansu, China's second-poorest province, a new block is being built to house more students; the hoardings on the building site are plastered with posters about “The Chinese Dream”, a slogan Xi Jinping launched in 2012 to promote the country's “great revival”. But like hundreds of thousands of people across China, these teenagers and their families harbour a different dream: escape.
Since the country started opening up in 1978, around 10m Chinese have moved abroad

The extraordinary outflow of people from China is one of the most striking trends of recent decades. Since the country started opening up in 1978, around 10m Chinese have moved abroad, according to Wang Huiyao of the Centre for China and Globalisation, a think-tank in Beijing. Only India and Russia have a larger diaspora, both built up over a much longer period. The mass exodus of students like those at Lanzhou Oriental is just one part of the story. Since 2001 well over 1m Chinese have become citizens of other countries, most often America; a far larger number have taken up permanent residence abroad, a status often tied to a specific job that may last for years and can turn into citizenship.
Chinese make up the bulk of individuals who are given investor visas, a fast-track immigration system offered by many countries to the super-wealthy. Others are just moving their money offshore, investing in foreign companies or buying property. Officially Chinese citizens are limited to moving $50,000 abroad a year, but many are finding inventive ways to get round that rule, including overpaying for imports, forging deals with foreign entities and even starting, then losing, fake lawsuits against foreign entities, triggering huge “damages”.
An export industry
Studying abroad has become an ambition for the masses: 57% of Chinese parents would send their child overseas to study if the family had the means, according to the Shanghai Academy of Social Sciences. Even Mr Xi sent his daughter to study at Harvard. Nor is this open only to the super-rich. Liang Yuqi from Zhangye, a city close to Lanzhou, is being quietly guided towards a relatively cheap Canadian state university to study psychology. Her parents are government officials who have never been abroad (cadres must hand in their passport) and will pool money from relatives to fund her foreign education. The sacrifice is worth it, says her mother: in middle school Yuqi was “fat” and “mediocre”, now she is confident and asks lots of questions. Many others are spending their all to make the break. More than half a million university students went overseas last year.
This aspirational market is served by hundreds of international schools in China. Some cater for non-Chinese citizens, often the foreign-born offspring of returning Chinese. Since 2003 a growing number of regular Chinese schools, such as Lanzhou Oriental Middle School, have launched lucrative international programmes for Chinese passport-holders (fees at Lanzhou Oriental's international arm are 70,000 yuan ($11,000) a year, 11 times the price of a regular education there). Their popularity caused a backlash against the use of public facilities and funds to send kids to study abroad after they finished school. Beijing city government and a number of provincial authorities have stopped approving new international programmes, and the education ministry is pondering nationwide restrictions. But students are leaving younger and younger. Since 2005 the number of Chinese secondary-school pupils in America alone has increased almost 60-fold, to 35,000.
Of the 4m Chinese who have left to study abroad since 1978, half have not returned, according to the education ministry. By most unofficial counts the share is even larger. In some fields the brain drain is extreme: almost all of China's best science students go abroad for their PhDs, and 85% of Chinese science and engineering graduates with American PhDs had not returned home five years after leaving, a study by the National Science Foundation found this year. Many of the teenagers at Lanzhou Oriental Canadian School know that they are responsible for their entire family's future: 16-year-old Hai Yingqi says she has to get a good enough job upon graduation to allow her parents, young brother and all four grandparents to emigrate.
One, two, flee
China has long seen education as a passport to success, which helps explain why the middle class is now focusing on foreign schools and universities. One Beijing businesswoman preparing to give birth in America says she wants to avoid sending the child to a Chinese school because she would have to bribe her way into a good primary school, and then “make sure the teacher is happy”—more bribes: “It's not the money I mind, but the trouble.” Another parent questions how a child can learn values in such a system, and cites the corrupting influence of “patriotic education”, the compulsory propaganda classes all pupils must attend, where there is only one right answer and nothing can be questioned.
Others find different exit strategies. The super-rich can, in essence, buy foreign residency. Chinese citizens who invest at least £2m ($3m) in Britain are promised permanent residency in five years; Australia offers a similar scheme for A$5m ($3.6m). Around 70,000 Chinese millionaires have emigrated to Canada since 2008 under an immigrant investor scheme. This is no longer in operation, but the country is now encouraging Chinese entrepreneurs and startups. Hong Kong has cracked down on mainland mothers giving birth there to gain Hong Kong passports (and citizenship has become less appealing than it used to be), but birth tourism to America and other countries is increasing. And many of those working for multinational companies eventually transfer elsewhere.
Businesspeople who have returned to the mainland now lead some of China's most innovative companies. But most come back only once they have secured an escape route for themselves or their children. The government has sponsored some expensive schemes to lure academics back to China, and some have taken up the invitation, having first made sure that their children were born abroad so they would be able to choose where to live in future. Yao Ming, a famous 2.29-metre-tall basketball player, is one of China's icons, a true product of the Communist Party (which encouraged his exceptionally tall parents to marry), but his daughter, now six, was born in America. Chen Kaige, one of China's best-known film directors, has at least two American children; Gong Li, a film star, and Jet Li, a Chinese martial-arts actor, both have Singaporean passports.
Outflows of capital, even more than people, directly mirror political risk. The torrent of cash flowing out of China almost exactly matches fears about the strength of the economy and the government's capacity to handle it (see chart). In the second half of 2015, for example, capital moved abroad at an annual rate of $1 trillion in response to a fragile economy, the government's botched attempt to intervene in the falling stockmarket and a slight but unexpected drop in the yuan. The government temporarily slowed that outflow by stepping up capital controls earlier this year and taking some sensible decisions on the economy. Yet as with so many problems, the party dealt with the immediate crisis, not the underlying cause.
China has long been a land of emigration, establishing small outposts of its people in almost every country in the world. Their main motive was to escape poverty. But those now bowing out are among China's richest and most skilled. It is a profound indictment of their country that being able to leave it is such a strong sign of success.
“Many pimps . . . saw themselves as managers, as business owners, as entrepreneurs.” Meredith Dank lead author of study on illegal sex trade
WASHINGTON—They pit employees against each other to maximize performance, set financial quotas and are adapting to a rapidly changing technological landscape.

That may sound like a description of corporate executives or other business managers. But it also applies to the illegal sex trade, according to a study published by the Urban Institute in Washington. “Many pimps had a business savvy and they knew what they needed to do to maximize profits,” said Meredith Dank, the study's lead author and a former commodities analyst. “They saw themselves as managers, as business owners, as entrepreneurs.” The conclusions are based on interviews with 260 pimps, prostitutes and law enforcement officials in eight U.S. cities. The sex trade in seven of those cities — Washington, Atlanta, Dallas, Seattle, San Diego, Miami and Denver — totalled $975 million in 2007, or $1 billion today in inflation-adjusted dollars, according to the study. Kansas City, Mo., one of the cities examined, wasn't included in the economic analysis.

Funded by a $499,000 Justice Department grant, the study was one of the first to probe the business side of the sex trade. Dank interviewed 73 jailed pimps and three dozen prostitutes for the 340-page report, “Estimating the Size and Structure of the Underground Commercial Sex Economy in Eight Major U.S. Cities.” She said understanding the business side of the illegal sex trade should help authorities better prevent and combat it. The sex business has become more reliant on the Internet and mobile technology to recruit prostitutes and customers. More than half of the pimps surveyed said they used some form of online advertising, the study found. More than 70 per cent of the pimps said they travelled to cities hosting major events, such as the National Basketball Association playoffs, for the large crowds of men. They even visited the sites of natural disasters because those areas were often flooded with workers who had cash to spend, Dank said. Pimps employed an average of five prostitutes and street gangs were increasingly involved, the study found. The pimps treated women as a commodity “like gold, platinum,” one said.
Some pimps established quotas for their workers and others intentionally fuelled competition between their prostitutes. “I had a quota of $600. If they came back with $550 or even $599, she had to just go back out,” one pimp reported. Although the economic downturn pushed down prices, most of those surveyed “shared the sentiment that a high market demand for sex always exists,” the study said. Competing pimps weren't as cutthroat with each other as researchers had expected. “Many pimps viewed it as a brotherhood, a code they abided by, where they would help each other out,” Dank said.
Authorities today identified a man shot to death over the weekend during an argument at a Jefferson County home.
The Jefferson County Coroner's Office identified the victim as Kenneth Brown. Brown was 61.
Brown was one of two people shot at the home in the 400 block of Morgan Road near Bessemer. Authorities have not released the name of the surviving victim.
Chief Deputy Randy Christian said the suspect and the victims were arguing inside the Morgan Road home. The suspect, a 52-year-old man, went to his car to get a handgun. He then returned to the house and shot and killed Brown. Brown was shot at 12:09 a.m., and pronounced dead on the scene at 12:31 a.m.
The younger victim, a 37-year-old man, was shot while wrestling the gun away from the suspect. He was seriously injured in the shooting and taken to a hospital. He is expected to recover after undergoing surgery.
The suspect was still on the scene and was taken into custody. Christian said he is expected to be formally charged on Tuesday.
Since “The Help” came out, I've been reading lots of commentary about race, gender and Hollywood. If I had a dollar for every time I've read the phrase, “But we don't support our own” in response to a critique of mainstream representation of black life, I could start my own studio. The defeatist idea here is that when “we” do manage to create quality, nuanced, authentic or heroic stories, “we” don't buy enough movie tickets or pull enough Nielsen weight to prove that there's a demand for more.
I'm not going to get into how absurd it is to expect individual consumers of color to suddenly transform a staggeringly white, male, risk-averse industry that has been profiting from racist, sexist, homophobic, ableist, cornball narratives since its inception. Instead, I'll give you the wise words of Jeffrey Wright, who recently linked the dearth of strong black storylines to a lack of traditional financing:
“The issue for all black artists is who controls the resources that allow for the work to happen. It's said that he who controls the resources controls the story. […] I don't really see black cinema because there's no African American financing that's equal to the talent among writers, directors and actors. There's no circle that can be drawn to define African American cinema. We're probably one of the few cultures in the world who don't have a firm grip on our own cultural output in that way.”
Watching the growth of my favorite Web series, “The Misadventures of Awkward Black Girl and Friends,” (ABG), I'm optimistic about the future of black storytelling online. The show, which debuted in January, centers on the internal life of J, an insecure, shockingly uncool young black woman with a teeny ‘fro and a regular body. Through her hilariously dry voiceovers–and her comical gangster raps–we get J's alienated take on everything from bad spoken word to racially insensitive co-workers to cross-cultural friendship. On the first Thursday of every month, some 60,000 viewers tune in to the short episodes. And the show's L.A.-raised, Senegalese-American creator and star, Issa Rae, recently signed with United Talent Agency and 3 Arts Entertainment, the same folks who rep Tina Fey.
By July, however, Rae and ABG producer and costar, Tracy Oliver, were running low on personal funds. To keep the show going while they weighed their growing mainstream options, the duo launched a Kickstarter campaign to raise $30,000. Fans donated $56,259 for five more episodes. Clearly, there's a demand for black, female-centered satire that deals with isms in the same breath as office stapler theft.
Being the ABG stan that I am, I checked in with Rae late last week. Below, excerpts of our phoner:
One of the things that stands out about ABG is how the characters are as defined by their hilarious quirks as they are by their cultural identities. You have Baby Voice Darius, J's black coworker who refuses to speak above a whisper but has the nerve to DJ house parties. There's Cee Cee, J's Indian American best friend who is clueless about race but sees herself as an expert on interracial dating. And of course there's J–the passive aggressive, alienated misfit. It's rare to see people of color play these kinds of characters. Did you set out to expand the boundaries when you came up with the show?
I did want to create characters who weren't represented on TV because people are thirsty. [But] the characters are also an extension of me. For example, [low-talking] is a pet peeve of mine; Baby Voice Darius is just an exaggerated version it. The same goes for J. I have way more friends than she does and I'm not as insecure, but I've definitely dealt with people not getting me.
J's awkwardness is almost painful at times. How did you know so many people would relate to her?
Well, I have four brothers and sisters, and we're all awkward. That's where I get my humor from; we're one big awkward-ass family. And then there's my mother. She really is the mother of all awkwardness.
Your mom is awkward? I need an example.
OK, this one is sad: A family friend's son tragically passed away at 35, of cancer. Because my mom took so long to get ready, we were running late for his funeral. We showed up in the middle of the service, rolling seven-deep. Everybody turned around to look at us, the preacher included. After we'd all gotten seated, my brother picks up a program, sees that it's for an elderly lady named Odessa Mae Brown! All seven of us had to get up and interrupt this woman's service again. It was so awkward.
That's beyond awkward; that's excruciating. You know a lot of women in the entertainment industry wouldn't tell a story like that in an interview. [Laughs.] I do wonder how you're going to maintain what's so original and quirky about your work as you grow.
That's the biggest thing I'm struggling with right now. I didn't realize at first how important the vision of the show was, and how much I love the cast. I'm coming to terms with the fact that if we sell it to a network, a lot of things will be out of my control. Tracy and I have talked about keeping this on the Web until we have real leverage. We just have to see where it goes.
I can't imagine a show like this originating on television–network or cable. Everybody looks and acts so–regular.
Half the people in the show are my friends! I knew Tracy, who plays Nina, from college. I went to high school with Tristen Winger, who plays Baby Voice Darius. My little brother, Enimal, does all of the scoring and he guest stars. I just had to tap into my resources and carve out this Webspace because studios aren't supporting our work. The reality is that studios don't like to make black movies. No matter how good your script is, they're trying to replicate Tyler Perry's work, put out his work, or just do movies like “The Help.”
You graduated from Stanford with a poly-sci and African American history degree. Any other observations about Hollywood's race problem?
I would say that right now, Hollywood doesn't understand race and they're not considering it. It's up to us to acknowledge and combat the stereotypes because mainstream media just don't care. They're making money either way.
It seems like you've found another way. Do you have industry people trying to figure out how you've pulled this off?
A couple of people have asked me, but it's not like they're falling all over me to get this made. I know if I was a white girl, people would be on me tough. But I'm not a white girl. [Laughs.]
Very true. [Laughs.] To switch gears: Anyone who watches ABG knows how much you adore Donald Glover. You've shouted him out in two episodes and talked about him in previous interviews. Has he reached out to you?
Yes! He follows me on Twitter and he even asked for one of my t-shirts. When I found out he was following me, I started screaming. My boyfriend was on the couch looking at me like I was crazy. [Laughs.]
OK, so we know you love “Community,” and you've cited the British version of “The Office” as an influence in previous interviews. Are there any shows you watch and say to yourself, ‘Wow, I would never, ever want my work to be like this.'?
[Laughs.] You're trying to get me in trouble! This industry is so small, I'm learning to censor myself more.
Well, you do describe yourself as a director, writer, editor–and messtalker on your site…
True. Yes, there are shows that I don't want to emulate. Let's just say a lot of them are on TBS. [Laughs.]
On a serious note, do you have any advice for people who want to create their own Web productions?
I would recommend that people tap into their network of people. If you have talented family and friends, work with them before you look elsewhere because they'll be reliable and consistent. And make sure you use that network to get the word out as well.

“The BJP practices the politics of blood. They don't see anything but power. Power at any cost… They won't hesitate to spill blood if they find it necessary to usurp power,” said Rahul Gandhi at Dehradun on Sunday.
Aggressive words, but vague and inconsequential in typical Rahul fashion. It neither takes the communalism debate forward nor does it singe the BJP in the way he would like. Similar words have been uttered so many times earlier by so many other leaders that it makes little sense to repeat these.
If the Congress vice-president is serious about making communalism a talking point in the run-up to the elections and take the fight into the BJP camp, he must come with something more concrete against the BJP – for example, the party's deep connection with the Sangh Parivar and the mutually beneficial arrangement between the two where one plays the Hindu card openly while the other supports or stays calculatedly aloof from it depending on political convenience.
If Rahul is keen on nailing the BJP on its communal predilection – Hindu majoritarianism to be more direct - he can start with some no-nonsense questions.
These would leave Modi, the BJP's prime ministerial choice, most vulnerable. Is he what he claims he is or is he only a front office manager doing the job for the back office manipulators? If his handlers in the back office have a communal agenda to push, can Modi stop it? This question is particularly problematic since the BJP's prime ministerial candidate has been handpicked by the mother organization, the RSS.
The fundamental flaw in the approach to Hindu communalism from the political class has been to treat the BJP as separate from the RSS and its extremist fringe. It defies explanation since the connection is so clear. It could be deliberate.
Whatever it is, if Rahul wants to hit the BJP hard he has to be more combative. Bland remarks like ‘politics of blood' do not work anymore, particularly when the media and some influential sections are busy giving a ‘clean chit' to both Modi and his party. He has to come up with stronger arguments against communalism and he must be more direct in his attack. If he cannot do that, there is no point him raising the issue.
Secularism is a valid talking point in India – it has been so for the last more than 60 years and it won't stop being so. While the ordinary masses, with their great ability to separate the religious from the political and the communal from the religious, have proved to be a strong bulwark against the progress of any communal agenda in the country, the impressionable urban, educated class appears particularly vulnerable now.
Obviously, the secular political parties have not done enough to convince them. Modi and the BJP have a lot of answering to do when it comes to Hindtutva, but nobody seems keen on asking the right questions.
If he wants to be a serious challenger to the ascendance of political Hindutva, Rahul must be ready to ask the difficult questions to the BJP. He cannot afford to play safe.

The Senate's leading conservative trio -- Rand Paul (R-Ky.), Ted Cruz (R-Texas) and Mike Lee (R-Utah) – are threatening to filibuster the Senate Democrats' gun violence legislation slated for consideration next month, leaving open the possibility of marathon speeches in the mold of Paul's nearly 13-hour filibuster on the CIA's drone policy.
The senators sent a brief letter to Majority Leader Harry M. Reid (D-Nev.) outlining their opposition to “any legislation that would infringe on the American people's constitutional right to bear arms,” signaling they will oppose the procedural vote to begin debate on the gun package when the Senate returns from its current two-week spring break.
"We will oppose the motion to proceed to any legislation that will serve as a vehicle for any addition gun restrictions," the three wrote.
It's not clear yet whether the effort would be another talking filibuster, like the one Paul led against CIA director John Brennan's nomination last month, or a silent filibuster that would simply require Democrats to get 60 votes to proceed to an up-or-down vote.
Cruz spokeswoman Catherine Frazier says her boss "is prepared to use any procedural means necessary to prevent stricter gun control laws."
The letter can be found here.
Reid announced last week that he was cobbling together several of the proposals approved by the Senate Judiciary Committee earlier this month into one legislative package that will be debated on the floor for several weeks. Those proposals include a Democratic draft of a new universal background check on all legal gun purchases; school safety provisions; tougher new federal laws on gun trafficking.
He set aside a strict new ban on assault weapons and a limit on gun clip sizes, which had been aggressively promoted by Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) since December's mass shootings at a Connecticut elementary school.
GOP leaders have previously not objected to beginning debate on the legislation, as the conservative trio is opposed to doing, and several Republicans continue to work with Democrats on coming up with a bipartisan compromise on background check legislation.
Reid's spokesman said the Paul-Cruz-Lee letter was “not surprising” but missed the mark on the nation's reaction to the Connecticut murders.
“It's outrageous that these senators are unwilling to even engage in a debate over gun violence in America. No matter your opinion on this issue, we should all be able to agree with President Obama when he said that the children and teachers of Newtown, along with all other Americans who have been victims of gun violence, at least deserve a vote,” said Adam Jentleson, Reid's spokesman.
Under new rules approved at the start of the calendar year, Reid could conceivably move around the threatened filibuster by bypassing the motion to proceed and jump onto the legislation. In doing so, he would have to guarantee that Republicans get to offer at least two amendments to the bill. That new procedure has not been used yet, and doing so could thwart any bipartisan momentum toward getting a deal that a large number of senators supported.
[JURIST] The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) [advocacy website] called on US President Barack Obama [official website] early Wednesday morning to shut down [press release] the Guantanamo Bay [JURIST backgrounder] military prison, even as it congratulated him on his re-election victory. Anthony Romero, executive director of the ACLU, urged Obama to “make good the promise he made four years ago to close the prison at Guantanamo Bay.” He also encouraged Obama to put an end to practices such as warrantless surveillance, drone strikes and indefinite detention:
We congratulate President Obama on his re-election. This is his opportunity to reaffirm our constitutional principles and the fundamental American values of due process, respect for the rule of law and individual freedom. It is a time to once again be a nation where we can be both safe and free.
Obama won reelection Tuesday over Republican challenger Mitt Romney and will serve until 2016.
During his 2008 campaign, Obama stated that closing the Guantanamo Bay military prison would be a priority for his first term. Shortly after he assumed office, Obama issued an executive order [JURIST report] for the closure of the site within one year. According to Forum contributor David Frakt, the Obama administration is not solely to blame [JURIST op-ed] for Guantanamo Bay remaining open. The US Congress has, since 2009, “passed a series of increasingly stringent spending restrictions which have made it virtually impossible to transfer most detainees out of Guantanamo.” Other scholars, including Forum contributor Jonathan Hafetz, have raised concerns [JURIST op-ed] about how the failure to close Guantanamo Bay “has helped justify the policies of arbitrary detention and torture that spurred its creation in the first place.”
Ryan was born in Refugio, Texas.
His birth name is actually Lynn Nolan Ryan, Jr.
He delivered copies of The Houston Post every morning for several years.
He was selected in the 12th round of the MLB's amateur draft in 1965 by the New York Mets.
Ryan was nicknamed the "Ryan Express" by the New York media after he helped the Mets in 1969 upset the favored Baltimore Orioles in the World Series.
He signed with the Astros in 1979, making him the first major leaguer to earn $1 million annually.
Ryan set a record with 3,509 strikeouts in 1983.
He entered The Guinness Book of World Records with the fastest pitch throwing 100.9 miles per hour.
Ryan is the only MLB player to have his uniform retired by three different teams.
He launched the Nolan Rylan Tender Aged Beef label in 2000.
Most of you know him as the "Ryan Express." We're celebrating one of our favorite Houston athletes with these fun facts.Ryan was also part of what some may call one of the most infamous brawls in baseball history with Robin Ventura during a game at Arlington Stadium in 1993.

Our own [Eliot] dug this one up from the grave. While the recipe has been online for a while, do you know many 10 year olds who made their own Aerogel, that wonderful insulator that's essentially gelled air? [William] made some(cache) for his science project in 2002. He started with Silbond H5, a combination of ethyl alcohol and ethyl polysilicate. You can get the MSDS after a painless email registration on the Silbond website. After the gel is formed you have to soak it in an alcohol bath to make sure all water has been removed from the structure. Then the gel is placed in a drying chamber. Liquid CO2 is forced into the chamber to displace all the alcohol in the chamber and the structure. Once the the alcohol is gone the supercritical drying phase begins. The temperature is raised to 90degF and the pressure is regulated to 1050psi. At this point the liquid CO2 in the gel structure takes on gas properties (looses surface tension) and leaves the silica structure. All that remains in the chamber is your new Aerogel which is 99% empty space and 1000 times less dense than glass.
Of course, if you're lazy, you can buy some here.
Let's provide a little bit of background to those that may be unfamiliar with the situation. On Thursday, June 23, 2016, a referendum known as Brexit will be held to determine whether or not Britain will remain in the European Union.
As for its origins, the EU is an economic and political “agreement” between 28 European countries that was conceived after World War II amidst the destruction and financial devastation that ensued during the post-war years. The idea at the time was to encourage trade among the various member states and discourage going to war with one another given the economic benefits that would result. This logic likewise led to the idea of “free circulation” where goods and people could freely move around without borders while also eliminating the need for visas.
During the 2015 general elections, Prime Minister David Cameron ran under the campaign promise that he would hold a referendum to allow the British people to voice their opinion. This was a result of an ever increasing amount of calls from conservatives to give the country an opportunity to formally weigh in, since the British people have not had a say on the matter since 1975.
Over 40 years have gone by since the last referendum was held, so it's within reason to assume that the political, social, and economic landscape of Britain has changed somewhat in the last four decades. Although one could pay credence to the notion of establishing the EU in the context of a post World War society, it simply does not benefit Britain to stay in for a number of reasons.
Let's analyze some of the erroneous arguments that are often spouted from the pro-EU side.
This Won't Be The First Time A Country Has Left
“This has never happened before! It could lead to chaos!”
False. This is probably one of the weakest arguments because it just reverts to a “doomsday” scenario instead of arguing with facts. In actuality, Greenland held a referendum in 1982 and voted 52% to 48% in favor of leaving the EU. After going through the process of exit negotiations, Greenlanders were able to take control of their country's history and say NO.
A large portion of Greenland's population relies on the fishing industry for their livelihood. They resented being told by Brussels what they had to do and exactly how much fish they were allowed to take out of their waters. Furthermore, Greenland's fishing industry improved after its exit according to industry figures.
Britain Will See Job Growth And Savings Of Considerable Money
“Jobs will be lost, and the economy will be damaged!”
False. More than 300 of the country's biggest business leaders and executives published a letter to the Telegraph last week stating that Brussels' red tape stifles growth and undermines economic growth. Additionally, they stated that Brexit would enable them to create more jobs.
Lord Farmer, the former head of the Conservative party, lambasted the globalist fear-mongering: “Warnings of disaster if we leave are misguided. Britain, the world's fifth-biggest economy, should be confident that others will want to trade freely with it especially if, like the EU, they already do so. Europe has a surplus of nearly £70bn with us and no reason to put up barriers.”
Another area where Britain would see immediate economic savings relates to EU membership fees. That's right. You didn't think they called it a “club” just for fun, did you? Britain is one of 10 member states who pay more into the EU budget then they get out of it. Britain currently sends a whopping £350m, the equivalent of 50% of England's school budget, to Brussels on a weekly basis. That money can easily be put back into the British economy by reinvesting the funds in different industry sectors to stimulate growth and create jobs.
In the long-term, Britain would save billions of pounds in imposed membership fees that are most likely squandered in other areas of the superstate that is fed by the insatiable appetite of the Brussels bureaucratic machine. Some think tanks have even posited that Britain's GDP could rise by 1.6% in 2030 under the assumption that the UK renegotiates good trade deals with the US, the EU, China, and other major economic powers.
What should come to no surprise to the reader is that the same Telegraph article mentioned above discusses how hundreds of thousands of pounds from foreign companies and America's biggest banks—such as Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, and Morgan Stanley—were donated to the Remain campaign. Globalists sure love to take care of each other, don't they?
Stronger Borders And Immigration Regulation
“The EU border policies don't really affect the UK, since it's not part of Schengen!”
False. EU law stipulates that Britain must allow EU citizens from other member states to live in the country. As we have unfortunately witnessed over the past few months following the tragic events in Paris and Brussels, the lack of strong border controls within the Eurozone has led to radicalized terrorists easily sliding their way back into the continent after receiving training in Syria.
Loading...
Although the UK technically isn't part of the Schengen Agreement, which allows for passport free movement in the EU bloc, the other 26 states that do belong are responsible for vetting those who enter in from non-EU countries. Are we naive enough to believe that every single one of those countries is doing a thorough job at gathering intelligence?
The fact that terrorists Abdeslam and Abaaoud were able to slip back into Belgium the same night of the Paris attacks is proof enough that the EU borders are porous at the very least and flimsy at the very best. The herculean task of keeping tabs on 400 million people throughout a 1.6 million square mile area across these 26 countries has shown to be unreliable. Free movement on such a massive scale simply cannot be controlled effectively. Keep this in mind: one illegal-border hopping into the EU would not in any way prevent someone from illegally continuing to cross into numerous other states without detection.
Amidst the continuing migrant debacle, the European Commission has also become more brazen and blatantly hostile with its demands. This tends to be typical of tyrannical rulers realizing that they are losing their grips on power. For example, the EC unveiled plans in May to impose a draconian penalty of €250,000 per rejected migrant that countries refuse to take in. That's a pretty convenient “deal” if your long-term plan is to flood the European market with tens of millions of refugees that will drastically push down wages in the labor market.
Another laughable move recently came from the European Court of Justice, as it deemed that foreign criminals could avoid being deported from the UK if they were to be placed in overcrowded prisons back home, which would be a “violation of their human rights.” Instead of having these criminals sent back to serve their sentence in their countries of origins, the British tax payer will now have to foot the bill to ensure these thugs are catered to in a cushier penitentiary system.
Let's also not forget that the European Commission is currently in the process of striking a deal with Turkey to allow for visa-free travel within the EU under the condition that the latter sharply cut the flow of illegal migrants into Greece. Even though the negotiations are at a stalemate over Turkey's refusal to amend its anti-terror laws, I do believe that Britons should be asking themselves the following question: would it really be in your country's best interest to remain in the EU pending the very real possibility that a country of 75 million people that borders war torn Syria and Iraq, along with sporadic territory under control of the Islamic State, be granted visa-free travel?
Conclusion
Brexit is the wake-up call that the rest of the Europe desperately needs. There's a very real reason that far-right parties are surging all across the continent: people are fed up with pro-globalist economic and migratory policies that do not benefit them or their families. Furthermore, the working class is sick and tired of the political elite dictating and shoving policy down their throat from Brussels. Have a look at how Britons took Obama's last visit to the UK when he sternly urged them to stay in the EU:
Roughly a month away from the Brexit referendum, the writing is on the wall. A vote for Brexit is a vote for nationalism and sovereignty. Perhaps even more importantly, a vote for the UK exiting the Euro zone would be the spark of confidence in nationalism that will serve as a model to fellow Europeans who are grappling with a migratory invasion of epic proportions, porous border security, and a crippled economy beset by sluggish wage growth.

Texas High School Student Shows Off Homemade Clock, Gets Handcuffed
Enlarge this image toggle caption Google Maps
A 14-year-old boy says he was just trying to show off his engineering skill when he brought a digital clock he had made to his new high school in Irving, Texas. But Ahmed Mohamed was detained and reportedly suspended from school, after a teacher thought that his clock looked like a bomb.
The aspiring engineer repeatedly said that it was not, in fact, a bomb. But the teacher and the principal of MacArthur High School were alarmed, and they called police, who questioned Mohamed, handcuffed him and led him out of school. He was then fingerprinted before being released to his family, who say he received a three-day suspension from school.
Update at 1:40 p.m. ET: Obama Invites Mohamed To White House
"Cool clock, Ahmed," President Obama wrote in a tweet around midday Wednesday. "Want to bring it to the White House? We should inspire more kids like you to like science. It's what makes America great."
Our original post continues:
A photograph from Monday shows Mohamed wearing both a NASA T-shirt and handcuffs as officers escort him through a hallway in Irving, which is about 10 miles west of Dallas.
The police tell local news outlets that while they acknowledge that Mohamed didn't try to perpetrate a bomb hoax, they were also unsatisfied with his explanation.
"He would simply only tell us that it was a clock," police spokesman James McLellan says. "He didn't offer an explanation as to what it was for, why he created this device, why he brought it to school."

Responding to questions about the incident, the Irving school district released a statement in which it said that students and staff at its schools are encouraged to report any suspicious behavior.
No criminal charges were filed — but Mohamed's family says the school and police overreacted. And the case has raised questions over whether Mohamed was treated with particular suspicion because of ethnic and religious bias.
"I think this wouldn't even be a question if his name wasn't Ahmed Mohamed," Alia Salem of the Dallas-Fort Worth chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations tells local news WFAA. "He is an excited kid who is very bright and wants to share it with his teachers."
Representatives from CAIR will reportedly be attending a meeting later today between Mohamed's parents and school officials.
In interviews with local media outlets, Mohamed says he wanted to show the engineering teacher there what he'd done over the weekend: take apart a clock and rebuild it inside a pencil case. Resembling a small briefcase, the case has a hologram of a tiger on it.
"It was the first time I brought an invention to school to show a teacher," Mohamed tells WFAA in an interview taped in his bedroom, where circuits and wires sit on shelves alongside basketballs and footballs.
Here's how things unfolded, according to The Dallas Morning News:
"He showed it to his engineering teacher first thing Monday morning and didn't get quite the reaction he'd hoped for. " 'He was like, "That's really nice," Ahmed said. "I would advise you not to show any other teachers." ' "He kept the clock inside his school bag in English class, but the teacher complained when the alarm beeped in the middle of a lesson. Ahmed brought his invention up to show her afterward. " 'She was like, it looks like a bomb,' he said. " 'I told her, "It doesn't look like a bomb to me." ' "The teacher kept the clock. When the principal and a police officer pulled Ahmed out of sixth period, he suspected he wouldn't get it back."
YouTube
Ahmed Mohamed also gave the newspaper his account of the day in a video in which he says, "It made me feel like I wasn't human. It made me feel like I was a criminal."

We were riding around in the back, in the bed, and Judah said, “Hey!” The truck stopped. He launched himself over the edge of the bed of the truck and into the weeds, carrying a shovel. The weeds were thick and green that Spring. The sorghum had sprouted and the beans were up with pairs of leaves. He waded into the weeds, his boot steps making sucking sounds in the mud and his shovel raised like a spear.
“Thought I saw a snake,” he said.
“What kind of snake?” we said.
“Think it was a copperhead.”
“Wha'd it look like?” we asked, and Judah, the older boy, probably 15 or 16, said it was kind of copper-red and he saw it crossing, black against the bleach-white gravel, a big, wriggling snake.
“Maybe I runned it over with the truck,” said Brother Dale, the man who was driving that day. The older boy with the shovel said, “Maybe,” and said, “It was movin' fast.” And then we were silent, watching him hunt for the snake.
The brother got a hoe, went to the edge of the road, and whacked at the edge of the weeds. He swung it like a scythe. He nicked and thrashed a thin line of weeds, popping off pod heads and breaking thin stems, stripping the skin off some of the thicker stalks. If the boy with the shovel was overeager, reckless, looking for a trophy to kill, then the man was overcautious, like he wanted to look like he was helping without going anywhere near where a snake might be. Like he knew he was the man and he could take credit for whatever the boy brought back but he'd be blamed for whatever went wrong.
“Y'all stay there,” Brother Dale said to us in the truck, “me and him'll get this.” And he went to whacking away and watching the boy with the shovel.
There were rules about snakes on the land. We were supposed to kill them. We were supposed to cut off their heads and burry the heads while the mouths still gasped, fangs stretching out for something to bite as the shovel slid under and scooped them into a hole. There were snake skulls buried all across that bottomland. Most of the snakes were poisonous. Not all of them, but most, and we were trying to farm. We were trying to go back to the land, learning again how to plow and plant, grow and pick. So there was a war on the snakes. Anyone who killed one was a hero, reaping a bounty of praise. To kill a snake was to take dominion, to fight back, to go back to where we lived by nature's laws and where the righteous bring forth right by force.
We always heard stories about snakes on the land. We heard stories about good dogs-but dumb dogs-getting killed by snake heads left laying around, and about grown men making tourniquets they sterilized with piss. I never saw anyone bit, though. It never happened during the five years I was there. Now I wonder if it wasn't the metaphor that motivated the war on snakes. Snakes were evil, and we were the righteous, fighting them with gardening tools. Satan was a snake and doubt was a snake and questions, a snake. The Devil's deception was a snake with a waving tongue. So we were told to hunt them down. We were supposed to be the Last Days people of God and we were supposed to be making the new Eden out of the land by the river in Texas. We didn't have any enemies, though, no enemies except questions and unseen spirits and people's secret doubts about the inspiration of the prophets. So we fought what we could see; we fought the snakes.
We got out of trucks and attacked weeds to hunt down Satan. We tried to hack the head off deceptions that made us question authority, and doubts that made us wonder. When we went into weeds, off the road and into the mud to try and find a snake to kill, we were trying to demonstrate our spiritual state, to show the men who spoke for God that we got it, that we were snake hunters.
We were afraid, of course. The fear felt like mud in our stomachs. In the weeds with a shovel, fear went icy up your spine and you strained your eyes, strained your ears, and tried to find the snake. We were afraid of getting bit, but also of failing, of being dumb like the dog who got venom in the face from the severed head of a snake. We were afraid of being made an example of stupid, of letting the snakes slither around on us, slide around behind us and bite us and demonstrate to everybody, the men and the prophets and girls and our fathers and God, that we were stupid and the snake got us.
So the older boy with the shovel went hunting. Judah went wading into the green weeds and over to the edge of the sorghum. He went wading into the green weeds and over to the edge of the sorghum and we could hear when he moved 'cause the mud slurped at his feet. But there was nothing, nothing but weeds and sorghum, bottomland mud and a ditch of standing water. Brother Dale at the edge was starting to worry and he stopped and said he thought the boy had better come back now. “He probably shoulda better, did he see it? Musta got away.” But then Judah said weren't there women coming to work in the next field over in the afternoon and he wouldn't want to let the snake go free for them would he? And then the brother was really worried, with the responsibility and the metaphoric meaning of snakes, and he didn't know what to do. He stood there, looking helpless. “Do you see it?” he said, but there was nothing.
In the truck where we waited in the bed, in the back, I sat back down on the wheel well, and we gave up on the snake and went to waiting. The other two boys went back to arguing about Fords and Chevys. The younger boys were always arguing about trucks, always arguing brands, and it seemed like when the Antichrist did finally come, they'd still be trying to settle whether Ford sucked more or Chevy did. We sat there, in the Spring sun, and the one said it did and the other it didn't and the one said the other didn't know and the other said he did and what about blue truck that'd broken down? They would argue like that forever, ignoring everything else and arguing endlessly, so I stayed silent.
Brother Dale said to come on back and Judah did, still insisting that what he'd seen was big. But there was nothing, neither snake nor revelation in the muddy weeds, and we drove on. I sat and looked at the road as we left it behind, watching where the sun-white gravel went into the oaks by the river, where the trees snuck roots out into the water and drank. In the distance I could see a house, calm up under the shade, but there was no one there.

CARLTON COLE has revealed that he has rejected a move to the United States in order to try and impress Celtic manager Ronny Deila to earn a deal at Parkhead.
The former West Ham striker was a surprise attendee of the Celts' 6-0 demolishing of Dundee on Sunday and that fuelled rumours that he was a signing target.
It has since emerged that he will be training with Dela's squad with a view to impressing and earning a permanent deal.
The 31-year-old said: "Glasgow has surprised me, I've never been to Scotland before so hopefully we can do a deal. I'm going to go and train and see how I like it and see how the boys are.
"I was almost going to MLS instead of coming here so hopefully I do like it here."
Cole turns 32 next month but he insists there are plenty of miles left in his career, adding: "Yeah of course that's why I'm trying to take it in this morning, have a little walk around and see how I like the place.
On the Premiership mauling of Paul Hartley's Dundee, Cole commented: "It was really interesting. I thought Dundee didn't come out and put up a good challenge but credit to the Celtic players. It was mind over matter because they had the midweek game against Ajax and they came up trumps and it was really intense."
Speaking about a potential contract for Cole, Deila said: "We will have talks with him and see him in training as well. We will see then if something is going to happen or not.
"I think he is a very good football player. He has shown in the Premier League and in the Championship that he can score goals. He is different from what we have."
Cole is open to sign for any club, having been a free agent before September 2nd, and several English clubs are reported to be chasing the attacker - but it seems Cole is set on a switch north of the border.
Microsoft has been using a deceptive tactic to dupe Windows 7 and Windows 8.1 users into upgrading to Windows 10 for at least the last two months, according to the company's website.
An oft-revised support document that Computerworld cited in a May 16 story about Microsoft's aggressive upgrade practices spelled out the workings of a pop-up notification that Windows 7 and 8.1 users had been seeing. The notification told those customers -- primarily consumers, but also many small-to-mid-sized businesses -- that the free Windows 10 upgrade had been pre-scheduled by Microsoft.
The same document also acknowledged that those who clicked the red "X" in the upper-right corner of the pop-up were approving the scheduled upgrade.
"If you click on OK or on the red 'X', you're all set for the upgrade and there is nothing further to do," the document stated.
The problem was that that operation -- clicking the X -- has been a decades-old convention in graphical user interfaces (GUIs) for simply closing a window. To users, shutting a window by clicking the X tells the operating system or application to remove the notification or close the window frame without expressing an opinion, without selecting an option or without calling for an action.
In an application like Microsoft Word, for example, clicking the X closes the window: If Word did not remind the user to save his or her work, all content would be lost.
Plainly put, users have been "trained" by operating systems, including Windows, to click the "close" button to do just that, and nothing more. (In OS X, the action is conducted a bit differently -- one clicks on the red, left-most button at the top of a window -- but the behavior is identical.)
Yet Microsoft bucked convention by instead equating closing the window with approving the scheduled upgrade. Because there are no explanations to that effect in the pop-up -- only in the support document -- it's highly likely that the vast majority of users who clicked on the X to make the notification disappear had no idea that they were, in fact, authorizing an upgrade to Windows 10.
But while Computerworld first mentioned the practice on May 16, Microsoft has been counter-intuitively interpreting the action for months.
A version of the same support document found in a search engine cache last week revealed that Microsoft has been using the tactic since at least late March: The cached document carried a "Last Review" date stamp of March 23.
That document also noted the Bizarro World way of construing a click-on-X.
"Your Windows 10 upgrade will occur at the scheduled time if you close this window without either selecting Upgrade now or by using the link to change the upgrade schedule or cancel the scheduled upgrade," the document read [emphasis added].
It's unclear how long before March 23 Microsoft was defining an X-click as approving the pre-scheduled Windows 10 upgrade.
Not surprisingly, the reaction from users has been brutal.
Long-time Microsoft watcher and blogger Paul Thurrott today called the practice "indefensible" and said "I've had it." Brad Chacos, a senior editor at PCworld -- like Computerworld, a publication owned by IDG -- dubbed it a "dirty trick" and related how his wife, a dedicated Windows user, was so angry at the scheme that she had started shopping for a Mac Mini from Apple.
Even self-professed fans of Windows thought Microsoft had gone too far in pressing people to upgrade.
"Windows 10 is, in my opinion, a great OS, and the fact that it's free to upgrade from 7 and 8 is just awesome," said someone identified as zeynl on Sunday in a long Reddit thread on the X-clicking practice. "But the fact that Microsoft will go this far to get it onto peoples' systems is disgusting."
"I like Windows 10, but this...is just wrong," added TheJewelOfJool last week, also on Reddit.
"Wow. Even for Microsoft, that's a new low," said AI221 on Reddit today.
Some, though, essentially told everyone to suck it up and take the upgrade. "I find it amusing that people are fighting this so hard for nothing," countered XxSliphxX yesterday. "[Windows] 10 is pretty awesome just f****** update and stop being massive hipsters about it."
Within the pop-up, the only way to avoid the upgrade, according to Microsoft, is to click the one-word link highlighting "here" in the line, "Click here to change upgrade schedule or cancel scheduled upgrade."
The countdown to Bloomington Gold 2015 currently stands at just over 2 weeks. One of the additions to the show in recent years is the Gold Autocross. Now, as the granddaddy of all Corvette shows is set to make its debut at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway, Bloomington Gold has announced that Lingenfelter Performance Engineering and RideTech will be sponsoring one of their newest driving events.
The 2015 edition of Bloomington Gold takes place at the legendary Indianapolis Motor Speedway Thursday June 25th through Saturday June 27th.
This year the Bloomington Gold Autocross will be held each day of the Bloomington Gold show. Corvette owners and drivers of any skill level can participate in the event. For safety, helmets will be required. Those who don't have their own can grab one on site. Registration for the Gold Autocross will be held during check-in each day from 8am to 9am. The inaugural run of each day will take place promptly at 9am.
Participation isn't just limited to Corvette drivers. Attendees will also have the chance all 3 days to participate in ride-alongs in Lingenfelter-powered Corvettes.
“Lingenfelter is dedicated to developing a continually-expanding line of engine components for Corvette owners who want to achieve maximum performance” said Ken Lingenfelter, owner, Lingenfelter Performance Engineering.
As you'll recall, Lingenfelter and RideTech recently combined forces on the 48-Hour Corvette Build. There, Lingenfelter supplied a 650hp LS7 crate engine and RideTech provided the shop space and suspension products to help turn a C3 Corvette into a high-end track weapon. That vehicle is currently tearing up the Goodguys autocross as well as the OPTIMA Ultimate Street Car events.
“RideTech wants to help Corvette enthusiasts have some real fun with their cars, to drive them as they were designed to be driven. Partnering with Corvette market leader Lingenfelter Performance to bring an event like this to the most prestigious Corvette show in the world was a natural,” said RideTech president Bret Voelkel.
Bloomington Gold 2015 will take place Thursday June 25th through Saturday June 27th. The event will be taking over the entire IMS complex for the three day show. That includes the tracks, the garages, and even the golf course. Make your travel plans now as this is sure to be the best Bloomington Gold show yet.

NEW YORK (Fortune) -- It was already ominous enough that the U.S. budget deficit nearly tripled to $455 billion in the fiscal year that ended in September. Now, even conservative projections show that it is on course to explode into the stratosphere, exceeding the $1 trillion mark in the current fiscal year - and most likely, by a wide margin.
So, how alarmed should we be by this bleak prospect? The rational answer is that the soaring budget deficit is unavoidable and, in fact, necessary to help stabilize the economy through some extraordinarily difficult times.
Let's take a closer look at the issue - both the causes of the deficit and the concerns being raised by some fiscal conservatives.
The runaway deficit is the result of the convergence of three major factors:
1) The recession, which reduces tax revenues and increases certain types of spending related to higher unemployment and other welfare programs.
2) The steadily rising costs of the effort to address the financial crisis that burst onto the scene in September (takeovers of Fannie Mae (FNM, Fortune 500), Freddie Mac (FRE, Fortune 500), and AIG (AIG, Fortune 500), as well as capital injections into the banking system).
3) The soon-to-be announced, highly ambitious fiscal-stimulus package by the incoming Obama administration. The precise size of such a package remains unspecified, although "semi-official" hints have been given that it may be in the $600 billion to $800 billion range over several years.
All of the above forces represent an inescapable reality. Neither the recession nor the financial crisis were developments that could have been brushed aside. (The current recession is expected to continue till mid-2009, according to the consensus among economists, which would make it the longest contraction since the Great Depression.)
Although specific aspects of how the bailout funds have been used so far can be open to question, not undertaking a massive program of stabilizing the financial system in the last few months was never really an option, as it would have exposed the entire U.S. economy to a potentially catastrophic outcome.
Similarly, the Obama administration's stimulus package is not an elective development either. The need to undertake such aggressive spending is imperative, given the severely crippled state of economic activity.
The alternative, a smaller deficit based on more restrained spending, would almost certainly lead to an unthinkable outcome for the U.S economy. In a situation presenting itself so plainly, the current rumblings by some Congressional Republicans about the surging size of the deficit sound hollow and misguided, the product of rigid ideological adherence to the otherwise sound concept of fiscal discipline.
To be sure, the U.S. budget deficit is likely to approach 10% of GDP in the current fiscal year, an unprecedented rate; the previous high was 6% of GDP in fiscal year 1983 and the generally accepted rule is that a deficit should stay within 2% to 3% of the country's GDP. (By comparison, the deficits in the euro zone countries are capped at 3%, with some lenience only allowed recently as a result of the financial crisis.)
The main risks usually associated with a high deficit are:
1) The potential that the massive amount of borrowing that the government needs to undertake to finance it can squeeze the private sector out of the credit markets, therefore creating an intense competition for limited funds that can push interest rates higher.
However, such a risk is actually minimal in the current environment, where the weak economy has severely dampened the credit needs of the private sector and foreign investors seem to have, at least for now, an impressive appetite for U.S. Treasury securities that are issued to finance the deficit.
2) The risk that the deficit will cause inflation. This is true only when the Federal Reserve purchases large amounts of the newly-issued debt directly from the Treasury, a process called monetization. There is no serious evidence suggesting that the Fed is engaging in such large-scale operations and, in the past, it has consistently refrained from doing so.
The Fed has certainly not been shy about injecting massive amounts of liquidity into the banking system in the last few months, but this process is totally unrelated to the size of the budget deficit and it is meant to address a very different aspect of the current predicament for the U.S economy: unclogging the frozen credit pipelines.
3) Large budget deficits add to the national debt, causing ever-increasing interest payments and, therefore, representing a burden for future generations.
While no sane person can deny the nearly immoral aspect of that burden that is being passed on to the next generation, at the same time it's probably fair to say that the next generation would also have a keen interest in inheriting a functioning, thriving economy and not one that has been decimated by years of contraction caused by a blind adherence to the sacred principle of fiscal discipline.
Let's make no mistake: The surging budget deficits are not a pretty picture or a totally benign one either, and no argument can be made in favor of a more cavalier attitude toward fiscal discipline in normal or semi-normal times.
But these are extraordinary times and the deficits are just an unavoidable consequence - particularly considering the alternative.

1 World Health Organization WHO guidelines on ethical issues in public health surveillance. On June 23, 2017, WHO issued the first international ethics guidelines on public health surveillance ( appendix ),helping to fill a key gap in knowledge regarding this important practice.
2 United Nations Sustainable development goals. Surveillance constitutes the foundation of outbreak and epidemic responses, but it is important not only for infectious disease but also for understanding the global challenge of non-communicable diseases. Surveillance can help to create accountable institutions by providing information about health and its determinants and an evidentiary basis for establishing and evaluating public health policy. Surveillance will be central to the success of the Sustainable Development Goalsproposed by the UN. When the results of surveillance are shared with populations and policymakers in a timely and appropriate manner, they can serve as a tool for advocacy. Perhaps most crucially, surveillance contributes to reducing inequities; the needs of populations in which suffering occurs, particularly when this suffering is unfair, unjust, and preventable, cannot be addressed if these populations are not first made visible.
Yet surveillance has sometimes been the subject of pitched battles. Because surveillance can involve practices such as name-based reporting, it can trigger profound concerns about intrusions on privacy, discrimination, and stigmatisation, particularly in the absence of public trust that names will be secured and not inadvertently disclosed, or that aggregate data will only be released in a sensitive manner.
Just as often, however, the failure to undertake public health surveillance has generated political and ethical controversy because of concerns that “what does not get counted does not count.”
Despite the existence of landmark international guidelines on the ethics of research, including epidemiological studies, and specific ethical guidelines for surveillance of specific diseases in specific countries, there has never been a comprehensive international ethics framework governing public health surveillance that considers risk factors, environmental conditions, infectious diseases, non-communicable diseases, outbreak situations, and national borders.
3 World Health Organization Global networks of WHO Collaborating Centres for Bioethics. WHO's International Guidelines on the Ethics of Public Health Surveillance have been developed by an international group of experts in surveillance, epidemiological research, bioethics, public health ethics, and human rights. The authors of these guidelines combine expertise in leading research institutions, representing major non-governmental organisations that either undertake surveillance or are involved with surveillance-related advocacy. Among others, experts from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, and WHO provided vital technical support to ensure that the guidelines were reflective of the actual procedures used for and issues involved in data collection, analysis, and dissemination. The Global Network of WHO Collaborating Centres for Bioethicsinitiated this project.
These new guidelines were motivated by a set of core ethical and policy questions, as follows: (1) what is the ethical obligation to undertake public health surveillance; (2) what are the risks of conducting disease surveillance, and how should such risks be balanced against population-level benefits; (3) when and how must relevant communities be engaged in the development of surveillance plans; (4) how should the confidentiality of surveillance data be protected; (5) what are the ethical obligations to share the results of public health surveillance with public health authorities, with public health researchers, and with communities and individuals who have contributed to surveillance systems; (6) are there circumstances when data sharing must be strictly prohibited; and (7) what institutional mechanisms should be established to ensure ethical issues are systematically addressed before data collection, use, and dissemination?
4 Hepple B The guidelines are rooted in the tradition of public health ethics, the focus of which has been on articulating and assessing the moral issues that arise in the pursuit of population health. Concepts such as the common good, equity, solidarity, reciprocity, and population wellbeing are, as a result, central to these guidelines. This is not to say that autonomy, privacy, and individual rights and liberties are not also important ethical considerations. However, the social or public values that frame these guidelines illustrate the importance of community and the traditions of good governance. Some use the language of solidarity, drawing on the communitarian tradition in public health; others, the mutual obligations of reciprocity. The Nuffield Council on Bioethics, for instance, sought to define the duties and responsibilities of government with the concept of stewardship.
The new public health surveillance guidelines describe the affirmative duty to undertake surveillance but also note its limits. Countries have a duty to establish effective surveillance systems. When necessary, such efforts must be assisted by the global community, although such an obligation does not give high-income countries the freedom to ignore the priority-setting decisions of countries that require support. Surveillance can justifiably require that names or other individually identifying features be reported to public health registries to assure the accuracy and utility of surveillance systems. However, countries must also protect reported identifiable data from misuse or abuse. Surveillance serves to support policy making and advocacy, so governments have an obligation to publicise the results of surveillance activities and to act to ameliorate, to the extent feasible, the issues that are revealed by surveillance systems. Finally, it is crucial to create oversight mechanisms to assure that the ethical foundations of surveillance activities are reflected in policy and practice.
These guidelines will be applied to situations that might vary in fundamental ways, and they recognise that value trade-offs are sometimes inevitable. For instance, countries with different local traditions and priorities might strike a different balance between competing values and priorities. It is important to highlight, however, that not all trade-offs are morally acceptable. There may be local, national, or regional circumstances characterised by gross violations of human rights. For example, an occupational disease surveillance system that resulted in routine dismissal of workers affected by silicosis, black lung, or asbestosis would be unacceptable. Trade-offs under such circumstances could provide a pretext for further oppression and should be guarded against.
The WHO Guidelines for Ethics in Public Health Surveillance are offered as the basis for the development of ethical national surveillance systems. They represent a starting point for the sustained discussions that surveillance demands. But they are, most fundamentally, central to the justification of surveillance as a core activity that extends beyond outbreak contexts or infectious diseases.

My name is Jamrat Mason and I have a vagina. I'm involved in East London Community Activism but today I'm here to speak “as a trans person” about transgender issues. The term “transgender” is a broad term that refers to to a massive spectrum of people who in some way veer away from the gender written on their birth certificate. So, I cannot, in any way whatsoever, be representative of transgendered people. I can only talk about the world as I see it, from where I'm standing, as a transexual.
I'm a lucky tranny. First of all because I'm alive. And secondly because I have a family who loves me. That shouldn't be lucky, but at the moment, it is. My own experience is quite unique so I thought I'd give you a quick history: At 3 years old my first sentence was “I'm a boy”, at 7 years old when I was still convinced that this was true, my parents took me to a psychologist. The psychologist said I probably have “Gender Dysphoria”. My parents talked to my school and allowed me to cut my hair and wear a boy's uniform. When I was 8 I was referred on to a specialist in London (on the NHS) who I saw until I was 18. When I was 12 I legally changed my name which my granny paid for. So I've been living as male since I was about 7 or 8. I went through a full female puberty and eventually got testosterone when I was 21. I had surgery when I was 22. I'm 24 now so I've looked like this for about 2 years.
It's not my intention to simple ask for a complacent acceptance of trans people — for people to just stop insulting us and beating us up... I want to talk about transphobia as an issue that affects all of us — and that we can all play a part in fighting. We must, as a society, be better at gender.
In the womb we all start off as female. People who come out as little boys are changed during the pregnancy when testosterone is introduced. The clitoris grows and becomes penis, and the labia becomes a scrotum. Woman are so-called because they're meant to be like men, but with wombs — womb-man. But in reality, men are women with big clitorises. Bigclits. Most people come out with either a vagina or a penis, but some people are somewhere inbetween — these people are ‘intersex'. As soon as we're born boys and girls are treated drasticallly differently — boys are given lego, girls are given dolls (and then people wonder about the lack of female engineers); girls are encouraged to care and talk about their feelings, whilst boys are told to be tough. Every boy and girl, to some extent, has to grapple with the difference between who they are, and what a Real Man is. What a Real Woman is. Every body suffers from the invention of the Man and the Woman. And I consider myself an extreme casualty of this — I don't really consider myself a Man — but I know, violently, that I'm not a woman. I think that transpeople generally are an extreme casualty of this problem.
Society is organised into men and women and I don't fit into either. If I were to have to go to prison, I could either be a man in an all female prison, or a man with a vagina in an all male-prison where privacy is not exactly a priority. If I were to be arrested and strip-searched I've got a choice between a male officer or a female police officer. But I'm not a man, that is not my sex, I am a transexual. There is now a Gender Recognition Certificate so that I can be recognised as either a Man or a Woman by the state. But I am not a Man or a Woman, I am a transexual. I could be treated as a man, go to a male prison, be searched by a male officer, get married to a woman. But I don't want to get married, I don't want to live in a society where people are sent to prison and strip searched by police. I don't believe in leading a fight where we're asking the government to deal with us more efficiently, to oppress us better. I don't want to be integrated better a rotten system, I want something different altogether. I want to take part in creating a better world.
Prejudice against transmen, that's me, is based on the sense that we're trying to muscle in on the privilege of being male that we don't deserve, we are inadequate, we don't have penises, and if we do, they're either weird and tiny or crap. We're inadequate men, with big bums and crap willies.
Prejudice against transwomen is based on the sense that they're degrading themselves, they're funny, a joke, why would you want to be a woman? They're trying to take a step down in society.
So transphobia is rooted in sexism. Some people believe that transwomen can't possibly know what it's like to be a woman because they haven't experienced sexism. But the transphobia that transwoman get IS sexism, multiplied by a hundred!
Some people say that trans men are just trying to escape sexism by turning into men. Let me tell you, when you're a transexual, you do not escape sexism, you are pushed right into an enormous swamp of sexism. When you experience both sides and more, you begin to see the sexism, you notice it when other people don't, when you play with gender you're witnessing the flow of power.
Sexism, and more specifically this form of sexism which is a reaction to people's gender deviance — not being a Proper Man, or a Proper Woman, is something that seems to be ignored. It plays a huge part in homophobia — A gay boy, who is very masculine and handy with his fists is not likely to be bullied at school. School kids don't usually see what their schoolmates find sexually attractive, they see how they behave. Effeminate boys are bullied for being effeminate — and the words the kids use are gay, and batty boy, but they're being bullied because they're not acting like Real Men, this is sexism, but we call it homophobia. And when you call it homophobia, what organisations are there helping the effeminate straight boy? He's being told that it's okay to be gay, but no one's saying that it's okay to be a bit girly. This is the same bullying that transexual people experience in the extreme, but it is in no way reserved for us.
The experience of transgendered people is at the lethally sharp end of the wedge — and it is a lethally sharp edge, the Transgender Day of Remembrance website shows that in 2009 130 transgendered people were reported murdered- but this is a universal problem, rooted in sexism, it affects all os us and we can all take a part in fighting it.
The invention of the Real Man and the Real Woman is enshrined in the economy. For as long as someone has to work all week to get a wage, to survive, and for as long as we have babies that have to be looked after, someone else has to work in the home, and bring up babies for free. At the moment, most of the time, the man works full time and the woman works for free in the home. It's the unpaid labour that keeps the whole system running. Take it away, and the whole thing collapses. But that won't change by messing around with gender, or by swapping it around and turning the patriarchy into a matriarchy, or mixing it up, or by taking turns... or by paying another woman minimum wage to do the job instead. For as long as this system keeps going, someone has to work in the home for free. And this is one of the most fundamental injustices the forms the foundation of our economy. As much as transgendered people might highlight that these are not two unchanging natural roles, a liberal plea for tolerance is not the force that will bring it down.
I want to come back to this idea that we need to, as a society, as a community, be better at gender. The transition from one gender role to another is not just about surgery, in fact surgery plays a very small role in it. For the most part, transition is social, because gender roles are social. As I mentioned before, I lived for 12 years as male without any surgery or hormones whatsoever. I now fit into the category of male because people call me ‘he' and regard me as male. The fact that transition is social seems to be lost on most people, when someone comes out as trans, people tend to wait until that person is manly, or womanly, enough to convince them. The onus is put on the trans person to “act like a man” or “act like a woman” just to have their identity respected. This often means, that for transmen, we are rewarded for acting like macho idiots, for only then will people respect our identity. It should be everyone's responsibility to respect someone's identity, to play a part in the journey to becoming comfortable in their skin.
What is it we want with our Pride Marches and our activism?
The freedom to walk down the street, dressed how you like, kissing who you like, in a couple of expensive areas of central and west London? What about kissing in Clapton? Stratford? East Ham? What about being free in our working class communities where we actually live? When will we be free to express our love, our gender, our bodies without fear of being beaten up by gangs of teenage boys? And what about those teenage boys? Our neighbours? When will that teenage boy feel free to suck off his mate, or wear a dress, without fear of complete rejection or without thinking that that would make him an entirely different person?
It might be tempting, for those middle class homosexuals who have achieved their freedom, who are happily walking hand in hand down their little street in Hampstead, to pull the ladder up behind them and not be associated with transgenders, with us deviants, or with us working class queers in areas like Hackney, who still live surrounded by homophobia, transphobia, sexism. I think we can see that temptation when we look at what London Pride has become. And that's why it's important to have events like this, to keep our grassroots activism, and not accept anything less than absolute and complete freedom.
When discussing the merits of video games as an artform, gamers generally have two living examples ready to fire off—ICO and Shadow of the Colossus. And that's not without good reason; visuals, level designs, graphics, and storytelling that artistic are rarely seen outside of games made by the developer, Team ICO. With their next game still well over the horizon, Sony decided to give the fans what they've been clamoring for—a remastered release of the two classics on Playstation 3. Since I happen to be such a fervent fan of Shadow of the Colossus and have never played the team's first game, I decided to relinquish more of my money to SCEA like the filthy consumer sheep I am. Could ICO possibly meet my standards, set by its successor, or was it just a stepping stone to greater things?
As in Shadow of the Colossus, ICO's story is quite simple. A boy with horns is brought to a castle by unknown men and left to expire because of some superstitious hogwash. After his escape, he rescues a girl named Yorda from her captivity and the two spend the remainder of the game searching for castle's exit. A certain beauty exists in a story so simple, and the presentation is such that the player does not realize its scarcity until another cut scene progresses the plot. That leads me to another marvelous aspect about ICO—its lack of cut scenes. The brevity of the story means fewer cut scenes and thus, fewer breaks in the action, a trend that is disappointingly absent from the majority of modern games. Metal Gear Solid 4 is a perfect example of what happens when cut scenes go horribly wrong and transform what could have been a magnificent game into an interactive film. Luckily, Team ICO seems to care far more about making a game than a movie, so ICO is assuredly the former.
ICO's art style should be familiar to fans of Shadow of the Colossus, marked by scores of interesting stone architecture, glowing designs, and wildly varied landscapes. The unique style is absolutely beautiful and provides for an intensely visually interesting game. One distinct difference between ICO and its spiritual successor is that ICO uses far less bloom effect. As beautiful as Colossus was, I certainly could have stood for less amateur Photoshop effects, as the graphics and art speak more loudly than hazy lighting. The art style also does a wonderful job of directing the player through the same rooms repeatedly without boring them to death. A perfectly bad example of level reuse comes in the form of Legend of Zelda: Phantom Hourglass. In that game, the player had to go through the same central temple multiple times to advance. Doing so was incredibly painful, boring, and made me face the fact that I was wasting my time left on earth solving the same five puzzles ad infinitum. ICO, on the other hand, reuses rooms the correct way—by either using radically different space within the room, having wildly dissimilar puzzles, or making the room distractingly beautiful.
Combat in ICO is almost non-existent. You beat shadow monsters with sticks or swords quite easily, so I'm perplexed as to why they were added to the game at all. I'd wager that their true purpose was to make the player drag Yorda around, lest she be swallowed by the baddies and cause a game over. It is a rather cheap mechanism that adds a brand of superficial importance to Yorda.
If she actually meant a thing to the player, he would have dragged her around the level without the threat of failure. The combat mechanic should have been either improved or removed, as it serves no real purpose in the game other than to lengthen gameplay and artificially inflate Yorda's importance. It simply feels like an afterthought.
On a related note, the game only took seven hours to complete and I am torn between thinking that's an asset or a drawback. I usually prefer games to take longer as I tend to revel in and obsess over them for a time and then never play them again. However, I'm not sure ten more hours of climbing, puzzle solving, and woman pulling would have made the game any better.
ICO's most glaring flaw is the frustrating camera. Barely moving the camera stick whips the camera quickly in that direction, making pinpointing specific objects a chore. The constant slight movements of human fingers make trying to focus on something in the room a bit nauseating as the screen whips about with the slightest pressure difference. One could assume that this issue carried over for the entirety of the camera's range, but one would be sorely mistaken; the camera's movement slows down to a crawl at its borders. When approaching its boundaries, the camera's sluggishness makes looking farther than half the screen away nigh pointless, as it is more frustrating than helpful. If you have ever played a PC game with low mouse sensitivity, you can commiserate. I simply feel as if the developers could have taken some time to fix this obvious flaw. I'd rather be frustrated by my own ineptitude at solving a puzzle than failing to properly wrangle an unruly camera.
ICO is a beautiful game, just like its spiritual successor. It may be slightly rougher around the edges, but Team ICO's charm is certainly present. If you enjoyed the platforming and puzzles of Uncharted and the art style of Shadow of the Colossus, you'll love ICO. Though the camera may be a bit of a pain and the enemies are little more than an annoyance, you will find seven or so hours of wonderful fun in high definition.
Ramirez, 27, began this season with the Giants, posting an 8.71 ERA in nine games before San Francisco designated him for assignment. He subsequently joined the Blue Jays, who designated him for assignment on Sunday before he could play in a game.

Ramirez, 27, began this season with the Giants, posting an 8.71 ERA in nine games before San Francisco designated him for assignment. He subsequently joined the Blue Jays, who designated him for assignment on Sunday before he could play in a game. Ramirez elected free agency instead of a job in Triple-A, allowing the Mets to sign him.
"It's definitely been a crazy couple weeks," said Ramirez, who has been throwing regular bullpen sessions but last appeared in a game April 29.
Since the start of last season, six organizations have employed Ramirez, a former Cubs supplemental-round Draft pick and native of Virginia, where he played as a child with David Wright. Ramirez has not pitched a full season since his rookie year in 2014, when he went 3-3 with a 1.44 ERA in 43 2/3 innings. The right-hander owns a 3.72 ERA with 110 strikeouts in 92 innings during his four-year big league career.
"I know I can get guys out," Ramirez said. "I think I've proven that by being able to get those strikeouts. It's just being more consistent."
Statistics aside, the Mets simply need someone who can give a scuffling bullpen some much-needed innings. Entering Tuesday, Mets starters have gone 15 straight games without recording an out in the seventh inning, forcing their relievers to throw an average of 3.8 innings per game over that stretch. Their 57 1/3 innings in that span rank as the second most in the National League, while their .305 opponents' batting average and 7.38 ERA are both worst.
"We certainly are in need of a guy who can come out of the bullpen," Mets manager Terry Collins said. "He's had some experience down there. Hopefully, he gets some outs for us."
Aside from Josh Smoker, whom the Mets optioned to Triple-A Las Vegas last week, New York has no relievers thriving at Las Vegas, forcing the club to look outside the organization for help.
"Every team kind of goes through struggles throughout the year," Ramirez said, adding that he is "mind-blown" by the Mets' raw talent. "I don't think it's anything new. I'm just ready to get here and help these guys win."
Rotation edit
With Robert Gsellman struggling and the Mets' bullpen starved for fresh arms, the club has decided to skip Gsellman's next start and use him temporarily as a reliever. Due to a team off-day Thursday, no other starter will have to pitch on short rest. Gsellman owns a 9.00 ERA over his last four outings, with seven strikeouts and seven walks in 18 innings.

The cost of insurance claims for lightning strikes nearly doubled between 2004 and 2011, even as the actual number of claims shrank dramatically, and an industry trade group says fancy new TVs and videogame consoles are to blame.
The Insurance Information Institute, in a study released on Thursday, found insured losses related to lightning strikes reached nearly $1-billion in 2011. That was actually down from a year earlier, and the number of total claims also fell.
The institute, which acts as a communications and research arm for the industry, said the increased use of lightning protection equipment in homes was responsible for the decline in claims. In fact, from 2004 to 2011, the number of paid claims fell 33 per cent.
Story continues below advertisement
Yet even with the sharp decline in total claims, the average cost per claim rose 93 per cent to $5,112 over that period.
One of the biggest culprits, the III said, was the increased home use of electronics like flat-screen TVs, computers and videogame consoles, all of which are susceptible to power surges related to lightning strikes.
According to the Consumer Electronics Association, from 2007 to 2011 shipments of consumer electronics (like TVs and consoles) rose 15 per cent, supporting the notion that more homes have more surge-prone items than in the past.
Replacement costs are also on the rise, according to the III study, in part because last year's earthquake in Japan and floods in Thailand disrupted many companies' supply chains, leading to shortages and price increases.
The National Lightning Detection Network recorded nearly 23.4-million lightning flashes nationwide in 2011.

Several law enforcement organizations are offering a cash reward totaling $3,000 for information leading to the arrest and conviction of the suspect in the Tuthill Park shooting.
The rewards are being offered as an additional way to move the investigation forward, Detective Rob Forster of the Sioux Falls Police Department.
"This is something that's done around the country in other instances," Forster said. "This is the first time we've had a situation like this happen in the Sioux Falls community."
Officer Anthony Davis was patrolling the park Jan. 1 when he was approached by a man who appeared to be holding a gun. After several commands to drop the weapon, Davis fired eight rounds toward the man. Police searched the park, but the suspect was not found.
Sgt. Mike Walsh, president of the South Dakota Fraternal Order of Police, said his organization exists to support its members.
"It's important to stress this is the first time an assault on an officer has gone this long without an arrest," Walsh said. "I wouldn't characterize it as leads drying up; I would characterize it as let's gather as much information as we can."
Stu Whitney blog: Reward seeks to unlock Tuthill Park mystery
Walsh, who works for the Minnehaha County Sheriff's Office, referred to the shooting as a "rapid, instantaneous confrontation."
"Make no mistake, this was a serious incident. It is a serious problem when you have someone willing to confront a police officer like that."
Walsh said safety, honesty and public duty commonly motivate people to bring tips forward.
"In this line of work, sometimes motivators need to be found to help people come in with tips," he said. "Very often, a strong motivation is money. In this case, it's just an additional step we want to take."
Detectives are certain the suspect has told others of his involvement in the crime, Walsh said.
"Speaking from an investigative standpoint, very few people keep things to themselves," he said. "I believe the subject involved in this has told more than one person they were involved."
Walsh said cases like these don't go unsolved.
"We do eventually solve nearly every case we come in contact with."
When investigating a situation such as this, Walsh said it's important for detectives to understand the mindset of the suspect.
"It is imperative that we understand the reasons why these things happen," he said. "If it happened for another reason other than the desire to kill Anthony Davis, we need to know. Right now, we have to assume somewhere in the spectrum of misunderstanding to homicidal intention."
Police will work with a credible source to conceal his or her identity if the person wants to remain anonymous, Walsh said.
"We need information that will lead to an arrest and a conviction," Walsh said. "It depends on the circumstances, but I don't want to mislead anyone, there is a chance their identity will have to be revealed."
The Sioux Falls Fraternal Order of Police Labor Council is offering $1,000 for the reward while the South Dakota Fraternal Order of Police is offering $1,000. The Minnehaha County Deputies Association is offering $500, and the Fraternal Order of Police Lodge No. 1 Sioux Falls is offering $500.
Anyone with tips regarding the crime is encouraged to contact Detective Michael Webb at 367-7234.

Aston Villa starlet Jack Grealish has been offered free flights for life - should he opt to play for the Republic of Ireland.
The 19-year-old has represented the Republic's Under-21 side but has declined one senior call-up, as he also qualifies to play for England.
Grealish is said to be holding out for Three Lions recognition but Ryanair bosses hope they can sway his decision.
According to the Sun, the airline's boss Michael O'Leary plans to offer the Villa winger - and his family - free flights if he chooses the Republic.
The offer was made to Grealish's father Kevin during Villa's 3-0 defeat to Chelsea on Saturday , who will now discuss it with his son.
Grealish - who has been compared to Gareth Bale at a similar age - was an unused substitute at Stamford Bridge but has impressed club boss Paul Lambert this season.
After two weeks of intense emotion, Bones Season 10 Episode 3 opens in a pretty classic way - with two random civilians, in this case, teenage girls, happening upon a dead body.
I usually find this to be a bit trite, but for this episode, I found it to be a welcome relief. It gives us a break from the high emotions of the past two episodes.
Something that I had trouble with in Bones Season 10 Episode 2 was the lack of interaction between Booth and Brennan, especially in discussing everything that has happened to them -- Booth's imprisonment, the conspiracy, and the death of Sweets.
So I was glad to see that right at the beginning of the episode, Brennan shows concern for Booth. She tells him she's worried that he hasn't been sleeping, and that he hasn't been dealing with the trauma in a healthy way. I'm so glad this is addressed, because I felt it was glossed over in the last episode.
I'll sleep when I'm tired. But for now, I'm gonna make you pancakes. Booth Permalink: I'll sleep when I'm tired. But for now, I'm gonna make you pancakes.

Last week, our Bones Round Table Participants discussed which squintern they hoped to see next. While no one mentioned Rodolfo Fuentes, I thought he was a lot of fun to watch in this episode. He's a sort of smooth, suave guy that makes everyone smile. He loves to flirt with the ladies, and at least one of those ladies doesn't mind it one bit.
Angela: What? He's eye candy. Just deal with it.
Hodgins: You here just to gawk, or did you finish your reconstruction? Permalink: You here just to gawk, or did you finish your reconstruction?
Permalink: You here just to gawk, or did you finish your reconstruction?
I was also really happy to see more of Angela and Hodgins this week. These are fun characters that mean a lot to the story, and I've missed seeing their interactions. Hodgins rolls his eyes when Angela flirts with Rodolfo, but he isn't actually jealous. He just makes a joke out of it.
And Angela and Hodgins both helped solve the case this week: Angela with her growing technology and computer skills, and Hodgins with his love for inspecting rodents and goop. These are the kinds of scenes we need more often.
The case, by the way, was a really interesting choice to follow the past two episodes. The victim is a controversial talk radio host who happens to be into S&M, which caused some the injuries that confused the team until the put all of the puzzle pieces together.
This was a good choice not only because it led to some humorous moments, but also because it very quickly changed the mood from the beginning of the season -- in a way that a traditional sort of case might not have been able to do. It also gave Booth and Brennan plenty to talk about.
Some of my favorite scenes in this series are when Booth and Brennan are driving. Their chats about cases reveal a lot about their characters, their relationship, and their differing views on the world. This week's conversation about S&M is just one example.
Bones: Sex and violence are two of humanity's most primal urges. An amalgamation of them is a logical bi-product.
Booth: Bones, S&M isn't a peanut butter cup. It isn't two great tastes that go together. Permalink: Bones, S&M isn't a peanut butter cup. It isn't two great tastes that go together.
Permalink: Bones, S&M isn't a peanut butter cup. It isn't two great tastes that go together.
And Brennan's reaction to the sex dungeon? Priceless. I wish this scene would have been longer.
Then there's Aubrey. Even if you don't like this guy, you probably aren't going to have a choice. He's confident and quirky, and he has a sort of fast-paced speech that makes him a unique character (no matter how badly we want to compare him to Sweets). It was fun to see his reaction to the mutilated body at the beginning of this episode, too. It actually reminded me of how repulsed Booth used to be by these sorts of things. But now, Booth joins Cam in ranking the body in its grossness.
Aubrey also starts to show a little emotion in this episode as he tries to convince Booth to trust him. Booth shuts him out of the investigation as much as possible in this episode, claiming that he doesn't need his help.
Look, I know that what happened to you is messed up. And then what happened to Sweets. But remember that Sweets trusted me to work with you, So when you treat me like crap, you're treating Sweets like crap too. Aubrey Permalink: Look, I know that what happened to you is messed up. And then what happened to Sweets. But...
Permalink: Look, I know that what happened to you is messed up. And then what happened to Sweets. But...
It makes sense that Booth would have trouble trusting him, but even Brennan tries to convince Booth that Aubrey is good. She does something that she might not have done years ago, and has Aubrey take her place in the interrogation room. Of course, she makes sure he knows how to pronounce some words correctly beforehand. This is Brennan's way of getting Booth to trust Aubrey, and it seems like it may just work.
Aubrey shows a bit of a vulnerable side at the end of the episode. Booth and Brennan are back at home, making drinks and even laughing a little. Aubrey shows up with a bottle of wine, and thanks them for allowing him into their group. Of course this moment reminded me of Sweets. I think there was even a similar scene when Sweets first joined the show.
Aubrey doesn't stick around, though. Booth actually invites him to stick around for a drink, but Aubrey says he can "get obnoxious" when he drinks, and he doesn't want to mess up a good thing. Aubrey is trying, and I can see him forming a good friendship with Booth.
Overall, I thought this was a pretty good episode. We're still only scratching the surface at Booth's trauma, but it is being addressed. And I think we needed an episode with a fun/weird case and some light-hearted jokes like this. Personally, I don't know if I can handle much more emotion on this show for a while!
So what did you think of this episode, Bones fans? Leave a comment -- we want to hear your thoughts!
And if you can't wait for next week's episode, you can always catch up with Booth and Brennan when you watch Bones online via TV Fanatic.

It has been, all things considered, a damn fine year at the movies. There were scintillating blockbusters, like the superhero extravaganza Captain America: Civil War and the surprisingly effective Rogue One: A Star Wars Story; a throwback song-and-dance musical with enough pizzazz to warm the coldest of hearts; and a heartbreaking love story for the ages.
And by God, Americans needed these sporadic departures from reality—what with a pussy-grabbing Twitter troll tearing at the very fabric of our democracy.
With approximately 900 feature-length films released in 2016, or around 17 per week, many gems were bound to be left by the wayside. Due to the onslaught of films, The New York Times was forced to change its review policy last year, no longer guaranteeing coverage for all theatrical releases.
Our annual list of the Most Overlooked Movies of 2015 included the psych-pop Brian Wilson biopic Love & Mercy, the Holocaust saga Phoenix, and the gripping coming-of-age story Diary of a Teenage Girl, among others.
Here are this year's picks for the best movies you probably missed.
10. TRAIN TO BUSAN
Director Yeon Sang-ho's South Korean slaughterfest, about a group of passengers trapped aboard a train during a zombie outbreak, is the cinematic lovechild of Snowpiercer and Dawn of the Dead, providing a heady and exhilarating mix of class warfare, parental neglect, and murderous mayhem. There is the disaffected banker who's promised his young daughter to take her to visit her mother in Busan; the salt of the earth blue-collar fella and his very pregnant wife; a venal CEO; two old sisters; a homeless man; and an entire freaking baseball team. As the infection spreads from one passenger to another, forcing each and every person onboard to do everything in their power to survive, their true natures are revealed.
9. A BIGGER SPLASH
Come for the breathtaking setting, the Italian island of Pantelleria in the Strait of Sicily, and stay for Tilda Swinton and Ralph Fiennes's dramatic pas de deux—she is the mute David Bowie-esque glam rocker on vocal rest, and he her corybantic ex-manager who will not shut the fuck up to save his life. Their fire-and-ice chemistry is a marvel to behold, with special kudos going to Fiennes, who delivers the most gleefully feral performance of his career (and quite literally bares all). Italian filmmaker Luca Guadagnino (I Am Love) crams a lot into his film, from a Freudian subplot involving Fiennes's daughter Penelope, played by Dakota Johnson, to a passing comment on the plight of refugees, but even when the party takes an unexpected turn during the final third, it never loosens its grip.
8. PATHS OF THE SOUL
Chinese filmmaker Zhang Yang (Shower) blurs the line between documentary and narrative fiction in his latest, which follows a group of Tibetans as they embark on the 1,200-mile bowing pilgrimage to Lhasa, the holy capital of Tibet whose name translates to “Place of the Gods.” Yang tracked the villagers for a year, and while the journey is trying, the rewards are vast—from stunning Tibetan vistas to the personal stories of the pilgrims, each hoping to cleanse certain stains from their soul. No other film released this year will make one ponder life's bigger questions quite like Paths of the Soul.
7. THE INVITATION
An unlikely comeback vehicle for Karyn Kusama, the talented Girlfight filmmaker who's been chewed up and spit out by Hollywood (see: Aeon Flux), this deliciously sinister offering is equal parts L.A. satire, study of coping with grief, and edge-of-your-seat suspenser. Its premise is simple enough: Will (Logan Marshall-Green) and his new girlfriend Kira (Emayatzy Corinealdi) are invited to dinner with their group of friends at the posh home of his ex-wife Eden (Tammy Blanchard) and her new husband David (Michiel Huisman). No one in this close-knit circle of friends has seen Eden and David in two years, and as the night wears on and the wine begins to flow, Will becomes convinced that their hosts want more than mere company.
6. LITTLE MEN
No filmmaker right now is better than Ira Sachs at dramatizing the deleterious effects of urban gentrification, and here, as he did in his sublime gay romance Love Is Strange, he presents a stirring portrait of New York City's real-estate nightmare. When Brian (Greg Kinnear) inherits a two-story Brooklyn brownstone from his dead father, his family moves in—only to find a dress shop run by Leonor Calvelli (Paulina Garcia) in the ground-floor space. Like Brian, Leonor has a 13-year-old son, and the two boys become fast friends. But when Brian and his wife learn that his late father had been charging Leonor exceptionally low rent on her store, he finds himself at the crossroads of self-interest and compassion.
5. UNDER THE SHADOW
With all due respect to The Witch, Iranian-born filmmaker Babak Anvari's directorial debut is not only the best horror film of the year, but also a deeply complex study of how the ghosts of Iran's past continue to haunt its present. Set in 1988 Tehran, in the middle of the Iran-Iraq War, Shideh (Narges Rashidi) and her young daughter Dorsa (Avin Manshadi) elect to stay in their building amidst the shelling. They both begin experiencing visions as Shideh suspects that a djinn, or evil spirit, has designs on her daughter. Heavy on subtext—and genuine scares—Anvari's film is not to be missed.
4. THE HANDMAIDEN
South Korean filmmaker Park Chan-wook is prone to stylistic excess. It often works well, as in the poetic brutality of Oldboy, but can also lead to literal and figurative overkill (see: the last half of Stoker). But here, he's found the perfect story for his visual flourishes: a trashy, twisty erotic thriller. Set during Japanese colonial rule in Korea, a con man hires a Japanese pickpocket to pose as the maid of a Japanese heiress—in order to swindle her out of her fortune. But maid and master soon fall in love, setting off a series of erotically charged events. Park's film is undeniably his—bold, sensuous, and thoroughly engrossing. It's also the sexiest movie of the year.
3. THE FITS
Filmmaker Anna Rose Holmer's stellar debut, a product of the Venice Biennale, tells the tale of Toni (Royalty Hightower, brilliant), an 11-year-old inner-city kid who finds herself torn between her love of boxing and her latest fixation: a dance/drill team. When members of the dance troupe start coming down with violent “fits,” we're left wondering whether the children are being poisoned, or if something more otherworldly is at hand. As I wrote in August, “Holmer's film is visually sumptuous, ethereal even, and a haunting meditation on identity, puberty, and assimilation.” And newcomer Royalty Hightower delivers perhaps the most mesmerizing child performance since Quvenzhané Wallis's in Beasts of the Southern Wild.
2. GREEN ROOM
The plot of Green Room, Jeremy Saulnier's follow-up to his stellar debut Blue Ruin, is straightforward enough: A punk rock band of twentysomethings squares off against a gang of neo-Nazis inside an abandoned bunker in the backwoods of Oregon. The beauty lies in the execution, as Saulnier stages this war of attrition with heart-pounding—and occasionally brutal—precision. And, amid the severed limbs and flesh-eating dogs, there is the leader of the skinheads, played with menacing calm by Sir Patrick Stewart, and our hero, embodied by the late Anton Yelchin. Given his recent passing, the film has taken on an added layer of emotion as you root for this frail, terribly outmatched punk rock kid to defy the odds.
1. AMERICAN HONEY
Andrea Arnold's (Fish Tank) latest tracks a gang of outcasts as they traverse the American Midwest, selling magazine subscriptions and getting down to trap music. Beautiful lensing and powerful performances aside, no film captures millennials' mélange of entrepreneurial spirit and rebellion quite like this one.
HONORABLE MENTION(S):
The documentaries TOWER and NEWTOWN shine a necessary light on the epidemic of gun violence in America, while MORRIS FROM AMERICA provides a moving fish-out-of-water story about a black American teen growing up in Germany. EMBRACE OF THE SERPENT is a surreal, stunning exploration of an Amazonian myth, and the French drama THINGS TO COME proves once again that Isabelle Huppert is an actress of the highest order, and that Mia Hansen-Løve is one of the best young filmmakers around.
A Wisconsin criminal-defense attorney says the state's approach to juvenile justice needs change. (lilly3/iStockPhoto)
SHEBOYGAN, Wis. - The Netflix documentary series "Making a Murderer" drew national attention to the 2005 murder of Teresa Halbach. Steven Avery was convicted of the murder, and Avery's nephew, Brendan Dassey, who was 16 at the time, was tried and convicted in adult court of helping Avery commit the crime. But now, a federal judge has thrown out Dassey's so-called confession, and opened the possibility that Dassey will be set free.
Sheboygan criminal defense attorney Casey Hoff said Dassey should not have been tried in adult court.
"The problem with that is that we have so much medical and scientific research that shows that juveniles simply do not have the brain development that adults have," he said. "In males, it can be in the mid-20s when they have a fully formed brain, depending on the scientific research that you look at."
Hoff and others think juveniles should not be tried in adult court. Supporters of trying juveniles as adults have said that if a young person commits a heinous crime, they're acting as an adult and should be treated that way.
According to Hoff, wrongful juvenile convictions because of forced confessions happen more often than most people think.
"We know it because we have people that have confessed to crimes - so-called confessions - that later were exonerated by DNA evidence," he said. "So this isn't something that just happens extremely rarely. Unfortunately, it happens far too often than we might like to admit."
In Dassey's case, the federal judge ruled that the so-called confession was coaxed out of the special-education student by police who coerced him.
Hoff referenced another current high-profile Wisconsin case involving two young girls from Waukesha, accused of stabbing their young friend multiple times to please a fictional character.
"You've seen this in the Slender Man decision where you had, I believe, it was the 12-year-old girls that are now being tried as adults," he said. "They simply do not have the same cognitive and decision-making and appreciation of risks and consequences as adults do. It doesn't mean that we shouldn't hold juveniles accountable when they commit horrendous crimes."
Hoff agreed with the girls' attorney, who said that in the adult justice system, the young girls will not get the counseling and social services help that they need.

How I Learned Differentiation
by Jessica Hocket
As middle and high school student, I had few choices in learning and few opportunities for work I would have called “fun” or even worthwhile.
As a teacher, I pledged to make better use of adolescents' time and let them choose from meaningful tasks whenever possible. Looking back through old computer files of things I actually did, I see that I was somewhat “successful” in designing activities that were more engaging than what I had experienced myself. But many of these efforts—which I thought of as “differentiated”—also fell far short of what Carol Ann Tomlinson calls “respectful” differentiation. One instance from my second year of teaching stands out in particular.
I was scouring the Internet for activities related to an upcoming novel when I found a ready-made learning menu of tasks related to that very book. It used grades as motivational organizer for differentiation. Students could “choose” their own grade by doing a certain number of activities. If they wanted a C, they would do one list of tasks. If they wanted a B, they had to do the C tasks, plus the B tasks, and so on.
Within each group of activities, there were also some choices and a range of product options. I gave them several weeks to complete the tasks, allowing them to work on it in-class periodically. At the time, this approach seemed to satisfy my goals for giving students autonomy and chances to be creative.
My students seemed to appreciate the ownership that the menu gave, and for the most part completed the work on time and according to the directions. I didn't use it again (mostly because I thought it created too much work for me to grade!). Time, experience, and the work and wisdom of others helped me see the real problems in my approach to differentiation. In hindsight, there are three guidelines that I would give to my novice self.
“Different” isn't the same as “differentiated.”
The menu I adapted and used offered students an array of tasks loosely bound together by their connection to the same story. If my goal was for students to simply read the book and do some activities around it, then I achieved it. But my learning goals should have been more focused, specific, and measureable. Without common goals, tasks like those I offered are simply different from one another, but not truly differentiated. Some of the options were related to character motive, others to settings, others to themes, and others to making comparisons with other literature.
Still others weren't connected to any discernible goals—they were just fun. I didn't have all students working toward the same goals via varied routes; I had different routes to destinations that were miles apart. I later realized that I didn't need to offer a laundry list of choices. A few (or even two) carefully designed, authentic tasks tightly aligned to the same learning goals are what it takes to differentiate well.
Qualitative differentiation is more effective than quantitative differentiation.
I now know that my “Do these if you want this grade…” set-up represented a “quantitative” approach to differentiation. I figured that the higher-readiness (and/or more motivated) students would “self-differentiate” by doing more and better work. I also hoped that the connection to grades would spur some students to do more and better work than they usually did. My predictions came true, but only for some students. In practice, students who were not motivated by grades or the prospect of simply doing more did the bare minimum. I neglected to focus on the quality of the work in favor of the quantity of it and (worse) valued whether students had completed a task rather than what they had learned.
Differentiation means sometimes students choose and sometimes the teacher chooses.
In my zeal to incorporate choice, I came to equate choice with differentiation. I believed that anytime I offered students choices, I was practicing differentiation and, conversely, that I couldn't truly differentiate without giving students a choice. The quality or nature of the choices mattered less to me than not telling students what they had to do or that there was only one way to do something. This was certainly the case with my menu.
I later came to understand that differentiation does not require student choice in all things. When I differentiated tasks for student interest and student learning preferences, I was most likely looking to motivate students and make learning more efficient. So, students choosing made sense. But when I differentiated tasks for student readiness—in effect creating parallel tasks based on evidence of differences in students academic skills—then it would've made sense to strongly guide the choice or assign tasks to students to ensure a proper “match.”
The bottom line: Students can have choices about how to grow, but should not have the choice of whether to grow.
In retrospect, this example of my early attempts to differentiate by giving students interesting choices wasn't a botched experiment but an invaluable starting point. I know more about differentiation now than I did then and less than I will tomorrow.

Slash a few dollars off your next grocery store bill by using some of these simple tips and tricks.
1. Shop With a List
Studies have shown that you save more money when you shop with a list because it helps you stick to only buying the items you need. If you go to the grocery store without a plan you're more likely to fall prey to impulse purchases.
2. Beware of the Cart
Shopping cart sizes have been increasing for years. The reason for this is that grocery stores know that larger shopping carts lead to more purchases. Shoppers subconsciously have a desire to fill up an empty cart so a larger cart leads to more purchases. If you're only picking up a few items try grabbing a hand basket instead of a cart.
3. Don't Shop Hungry
Make sure you have a meal or a snack before you head to the grocery store. A rumbling stomach can lead to unnecessary purchases.
4. Shop Seasonally
Produce is cheapest when it is purchased in season. A larger supply helps drive down the price. You can find a chart of what food are in season when here.
5. Wear Headphones
Grocery stores often play slowly paced music and it's not by accident. Playing slower music causes you to slow down your walking speed which leads to you spending more time in the store which leads to you buying more!
6. Bring Coupons
Coupons are a great way to save a ton of money while shopping for groceries. Combine coupons with what's on sale for some serious savings. You can even print out coupons before your shopping trips.
7. Avoid Prepared and Convenience Foods
Anything that you buy at a grocery store that saves you a couple minutes of work at home will be more expensive. This includes already prepared meals, pre-washed lettuce, pre-cut vegetables, grated cheese and pre-cut fruits. Buy the whole, raw versions and do the cutting yourself to save more at the register.
8. Shop the Outer Aisles
Staples like bread, milk, eggs, and meat tend to be placed around the outer aisles of the grocery store. This placement strategy forces you to walk the full distance of the grocery store exposing you to far more temptation. Don't give in by going up and down every isle, stick to your list!
9. Stock Up When Staples Are On Sale
If you see an item you purchase often on sale, stock up. This will save you money and a few extra trips to the store.
10. Shop the Top and Bottom Shelves
Grocery stores know that items placed at eye level are more likely to be purchased which is why they place the more expensive products there. Make sure you check the top and bottom shelves to save the most money.
11. Bring Cash
If you're trying to stick to a budget, try leaving the credit cards at home and only bring as much cash as you have budgeted for that shopping trip. This will force you to stick to your plan and not over spend.

Some Canadian researchers from the University of Victoria got pretty pragmatic about the world's ability to fuck up on climate change and published a comprehensive model of what will happen if (or when) we burn every drop of oil on the planet. With somewhere between 6.4 and 9.5 degrees of warming by 2300—safe levels being under two degrees—it's the bleakest long-term prediction the world has seen so far.
"The regional impacts would be even higher," lead author Kasia Tokarska told VICE. "The Arctic could warm even between 14.7 and 19.5 degrees, because the highest impacts of warming are in the northern high latitudes." As one National Geographic author noted, that kind of temperature shift could place palm trees and crocodiles in Alaska.
"The changes in precipitation are quite extreme as well," said Tokarska. "There could be increases even up to four times in some areas, and decreases up to three times in other regions." Needless to say, this all has "profound" consequences for human health, agriculture, economies, and pretty much everything else happening on planet Earth.
Previous studies by the UN-sanctioned Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change have modeled how much warming we would see if two trillion metric tons of carbon are emitted into the atmosphere. Those results have already been deemed outside safe levels. This latest study published in Nature Climate Change went further down the road to apocalypse, and looked at five trillion tons of emissions—the low estimate for all global fossil fuel reserves.
Tokarska said some past studies using simpler models have suggested warming may "slow down" in the high register of carbon accumulation. That's not going to happen, according to her research.
"Our study shows that this is not the case, and that the warming continues as the cumulative carbon emissions increase," Tokarska said. This is in part due to the way oceans slowly absorb heat. "The relationship between warming and total amount of carbon emitted continues to be linear, which has not been shown before."
Tokarska says the study is based on a "business as usual" model, where world nations take very little or no action to reduce emissions, and no more fuel reserves are discovered.
While the study paints a pretty pessimistic picture, Tokarska said there's still an outside chance humanity could prove itself even more damaging to the planet. "We used five trillion tons of carbon, which is actually the lower bound of the fossil fuel resource estimate," she said. "This number could be even higher, so if we keep burning fossil fuels it could be even worse.
The line about therapeutic medication to produce a fit, healthy equine athlete and a drugged-up superstar, capable of pedalling or galloping forever is being argued. "Horse racing is an industry in transition," wrote Dr Scott Palmer, an internationally known equine surgeon and practitioner, following the Breeders' Cup forum entitled ''Racing medication and its 'shades of gray.'" Palmer has served on the Task Force on Racehorse Health and Safety and is a former president of the American Association of Equine Practitioners. "It is a sport with a rich tradition but is competing for relevance in today's culture. Scrutiny from the public is greater and horse racing is struggling to redefine itself. "A number of controversial issues - particularly medication and injuries - were spotlighted [last year] in the national media and before Congress. Racehorse medication is the flashpoint … "
No doubt the US fuel, of a super nature but barred in Australia, is permitted. However, drug (or medication) law is getting tougher there. Sure, dirt racing takes more a toll on thoroughbreds than turf and Slack has been cut for US trainers. However, Rick Dutrow jnr recently had what could be his final appeal turned down regarding being outed for 10 years after syringes containing a painkiller and a sedative were found in his desk. The painkiller butorphanol - an opioid analgesic - was found in a urine sample of his charge Fastus Cactus in 2010 after he won at Aqueduct. Dutrow was also fined $50,000. By Palmer's reckoning, veterinarians are at the centre of the medication controversy. "How much medication is too much medication?'' he asked. "This is an ill-conceived question that oversimplifies the medication discussion … there is no correct or incorrect number to indicate how much is too much. "Appropriate use of any medication should be based on the findings of a thorough diagnostic examination in the context of a valid client-veterinarian-patient relationship. Veterinarians are professionals but in any profession we don't always do the right thing … "
Sydney has been fortunate to have outstanding vets, headed by Percy Sykes, who has put a lifetime into the turf with knowledge and science. Yet there was a strong move last year to license veterinarians under the web of the rules of racing. "Most veterinarians who work at the racetrack love horses," Palmer said. "Some might even say that they feel a stronger affinity for the horses themselves than they do for the people … Is money part of the problem? Absolutely … You can't understand the medication issue in racing without appreciating the dynamics of the owner-trainer-veterinarian relationship." What is it they say about owners: treat them like mushrooms, keep them in the dark and covered by horse manure? "The horse owner needs to set the tone for this relationship," Palmer said, taking a different view. ''The owner is the CEO of this operation. At the start, owners must decide how much involvement they want to have in this business relationship. "Do they want to set a budget, do they want to be involved in the selection of the veterinarian who treats their horses. Do they want to be involved with treatment decisions and therapy options? Are they in their comfort zone in this role?"
I just can't imagine Tommy Smith being told by an owner what vet he wanted. In fact, they couldn't even suggest a jockey. "Remember who is the top of all of the owner-trainer-veterinary schematics," Palmer said ''The single most important thing an owner can do to reduce the cost of veterinary services is to hold a face-to-face meeting with his trainer and veterinarian and clearly define his expectations for professional services for his horses." Palmer acknowledged dermorphin. "The dermorphin issue caught the industry off-guard in terms of scope of the problem and gaps in the regulatory infrastructure to prosecute the cases and regulate behaviour of veterinarians. " He maintains ''due consideration be given to the obvious distinctions between therapeutic overages, repeated violations and use of prohibited medications". Loading
Meanwhile, in Oklahoma a quarter-horse trainer, Roberto Sanchez-Munoz, has been banned for 100 years, 80 of them suspended, in the latest penalty handed down on frog juice. The Oklahoma Racing Commission also fined him $100,000 after 10 different positives came up for the class-one drug in his horses at Remington Park. Since the key to detecting the drug was developed last year, positives have cropped up in "lower-grade'' and quarter horses in Louisiana, Nebraska and New Mexico as well.
Don't believe the naysayers. Ontario is doing quite well under Kathleen Wynne.
Most readers won't be shocked to hear that the Ontario Liberal Party trails in most public opinion polls.
This is true. But why?
I would argue that it's due, at least in part, to the fact that negativity sells.
Some firebrand columnists would have us believe that Queen's Park is driving away jobs and impoverishing scores of working families. They would argue that Ontario Liberal policies are leading to something akin to the onset of a second Bolshevik revolution.
This hypothesis, however, doesn't stand up to any objective analysis of facts.
Here are some worth pondering.
For the past three years, Ontario led all G7 nations in economic growth. This growth has led to increased government revenue that has given the Liberals enough flexibility to invest in programs like free tuition, pharmacare and energy price relief.
The economic growth has also translated into 760,000 new jobs since the last recession, and almost 366,000 jobs since Wynne became premier. This has driven the provincial unemployment rate down to 5.7% and has kept it below the national average for two and a half years. Ontario's unemployment rate today is lower than it was under the supposedly business friendly governments of Mike Harris and Ernie Eves.
Some of this positive economic news can be attributed to global economic trends and federal policy decisions. Much of it, however, flows directly from specific policy decisions of the Wynne government.
For example, back in 2013, Premier Wynne, Finance Minister Charles Sousa and then Minister of Economic Development, Trade and Employment Eric Hoskins moved to create Ontario's first-ever Jobs and Prosperity Fund to help secure private sector investments by allowing the government to partner with businesses to bring jobs to Ontario. Since its creation, this fund has doled out over $620 million to 25 private sector projects, leveraging $7.1 billion worth of new investments and creating 35,000 jobs.
These are real jobs for real people.
In Guelph, for example, auto parts maker Linamar was awarded a grant of $50.25 million in 2015 to support an investment commitment of $506.8 million. This enables the company to develop and produce components for the next generation of fuel-efficient cars and capture a growing share of the North American automotive market. The project will create 1,200 jobs over the next 10 years.
Furthermore, we know that infrastructure spending also adds fuel to economic growth. Apart from creating jobs, it increases the economic productivity. Under Premier Wynne, Ontario will see $190 billion in infrastructure investments that is supporting the creation of 125,000 jobs each year.
None of this means that all is hunky dory. Ontario remains the most indebted sub sovereign jurisdiction in the world. Economic growth remains uneven both regionally and amongst different socioeconomic groups. Sky high electricity rates, especially in northern Ontario, continue to hamper growth and cost jobs.
There is more to do to ensure that all Ontarians are able to benefit from a red hot economy.
But we cannot ignore the successes of recent years. We cannot take the doom and gloom of the naysayers at face value. Facts, do indeed, matter.
Omar Khan served as Chief of Staff to several Ontario Liberal cabinet ministers, including the Minister of Economic Development, Trade and Employment. He is currently a Vice President for Public Affairs at Hill+Knowlton Strategies in Toronto and serves on the Ontario Liberal Party campaign steering committee.
In a war-torn country, men risk their lives in pursuit of a delicacy.
KIRKUK, Iraq–
In the springtime, the arid lands of northern Iraq undergo a dramatic transformation. Winter rains have made the undulating landscape a verdant green. Between sandstone outcrops, farmers till unfenced fields of wheat and barley, and hillsides blossom with wildflowers. Hidden beneath the loam, a mysterious treasure blooms.
It's early March, and a bath-warm breeze blows across the countryside east of Kirkuk, a multi-ethnic city of one million people in northern Iraq. Men roam the hillsides in a meandering fashion, strolling slowly and changing course often in response to unseen signals. They walk pensively, arms clasped behind their backs, holding narrow trowels or long screwdrivers. They contemplate the ground, studying its nuances. Hidden next to low shrubs, covered by grass clumps or nearly obscured by the impressions of goat hooves, they seek the faint mound and tell-tale crack that reveals a desert truffle pushing its way to the surface.
Cheaper and considerably more abundant than their distant European cousins, desert truffles are part of the genus Terfezia, found throughout the Middle East and Africa. They invoke a no less fervent passion among fanatical fungus foragers here than does the Tuber magnatum. In Iraq, men have lost their lives in search of these truffles; others spend their lives in obsessive pursuit of them.
Retired Kurdish school teacher Ali Mohammed forages in the same area every year, near the village of Bawa, where his mother was born. This year, he's brought his son Aram, an engineer in Kirkuk, and his nephew, Khogir, who works for a think tank in Erbil, the capital of Iraq's autonomous Kurdish region. While the Kurdish Peshmerga fighters have shielded Kurdish regions from worst of the violence currently plaguing Iraq, a war against Islamic State militants is stretching toward its third summer, the economy is imploding, and tens of thousands of young Iraqis are leaving the country for Europe. Aram is looking for a way out, while Khogir is still on the fence. A day out truffle hunting provides a welcome distraction.
Retired school teacher Ali takes time out from truffle hunting for his lunch time prayer.
Ali is an eagle-eyed hunter, completely fixated on unearthing the subterranean fungi. Aram and Khogir adopt a more leisurely approach, taking the time to elucidate on some of the finer points of truffle hunting. As we walk, they spin tales of successful expeditions, interweaving their anecdotes with snippets of local lore. Beyond their flavor—less pungent than the European variety—desert truffles are prized for their medicinal properties. A saying of the Prophet Mohammed suggests that when cooked as a soup, truffles make an effective remedy for ailments of the eye. Men also believe that eating truffles will enhance their potency and performance. “I don't know, though,” says Khogir, a bachelor. “I'm not yet performing.”
As with their European counterparts, these truffles form a symbiotic relationship with the roots of specific plants and grow only in certain types of sandy soil under the right conditions. That makes cultivating them extremely difficult and predicting where they will grow in the wild more art than a science. Prize spots can be closely guarded secrets and hunters do not share all their techniques for finding truffles. Local legend holds that heavy thunder causes the spores to germinate, leading to expectations of poor harvests in years during which there are no lightning storms.
“Here, look.” Khogir plunges his trowel beneath a scarcely noticeable bulge in the ground. As he carefully lifts the mound upward, the soil cleaves apart to reveal a dark object the size of a small potato. Bowing our heads as if in prayer, we carefully wipe off the dirt to inspect it. It's light but firm and has a slightly musty odor.
“Now we find his cousins,” says Khogir. Where one is found, others are likely to be discovered nearby.
Khogir carefully removes a truffle from the earth.
“I have a friend who collected 17 kilograms”—nearly 40 pounds—“in a single day,” Aram says later. In comparison, the few truffles in the plastic bag hanging from his belt would weigh a few ounces at most. “I asked to go with him next time he went and he agreed, but when I told him I wanted to follow him, he said, ‘No way!'”
Across the landscape, small divots indicate where earlier foragers have already excavated their prizes. “We're too late here,” says Khogir.
To find foraging spots that others have not can be dangerous in this region. A month before, two Kurds from the town of Kifry walked out past Kurdish peshmerga positions toward villages under the control of ISIS and went hunting for truffles in no-man's land. The men were captured by ISIS militants and were later beheaded. Khogir relates this anecdote with a shrug, as if the self-evident allure of truffles explains the men's motivations. In southern Iraq, truffle hunters risk death by foraging in areas that have been mined.
Truffle hunters stroll with their heads down, looking for the slight cracks which indicate a truffle.
Back in Kirkuk, men rush down the street to inspect the first truffles of the season when they reach the market. They are sorted according to variety and size and sold mostly for consumption at home. The larger ones are selling for about 12,000 dinars a kilo this year (approximately $5 a pound), the small ones for less than 9,000. That's cheaper than the European variety, but still a day's wages for a manual laborer in Kirkuk. With oil prices low and the war against ISIS dragging on, the economy is severely depressed. “Nobody has any money right now,” says Khogir, and prices are lower than in previous years.
Talk of truffles long enough in Kirkuk, and your questions will eventually be directed toward Azad Khanaqa. Dr. Azad, as he is known locally, is undoubtedly Kirkuk's most illustrious truffle hunter, whose childhood memories of searching for truffles on his father's estates started him on a decades-long journey to solve the mystery of what makes them grow.
Azad lives in Ireland now but comes from a prominent local family. I am soon in touch with Goran, the husband of one of Azad's nieces. Family commitments prevent Goran from getting out truffle hunting much these days, but he finds time to take me on a tour of the rolling farmland on which Azad grew up. Goran is still a dedicated truffle consumer, he tells me, buying up to 50 pounds at a time when they hit the markets and storing them in his freezer.
He also has an ample supply of truffle trivia and opinions. The black truffles are better than the white variety, he says. “Kurdish land makes black domalan,” he says, using the Kurdish word for truffles. “White is Arab domalan,” and, he adds, no good.
A man sells truffles in Kirkuk. This year a kilo of smaller truffles like these sells for IQD9,000. (So a pound sells for about $4.)
Later, I reach Azad via Viber. At a young age, Azad became transfixed by the mysteries of how truffles grow. So he studied agriculture in Baghdad and later in Germany, continuing his research at the University of Göttingen. His studies confirmed the folkloric belief in a correlation between the winter storms and truffle production: The rains hatch the seeds of certain plants with which truffles form a symbiotic relationship, their spores living in their root systems. The lightning from those storms fixes nitrogen in the soil, encouraging the truffles to thrive. But replicating this process proved nearly impossible.
By the time he finished his doctorate, he still hadn't found a way to cultivate truffles and in 1980 returned to Baghdad. There he worked for the government researching mushrooms and, of course, truffles. The Iran-Iraq War was ongoing and as casualties mounted, President Saddam Hussein introduced conscription. “I said that's crazy, after studying for so long, to go to war, for what?”
So Azad returned to Germany to continue looking for a culture that would germinate truffle spores in the laboratory. After eight years at Hanover University, he had exhausted his funding and was still no closer to success. “The university professor told me, ‘Nobody can do it,'” he recalls. “I prayed for myself.”
He continued his research, paying his own way this time. And then, in 1994, after trying and failing with more than 10,000 petri dish cultures, he had a breakthrough. Spores on a dish germinated and he was able to successfully introduce them onto the root stock of plants in a nursery. Amid a flurry of media attention, big offers rolled in from across the world to buy trees with roots infected with truffle spores. A research institute was named after him at Hanover, and a lucrative contract to grow truffles for Prince Khaled bin Sultan in Saudi Arabia followed.
Today, Azad has truffières—truffle orchards—across Europe. But so far, he has not been successful in growing them in Iraq. Between the instability and the political climate—he's a staunch critic of the Kurdistan Regional Government—he doesn't spend much time in Iraq these days and has to rely on local partners. However, these intermediaries have been skeptical that the upfront investment and lengthy cultivation period before the inoculated trees start producing truffles are worthwhile.
One attempt ended in disaster after a business partner tore up 5,000 of his truffle-infected plants. “He said, ‘How can I wait three years?' and he took out the plants which I had brought from Cyprus and grew cucumber and tomatoes.” Azad recently brought in another batch of inoculated seedlings, but it will be at least three years before they start producing.
Khogir's truffles at the end of a day's foraging.
Following our foraging expedition, there remains the preparation of the truffles, which leads to debate. Azad suggests simply frying in oil. Khogir and Goran insist on boiling the truffles first. Barbecuing on skewers is apparently also suitable. All agree that the grit must be carefully scraped from the delicate skin. Khogir oversees the preparation of our meager haul, taking meticulous care to remove every grain of sand. The cooking water produces an earthy liquor that is reserved as a soup while the thinly sliced flesh is fried with raisins and served on rice. The taste is similar to mushrooms, with a firmer flesh the consistency of artichoke hearts. The resulting meal is enjoyable, if somewhat underwhelming considering the effort.
But perhaps the real allure is the act of gathering the truffles. Kurds were once largely nomadic people, and great foragers. Elsewhere in the Middle East, bedouins are also renowned truffle hunters. In Iraqi Kurdistan, people eagerly await the changing of the seasons for the new produce it will bring: the first fresh almonds or pomegranates, waterside greens gathered during a picnic, wild rhubarb picked on a mountain hike, or a bunch of sour sumac berries pulled from a bush on the side of the road. The gathering of wild food is the continuation of a timeless tradition.
As we slurp up the last of the soup and scrape the pan out with bread, we are already planning our next expedition.

This Saturday, Reno's new soccer team, Reno 1868 FC, will have its regular season opener at Greater Nevada Field. Shortly after that, the Reno Aces will have their home opener on the very same field.
For the grounds-keeping crew, it's a true juggling act to prepare for two sports in the same stadium.
It's not unheard of, but it is unusual - two teams from two different sports sharing the same field during the same season.
“I think the first consideration was whether or not we could maintain a world class surface for both sports,” said Eric Edelstein, president for both the Reno 1868 and Reno Aces.
The first step was finding a groundskeeper who could handle the juggling act. His name is Joe Hill. He's got major league experience with the Mets, Mariners and Red Sox, but took the job in Reno for the challenge of taking on two different sports.
“It was a major attraction for me having two sports, and it's a huge challenge,” said Hill. “I've never done it before, and it felt like something that was going to be a great move for my career."
The main transformation from the baseball field to a soccer pitch takes place on the left side of the infield. There, the dirt is covered up with landscape fabric and then sod.
The goal is making it an almost perfect match with the outfield grass.
“We taper it, so when this sod comes in it matches perfectly and is perfectly flat,” explains Hill.
There's going to be a handful of really quick turnarounds between the two sports at Greater Nevada Field, but none more crucial then July 4th weekend, when they'll be playing soccer on the 3rd and baseball the very next day.
“It's an all-hands-on-deck when we have a short window like that,” says Hill. “We will have to have everybody involved. Everybody does their part, and we couldn't do it without that team.”
The general manager of the soccer team, Andy Smith, calls the balancing act amazing - immaculate for his team and the baseball guys.
“The grass they've been growing off-site matches what we have here in the outfield. And when they line it up, he dials it in and it's just beautiful,” says Smith.
Hill adds, “The most important thing is that they're both our teams and we want them to have the best field that they can have, so we shoot for that every single time.”
The time is now for their very first test this weekend against Orange County SC.
If you can't make it to the game, My21 Reno will have every Reno 1868 home game live.

(WIRED) -- The end of the internet comes not with a bang or a procession of four lolcats of the apocalypse, but just with two blinking lights on a modem.
At least that's how it came for Andre Vrignaud, a 39-year-old gaming consultant in Seattle, when Comcast shut him off from the internet for using too much data.
Vrignaud, it seems, committed the foul of using more than 250 GB of data on Comcast two months in a row, triggering the company's overage policy that results in a year-long ban from using its services.
"It's one of those things I never thought would hit me," Vrignaud said. "They didn't even call. I just got double blinking lights on my modem."
"If I'd been foolish enough to depend on something like Skype or some other VOIP service for 911, I would have been hosed," Vrignaud said, arguing that internet service has become a utility much like water and electricity -- services that can't easily be turned off, due to regulations.
It was the second month in a row that Vrignaud got those blinking lights. The first time he called in and tried to figure out what the problem was.
So he turned off the router he had that was open to the public, and asked his roommate to go a bit lighter on data usage, since his household is heavy on streaming media, including YouTube, NetFlix and Pandora.
WIRED: Shed a tear, the age of broadband caps begins
What he didn't count on, Vrignaud said, was that Comcast, who he was paying $60 a month for a 15Mbps download speed, was counting uploads against the quota as well.
Just recently he'd switched his online backup system from Mozy to Carbonite, after Mozy put an end to its unlimited back-up service. Carbonite has no such limit, but does throttle users' uploads once it hits a high level.
And Vrignaud, a hardcore geek who at one point worked as a Microsoft technology evangelist for XBox 360 and XBox live, has a lot of data he shares with the cloud.
He's got his music ripped into lossless FLAC format, in addition to lower rates, amounting to about a gig a disc -- which he stores in a basement RAID server that can handle 12 TB of data. (He says it has plenty of empty space.)
WIRED: AT&T puts broadband users on monthly allowance
As an amateur photographer, he saves his photos in RAW format, which can run to about 10MB per image. And when Amazon last week opened up its cloud music service to unlimited storage of music files in AAC, Vrignaud batch-converted his collection and began uploading it.
The music is what he assumes caused the problem, but he's not sure. He admits to doing a little bittorrenting in the last month, but says it was limited to getting a few episodes of a famous British sci-fi show that's not totally available in the U.S.
And all Comcast is saying is that he's kicked off -- and under the terms of the ban, he can't even switch to a uncapped, higher-priced, lower-speed business connection.
Comcast told Wired.com that Vrignaud is at fault for not monitoring his bandwidth better.
Spokesman Charlie Douglas says the 250 GB limit, which it imposed in October 2008 after agreeing to not throttle peer-to-peer traffic, is intended to keep users like Vrignaud from impacting their neighbors. Median data usage for its cable internet customers is 4 to 6 GBs per month, according to Douglas.
WIRED: Verizon halts unlimited smartphone data plans
"Looking at the facts, it appears that it is a straightforward story," Douglas said. "There's not much we can say. We called and reiterated the policy and told him if he did exceed it again in six months, he would face suspension. That is our policy."
"If someone's behavior is such that it degrades the quality of service for others nearby -- that's what this threshold is meant to address," Douglas said. "It can negatively affect other people."
That's in part because cable internet connections work off a loop of cable shared by a collection of customers. The more data being used, the slower everyone's speed gets, unless the company spends the money to break a loop into smaller loops.
(This is why cable connections can get very slow in the evening, when many people go online for entertainment.)
You might think that Comcast is trying to save money on bandwidth by capping the GBs.
But data usage is not very expensive for a large ISP. It's somewhere around 2 cents per GB of traffic sent to or received from the greater internet, and the prices keep dropping.
WIRED: Comcast rolls out broadband meters coast and coast
Oddly though, the 250 GB cap hasn't increased at all since '08, even as Comcast has aggressively adopted better technology called DOCSIS that lets them send more and more data through the same size pipes, which the company has used to increase the speed of customers' connections, mostly without charge.
The policy is ostensibly meant to help with congestion at peak times, but it makes no differentiation between data used in the evenings and that used from midnight to 8 a.m. when internet usage typically falls off.
That's a model that Americans are very familiar with, thanks to mobile phone calling plans that discourage calling during weekday business hours, when minutes are counted against a preset quota, while making nights and weekends calls free.
However, the simple total bandwidth model is the one that's become popular. AT&T recently slapped a 150 GB per month cap on its DSL service, while Time Warner Cable trialed services with extremely low caps, only to retreat after intense protest by customers and politicians.
On the mobile front, AT&T, Verizon and T-Mobile all have caps on mobile data usage (with varying penalties and overcharges), leaving only Sprint without any real cap.
Vrignaud, like many others, thinks Comcast's limits are really about trying to protect its core video cable business from people switching to online alternatives such as Netflix and Hulu.
Vrignaud says he's weighing his other connectivity options -- which are limited to some relatively slow DSL connections and the troubled Clearwire 4G to the home servie. Verizon laid some fiber near Seattle, but Comcast's franchise agreements with the city prohibited Verizon from laying fiber in the city proper -- and Verizon has since given up on the area.
So for now he's using neighbors' open access points and internet cafes to do his business, many of which are powered by Comcast.
But he's vowing not giving up quietly and has already posted about the cutoff on his blog, which attracted more than 130 comments by Wednesday -- not all of them supportive.
Vrignaud vows to plead his case to politicians and regulators.
"I struggle when I watch Comcast raising broadband speeds, and at same time, saying they can't afford all this internet usage, without doing deep packet inspection and other invasive things," Vrignaud said. "They haven't laid new cable in 15 years. I'm pretty much a nonregulation guy, and I'd just rather let the market be competitive. But I get really frustrated in situations like this where what is truly a bad company is not being forced to improve because it doesn't have to. I really don't have any choices here."
Comcast sees it differently.
"People should be careful if they have a terabyte of data to back-up," Douglas said. "They should manage their consumption carefully, and do it over time."

When we first announced the formation of Digital Currency Group in October 2015, we were joined by a terrific group of investors who were eager to explore the nascent bitcoin and blockchain technology ecosystem. At Digital Currency Group, we build and support bitcoin and blockchain companies through our network, insights and access to capital. Over the past year, our portfolio has grown to encompass 70 companies spanning 22 countries and we now operate three wholly-owned subsidiaries including CoinDesk, a media and events platform we acquired in January 2016.
New Investors
We are proud to announce that over the past six months both our firm and team have continued to grow. We have been joined by a group of new investors including Western Union, Beijing-based HCM International Company, and a number of family offices, investment managers, and funds including Gibraltar Ventures, OMERS Ventures, Horizon Kinetics, Kingsbridge Wealth Management, and Wood Investment Partners.
Our investors now span various segments of the financial industry, from banks to insurance companies to global money transfer and payments companies who see the potential of digital currencies and their many applications. It also includes manufacturing companies and media companies looking to leverage digital currencies and distributed ledgers to create new efficiencies in their business and build new products and services that make the movement of assets and money around the world instant, frictionless, and truly borderless.
Our team believes that neither a standalone venture capital nor standalone private equity model is perfectly suited to support – and help drive forward – new industries like ours. This is why we set out to create a company, not a fund, that could have the flexibility and permanent capital base needed to invest in technology and build service businesses to enable institutions, corporations and investors to access digital currency and distributed ledger technologies in new ways.
Over the past six months, we have worked with our investors and other corporate partners to create new models for partnership that create value and opportunity for our portfolio companies, our investors, and the broader corporate ecosystem. Our aim is to help companies learn together and build partnerships that leverage the unique strengths and insights of each stakeholder. We continue to believe that collaboration and partnership between startups, incumbents and the industry will be a winning recipe in helping this new technology achieve its true potential and accelerating the development of a better financial system.
Expanding the DCG Team
We realize that our vision is broad and ambitious; to that effect, we are honored to be guided by the experience and wisdom of new members of our board and advisory team who will help us realize the vision for Digital Currency Group.
Glenn Hutchins has joined the DCG Board of Directors and provides valuable insights to our executive team. Glenn is the Chairman of North Island and a Co-Founder of Silver Lake, which he started in 1999. He is a director of both AT&T and Nasdaq, Inc.; a director of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York; vice chairman of both the Brookings Institution and the Economic Club of New York; and a member of the Executive Committee of the New York Presbyterian Hospital. He is also an owner and member of the Executive Committee of the National Basketball Association's Boston Celtics.
Mr. Hutchins remarked “Digital Currency Group (DCG) has positioned itself as a key participant in the Bitcoin universe, a space which has the promise to be one of the most innovative sectors of today's technology ecosystem. Bitcoin technology has the potential, among many other impacts, to transform the global payments system and DCG aims to be a central force in the transformation.”
In addition, long-time advisor Lawrence Lenihan will join Mr. Hutchins and DCG Founder and CEO Barry Silbert on our board. Lawrence is the Co-Founder and Co-CEO of Resonance, a venture operating company that partners with talented creators to transform the fashion industry by uniquely combining venture investing experience, fashion industry insight and expertise, manufacturing knowledge and capability and technology vision. Prior to Resonance, Lawrence founded FirstMark Capital in New York City which has backed some of the most successful commerce companies in the market today including Tommy John, Pinterest and Shopify. Lawrence is an Adjunct Professor at NYU's Stern School where he teaches Next Generation Retail.
Says Lenihan “Barry is a financial services industry visionary. He created the secondary market for private companies and then became one of the earliest public backers of blockchain technology. It will be an honor to assist and advise in this next leg of the development of DCG.”
We are also excited to have Dr. Lawrence H. Summers and Gavin Andresen joining the DCG team as Senior Advisors. Dr. Summers brings a wealth of perspective to the table, having served as the 71st Secretary of the Treasury for President Clinton and the Director of the National Economic Council for President Obama. Dr. Summers is currently the Charles W. Eliot University Professor and President Emeritus at Harvard University.
Dr. Summers commented, “Digital currencies, blockchain and ‘the internet of value' will create new platforms for financial inclusion, and Barry and his team at DCG are building an important platform with great potential to help these technologies reach mass adoption.”
Gavin Andresen is one of the developers of the bitcoin protocol, and was the lead developer for several years after the anonymous creator of bitcoin, Satoshi Nakamoto, stepped back. He is currently with the MIT Digital Currency Initiative.
The addition of these advisors underscores the importance of the various stakeholders DCG feels will be critical to helping digital currencies and their applications reach a broad group of users and achieve mainstream adoption. All of our advisors will be speaking at Consensus 2016, a conference hosted by our subsidiary CoinDesk and sponsored by DCG, on May 2 – 4 in New York City.
Looking Forward
We are honored to have the support of so many fantastic investors and advisors and the trust of our portfolio companies and subsidiaries who are looking to us for not just capital, but an opportunity to leverage our insights and engage with our broad network. The DCG family continues to grow, and we are excited to continue supporting and building meaningful businesses in the digital currency and distributed ledger space.
– Barry Siert, Founder & CEO
The Stone is a forum for contemporary philosophers and other thinkers on issues both timely and timeless.
In a 2005 news report about the Shaolin Temple, the Buddhist monastery in China well-known for its martial arts, a monk addressed a common misunderstanding: “Many people have a misconception that martial arts is about fighting and killing,” the monk was quoted as saying, “It is actually about improving your wisdom and intelligence.”[1]
Indeed, the concept of kung fu (or gongfu) is known to many in the West only through martial arts fighting films like “Enter the Dragon,” “Drunken Master” or more recently, “Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.” In the cinematic realm, skilled, acrobatic fighters like Bruce Lee, Jackie Chan and Jet Li are seen as “kung fu masters.”
The predominant orientation of traditional Chinese philosophy is the concern about how to live one's life, rather than finding out the truth about reality.
But as the Shaolin monk pointed out, kung fu embodies much more than fighting. In fact any ability resulting from practice and cultivation could accurately be said to embody kung fu. There is a kung fu of dancing, painting, cooking, writing, acting, making good judgments, dealing with people, even governing. During the Song and Ming dynasties in China, the term kung fu was widely used by the neo-Confucians, the Daoists and Buddhists alike for the art of living one's life in general, and they all unequivocally spoke of their teachings as different schools of kung fu.
This broad understanding of kung fu is a key (though by no means the only key) through which we can begin to understand traditional Chinese philosophy and the places in which it meets and departs from philosophical traditions of the West. As many scholars have pointed out, the predominant orientation of traditional Chinese philosophy is the concern about how to live one's life, rather than finding out the truth about reality.
The well-known question posed by Zhuangzi in the 4th century B.C. — was he Zhuangzi who had dreamt of being a butterfly or was he a butterfly dreaming he was Zhuangzi? — which pre-dated virtual reality and “The Matrix” by a couple of thousand years, was as much a kung fu inspiration as it was an epistemological query. Instead of leading to a search for certainty, as Descartes's dream did, Zhuangzi came to the realization that he had perceived “the transformation of things,” indicating that one should go along with this transformation rather than trying in vain to search for what is real.
Confucius's call for “rectification of names” — one must use words appropriately — is more a kung fu method for securing sociopolitical order than for capturing the essence of things, as “names,” or words, are placeholders for expectations of how the bearer of the names should behave and be treated. This points to a realization of what J. L. Austin calls the “performative” function of language. Similarly, the views of Mencius and his later opponent Xunzi's views about human nature are more recommendations of how one should view oneself in order to become a better person than metaphysical assertions about whether humans are by nature good or bad. Though each man's assertions about human nature are incompatible with each other, they may still function inside the Confucian tradition as alternative ways of cultivation.
Erin Schell
The Buddhist doctrine of no-self surely looks metaphysical, but its real aim is to free one from suffering, since according to Buddhism suffering comes ultimately from attachment to the self. Buddhist meditations are kung fu practices to shake off one's attachment, and not just intellectual inquiries for getting propositional truth.
Mistaking the language of Chinese philosophy for, in Richard Rorty's phrase, a “mirror of nature” is like mistaking the menu for the food. The essence of kung fu — various arts and instructions about how to cultivate the person and conduct one's life — is often hard to digest for those who are used to the flavor and texture of mainstream Western philosophy. It is understandable that, even after sincere willingness to try, one is often still turned away by the lack of clear definitions of key terms and the absence of linear arguments in classic Chinese texts. This, however, is not a weakness, but rather a requirement of the kung fu orientation — not unlike the way that learning how to swim requires one to focus on practice and not on conceptual understanding. Only by going beyond conceptual descriptions of reality can one open up to the intelligence that is best exemplified through arts like dancing and performing.
Philosophers' ideas, even when theoretical, have never stopped functioning as guides to human life.
This sensitivity to the style, subtle tendencies and holistic vision requires an insight similar to that needed to overcome what Jacques Derrida identified as the problem of Western logocentrism. It even expands epistemology into the non-conceptual realm in which the accessibility of knowledge is dependent on the cultivation of cognitive abilities, and not simply on whatever is “publicly observable” to everyone. It also shows that cultivation of the person is not confined to “knowing how.” An exemplary person may well have the great charisma to affect others but does not necessarily know how to affect others. In the art of kung fu, there is what Herbert Fingarette calls “the magical,” but “distinctively human” dimension of our practicality, a dimension that “always involves great effects produced effortlessly, marvelously, with an irresistible power that is itself intangible, invisible, unmanifest.”[2]
Pierre Hadot and Martha Nussbaum, partially as a result of the world-historical dialogue of philosophy in our time, have both tried to “rectify the name” of “philosophy” by showing that ancient Western philosophers such as Socrates, the Stoics and the Epicurians were mainly concerned with virtue, with spiritual exercises and practices for the sake of living a good life rather than with pure theoretical endeavors.[3] In this regard, Western philosophy at its origin is similar to classic Chinese philosophy. The significance of this point is not merely in revealing historical facts. It calls our attention to a dimension that has been eclipsed by the obsession with the search for eternal, universal truth and the way it is practiced, namely through rational arguments. Even when philosophers take their ideas as pure theoretical discourse aimed at finding the Truth, their ideas have never stopped functioning as guides to human life. The power of modern enlightenment ideas have been demonstrated fully both in the form of great achievements we have witnessed since the modern era and in the form of profound problems we are facing today. Our modes of behavior are very much shaped by philosophical ideas that looked innocent enough to be taken for granted. It is both ironic and alarming that when Richard Rorty launched full-scale attacks on modern rationalistic philosophy, he took for granted that philosophy can only take the form of seeking for objective Truth. His rejection of philosophy falls into the same trap that he cautions people about — taking philosophical ideas merely as “mirrors” and not as “levers.”
One might well consider the Chinese kung fu perspective a form of pragmatism. The proximity between the two is probably why the latter was well received in China early last century when John Dewey toured the country. What the kung fu perspective adds to the pragmatic approach, however, is its clear emphasis on the cultivation and transformation of the person, a dimension that is already in Dewey and William James but that often gets neglected. A kung fu master does not simply make good choices and use effective instruments to satisfy whatever preferences a person happens to have. In fact the subject is never simply accepted as a given. While an efficacious action may be the result of a sound rational decision, a good action that demonstrates kung fu has to be rooted in the entire person, including one's bodily dispositions and sentiments, and its goodness is displayed not only through its consequences but also in the artistic style one does it. It also brings forward what Charles Taylor calls the “background” — elements such as tradition and community — in our understanding of the formation of a person's beliefs and attitudes. Through the kung fu approach, classic Chinese philosophy displays a holistic vision that brings together these marginalized dimensions and thereby forces one to pay close attention to the ways they affect each other.
This kung fu approach shares a lot of insights with the Aristotelian virtue ethics, which focuses on the cultivation of the agent instead of on the formulation of rules of conduct. Yet unlike Aristotelian ethics, the kung fu approach to ethics does not rely on any metaphysics for justification. One does not have to believe in a pre-determined telos for humans in order to appreciate the excellence that kung fu brings. This approach does lead to recognition of the important guiding function of metaphysical outlooks though. For instance a person who follows the Aristotelian metaphysics will clearly place more effort in cultivating her intelligence, whereas a person who follows the Confucian relational metaphysics will pay more attention to learning rituals that would harmonize interpersonal relations. This approach opens up the possibility of allowing multiple competing visions of excellence, including the metaphysics or religious beliefs by which they are understood and guided, and justification of these beliefs is then left to the concrete human experiences.
The kung fu approach does not entail that might is right. This is one reason why it is more appropriate to consider kung fu as a form of art. Art is not ultimately measured by its dominance of the market. In addition, the function of art is not accurate reflection of the real world; its expression is not constrained to the form of universal principles and logical reasoning, and it requires cultivation of the artist, embodiment of virtues/virtuosities, and imagination and creativity. If philosophy is “a way of life,” as Pierre Hadot puts it, the kung fu approach suggests that we take philosophy as the pursuit of the art of living well, and not just as a narrowly defined rational way of life.

Story highlights Christie and his family starred in ads for New Jersey tourism after Sandy
New Jersey Democratic Rep. Pallone said he was concerned about bidding process
Christie fired two aides last week over the George Washington Bridge scandal
Christie's office says it worked with the Obama administration on marketing plan
Just days after dismissing two top advisers for their roles in the George Washington Bridge scandal, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie faced questions over the use of Superstorm Sandy relief funds.
CNN has learned that federal officials are investigating whether Christie improperly used some of that money to produce tourism ads that starred him and his family.
The news couldn't come at a worse time for the embattled Republican, who is facing two probes in New Jersey of whether his staff orchestrated traffic gridlock near the country's busiest bridge to punish a Democratic mayor who refused to endorse his re-election.
If the Sandy inquiry by a watchdog finds any wrongdoing, it could prove even more damaging to Christie's national ambitions. He's considered a possible presidential candidate in 2016.

His performance during and after the October 2012 storm just before the presidential election has been widely praised and is a fundamental illustration of his straight-shooting political brand.
In the new investigation, federal auditors will examine New Jersey's use of $25 million in Sandy relief funds for a marketing campaign to promote tourism at the Jersey Shore, New Jersey Democratic Rep. Frank Pallone told CNN
In an August letter , Pallone asked the Department of Housing and Urban Development inspector general to look into how Christie chose to spend the marketing money approved by the department.
The inspector general's office confirmed the investigation.
Pallone wrote that he was concerned about the bidding process for the firm awarded the marketing plan; the winning firm is charging the state about $2 million more than the next lowest bidder.
The winning bid of $4.7 million featured Christie and his family in the advertisements while the losing $2.5 million proposal did not feature the Christies, Pallone said.
On Sunday, Pallone told CNN that the inspector general conducted a preliminary review and concluded there was enough evidence to launch a full-scale investigation into the state's use of federal funds.
The audit will take several months and the findings will be issued in an official report, he said.
Pallone, a 27-year veteran of the House and vocal Christie critic, said this is not about politics.
"This was money that could have directly been used for Sandy recovery. And, as you know, many of my constituents still haven't gotten the money that is owed them to rebuild their homes or raise their homes or to help," he said.

Democrats slammed Christie over the summer for starring in taxpayer-funded ads as he was running for re-election in November, arguing it gave him an unfair advantage.
Christie aides said at the time that the winning bid provided more value.
In a statement on Monday, Christie's office said the "Stronger than the Storm" campaign was part of an "action plan" approved by the Obama administration and developed with the goal of showing that the New Jersey shore was open for business just several months after the storm.
"Federal agency reviews are routine and standard operating procedure with all federally allocated resources to ensure that funds are distributed fairly. We're confident that any review will show that the ads were a key part in helping New Jersey get back on its feet after being struck by the worst storm in state history," according to the statement issued in response to questions from CNN.
Last week, Christie dismissed two top aides for their apparent involvement in the closure of access lanes to the George Washington Bridge, which caused traffic nightmares for days in and around Fort Lee.
New Jersey legislators are investigating whether the aides -- a senior Christie staffer and a high-level appointee at the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey -- ordered the lane closures as political retribution. The U.S. Attorney in New Jersey also is looking into the matter.
Christie has said he didn't know about the alleged scheme and was "embarrassed and humiliated" by it.
Democrats in New Jersey and nationally have jumped on the scandal, saying it gives the nation a chance to see what they've said for years -- that Christie is a bully who governs by fear. His supporters say his swagger and frank nature convey confidence and have helped make him a successful governor.
But as bad as the bridge scandal is for Christie, any finding that he improperly spent Sandy aid would tarnish the signature achievement that has helped elevate his legacy and made him a serious potential challenger for the White House.
Sandy, a historic storm, pummeled coastal areas along the mid-Atlantic, knocking out power to millions, causing massive flooding and killing more than 100 people in the United States.
Parts of the New Jersey shore were devastated, but the state and local communities in many hard-hit areas rebounded surprisingly quickly and reopened their beaches last summer.
Christie and President Barack Obama toured one community in May to demonstrate the effectiveness of recovery efforts helped by billions in federal money that went to New Jersey and other states affected by the storm.
EASTHAMPTON – Cottage Street here is now an official state recognized Cultural District.
At a meeting in Springfield Friday, the Massachusetts Cultural Council unanimously approved the district's creation.
The city applied for the designation earlier this year.
Initially, the proposal when created last year had included Cottage, Union and Main streets and a portion of Payson Avenue.
But the key was the district had to be walkable, said Easthampton City Arts+ Coordinator Burns Maxey.
The cultural council created the district initiative from an economic stimulus bill passed by the Massachusetts Legislature in 2010. The district is a “tool to get us recognized as a (cultural district) designation,” Maxey has said.
The City Council adopted the resolution to create a district here in October, one of the necessary steps to becoming a district.
While there is no money available now, grants could be available to designated districts in the future.
“I think it's going to be a big boost for downtown,” Mayor Michael A. Tautznik said. He attended the meeting Friday. He said the designation is recognition that “we do have a core of cultural offerings.”
He said this gives the city another reason for people to visit.
Businesses within the district include Popcorn Noir, Mt. Tom's Homemade Ice Cream, the Cottage Street Studios, White Square Books and Luthier's Co-op and many others.
Tautznik said the council also designated a district in Gloucester as well.
Pittsfield and Shelburne Falls have already received the designation.
The cost to the community is about $200 for two signs to mark it.
Tautznik said the city has “five years to perfect the district.” The state sets a high bar to meet its standards.
A second Turnbull government frontbencher has been caught up in the political donations row dogging the NSW Liberals over a finding that senior party officials used a controversial body to channel prohibited donations into its 2011 state election campaign.
Liberal rising star and Assistant Minister for Cities Angus Taylor discussed use of the controversial Free Enterprise Foundation with a former key Liberal fundraiser, Paul Nicolaou, and solicited a donation from a mining company to the organisation.

The revelation comes after cabinet secretary Senator Arthur Sinodinos was last week named in a damning report by the NSW Electoral Commission over the party's use of the federally registered FEF to "disguise" donations, including from banned donors such as property developers, to the NSW division of the party.
​The discussion with Mr Taylor was revealed by Mr Nicolaou in his evidence to the Independent Commission Against Corruption in 2014 during Operation Spicer, its investigation of Liberal Party fundraising.
Walter Russell Mead paints a disturbing portrait of the United States' geopolitical predicament. As he sees it, an increasingly formidable coalition of illiberal powers -- China, Iran, and Russia -- is determined to undo the post–Cold War settlement and the U.S.-led global order that stands behind it. Across Eurasia, he argues, these aggrieved states are bent on building spheres of influence to threaten the foundations of U.S. leadership and the global order. So the United States must rethink its optimism, including its post–Cold War belief that rising non-Western states can be persuaded to join the West and play by its rules. For Mead, the time has come to confront the threats from these increasingly dangerous geopolitical foes.
But Mead's alarmism is based on a colossal misreading of modern power realities. It is a misreading of the logic and character of the existing world order, which is more stable and expansive than Mead depicts, leading him to overestimate the ability of the “axis of weevils” to undermine it. And it is a misreading of China and Russia, which are not full-scale revisionist powers but part-time spoilers at best, as suspicious of each other as they are of the outside world. True, they look for opportunities to resist the United States' global leadership, and recently, as in the past, they have pushed back against it, particularly when confronted in their own neighborhoods. But even these conflicts are fueled more by weakness -- their leaders' and regimes' -- than by strength. They have no appealing brand. And when it comes to their overriding interests, Russia and, especially, China are deeply integrated into the world economy and its governing institutions.
Mead also mischaracterizes the thrust of U.S. foreign policy. Since the end of the Cold War, he argues, the United States has ignored geopolitical issues involving territory and spheres of influence and instead adopted a Pollyannaish emphasis on building the global order. But this is a false dichotomy.
Panic rippled through Ullared, Sweden, after a car crashed outside the Gekas superstore in the town. Shoppers scattered after witnesses claimed the driver hit two shopping carts before coming to a stop. Two people are believed to have been injured in the incident, but not seriously. Police spokesman Tommy Nyman said they were struck as the car careered towards the store.
TWITTER Those at the scene said they initially thought it was an accident
Jenny Sundström, 19, and Nathalie Lodén, 20, who were at the scene, describe a white car driving at “high speed”. Ms Lodén told local media site Expressen.se: “We hear that a car starts honking. I see a white car running straight at us. “Then we took away that person is not going to give way, we move our cart.” Ms Sundström added: “We were right in front of him. He sped past us.
TWITTER Emergency services warmed the scene in the remote part of the country
“We saw how a man and a child standing there and how they could move. “We were so shocked that we were there and also afterwards and then got the guards out. “The man was charged with a gas can in his hand, and then people started running.” Others at the scene said they initially thought it was an accident, but then the driver emerged from the car holding a gas canister.

An eyewitness, named as Mans, said the driver ‘opened the can' and poured gasoline on the ground. He said: “There was a car driving alone at high speed. Just a few meters from the end, he slams in two shopping carts. “He steps out of the car and a gas can in his hand. Then I realized that this is not an accident. “He just opened the can, you can see now that it is gasoline on the ground.” It is believed security guards from the store managed to apprehend the man before police arrived, who then arrested him. Emergency services swarmed the scene in the remote part of the country, some 66 miles south of Gothenburg, Sweden.

The shopping centre, Gekas Ullared, issued a statement saying: “Two people should have received minor injuries when the car driving to the store. “Both are cared for by the emergency services. We hope everything goes well for all involved and we will do everything we can. “Right now we have no more information, and can not answer all the questions that obviously pops up when something like this happens.”
Next month, the Supreme Court will hear arguments in Whole Woman's Health v. Hellerstedt, a challenge to a restrictive Texas abortion law and a key test of the anti-choice movement's long-term strategy of eliminating abortion access by regulating abortion providers out of existence.
Central to the case is the claim that laws like the one in Texas, which could close three quarters of the state's abortion clinics if it's fully enacted, impose tough regulations on abortion providers in order to protect the health of the women who take advantage of their services.
Now, in an effort to claim that they are the ones who are really concerned about women's health, anti-choice groups are appropriating the term “back-alley abortion,” using the phrase that has long described dangerous illegal procedures in the years before Roe to claim that it is in fact legal abortion that forces women into the “back alley.”
In an article for the Federalist yesterday, Americans United for Life (AUL) attorney Mailee Smith wrote that the Texas case has “prompted a discussion about what is more important: ‘access' to the current back alley of abortion now offered by an industry that puts profits over people, or commonsense health and safety standards the Court has historically supported.”
It's a line that AUL has been repeating in the past few years, encouraged in part by the case of Kermit Gosnell, the Philadelphia abortion provider who was convicted of several gruesome crimes after the lax enforcement of regulations allowed him to stay in business.
Speaking at a Heritage Foundation event in 2013 after Gosnell's conviction, AUL's president, Chairmaine Yoest, declared, “Gosnell is sadly not an aberration. Ladies and gentlemen, we already have the back alley of abortion in this country and the back alley of abortion in this country is legal abortion.” A 2012 law review article by AUL attorney Clarke Forsythe in favor of clinic regulations was titled “A Road Map Through The Supreme Court's Back Alley.” A 2013 AUL guide to regulating abortion clinics declared, “abortion clinics across the nation have become the true ‘back alleys' of abortion mythology.”
Other groups have caught on to the messaging too. Speaking of Gosnell's conviction in 2013, the Susan B. Anthony List's Marjorie Dannenfelser claimed that “the result of the current law is that we're living back-alley abortions right now.”
In a set of talking points posted on its website in 2014, the National Right to Life Committee recommended countering pro-choice arguments about the risk of back-alley abortions by saying, “The only thing that legalizing abortion did was to give abortionists the ability to hang their shingle on the front door and stop using the back alley!”
Few would disagree that Gosnell — who was convicted of killing a patient and three infants who were born alive at his squalid clinic — was offering the functional equivalent of back-alley abortions. But the anti-choice movement is instead attempting to exploit the Gosnell case to claim that legal abortion is back-alley abortion, and to use it to justify unnecessary regulations meant to cut shut down safe providers.
Abortion rights opponents often attempt to downplay the real danger of illegal abortions women faced before the liberalization of abortion laws and Roe. Although women with money and connections could often obtain a safe hospital abortion (whether or not it was technically legal) in the years leading up to Roe, the burden of unsafe abortion fell disproportionately on poor women and women of color.
Guttmacher reports that although rates of death from unsafe abortion fell as medical care improved on all levels, 200 women died from unsafe abortion in 1965, making up 17 percent of all pregancy-related deaths that year. Even as states began to liberalize their abortion laws, many women without access to safe procedures still obtained illegal abortions.
As a number of commentators pointed out when Gosnell's crimes came to light, forcing safe clinics to close would only force more women to predatory providers like Gosnell.
From the beginning, anti-choice activists have acknowledged that clinic regulations like those in Texas are meant not to protect women but to challenge legal abortion. In a 2007 memo arguing against “personhood” laws that attempt to ban all abortions in one fell swoop, influential anti-abortion attorney James Bopp listed clinic regulations like Texas' as one way to “improve the legal situation” of the anti-abortion movement without fully taking on the constitutional right to abortion. In its annual package of model legislation for state legislators, AUL touts clinic-regulation measures as part of the effort to “unravel” Roe and facilitate its “demise.”
Texas' law, which AUL says it helped write, requires abortion clinics to remodel if they don't meet the stringent standards of ambulatory surgical clinics, which in general perform more complicated and riskier procedures than abortion. It also mandates that abortion providers have admitting privileges at a local hospital, an unnecessary requirement that it is sometimes difficult or impossible for abortion providers to meet. (This is in part because anti-abortion activists eliminating abortion access by regulating abortion providers out of existence .

Where the bed bugs are: Report shows rise in 15 cities

Start scratching. Terminix has just issued its annual list of top bed-bug infested cities. In a twist this year, the exterminator has identified the 15 top cities with the largest increase in infestations.
We'll get to that, but first, a look at where the most bed bug-specific calls from anguished (we presume) customers are coming from. Terminix has 300-plus branches nationwide.
Cities with the top number of calls related to bed bugs through May of this year:
Cincinnati
Philadelphia
Detroit
New York
Columbus
Los Angeles
Dallas
Chicago
Houston
Baltimore
The same cities have tended to pop up in various spots on the list since it debuted in 2010. Tallies for previous years are on the company's website.
The 15 cities with the greatest increases in bed bug complaint calls to Terminix:
Sacramento — 54%
Milwaukee — 53%
Las Vegas — 50%
Columbus, Ohio — 47%
Baltimore — 46%
Riverside-San Bernardino, Calif. — 41%
St. Louis — 40%
Cleveland — 36%
Louisville — 31%
Denver — 28%
Los Angeles — 27%
San Francisco — 26%
Dallas/Ft. Worth — 25%
Nashville — 17%
Houston — 15%
The Terminix press release quotes one of its entomologists as saying bed bugs have been associated with anemia, can lead to problems related to excessive scratching and can have a "psychological impact."
I stay in a lot of hotels and I've never seen a bed bug, nor have I been victim to any of the maladies mentioned here, save for occasional bouts of bed-bug hysteria triggered by reading lists like this one.
The condition causes me to whip off the top bedding for closer inspection of the sheets. I also attempt to look behind the headboard for telltale specks on the wall (though that's more often than not futile, since headboards in the grade of hotels I stay in tend to be bolted to the wall).
But more often than not, I don't think twice about these tenacious little suckers I keep reading about
Am I playing bed bug roulette? Are you on the lookout for bed bugs and, if so, have you ever seen one?

'What was the role of the auditor?'
"If finances are found to have been mis-stated in prior periods the question will be asked 'What was the role of the auditor'," one senior audit partner said.
Deloitte has been Dick Smith's auditor since 2013. Prior to that, Deloitte vetted the group's financials as part of Woolworths, whose accounts Deloitte has audited for over a decade.
"[Receivers] Ferrier Hodgson will go after anyone they can and Deloitte will be in the firing line along with directors and management," an industry insider said.
Deloitte chalked up $1.3 million in fees with Dick Smith for the 2013-14 financial year, including $784,000 for investigative accounting services in the lead-up to Anchorage Capital's controversial float of the retail group.
Experts reject any suggestion that the high level of non-audit fees in this period breaches independence guidelines, saying it is standard practice because auditors are best placed to make assumptions about future forecasts.
Inventory valuation is fundamental, particularly in a retail audit. Inventory is one of the biggest items on a retailer's balance sheet. As such, it is also one of the biggest sources of risk.
But seasoned company directors say that while Deloitte will "take a knock in the tabloids" over the episode, senior management and Dick Smith's board stand to cop the most heat.

"There will be collateral damage to lots of people but on solvency issues directors and senior management are at the forefront of the decision," a company director on several blue chip boards said.
"They [management and the board] will have engaged their own independent experts to get a brutal perspective. The auditor plays a catch-up game," he said.
New regime
Questions are also being raised about whether a new auditor reporting regime, due to start in 2017, could have averted this disaster.
Broad consensus says "No". But it should reduce the shock factor.
New "extended audit reports" will require auditors to call out key areas of risk and outline in some detail the stress testing undertaken to satisfy themselves about the financial performance and position of the company.
In the past, this information was for audit committee and senior management eyes only.
The Financial Review understands many as 20 large listed entities conducted dry runs of this new format behind closed doors in 2015.

Hearing device maker Cochlear and infrastructure giant Downer EDI took the courageous step of making these reports public ahead of the mandatory deadline.
Ferrier will be eager to see if Deloitte compiled a "shadow" extended audit report and presented it to Dick Smith's audit committee for the reporting period to June 28, and, more importantly, if it called out inventory and going concern issues as key audit matters.
Such a report, if it exists, it will be available on discovery should Ferrier commence legal proceedings.
Some company directors are confident the new regime will improve audit quality, while skeptics say key audit matters will end up being vanilla and less useful.
Unstoppable momentum
Most industry pundits feel the episode won't tarnish Deloitte's reputation in a meaningful way and won't dent the momentum it's established in the ASX200 audit space.
Deloitte performs 24 ASX200 audits, worth $35 million in combined fees, according a University of NSW analysis of auditor remuneration disclosures by ASX200 companies' in 2013 and 2014 annual reports.
This compares to PricewaterhouseCoopers which performs 58 worth $228 million, Ernst & Young which owns 55 worth $164 million, and KPMG with 48 generating annual billings of $157 million.
Historically considered a light-weight in big audit engagements, Deloitte has been painstakingly taking market share, investing heavily in experts. It pulled off a coup luring high-profile PricewaterhouseCoopers executive Richard Deutsch to head its audit division in 2014.
Last year, Mr Deutsch flagged increased investment in the firm's assurance team over the next three years as it commits resources to raid a handful of big tickets ASX 100 audits from rivals.

FORT COLLINS — Investigators released several photos and asked for the public's help Thursday in identifying the individual they believe is responsible for 166 damaged vehicles since mid-April in Fort Collins.
According to a release from Fort Collins Police Services, these vehicles are "damaged by small projectiles during nighttime and early morning hours."
Police estimate that the suspect caused anywhere from $45,000 and $75,000 worth of damage to these cars.
Investigators believe the damage to the cars, all while unoccupied, was done using a BB gun. The release stated there seems to be no discernible pattern in the locations of the incidents.
Detectives are also asking anyone in the areas of these reports who have video security systems to provide an opportunity for police to review the footage during the relevant time frames.
Police are offering a cash reward for information leading to an arrest in these cases.
Anyone with information is asked to call Sgt. Paul Wood at 224-6132 or they can contact Crime Stoppers anonymously at 221-6868 or www.stopcriminals.org.

A Richmond food wholesaler has been ordered to pay a $77,500 fine after pleading guilty to three counts of illegal possession of endangered northern abalone, under the Species at Risk Act (SARA), plus one violation of the Fisheries Act.
According to documents from Richmond Provincial Court, NG Fung Enterprises, operated by a Chi Fai “Patrick” Kwok, was visited by fishery officers on three separate occasion between December 2013 and June 2014.
article continues below
A significant quantity of abalone was discovered in the retail store, warehouse, and in a concealed storeroom. Subsequent DNA testing by the federal Department of Fisheries and Oceans' Molecular Genetics Lab, at the Pacific Biological Station in Nanaimo, confirmed the presence of endangered Northern abalone.
Due to serious conservation concerns documented by scientists and fishery managers, all abalone fisheries were closed in B.C. in 1990.
In 2003, northern abalone were listed and protected. The court document said that, despite continued efforts to rebuild abalone populations and prosecute individuals involved in illegal harvest and trade, northern abalone show little sign of recovery.
The greatest threat to the survival of this species continues to be illegal harvest, which is, in turn, driven by the illegal trade.
The Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada (COSEWIC) re-assessed the northern abalone status in 2009, designating the species as endangered because there had been little or no recovery of the wild abalone population, particularly the larger reproductive animals.

There are thousands of stories out there about cats and their intelligence. Some of them about their abilities, others about their deceitful and unfaithful character. Is the cat's behavior amazing, after all? Do cats surprise you by their sneaky moves? We identified some obvious facts that clearly make cats worthy of being a smart pet:
1. Cats are different.
Just like people are different. There is no such thing as two cats with the same character, fact which shows an important psychical evolution.
2. Cats can adapt amazingly well to any medium.
Solitary by nature, a cat can adapt without much difficulty to a group, quickly accepting the rules, the hierarchy and the constraints. Only the human being has the same advanced capability of adapting both psychologically and socially.
3. Being a cat also means correlating
curiosity with the spirit of observation and the deduction capability. The behavior of the cat when it scratches the tap and meows to ask for some fresh water, or when it uses the bathroom sink because its sleeping place is not clean enough is not exactly common.
4. The capability of using those accessories is not amazing,
but the fact that the cat understands that the tap water is fresher or the sink is cleaner. However, there are some minor “mistakes”: confusing the bath tub with the sink for example, but these are aspects that only us, humans, give attention to.
5. Cats have a very high IQ.
Surprised by the ability of the cat male to manage in almost every situation, researchers tested the cat's IQ: cats are better than dogs and horses, but situated between the mouse and monkey.
So what do you think? Are cats amazing? There is one more aspect though: the more you train your cat, the smarter it will become.

We all know mountains are dangerous. Avalanches, cliffs, and cold weather are just a few of the obstacles that people encounter when traveling in the mountains. Less widely appreciated are the hazards that mountains pose to aircraft. Ski resorts in particular tend to attract aviation disasters. A number of factors can lead to an unexpected mountainside “landing”. Frequently cited factors include: misjudging the elevation and ability of the aircraft to climb, poor visibility, and simple navigational errors. Below are five of the more interesting and notable aircraft crashes at ski resorts.
1. Best Known Mountain Air Crash: Las Leñas “Alive” Crash
Flight 571 Wreckage Marte Chairlift
Uruguayan Air Force Flight 571 crashed into the Andes Mountains on October 13, 1972. This crash is widely known, as it was made famous by the 1974 book “Alive: The Story of Andes Survivors”, and the eponymous 1993 film starring Ethan Hawke. The twin turboprop Fairchild FH-227D was flying from Montevideo to Santiago, Chile. This route required crossing the Andes Mountains. Due to inclement weather, the aircraft could not fly over the mountain range; instead, the aircraft needed to fly south along the range until reaching the Planchoon Pass. Once at the pass, the flight crew planned to turn west, and then once through the mountains, proceed north for a final descent. While traveling south, a lack of visibility forced the pilot to estimate the distance travelled based on average speed; unfortunately, the pilot neglected to account for headwinds, and turned west before reaching the pass. The plane ultimately crashed into the side of the Andes Mountains, less than six miles from Las Leñas.
Of the 45 people on board, 16 survived, 17 died in either the crash or shortly thereafter, one died on the ninth day, eight died in an avalanche that swept the plane down the mountainside on the 16th day, and three others died prior to the eventual rescue. Those who lived survived an amazing 72 days before being rescued. Unfortunately, the tragic accident was made worse by a decision to walk west towards Chile, when a town to the East was actually much closer. Today, the wreckage of the aircraft is still located on the side of the mountain. I'm told that on a clear day it can be seen from the Las Leñas chairlift.
2. Craziest Freak Accident: Mount Cermis Prowler Accident
Gondola Wreckage EA-6B Prowler
On February 3, 1998, a United States Marine Corp EA-6B Prowler was conducting military training exercises. The aircraft was flying at 540 mph between 260 and 330 feet above the ground (well below a Pentagon minimum of 1,000 feet). At 2:13 local time, the aircraft's right wing struck a gondola car cable, sending one car to the mountain floor. All 20 people on board the gondola car died. A second gondola car with an operator on board was saved by the car's brake.
The prowler landed safely at the base in Aviano, Italy, 60 miles to the north. The pilot, Captain Richard J. Ashby, was investigated but ultimately cleared of any wrongdoing. The U.S. Military blamed the accident on an inaccurate map used by the flight crew. Apparently this map did not show the gondola on it. Rumor has it that despite being cleared of all charges, the flight crew never flew a military jet again.
3. Celebrity Ski Resort Crash: Alpine Valley Stevie Ray Vaughn Helicopter Crash
Alpine Valley Resort Bell 206B Jet Ranger
On Monday August 27, 1990, musician Stevie Ray Vaughan perished in a helicopter crash on the slopes of Alpine Valley Resort in East Troy, Wisconsin. Mr. Vaughan had just completed playing a show at the resort's amphitheater with blues artists Robert Cray, Buddy Guy, Eric Clapton, and his brother Jimmie Vaughan. After the show, Mr. Vaughan boarded a Bell 206B Jet Ranger Helicopter with three members of Eric Clapton's crew (agent Bobby Brooks, bodyguard Nigel Browne, and assistant tour manager Colin Smythe), plus the pilot Jeff Brown. The helicopter crashed into the ski slopes approximately 300 feet above the takeoff position. Interestingly, the crash went unnoticed until the passengers failed to reach Chicago, their final destination. When the downed aircraft was found, it was discovered that all five people on board had been fatally injured.
4. Most Aircraft Crashes of Any Ski Resort? Magic Mountain Vermont
Magic Mountain Vermont- Aircraft Beware Remnants of a Sikorsky S-58 Helicopter
Which ski resort has seen the most aircraft crashes? The Vermont Ski and Snowboard Museum (http://www.vtssm.com/) has documented 10 aircraft crashes involving 11 aircraft at ski resorts throughout the state. Incredibly, four of these incidents involving five aircraft have occurred on or over Magic Mountain's trails. With Magic's open access glade policy, skiers can both enjoy the natural terrain, while also hunting for a piece of aircraft wreckage. Special thanks to Brian Lindner on behalf the Vermont Ski and Snowboard Museum for the info below.
On September 13, 1962, Magic was hitting its stride and expanding with the addition of what today is referred to as the Black Chair. While pouring concrete for the lift's foundation, pilot Frank Minjoy lost control of his Sikorsky S-58 Helicopter and crashed into the side of the mountain. Amazingly, Mr. Minjoy survived the accident.
Eleven years later, on February 22, 1973, Dan Delp was piloting his Cessna 310 when he got disorientated in the fog and crashed into Magic. The first people on the scene were Magic Mountain patrollers. Unfortunately, the pilot and his passenger were both killed.
On February 3, 1975, just shy of three years after the Cessna 310 crash, two General Dynamics FB-111 Aardvark fighter jets were engaging in refueling exercises over Londonderry, Vermont. The aircraft were practicing hooking up to a KC-135 tanker when the two fighters collided at 20,000 feet. Both crews safely ejected and landed 200 feet from Magic's summit.
After the excitement of the 1970s, Magic went without an aircraft crash for 28 years. This streak was broken in 2003 when James Smith failed to maintain altitude in his Cessna C-150M. He crashed above the trail “Wizard”, only 100 feet below the summit of Magic Mountain. Mr. Smith was discovered by a hiker, who was able to contact authorities for assistance. Mr. Smith suffered head injuries but survived!
Maybe I'm superstitious, but if I were a pilot, I think I'd stick to skiing Magic's rather than flying near it.
5. Coolest Adaptation of a Plane Crash: Mission Ridge
Have you ever hit Mission Ridge's B24 Terrain Park? You might be surprised to know, the park is named after a B-24 aircraft that crashed during a training mission on September 30, 1944. The story goes like this: WWII had ended in Europe, but it was unclear how long the Pacific conflict would go on. Without an end in sight, the U.S. was constantly building bombers and training their crews. On that fateful evening, the B-24 left Walla Walla Army Air Base in the rain and fog. The bomber failed to clear the mountain top by at least 600 feet. Six men died: 2nd Lt. J.D. Hunt, 2nd Lt. Ted R. Lewis, Flight Officer Robert J. Heneckes, 2nd Lt. Francis W. Lequier Jr., Corp. Calvin D. Flaming, and Corp. James R. Manthei.
I'm told that for long time, hikers could still find wreckage on the mountain. Today, the wing and a plaque are mounted at the spot of the accident. I like the incorporation of the mountain history into the present layout, but despite the cool logo, I wonder if you are tempting fate naming a terrain park where aerial tricks are performed after an aircraft crash.
Over a period of three years, a group of astrophysicists from the University of Zurich has developed and optimised a revolutionary code to describe with unprecedented accuracy the dynamics of dark matter and the formation of large-scale structures in the Universe. As Joachim Stadel, Douglas Potter and Romain Teyssier report in their recently published paper, the code (called PKDGRAV3) has been designed to use optimally the available memory and processing power of modern supercomputing architectures, such as the "Piz Daint" supercomputer of the Swiss National Computing Center (CSCS). The code was executed on this world-leading machine for only 80 hours, and generated a virtual universe of two trillion (i.e., two thousand billion or 2 x 1012) macro-particles representing the dark matter fluid, from which a catalogue of 25 billion virtual galaxies was extracted.
Studying the composition of the dark universe
Thanks to the high precision of their calculation, featuring a dark matter fluid evolving under its own gravity, the researchers have simulated the formation of small concentration of matter, called dark matter halos, in which we believe galaxies like the Milky Way form. The challenge of this simulation was to model galaxies as small as one tenth of the Milky Way, in a volume as large as our entire observable Universe. This was the requirement set by the European Euclid mission, whose main objective is to explore the dark side of the Universe.
Measuring subtle distortions
Indeed, about 95 percent of the Universe is dark. The cosmos consists of 23 percent of dark matter and 72 percent of dark energy. "The nature of dark energy remains one of the main unsolved puzzles in modern science," says Romain Teyssier, UZH professor for computational astrophysics. A puzzle that can be cracked only through indirect observation: When the Euclid satellite will capture the light of billions of galaxies in large areas of the sky, astronomers will measure very subtle distortions that arise from the deflection of light of these background galaxies by a foreground, invisible distribution of mass – dark matter. "That is comparable to the distortion of light by a somewhat uneven glass pane," says Joachim Stadel from the Institute for Computational Science of the UZH.
Optimizing observation strategies of the satellite
This new virtual galaxy catalogue will help optimize the observational strategy of the Euclid experiment and minimize various sources of error, before the satellite embarks on its six-year data collecting mission in 2020. "Euclid will perform a tomographic map of our Universe, tracing back in time more than 10-billion-year of evolution in the cosmos," Stadel says. From the Euclid data, researchers will obtain new information on the nature of this mysterious dark energy, but also hope to discover new physics beyond the standard model, such as a modified version of general relativity or a new type of particle.

IRISH TRAVELERS
Many questions are posed about these unique but tarnished individuals. What is an Irish Traveler? Why are they called Gypsies? How do they earn a living? Why are child marriages arraigned?
They sailed from their old country to expand into the territory (USA) we sometimes take for granted. Other than their European DNA, they have no known point of origin; they're traditionally called “Gypsies,” “Roma,” or “Travelers.” Wise-tales can be traced back to the mid-1800's; they've been depicted in Hollywood lore and their controversial lifestyle has flourished through the headlines of the years.
Tales of the traveler are scarce but do exist through folklore, eyewitness accounts, police records, & entertainment. A caravan of gypsies was not a rare site to see in the early 1900's. The mystical powers of crystal ball readings & spiritual advice, usually given from an older lady or man; often cloaked in gems, jewelry, scarves & yes, the hat. Mystical powers were often advertised, but were they real?
Films such as Traveller (1997), starring Bill Paxton & Mark Walhberg as a pair of traveling Gypsies have added to the ongoing curiosity. In the film, they pull simple scams to lure in their victims. Scams are not only a part of the folklore that accompanies Irish Travelers, it's their livelihood. The film, Snatch (2000), starring Brad Pitt as an Irishman, referred to as (Pikey) in the film — which is a derogatory term for a Traveler. Bare-knuckle boxing & scams run rampant throughout this movie, a European-take on the subject-matter. Thinner (1996), a product of Steven King, showcased the Gypsies as traveling fortune-tellers, casting curses upon their victims.

Shrouded in mystery, their lifestyle also provides an in-depth blueprint into the development of their morals. Child marriage is a common theme within the Travelers; often girls & boys – young as 12, are positioned into a marriage ceremony or engagements that align with the better good of the establishment. The largest settlement of Travelers can be found in Murphy Village, a compound located outside of North Augusta, South Carolina. They've recently been projected into the spotlight via the RICO ACT (Federal Fraud Charges) have been brought against 22 members of Murphy Village. Their pre-trial date is for November, 30th, 2016. Alleged sex crimes have also been at the forefront of a new investigation regarding children located in the Village.
Is this a modern-day conspiracy taking place against men & women with a different lifestyle, or is the conspiracy the Travelers themselves? Although these scams & others are often associated with Gypsies, not all practice this way of life. Many Gypsies marry a GORGER (Non-Gypsy), sometimes abandoning their way of life for a GORGER or vice versa.
Scams associated with the Travelers include…
CRYSTAL POWERS
This was a common theme during the early 1900's. A traveling caravan would stop by nearby towns, associated with festivals or sideshows. The MAGICAL & ALL-SEEING GYPSY would tell your fortune. People with mental issues or grief-stricken were perfect victims (repeat customers). Parlor tricks & simple psychology were just the beginning, they would often rob the individual, robbing them of their horse or personal belongings, this was usually performed by an apprentice (a kid).
PAINT & GO
A group of men will arrive at a household (usually the elderly). They present themselves as workers from a nearby area who & have extra supplies; they're willing to make a deal since they do not want the materials to go to waste. They offer to paint your house or spray your driveway (to fill in the cracks), only accepting cash. The materials they use are watered-down, outdated, & barely function-able. They leave the job unfinished – the after-effects cost the homeowner more money to fix the problem.
FRONT DOOR, BACK DOOR
A knock… then… another one. The man standing at your front door… you don't recognize. They claim to be an insurance salesman and would like to have a chat with you about their new program, which guarantees acceptance for citizens over the age of 70. You're not intrigued, but this interaction takes a total of 5 minutes, he's quite the fella. You go back inside. The next day you notice misplaced items in your bedroom; your jewelry is missing. This takes place in rural areas of the south; the victims are home alone & have been scouted out for their vulnerability.

The number of U.S. honeybees, a critical component to agricultural production, rose in 2017 from a year earlier, and deaths of the insects attributed to a mysterious malady that's affected hives in North America and Europe declined, according a U.S. Department of Agriculture honeybee health survey released Tuesday.
The number of commercial U.S. honeybee colonies rose 3 percent to 2.89 million as of April 1, 2017 compared with a year earlier, the Agriculture Department reported. The number of hives lost to Colony Collapse Disorder, a phenomenon of disappearing bees that has raised concerns among farmers and scientists for a decade, was 84,430 in this year's first quarter, down 27 percent from a year earlier. Year-over-year losses declined by the same percentage in April through June, the most recent data in the survey.
Still, more than two-fifths of beekeepers said mites were harming their hives, and with pesticides and other factors still stressing bees, the overall increase is largely the result of constant replenishment of losses, the study showed.
“You create new hives by breaking up your stronger hives, which just makes them weaker,” said Tim May, a beekeeper in Harvard, Illinois and the vice-president of the American Beekeeping Federation based in Atlanta. “We check for mites, we keep our bees well-fed, we communicate with farmers so they don't spray pesticides when our hives are vulnerable. I don't know what else we can do.”

Environmental groups have expressed alarm over the 90 percent decline during the past two decades in the population of pollinators, from wild bees to Monarch butterflies. Some point to a class of pesticides called neonicotinoids as a possible cause, a link rejected by Bayer AG and other manufacturers.
In the USDA study, beekeepers who owned at least five colonies, or hives, reported the most losses from the varroa mite, a parasite that lives only in beehives and survives by sucking insect blood. The scourge, present in the U.S. since 1987, was reported in 42 percent of commercial hives between April and June this year, according to the USDA. That's down from 53 percent in the same period one year earlier.
Among other factors, beekeepers said 13 percent of colonies in the second quarter of this year were stressed by pesticides, 12 percent by mites and pests other than varroa and 4.3 by diseases. Bad weather, starvation, insufficient forage and other reasons were listed as problems with 6.6 percent of hives.
Colony Collapse
Colony Collapse, while not a main cause of loss, has perplexed scientists for more than a decade since the phenomenon of bees seemingly spontaneously fleeing their hives and not returning was first identified in the U.S.
As beekeepers have worked to improve hive conditions, the syndrome has waned as a concern, said May Berenbaum, head of the entomology department at the University of Illinois and a winner of the National Medal of Science.
“It's been more of a blip in the history of beekeeping,” she said in an interview. On the other hand, “it's staggering that half of America's bees have mites,” she said. “Colony Collapse Disorder has been vastly overshadowed by diseases, recognizable parasites and diagnosable physiological problems.”
In the survey, a hive loss was attributed to colony collapse if varroa or other mites were ruled out as a cause; few dead bees were found in a hive, a sign that they fled; a queen bee and food reserves were both seemingly normal pre-collapse; and food reserves were left alone after fleeing.
May said his losses are highly variable depending on where his hives are located and may be affected by farmers improperly spraying pesticides. “It's really tricky” to tease out factors behind bee deaths, he said. “Maybe it's pesticides, maybe it's not. But when I eliminate everything else, it's a distinct possibility.”
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency is reviewing neonicotinoids, proposing bans on spraying them and several dozen other pesticides in fields where bees have been brought in to pollinate a crop. A pair of scientific studies in Science last month linked neonicotinoids to poor reproduction and shorter lifespans in European and Canadian bees. The research was funded in part by Bayer CropScience and Syngenta AG, the makers of imidacloprid, clothianidin and thiamethoxam.
“There are numerous things impacting bee health,” Syngenta Chief Executive Officer Erik Fyrwald said in an interview in Brussels last month. “One of the very minor elements there are pesticides. So it's amazing to us that the discussion is, as a whole, about pesticides. Not only pesticides, just specifically neonics.”

The colony of 70 carpenter ants flown aboard the space shuttle Challenger last June died of dehydration before they ever left the Earth, the high school students who built the ant colony experiment said today.
"It is our opinion after exhaustive tests that the ants died of rapid dehydration when their cannister was purged twice with dry air long before liftoff," Tasha Freeman, a student at Camden High School, said at a news conference. "We have concluded that the relative humidity of the air in the container after the second purge was one-tenth of 1 percent, drier than the driest desert on Earth."
Students at Camden and Woodrow Wilson high schools, who devised the experiment that was paid for by RCA Corp., said the ants probably died no more than 48 hours after they were placed aboard Challenger seven weeks before liftoff. It was in those first 48 hours that the experiment was purged with "commercial dry air" to cleanse the ant farm.
In a report they released today, the students said a microscopic examination of 100 sugar cubes placed inside the farm to feed the ants showed only 112 tiny bites in the cubes, suggesting that the ants had almost no time to eat.
"If the ants had been alive any longer than a few days those sugar cubes would have far more and far bigger bites in them," said Luis Sepulveda, a student at Woodrow Wilson High School. "And if they had lived at all on their trip in space, the sugar would have been just about consumed when they returned to Earth."
Camden High School's Freeman said the students worked with biologists at Temple University in Philadelphia and their own science teachers to devise ways of testing four theories of why the ants died.
One theory was that the ants suffocated in space when the sphagnum moss in which they lived absorbed oxygen and released carbon dioxide whenever the ants were in the dark because of photosynthesis.
A second theory was that the soil in the ant colony contained some kind of poison.
Analysis showed that the soil was clean and nontoxic.
Another theory was that bacteria or fungus could have been introduced by the students when they placed the moss, the soil and the wood that the moss grew on in the ant farm. An exhaustive test showed that the only bacteria present in the ant farm at the end of the flight through space was ordinary bacillus, which is not toxic to any living thing.
Nicholas Timpanelli, the science teacher at Camden High School who supervised the student experiment for the last five years, said he would like to see the experiment repeated with modifications.
Timpanelli said a device could be built into the ant farm that would introduce a spray of moisture after the farm was purged.
"It would be like having a humidifier inside the ant farm," Timpanelli said. "We think that's all it would take."
Timpanelli said he is proud of the almost 300 students at the two inner-city high schools who devised the experiment and analyzed why the ants died.
He said that they "put in a lot of extra work, although most of them had no idea of how to go about it when they began this project."
Since the ant autopsies suggest that the blame for the ants' death should fall on NASA, the space agency has indicated that it may allow the students to repeat the experiment. RCA has said it will put up another $10,000 to reserve space aboard some future shuttle flight so the students can get a second chance to discover how carpenter ants survive a week of weightlessness in Earth orbit.
The end of the sponsorship
Despite the Orange Bird's massive setback in the late 1970s in 1981, the Florida Citrus Commission elected to still renew its contract with Walt Disney World for another five years, extending its sponsorship of both the Sunshine Tree Terrance and the Tropical Serenade attraction. Although the aforementioned departure of Anita Bryant effectively killed the Orange Bird on TV, he was still very present both in Walt Disney World (both behind the counter at the Sunshine Tree Terrace and as a walk around character) and at local citrus shops around the state.
However, when the contract between the Florida Citrus Commission and Walt Disney World came up for renewal again in 1986, the Florida Citrus Commission changed its mind and opted not to renew their contract, for reasons that are still unknown. The end of the official sponsorship resulted in the expulsion of the Orange Bird from the Magic Kingdom with the walk-around character disappearing overnight and the little Orange Bird figure that had long served as the icon for the Sunshine Tree Terrace vanishing in the mid-90s during a routine refurbishment.
Though the Orange Bird continued to have a life outside of Walt Disney World, as citrus stands around Florida became more of a rarity (and the connection with Walt Disney World lost), this happy little icon slowly vanished from local Florida culture, with many only vaguely recalling its former glory.
Fortunately however, this was not the end of the story for this happy little bird...
The Orange Bird reappears in…Tokyo?
Though the Orange Bird was conceived as a character to help represent Florida's citrus industry, after his disappearance following the 1986 dissolution of the contract with the Florida Citrus Commission, the next place the Orange Bird would find himself would be Tokyo Disneyland in the early 2000s.
Seemingly without any prompting, in 2004 the Orange Bird made his first international appearance as part of Tokyo Disneyland's "Orange Day" celebrations. Locals fell hard for the cute little character, with merchandise of all shapes and sizes featuring the Orange Bird literally flying off store shelves (pun intended). Even though its doubtful that many guests at Tokyo Disneyland (if any at all) remembered the Orange Bird from the early days of Walt Disney World, the character's immediate popularity in Japan helped put this little guy on the path to stage one of the biggest comebacks in Disney history...
The return of the Orange Bird to Walt Disney World
Due to a combination of local nostalgia and the character's growing popularity overseas, the Orange Bird began making a soft return to Walt Disney World in 2009. During this year, a number of short-run limited edition merchandise items featuring the park's former mascot were created as a way to "test the waters" and see if this little character still had appeal in his home market.
However, response to these items was huge, with many of the limited-run items selling out as soon as they hit shelves. Clearly, Walt Disney World was ready for the return of its original mascot, and the timing seemed just about right as the Orange Bird was just about to celebrate his 40th birthday
Though merchandise continued to trickle into Walt Disney World for the next few years, the Orange Bird's return didn't truly kick into high gear until 2012, when the iconic Orange Bird figure finally returned to his rightful place behind the counter of the Sunshine Tree Terrace, much to the delight of longtime fans.
It addition to resuming his usual post, the Orange Bird even got a bit of an upgrade as he also got a new plum spot on the Sunshine Tree Terrace signage as well and his own line of drink cups
Orange Bird Mania returns
Though the Orange Bird was certainly popular in the 1970s (and the 1980s, albeit to a lesser extent), this little mascot has enjoyed quite the second life at Walt Disney World since his full return in 2015, and can be found in plenty of areas beyond the Sunshine Tree Terrace. In fact, in recent weeks a new poster featuring the Orange Bird has moved into the front of the Magic Kingdom park, reminding guests to enjoy a refreshing Citrus Swirl ice cream treat!
However, even though the Orange Bird has returned to his rightful home in Adventureland, the area where this returning mascot has really made the biggest impact is, unsurprisingly, in merchandise. Though the Orange Bird can only be found in the Magic Kingdom, you can find Orange Bird goodies all over Walt Disney World, with pins, ear hats, dishes, glasses, t-shirts and even plushes featuring this formerly "lost" mascot filling stores at all four theme parks and even around the Downtown Disney shopping district. Though the Orange Bird had a nearly two-decade absence from Walt Disney World, it's clear that this icon is back, and though he's still quite tiny, his influence is bigger than ever.
Even though the Florida Citrus Commission never returned to sponsor any part of Walt Disney World, the legacy of the character that was born out of the partnership between these two entities has endured longer than either probably ever imagined it ever would.
While the tale of the Orange Bird does have quite a few twists and turns, his story is far from over, and we can't wait to see what's next for this quiet little bird who doesn't make a peep, but can think orange thoughts!

This story was originally published in the Guardian and is reproduced here as part of the Climate Desk initiative. The video was produced by Climate Desk's Tim McDonnell.
The United Nations climate chief has urged global financial institutions to triple their investments in clean energy to reach the $1 trillion a year mark that would help avert a climate catastrophe.
In an interview with the Guardian, the UN's Christiana Figueres urged institutions to begin building the foundations of a clean-energy economy by scaling up their investments.
Global investment in clean technologies is running at about $300 billion a year—but that is nowhere where it needs to be, Figueres said.
“From where we are to where we need to be, we need to triple, and we need to do that—over the next 5 to 10 years would be best—but certainly by 2030,” she said.
The International Energy Agency said four years ago it would take $1 trillion a year in new infrastructure projects by 2030 to make the shift from a coal– and oil-based economy to the cleaner fuels and technologies that would help keep warming below the dangerous threshold of 3.6 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit).
But investment has lagged far behind. “What we need to have invested in the energy sector and in the green infrastructure in order to make the transformation that we need in order to stay within 2C is $1 trillion a year, and we are way, way behind that,” Figueres said.
Figueres and leading Wall Street figures will urge global investors to step up their clean-energy investments at a meeting at the United Nations on Wednesday organized by the Ceres investment network.
The biggest investors—pension funds, insurance companies, foundations, and investment managers—control about $76 trillion in assets, according to OECD figures.
But by Figueres' estimate, those institutional investors were committing less than 2 percent of the funds under their control to clean-energy infrastructure—compared to the 10 percent or 15 percent that was still going into coal and oil.
“Last year, we had $300 billion, and in the same year we had double that amount invested in exploration and mining in fossil fuels. So you can see that the ratio is not where it needs to be. We need to be at the opposite ratio.”
The UN climate official said she hoped to make her case by showing the opportunities in clean-tech investment—but also the financial risks of sticking with coal and oil.
The UN's climate panel, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, said for the first time in its blockbuster climate report last September that there was a finite amount of carbon that could be burnt to stay within 2 degrees Celsius of warming.
About half of that carbon budget is already spent—which means much of the remaining coal and oil can not be burned without crossing into dangerous warming.
“There is no doubt that most of the fossil fuel reserves we have worldwide will have to stay in the ground” to avoid warming beyond 2C, Figueres said.
“Two-thirds of the fossil fuels we have will have to stay in the ground.”
She argued those realities would eventually erode the value of oil and coal holdings. Climate experts have already taken to referring to such carbon stores as “stranded assets.”
“There is study after study coming out saying, ‘Beware: We are invested in assets that are already and will soon be losing value,” she said.
Diplomats hope this week's investor summit will energize efforts to reach a global emissions-cutting deal in 2015.
The gathering is the first of a number of big climate-themed gatherings set for 2014, culminating with an invitation to world leaders by the UN secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, to a summit in September to try to get the outlines of that deal in place.
In Washington, meanwhile, President Barack Obama is expected to finalize new limits on greenhouse gas emissions from power plants—a critical step if the United States is to reach its pledge to cut greenhouse gas emissions 17 percent by 2020.
But global investment is still not keeping place. Bloomberg New Energy Finance put global investment in clean technology at just $281 billion in 2012—and the figures for 2013, due for release at the investor summit on Wednesday, are expected to fall even lower.
That would mean a quadrupling of clean tech investment—instead of the tripling in investment that Figueres estimates.
“Cost-competitive renewable technologies and attractive investment opportunities exist right now, but we're still not seeing clean-energy deployment at the scale we need to put a dent in climate change,” said Mindy Lubber, the president of Ceres.
“We need to find a way to get more institutional investor capital into this space.”

ARLINGTON, Va. (Aug. 26, 2013) -- The National Guard and Reserves should remain strong operational forces, senior leaders of the seven reserve components said recently.
"We need to continue to engage in the operational missions of our services," Gen. Frank Grass, chief of the National Guard Bureau and a member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said at a reserve chiefs panel discussion at the Reserve Officers Association 2013 National Security Symposium.
"We have to look like the Army and the Air Force, and we have to have missions that get us into the fight so we can continue to grow leaders that can be ready at a moment's notice anywhere in the world," Grass said.
Marine Lt. Gen. Richard Mills, commander, Marine Forces Reserve, said active duty and Reserve forces should train, operate and deploy together to maintain readiness.
The chiefs discussed the appropriate mix of active duty and reserve-component forces as the Defense Department faces cuts in money because of an ongoing sequester. Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel also has ordered a Strategic choice and Management Review -- the SCMR, dubbed the "skimmer" in policy circles -- to study the size of the force.
And defense leaders are shaping the Components Program Objective Memorandum, or POM, for the 2015 fiscal year. The final product of the Defense Department programming process, the POM outlines the military departments' resource allocation decisions, which in turn are based on Strategic Planning Guidance and Joint Programming Guidance, according to Pentagon librarians.
"All the key decisions about the size of our military, the weapons, the active-component/ reserve-component mix, these things are being decided," explained retired Marine Maj. Gen. Arnold Punaro, who facilitated the discussion. "They're being decided in a world of increasing threats and decreasing resources."
Among options under consideration: a smaller, well-equipped, well-trained force.
If active-duty force reductions are associated with increased risk, then Maj. Gen. Marcia Anderson, representing the Army Reserve on behalf of its chief, suggested one solution lies in the Reserve components.
"By increasing your capabilities within the Reserve components, you mitigate that risk significantly," Anderson said.
"Why pay for something every day, 24/7, when you can put it in the Reserve component and have it only when you need it?" said Air Force Lt. Gen. James Jackson, chief of the Air Force Reserve.
"One of the best things the Army ever did was adopt the ARFORGEN model," Grass said, as the panelists discussed a solution that might look like a combination of varying stages of readiness within the reserve components rather than an entirely operational reserve.
The Army Force Generation model, referred to as ARFORGEN, envisions all Army units in one of three pools: Reset, Ready or Available.
"Everyone is in a cycle," Grass said. "People do need a break."
"There needs to be room in the Reserves for people who can only give 38 days a year," said Navy Vice Adm. Robin Braun, chief of the Navy Reserve.
"You're going to have some people who are going to have to be ready to go at a moment's notice," Anderson said.
An operational Reserve force helps to ensure that active duty units get the so-called dwell time -- time home in garrison -- to reset, Mills said.
And with a smaller active duty force, he said, "You've got to have a Reserve that's ready, enabled and trained to go out the door fairly quickly."
Jackson said he doesn't even like the terms "operational" and "strategic" when applied to the reserves.
"There's too much baggage with them," he said, preferring to think of reserve forces as a mixture of operational capacity, surge capacity and strategic depth.
"This is not and should not be an 'us versus them,'" Punaro said, referring to the active duty and Reserve components. "This should be a hand-in-glove situation. We're all in this together. ... The Guard and Reserves bring tremendous capacity to the active components. ... This capacity is not at their expense."
Cuts should be made strategically rather than across-the-board, Reserve leaders said.
"This is a perfect time to look to see what mission areas we can move into the Reserve components and then, as we draw down on the active component side, take advantage of those great Sailors who are leaving the active component and move them into the Reserve component," Braun said. "Let's keep them in a part-time status and take advantage of all that great training and experience that they've had over the past five or 10 years."
Retaining good active duty service members by welcoming them into the Guard and Reserves makes financial sense, Reserve leaders said.
"If you keep a citizen-Airman for life, whether in the Guard or Reserve, you retain that half-a-million-dollar investment for the first six or seven years of that training," Jackson said. "Why throw that all away?"
But, Jackson added, "You can't bring them in if you don't have the positions to do it."
"We have the best military and the best Reserve components we have ever had in our history," Grass said. "These young men and women expect to deploy. They joined since 9/11. They know what they're getting into. They want predictability, as much as possible, but they do want an opportunity to deploy."
And they have proven themselves since Sept. 11, 2001, said Mills, who came to his present assignment from the active-duty side.
"I come to the Reserve components with the greatest respect because of what I saw on the battlefield, both in Iraq and Afghanistan," he said. "I was privileged to have Reserve forces -- both organic units and individual augmentees -- under me in Afghanistan, and they just did a magnificent, magnificent job."
This past year was marked by relentless media attacks and fake and misleading headlines about President Donald Trump. But when the media couldn't get enough dirt on Trump in 2017, they turned their attention on first lady Melania.
Melania lives a relatively quiet life in the White House compared to previous first ladies, but whenever she stepped out in public, the media was champing at the bit for a scandal.
We've compiled a list of some of the most ridiculous media attacks on Melania since her husband took office.
Journos ‘Baffled' By Melania Wearing High Heels To Texas
Media outlets accused Melania of being pretentious when she wore a pair of stilettos while boarding a plane to Texas. Melania and her husband were visiting areas ravaged by Hurricane Harvey, and critics said her shoes showed she was ill-prepared and insensitive to the suffering of Texans.
However, when Melania de-boarded in Texas, she was rocking a pair of Converse sneakers and a “FLOTUS” hat, clearly ready to get to work.
Media Mocks ‘Horror Show' Christmas Decorations
Melania turned into a Christmas snow queen when she decorated the White House for the holiday season, and some of the pictures are simply stunning. Nonetheless, a number of media outlets called the set-up “horrific,” a “nightmare before Christmas,” and “creepy.”
Melania was clearly going for an ethereal, magical look as opposed to a kitschy red-and-green theme, but the media mocked her for daring to be different.
Newsweek: Melania Kills Historic White House Tree
A misleading Newsweek headline suggested that Melania was “ordering” the removal of an historic Jackson magnolia at the White House for no apparent reason.
“Melania Trump orders removal of the near-200-year-old tree from the White House,” Newsweek claimed.
However, once readers clicked into the article they discovered that the 200-year-old tree was on its last leg and could fall and seriously injure someone at any moment. After exhausting all other options, tree specialists recommended the tree be removed. Melania even asked that the wood from the tree be preserved, and a new Jackson magnolia is set to be planted in the old tree's place.
Melania's Slovakian Accent Becomes Fodder For Comedians
Comedians, many of whom claim to be pro-immigration, used Melania's Slovakian accent as fodder for skits and jokes about the first lady. Chelsea Handler, a notable Trump critic, said she would never have Melania on her Netflix show because she can “barely speak English.”
Victoria's Secret model Gigi Hadid did an embarrassing impersonation of Melania and her accent at the American Music Awards, and eventually had to apologize after backlash.
WATCH:
Melania speaks five languages — her native Slovene, English, French, Serbian and German.
Melania's High Heels Are ‘Horrifying'
If you thought the trip to Texas would be the only criticism of Melania's stilettos, think again. Newsweek didn't need there to be a flood or a hurricane to trash Melania's shoe choices.
In an August article, a Newsweek writer claimed that Melania's decision to constantly wear high heels is both “horrifying” and reminiscent of 17th century Italian prostitutes. Melania wears the shoes, the author opined, to make herself pleasing to men and to give her an air of exclusivity.
With or without feminist approval, I think we all can agree that Melania looks fantastic.
Melania Accused of Cultural Appropriation In China
Elite Daily suggested that Melania may have been committing cultural appropriation with her choice of dress at a Chinese state dinner. Melania opted for a Gucci ensemble with flowers and birds, a piece that writer Lisa Dunn considered “heavy-handed” and “more caricature than genuine.”
Dunn contrasted Melania's choice with a boring black mermaid gown that Michelle Obama wore at the state dinner one year prior.
Anti-Bullying Initiative Criticized Over Her Husband's Tweets
First ladies often pick an initiative to focus on during their time in the White House. Laura Bush's was improving childhood literacy, Michelle Obama's was lowering childhood obesity, and Melania's is ending child cyberbullying.
Journalists and media outlets quickly accused Melania of hypocrisy because her husband routinely attacks people on his Twitter account.
Her response?
“As the first lady has stated publicly in the past, when her husband gets attacked, he will punch back 10 times harder,” Melania's spokesperson said.
Pricey Gardening Outfit Triggers Critics
As if the high heels weren't enough, the media went after Melania when she appeared in Michelle Obama's White House vegetable garden in an expensive outfit. Melania wore a $1,380 Balmain plaid shirt, jeans, red gloves, and Converse sneakers.
“It's a version of opulence that repulses many, especially progressives,” Business Insider said.
Melania is a former model who cares deeply about fashion and has the money to afford designer clothing, so we're not quite sure what the big deal is.
Slut-Shaming Is Cool If You're A Trump, Apparently
New York Times reporter Jacob Bernstein allegedly called Melania a “hooker” because of her modeling career, which included nude photoshoots. Model Emily Ratajkowski called out Bernstein for his “sexist” attacks on Melania, but other feminists weren't willing to jump to Melania's defense.
Slate copy editor Heather Schwedel argued that Bernstein's comments were justifiable because 1. they occurred at a private event and 2. Melania forfeited any right to be treated decently when she married Donald Trump.
Other media outlets used Melania's nude photos to try and embarrass the first family, even though leftists encourage the idea that the female body is nothing to be ashamed of.
While the media has gone out of their way to diminish and mock Melania, her approval ratings show that she is appealing to the American people. According to a recent Gallup poll, Melania has a 54 percent approval rating, up 17 points from January.

Rep. Alan Grayson (D-FL) spoke for the nation when he declared that John Boehner is useless, and he has got to go.
Video:
After discussing how appalled the American people are with the tea party, Rep. Grayson said that the Republican Party is on the way out,
I think it's already clear to people that the Republican Party is on its way out. The Republican Party is going to go the way of the Whig Party. The way the Whig Party disappeared in the 1830s in America, and the reason is simple. They simply won't do anything useful for ordinary people. Whether the issue is jobs, or housing, or healthcare, or transportation, whatever the issue might be, they've got nothing, and it's not our fault, but they've got nothing. They simply want to bring about the end of days as soon as possible. That is the ultimate tea party Republican desire, bringing about the end of days. The Republican Party's become the largest suicide pact in history, and I hope that they don't take us with them. ….. Listen, Boehner has to go. Boehner dragged this country with his tea party allies through the mud for two weeks and a half completely unnecessarily. There was no purpose to this whatsoever. The bill we voted on late last night was the same bill that we could have voted on two weeks ago, two months ago, two years ago. And the fact is that John Boehner's become a short order cook for the far right wing. Would you like some French fries or cheese with that? That's what he does. He takes whatever they want, and lays it out there as if that's the right thing to do.
Rep. Grayson argued that Boehner's status as the errand boy for the tea party House Republicans has made him completely useless, so he has to go. In the same interview, Grayson also claimed that the tea party is about as popular as the KKK, and that Democrats must remain vigilant because tea partiers are going to continue to try to destroy the country by wrecking the economy.
Grayson is correct. Boehner has to go, but the problem is that there is no one that Republican Party could replace him with who wouldn't face the same pressures. This is why the only solution is for voters to replace John Boehner and the Republican House majority with Nancy Pelosi and a new Democratic House in 2o14.
Alan Grayson loves his fiery rhetoric, but beneath the headline making quips was a very profound point. Unless Speaker Boehner reinvents himself, he is completely useless to the country. When push came to shove during the latest House Republican caused economic crisis, Mitch McConnell, Harry Reid, and Nancy Pelosi did their jobs. The weak link that nearly broke the chain, and the nation's economy, was John Boehner.
More than anything else, the biggest lesson learned is that John Boehner has to go.

AGRA: While right wing Hindu activists have been criticising cinestar Kamal Haasan for his controversial remarks, perceived against the community, a Muslim youth leader from Aligarh has also joined the bandwagon and announced a reward of Rs 25,000 for anyone who blackens his face.Dubbing Kamal Haasan an “anti-national”, who was trying to create a wedge between Hindus and Muslims, Mohd Aamir Rashid president of Muslim Youths Association in Aligarh said that he would pay the reward to anyone who blackens his face.Talking to TOI, Rashid said that if Hindus turn “extremists” then no other community in the country would be safe. He said anyone trying to create differences between two communities by such remarks needed to be silenced by cutting his “tongue” too.He made it explicit that Kamal Haasan wanted to enter politics by making such “strong and provocative” statements.In his column in a Tamil magazine that hit the stands on Thursday, the 62-year-old actor without mentioning any names had alleged that right-wing outfits had “changed course”.He had said, “Earlier such Hindu right-wingers, without indulging in violence against those belonging to other religions, made the latter indulge in violence through their arguments and counterarguments”. However, since “this old conspiracy” had begun to fail, the groups are indulging in violence, he wrote. “Extremism is in no way a (mark of) success or growth for those who call themselves Hindus,” wrote the Tamil film icon.
Charles Oliveira's four-fight winning streak was snapped on Sunday night due to an injury at the UFC Fight Night 74 main event in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, and it wasn't the first time the Brazilian suffered that type of injury.
"do Bronx", who got injured after shooting for a takedown against Max Holloway a minute and a half into the opening round, spoke to MMAFighting.com on Monday morning and explained he had a neck injury going into the fight.
"I injured my neck in training, but did physical therapy and thought everything was fine," Oliveira told MMAFighting.com, "but when I fell against the cage everything went numb, I couldn't feel my body."
The UFC featherweight was rushed to the hospital right after the fight, and has yet to be released by the doctors. "I'm still doing a lot of exams here at the hospital," he said.
Following a frustrating loss, "do Bronx" hopes the UFC books a rematch against Holloway, who has now won seven in a row in the featherweight division.
"I trained really hard for this fight," Oliveira said. "I would like a rematch because there was no fight. I got injured literally the first time I attacked."
Update: While there are multiple reports of an esophagus tear, Oliveira says he doesn't know yet.
For the Gujarat Congress MLAs holed up in the Bengaluru resort to deter defection, home-food is a major missing point.
According to a report published in The Hindustan Times, the 44 legislators have expressed a discontent over the South-Indian food served to them in their temporary abode prompting the party high command in state to provide them with a Gujarati chef.
"All the arrangements are great. But there is bound to be a difference in cuisine," one of the legislator told the newspaper pointing out how non-spicy Gujaratis who depend more on roti, dal and kadhi (chappatti, lentils and curry) are the biggest sufferers in the land of rice.
A typical Gujarati breakfast would have included ‘bhakhri' and ‘thepla'. But here, att ‘Eagleton - The Golf Village', some 40km outside the state capital Bengaluru, it is idli and dosa while the menu for lunch mostly included rice or ragi balls.
DK Shivakumar, the power minister in Karnataka's Congress government, said a Gujarati chef will be made available for the MLAs soon, the paper reported.
Congress had brought its 44 legislators at the resort on Saturday, to fend off "poaching" attempts by the BJP ahead of the August 8 Rajya Sabha polls in Gujarat.
Six of the 57 Congress MLAs in Gujarat, from where senior party leader Ahmed Patel is contesting for the Rajya Sabha, have resigned from the party in the last few days with three joining the BJP on Friday.

Among teachers unions and their allies, an article of faith is that vouchers to allow attendance at private schools do nothing for students. All the more reason to look at two new studies tracking student performance in two states with voucher programs—Indiana and Louisiana.
Start with Louisiana. Today 7,100 students—nearly 90% of them African American—attend private or religious schools of their parents' choice thanks to a statewide program that includes vouchers for private schools. In February 2016, Jonathan Mills of Tulane and Patrick Wolf of the University of Arkansas released a study that found declines in English and math after two years at a private school using a voucher.
But that wasn't the end of the story. Messrs. Mills and Wolf expanded their study to include performance after three years, and when they did the results flipped. Their new study shows that, by the end of the third year, the differences between voucher students and those in public schools had been erased.
Meanwhile, researchers Mark Berends and R. Joseph Waddington focused on Indiana's statewide voucher program that now serves more than 34,000 students. The study found that students using vouchers had declines in math and English for the first two years after leaving public school. But the longer these voucher kids stuck around in their new schools, the better they did—surpassing their public school peers in English after four years.
These studies are important in rebutting what has been an especially aggressive campaign this year against vouchers by unions and liberal journalists. With President Trump and Education Secretary Betsy DeVos supporting school choice including vouchers, the campaign is on to discredit them with or without persuasive evidence.
Student improvement after the first two years at a new school is also consistent with common sense. Parents and teachers know that changing schools can be a big adjustment for children, and private schools typically have different cultural mores and teaching habits. Most parents don't look for private schools if their children are prospering in their current school.
It's also a mistake to judge a voucher program entirely on standardized tests. There are many other indicators—from personal safety, to discipline, graduation rates and speciality curricula. The idea behind state performance tests is to give parents and taxpayers a way to judge how well schools are teaching and hold them accountable.
But education choice—whether in charters or vouchers—comes with the built-in accountability that they must compete to attract students, and parents can withdraw their children if they are unhappy. Even if test scores aren't notably different, why should the default be keeping kids trapped in public schools rather than letting parents make the choice?
These new studies should give a boost to those who believe accountability comes from parents who know better than a distant education bureaucracy what schools best work for their children.

The Los Angeles Dodgers have made waves in the international market, with scouting director Logan White procuring a bounty of talent for the organization. Thus far, Yasiel Puig has grabbed the lion's share of the headlines, but the most compelling/intriguing international acquisition by the Dodgers camp may have been Julio Urias, the pitcher whom they plucked out of Mexico in August of 2012, just days after he turned 16 years old.
One would expect the development of a teenager to take a slow pace, with little more than an appearance in short-season rookie ball during his first season. The Dodgers kept Urias in extended spring training into late May, but then they gave him an extremely aggressive assignment to full-season ball, where he joined the Great Lakes Loons as the youngest player in the Midwest League.
Level GS IP ERA K % BB % H % HR % A 18 54.3 2.48 31.8% 7.6% 20.9% 2.4%
The Dodgers were careful with the left-handed prodigy, adhering to strict limits to his innings as well as his pitch counts. He never faced more than 20 batters in a game, and he pitched enough innings to qualify for a victory in only three of his outings (he went 2-0 on the season). Urias' longest start was a dominant six-inning performance on July 3, after which the Dodgers tightened the reins on his workload; he pitched two frames or fewer in each of his next seven games, despite starting each contest. He was allowed to go a bit deeper near the end of the season, but even his longest start of the second half was capped at four innings, and Urias was shut down for the year on August 29th while his Great Lakes teammates advanced to the playoffs.
Urias' season was a resounding success, from the stingy run prevention to the eye-popping strikeout rate. Every one of his home starts is viewable via MiLB.tv, affording a tremendous opportunity to witness the legend of Uri's gold. I sofa-scouted a number of his outings, going from his professional debut to his final pitch of the year, and the wunderkind left quite an impression.
May 26th vs. Dayton
Urias made his pro debut against a lineup that was stacked with hitters who were anywhere from three to eight years his senior, yet the left-hander was far from overmatched. On the contrary, Urias utilized a low-90s fastball, deep-fading changeup, and slurvy breaking ball to dominate the Dayton Dragons for three innings. He showed off his full arsenal in the first inning en route to a trio of K's, striking out the side in an effort that loudly announced his presence on the prospect map.
Urias located his fastball high and low and inside and outside, and though he had the occasional missed target, he was effective overall in hitting quadrants of the strike zone. He also generated plenty of empty swings within the zone with his fastball, a trait made all the more impressive by the likely growth of his heater as Urias develops.
Urias surrendered his first hit leading off the second inning, putting him into the stretch. Stretch mechanics are less of a concern for southpaws than they are for right-handers, given the differences in strategy with respect to holding runners close, though some lefties will still mess with their deliveries with men on base. Urias retained his normal leg-kick, though he did ramp up the momentum a touch, and it took him a few pitches to find the timing of his stretch delivery. He allowed another single, but by the middle of the inning he had found his release point on the curveball, leading to a vicious K versus Robert Ramirez.
Urias continued to employ more secondaries as the game progressed, showing a willingness to throw any pitch in virtually any count. He spun plenty of first-pitch breaking balls, and was just as likely to reach back for heat with two strikes as he was to become overly reliant on off-speed pitches with movement. The strategy continued to wreak havoc on batter timing, particularly as Urias honed his breaker. The only black mark on an otherwise tremendous outing was a third-inning walk of Zach Vincej, though it took a battle of fouls and just-misses for Vincej to earn the free pass. Urias ended the day with yet another strikeout, getting Joe Terry for the second time of the game, going back to the high heat for the final act of his debut performance.
June 11th vs. West Michigan
Urias had his toughest game of the year on June 11, an outing that included three earned runs in 2.7 innings and a modest pair of strikeouts. All four of the hits surrendered went for extra bases, including the first two homers of his pro career. The main culprit was a lack of pitch command that resulted in a lot of hitter's counts, and his secondary pitches lacked the bite that they'd had in previous outings. Urias fell into the common trap of over-correction, with under-rotated pitches followed immediately by over-rotated deliveries that would miss low and to the glove-side of their targets. He also dealt with a cross-up with his catcher that resulted in the rare two-base penalty on a passed ball.
All of the real damage occurred in the third inning. Urias came out after a 30-minute break due to the seven runs that the Loons offense put up in the bottom of the second, and though the precocious lefty hit 95 mph on the gun with his first pitch of the frame, it was an under-rotated pitch that missed arm-side to right-handed batting Jake Stewart. Urias continued to miss his targets, and Stewart yanked a 2-1 heater that was right in his wheelhouse, blasting the baseball out of the ballpark for the first homer surrendered in Urias' career as a professional.
Urias discovered his curve for a couple of pitches to Austin Schotts, including some of his best offerings of the day, finishing him with a swooping breaker that had the right-handed Schotts paying for the tab without a swing. The celebration was short-lived, and Urias quickly paid for his transgressions. He surrendered a deep triple to Jared Reaves, followed immediately by an opposite-field liner that cleared the wall by Devon Travis, marking the only game of the 2013 season in which he gave up multiple home runs (in this case, two in one inning). After a lengthy conversation on the mound, Urias gave up another extra-base hit to the next batter, a double to Jeff Holm that effectively knocked the 16-year old from the ballgame.
The June 11th game was the roughest outing of his season, and it kicked off a three-start stretch in which Urias gave up eight earned runs over the course of 11.3 innings. By comparison, he surrendered just seven earnies in his other 15 games combined (he gave up zero unearned runs in 2013). Urias would have his revenge, facing the West Michigan White Caps again three weeks later, a game in which he smote his enemy's ruin upon the mountainside.
July 3rd vs. West Michigan
The White Caps witnessed both the best of times and the worst of times for Julio Urias last season. After having their way with him in mid-June, West Michigan found nothing in their favor once the calendar flipped to July. Urias tossed six innings of scoreless baseball, marking his longest outing of his season, and he set a new career-high with eight strikeouts in the game. The White Caps mustered just a pair of hits and no walks against Urias that day, starting with a 1-2-3 first inning that included a plethora of secondary pitches that produced a couple of strikeouts.
The southpaw punched out four of the first five hitters he faced, using everything in his arsenal to earn early-count strikes as well as finish hitters who had no choice but to slump back to the dugout with confused looks on their faces. His pitch sequencing was superb, as he mixed all of his offerings in virtually any count with a game plan that was completely unpredictable. The calls may have been coming from the dugout or from behind the plate, but Urias had everything working to earn the trust of his catcher and his coaches, and he repeatedly shook off signs in order to dial the right number from his arsenal.
The only damage that could be inflicted came with Connor Harrell at the plate, in the rare instance where Urias was unable to hit his spots. Harrell saw five consecutive pitches on the outer half of the dish, four of which were fastballs, and he took advantage of the last one to the tune of a double to the gap in left-center. But Urias quickly regained his composure, and his sequence to the last batter of the inning was devastating. Facing Jake Stewart, the same batter who had taken Urias out of the yard for the first time, Urias painted a curveball on the outer edge for a called strike, followed by a curve on the hands that was yanked foul, and finished with a fastball at the knees for the backwards K.
July 10th vs. Burlington
The Burlington game was the start of the stretch in which Urias' innings were handcuffed, and he faced just three batters in the one-inning assignment. However, two things were notable in the lone inning of work: his first-ever hit-by-pitch, and the lefty's pick-off move.
Urias plunked only one batter all season, and this lone HBP was weak on all levels. Leadoff batter Riley Good made little effort to avoid the pitch, and the baseball barely grazed Good's arm. Despite any frustration that may have been felt by Urias, the 16-year old did not show it, and he quickly reaped his vengeance.
After one delivery to the plate, Urias triggered his lift-and-throw pick-off move. Good was either deceived or running on first movement, and he was nailed at second base after the pair of throws. It may have been my favorite moment of the young lefty's season, as there is perhaps nothing more badass than registering a pick-off immediately following an HBP, literally adding insult to injury for the hitter/runner.
The event was par for the course for Urias in 2013, as he picked off a total of five batters in fewer than 55 innings of work. Two of the picks were of this type, where a runner dashed for second and was caught by the relay throw, and three of them were straight pick-offs when the baserunner couldn't get back to the first-base bag. Urias gave up zero stolen bases last season, and the two runners who attempted thefts on deliveries to the plate were caught by the catcher.
Urias actually has a number of moves, ranging from a slow “show me” throw-over to the more aggressive play that caught Good. His third move is also his best, and was busted out in his final start of the season.
August 28th vs. Dayton
Urias' final game of the season was blanketed by gnats, blurring the game feed and potentially adding some distraction from the batters' point of view. Urias was undeterred, however, blanking the Dragons for four innings with five strikeouts and zero walks. The recently-turned 17-year-old was throwing harder than he had all season, peaking at 97 mph in the first inning, and the fastball featured some extra movement in addition to the added juice. Opposing hitters were late on the heater throughout the four innings that Urias was on the mound, and the flailing swing by Jon Matthews was repeated by his teammates throughout the outing.
The curveball and change were also on target in Urias' final outing, leading to some funny swings from batters as they attempted to adjust to the velocity differential mid-hack.
It was a fitting end to a season of tremendous development from an incredibly advanced athlete. Throughout the season, Urias did things on the mound that are unheard-of for a pitcher his age, from his repeatable delivery to his pitch sequencing and even his techniques for keeping baserunners chained to the bag. The first baserunner of the game was leadoff man Beau Amaral, who was privileged to witness the third type of pick-off move from Urias: a quick step off the rubber with the back foot and a snap-throw to the bag that sent Amaral retreating back to the dugout.
Mechanics Report Card
Balance 55 Momentum 55 Torque 40 Posture 55 Release Distance 50 Repetition 50
For an explanation of the grading system for pitching mechanics, please consult this pair of articles.
When digesting the above report card, please consider that this is a high-school-aged kid being graded with a big-league report card. There are very few teenagers who come equipped with mechanical tools that fall within range of major-league average scores, and the 50s on Urias' report card deserve credit for advanced placement.
His momentum is already above-average, particularly with an initial move that leads with the hip and features a powerful thrust toward the plate. Urias slows things down with his second gear, an element that might aid his repetition as he continues to mature physically, but which also raises the ceiling of his OFP from a prospect standpoint, given that he has plenty of room to improve.
Urias has a very quick arm, but his torque is low on efficiency. Most of his current torque comes from hip rotation and proper timing, but all too often his hips and shoulders fire too closely together. He has room to up the ante of upper-body load while also increasing separation with a healthy delay of trunk rotation, and these elements will likely come into play as he grows into his delivery. He also has a tendency to minimize torque on breaking and off-speed pitches, an element with which he can find better consistency in the future while preserving his velocity spreads.
Urias has solid posture overall, though it can be inconsistent, depending on the day and the pitch. He tends to exaggerate spine-tilt on some breaking balls, which is a relatively common trend among developing pitchers, but his fastball posture flashes plus on his good days. He will also right his posture after release point on occasion, straightening up after the ball leaves his hand, but the grade reflects his posture at the moment of release point. His balance is strong, especially for a player who is still in the thick of physical maturation, and he alternates pitches of plus balance with those that have some extra drop-and-drive and a head that can lag behind the center of mass.
The most stunning grade on Urias' report card is the 50-grade repetition. Developing pitchers just do not have the type of consistency of timing and movement that Urias possesses right now, both game to game and within a single outing. He still has room for improvement, to be sure, but even when the southpaw is off-kilter he rarely misses his release point by much. Like any pitcher his age, Urias faces a mountain of work that has to be done before he can reach his potential, but he has an incredible head-start on his baseball journey, and the advanced nature of his skill-set puts him on an accelerated path to the big leagues.
Thanks to Bandai Namco releasing a PC version of Tekken 7 we have been able to play it in 3D using an Oculus Rift VR headset. Having a tinker with Tridef's software we created a custom profile that brought the fighting action to life. When coupled with a program such as Virtual Desktop or Bigscreen the Tekken 7 3D results are pretty spectacular. Unfortunately our custom profile caused problems with the game's menus and text where our lack of tinkering has meant it's not pleasant on the eyes outside of combat in practice mode, but still, as these two videos demonstrate the depth effect is worthwhile, bringing stages to life. It's likely someone more experienced with creating Tridef profiles or even VorpX will be able to get better results where the text issue is resolved. Until then, you can view these videos on your VR headset via the two mentioned virtual desktop programs or on a smart 3D TV.

The following blog post, unless otherwise noted, was written by a member of Gamasutras community.
The thoughts and opinions expressed are those of the writer and not Gamasutra or its parent company.
While preparing for the 2011 Paris Game AI conference, Alex Champandard asked me if there are any differences between ABL and behavior trees (BTs) at the planning level, which motivated me to dig a bit deeper into this topic. The goal of this post is to distinguish differences between behavior trees and ABL. While I am contrasting ABL with the Behavior Tree architecture described in Alex's chapter in AI Game Programming Wisdom 4, I am aware that there are several flavors of BT implementations so feel free to add feedback or corrections based on any BT variant.
First, some background. ABL (A Behavior Language) was developed by Michael Mateas and used to author the behaviors for the autonomous characters in the interactive drama Façade. ABL is a reactive planning language that builds on the semantics of Hap, which was developed as part of the Oz project at CMU. ABL is currently being used in several projects at the Expressive Intelligence Studio, and I am using ABL to author EISBot, an opponent AI for StarCraft.
To kick off this discussion, I'll be focusing on the differences between the decision cycle processes in ABL and BTs. There are several other topics that can be discussed such as sensors, actuators, and working memory, but I want to discuss planning aspects.
One of the main differences between the decision cycle processes is that ABL runs asynchronously from the main game update, while BTs are updated during an AI tick. Synchronization with the game is achieved through the agent's actuators and sensors. While ABL could be modified to run during an AI tick, the tree may need to be evaluated multiple times per tick, if controlling multiple units. By default, an ABL agent will run at 60 updates per second if no behaviors are available for execution. If behaviors are available for expansion, then additional updates will occur each second.
In ABL, the behavior tree is expanded as needed. An ABL agent is instantiated as a single root behavior, which can subgoal additional behaviors. When a behavior is selected for expansion, its steps (child nodes) are added to the active behavior tree (ABT). Leaf nodes in the ABT are nodes that are available for execution, unless currently executing.
Success-failure propagation is similar between the two techniques. In ABL, if any step in a behavior fails, the entire behavior fails and failure is propagated up the tree. At each node in the ABT, ABL will attempt to run additional behaviors with the same name and input parameters as the failed behavior. If no additional behaviors are available for execution, or all matching behaviors have failed, then failure is propagated to the node that selected the failed behavior for expansion. There are several types of decorators in ABL for handing success and failure in the ABT.
Another difference between ABL and BTs is action scheduling. In ABL, an action begins executing as soon as it is selected by the decision cycle. During action execution, the leaf node executing the action is marked as executing and the decision cycle process continues. Action execution does not stall the decision cycle, and concurrent action execution can be achieved using parallel behaviors. In BT systems, action selection and action execution are decoupled; the BTs determine which actions to perform and a scheduler is responsible determining when to execute the actions.
ABL is a language, while BTs are a data structure. ABL agents are compiled to Java and executed by the ABL runtime, which is written in Java. One of the advantages of this approach is that an ABL agent can include small Java snippets inline in behaviors. The huge disadvantage is that an ABL agent's behaviors cannot be modified during runtime. I've discussed the idea of building an ABL interpreter with Michael Mateas, and we might explore this option in the future.
The semantics of ABT and BTs are different, but there are several similarities. Alex discusses the following node types in the AI Game Programming Wisdom 4 chapter:
Sequence: Expresses a linear sequence of actions or behaviors to perform.
Expresses a linear sequence of actions or behaviors to perform. Selector: Selects a single child to execute.
Selects a single child to execute. Parallel: Expresses a set of actions or behaviors to perform concurrently.
Expresses a set of actions or behaviors to perform concurrently. Decorator: Wraps a node to extend its functionality.
In ABL, all nodes in the ABT are behaviors. A behavior contains a set of steps to perform, which are expanded as nodes on the ABT. Behaviors can be sequential or parallel. In a sequence behavior, the steps are executed in a linear sequence, providing the same functionality as a sequence node. In a parallel behavior, the steps are available for concurrent execution, providing the same functionality as a parallel node.
In ABL, several step types are available:
Act: Specifies a physical action to perform, such as moving an NPC to a location. Acts are mapped to actuators, which perform the execution of the action in the game
Specifies a physical action to perform, such as moving an NPC to a location. Acts are mapped to actuators, which perform the execution of the action in the game Mental act: An atomic piece of arbitrary Java code. Mental acts are often used to update working memory. Mental acts are performed during the decision cycle process and therefore mental acts that take a long time to perform will stall an agent's decision cycle.
An atomic piece of arbitrary Java code. Mental acts are often used to update working memory. Mental acts are performed during the decision cycle process and therefore mental acts that take a long time to perform will stall an agent's decision cycle. Subgoal: A high-level control flow structure for specifying a sub goal to pursue. When a subgoal node is selected for expansion, the goal node is added to the ABT and behaviors with matching names and parameters are selected for expansion. Subgoal provides the same functionality as selector nodes in BTs.

When a subgoal node is selected for expansion, the goal node is added to the ABT and behaviors with matching names and parameters are selected for expansion. Subgoal provides the same functionality as selector nodes in BTs. Spawngoal: Similar to subgoal, but the goal node is added at the ABT root instead of the parent behavior. The spawned goal will be pursued concurrently with the current goal. Subgoal is analogous to spawning a new thread of execution within an ABL agent.

Subgoal is analogous to spawning a new thread of execution within an ABL agent. Fail: A fail step causes a behavior to fail, which will result in the behavior propagating failure up the ABL.
A fail step causes a behavior to fail, which will result in the behavior propagating failure up the ABL. Succeed: Causes a behavior to succeed, which is the default result of a behavior. This is only used in behaviors that would otherwise have 0 steps. (ABL behaviors must have at least 1 step)
Causes a behavior to succeed, which is the default result of a behavior. This is only used in behaviors that would otherwise have 0 steps. (ABL behaviors must have at least 1 step) Wait: A blocking step. A naked wait will result in a behavior that never completes. Waits can also be combined with a success test, which waits for a condition to be true. For example, a behavior may contain two steps, where the first step issues a physical action to move to a location, and the second step is a wait with a success test that suspends the behavior until the NPC has reached the target location.
Steps in ABL can be annotated with modifiers, which provide the functionality of the decorator node in BTs:
Priority: Assigns a priority to a step. If multiple steps on the ABT are available for execution, the step with the highest priority will be selected.
Assigns a priority to a step. If multiple steps on the ABT are available for execution, the step with the highest priority will be selected. Persistent: Causes a step to be retired indefinitely despite success or failure.
Causes a step to be retired indefinitely despite success or failure. Ignore failure: Causes the step to always return success, ignoring failure or success of the step.
Causes the step to always return success, ignoring failure or success of the step. Persistent when succeeds: The step is retried until it fails.
The step is retried until it fails. Persistent when fails: The step is retried until it succeeds.
The step is retried until it succeeds. Effect only: The step is optional and does not need to be executed for the behavior to complete. Effect only steps are used to add decorative behavior to an agent. Effect only behaviors always return success.
In addition to a collection of steps, ABL behaviors can contain several modifiers:
Preconditions: A set of conditions that must evaluate to true for a behavior to be selected for execution.
A set of conditions that must evaluate to true for a behavior to be selected for execution. Context conditions: A set of conditions that must remain true during the duration of a behavior. If a behavior's context conditions evaluate to false during execution, the behavior is immediately aborted and failure is propagated up the tree.
A set of conditions that must remain true during the duration of a behavior. If a behavior's context conditions evaluate to false during execution, the behavior is immediately aborted and failure is propagated up the tree. Specificity: Specifies a priority for behavior selection. When a subgoal node is added to the ABT, behaviors will be selected for expansion from the highest specificity to the lowest specificity.
Specifies a priority for behavior selection. When a subgoal node is added to the ABT, behaviors will be selected for expansion from the highest specificity to the lowest specificity. Success conditions: A set of conditions that will terminate the behavior and return success if evaluated to true during the execution of a behavior.
A set of conditions that will terminate the behavior and return success if evaluated to true during the execution of a behavior. Number needed for success: The number of child steps that need to successfully complete for the behavior to return success. The behavior completes immediately after the number of steps needed for success is met.
That concludes my comparison of the planning aspects and semantics of ABL versus BTs. Further reading:
'I just want to die': Heartbroken mother reveals final messages of 19-year-old college student 'bullied to death' by former schoolmates after starring in amateur porn
Alyssa Funke, who wanted to be an anesthesiologist, made the decision to take part in a porn video for website CastingCouch-X in March
Days after the video was posted online by the site, she was taunted by former schoolmates at Stillwater High in Minnesota
The University of Wisconsin student defended her decision online with the words 'FAMOUS for dayzzzz'
The teen killed herself with a single shotgun blast near her college campus in Wisconsin
She spoke on the phone to her mother only minutes before pulling the trigger and then sent a text after hanging up
Her mother told MailOnline about her heartbreak and how she didn't see the final message before it was too late
The heartbroken mother of a 19-year-old straight-A student who took her own life weeks after filming an amateur porn has revealed their final conversation and spoken out about the vicious bullying her daughter suffered.
Melissa Funke, 36, of Stillwater, Minnesota, spoke to her daughter on April 17 only minutes before she committed suicide. The chemistry student then texted her mother 'I just want to die' in a message tragically she didn't see before it was too late, she told MailOnline.
Alyssa Funke decided to take part in a sex video with a stranger in Las Vegas for website CastingCouch-X, using the name 'Stella Ann,' as a way of covering college expenses, her mother said - but she couldn't deal with the relentless bullying from former high school classmates that it resulted in.
SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO
Bullied: College student Alyssa Funke was mercilessly bullied for appearing in a pornographic video. The 19-year-old Minnesota native, who committed suicide last month,
'She said she was going to take a shower... and that she was upset from all the bullying,' Melissa Funke recalled.
'[But] she is very… she wanted to come off as everything is fine when it is not.'
The teen acted as if life would go on, and put on a strong face for her mother before saying she loved her and hanging up the phone.
It was a familiar feeling for the 19-year-old who had been bullied since starting school for not being from a wealthy family like many of her classmates in the well-heeled town about 26 miles east of Minneapolis.
Only this time she texted 'I just want to die' to her mother after the conversation ended. Tragically Melissa Funke says she was shopping at the time and did not see the message until 20 minutes later.
A brave face: Alyssa Funke always tried to stay strong and act as if everything was normal, her mother says, but that clearly was not the case
Straight-A chemistry student Alyssa Funke, 19, from Miinnesota, took her own life two weeks after she dabbled in amateur porn and was mercilessly taunted for it
She contacted Wisconsin authorities to help find the girl. She was found dead by police at 1.59 p.m. in a car borrowed from a friend.
The bullying had finally beaten her, Alyssa Funke couldn't put on a brave face anymore.
'She had been bullied since she was a small child,' said her mother. '[Because] she didn't have the nice things... toys, a nice car' that her classmates did.
'It was so many people and she had grown so tired of the bullying…the decision she had made was causing unbareable grief.'
Within days of the sex tape's posting online in March, abusive messages flooded her social media accounts. Many from her former schoolmates at Stillwater High, forcing her to delete her Facebook page, her still grieving mother said.
High school students reportedly gathered around tables in the cafeteria to watch Alyssa Funke's sex tape on their cellphones, according to KMSP-TV .
Funke went to Las Vegas for her interview with CastingCouch-X in March where she called herself Stella Ann. She appeared nervous on the tape and talked about her real dreams of becoming an anesthesiologist
During her interview for the amateur porn site in March, Alyssa Funke, who called herself 'Ann' looked nervous and described her college plans and described her childhood as 'pretty much normal'
One called Miss Funke a 'thot', a slang word for prostitute, adding: 'Does her dad know?'
Another message sniped: 'Nothing brings a school together like a porn star who graduated last year.'
But the school denied there was a bullying problem, the mother claims.
Miss Funke fought back - defending herself. She tweeted: 'Pornstar status' and 'FAMOUS for dayzzzzz.'
The last message she posted on Facebook on March 4 read: 'The people that envy & hate you the most, stalk you on social media the most so, hey hi hello how r u doing, these ones for you.'
She wrote a post to her 'future husband' and a vulnerable message about wanting a relationship where you 'never feel unwanted or alone,' but that warmth never came for the distraught teen.
Melissa Funke recalled being 'surprised, [but] wasn't really shocked' when Alyssa told her she had filmed the movie.
'There were tons of videos on there, I didn't know everybody would see mine,' Melissa Funke remembered her daughter saying.
But the bullying never stopped - even after her death. Online trolls have been hounding memorial pages in her honor.
Many of the messages said 'suicide is a sin' and that the girl 'would burn in hell.'
Her devastated family launched The Alyssa Stop Bullying Fund, which has so far raised a meager $165.
On the site, a family message reads: 'On Wednesday April 16, at the young age of 19 Alyssa Funke took her own life. Alyssa like so many other teens was a victim of bully and sadly the bullying lead to her death.'
The teenage college student had a troubled upbringing with her father in jail in Arizona and her mother and a boyfriend arrested for dealing drugs
The local sheriff's office is investigating the teenager's death but does not believe that the messages sent to Miss Funke amount to criminal harassment.
The lack of action has left her mother frustrated.
'Because no one told her to kill herself? There should be huge amounts of people on harassment charges and there aren't [because] town is so image conscious…these kids are not going to have any consequences because they are so concerned about their image,' she continued.
Her other 16-year-old daughter is also being bullied, she claims, and very little is being done to help the teen.
'The world is a cruel place and getting worse all the time.'
'If we lived in a different area, it would have been a lot different.'
Miss Funke's story draws similarities with Duke student Miriam Weeks, 18, who was outed as porn star Belle Knox earlier this year and also sat on the same Vegas couch for CastingCouch-X.
Miss Knox, a women's studies major, made headlines earlier this year when one of her classmates outed her secret life as a porn star to the student body.
Since then, she has defended her decision to enter the adult film world on Piers Morgan Live, The View and other talk shows.
Only, Alyssa Funke's story has a much sadder outcome, and her mother is left to second-guess.
'I wish I would have known how bad she was feeling at that time, I would have had her with me instead of at college.'
Her final moments: Alyssa Funke drove to Big Carnelia Lake and shot herself dead in a borrowed car
SEOUL, KOREA, REPUBLIC OF—U.S. President Donald Trump delivered a sharp warning to North Korean leader Kim Jong-un on Wednesday, telling him the weapons he's acquiring “are not making you safer. They are putting your regime in grave danger.” In a speech delivered hours after he aborted a visit to the heavily fortified Korean demilitarized zone due to bad weather, Trump called on all nations to join forces “to isolate the brutal regime of North Korea — to deny it any form of support, supply, or acceptance.”
U.S. President Donald Trump says he believes he sees a lot of progress on the North Korean issue. Trump also urged North Korea to 'come to the table and make a deal.' He spoke during a news conference with South Korean President Moon Jae-in. (The Associated Press)
“Today, I hope I speak not only for our countries, but for all civilized nations, when I say to the North: Do not underestimate us. And do not try us,” he told South Korean lawmakers. “We will defend our common security, our shared prosperity, and our sacred liberty.” Read the latest news on U.S. President Donald Trump Trump had been scheduled to make the unannounced early morning trip to the DMZ amid heightened tensions with North Korea over its nuclear program.

The Marine One presidential helicopter left Seoul at daybreak and flew most of the way to the DMZ but was forced to turn back just five minutes out due to poor weather conditions. Reporters travelling in a separate helicopter as part of the president's envoy saw fog through the windows, and weather reports from near the heavily fortified border showed misting conditions and visibility below one mile. Pilots, officials said, could not see the other helicopters in the air. White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said the president was disappointed he couldn't make the trip. “I think he's pretty frustrated,” she told reporters. “It was obviously something he wanted to do.” Before he left for Asia, a White House official had ruled out a DMZ visit for Trump, claiming the president didn't have time on his schedule and that DMZ visits have become a little cliché. But Sanders said the visit had been planned well before Trump's departure for Asia. The trip was kept secret for security reasons, she said. Read more:

Donald Trump stands with Japan, denounces North Korean aggression Trump had been scheduled to make the visit with South Korean President Moon Jae-in, who travelled separately and landed about a 20-minute drive from the DMZ. Sanders said the military and the U.S. Secret Service had deemed that landing would not be safe, and Trump deferred to them. After returning to Seoul, administration officials had hoped they might be able to wait out the bad weather and make a second landing attempt. At the U.S. Army's Yongsan Garrison landing zone, White House Chief of Staff John Kelly and Sanders frequently glanced up at the clouds to see if the sky was clearing. But time would not allow it. The aborted visit came hours before Trump addressed the South Korean National Assembly before closing out his two-day visit to the nation and heading to his next stop, Beijing.

Visiting the border that has separated the North and South for 64 years has become something of a ritual for U.S. presidents trying to demonstrate their resolve against North Korea's ever-escalating aggression. Every American president since Ronald Reagan, save for George H.W. Bush, has made the trip, peering across the barren north through binoculars, hearing broadcast propaganda and reaffirming their commitment to standing with the South. The attempted visit was scheduled for a day after Trump made a striking shift in tone for a president, who for months has issued increasingly dire threats to answer any hostile North Korean action with “fire and fury.” In a recent speech at the United Nations, Trump said he would “totally destroy” the nation, if necessary, and has derided Kim as “little Rocket Man.” But on Tuesday, his first day on the Korean Peninsula, Trump signalled a willingness to negotiate as he urged Pyongyang to “come to the table” and “make a deal.” He also he'd seen “a lot of progress” in dealing with Pyongyang, though he stopped short of saying whether he wanted direct diplomatic talks. “It makes sense for North Korea to come to the table and make a deal that is good for the people of North Korea and for the world,” Trump said at a news conference with Moon. “I do see certain movement.” He also sounded an optimistic note on disagreements with the North, saying confidently, if vaguely: “Ultimately, it'll all work out.” Ever the showman, Trump had teased that he had a surprise in store, saying at a Tuesday evening banquet that he had an “exciting day” planned Wednesday — “for many reasons that people will find out.” He did not elaborate on what turned out to be the aborted trip to the DMZ. North Korea has fired more than a dozen missiles this year but none in nearly two months. Analysts caution against reading too much into the pause. There's no public sign of any diplomatic progress between Washington and Pyongyang. U.S. officials say the back channel between the State Department and the North Korean mission at the United Nations in New York remains intact, but contacts have not been substantive other than achieving the release of American college student Otto Warmbier in June. He died days after his repatriation to the U.S. Still, Trump's conciliatory comments would be welcome in South Korea, where both the government and the wider population have been unnerved by the president's threats against the North. Trump did note the United States' military options, mentioning that three aircraft carrier groups and a nuclear submarine had been deployed to the region. But he added that “we hope to God we never have to use” the arsenal. And he accused Kim of “threatening millions and millions of lives, so needlessly.” Moon, who has been eager to solidify a friendship with Trump, said he hoped the president's visit would be a turning point in the standoff with North Korea. Visiting the wooded, craggy terrain inside the DMZ is like going back in time to 1953. In July of that year, the Korean War armistice agreement was signed at Panmunjom, the so-called “truce village” bisected by a marker that is the official dividing line between the North and South.

Atomic context and kernel API design

in_atomic()
An API should refrain from making promises that it cannot keep. A recent episode involving the kernel'smacro demonstrates how things can go wrong when a function does not really do what it appears to do. It is also a good excuse to look at an under-documented (but fundamental) aspect of kernel code design.
Kernel code generally runs in one of two fundamental contexts. Process context reigns when the kernel is running directly on behalf of a (usually) user-space process; the code which implements system calls is one example. When the kernel is running in process context, it is allowed to go to sleep if necessary. But when the kernel is running in atomic context, things like sleeping are not allowed. Code which handles hardware and software interrupts is one obvious example of atomic context.
There is more to it than that, though: any kernel function moves into atomic context the moment it acquires a spinlock. Given the way spinlocks are implemented, going to sleep while holding one would be a fatal error; if some other kernel function tried to acquire the same lock, the system would almost certainly deadlock forever.
"Deadlocking forever" tends not to appear on users' wishlists for the kernel, so the kernel developers go out of their way to avoid that situation. To that end, code which is running in atomic context carefully follows a number of rules, including (1) no access to user space, and, crucially, (2) no sleeping. Problems can result, though, when a particular kernel function does not know which context it might be invoked in. The classic example is kmalloc() and friends, which take an explicit argument ( GFP_KERNEL or GFP_ATOMIC ) specifying whether sleeping is possible or not.
The wish to write code which can work optimally in either context is common, though. Some developers, while trying to write such code, may well stumble across the following definitions from <linux/hardirq.h> :
/* * Are we doing bottom half or hardware interrupt processing? * Are we in a softirq context? Interrupt context? */ #define in_irq() (hardirq_count()) #define in_softirq() (softirq_count()) #define in_interrupt() (irq_count()) #define in_atomic() ((preempt_count() & ~PREEMPT_ACTIVE) != 0)
It would seem that in_atomic() would fit the bill for any developer trying to decide whether a given bit of code needs to act in an atomic manner at any specific time. A quick grep through the kernel sources shows that, in fact, in_atomic() has been used in quite a few different places for just that purpose. There is only one problem: those uses are almost certainly all wrong.
The in_atomic() macro works by checking whether preemption is disabled, which seems like the right thing to do. Handlers for events like hardware interrupts will disable preemption, but so will the acquisition of a spinlock. So this test appears to catch all of the cases where sleeping would be a bad idea. Certainly a number of people who have looked at this macro have come to that conclusion.
But if preemption has not been configured into the kernel in the first place, the kernel does not raise the "preemption count" when spinlocks are acquired. So, in this situation (which is common - many distributors still do not enable preemption in their kernels), in_atomic() has no way to know if the calling code holds any spinlocks or not. So it will return zero (indicating process context) even when spinlocks are held. And that could lead to kernel code thinking that it is running in process context (and acting accordingly) when, in fact, it is not.
Given this problem, one might well wonder why the function exists in the first place, why people are using it, and what developers can really do to get a handle on whether they can sleep or not. Andrew Morton answered the first question in a relatively cryptic way:
in_atomic() is for core kernel use only. Because in special circumstances (ie: kmap_atomic()) we run inc_preempt_count() even on non-preemptible kernels to tell the per-arch fault handler that it was invoked by copy_*_user() inside kmap_atomic(), and it must fail.
In other words, in_atomic() works in a specific low-level situation, but it was never meant to be used in a wider context. Its placement in hardirq.h next to macros which can be used elsewhere was, thus, almost certainly a mistake. As Alan Stern pointed out, the fact that Linux Device Drivers recommends the use of in_atomic() will not have helped the situation. Your editor recommends that the authors of that book be immediately sacked.
Once these mistakes are cleared up, there is still the question of just how kernel code should decide whether it is running in an atomic context or not. The real answer is that it just can't do that. Quoting Andrew Morton again:
The consistent pattern we use in the kernel is that callers keep track of whether they are running in a schedulable context and, if necessary, they will inform callees about that. Callees don't work it out for themselves.
This pattern is consistent through the kernel - once again, the GFP_ flags example stands out in this regard. But it's also clear that this practice has not been documented to the point that kernel developers understand that things should be done this way. Consider this recent posting from Rusty Russell, who understands these issues better than most:
This flag indicates what the allocator should do when no memory is immediately available: should it wait (sleep) while memory is freed or swapped out (GFP_KERNEL), or should it return NULL immediately (GFP_ATOMIC). And this flag is entirely redundant: kmalloc() itself can figure out whether it is able to sleep or not.
TACOMA, Washington (Reuters) - A U.S. soldier accused of killing five fellow servicemen at a military combat stress center in Baghdad in 2009 entered no plea at an arraignment on Monday at a military base in Washington state.

Sergeant John Russell, 48, is accused of going on a shooting spree at Camp Liberty, near the Baghdad airport, in an assault the military said at the time could have been triggered by combat stress.
Russell, of the 54th Engineer Battalion based in Bamberg, Germany, faces five charges of premeditated murder, one charge of aggravated assault and one charge of attempted murder in connection with the May 2009 shootings. Six months ago, he was ordered to stand trial in a military court that has the power to sentence him to death, if he is convicted.
Two of the five people killed in the shooting were medical staff officers at the counseling center for troops experiencing combat stress. The others were soldiers.
Russell, tall and broad-shouldered with a military crew-cut and glasses, was mostly silent during the 15-minute hearing, answering only “Yes, sir” and “No, sir” to the judge's questions.
Russell's attorney, James Culp, waived hearing of the charges on Russell's behalf and entered no plea for him, which is common practice in military justice procedure. No date has been set for the court-martial, but both military prosecutors and defense attorneys indicated on Monday that it could begin in March.
SENSITIVE TIME
The arraignment, at Joint Base Lewis-McChord near Tacoma, Washington, comes at a sensitive time for the Army, which is in the process of deciding how to prosecute Staff Sergeant Robert Bales, a soldier accused of killing Afghan villagers in cold blood earlier this year.
A two-week hearing at Lewis-McChord to establish if there is sufficient evidence to send Bales to a court-martial wrapped up last week after harrowing testimony from Afghan adults and children wounded in the attack.
Bales' civilian defense lawyers have suggested he was suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder.
On Monday, Russell's attorney outlined a defense based on his declining mental state.
Russell suffered from depression, thoughts of suicide, anxiety and stress from multiple deployments, and suffered “at least one traumatic experience involving civilian casualties” and “mass grave sites” while serving in Bosnia and Kosovo during 1998 and 1999, Culp said in presenting arguments to the judge after the arraignment.
Culp and military defense lawyers, through telephone testimony presented by forensic psychiatric experts, told the judge they planned to use a Magnetic Resonance Imaging test to prove that Russell had brain damage.
Another defense witness testified that forensic hypnosis would be needed to unlock Russell's memories of the shootings on May 11, 2009.
Government witness Dr. Ronald Schouten, a forensic psychiatrist at Boston's Massachusetts General Hospital, argued against the effectiveness of either.
“If we're doing brain imaging now, it doesn't tell us what it was three years ago,” Schouten said. Later, he added: “Hypnosis has long been recognized as invalid and prone to providing inaccurate information.”
Dr. Robert Sadoff of the University of Pennsylvania, one of the country's top experts in forensic psychiatry, is scheduled to testify as a defense witness on Tuesday.
In a rematch of the 2011 MLS Cup, Houston and LA continued to go in opposite directions in their 2012 campaigns, with the Dynamo fighting for a 2-1 comeback victory against the Galaxy on a steamy Saturday afternoon at BBVA Compass Stadium.
Houston, now undefeated in four, sent LA to their third-consecutive defeat and eighth overall by capitalizing on Mike McGee's own goal in the 38th minute when Andre Hainault marked his 100th MLS start by heading Brad Davis' in-swinger into the bottom corner in the 57th minute.
The Galaxy (3-8-2) continued their nightmare start, and are now winless in seven games and sit in last place in the Western Conference on 11 points. Houston (4-3-4) won their second game at their new home after drawing twice following their 1-0 victory against D.C. United in the stadium opener.
After going down in the first 10 minutes when Edson Buddle coolly slotted the ball past Tally Hall, Houston's pressure started to match the 90-degree heat, putting LA on the back foot.
Magee's own goal was their eventual reward. Brian Ching, who came close to equalizing twice but sent his shots over the bar, controlled a well-placed feed from Je-Vaughn Watson and found a tight angle to his liking, crushing a shot off the crossbar and leaving the Galaxy winger in a bang-bang situation. Unfortunately for Magee and the Galaxy, his attempt to bring the ball down resulted in a rebound into an empty net to even the match.
Houston continued to push forward, and both Will Bruin and Watson came close to giving the home side the lead in the first half but, like their captain, they sent their chances over the crossbar despite quality service from Houston's left-sided duo of Davis and Corey Ashe.
LA suffered yet another defeat in a game that looked, at least early on, like it could be the nudge in the right direction the defending MLS champions have been looking for. Without stars Landon Donovan and Robbie Keane, who were both away on international duty, the Galaxy found early success when Buddle broke out of his scoring slump to make it 1-0 in the 10th minute.
Buddle, David Beckham and Chad Barrett carved up the Dynamo defense with three excellent passes, and the ball ended up at the feet of the LA forward, who exploited space between Bobby Boswell and Andre Hainault to slot home a smooth right-to-left finish and break his 10-game streak without a goal.
Bryan Jordan appeared to have given LA a two-goal lead in the 29th minute, but the celebrations were short lived. The midfielder collected a ball just outside the six-yard box and fired it past Hall, but the assistant referee's raised flag negated the play.
LA came inches away from taking a 2-1 lead in the 51st minute when Beckham showed his class, hitting a bending shot from a 25-yard free kick that Hall did well to parry away. That was the last real chance the defending champions had to salvage a result.
After Hainault's winner, the final 33 minutes unfolded with few chances. Houston put their foot on the ball, slowing the pace in the heat and providing few chances for the visiting Galaxy to climb back into the match.
Both clubs will take a break from MLS play next weekend, but will begin U.S. Open Cup play this week. LA will travel to Carolina to take on the RailHawks on Tuesday, while Houston travels to San Antonio to face the Scorpions on May 29 before hosting Valencia CF in the BBVA Compass Dynamo Charities Cup on May 31.
A top Pentagon budget official told a congressional panel yesterday that the military is reexamining how it uses contractors and how it spends money on large, costly weapons programs.
Testifying before the House Budget Committee, Robert F. Hale, undersecretary of defense-comptroller and chief financial officer at the Pentagon, noted that more jobs that had been done by government employees over the last decade are now outsourced to contractors.
"We need to look at how many contractors we are using and are there cost-effective ways we could do that in-house," Hale said.
President Obama has said he favors cutting back on the use of contractors. He also has called for cutting down on the number of no-bid deals.
Hale said the Pentagon is likely to "move more to fixed-price" contracts and away from cost-plus deals, where the government is more at risk for cost overruns.
The House Budget hearing comes as Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates is putting the finishing touches on the Pentagon's proposed $663.7 billion budget. Defense contractors and analysts expect Gates to push for delaying or cutting some major programs.
Defense spending has more than doubled in the last eight years. Obama's base budget of $533.7 billion for the Defense Department is about 4 percent more than the $513.3 billion appropriated for this year's budget. The rest of the money is for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
Several congressional leaders, who are worried about a loss of jobs in their districts if weapons programs are canceled, questioned Hale about what Gates might do on specific programs, but he gave few details.
Hale said that Pentagon senior leaders are going to "reassess all weapons programs, especially those that have experienced execution problems" and continue reshaping the Defense Department to focus on more unconventional warfare, rather than fighter jets and tanks.
Lawmakers questioned whether Gates would consider cutting back some missile defense programs after a General Accountability Office report warned that the cost might climb as much as $3 billion more than earlier estimates.
"The secretary has said he'd be willing to terminate some programs if he thinks it is the right thing to do," Hale said. With some missile defense programs, he said, it "may be appropriate to do that."
"Nothing's off the table in this review, but no final decisions have been made," he said.
Michael J. Sullivan, director of acquisition and sourcing management at the Government Accountability Office, also testified, calling the Pentagon's acquisition program "fragmented and broken." He said 95 of the military's largest weapons programs are nearly $300 billion over budget and 21 months late on average.
Sullivan said projects often go forward without proper planning or with overly optimistic cost estimates, and often suffer from too many technical unknowns. Programs including the Global Hawk Unmanned Aircraft System, F-22A, the Expeditionary Fighting Vehicle and Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile have had poor engineering planning and other trouble, he said.
The Ducks have recalled center Chris Wagner from the San Diego Gulls, Anaheim's primary development affiliate in the American Hockey League (AHL).
Wagner, 24 (5/27/91), scored 1-1=2 points with a +2 rating and 16 penalty minutes (PIM) in three games with the Gulls this season. Assigned from Anaheim to San Diego on Oct. 20, Wagner made his Gulls debut on Oct. 21 at San Jose and earned his first points of the season on Oct. 23 in San Jose (1-1=2). He has appeared in one game for Anaheim this season, going scoreless on one shot on Oct. 16 vs. Colorado.
Selected in the fifth round (122nd overall) of the 2010 NHL Draft, Wagner went scoreless with two PIM in his NHL debut with Anaheim in 2014-15 (nine games). Wagner also appeared in his first two career Stanley Cup Playoff games, going scoreless in the First Round vs. Winnipeg. The 6-0, 195 pounds forward scored 15-13=28 points with 65 PIM in 48 games with Norfolk (AHL) in 2014-15, setting a career high in goals and matching a career high in points.
Summary Author: Björn Sothmann
in the area around Heavy rainfall in the area around Geneva, Switzerland , during the last few days of April and first two days of May caused the water level of the Arve River to rise dramatically. The discharge of the river reached about 31,783 cu ft (900 cu m) per second -- the average discharge being 2,754 cu ft (78 cu m) per second. This is the highest value recorded since the start of measurements back in 1935.
The flooding could be clearly seen from the Pont de la Jonction in Geneva. Here, the relatively clear water from the Rhône River, coming out of Lake Geneva, meets the muddy water of the Arve. Normally the Rhône carries more water than the Arve, but in early May, the Arve's flow was greater. Click here to see more pictures of the flooding. Photo taken on May 2, 2015.

Still, determining just what is and is not a Carolina dog requires a kind of gut instinct. To Mr. Anderson, it's a matter of “I know it when I see it”; Dr. Brisbin is more blunt.
“The Carolina dog is a breed created by Brisbin,” he said, referring to himself in the third person, “by picking dogs he likes, the type that he thinks typify the ancient dog.”
This is not to say the Carolina dog is more mythic than real. But the problem is that some of the wilder dogs have mated with other breeds — local dogs and even coyotes. Determining just what is a Carolina dog means becoming more finely tuned to the sense that anyone feels stepping into Don Anderson's enclosed acre. Experiential knowledge is crucial, being able to sense the entirety of the animal and in that way recognize which dog is almost purely Carolina and which is more of a mix.
Most Carolina dogs are ginger-colored, like Australian dingoes, but they can also be black and piebald. Most, but not all, are short-haired.
Some have tiny patches, right above their distinctive almond eyes, that look like a spare set of eyes, what Mr. Anderson calls “spirit eyes.” Some have an unusual white stripe at the shoulder. There are the noticeable ears and the tail, but also the athletic tucked-in stomach (like a Doberman). DNA studies may soon make it easier to assert the Carolina's distinctions from other dogs.
Early Sightings
Awareness of this unusual dog has its own history. According to Mark Eden, another enthusiast working with Mr. Anderson, the journals of the 16th-century Spanish explorer Hernando de Soto include possible references to Carolina dogs.
In the essential narrative of early American natural history, William Bartram's 1791 book “Bartram's Travels,” the author runs across a Seminole Indian maintaining some horses and writes: “One occurrence, remarkable here, was a troop of horse under the control and care of a single black dog, which seemed to differ in no respect from the wolf of Florida, except his being able to bark as the common dog.”

Looking to adopt a purebred Beagle dog in the Washington DC area? Lilly is an absolutely adorable 3 year old Beagle looking for a very loving home. Very sweet and well-behaved, she has been lovingly cared for by her owner since she was a puppy. Lilly is healthy, spayed and vaccinated. She is very well behaved and housebroken.
All About Lilly – Beagle Rehomed in Baltimore MD Washington DC
Life has been cruel to Lilly's owner as of late. She was involved in a serious car accident from which she barely escaped with her life. After multiple surgeries, she has chronic pain and disability. If this weren't enough to deal with, she and her husband divorced, and she has been left to fend for herself and her dogs on a very limited budget.
As much as she would dearly love to keep her beloved Beagle girls, the owner is not able to afford their care, and her disability makes it very difficult to provide them with the exercise and playtime they need and very much deserve.
The best possible scenario for these sweet girls and their loving owner would be to find them each a home where they will receive plenty of love, attention, care, playtime, exercise, good nutrition and veterinary care. They would make such a wonderful addition to the home of retired or stay-at-home Beagle lovers who are looking for the sweetest dogs ever.
The owner is experiencing such a sense of loss in having to rehome her dogs. It would be so great to find new owners who would be willing to stay in touch with her, and even allow the occasional visit. Hopefully that would be OK with their new owners.

In a New York Times/CBS News poll last month of 1,110 adults nationwide, 63 percent of respondents said they would favor a ban on high-capacity magazines, while 34 percent opposed the idea. The N.R.A. has repeatedly and staunchly opposed a ban, arguing that it would have no effect on gun violence and that it would leave such equipment in the hands of criminals alone.
In a 2004 report for the National Institute of Justice that studied the impact of the 1994 assault weapons ban (which expired in 2004), the authors found that high-capacity magazines were used in crimes much more often than assault weapons were. They said that guns equipped with those magazines tended to account for a higher share of guns used in the killing of police officers and in mass public shootings, though those are a small percentage of overall gun deaths.
Many gun experts and lawmakers believe the two areas ripe for legislative consensus are a bill that would make background checks for gun buyers nearly universal, and a measure that would create a federal statute against straw purchasing, which would give prosecutors better tools to go after people who buy guns that they sell or give to others to commit crimes.
“If you prioritize things in terms of their value and likelihood of them getting passed,” said James Pasco, the executive director of the Fraternal Order of Police, “I don't think there is anyone who will tell you that background checks aren't the most important thing to get done.” Law enforcement officials say that combining background checks and straw purchasing penalties would do much to reduce the criminal use of guns.
But many lawmakers, gun violence experts and victims argue that large-capacity magazines, which gun rights advocates say are convenient for target shooting, increase carnage in shootings. President Obama has called for a maximum magazine capacity of 10 rounds. The police have said that Adam Lanza had a 30-round magazine on his semiautomatic rifle in Newtown.
Mark E. Kelly, Ms. Giffords's husband, testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee in January that Christina Taylor Green, a 9-year-old girl killed in the Tucson shooting, was shot with the 13th bullet in the assailant's gun. “I am 100 percent sure these magazines have an effect on the number of people killed,” Mr. Kelly said in a later interview.
Such magazines “are so easy to see as a menace to our society,” said Senator Frank R. Lautenberg, Democrat of New Jersey, who is sponsoring legislation that seeks to ban the sale of magazines of more than 10 rounds.
In a statement on Monday, the Libyan government expressed appreciation to “all countries who participated in this operation” and gave special thanks to “the United States of America and the Republic of Cyprus.”
The transitional government established in Tripoli after the fall of Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi in 2011 has suffered many humiliations, including the kidnapping of its prime minister by a small group of militiamen and the recent sacking of its Parliament by a lightly armed mob. But the loss of control of its oil revenue, despite days of bluster by the prime minister at the time, Ali Zeidan, appeared to shake the government far more seriously.
Almost as soon as the tanker reached international waters last week, the transitional Parliament voted to remove Mr. Zeidan from office, even before a consensus on who would succeed him could be reached. Parliament made the interim defense minister, Abdullah al-Thinni, the acting prime minister for a term of two weeks.
Now the American intervention has dealt a serious blow to perhaps the Libyan government's greatest foe, Ibrahim Jathran, the 33-year-old leader of the eastern Libyan militia that blockaded the ports and tried to sell the oil.
Mr. Jathran, a former rebel who fought against Colonel Qaddafi, was initially named to lead a force protecting the oil infrastructure. He has since allied himself with the so-called federalist movement demanding more power, autonomy and oil revenue for the nation's eastern region, which contains most of Libya's reserves. He has refused to reopen the ports until the central government agrees to investigate allegations of corruption in its oil sales and give the east a larger cut of the proceeds.
America's willingness to foil his illicit exports goes a long way to level the balance of power. The government in Tripoli has been unable to force Mr. Jathran to reopen the ports or allow the official sale of the oil. Now, he appears unable to sell the oil on his own, returning both sides to a stalemate — with the oil remaining in place.
Still, even as the tanker sailed back, there were reminders that the situation was not Libya's only source of political instability. A series of car bombings on Monday at a military academy graduation ceremony in Benghazi killed at least eight people, most believed to be graduating cadets, and wounded more than a dozen, hospital and security officials said.
Islamist militants in Benghazi, who oppose federalists like Mr. Jathran, have been waging a campaign of bombings and assassinations usually aimed at former members of Qaddafi security forces. But Monday's attack appeared to be the first time the militants have targeted recruits to Libya's fledgling national army, cadets with no possible ties to the Qaddafi government.
Mark your calendars now for the 27th of November, 2009. That's when you'll be able to get your hands on Gran Turismo 5 in the UK, according to Play. We've checked our usual Sony press sources and there's no confirmed date from them yet, but the 27th is at least a Friday, so let's hope it checks out. We'll continue to keep an eye on this but we've heard recently that both version of GT, 5 and the PSP one, are pretty much done and ready to go, so a late 2009 release does hold some weight – here's hoping.
In related news, Codemasters must be kicking themselves because the F1 license is dead. Autosport writes that following a four-hour meeting at Renault's Enstone factory, Ferrari, McLaren, Renault, BMW Sauber, Toyota, Brawn, Red Bull Racing and Scuderia Toro Rosso said they had grown frustrated with the FIA's stance on some issues and had decided to create a series of their own. I don't follow F1 so have no idea of the implications of this, apart from the notion that Gran Turismo 5 is probably safer sticking to the WRC and NASCAR licenses it has already picked up.

SACRAMENTO, CA - The California Public Employees' Retirement System (CalPERS) today announced it has joined over 100 fellow investors asking major U.S. and international banks backing the Dakota Access Pipeline to address the concerns of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe.
The investors, which include four New York City pension funds, Boston Common Asset Management, Calvert, and Storebrand Asset Management, called on the banks to act "to protect the banks' reputation, consumer base, and avoid legal liabilities."
"Banks with financial ties to the Dakota Access Pipeline may be implicated in these controversies and may face long-term brand and reputational damage resulting from consumer boycotts and possible legal liability," said the investors in a statement. "We call on the banks to address or support the tribe's request for a rerouting and utilize their influence as a project lender to reach a peaceful solution that is acceptable to all parties, including the tribe."
The statement was directed to 17 banks, including Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ, Bayerische Landesbank, BancoBilbao Vizcaya Argentaria, BNP Paribas, Citibank, Crédit Agricole, DNB, Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, ING, Intesa Sanpaolo, Mizuho Bank, Natixis, Société Générale, Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corp., SunTrust Bank, Toronto-Dominion Bank, and Wells Fargo.
CalPERS has about $6.5 billion invested in 16 of the 17 banks as a shareholder and creditor, as of Dec. 31, 2016.
CalPERS' Investment Beliefs and Global Governance Principles both call out the importance of corporate responsibility on environmental and community matters, and both clearly state that engaging with companies is one of the most effective ways to address major issues.
"We are pleased to join our fellow investors to help address the community concerns and environmental risks that can impact the long-term returns of our investments," said Anne Simpson, CalPERS' investment director, sustainability. "We believe that engaging with the companies we own is the first course of action to effect change and a preferred option over divestment where we lose our voice as an investor."
View the statement and list of signatories (PDF).
For more than eight decades, CalPERS has built retirement and health security for state, school, and public agency members who invest their lifework in public service. Our pension fund serves more than 1.8 million members in the CalPERS retirement system and administers benefits for more than 1.4 million members and their families in our health program, making us the largest defined-benefit public pension in the U.S. CalPERS' total fund market value currently stands at approximately $311 billion.

A registered nurse admitted on a 911 recording to killing her husband the day after Christmas, and then setting his bed on fire.
Holly Ridge Police Chief John Maiorano says Sherry Poindexter called 911 late Friday afternoon saying she had shot her husband and started a fire in their home.
"We had a bad argument and I really didn't mean to," the woman told 911 in an emotional call that lasted nearly five minutes. "He keeps the gun laying beside the bed and I picked it up and the next thing I knew it just was going off."
53-year-old Barry Poindexter's body was found in a bed in the South Green Street home, and Maiorano says an accelerant was used to start the fire either on or near that bed.
The woman was asked by a 911 operator why she set the bed on fire. "He looked terrible, terrible. I didn't want anybody to see him looking like that. He's a good looking man. (crying)"
Asked how she knew her husband was dead, Poindexter said, "I'm a nurse, he's dead."
The chief says the two got into an argument which led to the shooting. He said Poindexter turned in a weapon that she said was used, but two other guns where found in the home so they are continuing to investigate which weapon was actually used.
The SBI and the Onslow County Fire Marshal's Office is assisting in the murder investigation.
The 57-year-old woman remains in jail without bond and went before a judge this morning.
The North Carolina Board of Nursing says Poindexter received her permanent RN license in 2011 and had no disciplinary actions against her.
Previous Story
A home was intentionally set on fire in Onslow County the day after Christmas.
Onslow County Fire Marshal Brian Kelly says they responded to a fire on 412 South Green St in Holly Ridge around 5:00 p.m.
Kelly says the fire was contained to one room of the house, but isn't saying which room at this time.
Kelly did not say who was home at the time of the fire.
He did confirm that multiple agencies are investigating, including Holly Ridge PD, Jacksonville PD, the Onslow County Sheriff's Office, and the State Bureau of Investigation.
We talked to Onslow County Sheriff' Hans Miller who says a terrible thing happened at the home, and the sheriff's office will assist Holly Ridge police however it can.
Kelly says more information on the investigation and possible suspects will be released Monday.
Even at the age of 40, Vladimir Guerrero can still crush the long ball.
The beautiful swing with no batting gloves, it's still there.
The former MLB all-star returned to the field as one of five participants in the first-ever Caribbean Series Home Run Derby in the Dominican Republic Wednesday and he was the star of show, despite being eliminated after the first round with just three home runs.
“I didn't think I was going to hit one home run, but thank God I hit three,” Guerrero told Jesse Sanchez of MLB.com. “It's been a while since I retired, and I'm really happy.”
Guerrero, who hit 449 career home runs in 16 MLB seasons with the Montreal Expos, Los Angeles Angels, Texas Rangers and Baltimore Orioles, will be eligible for the Hall of Fame for the first time next year.
The Guerrero family still has a strong presence in the baseball world, as 16-year-old prospect Vladimir Guerrero Jr. signed with the Toronto Blue Jays this past summer and Vladimir Sr.'s nephews, Gregory Guerrero and Jose Guerrero, are in the minors with the New York Mets. Another family member, Josue Guerrero, is expected to land a deal during the next international signing period, which begins on July 2, 2016.
Former Cincinnati Reds prospect Felix Perez ended up winning the event.
Judge accepts jury verdict that awarded $2.9 million to family affected by air emissions from gas and oil wells near their Wise County home.
The judge presiding over a pivotal case involving toxic emissions from gas and oil drilling has accepted a jury verdict that awarded $2.9 million to a family who said the emissions have made them sick.
Judge Mark Greenberg issued a one page ruling late Thursday denying a motion by Aruba Petroleum to reject the jury's verdict. Among Aruba's arguments rejected by Greenberg were that Bob and Lisa Parr did not prove the emissions that made them sick came from Aruba wells.
The Parrs filed their lawsuit in March 2011, claiming they were “under constant, perpetual, and inescapable assault of Defendants' releases, spills, emissions, and discharges of hazardous gases, chemicals, and industrial/hazardous wastes.”
Following a two-week trial in April, a Dallas County jury found that Aruba “intentionally created a private nuisance” that affected the family's health and awarded the Parrs damages. The case is one of the first successful U.S. lawsuits alleging that toxic air emissions from oil and gas production have sickened people living nearby.
Lisa Parr said Greenberg's ruling further validates the family's claim of being made sick by emissions generated by Aruba.
“We have had a jury hear the evidence and say that it was Aruba's fault,” Parr said. “Now we have a judge who heard the evidence say that the jury was right.”
The company had earlier paid $108,000 to settle a court case brought against it by the Texas Attorney General's Office. In that case, an inspector for the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality was sickened after he began collecting air samples in response to a complaint from the Parrs, according to an agency report. Using an infrared camera, he identified "heavy plumes" of emissions wafting from the Aruba facility and toward the Parr house, 280 feet away.
Greenberg's ruling sets the stage for a possible appeal by Aruba, a step that could take the case into a system that becomes progressively more political and philosophically in tune with business at its higher levels.
Neither a spokesman for Aruba nor the company's attorneys were available for comment. But legal experts expect the company to appeal the decision.
"Losing this case was not good for the industry," said Thomas McGarity, a University of Texas law school professor who specializes in environmental and administrative law, in an interview with InsideClimate News last month.
"My guess is the industry will coalesce around this case. The industry will want to stop the dam from breaking wide open...This is where they will take a stand."
Aruba, a privately owned company based in Plano, Texas, argued that there was no way to fix the blame on its operations. More than 100 wells have been drilled within two miles of the Parrs' property, and only 22 of them are owned by Aruba.

EVERTON FC will significantly boost their global presence next season when they sign a new three-year kit deal with Nike.
The Blues, who currently wear Le Coq Sportif strips, will enter the big league of kit manufacturers by wearing shirts designed by the US sportswear giant which boasts Barcelona, Manchester United and Brazil as customers.
Reports elsewhere today that the deal will result in David Moyes being handed a £10m transfer war-chest are wide of the mark, with the Blues set to prosper more in marketing opportunities than by an immediate up-front influx of cash.

Supporters are likely to get their first glimpse of the new home shirt before the end of the season in May, and the team could then be set to wear it in their final home game of the season against Newcastle.
Nike will make the home, away and third strip for the Toffees - the first time they have dipped their toe in the Merseyside football market.
The deal comes as a result of Everton's established £30m contract with sports retailers Kitbag to market the club's merchandise worldwide.
Signed by chief executive Robert Elstone in 2009 the agreement was the biggest commercial contract in the club's 131-year history, as Kitbag - who have their own contracts with Le Coq Sportif and Nike - took responsibility for high street shopping, mail order and the club's online store.
Meanwhile, Phil Jagielka admits he may be forced to spend much of the most pivotal period of Everton's campaign watching from the bench.
The England defender made his comeback from a knee ligament injury with a 90-minute run-out for the second string in the goalless mini-derby against Liverpool at Goodison this week.
In his absence, Everton have embarked on an eight-match unbeaten run with John Heitinga and Sylvain Distin forging a formidable partnership.
“It was good to get the 90 minutes under my belt,” said the England international.

“I have been training since last week and now I've had this so hopefully I will be challenging to be in the squad at the weekend.
“We have got a lot of games coming up so it's important to have as many people fit as possible. Johnny and Sylvain have been playing well and if I have to sit on the bench for a month because we are winning then so be it.”
Meanwhile, Darron Gibson could be back towards the end of this month. “The word I am getting is that it doesn't look as if it's too bad, so hopefully it won't be too long before he's back,” said Moyes.
The government sucks. The infrastructure sucks. The healthcare system sucks. The politicians, the media even the show-business suck. You hate all of them despite the fact that there are honest people that try to improve those things and dedicate time and effort to make them work in your favor. Of course that is simply not happening right now and all of the love you once had for your country is somewhere in between the pages of a history textbook.
You still love the nature of your country – the lakes, the rivers, the mountains, the birds and the flowers. You love the people, the common folks that struggle for a everyday living and still have the time to smile at you and to share a story or just to wish you well. You feel connected to them and you know that you won't find the same connection anywhere else in the world.
There is no place like home.
But home is where hope is.
There is no hope left here for you so you're saying to yourself: “Maybe there is hope somewhere else…” and this is the real driving force behind any individual that leaves it's home country in order to find a better place to live. Perhaps 90% of all search for a better paid job in order to sustain a family or themselves. Cultural differences are not so bad when your belly is full and you have the financial stability and security. Money can't buy you happiness but they do give hope and security and many will settle for that.
The disconnection is present though. From the earliest age you where nurtured to love your home-country and everything about it maybe even some wrongdoings but that is a different subject. The fact is that yes many people like to travel to distant places, to meet different cultures and lifestyles maybe even to settle for a while and get the real taste of living in those places but their hearts and minds will always crave to return to the one place they felt connected to in their upbringing.
I am not an academic I just try to use common sense from my perspective and from the things I feel about that subject matter. I don't love my government, I hate it – it gave me nothing. It makes me work bullshit jobs (even those are hard to find nowadays) to get a bullshit paycheck that covers the expenses to get to the bullshit job. I don't have money in the bank and the only good thing is I did not fall for their shitty loans either. I don't love my government. I hate it – it made all my friends leave this place. It devastated the lives of my neighbors, my life, the lives of all of us – here or abroad it doesn't matter. It was supposed to be our government, a democratic one that will bring this country to it's feet after a 45 year period of isolation. What the fuck happened? 25 years later where are we? Nowhere. No roads, no healthcare, no industry, no purpose, no future. But let's get to the point:
I really want to love my government because I love my country.
The problem is that you can't love something that you consider an obstacle (bureaucracy, anyone?!). You can't love something that is so deeply entangled in the net of it's own caused problems that it's basic functions like education, health and social security deteriorate and cease to work for everyone. It's just not possible. Here is what's possible in my opinion:
I think it's possible to receive an Unconditional Basic Income – a monthly cash transfer from your government simply because your government, well… simply because your government loves you… or at least it should… in general.
Crazy idea, right?
“Your government loves YOU.” – How about that, ha? That's a real twist, right?
“My government loves me!?” – just let it sink there for a while.
“My government loves me! It just gave me money for free!”
Oh, my! Can you imagine that?!
I know I can.
Imagine that your country is the first to implement that kind of investment in it's citizens. How proud would you be? How will that unconditional love and faith stated by your government to you, individually, would make you feel? Will it make you feel more civilized, more responsible, more cherished and more loved by the thing that is supposed to cherish you, love you, serve and protect you?
I know I would be.
I know I would feel the responsibility to prove that I'm worth it. I know I won't run off with the first transfer and never come back, because like it or not, this is my place, this is my country and this is my home. This is the only place on Earth that I will feel most connected to for as long as I live. Hell, yeah! I would love to improve it for the future generations. Hell, yeah! I would like to do that! There is no greater purpose in life than this! The coming generations are OUR generations, our own offspring and we will be judged by not how we found the place, but by the state that we will leave it to them.
So it's time to stir up the waters.
Those in power have the power and the opportunity to turn the table. It's up to them to make it work. We are sick and tired of being sick and tired. We as citizens must demand our right to be loved. We must believe that our governments believe in us. Any other case will just end up bad as we have seen in so many cases of the past.
The Unconditional Basic Income idea is the most advanced idea that can be implemented and that can start to work right now and anywhere. Enough with the austerity measures and the “more jobs” mantras of the past. It's the information age and we've landed on a fucking comet for Christ's sake! Imagine what else can we accomplish if we had the chance and the opportunity to turn down a shitty job offer.
Housekeeping is a job! Raising kids is a job! Creating a beautiful painting is a job! We will never stop to develop, discover, create and produce, to design and to implement, to expand, to flourish and to evolve but it's the current model that is slowing us down, it's keeping us poor and neglected, unwilling to take part and miserable, concerned with the pure survival and the basic needs – more of a burden than of a blessing. No one can accept that anymore. No one likes to feel as a burden – not even to the state.
It's not people's fault that they hate their governments. It's not their fault that they can't participate as equal citizens in the society, the political and the social life. It's the set of rules that govern us and that are superimposed on us by our governments. A set of rules that are no longer adequate in the present. Cold, industrialized, dogmatic, machine rules that turn man into machines. You get what you nurture but we are not machines! We're human beings! And we demand to be treated like ones!
Basic Income is a human right! So, show us your love governments…
Or expect our well nurtured hatred!
The people have spoken. The machines are tired.
I am serious… government. You need help.

The lectures of Nobel Prize winning physicist Richard Feynman were legendary. Footage of these lectures does exist, but they are most famously preserved in The Feynman Lectures. The three-volume set may be the most popular collection of physics books ever written, and now you can access it online, in its entirety, for free.

The complete online edition of The Feynman Lectures on Physics has been made available in HTML 5 through a collaboration between Caltech (where Feyman first delivered these talks, in the early 1960s) and The Feynman Lectures Website. The online edition is "high quality up-to-date copy of Feynman's legendary lectures," and, thanks to the implementation of scalable vector graphics, "has been designed for ease of reading on devices of any size or shape; text, figures and equations can all be zoomed without degradation."
Volume I deal mainly with mechanics, radiation and heat; Volume II with electromagnetism and matter; and Volume III with quantum mechanics.

The New York Times acknowledged on Wednesday that the Ted Cruz book, A Time For Truth, belongs on its best-seller list and gave it a no. 7 ranking in nonfiction, after snubbing it and accusing the Cruz campaign of making “strategic bulk purchases.”
Harper Collins sent an inquiring email to The New York Times last week after the book's impressive sales were ignored by the paper.
“We have uniform standards that we apply to our best seller list, which includes an analysis of book sales that goes beyond simply the number of books sold,” spokeswoman Eileen Murphy said, according to Politico. “This book didn't meet that standard this week.”
Cruz's campaign furiously attacked The New York Times for their deliberate omission.
“The Times is presumably embarrassed by having their obvious partisan bias called out. But their response — alleging ‘strategic bulk purchases' — is a blatant falsehood. The evidence is directly to the contrary. In leveling this false charge, the Times has tried to impugn the integrity of Senator Cruz and of his publisher HarperCollins,” Cruz campaign spokesperson Rick Tyler told Politico on Friday.
Amazon also pushed back. An Amazon spokeswoman said that A Time For Truth was a bestselling book and they found no evidence of “unusual bulk purchase activity.” Cruz's book currently ranks as the number-one best-selling book in “Political Conservatism & Liberalism” on Amazon.
The New York Times backed down on Wednesday without apology while maintaining they did nothing wrong.
“This week's NYT best seller list was arrived at using the same process as last week's — and the week before that. That process involves a careful analysis of data, and is not influenced in any way by the content of a book, or by pressure from publishers or book sellers,” Murphy wrote in an email to The Hill. “Our approach serves Times readers by authenticating broadly popular books through the confidential reporting of a wide range of retailers. In order to avoid compromising that process, we do not disclose who reports sales to us.”

The FDA wasn't wrong to regulate e-cigarettes. It was wrong to effectively ban, by its own estimate, up to 98.5% of the e-cigarettes on the market today.
E-cigarettes, Public Health England says, are about 95% less harmful than smoking, are not a gateway to smoking, and could help smokers quit.
Now, the FDA wants to put an end to this less harmful alternative to smoking.
It's very simple: Cigarette smokers who switch to e-cigarettes dramatically reduce their risk, as the Royal College of Physicians put it in a landmark report last month, by using “nicotine without smoke.”
E-cigarette shouldn't be sold to minors, and government should restrict advertising so they aren't marketed to kids. But the FDA's drastic overstep today will require e-cigarettes not already on the market by February 2007 to undergo a costly and onerous Premarket Tobacco Application process that holds e-cigarettes to a standard nearly impossible to prove, and one that well-established actual cigarettes don't have to face.
In 2007, e-cigarettes were in their infancy and the first generation iPhone was introduced. Imagine being told that all new smartphones had to be just like the first generation iPhone or makers would have to jump through regulatory hoops not applied to competing products. Now imagine your life depended on it. You can understand why so many former smokers from across the political spectrum are dead set against this rule. They just want to keep their vapes so they can reduce their risk.
If the FDA can't differentiate between responsible regulation and an effective ban, let me help: Reasonable rules institute vapor battery standards, marketing restrictions and a ban on sales to minors.
These are requirements in a bipartisan bill that would stop the FDA from subjecting e-cigarettes on the market to perhaps unprovable standards that would put small and innovative competitors to Big Tobacco out of business. Congress can undo some of FDA's damage by including this provision in the final spending bill.

Gaffer Rafa! Benitez takes interim job at Chelsea... but fans furious and Pep has £15m-a-year offer
Guardiola won't make Chelsea decision until 2013, claims agent
Click here to read the full story...
Rafa Benitez will meet Chelsea's shell-shocked players today after being appointed interim manager in the wake of Roberto Di Matteo's brutal dismissal.
Sportsmail exclusively revealed yesterday that Di Matteo was to be sacked and replaced by Benitez after Chelsea's 3-0 defeat against Juventus. The axe duly fell at the club's training ground in the early hours of yesterday morning.
Owner Roman Abramovich wants former Barcelona coach Pep Guardiola to be Di Matteo's long-term successor, and has offered to make him the highest-paid manager in the world on £15million a year.

The Spaniard, who flew back to the UK last night after attending a coaching conference in Abu Dhabi, has been given a six-month contract at Stamford Bridge.
Di Matteo was fired by Chelsea chairman Bruce Buck and chief executive Ron Gourlay at the club's training ground at 3am yesterday after they returned from Turin, where their defeat left the club in serious danger of becoming the first holders to go out in the group stage.
The 42-year-old Italian was crushed to be axed only six months after he guided Chelsea, a club he also served with distinction as a player, to Champions League and FA Cup glory as an emergency replacement for the dismissed Andre Villas-Boas.

Chelsea statement on Di Matteo - in full
Chelsea Football Club has parted company this morning with Manager Roberto Di Matteo.
The team's recent performances and results have not been good enough and the owner and the Board felt that a change was necessary now to keep the club moving in the right direction as we head into a vitally important part of the season.
The club faces a difficult task ahead in qualifying for the knockout stages of the UEFA Champions League as well as maintaining a strong challenge for the top of the Premier League while competing in three other cup competitions. Our aim is to remain as competitive as possible and challenge strongly on all fronts.
The owner and the Board would like to thank Roberto for all he has done for the club since taking over in March. Roberto helped guide us to an historic Champions League victory and a seventh FA Cup. We will never forget the huge contribution he has made to this club's history and he will always be welcome at Stamford Bridge.
The club will be making an announcement shortly regarding a new first team manager.
He released a statement last night in which he pointedly thanked everyone except Abramovich and the club's senior management. ‘Lifting Chelsea's first Champions League trophy was the best achievement in club history and without doubt the highlight of my career,' he said. ‘I have a deep and unreserved passion for Chelsea Football Club and I would like to sincerely thank all of the staff, my players and of course the Chelsea fans, for their tremendous and unconditioned support.'
Assistant manager Eddie Newton, an ally of Di Matteo, will be fired and Steve Holland is also expected to be sacked.
Benitez, who guided Liverpool to Champions League glory in 2005 and a second European Cup final two years later, agreed to take the job after 72 hours of negotiations.
He has the European experience and pedigree that Abramovich demands, but he has been told his priority is to finish in the top four of the Premier League to guarantee Champions League football.
A Chelsea statement issued last night said: ‘The owner and the board believe that in Benitez we have a manager with significant experience at the highest level of football, who can come in and immediately help deliver our objectives. The two-time UEFA manager of the year comes with an outstanding pedigree.'

Chelsea's players are usually required to report for a light warm-down the day after a game, but Di Matteo gave them the day off after the Juve defeat. They will report for a 10.30am training session today and skipper John Terry, who is out with a knee injury, will introduce Benitez to the squad.
The 52-year-old has been out of work since he was fired by the then reigning European champions Inter Milan, just six months after replacing Jose Mourinho. Crucially, he has assured Abramovich he can restore £50m misfit Fernando Torres to former glories. Benitez brought Torres to Anfield from Atletico Madrid in 2007 and the Spain striker once claimed he was the ‘most important coach of my career'.
Who's next? Guardiola and Benitez are in the frame to take the helm at Stamford Bridge
In a statement issued shortly after 9am yesterday, it was all Chelsea could do to thank Di Matteo for his contribution, noting that he had only ‘helped' guide the side to the greatest moment in the club's history.
‘The team's recent performances and results have not been good enough and the owner and the board felt a change was necessary now to keep the club moving in the right direction,' said the statement.
‘The owner and the board would like to thank Roberto for all he has done for the club since taking over in March. Roberto helped guide us to an historic Champions League victory and a seventh FA Cup. We will never forget the huge contribution he has made and he will always be welcome at Stamford Bridge.'
Guardiola's agent was yesterday quoted as saying: ‘He won't decide which club he will coach until January or February. He alone will decide his future. Right now he is with his family, resting, reading, watching football.'

Islamic State fighters have withdrawn from the last territory they controlled in the Aleppo Governorate due to the advancement of the Syrian army, stated the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR) which is based in Britain.
On Saturday, the SOHR reported that a high ranking commanding officer of the "Tiger Forces,” an elite unit in the Syrian Army, was badly injured and two of his subordinates killed when ISIS militants attacked him by launching a rocket at his vehicle while traveling near Raqqa.
The "Tiger Forces" were aiding the Syrian Army to search after ISIS fighters in the south-east villages and suburbs of Aleppo in the hours after the jihadist militants withdrew. Independent reports confirm that while the Syrian army did not yet establish it's presence in all previously ISIS-held territory, no ISIS fighters remain in Aleppo.The Islamic State, however, is far from giving up in other points of conflict. ISIS fighters used artillery to attack the town of Al Mehrem in the Eastern suburbs of Homs earlier in the week.In the attack, property was damaged and one woman wounded. Islamic State is still fighting along various roads in eastern Homs and was recently able to kill a brigadier-general of the Syrian army in the city.Meanwhile, In a Friday sermon, one ISIS leader admitted the terrorist group was defeated in Mosul and said a temporary command post would be established West of Mosul in Tal Afar.The Friday sermon also saw one of the Islamic State leaders burst into tears when he mentioned the name of Abu Bakr al Baghdadi, according to an eyewitness who spoke to Iraqi broadcaster Al Sumaria News. He then recited verses from the Quran that speaks of people who are no longer among the living, Al Sumaria added.If true, this could confirm the Russian statement that it is very likely Baghdadi was killed in June during an attack on the city of Raqqa is Syria. The Russian statement was followed by a similar Iranian one but so far no ISIS spokesperson confirmed or denied the claim.

A Robot Hive
Robots, for all their helpfulness in performing tasks that we would rather not do (usually because those tasks are dangerous or boring), first need to be coded in order to do the work. These specific sets of commands tell the machines what exactly they need to do and define how to do it.
While robots can be coded to acquire knowledge for themselves through machine learning, it would take far too long for a single robot to acquire enough experience to actually be helpful with many complex real-world tasks. To address this, several studies have explored the possibility of building a computer hive mind through which robots could pool their experiences and learn from each other, and three such experiments were recounted on the Google Research Blog.
One study gave robots a chance to learn from raw experience. They were given a task that they were allowed to solve on a trial-and-error basis (opening a door). Successes and failures were pooled in a central server, the set of commands that yielded the best results were sent back to the robots, and the cycle continued until the task was mastered.
Instead of building on raw experience, another study programmed the robots to build a predictive model from their shared experience, which could then be used to perform the task. Those robots were allowed to interact freely with objects on a table, share their experiences with each other, and together build a single predictive model that attempted to forecast what the world might look like in response to their future actions.
Utah's Legislature sent Gov. Gary Herbert a measure lowering the state's legal threshold for drunken driving to a .05 percent blood-alcohol content Wednesday – a bill that will make Utah's DUI threshold the lowest in the nation if Herbert signs it into law as expected.
Herbert's public information officer, Kirsten Rappleye, said in an emailed statement Thursday that the governor “is supportive” of the bill as well as a companion measure legislators approved Wednesday that will ease the “Zion Curtain” barrier requirements for restaurants that serve alcohol.
“He doesn't have an expected signing timeline yet, except that he must sign within 20 days of the session adjourning (on Thursday),” Rappleye wrote.
The DUI bill has also raised the hackles of alcohol-friendly opponents who have already been long at odds with the state's existing .08 percent BAC limit.
Utah maintains a reputation as antagonistic to alcohol drinkers because of the teetotaling practices of the state's Mormon majority, they argue, even though the .08 percent limit has been in force in areas of the country where The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints does not have a significant social influence since the federal government required tying highway funds to the DUI standard more than a decade ago.
American Beverage Institute Managing Director Sarah Longwell said in a statement to the Associated Press on Wednesday night that the proposal will do little to make roads safer because more than 77% of alcohol-related traffic deaths in Utah come from drivers with a blood-alcohol content of 0.15 and above.
"Utah legislators missed an opportunity ... to target the hard-core drunk drivers who cause the vast majority of drunk driving fatalities and instead decided to criminalize perfectly responsible behavior," Longwell said.
The intended result?
Mark Baruffi, the owner of Cedar City's Centro Woodfired Pizza, said he expects a lowered limit to have a negative impact on his business, which is popular with out-of-town visitors including those who come for the Utah Shakespeare Festival.
“It makes it that much harder for people to make the decision to even purchase that one drink,” Baruffi said. “It's not our job to be the conscience of a customer or monitor their drinking. If anything, I don't see what the point of it is. Are (officials) trying to increase state revenue from DUIs? Now they know that they can watch any restaurant that serves alcohol and have a pretty good chance of any customer that leaves for a DUI. … It's a law that I think reflects negatively on the state more than any of the other things that have gone on with the liquor laws here.”
Maria Twitchell, the director of the Cedar City-Brian Head Tourism Bureau, said visitation may be negatively affected but officials are waiting to see what the real impact may be.
“We are concerned because it's the lowest in the country and we're trying to be good hosts in a national and international market,” Twitchell said. “There's concern that, because it's so low, even food sales might be affected. A reduction in drinking will lead to a reduction in food sales. That can affect our tax base as we rely on food sales.”
But the bill's backers say the measure isn't about frustrating those who drink, it's about protecting the state's drivers. Other people on the road who are drug-impaired may already be practicing illegal behavior by taking those substances, but alcohol is legally available to adults.
Sending the right message
Rep. Norm Thurston, R-Provo, who sponsored the measure in the state's House of Representatives, said the limit is important because a person starts to become impaired with the first drink.
"That's the problem with our current law – it sends the message that you can drink up to a certain point and then drive," Thurston said Wednesday.
He notes a number of foreign countries have blood-alcohol content thresholds at .05 or lower. And the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration states a driver with a blood-alcohol content of .05 percent may have trouble steering and have a harder time coordinating, tracking moving objects and responding to emergencies.
“"That's the problem with our current law – it sends the message that you can drink up to a certain point and then drive."”

Support for the Labour Party has dipped below 10%, according to the latest opinion poll.
Independents and smaller parties have also lost ground, with Fianna Fáil benefitting.
The Millward Brown poll for tomorrow's Sunday Independent also found that just one voter in five is satisfied with the Government's performance.
The poll of 985 voters was conducted over ten days finishing last Thursday.
It will be published just two weeks since its last poll for the Sunday Independent.
There is a very high level of 'undecideds' - 32% - but when they are excluded, Fine Gael is up one to 25%.
While the slide in Labour support continues - the party is down two to just 9%.
Fianna Fáil is back in the lead, up six points to 29%; while Sinn Féin drops one to 20%; and Independents and others are down four points in two weeks to 17%
Just 20% - one in five - say they are satisfied with the way the Government is running the country; 74% are dissatisfied.
Among the party leaders, 26% are satisfied with the performance of the Fine Gael Taoiseach, 17% with the Labour Tánaiste, 36% with Fianna Fáil's Micheál Martin, and 28% with Gerry Adams of Sinn Féin.
The larger problem with ethics questions involving Ginni Thomas is the Supreme Court has no way to address them
Mother Jones is out with a new story about a group of prominent conservatives, including the wife of Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, meeting weekly to plan a “30-front war seeking to fundamentally transform the nation,” according to documents obtained by the magazine.
The group calls itself “Groundswell” and meets weekly, like many other groups that strategize in Washington. But this story is notable for the conflict-of-interest questions it raises around Thomas' wife, Virginia “Ginni” Thomas.
“At its weekly meetings, the group aims to strengthen the right's messaging by crafting Twitter hashtags; plotting strategy on in-the-headlines issues such as voter ID, immigration reform, and the sequester; promoting politically useful scandals; and developing “action items.”
Not all those issues have or will come before the Supreme Court. And spouses of elected officials and prominent Washingtonians are entitled to professional lives of their own.
But the problem here is that there is no way to resolve or address some of the questions that David Corn raises about Ginny Thomas since the Supreme Court has no binding code of ethics, no rules for handling such thorny issues.
Common Cause for the last several years has been urging the Supreme Court to create an ethics code. There is plenty of evidence it's needed. Common Cause argued a few years ago that Justice Thomas had a conflict of interest when he participated in the Citizens United case because Ginni Thomas at that time was running a conservative nonprofit fighting the “tyranny” of President Obama that directly benefited from removing limits on corporate and union spending on politics. That was clearer cut because Ginni benefited financially from the Citizens United decision.
It's not just the Thomases raising questions. Justice Antonin Scalia has spoken at a number of political gatherings when judges are not supposed to participate in political events. In fact, Charles and David Koch boasted that Scalia attended one of their now-famous political strategy sessions in the California desert.
These questions deserve answers, and the Supreme Court should have a way to handle them.

French President François Hollande on Monday called for the United States and Russia to join his country in an all-out war against ISIS — but President Obama expressed a much less aggressive stance, and said putting more US troops on the ground “would be a mistake.”
In a role reversal from the 2003 US war against Iraq, which France opposed, Hollande told French lawmakers he is committed to “destroying” ISIS, “a result that has been too long in coming.”
Speaking at a rare joint session of Parliament at the Palace of Versailles, Hollande said he wanted to create “a union of all who can fight this terrorist army in a single coalition.”
“I will call both Obama and [Russian President Vladimir] Putin to unite our efforts and seek a solution,” Hollande said.
Obama, however, flatly rejected Hollande's plea to ramp up the US military effort, instead defending his own strategy of targeted airstrikes and aiding anti-ISIS fighters.
Responding to a reporter who asked, “Why can't we take out these bastards?,” Obama said that deploying 50,000 American soldiers could oust ISIS from its strongholds in Syria and Iraq, but wouldn't stop it from mounting attacks in other countries.
Obama also said the idea of imposing a “no-fly zone” was well-intentioned but unworkable, claiming, “It's best that we don't shoot first and aim later.”
In a jab at Republicans who blasted his approach in the wake of Friday's deadly ISIS attacks in Paris, Obama said he wouldn't do anything “just to make America look tough, or make me look tough.”
“If folks want to pop off and have opinions about what they think they would do, present a specific plan,” he said at the close of the G-20 summit meeting in Antalya, Turkey.
“If they think that somehow, their advisers are better than the chairman of my Joint Chiefs of Staff and the folks who are actually on the ground, I want to meet them.”
In other developments:
A new ISIS video threatened further attacks across Europe and in the US capital. “We say to the states that take part in the crusader campaign that, by God, you will have a day, God willing, like France's and by God, as we struck France in the center of its abode in Paris, then we swear that we will strike America at its center in Washington,” vowed a fighter identified as “Al Ghareeb the Algerian.”
French warplanes again launched airstrikes against ISIS in Raqqa, Syria, hitting seven sites.
French officials said police exercising emergency powers had conducted 168 raids since Sunday night, arresting 127 people and confiscating 31 weapons. The seizures included a Kalashnikov assault rifle and a rocket launcher.
Following a nationwide minute of silence at noon, several of Paris' landmarks, including the Eiffel Tower, reopened.
In Turkey, Putin spoke cryptically about his private, 30-minute meeting with Obama on Sunday. “We proposed cooperation on antiterrorism; unfortunately our partners in the United States in the initial stage responded with a refusal,” Putin said, according to the Wall Street Journal.“But life indeed moves on, often very quickly, and teaches us lessons. It seems to me that everyone is coming around to the realization that we can wage an effective fight only together.” And in a sign the Russian president is no longer considered a pariah by Western leaders, Putin revealed that British Prime Minister David Cameron had shared intelligence about the suspected bombing of a Russian airliner that crashed in Egypt on Oct. 31. Cameron, who spoke privately with Putin for an hour on Monday, told the BBC that the West was willing to compromise with Russia over a deal to end the Syrian civil war.
Meanwhile, Obama on Monday reaffirmed his administration's pledge to take in 10,000 Syrian refugees, but he met staunch resistance from nearly half the US governors following the revelation that at least one Paris attacker had sneaked into France with a group of refugees. The list of dissenting governors — which by Monday evening swelled to at least 24 and which was made up almost entirely of Republicans, according to the Washington Post — includes Bobby Jindal of Louisiana, John Kasich of Ohio and Chris Christie of New Jersey, who said he'd even reject “3-year-old orphans.”New Hampshire Gov. Maggie Hassan, who is challenging Republican Sen. Kelly Ayotte, was the first Democrat to join the group.
New York Republican Rep. Chris Collins and GOP Assemblyman Christopher Friend are urging Gov. Andrew Cuomo to bar Syrian refugees from the Empire State, citing the threat of terrorism.
The NYPD added 100 cops to its counterterrorism unit, the first step in a plan to beef up its ranks to combat Islamist extremists in the wake of Paris.

I was walking through a parking lot the other day and I saw at least 8 shopping carts that the previous user did not return to the store or cart return area. This is something that has been bothering me for weeks – why do people think it's ok to not return their carts? I think when you use a cart, you have a responsibility to use it properly and return it when you're done.
I posted a question about it on Facebook and I was shocked when the first 4 commenters admitted that they regularly don't return their carts. These were their excuses in a nutshell:
I have my kids with me. I physically can't walk that far. By leaving my cart out, I'm keeping a clerk/cart attendant employed. If the cart return is more than a few spaces away, I'm not going to use it.
I don't buy any of those excuses.
Take your kids with you to return your cart or lock them in the car for the 1-2 minutes it takes you to return the cart. If the kid is old enough, make the kid return it for you. The store will assign a clerk to assist you to your car, load your groceries, and take your cart back for you upon request. Bullshit – The store will still employ a clerk to collect the carts from cart returns. Are you fucking kidding me?
My mother had me 21 months after giving birth to twins. I called her and she said she always returns her cart. If she can shop with 3 babies and not leave a cart in the middle of the parking lot, you would be hard pressed to find a valid reason (besides an extreme emergency) for not returning your cart.
This problem and all the comments on my Facebook page about this issue made me wonder what's the underlying issue here. Is it laziness? Entitlement? Selfishness? Thoughtlessness?
How would you feel if your car was dented by a rogue shopping cart that was blown into your car by a strong gust of wind?
How would you feel if the teenage clerk got hit by a car while retrieving the cart you failed to put away?
Shopping carts are expensive. When they're damaged they need to be replaced. Stores pass that cost along to you. Don't bitch about the cost of groceries if you're part of the problem.
My obvious reaction to this problem is to scream “Put your fucking cart away!” but I think the bigger challenge is to address the pervasive underlying problem and ask how do we create a community where people think beyond the immediate moment and consider the greater good for themselves and others?
The actor has quite a wide-ranging resume, and we're looking back at some of his most well-known roles.
Alexis Denisof Goes From Fighting Vampires With Buffy To Being A Father On 'Finding Carter'
Paula Abdul made a valid point with her 1988 mega hit "Opposites Attract." Where Elizabeth Wilson (played by Cynthia Watros) is a strong-willed, sometimes stubborn, mother on the new MTV series "Finding Carter," her other, more loveable, half comes in the form of her husband David.
Played by the equally beloved Alexis Denisof, David brings a slightly more lighthearted, almost comical, persona to the drama series, which focuses on a teenager named Carter who discovers she was abducted as a toddler. When the girl reconnects with her biological family, she navigates a new life with her true parents and siblings -- and develops a seemingly unbreakable bond with her loving, supportive ol' man.
Accustomed to balancing dramatic characters with lighter fare, Alexis got his film start in England with the Royal Shakespeare Company following graduation from the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Arts. After appearing in various British films, television movies and stage productions, his big break came with the introduction of his comedic character Wesley Wyndam-Price in the hit TV series "Buffy The Vampire Slayer."
Alexis met his now-wife, Alyson Hannigan, on the set of "Buffy" shortly before his character earned a recurring role on the "Buffy" spinoff "Angel." It was there that Wesley turned darker and more dramatic, perhaps readying Alexis for his role as mysterious villain The Other in Marvel Comics' 2012 film "The Avengers."
True to his earlier days playing a kooky member of the Watchers' Council on "Angel," Alexis also played the goofy, recurring role of Sandy Rivers, a philandering news anchor on "How I Met Your Mother," which also starred his wife.
Most recently, Alexis returned to his Shakespeare roots with a starring role in Joss Whedon's film, "Much Ado About Nothing," where he played solemn, yet witty, Benedick. Catch Alexis in action as Carter's dad in the series premiere of "Finding Carter" tomorrow at 10/9c!
If you bought a Powerball ticket with the numbers 1, 6, 7, 20, and 49 with a Powerball of 23 on or just before August 25 of last year at Playland Market in Rye, N.Y., you bought a winning ticket for $1 million.
But you'll have to hurry. The deadline to claim the prize is Sunday, and if no one steps forward, the money goes back into the lottery's prize pool, to be claimed by future potential winners.
It won't be for lack of trying on Playland Market owner Ralph Alfalahi's part. USA Today reports that Alfalahi's posted a sign with the winning numbers on it in his shop window in the hope that someone will have his or her memory jogged.
"I have no idea who it was," Alfalahi told the paper. "I wish I knew."
New York Lottery spokeswoman Christy Calicchia says that $28 million in lottery prizes have gone unclaimed in the first four months of this year. In 2012, a total of $65 million was left on the table by forgetful players. According to Calicchia, some players put the ticket through the wash, forget they bought it in the first place, or don't realize when there's more that one drawing prize.
For the record, the winnings amount to $662,000 after state and federal taxes, and wouldn't come close to the biggest unclaimed prize in New York lottery history. That honor goes to a $68 million Mega Millions ticket sold in Brooklyn in 2002.

Fathers4Justice today said they believe they have been blocked from speaking at a meeting in Parliament this Tuesday on ‘The Changing Role of Fathers', being chaired by the Right Revered, Paul Butler, Bishop of Durham.
Fathers4Justice had been scheduled as speaking at the event organised by the Party Parliamentary Group for Parents and Families. They were informed last week that ‘due to timings' there was no space for them after ‘Ministers' were confirmed as attending. It is believed the Minister concerned is former Family Law Barrister and Under Secretary of State for Children and Families, Edward Timpson MP.
The organisers refused to respond to enquiries from Fathers4Justice whether their removal was down to political pressure or whether other groups had also been removed from the schedule.
Said F4J Campaign Director, Nadine O'Connor, “We are deeply saddened that yet again, the families we represent have been denied a voice in their own Parliament. We have raised the issue with the organisers and the Bishop of Durham, but to date we have had no response.”
“The only conclusion we can draw, is that as on countless previous occasions over the last 14 years, we have again been denied an opportunity to present our case and oral testimony because of political pressure.
“We know from sources in Westminster that the Conservative Party have stated they will oppose Fathers4Justice at every opportunity as a result of the toxic fallout from their broken election promises to introduce Shared Parenting.”
“Not only is this suffocation of legitimate views and matters of great public interest wholly unacceptable, but it is an affront to our democratic principles.”
Those that wish to raise their concerns should contact the Bishop of Durham can do so as follows:

It's dinner time. Villain Richmond Valentine (Samuel L. Jackson), flaunting his disarming lisp, confesses his love of good old-fashioned spy movies to debonair secret agent Henry Hart (Colin Firth). At the same time, he somewhat paradoxically reassures Hart that this isn't one of them, coming within inches of breaking the fourth wall. This odd contradiction wonderfully summarises the action packed, self-referential romp that is Matthew Vaughn's latest film, Kingsman: The Secret Service, an adaptation of Mark Millar's graphic novel of the same name.
Vaughn channels the tongue-in-cheek swagger of his own films – Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels (1998) and Snatch (2000), where he produced, and Kick-Ass (2010), which he co-wrote and directed – but Kingsman is most indebted to post-modernist masters Edgar Wright and Simon Pegg. Watching Kingsman you can't help but be reminded of the duo's very British action-comedy Cornetto Trilogy. Just as Shaun of The Dead brought the zombie apocalypse into contemporary England and Hot Fuzz an the explosive police thriller into the quaint rural countryside, Kingsman reinvents the classic James Bond-style spy movie in a world of iPhones, hoodies and Iggy Azalea.
Old and new clash as dapper Kingsman special agent Harry Hart (Colin Firth), channelling the best of Bonds Roger Moore and Sean Connery with his pinstripe suit and conservative British values, finds a new protégé in the inner city: working class ruffian Eggsy (Taron Egerton). This central relationship not only anchors the film, but also epitomises Vaughn's desire to pay homage to much loved spy films of the past while injecting the genre with a burst of modernity. This dynamic is perfectly, albeit unsubtly, depicted when Eggsy nicknames his pet pug “J.B.” for Jack Bauer rather than James Bond, much to elder statesmen Michael Caine's surprise and disapproval.
This juxtaposition of tradition and modernity is one of Kingsman's great strengths; it makes the film accessible and enjoyable for young and old audiences. Nods to classic Bond elements, like Rosa Klebb's shoe knife from From Russia with Love and other convoluted villainous plots to dispatch of the hero will please old school fans.
Alternatively, the villainous Valentine is a thoroughly 21st century baddie. He's made his fortune in social media, à la Mark Zuckerberg, and regularly chows down on Big Macs for dinner. Even the soundtrack gets in on the old/new act as Lynyrd Skynyrd and Dire Straits rub shoulders with Dizzie Rascal's banging hit “Bonkers.” With such an eclectic formula, it's impossible for the film not to venture into the absurd – an avenue that provides Kingsman's most memorable moments.
Like Kick-Ass, Kingsman loves a good action sequence. There are glimpses of frenetic, beautifully choreographed fist fights throughout the film, but it's not until national treasure Colin Firth finds himself in a Westboro Baptist Church lookalike, hounded by ravenous extremists, that these scenes really kick off.
Spurred by Valentine's psychosis-inducing SIM cards, Firth, in an immaculate suit and tie, battles everyone in the church. In one dizzying take, Firth shoots, clobbers and bludgeons everything in sight with blood and guts spurting everywhere. Rather than conventionally depict the frantic action with quick, chopping edits, George Richmond's cinematography unblinkingly follows Firth's every more to give us a breathless view of the chaotic melee.
It's one of the most brilliantly exhilarating fight scenes I've ever seen; the the scale and mayhem resembles something out of a video game more than anything else. The fact that this rather unassuming British gent is the one dishing out the beatings is the cherry on top. These fights scenes come thick and fast towards the end, however, and while impressively innovative and dynamic, they become literally exhausting to watch.
Not quite as impressive as the action is the script, where the comedy lacks the deadly efficiency of Firth wheedling his inconspicuously dangerous umbrella. Goldman and Vaughn's script is a real hit-and-miss affair as too often the jokes resort to crudely constructed swearing and sex gags. At one point a princess offers Eggsy the chance to “f**k her in the ass” if he saves the world. Who said romance was dead? At times like this, the script's try-hard bravado unfolds as if it were written by a horny teenager boasting to his pre-pubescent mates about an entirely fabricated sexual encounter.
Taron Egerton puts on his best East Landan twang as working-class boy done good, Eggsy. While his character is a predictably stereotypical portrayal of an urban kid, complete with a varsity jacket, baseball cap and joy riding antics, it works on the wider provision that he's the polar opposite to Harry Hart.
Hart's the real star, anyway; not only does Firth encapsulate the historical ideal of a suave English spy brilliantly, but he also revels in both the physical and comic demands placed on him. The ambidextrous nature of his performance is encapsulated superbly when, after dispatching some ill-mannered thugs in the pub, he calmly dusts himself off, sits back down and sips his Guinness amongst the crumpled bodies.
Firth's comic timing, along with fellow spy Merlin (Mark Strong), is spot on. They draw from their ample acting experience to deliver the bulk of the laughs. In tune with the golden oldies, Samuel L. Jackson is at his daftest, most eccentric best to make Valentine not just a memorable villain, but a memorable role in the actor's career.
Outrageous, absurd, exhilarating, Kingsman is a royally raucous and enjoyable romp. Comedy, blistering action and a couple of excellent performances once again see Matthew Vaughn invigorating a tired genre. We'll always have 007 leading the line for serious cinematic espionage, but with Eggsy and the Kingsman, we've got a rambunctious alternative well worth taking a joy ride with.

In an event focused on gun-violence prevention in February in Columbia, S.C., Democratic presidential front-runner Hillary Clinton appeared with mothers who have lost children to gun violence. (Melina Mara/The Washington Post)
The generation of African Americans pushing criminal-
justice issues and institutional racism to the forefront of the presidential election had little effect at the ballot box during this primary season, according to an analysis of exit polling across 25 states.
African Americans account for a larger share of Democratic primary voters this year than they did in 2008, but that is because of older black voters, not higher ­participation by younger black people.
Across two dozen states where exit polls were conducted in 2008 and this year, black voters older than 45 grew from 12 percent of the electorate on average in 2008 to 16 percent this year. In those same states, black voters younger than 45 made up 11 percent of voters in 2008 vs. 10 percent this year.
President Obama, in his commencement address last weekend at Howard University, praised young black activists for bringing new energy to the ongoing movement for racial justice and equality, but he said: “You have to have a strategy. Not just awareness, but action. Not just hashtags, but votes.”
“It's thanks in large part to the activism of young people like many of you, from ‘Black Twitter' to Black Lives Matter, that America's eyes have been opened — white, black, Democrat, Republican — to the real problems, for example, in our criminal-justice system,” Obama said. “But to bring about structural change, lasting change, awareness is not enough. It requires changes in law, changes in custom.”
He added: “Passion is vital, but you've got to have a strategy. And your plan better include voting, not just some of the time, but all the time.”
Obama's comments echoed continuing concerns that some young black activists involved in the current wave of political action do not share the belief in the critical importance of the right to vote — one of the most important achievements of the civil rights movement of the 1950s and '60s.
Democratic candidates and strategists have stressed the importance this year of all young voters, who heavily favored Obama in both of his election contests — and Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont in this year's Democratic primaries. But younger Americans are the least likely to turn out in elections: The share of eligible voters ages 18 to 29 who cast ballots fell from a record high of 48 percent in 2008 to 41 percent in the 2012 presidential election, according to the U.S. Elections Project.
Fredrick Harris, a political science professor and director of the Institute for Research in African American Studies at Columbia University, said the success of the Black Lives Matter movement should not be measured only by voter turnout or candidate preference. It has succeeded at doing what no other black leaders have done, especially those who have lined up to endorse either Sanders or Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton.
The young activists have “placed criminal-justice reform on the political agenda. Both Sanders and Clinton have been falling over each other talking about the need for reform and the persistence of institutionalized racism,” Harris said. “That did not happen in 2008 and would not have happened in 2016 without BLM. A movement does not have to necessarily influence electoral outcomes in order to be successful. Look for criminal-justice reform in the party's platform at this summer's convention, which will prioritize the issue if a Democrat wins [the White House]. There were no serious criminal-justice-reform platform in 2008 or 2012. In essence, the movement has been influential in the Democratic selection process without even officially endorsing a candidate.”
Interviews with some activists inspired by the Black Lives Matter movement revealed a nuanced view of electoral politics. None advocated a total boycott of elections, and some have been actively involved in various local contests across the country.
At the same time, many were not enthusiastic about the value of voting, particularly in this year's presidential election cycle. Some activists have staged protests at campaign events and received ample media coverage in the process. The sharpest criticism was aimed at Clinton, but most did not endorse Sanders, either.
[Clinton heckled by Black Lives Matter activists]
These activists argued that neither candidate had adequately addressed the issues affecting black communities.
“Voting is definitely one way, and I wouldn't insult my ancestors by telling people they shouldn't vote, but there are other ways of reimagining and restructuring the world, and that lies in organizing our communities,” said Ashley Williams, a 23-year-old activist who attends the University of North Carolina at Charlotte.
Williams crashed a fundraiser for Clinton in Charlotte in February, where she stood up and asked the candidate whether she would “apologize to black people for mass incarceration.” Williams also said, “I'm not a ­super-predator, Hillary Clinton” — a reference to Clinton's use years ago of a racially charged term meant to describe young offenders who are beyond rehabilitation. Williams was escorted from the event, but the next day, Clinton told a Washington Post columnist, “Looking back, I shouldn't have used those words, and I wouldn't use them today.”
Williams, who said she joined other protesters in disrupting a Trump rally in Raleigh in December, said she did not endorse Sanders, because “I'm not sure he should be the nominee, either.”
Lindsey Burgess, 22, a student at Spelman College in Atlanta who is supporting Sanders, is concerned that many young African Americans are already disenchanted with politics because of their view that two terms of an Obama presidency have done little to dismantle institutional racism. The rhetoric of the Black Lives Matter movement, she said, risks turning off these would-be voters even more.
“It's very much ideology-driven, and it is anti-establishment,” Burgess said of the movement. “They want to eradicate this whole political system, the two-party system. But that's not feasible right now. I do think that type of language has permeated the [presidential] campaign and stopped a lot of people from getting involved.”
[Sanders has changed how millennials view politics, polls show]
Exit polls show African Americans overwhelmingly supported Clinton over Sanders in this year's primaries and were crucial to fueling her large delegate lead. Clinton won an average of 79 percent support among black Democratic voters, compared with 21 percent for Sanders. Clinton won black voters under age 45 by 33 points across 12 states where exit polls broke down electoral choice by age — and won older voters by a larger 79 points.
Joyce Ladner, who was a member of one of the leading organizations of the civil rights era, the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, said the cynicism toward voting on the part of some young activists is dangerous because “so much is at stake, if not for them, for the masses of black people.”
“What to substitute for not voting? They need to put forth an alternative political, social or economic structure that delivers some relief to black people,” Ladner said. “This is where the critical issue of accountability comes in. To whom are BLM folks accountable when they remove the vote from black people?”
And, she argued, “If voting isn't important, why are white legislators gerrymandering districts and using other tactics to prevent blacks from voting?”
Activists in the Black Lives Matter movement don't always sit on the sidelines. In Chicago, several groups rallied voters to unseat Cook County State's Attorney Anita Alvarez, who they said helped cover up the shooting death in 2014 of Laquan McDonald, the black teenager who was walking away from police officers when one of them shot him 16 times.
[Black Lives Matter activists won one; prosecutors lost]
Authorities did not charge the officer until a year later, prompting allegations of a coverup. Activists launched a campaign dubbed #ByeAnita, and Alvarez, who was seeking a third term, was soundly defeated in the March 15 primary.
Activists in Cleveland similarly organized and turned out voters to oust Cuyahoga County Prosecutor Timothy J. McGinty, who was criticized for his handling of the shooting death in 2014 of Tamir Rice, the 12-year-old who was playing with a toy gun when a police officer shot him to death.
Jessica Pierce, national chair of the Black Youth Project 100, said that Alvarez was directly targeted because she “will use her position of power to support violence against black people.”
The organization did not choose sides in the Democratic primary and has no plans to endorse in the general election, although they will encourage young black people to vote. More important, Pierce said, is educating and organizing black communities to hold elected officials accountable between elections. She said she doesn't take issue with Obama's challenge to young activists.
“For Black Youth Project 100, a core purpose of leading election work is not just the votes that we will turn out in this election but what those votes represent,” Pierce said. “The votes represent power — concrete power of black youth across the country. This is power that then builds into our direct action organizing campaigns and policy work that we have been leading locally and will continue to lead after Election Day.”

Welcome to the 10th episode of Pretty Good. This is a story I've been waiting to tell for years. In the first place, it's one I've wanted to learn about for years. I remember being nine years old, flipping through a Guinness Book of World Records, and devouring the 20-word caption in the "sports records" section that summarized Georgia Tech's 222-0 defeat of Cumberland College. That's all I could get: 20 words. I spent the next two decades wondering what sort of unholy malicious mutant football that could have produced the numbers two hundred and twenty-two, and zero.
I finally found the answers, thanks to a play-by-play account from the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, some old newspaper clippings, and a couple of century-old college yearbooks. Another major source was the book You Dropped It, You Pick It Up by Jim Paul. Sadly, this book appears to have been out of print for decades, but it works off accounts given by players from both teams, and proved to be an invaluable source of reference.
The play-by-play is probably about 95 percent accurate. There are a couple of minor gaps I filled in. (For instance, at one point, the play-by-play says Georgia Tech gained 11 yards over two plays. I split the difference and recorded it as a 6-yard gain, then a 5-yard gain.) Frankly, though, I feel lucky that such complete accounts of a hundred-year-old game exist at all.
Special thanks to the Georgia Tech Archives for material they provided.
One final note: occasionally, teachers reach out to me and ask whether they can show my videos to their classes. The answer is yes, please, and thank you, and I'm honored, and you don't even need to ask. For this reason, I want to point out that unlike some other episodes of Pretty Good, this episode is a rated-G affair. No cussin', no nothin'.
Previously in Pretty Good:
RAT POISON AND BRANDY: THE 1904 ST. LOUIS OLYMPIC MARATHON.
The 1904 Olympic marathon was a story of fraud, thievery, raw eggs, rat poison, food poisoning, liquor, feral dogs, and at least three separate incidents of near-death. it was the stupidest sporting event of all time.
I WISH EVERYONE ELSE WAS DEAD.
24 was the Bush administration's favorite TV show. Jack Bauer's world was also a quasi-apocalyptic nightmare that reduced America to a cathedral of death worship. That is not coincidental.
"NO!!!!!!"
We've all seen multi-lateral desperation trick plays attempted in the NFL. It has only actually worked one time. And the time it worked ... oh no. Ohhhhhhhhhhh no. No, no, no, no, no.
Made in Space team members with their 3-D printer hang on during a zero-g test flight.
3-D printers that could crank out parts for spacecraft and space stations – from wrenches to screws – all while in orbit is becoming one step closer to reality.
A company called Made in Space has completed a successful testing period of two 3-D printers on multiple NASA flights, with a scaled-down wrench becoming the first-ever tool printed in partial zero gravity.
Printing out parts in space could eventually be transplanted to other worlds such as the moon, where it could help human colonies gain a foothold by printing out robot parts or buildings, piece by piece.
The test printing took place on multiple zero-gravity flights provided by NASA's Flight Opportunities Program, which offers opportunities for space technologies to be tested in a relevant environment.Two modified off-the-shelf 3-D printers were tested – one provided by their partner 3-D Systems and another custom-made printer designed to manufacture structures in space.

“We had a fairly good idea that the technology would work in microgravity, but we wanted to know how well it would work,” said Made in Space CEO Aaron Kemmer. “The tests focused on building parts that could be analyzed postflight and compared to similar parts built on Earth.”
Three-dimensional printers allow items to be built layer by layer, similar to how a conventional printer lays ink on paper. The objects are made with thin layers of "feedstock," which can be metal, plastic or a variety of other materials.
Made in Space believes this technology will eventually enable satellites, spacecraft and other large structures to be built in space one day.
Now that Made in Space has a proof of concept, the next step is refining the 3-D printer for use in the constant zero-gravity environment of space.
“Future flights will serve as a test bed for more advanced analysis on the printing process in zero-gravity, as well as learning how to control other issues that may arise in space, such as radiation, temperature control and material processes,” Kemmer told TechNewsDaily.
The company said it plans to have a functional 3-D printer in space within three years.
“Early next year, we will fly the first 3-D printer to space on board a suborbital rocket through NASA's CRuSR program,” Kemmer said. “This test will space-qualify many of the components that we will use on the actual 3-D printer we fly to space.”

A Black princess who saves herself and exposes princess culture? Kids and adults say “Yes!”
An interview with Jeremy Whitley about his race-positive, gender-bending, subversive series for kids, Princeless
Melissa Giraud Blocked Unblock Follow May 25, 2016
What we do to princesses. Princess Adrienne locked in a tower in the first issue of Princeless, illustrated by M. Goodwin
Princeless series [recommended for ages 8+] by Jeremy Whitley (Action Lab Entertainment)
Synopsis: As a young girl Princess Adrienne was already critical of the princess stories her mother read to her. What kind of parents imprison their daughter in a tower? she scoffed. Until one day her parents do imprison her in a tower, as is the custom, so that the brave knight who slays the dragon guarding her can win her hand. But Princess Adrienne doesn't want to be saved or belong to a prince. So she decides to save herself and her seven sisters who are also trapped in towers. When her ruthless father, the king, hears about the “short knight” trying to free the princesses he calls for “his” head. Adventure, suspense and fun ensue. Along the way, we meet others (like her brother, Prince Devon!) who need to go against convention and expectations just to be themselves.
Melissa: Thanks so much for writing the Princeless series! What were you trying to do in regard to race with the story?
Jeremy: In part, I wanted my daughter to be able to see a character that looked like her in the story. I'm white, my wife is black, and my daughter is mixed race. There's already not a lot of representation in comics for girls of color.
Also, I remember my wife and I being kind of excited about “The Princess and The Frog” [Disney's 2009 movie featuring a black princess], and then actually watching it and being hit with, Whoa, this isn't quite what I was looking for!
Disney's “The Princess and the Frog” movie (2009) — we do not recommend!
And that's become a trend with me. Why I write the books I write is I find that I'm looking for something and it doesn't seem to exist. I start working on it and sometimes it turns into a thing, sometimes it doesn't. In the case of Princeless, it's proven to be something that a lot of other people were looking for as well.
Melissa: Why start with Princesses at all; why not a superhero?
Jeremy: A lot of kids like princess stories, they're looking for them whether that's what we want them to read or not. Those kids are bound to read about princesses, they want to read about princesses. So starting with a princess and having her experience the many downsides of her position with the reader was very much something I wanted to try.
Melissa: Seems like you're also trying to attract readers who don't like princesses.
Jeremy: Yeah that's definitely something we had in mind. If you look at the cover for the first [single] issue, it's bright pink. But she's also carrying a sword. We were trying to strike that balance between people that want nothing to do with princess stories and kids who are going to look for the princess stories that can still benefit from an interesting and subversive, important story.
Melissa: So what are you most proud of pulling off with Princeless, or are there specific scenes that you are impressed with, reading them years later?
Jeremy: Actually we started reading it with my 5 year-old daughter recently. I didn't want to push it on her. But she's seen it lying around and brought me the first volume to read to her the other day.
I‘m surprised how well it comes together. Managing to move through the concept of the story in the first issue. Going from, here's what we do to princesses, to Adrienne saving herself.
We engineered Model X to be the safest SUV ever, and today, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) announced that after conducting independent testing, it has awarded Model X a 5-star safety rating in every category and sub-category, making it the first SUV ever to earn the 5-star rating across the board. More than just resulting in a 5-star rating, the data from NHTSA's testing shows that Model X has the lowest probability of injury of any SUV it has ever tested. In fact, of all the cars NHTSA has ever tested, Model X's overall probability of injury was second only to Model S.
Model X performs so much better in a crash than gas-powered SUVs because of its all-electric architecture and powertrain design. The rigid, fortified battery pack that powers Model X is mounted beneath the floor of the vehicle creating a center of gravity so low that Model X has the lowest rollover probability of any SUV on the road. No other SUV has ever come close to meeting and exceeding this rollover requirement.
NHTSA's tests assess both the structure of the vehicle, which must minimize intrusion into the cabin and absorb as much energy as possible, and also the seatbelt and airbag restraint system, which must maximize injury mitigation in the event of a crash. Among the nine subcategories rated by NHTSA, including frontal impact, side impact, and pole impact tests conducted on both the driver and passenger side as well as the rollover test, Model X achieved 5-stars in every category and sub-category. That means that in the event of a serious crash, Model X occupants have an overall 93% probability of walking away without a serious injury – a testament to our commitment to building the safest cars on today's roads.

Questions about Content:
Q: Who is the guy crawling in the road (Hernando)?
A: James Meredith, civil rights activist, first African American student at the University of Mississippi. In 1966 he was shot by a sniper while marching in support of voter registration. AP photographer Jack Thornell won a Pulitzer in 1967 for his photo of Meredith after the shooting.
Q: Does anybody know all the events that those pictures are for? I know a few, but I don't know what all of them are.
A: (thanks to cpt kangarooski)

- Fence to which Matthew Shephard was left to die (Laramie, Wyoming, 1998)
Q: What is 12 angry men about and where is #12? I only count 11.
A: Kind of weird, but there are only 11 actors in that scene of the movie (really, check it out). For some reason the foreman (I think) wasn't included in the shot. If anybody knows more about this, please let me know.
2/12/01 - A couple people have suggested that the foreman was in the bathroom. I don't think so though (have to watch it again to be positive). Either way - this scene is the climax of the whole film, It's still weird if one of the characters is in the bathroom.
Q: Why don't you do one of Kurt Cobain?
A: The topics I chose for the Screenshots were ones that had an enormous impact on me. For some reason I wasn't paying much attention to the news when Kurt Cobain died. This applies to a lot of other events that would have been included if someone else had done the series.
Questions about Form:
Q: I've heard you say that the images on the website are "the real pieces", what does that mean?
A: The images were drawn at 800 x 600, 72 dpi. They were intended for screen resolution - Screenshots.
Q: So, if everything is on the web, what will I see if I go to an exhibition with the screenshots in it?
A: Blow-ups of the screen images. I use a Cymbolic Sciences Lightjet 5000 to make 22.5" x 30" digital C-prints.
Q: Are the prints for sale?
A: There was a limited print edition in 2000, Contact Howard House Contemporary (Seattle) at 206-256-6399 for information.

A: Photoshop 4.0 (pc version). I used an old wacom Artpad II pen as well.
Q: So, how exactly did you make these?
A: Here is a very basic tutorial on how I made the Lee and Jack screenshot.
Democrats and Republicans remain at odds on how to avoid a round of budget cuts so deep and arbitrary that to allow them now could push the economy back into recession. The cuts, known as a sequester, will kick in March 1 unless Republicans agree to President Obama's demand to a legislative package that combines spending reductions and tax increases. As of Thursday, with the deadline a week off, Republicans seemed determined to say no to any new tax increases.
“Spending is the problem,” declared the House speaker, John Boehner. “Spending must be the focus.” Reflecting the views of many of her Republican colleagues, Representative Martha Roby said Wednesday that Mr. Obama “already got his tax increase” as part of the January agreement over the “fiscal cliff” and that no further increases were necessary.
Both are wrong. To reduce the deficit in a weak economy, new taxes on high-income Americans are a matter of necessity and fairness; they are also a necessary precondition to what in time will have to be tax increases on the middle class. Contrary to Mr. Boehner's “spending problem” claim, much of the deficit in the next 10 years can be chalked up to chronic revenue shortfalls from the Bush-era tax cuts, which were only partly undone in the fiscal-cliff deal earlier this year. (Wars and a recession also contributed.) It stands to reason that a deficit caused partly by inadequate revenue must be corrected in part by new taxes. And the only way to raise taxes now without harming the recovery is to impose them on high-income filers, for whom a tax increase is unlikely to cut into spending.
As it happens, those taxpayers are the same ones who benefited most from Bush-era tax breaks and who continue to pay low taxes. Even with recent increases, the new top rate of 39.6 percent is historically low; investment income is still taxed at special low rates; and the heirs of multimillion-dollar estates face lower taxes than at almost any time in modern memory.

CHICAGO — As workers at a window-making plant here prepared to spend a fourth night in the factory they had been told to leave for good, union leaders, bankers and company owners met into the night on Monday but the meetings ended without bringing about an end to the workers' peaceful but increasingly tense occupation of the plant.
The layoff of 250 workers last week at Republic Windows and Doors on the North Side with only three days' warning and without pay the workers say is owed to them had, by Monday, drawn the attention of nearly every politician with a connection to this city, numerous union and workers' rights groups and scores of ordinary people, who arrived at the plant offering families toys, food and money.
Gov. Rod R. Blagojevich, who met with the workers Monday morning, said the State of Illinois was suspending its business with the Bank of America, Republic Windows' lenders, and that the Illinois Department of Labor was poised to file a complaint over the plant closing if need be. Political leaders on the Chicago City Council and in Cook County threatened similar actions. Representative Luis V. Gutierrez said he was encouraging the Department of Labor and the Department of Justice to investigate. “Families are already struggling to keep afloat,” Mr. Blagojevich said.
Workers here say they blame the operators of Republic Windows and Doors, a manufacturing company that was founded in 1965, for giving them just three days' notice before closing last Friday, with no earlier hints to the employees that orders for vinyl windows and sliding doors had fallen off.

Late Monday, the company released a statement that indicated that it had known since at least mid-October that it intended to close the factory by January. The statement suggested that it had gone back and forth with Bank of America for more than a month, but that the bank had rejected several of its “wind down” plans as well as the company's request for financing to pay workers' owed vacation.

Academics and artists sign open letter saying university's actions against student protesters are 'at odds with freedom of speech'
Noam Chomsky and Ken Loach are among a host of academics, artists and politicians to condemn the suspension of five university students who took part in a protest on their campus.
In an open letter, signed by 40 people and published by the Guardian, they criticised the University of Birmingham's actions as being "at odds with freedom of speech". They demanded the immediate reinstatement of the students, who were among 13 arrested during the demonstration at the university last month.
"We believe that the suspensions seen at the University of Birmingham are further evidence of the contempt for freedom of expression, both political and academic, in the contemporary university," they wrote.
The signatories, also include former secretary of state for international development and Birmingham MP Clare Short, who said: "These suspensions are at odds with freedom of speech and the right to protest, setting a threatening precedent for how dissent is dealt with on campuses across the country.
"We condemn these suspensions in the strongest terms and call for the immediate reinstatement of the students affected."
Their intervention comes amid growing tensions between student activists and the management in some universities, who have clashed over what the protesters called the "marketisation of education". The protesters want to see an end to cuts and privatisations of university services, and a return to free access to education.
The Defend Education Birmingham activists who occupied part of Birmingham University's campus said they were part of a peaceful protest and were unlawfully kettled by police, who demanded their personal details in exchange for release. But the university argued that their protest was not peaceful and caused damage to property. West Midlands police have also insisted that the protesters were detained as part of a criminal investigation, not kettled.
Deborah Hermann, 21, who studies European politics, society and economics was one of the students suspended, along with Simon Furse, 22, Kelly Rogers, 21, Emily Farmer, 20 and Pat Grady, 21. She said the university's stance "shows the wider picture; the repression of the protest shows why the protest is so important".
She added: "It is unjust, I have been treated very unfairly. I know the university doesn't care about me, they just want to intimidate students. They always put out statements saying that they really support peaceful and legitimate action, but they don't in practice.
"They try to stop any kind of protest. Anything we do, they call it illegitimate. Instead, they have just repressed us. In 1968, students occupied the same Great Hall as us. It was emotional, but incredibly frustrating to be there doing the same. Then the police came. It is clear the university doesn't care about our opinions whatsoever."
Edd Bauer, a campaigner with the National Campaign Against Fees and Cuts, said: "The reason we see oppression is because [the university management's] ideological positions are weakly supported. They have no choice but to resort to the stick. It is their only answer because they have no political argument.
"The university is telling people not to protest and threatening them. Their message is that anyone who wants to protest, anyone who wants to occupy buildings, 'We will have you arrested, we will suspend you and cut you off from education.' We are seeing that all over the country.
He said that the student movement he is part of is protesting against "more corporate universities".
In 2012, the University of Birmingham was criticised by human rights groups – including Amnesty International – over an injunction it sought to pre-emptively ban protests. Its actions were described as "criminalising" sit-in protests and were called aggressive and censorious by Amnesty, Liberty and Index on Censorship.
A University of Birmingham spokesman said the institution respects the right to protest peacefully and within the law and said that students have a "variety of ways" of making their concerns known.
The spokesman said: "Whilst peaceful protest is part of university life, the university will not tolerate behaviour that causes harm to individuals, damage to property or significant disruption to our university community."
The spokesman added the Defend Education Birmingham demonstration "included defacing buildings and property, throwing smoke bombs and fireworks, smashing down doors, damaging historic buildings including Aston Webb and the Old Joe clock tower, and injuring staff".
Slain BART cop told wife to sue if anything happened to him
Veteran BART police officer Tom "Tommy" Smith was shot and killed by another BART officer on Tuesday Jan. 21, 2014 in Dublin, Calif.

BART police Sgt. Tom Smith, frustrated that his department had rejected his requests for more training or the use of its SWAT team during high-risk searches of homes, told his wife that if anything happened to him, she should “sue the s—” out of the agency, her attorneys said Monday.
Specifically, Smith told his wife — fellow BART Officer Kellie Smith — that she should file a lawsuit naming Deputy Police Chief Ben Fairow, whom he said had routinely denied his requests for more training and for tactical teams. Last year, the sergeant was shot and killed — accidentally, authorities said, by a fellow officer who suddenly encountered him as they searched a small Dublin apartment.
The lawsuit Kellie Smith filed on Friday came a day after she wrote a letter to the BART board of directors and Police Department managers, saying the litigation came only after her attempts to “confidentially address my concerns” failed. A veteran of the force for nearly 20 years, she said she wrote the letter “with deep regret and a heavy heart,” noting that she has “deep loyalty to BART PD and its officers.”
The suit, filed in U.S. District Court in San Francisco, says Fairow “denied training and denigrated officers when training and/or involvement of tactical teams were discussed,” saying that it was all “bull—” and that officers were “pussies” because they had “training like this in the police academy.”
“As a result of these repeated denials, my husband said to me, ‘If anything happens to me, I want you to sue the s— out of BART and Fairow.' ” Kellie Smith wrote in her letter. “My husband's words will stay with me forever. I cannot let this situation and his concern for his fellow officers go unanswered.”
On Jan. 21, 2014, BART police Officer Michael Maes mistook his supervisor for an armed suspect during the search of the small Dublin apartment, authorities said. The officers had failed to study the circular floor plan before the search, and suddenly encountered each other in a back room.
The suit seeks unspecified damages and an injunction barring BART from “forcing employees to perform tactical operations without having the requisite training” when there is a safety risk. It names the transit agency, Chief Kenton Rainey, Fairow and Maes as defendants. Maes has declined to discuss the case.
In a statement, Dana Fox, an attorney for the transit agency, said, “The BART family continues to mourn the loss of Sgt. Tommy Smith. BART's top priority is the safety of their officers and the public. The shooting was a tragedy that occurred despite the training the officers had received, which far exceeded (the state Commission on Peace Officer Standards and Training) standards.”
Fairow, a veteran of the Oakland Police Department who joined BART in 2011, has not responded to a request for comment. But in an interview weeks after the tragedy, he said he was “not rejecting” assertions that he routinely declined to deploy the SWAT team. “There very well may have been instances where I said no,” he said.
Smith and Maes were among a group of BART officers who went to the ground-floor, 723-square-foot apartment at the Park Sierra complex on Dougherty Road to conduct a probation search in hopes of recovering stolen property. The apartment belonged to 20-year-old John Henry Lee, a robbery suspect who was already in custody, having been arrested five days earlier after police said he led San Leandro officers on a chase to Oakland in a car stolen from a BART parking lot.

Jann Wenner tried his hand at other magazines over the decades, including the outdoor lifestyle magazine Outside and Family Life. But it was Rolling Stone that helped guide, and define, a generation.
“Who lives through the '60s, '70s, '80s and '90s and cannot be somehow wistful at this moment?” said Terry McDonell, a former top editor at Rolling Stone who also ran other Wenner magazines.
Rolling Stone filled its pages with pieces than ran in the thousands of words by standard bearers of the counterculture, including Hunter S. Thompson — whose “Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas” was published in the magazine in two parts — and Tom Wolfe. It started the career of the celebrity photographer Annie Leibovitz, who for many years delivered electrifying cover images, including an iconic photograph in 1981 of a naked John Lennon curled in a fetal position with Yoko Ono.
Music coverage in all of its forms — news, interviews, reviews — was the core of Rolling Stone, but its influence also stretched into pop culture, entertainment and politics. A bastion of liberal ideology, the magazine became a required stop for Democratic presidential candidates — Mr. Wenner has personally interviewed several, including Bill Clinton and Barack Obama — and it has pulled no punches in its appraisal of Republicans. In 2006, Rolling Stone suggested George W. Bush was the “worst president in history.” More recently, the magazine featured Justin Trudeau, the prime minister of Canada, on its cover with the headline, “Why Can't He Be Our President?”
The magazine also published widely acclaimed political stories, including one in 2009 on Goldman Sachs by the writer Matt Taibbi, who famously described the company as “a great vampire squid wrapped around the face of humanity.” The next year, the magazine ran a piece with the headline, “The Runaway General,” that ended the career of Gen. Stanley A. McChrystal.
When news of the FIFA investigation into Pogba's transfer broke, many were wondering why it was Juventus under scrutiny and not agent Mino Raiola.
In particular, the bianconeri fans were interested in knowing what the outcome would be and if Juventus would be punished with any sanctions.
Milan fans, who are irate over the ‘Donnarumma saga' and have declared war with Raiola, also want to know how Raiola has escaped further scrutiny.
According to the Daily Mail, any possible repercussions against Raiola would depend on the Italian Football Federation taking action in event of any findings against Juventus.
A FIFA spokesman explained: “Speaking in general terms, only the associations are responsible for the potential impositions of sanctions to intermediaries that infringe the regulations on working with intermediaries outlined in article nine.”
Article nine states: ‘Associations are responsible for the imposition of sanctions on any party under their jurisdiction that violates the provisions of these regulations, their statutes or regulations.
‘Associations are obliged to publish accordingly and to inform FIFA of any disciplinary sanctions taken against any intermediary. The FIFA Disciplinary Committee will then decide on the extension of the sanction to have worldwide effect in accordance with the FIFA Disciplinary Code.'
Juventus director Giuseppe Marotta is not concerned:
“It was a transfer with very high numbers, so it's only natural there was an investigation. We acted in full respect of the rules, replied to the FIFA questions and are confident there will be no disciplinary action.”
Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte (pictured) has already said he would not form a coalition with his adversary, far-right MP Geert Wilders (AFP Photo/Lex VAN LIESHOUT)
The Hague (AFP) - The Dutch electoral committee on Friday fired the starting gun on next month's hotly contested elections, revealing a stunning 28 parties will jostle for votes.
A total of 81 parties -- from the establishment ruling Liberals of Prime Minister Mark Rutte to the more colourful such as the Pirate Party -- had registered to take part.
But the electoral committee revealed Friday that most had not met the criteria to do battle for a share of the 150-seat lower house of parliament.
"Twenty-eight parties will be taking part in the parliamentary elections on March 15," the committee announced.
The Dutch news agency ANP said it would set a post-World War II record, as the largest number of parties to compete in elections previously was in 1922, when there were 53 on the ballot.
The candidates will be seeking to woo some 12.6 million eligible Dutch voters, kicking off a key year of elections in Europe -- with presidential polls due in France in the spring and elections later in the autumn in Germany.
Amid the turbulence created by Donald Trump's surprise victory in the US elections and the rise of far-right and populist parties on the continent, the European votes will be closely watched as a bellwether for the continent's future political landscape.
Far-right anti-Islam MP Geert Wilders and his Freedom Party (PVV) have been leading the Dutch opinion polls for months, leaving Rutte's Liberal party (VVD) trailing in second place.
A poll aggregate on Wednesday predicted Wilders would emerge with the largest party with 27-31 seats, with Rutte's party mustering just 23-27 seats.
Rutte's ruling coalition partners the Labour Party(PvdA) has seen its support drain away in recent months with the polls suggesting it may only win between 10 to 14 seats.
Such a result would see the largest parties scrabbling to cobble together the 76-seat majority needed to form a government.
Many parties have already ruled out any collaboration with Wilders, who has vowed to close mosques, ban the Koran and take The Netherlands out of the EU.
And analysts are predicting a period of intense haggling to form the next government, which may even lead to a five-party coalition, giving some of the country's smaller parties a souped-up kingmaker role.

Bill Cosby is eager to get back to work now that his sexual assault case has ended in a mistrial, and the disgraced comedian already has a tour in the works according to his spokesperson.
Andrew Wyatt appeared on Good Day Alabama on Wednesday, and announced that the 79-year-old actor plans to host a series of town halls educating teenagers, young athletes and even married men about how to avoid being charged with a sex crime.
It was then revealed by Wyatt that one of those town halls would be taking place 'some time in July' in Birmingham.
Wyatt appeared on the show along with Camille Cosby's spokesperson and fellow Alabama native Ebonee Benson in their first televised interview since the case ended in a mistrial on Saturday.
At one point, the host of the show, Janice Rogers, said of these proposed town halls: 'Is it sort of do as I say not as I do thing?'
The reference to Cosby's infidelities with a number of other women and admission to giving some of those women Quaaludes caused both Wyatt and Benson to burst out in laughter.

From trial to teacher: Bill Cosby (above on Saturday) will hold a series of town halls around the country to teach young people about sexual assault
Big news: His spokesperson Andrew Wyatt announced the tour on Wednesday while appearing on 'Good Day Alabama'
Reason: 'The laws are changing, the statute of limitations for victims of sexual assault are being extended, so this is why people need to be educated,' said Ebonee Benson (above)
'We're going to talk to young people because this is bigger than Bill Cosby,' explained Wyatt.
'This issue can affect any young person, especially young athletes of today, and they need to know what they're facing when they're hanging out and partying, when they're doing certain things that they shouldn't be doing.'
He then added: 'And it also affects married men.'
The Montgomery County District Attorney's Office did not respond to a request for comment about Cosby's planned tour.
Benson then hopped in to explain the dangers facing young people when ti comes to the subject of sex crimes.
'The laws are changing, the statute of limitations for victims of sexual assault are being extended, so this is why people need to be educated on a brush against the shoulder,' said Benson.
'Because anything at this point can be considered sexual assault and it is a good thing to be educated about the laws.'
On the topic of law, Wyatt said early in the interview that he was not surprised at all with the verdict in the case.
'[Cosby] has always said, "I don't want people coming in deciding if I'm guilty or innocent. I don't want them to take that stance. I want them to hear the truth,"' said Wyatt.
'And I knew that once they heard the truth it was either going to be a mistrial or a verdict of not guilty.'
He claimed that there were 'so many inconsistencies in Ms. Constand's testimony.'
Wyatt then added: 'She gave a different testimony to the Toronto police department and then to Montgomery County and then to the DA Castor at that time, which is why they decided not to press charges [in 2005].'
He also claimed the 52 hours that the jury tried to come to a verdict last week was the 'longest deliberation ever in the history of Montgomery County'
As for his client, Cosby is doing better than ever according to Wyatt.
'He's great, I talked to him this morning,' said the spokesperson.
'He was excited to go home - and his life was at stake, his freedom was at stake - to go home and spend time with Mrs. Cosby and the children and just celebrate Father's Day'
Giggles: Wyatt broke down in laughter after the host of the show joked about Cosby's past indiscretions (above)
Free: Cosby will be back in court in as soon as four months as the DA attempts to quickly retry the comedian in the case (alleged victim Andrea Constand leaving court on Saturday)
Peas in a pod: Cosby, Wyatt and Benson exiting the Montgomery County Courthouse after his mistrial on Saturday
Cosby was just as happy as he walked out of the courthouse with Wyatt on Saturday, who raised a single fist in the air and declared that the comedian's 'power' was back.
He also quoted Huey P. Newton, the co-founder of the Black Panthers, by stating: 'Power is the ability to define phenomena, and make it act in a desired manner.'
Then, to close it out, he attacked those who represented the women accusing Cosby.
'The jurors, they used their power to speak, and Mr. Cosby's power is back,' said Wyatt.
'So the legacy didn't go anywhere, it has been restored. And for all those attorneys who conspired like Gloria Allred, tell them to go back to law school and take another class.'
Camille Cosby, the comedian's seldom-heard-from wife, also jumped into the fray with a statement of her own, which was read outside the courthouse by Benson and later posted on her husband's Twitter account.
In it , she called District Attorney Steele 'heinously and exploitevly ambitious,' Judge O'Neill 'overtly arrogant and collaborating with the district attorney,' the media as 'blatantly vicious entities that continually disseminated intentional omissions of truths for the primary purpose of greedily selling sensationalism at the expense of a human life.'
She did not attack the accusers, but did label their legal counsel as 'totally unethical.'
Benson spoke about Camille's statement in her interview on Wednesday.
'It was a very direct statement. It was a very truthful and pure statement,' said Benson.
'I think the feedback only came from those who did not come and listen for the evidence for themselves.'
Going hard: Camille Cosby (above last Monday) called District Attorney Steele 'heinously and exploitevly ambitious,' Judge O'Neill 'overtly arrogant and collaborating with the district attorney,'
Welcome aboard: It is unclear when Cosby hired Benson, posting a photo of her back in May after her client gave him a painting (pair above on left)
Benson also said in the interview that Cosby's relationship with Constand, which she states was rape and he describes as a mutual affection, helped him in the case even though it revealed he had cheated on his wife.
'I think [the jury] definitely thought about it, because this case, this trial happened years before we made it into a courtroom,' said Benson.
'This trial sort of played out in the eyes of the media, so public opinion was definitely a factor.'
She went on to say: 'I think seeing Mrs Cosby in the courtroom the day that she did come, on closing arguments, and also hearing that statement from her afterwards, I think that resonated with the jury.
'It took away the celebrity aspect and made them more like regular people.'
Benson then closed out by explaining: 'Everyone has issues in a marriage, everyone has problems in a marriage.'
It is unclear how long Benson has been working with Cosby, with the actor posting a rare photo of himself and the young woman on Twitter back in May after an artist she represented made a portrait for the 'Cosby Show' creator.
Wyatt meanwhile has been by Cosby's side for the past few years.
Cosby wrote about the appearance of Benson and Wyatt on Twitter Wedhnesday afternoon, stating: 'Thank You #GoodDayAlabama #WBRC #FOX6 and the most watched news anchor #JaniceRogers @JANICEROGERS6.'
He followed that up with: '...for having my publicists #AndrewWyatt and #EboneeBenson on your show.'
A Twin Cities couple's decision to scrawl their junior high-like profession of love into a sandstone pillar in Montana could become a national scandal.
Their names now stand etched into Pompeys Pillar, a national monument bearing the 207-year-old signature of one of this nation's most revered explorers, Capt. William Clark of Lewis and Clark fame.
Clark's signature, carved in the stone on July 25, 1806, is roughly three feet away from the new inscription, which includes the Plymouth couple's first names with a “+” in the middle, a heart and the date “10/10/13.”
The discovery of the new carving, made while the site was officially closed during the government shutdown, has prompted a federal investigation that could result in a felony charge against the couple. They are not being named because they have so far not been charged with a crime.
For some Montana residents who live near the Pillar, about 25 miles east of Billings, the law can't move quick enough.
“A lot of people are heartbroken about the vandalism because of the historical value and the meaning of Pompeys Pillar,” said Jonathan Peart, executive director of the nonprofit Friends of Pompeys Pillar.
Capt. William Clark's signature in Pompeys Pillar
In Huntley, Mont., 16 miles from the monument, heartbreak has escalated into anger. Locals at Stroker's Tavern want to see the couple returned to Yellowstone County.
The pair deserve more “than just a slap on the hand,” said Gina Loose, a 51-year-old construction company manager. “They can come do the cleaning. They can come do the restoration. They can do it during the middle of summer when the rattlesnakes are out. See how they like it.”
Scott Eggemeyer, a 46-year-old customer at Stroker's, put down his ribs to fume.
“This is what's wrong with our country today, does these kids don't know a damn thing about what made our country great,'' Eggemeyer said. “They don't even know who Meriwether Lewis was.”
Kristen Lenhardt, a spokeswoman for the federal Bureau of Land Management in Billings, said that Clark left his signature some three weeks after splitting up with Lewis on their legendary journey west. “He stopped and signed the pillar. It's the last physical remaining evidence of Clark's journey,” which began in 1803.
The man accused of the vandalism didn't return a phone message or e-mail Friday.
The couple is in their 20s and fledgling musicians. They entered the park during the recent government shutdown and were seen by a Yellowstone County sheriff's deputy. The deputy warned them that they were trespassing before taking their names and sending them on their way without citing them, said Sheriff's Capt. Bill Michaelis.
Authorities later reviewed video surveillance that showed the two had shrugged off the deputy and warning signs, jumped a rail and “carved their names in the rock,” Michaelis said.
The truth is that our continued use of the English system of measurement was making us an island in a metric sea.
– Gerald Ford, statement upon signing the Metric Conversion Act of 1975 on December 23, 1975
In 1982 President Reagan officially disbanded the 17-member U.S. Metric Board, the government organization charged with “increasing the use” of the metric system in the United States. Reagan did so citing efforts to reduce government spending. Since that time, as a county, we pretty much haven't looked back.
In July of that same year, the Board issued a Summary Report, or as I like to refer to it, “Would you like a side of bitter with that?”
Clearly most of its members were not happy with the Board's dissolution, though this was not, according to various sources—including the report—unanimous. The divisiveness within the Board is revealed through various comments it contains. For instance:
Our country holds dear this spirit of individual independence, liberty, justice and freedom of speech. You will notice that the report reflects this spirit…and different views about the metric system.
– Louis F. Polk, chairman, U.S. Metric Board
As if having people on the board who were not in favor of metric adoption wasn't bad enough, according to the board's chair, there were other obstacles as well, including no real sense of direction:
The resolution stated, in effect, that the Board must maintain an objective stance on metrication—it can neither advocate nor discourage conversion. It soon became evident that voluntary conversion and the Board's policy of neutrality were confusing the American people…
– Louis F. Polk, chairman, U.S. Metric Board
While I cannot speak to everything hinted at in the above statement, since I'm looking back 30 years from the outside, I think it's fair to say that any organization not allowed to take a stand on something it is supposed to help move forward is in deep trouble. No wonder our last major metric system push in this country failed.
The actual 1975 metric adoption act states:
SEC. 3. It is therefore declared that the policy of the United States shall be to coordinate and plan the increasing use of the metric system in the United States and to establish a United States Metric Board to coordinate the voluntary conversion to the metric system.
One of the recommendations in the Board's Summary Report was that “national policy on metric conversion should be reassessed,” as in “should metric-system adoption be optional or compulsory?”
…determine if voluntary metrication is in this country's best interests, if complete or partial conversion should be mandated and if we can compete efficiently in domestic and world markets using two systems of measurement.
– U.S. Metric Board Summary Report
On the anti-mandatory-metric-adoption side, the representative of small business stated (and the bolding is NOT mine):
…Small Business supports voluntary metric conversion activities but will vehemently oppose any attempts by the Federal Government or other groups to impose mandatory conversion.
Interestingly, the representative for the construction industry admits his sector would be loath to convert to metric measures (apparently still true today) but would if forced to do so:
As far as my constituency goes…will, under a voluntary approach, be the very last sector to implement conversion to metric measurement—if at all. However, based on my study of progress in the other English-speaking nations and my knowledge of the constructor and designer mentality, I believe that conversion, if mandated with a reasonable schedule, would be virtually a non-event. My industry would adapt very readily, as the hallmark of construction is change, and to us change is an everyday occurrence.
Wrote the representative for business and industry:
I would urge that Congress explicitly set the goal of predominant use of the metric system in the trade and commerce of the United States, and make that a real national commitment by setting a target date…The fact of setting a date will provide the reality required for all sectors of our society to produce effective conversion programs.
Many of the pro-metric representatives expressed hope that progress made toward metric adopt would continue and our country would—eventually—join the rest of the metric-using world:
Tact, patience, and education will erode the anti-metric fortress.
– State and local government representative
Well, it's been more than 30 years since we disbanded the Board and we're still buying our gas in gallons, our produce by the pounds and ounces, and measuring in feet and yards. Clearly, the voluntary approach to metrication did not work in this country and a stronger approach needs to be taken in future.
It will require a political will in the form of a grassroots effort to get the metric system implemented in this country. That will take some small amount of effort on the part of a large number of people—and that will take knowledge that there is a problem to begin with—something we've lost sight of during the last three decades.
I think the Board's chairman rightly summed up the situation in his own essay when he pointed out:
Centuries ago, it was inconvenient for the Western World to change from Roman numerals to the present Arabic figures. Thank heavens that early world persevered and progress prevailed.
It's time to let go of our “Roman numerals”—in the form of U.S. Customary units—and embrace the metric system for our own and successive generations, not to mention join with other nations of the world on some logical common ground.
That seems as basic to me as 1, 2, 3…not I, II, III.

Three months after she introduced the Internet Swatting Hoax Act in US Congress, Representative Katherine Clark (D-Mass.) found herself at the end of an apparent swatting attempt on Sunday night.
Melrose, Massachusetts police press spokesperson John Guilfoil confirmed to Ars Technica that the department received a phone call from "a computerized voice, not a natural voice" alleging "shots fired" and an "active shooter" at the address of Clark's home. The resulting police report confirmed an incident time of 9:57pm for a "life alert alarm" and "automated call reporting shooter."
This type of police report—using a disguised voice to allege false threats at a residence—is known as "swatting," due to the likelihood that police departments will react by sending SWAT teams to respond to serious-sounding threats. In the case of the Sunday night call, however, Guilfoil confirmed that Melrose police followed "established protocols" to choose a de-escalated response of normal police officers, though the officers in question blocked traffic on both ends of Clark's street with patrol cars. Guilfoil was unable to clarify whether weapons were drawn at the scene, and he did not answer our other questions about the incident, particularly those about the nature of the phone call received, "due to the ongoing nature of the investigation."
Though Representative Clark was unreachable for comment in time for this article's publication, she posted a link on her social media channels to a Boston Globe report about the incident, along with a statement: "I'm thankful no one was hurt and grateful for the timeliness and professionalism of the Melrose Police Dept." The Globe report confirms that Clark and her husband Rodney were home watching the HBO series Veep when police arrived at her home on Sunday night.
Clark told the Globe that the incident "will really cause me to double down" on efforts to combat swatting and other forms of online abuse—continuing her vocal streak against such practices. In November, she became the first US Representative to become lead sponsor of a bill that specifically targeted false police reports made over the Internet; the bill was referred to a Congressional subcommittee in December. Clark will continue speaking out against the practice at this March's South By Southwest, where she will take part in an all-day Online Harassment Summit.
A manhunt continued on Sunday for the "armed and dangerous" gunman who allegedly shot and killed New Kesington police officer Brian Shaw, authorities said.
Rahmael Sal Holt, 29, was identified by Pennsylvania State police as the gunman in Friday night's shooting, which occurred about 18 miles outside of Pittsburgh. Authorities filed charges of first-degree murder and murder of a police officer against Holt on Saturday.
Police describe Holt as being armed and dangerous and urged anyone with information to call 911.
Authorities said Shaw, 25, was shot in the chest Friday night during a foot pursuit that stemmed from the traffic stop in New Kensington. Investigators are still determining on Saturday why Shaw had initiated the traffic stop that ultimately led to his death by gunfire, but they declined to provide those details, citing the ongoing investigation.
The Pittsburgh area also continued an outpouring of support for regional first responders and for Officer Shaw's family.
Tributes included a moment of silence at Saturday night's NHL hockey game between the Pittsburgh Penguins and Chicago Blackhawks, and a tweet from NFL head coach Mike Tomlin of the Pittsburgh Steelers.
Later Friday, police located a brown, older model Jeep Grand Cherokee that was sought in connection with the shooting.
Meanwhile, funeral arrangements were announced for the fallen officer.
Visitation will take place Monday and Tuesday at Rusiewicz Funeral Home in Lower Burrell, Pa., with a funeral Mass set for 10 a.m. Wednesday at Mount St. Peter Church in New Kensington.
In other tweets since the shooting, the state police thanked community members for donations of food and water that had been made to emergency personnel.
Police also disclosed that reward money pledged for information leading to an arrest has now reached more than $40,000.

Devin Hester will write a monthly column for Chicago Parent about his travels around town with his son. This is the first column and appeared in the April 2011 print edition.
Where should we go? If you have any suggestions where the two Devins should go, let him know at his official Facebook page
I love playing football. I love it with a passion.
I love Chicago, and I wouldn't want to play for any other team than the Bears. But there's one thing I love more than football or the Bears-and I hate to disappoint any fans out there-but that's my little man, my son, Devin.
Devin is a little over a year old, and he's so much fun to be around. I love hanging with that little guy, which is why I wanted to start writing a column about Devin and what we like to do together.
There is so much to do in Chicago with your kids, and I'm looking forward to talking about all the places lil Devin and I go and the things we do each month.
Now that the season is over, I get to spend a lot more time with him, and I'm looking forward to us bouncing around Chicago. He was just an infant last off-season, and now that he's grown up a bit, there is a lot more we can do.
There are a ton of museums and history centers in Chicago, but I don't think my little guy would be up for that just yet.
So, one of our first stops this spring is going to be the Chicago Children's Museum. The thing I like about the Children's Museum is that it's so hands-on. I took Dev there last year, and even then there were things that seemed to get his attention. I'm looking forward to getting him back there again so he can get down and dirty with some of the toys and displays.
There's an area called "Play it Safe" that focuses on the younger children. It's like a realistic firehouse that lets families explore fire safety through play. Something tells me little Dev is just going to be climbing on the fire truck, but that's cool, too. He's getting to where he's tough to run down, so he'll keep me on my toes.
While at Navy Pier, there's a great place for a family dinner. Capi's Italian Kitchen offers Make Your Own Pizza parties, and then you get all-day admission to the museum after that. It's a pretty cool way to spend the day, and it's a pretty decent price, too.
Mostly, I just like hanging with my little man, and I can't begin to tell you how nice it is to come home to him after practice or after a game. Win or lose, he's always so happy to see me walk through the door.
It's going to be a fun off-season with Dev for sure.
Devin Hester is a wide receiver for the Chicago Bears. Last season, he set the NFL record for return touchdowns.
If you've visited Walt Disney World Magic Kingdom over the past couple of years, you may have noticed something a little … unusual … and I'm not talking about the ghost of deceased welder “George” on the Pirates of the Caribbean experience. Whereas you might have watched your dad sip on a cold, familiar Bud when you trekked to Orlando a kid, now you can stroll into bars like Leaping Horse Libations or the ESPN Wide World of Sports Complex and order beers with names like Funky Buddha Floridian Hefeweizen, Cigar City Florida Cracker Belgian-style White Ale and 3 Daughters Beach Blonde Ale.
These beers all originate within about three hours' drive time from the Magic Kingdom and pretty much sell as fast as breweries can make them. Their inclusion at the world's most popular theme park (as well as the hotels, restaurants and attractions that service it) marks a major shift in Florida's beer landscape and indicates an embrace of Florida craft beer that seemed practically foreign at a place like Epcot just a few short years ago.
“Florida was always known as a beer wasteland,” says KC Sentz, co-owner of the fantastically popular Oakland Park craft brewery Funky Buddha.
But now, “Everybody's opening their eyes to what this new world of craft beer can be,” says KC's brother, Ryan Sentz, who owns the operation with him.
In less than five years, the local and national reputation of the Florida beer scene has gone from non-existent to cult-like. At least two Florida beers (Cigar City Hunahpu's Imperial Stout and Funky Buddha Maple Bacon Coffee Porter) are among the most sought-after in the country, and when you travel around Florida's 183 licensed breweries, you're likely to hear the same refrain: Florida is America's fastest-growing state for craft breweries. Though the Florida Brewers Guild can only confirm that with no more than 25 breweries in 2007 and slightly more than 50 in 2013, it's “one of the fastest,” the distinction is somewhat insignificant when you consider the bigger picture: something is happening in Florida and it's not only unprecedented locally but unique.
“A lot of national brewers are skipping states to get into Florida,” says Cigar City COO Justin Clark. “They see this is a state worthy of putting resources into.”
Identity Politics
I first learned about Tampa's brewing powerhouse Cigar City shortly after it opened in 2008 when my brother, who lived in the city, introduced me to its rich, barrel-aged dark ales. I swooned and named myself the brewery's biggest out-of-state fan.
Living near Philadelphia, I was lucky to have the opportunity to follow brewmaster Wayne Wambles around to events he'd plan for Philly Beer Week, where once a year he'd sell limited-release beers in Pennsylvania for the special occasion. A few years after making his Philly debut, Wambles and Clark brought some Florida friends up to co-host beer week events. Ryan and KC Sentz impressed us Philadelphians immediately. A year or two after that, the buddies turned their events into showcases for Florida beer by including the then little-known breweries Brew Bus Brewing and Saltwater Brewery. I've always admired their show of brotherhood amongst competitors.
Alongside of an Anheuser-Busch InBev plant in Jacksonville and a Yuengling factory in Tampa, both of which open for public tours, it's this solidarity and strong local identity (plus an avalanche of awards) that's helped launch Florida beer onto the national scene, which, in turn, makes it more available at home.
“Who put beer on the map in Florida? Cigar City,” says Ryan Sentz. “I attribute a lot of our success to Cigar City. They lent us resources and shared knowledge so I'm happy to do that for others.”
Florida's topography, climate, coastal history, geographic isolation and demographic mix create a culture unlike any other. Although it goes without saying that Florida is home to many, many non-indigenous residents, many of its citizens share a collective identity that they guard fiercely. This gives brewers a strong foundation around which to forge their brand.
For example, Cigar City takes its name from Tampa's historical position as the US's hub for Cuban cigar distribution. And one of its core brands Florida Cracker plays off the nickname given to the state's Colonial-era cattle ranchers while the crisp, spicy beer provides a refreshing answer to the year-round heat.
That heat, coupled with tropical agriculture, adds to brewers' ability to plant their flag firmly in the Florida soil at a time when around the country, brewers are scrambling to grow an appetite for local terroir.
You may not be able to dial up a thick, creamy imperial stout on tap as often as you'd like but order a Citrus Kolsch at Miami's Concrete Beach Brewery and you're likely to taste the most perfect balance of beer and oranges that you could ever want. Mango, guava, key limes, passion fruit and coconut appear readily on brewery tap lists, and a Google search for “Florida kumquat beer” turns up four results.
Joshua Aubuchon, lobbyist and chief counsel for the brewers guild, speaks of lighter-bodied porters and stouts (Due South Brewing's Mexican Standoff is his favorite) and notes that some within the local population brew fruit into their effervescent Berliner weiss wheat beers and have coopted the name to reflect the style's provenance.
“They're no longer thinking of it as a Berliner weiss they're thinking of it as a Florida weiss,” he says.
Alan Newman, who launched Concrete Beach for the Alchemy & Science subsidiary of Boston Beer Co., has kept the original nomenclature on his several takes on the style. But he was happy to add to the conversation that surrounds Florida beer.
“Miami was a severely underserved craft market with hardly any (if any) local craft breweries. So it seemed like a likely place to but a local craft brewery – serving the local population and educating them on the virtues of fresh, local craft beer,” he says.
Come For the Sunshine
Newman, best known for founding Vermont's Magic Hat Brewing, happened to be around when I visited last year, and I was pleased to introduce my chauffeur uncle to such a luminary on his first visit to a brewery. That afternoon, my uncle and I also stopped in to Wynwood Brewing on the same street, which, with the addition of J. Wakefield Brewing on the other side of Concrete Beach, has helped turn the formerly blighted Wynwood neighborhood into a veritable beer destination.
Which brings me to my next point: tourism. 113 million tourists visited Florida last year, and that industry is finding some nice symbiosis with craft brewing. The examples are endless, and I'll start with one of my own.
I visit my grandmother outside Fort Lauderdale for a few days every year. Now that I've fallen in love with the Sunshine State's breweries, I stay a few days longer to visit newcomers and old favorites, and I try each time to rent a car and a hotel room to check out what's new four hours away in Tampa Bay (next time will definitely be Bob Sylvester's brand-new Brasserie Saint Somewhere in downtown Tarpon Springs). My visits reinforce my excitement and I travel home with cans, bottles and branded t-shirts to share the gospel with my friends.
Cigar City's annual Hunahpu's release brings rabid crowds from around the world, and its contracted brewpub in the Tampa airport greets 10,000 passengers who fly into the C terminal per day. That site will be expanding soon, and the brewery team is working on a second airport location in the international terminal. Plus, more than two dozen Florida cities host Major League Baseball spring training, which brings fans down from their respective cities looking for local beers and demanding to know why they can't buy them at home.
The answer to the last question lies in the age-old reality of supply and demand. Florida breweries literally sell beer faster than they can make it and there just isn't enough to go around. It's jaw-dropping to hear Cigar City's Clark tick off the near-yearly jumps the brewery has made to annual production (in number of barrels) since opening less than a decade ago.
“3500; 10,000; 17,000; then 26,000; 34,000; and now we're over 60,000 barrels,” he said during my last visit a year ago. That number still holds at 64,000 barrels.
“Our first year we did under 1000 barrels and currently that's what we're packaging in any given week,” he says.
You can find a rare bottle or two of Cigar City or Saint Somewhere in Philly or New York, and Tampa's Coppertail Brewing has its own sales rep in Philadelphia, thanks to brewmaster Casey Hughes' long stint as a brewer here, but generally you have to travel to the source. It's expensive to ship beer up the eastern seaboard and it's not always worth the paperwork to distribute in closer states like Georgia or Alabama because they're not exactly considered top beer markets. And there's that whole loyalty thing again.
“Florida, Florida, Florida, Florida,” asserts KC Sentz.
“Our first goal is to get as much beer as possible into Florida, as it's an underserved area,” explains his brother.
So far, one answer to Cigar City's capacity problem has been Brew Hub, a first-of-its kind contract brewing facility east of Tampa in Lakeland. Until each of the breweries under the same ownership as Cigar City purchases its anticipated centrifuge to make Jai Alai, Brew Hub brews mass amounts of the flagship IPA and has undergone three expansions in its own brief life. Though founder Tim Schoen is building a similar facility near where he lives in Missouri, he chose to open in Florida first, primarily because of its growth potential and location.
“When decision was made (2012), Florida had 5% Craft share with a 25% trend increase,” he bullet-points in an email. “2016 Florida Craft segment has increased to 15% and still maintains a double digit growth rate. Our site is within 100 miles of 8.5 million consumers.”
Not everything is perfect in Fla-Fla Land, of course. Four craft breweries have closed since 2014, and like anywhere else, I've found myself very underwhelmed with quality at at least four different places. But as craft brewers fight together to loosen state liquor laws, they're opening up pathways to make more money, which will hopefully encourage them to hire more experienced brewers (or send them for training) and buy higher-quality ingredients and equipment.
A 2015 law that allowed beertenders to fill 64-ounce to-go growlers proved pivotal, and in 2014 lawmakers knocked down an attempt to require breweries to sell their packaged beer to a distributor then buy it back to sell it at their own tasting room. A current bill would permit breweries that produce less than 3500 barrels a year to “self-distribute” to bars, restaurants and liquor stores without using a middle man.
Excuse the puns but there hasn't typically been much tailwind for liquor liberalization in Tallahassee over the years. Finally, Florida's beer ship does seem to be sailing pretty smoothly.
“I'd say we're ten to 15 years behind California or Oregon or Colorado,” says Aubuchon. “But we're catching up. Slowly but surely.”

The inability for Congress to repeal Obamacare or replace it with an alternative brings to light another way for the Trump Administration to right the wrongs that Obamacare unleashed on the American middle class.
Families across America are threatened by an undercapitalized Fannie and Freddie because the funds were instead used to fund Obamacare. The Obama Administration took $260 Billion that would have normally helped lower and middle-class families in rural America and inner cities buy homes and instead diverted the money to pay for the failed health care plan.
This was a complete circumvention of Congress' authority and was very likely an illegal action by the Obama Administration.
It can be fixed by Treasury instructing the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FIFA) Director Mel Watt that the Net Worth Sweep is over. Mr. Watt is on record with his concern over the undercapitalization that has been caused by the sweep and presumably he would prefer not to make this payment and would follow this directive.
The Trump Administration has an opportunity on March 31st to right this wrong. It is time to pull the financial plug out of Obamacare and protect middle-class taxpayers.
They could also demand the Justice Department launch an investigation into how the money was spent.
Drew Johnson wrote on this for the Daily Caller:
“If President Donald Trump is truly committed to draining the swamp, he should look no further than putting an end to the Net Worth Sweep. There is simply no place in the federal government for a scam that improperly funded Obamacare behind the backs of Members of Congress, while ripping off the investors who bailed out America's housing market.
Rather than allowing the Net Worth Sweep to continue, President Trump should stop the sweep payments, demand the Justice Department turn over 11,000 Net Worth Sweep-related documents the previous administration refused to make public, and fully investigate how every dime of Net Worth Sweep money has been spent.”

I'm going to attempt the impossible: to tell an engaging story accessible to relative laymen using a hex editor (a program for manually editing binary files). The above is the binary content of a very simple test GIF I made in order to better understand the GIF specification. Here it is, if you want to play along at home: I'll walk you through each part of the file, and explain each part as it pertains to the history of the GIF.
GIF89a
The Graphics Interchange Format (GIF) was invented by CompuServe in 1987. The eighties were really the wild west days of the internet. The web had yet to be invented, and the internet had yet to go mainstream. At the start of the decade, there was no such thing as a single internet. Instead, there were a bunch of different computer networks that gradually grew together to form one. CompuServe ran one of these networks.
CompuServe was founded in 1969. These were the days when computers were so large and expensive that regular companies couldn't afford one, so they rented computing time from a timesharing company. Compuserve was one such company, and they built a dial-up network to support their business. In 1979, they became the first to provide an online service to regular consumers. This was not the internet: it was a self-contained network, unconnected to the various other computer networks at the time. Downloading files from this network—which would be connected to the general internet in the late 80s—was the purpose GIF was designed for. The first GIF standard was released in 1987, and the second in July, 1989. The GIF file format has remained unchanged since then. The web hadn't been invented yet.
GIF files weren't intended to store animations. Unlike other image formats, however, GIF files were designed to hold more than one image. This had more to do with eliminating redundant information that was shared across files than with sequences of moving images. Online connections weren't fast in 1987. Here's what the 1989 standard has to say:
A GIF Data Stream is a sequence of protocol blocks and sub-blocks representing a collection of graphics. In general, the graphics in a Data Stream are assumed to be related to some degree, and to share some control information; it is recommended that encoders attempt to group together related graphics in order to minimize hardware changes during processing and to minimize control information overhead.
The updated standard published in 1989 introduced two crucial features on the way to the animated GIF we all know and love. One was delays between one image and the next. There was no explicit mention of animation in the standard:
Delay Time – If not 0, this field specifies the number of hundredths (1/100) of a second to wait before continuing with the processing of the Data Stream.
The other new feature was Application Extension Blocks, which allow for information to be encoded into GIF files that tells a specific application to process the file in a specific way. (Other applications will ignore this info.) Note that the standard actually discourages developers from using Application Extension Blocks, and instead recommends that they embed the GIF format in their own file formats:
As an embedded protocol, GIF may be part of larger application protocols, within which GIF is used to render graphics. (…) This approach is recommended in favor of using Application Extensions, which become overhead for all other applications that do not process them.
04 00 04 00
This part defines the size of what the GIF standard calls the “Logical Screen”. This is the overall size of the image (here 4×4 pixels, each dimension stored as a 16-bit integer). Note, however, that each image in the file need not have the same dimensions as the “logical screen”. As long as the image fits within the logical screen, it can be smaller, and indeed, each image within a GIF file must specify an offset of the logical screen. (If you have a GIF where the content is surrounded on all sides by one solid color, you can use this feature to optimize the file.)
FF FF FF 00 00 00
After some flags, we come to another well-known feature of GIFs: the color table. As you probably know, GIFs can only store 256 different colors. This makes it ill-suited for true-color photographs. These 256 colors, however, can be chosen from a palette of millions. It's just that out of those millions of colors, each image in the GIF can only use 256. The color table stores the color values for each of these 256 colors, and then the rest of the file simply specifies where in the table each pixel's color is located. This GIF file has the simplest possible palette: only two colors, pure white (FF FF FF) and pure black (00 00 00). GIF was an improvement over CompuServe's older file format, which only supported black and white.
!NETSCAPE2.0
This is where things start to get interesting. In 1991, Tim Berners-Lee opened the web to the public. Although there were others, the first great web browser was called Mosaic. Mosaic evolved into the second great browser, and the one that went head-to-head with Internet Explorer during the Browser Wars of the nineties: Netscape Navigator. (The Netscape codebase later evolved into Mozilla Firefox. Netscape lost the war with Internet Explorer, but IE lost the war to Firefox. The Mosaic line won in the end. But I digress.)
In the early days, there was no way to embed an image into an HTML page. While working on Mosaic, Marc Andreessen came up with the <img> tag. You can read more about this here. When Andreessen announced the <img> tag in February, 1993, his was far from the only proposed way to embed images into web pages. Many people disagreed with his proposal. Some proposed alternative tags. Others wanted a general solution to embedding other media into web pages. Why create a dedicated image tag, when this would surely lead to dedicated video tags, audio tags, and so on? Why not create a general solution that could embed all sorts of media, including images, video, audio, and novel future media?
This was another important moment that led to the ubiquity of animated GIFs. Andreessen and the other pioneers could have devised a way to embed general media into web pages in 1993. If they had, then we wouldn't have had to wait so long for non-GIF video formats to work everywhere. But Andreessen's proposal won out, and so the GIF, the video file format that masquerades as still image, became the only way to display moving images on the web everywhere you can display stills. Why did Andreessen win? Because he happened to be the developer of a popular web browser, and he shipped code that worked. Once <img> worked in Mosaic, it soon spread and became ubiquitous. The img tag started showing up in HTML standards after the web browsers had standardized on it.
Then, finally, we get to Netscape 2.0. Peek inside a GIF file sometime: every animated GIF contains a reference to Netscape Navigator 2.0, a browser that has been obsolete for fifteen years. Netscape 2 introduced a slew of new features: embedded Java, JavaScript, frames. And animated GIFs. Netscape 2.0, you see, defined one of those Application Extension Blocks. What the Extension Block does is basically said that the browser should loop through each image within the GIF file. Although other people had come up with the idea of using the multi-image feature of GIF to make animations, interest in animated GIFs didn't explode until Netscape made the feature available to website owners everywhere.
Remember this little fellow, one of the first animated GIFs to truly go viral?
21 F9 04 04 64 00 00 00 2C
Finally, we're closing in on the actual image in my sample GIF. The sequence that starts with an exclamation point (0x21 in hex) is a control block that has metadata for the image data to come.
The highlighted section in the screenshot says that the browser should wait one-hundred 1/00ths of a second (i.e., one whole second) after rendering the first frame before rendering the next. After the comma comes the first image frame.
02 04 8C 8F 19 05 00
The tiny bits here are the actual pixel data. Everything else is metadata. Of course, I deliberately made this file very small in order for it to be instructive. In a real file, which would be much larger than 4×4 pixels, data will outweigh metadata. The pixel data, as mentioned, consists of a series of bytes, each of which represents one pixel by telling a decoder where in the color table to look for the right color value. Only, it's not so simple. As you can see, there are only seven bytes to describe sixteen pixels, and each pixel is supposed to be described by one byte. This is because the lossless Lempel-Ziv-Welch compression algorithm is used to reduce file sizes.
When CompuServe developed GIF in 1987, LZW compression was a commonly used technique, and CompuServe found it natural to use it for GIF. Unbeknownst to CompuServe, however, a patent on the LZW technique had been already been granted to Unisys. For years, Unisys chose to ignore people using it in software, rather staking their claim against manufacturers implementing the algorithm in hardware. In late 1994, Unisys suddenly decided to start pursuing software implementations, and CompuServe in particular. Predictably, there was outrage. The whole debacle ended with a deal where people who wrote software that processed GIF files would have to pay royalties to UniSys, while end users were free to use GIF as they pleased. In order to develop a completely free and open alternative to GIF, a working group sat down and eventually came up with PNG.
The LZW patents expired in 2004, and since then, GIF has been completely free.
3B, or ;
The semicolon indicates the end of a GIF file, and the end of this discussion. I said that I find this story interesting and instructive, and I stand by that. I fully understand that some may consider this too long and too technical, but the technical aspects tie in to many of the most important events and trends in internet history.
Here's an interesting graph. I don't know of any way to reliably quantify the public interest in GIFs, but we can make an estimate using Google trend data. Although it feels like GIFs (especially the animated variety) are everywhere, people certainly are googling less for them than they were before. I suspect that while meme gifs are common on blogs and forums, the many other uses for the file format are slowly being phased out. The GIF is really only suitable for small pictures with a very limited color palette. Due to historical accident, it has seen more widely use than its technical qualities would indicate. Now, finally, twenty-plus years after the GIF was invented, we're seeing widespread support and adoption of alternatives. PNGs, JPEGs and HTML5's <video> are making the old uses for the GIF obsolete. What we are left with is the GIF as the lowest common denominator. Not unlike the memes it's being paired with.
If you're technically inclined, and if the above mass of words wasn't enough for you, you might want to read the GIF specification. Be prepared to muck around alt-tabbing between binary files and your browser window for a while before it starts making sense. The specification also details other, little-used (and little-supported) features of the file format, such as waiting for user input before proceeding with an animation, and rendering plain text stored in the file (not in the rasterized image data).
A new type of antibiotic can effectively treat an antibiotic-resistant infection by disarming instead of killing the bacteria that cause it. Researchers report their findings in the October 2 issue of mBio®, the online open-access journal of the American Society for Microbiology.
"Traditionally, people have tried to find antibiotics that rapidly kill bacteria. But we found a new class of antibiotics which has no ability to kill Acinetobacter that can still protect, not by killing the bug, but by completely preventing it from turning on host inflammation," says Brad Spellberg of the UCLA Medical Center and David Geffen School of Medicine, a researcher on the study.
New drugs are badly needed for treating infections with the bacterium Acinetobacter baumannii, a pathogen that most often strikes hospital patients and immune- compromised individuals through open wounds, breathing tubes, or catheters. The bacterium can cause potentially lethal bloodstream infections. Strains of A. baumannii have acquired resistance to a wide range of antibiotics, and some are resistant to every FDA-approved antibiotic, making them untreatable.
Spelling and his colleagues found that in laboratory mice it was possible to mitigate the potentially lethal effects of the bacterium by blocking one of its toxic products rather than killing it.
"We found that strains that caused the rapidly lethal infections shed lipopolysaccharide [also called LPS or endotoxin] while growing. The more endotoxin shed, the more virulent the strain was," says Spellberg. This pinpointed a new therapy target for the researchers: the endotoxin these bacteria shed in the body.
Blocking the synthesis ofthe endotoxin with a small molecule called LpxC-1 prevented infected mice from getting sick. Unlike traditional antibiotics, Spellberg says, LpxC-1 doesn't kill the bacteria, it just shuts down the manufacture of the endotoxin and stops the body from mounting the inflammatory immune response to it that is the actual cause of death in seriously ill patients.
Spellberg says this is a direction few researchers have taken when exploring ways to treat infections but that it could make the difference in finding an effective drug. The results also highlight how important it is to find new, physiologically relevant ways of screening potential antibiotics for pathogens with a high degree of resistance, write the authors. Molecules like LpxC-1 that inhibit rather than kill bacteria wouldn't pass muster with traditional antibiotic screens that are based on killing effectiveness.
Liise-anne Pirofski of the Albert Einstein College of Medicine and a reviewer of the study for mBio® says neutralizing virulence factors is showing a lot of promise as an alternative route for treating infections. "There's a growing movement in infectious disease therapy to control the host inflammation response in treatment rather than just 'murdering' the organism," says Pirofski. "This is a very elegant and important validation that this approach can work - at least in mice."

(CNN) When asked Thursday why he is longer speaks out against Donald Trump's call to ban Muslims from entering the United States, Mike Pence had a simple explanation.
"Well, because it's not Donald Trump's position now," Pence said during an appearance on CNN's "New Day."
Trump's so-called "Muslim ban" has been tweaked several times in the 10 months since he proposed it, making the actual substance of the policy muddled and confusing.
Pence, meanwhile, has faced questions after he repeatedly passed up opportunities to defend his running mate at the top of the Republican ticket at Tuesday's vice presidential debate.
The Indiana governor expressed differences with Trump before he joined the party's ticket, including on the Muslim ban. When Trump called for a "total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States" in December, Pence called the proposal "offensive and unconstitutional."

Nickelodeon
Rocko, Spunky, Heffer, Filburt, and the Bigheads are returning to O-Town for a TV movie, Nickelodeon confirmed to Entertainment Weekly on Thursday. [Note: Nickelodeon and MTV News are both owned by Viacom.] O-Town, in case you forgot, doubles as Rocko's fictional hometown and is one of many dirty jokes in the animated children's show. Perhaps you've seen this image floating around the internet?
Nickelodeon
Yep, that's Rocko. Rocko's Modern Life made sex references all the time — you were just too young to notice. Childhood = ruined.
But now fans are all grown up and ready to revisit their favorite characters. The show wrapped 10 years ago after four seasons, so it's about time for a reboot. Creator Joe Murray will executive produce and codirect the one-hour TV special.
“I'm very happy to be rejoining Rocko and my friends from O-Town again,” Murray said in a statement. “What I have found by bringing these characters back is that it's not so much about nostalgia, but a sense that they still feel relevant and fresh to me, and after 20 years, they can't wait to comment on modern life in the 21st century. They still have a lot to say.”
There's no word on a release date, but in the meantime, relive the craziness by watching the show's brilliant opening credits on loop.
Hello all. I took a journey from Central Florida to the shores of Lake Erie this past weekend to say goodbye to an old friend. That old friend was Mean Streak roller coaster, a roller coaster that was built in 1991 as the tallest and fastest wooden roller coaster in the world. The coaster delighted over 26 million guests during its run and used to be a fantastic coaster! I started my working days as a teenager at this wonderful park and used to take many rides on this roller coaster day in and day out. I started out in Soak City and Challenge Park as admissions and eventually worked my way around all Challenge Park. I quickly discovered that 2 things that I spent a lot of time at in the park in the 90's were disappearing. Not only was Mean Streak leaving but Challenge Park had already left, or was at least in the process of being bulldozed. This is all taking place to expand oak City into Cedar Point Shores. So let's start by taking a look at the destruction of the entire Challenge Park area.
Here the old ticket booths that would sell Go-Kart, Challenge Golf, and Soak City tickets is down to its frame.
Challenge Golf is also being torn up to make room for more parking. This was a 36 hole golf course that had some fun holes and challenges.
Gone are the caves and waterfalls of this once spectacular putt-putt course
Also a casualty of the expansion is RipCord Skycoaster. Slated to move somewhere inside the park for the 2017 season I found it laying down on the job for the remainder of the season.
As you can see it looks a little different without the large metal arch sitting next to Magnum
The old RipCord ticketing and prep area looks to be next to see the bulldozer.
The mighty towers of RipCord now sit on their side awaiting word on their new home.
The bolts that once held up RipCord are seen here.
Last we see the top pieces of the steel arch sitting next to Magnum's 1st hill.
This large grassy area was once home to Go-Karts zooming around Magnum. This area will soon be home to a new slide complex as part of the new Cedar Point Shores.
Even current Soak City structures are coming down to make way for its rebuild and re-branding. The large pile of rubble was once the Soak City gift shop.
I spent 3 seasons working all of these rides and attractions before moving elsewhere in the park. It is sad for me to see it all go, but I understand that this is a industry of change and I truly look forward to visiting Cedar Point Shores next summer.
Next up on this stop was taking one last ride on the wooden giant Mean Streak. This Coaster actually holds a lot of great memories for me as I would honestly ride this every night multiple times before the park closed. If I was at Cedar Point that day, whether I was working or playing, it was a guarantee that you could have found me riding Mean Streak. In the fall of 1997 I took my 1,000th ride on the coaster. The crew threw me a party and we had a great time. Yes I was one of those that kept count of my rides.
Before taking my rides I took a spin around perimeter road. This structure is absolutely beautiful and if you never drove around to the back of the park you were missing out on a sight.
Looking at the lift hill makes you realize this ride is nothing short of impressive. The entire structure is made up of 1.7 million board feet of southern yellow pine.
Looking at the First turn, this was such a thrilling part of the ride when it opened in 1991.
While waiting in line you had the opportunity to stand inside the very dense structure.
As people took their final rides they gathered in the midway awaiting the funeral for the coaster.
Just a little after 7:30 as Mean Streak was giving its final rides the funeral for the coaster had begun. Check out video taken of the funeral here:
A funeral is not without flowers. Many of Cedar Point's departments (and one special coaster) sent flowers.
As they very final trains ran the carpenters arrived to make it official and take the entrance sign to the coaster down.
Video here:
Here you can see them taking the sign down
The sign found its way to the front of the park in the Dead Rides Cemetery.
The tombstone reads:
“The Mean Streak's demise is no laughing matter,
Just ask the tearful chiropractor,
No more, will it shake and rattle your bones,
And FrontierTown will be absent of groans.”
So with much celebration and fanfare the coaster permanently closed its entrance gates. People are awaiting with baited breath the announcement of what is going to replace Mean Streak. I for one am thankful for the many great rides this coaster gave in the early 90's and look forward to what happens with this space and coaster structure. Yes, I said structure….

I recently wrote about what procrastination isn't and a bit about what it is, or what it might be. You can find that post here. I believe one of the biggest misnomers about procrastination is that it is synonymous with being “lazy”. Not only do I think that procrastination has nothing to do with being “lazy” but that the “lazy” label also hurts our efforts to deal with it. So the first step to dealing with procrastination is to drop the “lazy” label because it promotes shame. Nothing will get a person to avoid something quicker than feeling shame in their behavior.
So, there's the first step. Drop the shame. And if you're someone who is trying to get someone else to stop procrastinating, stop shaming them. The next step would be to own your procrastination as to enable you deal with it.
Here are 5 ways to deal with procrastination:
1. Get started. Just start.
You might make an agreement with yourself. It would state that if the activity is as indeed miserable as you imagined it would be, you can stop. Commit to a few minutes of doing the task. If it's horrible, walk away. Minimize the over inflation of the difficulty of the task by simply focusing on starting the task. Just start. Do nothing more.
2. Once you've started, notice how it feels to start and get active in doing the task.
No, really. Pay attention to your mood and energy level. Has it shifted? Do you feel better? Do you have more energy? Begin to notice and associate good feelings and sensations with doing and accomplishing tasks.
3. Write things down.
Get the clutter out of your head first by organizing your thoughts on paper. You'll be surprised how much easier things seem once you stop thinking about how much you hate doing them in your head.
4. Prioritize your task list and do the most enjoyable, or least painful things, first.
Get into a good rhythm by doing something that's not so bad. For example, if you like mowing the lawn more than the grocery store, do that first. Do you like washing the car more than cleaning the gutters? Do that first. Focus on the doing and not the feelings and thoughts of being overwhelmed.
5. Pay for someone else to do it.
Can you afford to hire someone to mow the lawn or clean the gutters? Ask yourself how much your time and mental energy is worth to you. If you can spare a few bucks don't be embarrassed to hire the neighborhood kid to take care of the lawn or rake the leaves. This will leave more time for you to do the things that you like doing. Or it might make more time for you to do the things that are higher on your list of priorities. Those things which you CAN'T pay someone to do.
This list is by no means exhaustive, nor is it meant to be a cure all. What are some ways that you find helpful in dealing with procrastination?

A REPUBLICAN group on ceasefire has been linked to a bomb cache uncovered in west Belfast.
Police investigating the INLA found five pipe bombs and ammunition in a house on Conway Street, close to the Falls Road, yesterday.
Several homes were evacuated after a suspicious object was found yesterday morning.
The find comes amid reports that a disagreement among INLA members led to the shooting of two teenagers, including a 16-year-old boy, in west Belfast last week.
However, a police spokesman said last night the pipe bomb find was not being linked to the shootings.
Detective Chief Inspector Pete Mullan said yesterday's operation was "part of an ongoing investigation into organised criminality associated to (the) INLA by detectives from PSNI's Reactive and Organised Crime Branch".
He said the bombs and ammunition were "for one purpose only - to kill and injure people".
"Information from the community is vital and I would continue to ask for the public to report any suspicious activity to police on 101 or if you wish to remain anonymous, through Crimestoppers on 0800 555111," he said.
The INLA had a strong presence in the Falls Road area during the Troubles. The group, frequently divided by internal feuds, was thought to have been behind more than 120 murders during the Troubles. It declared a ceasefire in August 1998 but was later linked to several murders and attacks. The group did not decommission until 2010.
In 2015, masked INLA members paraded through Derry following the death of Peggy O'Hara, mother of INLA hunger striker Patsy O'Hara. Shots were also fired over Mrs O'Hara's coffin.
The SDLP's Alex Attwood said the INLA "represent a serious threat to the welfare of people and the community".
"All must face it down," he said.
He added: "Today's arms find is a welcome intervention against terror and criminality. It is the type of firm policing that is needed. We need it month in and month out, year in and year out."
Ulster Unionist Fred Rodgers welcomed the find.
"There is no place in our society for any group that seeks to impose its will on communities by the threat of, or use of force," he said.
Growing up in the west, especially in America, one is taught that you live in the most glorious time ever—the most wonderful, wealthy, stable, free, and best place on the planet. As one accepts the red pill, many of these assumptions are questioned. And while many of these truths may have proven true in the past, the excesses of modern liberal democracy have created weak men, shrill, out of shape, and damaged women, a decrepit culture, and declining values. America indeed has the *potential* to be great, but the western culture today destroys everything it touches. Here are a few examples:
1. Asians
Asians are naturally thin, petite, and healthy—IN ASIA. The country with the longest lifespan is Japan, which is one of the most isolated Asian nations, physically, culturally, and economically. The average Japanese person lives until age 80 for males and 87 for females (America is ranked #34). However, when Asians move to the west and adopt our culture, diet, and lifestyle, they become overweight, slutty, and often mutilate their bodies and experiment with gender fluidity.
2. Public Outings
The other day I met a girl at the park. The idea for this article hit me after seeing the number of people there, with a partner of the opposite sex, on a beautiful day, in a pleasant atmosphere, ignoring all of this for to play on their smartphones. The result is a lack of physical and emotional intimacy, save for the actual moment of banging your partner.
3. Dancing
Dancing used to be a social skill, a fun activity to do in free time, a great way to meet women, and a way to perpetuate a history or culture, with many ethic groups like Italians, Irish, Russians, Jews, and others learning traditional dance moves in traditional clothing. Today, all sense of history or culture is lost, and modern dance has become at best the uncoordinated Elaine Benice “poke your hands” move, and at worst free form sexual gyrating and twerking.
4. Career
For centuries, civilizations around the world developed and fostered a pride and honor in working. Regimented trade orders would train protégés in a skill, which they would finely hone for years, under the supervision of mentors, until they developed the necessary skill set to be proficient at a skill that they turned into a lifetime career. Tailors mended old clothing and created custom fits that accentuated the style and body type of the wearer. Shoemakers patched and re-soled leather shoes that were made to last decades. Butchers were more than just meat slicers, but would cut special cuts of various thickness of unprocessed meat on demand, offer aged and premium cuts of various types, and ensured their product was fresh and tasty.

Men could raise a family of four on one salary alone, often affording a nice house, car, and family vacations. Fast forward to 2016 and the profit-at-all-costs fascist system of today believes that producing at the lowest cost is the only metric of importance. Can Mexicans assemble a car for a quarter the cost of Detroit workers? Then it must be a good idea. Can Indians answer telephones and read scripts in a poor attempt at recreating actual customer service? Then let's shut down the local call center and open up abroad. Most young people today don't anticipate having the same job for more than five years, which is good, because it probably won't last that long.
5. Men
American Millennial men are some of the most insufferable beings I come across, second only to millennial women. They are shallow, silly, weak, vapid, directionless, and boring. This isn't because they are somehow inferior people than prior generations. It's simply that living in the modern Western liberal democracy creates and fosters this type of person. In a sane, traditional society, men today could be just as happy, interesting, masculine, and satisfied as their fathers.
6. Women
This hardly needs mentioning here, so I'll let the pictures do the talking. We all know that the quality of women offered today in the West is abysmal. If you haven't been abroad within the last year, plan a trip now, if for no other reason than to see what is possible. We do not have to accept the low quality females we are being offered here.
Ignore, Withdraw, or Leave
This isn't to say that America is a bad place, or that it is intrinsically evil; if anything, it has the potential to become one of the greatest, wealthiest, happiest, successful civilizations on the planet. But the current system of liberal democracy destroys all potential for this success. It angers me every time I see a fat Asian, because I know how difficult it is for Asians to work against their biology to become fat. And it angers me when I see a thin, kind, young woman who has pierced and mutilated her body with graffiti and shrapnel, and has taken up the cause for feminism. Without a strong, patriarchal system to guide her, she becomes an enemy of civilization itself.
So what options do those of us still living in the west have? There are three:
1. Do your best to ignore it, stacking currency and saving for trips abroad where one can appreciate an ordered, traditional culture with morals, priorities, and feminine women.
2. Leave the city and find a way to live as a hermit, remaining in America but interacting as little as possible with others.
3. Find greener pastures abroad. Relocate to a more traditional, simple society.
But I must reiterate one point. If you have not traveled abroad within the last year, plan a trip now. Airfares are as low as $300 round trip to Central America, and under $800 to Asia. Prices have never been lower. Go, experience another culture, realize there is an alternative to your lifestyle, and make a plan to do one of the three above. Because if you don't, the above serves as powerful and damning evidence of how Western culture can destroy greatness. Are you strong enough to resist it?

MSNBC's Hardball host Chris Matthews was back and firing on all cylinders Monday night, overseeing a show devoid of reason as it linked conservatives, Republicans, and anyone in the “right-wing” to the KKK, neo-Nazis, and white supremacists associated with Saturday's Charlottesville terrorism.
Matthews also showed ineptitude in not knowing until very recently that progressive heartthrob and President Woodrow Wilson loved the KKK film Birth of a Nation so much that he had it shown at the White House.
He began his show with a personal summation of racism in America:
There's been an historic evil in this country. It's an evil that began with slavery, of course, an institution that subjugated millions of human beings with whips and shackles until it ended in the blood of a civil war. It's an evil that reemerged as the Ku Klux Klan, founded in the spirit of slavery, which terrorized the country in the decades after that war, nor was it limited to the South. A full half century after the Civil War's end, the 1915 film Birth of a Nation found a national audience, stirring and refueling a resurgence of the Klan for decades thereafter. Well, the events of this weekend in beautiful, historic Charlottesville, Virginia, show that the KKK may have been suppressed but not extinguished. We saw that the evil whose seeds were in slavery remains still in the American soil, still waiting for its moment to rise again.
After highlighting the violence in Charlottesville, Matthews suggested the violence “may have matched the horror” of what President Trump was unable to do on Saturday, which was condemned the KKK, neo-Nazis, and white supremacists by name.
“It's the same man who built his national following on his original sin of charging the country's first African-American President of being foreign born, therefore, in his telling, not constitutional. Well, rather than hold them responsible, Trump instead blamed ‘many sides,' drawing a moral equivalency between the white supremacists and the counter-protesters demonstrating against them,” Matthews added.
NAACP president Derrick Johnson continued to prove that nothing the President said could have satisfied him and even extended conservative principles like voter ID to be examples of pro-Nazi policies:
Well, words don't matter in this case. Actions speak. This President should have made these comments during his campaign season. He set a tone that allowed for individuals to feel as if it's OK to spout racial hatred, individuals who feel it's OK to hold up Nazism in a way in which they murdered a woman this week....If he wanted to take real action, he really should take a look at the policies he is establishing dealing with affirmative action, the policies he's establishing deal with voting, the fact that he has a white supremacist as his adviser. So his words mean little. His actions will speak loud.
The Washington Post's Eugene Robinson continued to link those who have denounced that Charlottesville hate to those people anyway because, as expected, leftists like Robinson aren't interested in uniting people across various ideologies.
It's difficult to do that when you're lumping millions of people in with neo-Nazis:
[T]he silence on Saturday was disgraceful, I thought. I mean, it's not what, you know, you want to hear from the President of the United States. You want to hear the President come out forcefully in defense of American values, in defense of the better angels of our nature, in defense of what we aspire to be and this nonsense about "many sides" was, you know, a sop to the right wing, alt-right, white supremacists who formed, you know, part of his support base. I mean, let's be honest. They supported him.
In the latest installment of Matthews showing cluelessness, Matthews revealed that he didn't know Wilson held a White House screening of a pro-KKK filming. Seconds earlier, Johnson spread fake news that Republicans haven't denounced Trump's tepid Charlottesville response:
JOHNSON: Well, this is the equivalent to Woodrow Wilson showing Birth of a Nation in the White House. He's pandering to a -- the lower denomination of this nation is not the values that we should hold. If this is what it means to make America great again, it's the 1950 versions of it, and (INAUDIBLE) not great during that time. We have to decide, are we going to be an America that's looking forward, that's inclusive? And I call on his colleagues, his Republican Party colleagues, to denounce his actions. This is something that has been taking place for a while. We started with dog whistle politics. Now we are open and notorious (ph) with supporting individuals who espouse white supremacist notions. It should not be accepted in this America. MATTHEWS: Yes, you're so right about Birth of a Nation. I just saw a documentary on it the other night, and it's about -- you know, this guy, Griffith, D.W. Griffith, puts out a movie that glorifies the Ku Klux Klan, makes them the heroes of our time. And it goes out across the country and people — white people all go see it and cheer it. This is 1915. I didn't realize that Wilson had had the thing played in the White House. But it was outrageous. And we're seeing — we don't know the total reaction -- everyone on this show knows. We don't know the total reaction of what happened in Charlottesville. We're hearing the outcry against it. But what's happening out in the country? We don't know yet if they're not picking up recruits.
Later, guest and former FBI agent Mike German also conflated Trump's failures and rhetoric with policies being put forth by not only the White House but Republicans as “discriminatory, that are having disparate impacts on Muslim communities, on Latino communities and communities of color across the country.”
Here's the relevant portions of the transcript from MSNBC's Hardball on August 14:
The likely breakup of Iraq into feuding ethnic and sectarian bastions accelerated Friday as Iraq's senior Shiite Muslim cleric broke years of support for the central government and decreed that every able-bodied Shiite man had a religious obligation to defend the sect's holy sites from rebellious Sunni Muslims led by fighters from the extremist Islamic State of Iraq and Syria.
In answer to the call, thousands of Shiites _ many with militia experience from the sectarian war that pitted Sunnis against Shiites and killed thousands from 2006 to 2008 _ flooded the cities of Baghdad, Najaf and Karbala to receive weapons, enlist in organized units and receive their orders.
Hours later, President Barack Obama made it clear that the United States was unwilling to commit itself to the defense of a government that had been unable to resolve Iraq's ethnic and sectarian differences.
“We're not going to allow ourselves to be dragged back into a situation in which, while we're there, we're keeping a lid on things, and after enormous sacrifices by us, as soon as we're not there, suddenly people end up acting in ways that are not conducive to the long-term stability and prosperity of the country,” Obama said.
With Sunni Islamists in control of much of the north and west, Kurds expanding their control of the long-contested Kirkuk region and Shiites gathering for sectarian war, the likelihood of any accommodation seemed remote.
Emma Sky, a fellow at Yale University who advised U.S. forces in Iraq until 2010, called the events “the slow death” of the Iraqi state in an interview with McClatchy.
Perhaps most telling was Grand Ayatollah Ali al Sistani's religious endorsement of Shiite men taking up arms to defend “their homes, their cities and their holy places” from the Sunnis. Previously, Sistani had rejected militia activities and urged support for the central government, even during the darkest days of the 2006-08 sectarian war.
A Shiite resident of Baghdad, who asked to be called Abu Zeinab, said his neighborhood near the Shiite Shrine of Khadam in the neighborhood of Khadamiya was filled with volunteers after Sistani's decree became known.
“The statement by the marja, Sistani,” he said, using an Arabic term of respect that loosely means “object of emulation,” “has changed everything now. It says we should fight as Shiites to protect Shiites. I think this means there is no Iraqi state now.”
Iraqi state television showed dozens of vehicles filled with hundreds of men in Baghdad singing martial Shiite songs commemorating the battle of Karbala in A.D. 680, when the Sunni caliphate destroyed a Shiite uprising _ an event that's played heavily in the rhetoric of both sides; in recent days, Islamic State of Iraq members have threatened to repeat that massacre.
“People are scared of the Wahhabi invaders,” Abu Zeinab said, using a term common in Iraq to describe ISIS ideology that allows killing Muslims deemed insufficiently pious, particularly Shiites. “All the boys from the neighborhood who were in militias during the American occupation have returned, and hundreds of youth from the (Shiite-dominated south) have come to fight. The government and the militias are handing out arms. I think there're Iranians here as well; there're always Iranians here at the shrine.”
Other Baghdad residents reached by phone said a near-panic had set in among much of the population as rumors were spreading about an impending jihadist invasion of the city. Rumors were rife that the government planned to block popular text-messaging and social media services in the city to try to contain the hysteria. There was no official announcement from the government, however.
Meanwhile, ISIS and its Sunni allies continued capturing ground in areas disputed between Sunni and Shiite religious factions while the Iraqi army appeared irrelevant to the conflict.
Iranian and Iraqi news organizations were filled with reports that the commander of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps' al Quds Force, the cross between an intelligence agency and special forces that's often deployed to pursue Iranian foreign and security policy, had arrived in Baghdad to direct the fight against ISIS after four days that saw the army crumble.
Iranian Gen. Qassem Suleimani was, according to numerous credible reports, said to be directing the defenses of Baghdad personally. Suleimani, a well-known figure in Middle East security circles, is said to control Iranian operations in Iraq, Syria, Lebanon and the Gaza Strip. Supporters of Iran often credit him with devising the strategy that's salvaged the Syrian government of President Bashar Assad during the past year of civil war there.
On Friday, CNN reported that a senior Iraqi official had said that as many as 500 troops from the al Quds Force had begun arriving to help protect Baghdad. CNN said the official had said the Iranians would be deployed to Diyala province, a mixed Sunni and Shiite area, where their presence would generate less anger than in the mostly Sunni areas now under ISIS control.
A former European intelligence official, who runs a consultancy in the region and regularly deals with Iranian government representatives in the Persian Gulf and Afghanistan, said in an interview that he expected any Iranian troops sent to Iraq would augment what was already a robust covert presence.
“Hajj Qassem does not get taken by surprise, not next door to his own country,” the consultant said, asking that his own name not be used on such a sensitive subject. “Hajj” is an Islamic honorific.
The consultant said he suspected that ISIS's rapid advance hadn't surprised the Iranians. “I've been hearing about the problems with ISIS in the desert outside Mosul for a year and have been told the Iranians were warning Maliki about this,” he said.
The claim that the government of Prime Minister Nouri al Maliki had had ample warning of a serious problem, beyond the loss of the western desert of al Anbar nearly six months ago, also was made by a top security official of the peshmerga, the Kurdish militia.
“Especially in Nineveh, Salahuddin and Anbar governorates, the Iraqi security agencies and ministries have been incapable, and soldiers and employees were only interested in collecting their salaries,” Lt. Gen. Jabbar Yawar told a Kurdistan Regional Government website. He said Kurdish officials had warned that the security forces were poorly trained but “Baghdad did not heed the . . . warnings and now, unfortunately, our predictions have come to pass.”
He added that Kurdish officials had proposed that “several military bases be built in Anbar, Salahuddin and Mosul, particularly at the desert border areas” but that Maliki had ignored the suggestions. “Baghdad incorrectly interpreted our proposals as politically motivated and not in the public's interest,” he said.
The mustering of the Shiite community was to be expected: ISIS had issued a manifesto Thursday in Mosul, Iraq's second largest city, which it had captured Tuesday, calling for the destruction of all Shiite shrines.
Abu Zeinab said daily life was tense in Baghdad as people stocked supplies and in many cases gathered weapons to prepare for a siege as ISIS and Sunni forces were rumored to be within 20 miles or so of the capital.
“Iraqis have only known war and shortages for 30 years,” he said. “We know what to do.”
Official Iraqi forces, which were humiliated in the immediate fall of Mosul and have continued to defect or surrender when faced with ISIS attacks, were said to be holding firmly in the city of Samarra, just north of Baghdad, where the al Askari Mosque is one of Shiism's holiest shrines. They were bolstered by Shiite militias, including Assaih al Haq, a group trained by the Lebanese Shiite militant group Hezbollah that also helped the security forces fend off an ISIS attack on Samarra last month.
Some Iraqi media outlets were quoting officials as claiming that security forces had regained control of Tikrit, Saddam Hussein's hometown and a notorious anti-Shiite stronghold, but there was scant evidence to back that, and ISIS and its allies appeared to have moved even closer to the capital Friday, taking two key villages in Diyala province, adjacent to Baghdad.
In Mosul, an ongoing hostage drama involving as many as 80 Turkish nationals taken from a truck stop and from the Turkish consulate was reportedly escalating, according to Turkish media reports, with ISIS demanding $5 million to release the drivers and threatening to execute one an hour until the money arrives. Any demand for the dozens of consular officials has yet to be made public, although the Turkish government has expressed a willingness to talk with ISIS about their fate.
McClatchy special correspondent Joel Thomas contributed to this report from Ankara, Turkey.
The city of Quesnel is launching a new branding campaign aimed in part at attracting people fed up with the cost of living on the Lower Mainland.
"I think part of the issue for the North is that we're not speaking to that change that's occurring in the Lower Mainland right through the Okanagan," said Mayor Bob Simpson.
"People are struggling with the affordability issue. They're struggling with an unbalanced lifestyle. They're struggling with a desire to be engaged in more activities but they can't afford it anymore or they can't get to it because it takes them 45 minutes or an hour to get to the actual activity and then another 45 minutes to an hour to get back."
"We've got a story to tell where all of that is accessible."
'Gold Pan City' stuck in the past
Until now, Quesnel has positioned itself as "The Gold Pan City," a reference to its roots in the Cariboo gold rush of the 1860s.
Even Quesnel's giant gold pan will be part of the re-brand, with the city's new logo and tagline replacing the current text. (Wikimedia Commons)
Simpson says the new brand focuses on the city's future, rather than its past.
"The city was given quite a bit of feedback, especially from our business community, that Gold Pan City ... was dated and needed to be refreshed," he said.
He told the story of trying to recruit a doctor to move to Quesnel and discovering its online presence was getting in the way.
"The family of that physician was on the internet trying to figure out what Quesnel was and what we had to offer, and we were just really poorly positioned," he said.
'Quesnel: It's In Our Nature'
Based on this sort of feedback, the city partnered with a marketing group to come up with a new visual identity and slogan.
The City of Quesnel has commissioned a new brand in an effort to attract new residents to the central Interior town. (City of Quesnel)
After nearly a year of consultations, it is prepared to adopt a campaign centered around the line "Quesnel: It's in our nature."
"We live in nature. We're dependant upon nature for our economy, whether that's agriculture or forestry or mining our tourism," Simpson explained.
"But the other aspect of it is it's in our human nature to be an inviting, friendly community and to be a community that will thrive."
Quesnel Mayor Bob Simpson hopes to grow his city's population in part by attracting residents fed up with the cost of living on the Lower Mainland. (bobsimpsonformayor.ca)
Simpson said the new identity comes with a new logo, a new visual identity for promotional materials and a new website aimed at attracting new residents and retaining existing ones.
"We think that we are on the cusp of actually growing the population base of our community because we have some of the most affordable housing in the Pacific Northwest. We have amenities that can compete with amenities in larger communities," he said.

Some pharmaceutical companies are troubled by stratospheric drug prices. Several have vowed to limit price hikes, for instance. And the powerful drug lobbying group PhRMA is at least trying to distract consumers' attention away from price gouging by dangling shiny advertisements about their life-saving research.
But there are some companies that just don't care. Mylan appears to be one of those.
Despite intense backlash from customers and advocates, several federal investigations, and blustering lawmakers, the company has yet to drop the soaring price of its epinephrine auto-injectors, EpiPen, as The New York Times pointed out this weekend. The paper sat down with 10 former high-ranking executives and Mylan's current CEO Heather Bresch to try to understand their perspective.
According to the former employees, who requested anonymity citing nondisclosure agreements and fears of retaliation, Mylan expected outrage over its price hiking ways and planned to simply ignore it. In fact, the former executives revealed that after employees repeatedly warned about the potential for public counterblasts, the company's chairman, Robert Coury was unmoved.
His response was summarized in this charming passage:
Mr. Coury replied that he was untroubled. He raised both his middle fingers and explained, using colorful language, that anyone criticizing Mylan, including its employees, ought to go copulate with themselves. Critics in Congress and on Wall Street, he said, should do the same. And regulators at the Food and Drug Administration? They, too, deserved a round of anatomically challenging self-fulfillment.
Coury, who received around $160 million in compensation last year from Mylan , declined to discuss the matter. But Bresch defended Mylan's culture and price increases to the Times. She again deflected blame for the high prices onto the country's complicated and inefficient healthcare system. She also vaunted Mylan's generic version of the EpiPen, which the company released after the backlash began. A generic two-pack costs around $300 , down from the brand-name version's $600 price tag. Before Mylan purchased the devices in 2007, a two-pack went for around $100.
Mylan made $1.1 billion in revenue per year from EpiPen sales (though that may be decreasing with the introduction of new competition, including CVS's generic auto-injector). And the company's executives have the highest salaries in the business.
Though Mylan may be an extreme outlier in the business, others are continuing on with price increases amid the public furor. A financial report from Friday indicated that Pfizer Inc. has ratcheted up the price of nearly a hundred drugs by an average of 20 percent so far this year, Reuters noted
Still, others are heeding consumers' outrage. French drugmaker Sanofi pledged that it wouldn't increase drug prices beyond the rate of healthcare inflation. And AbbVie, Allergan, and Novo Nordisk have vowed to keep price increases in the single digits per year.

NEW DELHI: With the first anniversary of demonetisation approach­ing, the government has raised the pitch to prove that its decisi­o­n to ban high-value notes has worked and the f­ight against black money and corruption would contin­­u­e unabated.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi, speaking at a poll rally in Himachal Pradesh on Sunday, claimed that over three lakh shell companies have downed shutters as a direct result of demonetisation. Fraud to the tune of Rs 4,000 crore has been detected during a probe into 5,000 such firms, he added. And, more such cases could tumble out going forward as investigations progress in other firms.
Meanwhile, the Corporate Affairs Ministry on Sunday issued a detailed statement with numbers supporting this claim. It said cash deposits worth Rs 17,000 crore were put into the bank accounts of some 35,000 companies, which were later struck off the government records for not following rules. It added that these deposits were later withdrawn, hinting at possible laundering of dirty money.
In a major anti-black money drive by the Ministry of Corporate Affairs, nearly 2.24 lakh companies have been struck-off for remaining inactive for a period of two years or more and 3.09 lakh Directors have been disqualified who were on the Board of Companies that did not file Annual Returns for three financial years.
Preliminary Enquiry on the basis of information received from 56 banks in respect of 35,000 companies involving 58,000 accounts has revealed that an amount of over Rs. 17,000 crore was deposited and withdrawn post-demonetization.
The ministry's note narrates one particular incident, in which a company had a negative opening balance on Nov 8, 2016 — the day demonetisation was announced — but deposited, and withdrew, as much as Rs 2,484 crore post the note ban.
In the initial days of demonetisation, the government had put restrictions on the amount of money that could be deposited and withdrawn through bank accounts. To surmount this, firms with unaccounted money tried many tricks, including opening multiple bank accounts. Subsequent probes detected many companies operating as many as 100 bank accounts. In one curious case, a company was found to have a whopping 2,134 accounts to deposit and withdraw cash.“With respect to deregistered companies, state governments have been advised to disallow registration of properties of such entities,” the Corporate Affairs Ministry said.
The information with respect to such companies have been shared with enforcement authorities, including Central Board of Direct Taxes(CBDT), Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU), Department of Financial Services (DFS) and Reserve Bank of India (RBI) for further necessary action. Companies have also been identified for inquiry/inspection/investigation under the Companies Act, 2013 and necessary action is underway, the Government said.
The Government has also undertaken a major exercise to strengthen the regulatory mechanisms including provision for penalising the erring professionals.
“With a view to checking the problem of Dummy Directors, action is underway to seed DIN with PAN and Aadhaar at the stage of DIN application through biometric matching for new applications. The same may be extended to legacy data in due course,” the Government said in a release.
With a view to strengthen regulatory mechanism, a separate initiative is underway to develop a State-of-the-Art software application to put in place an 'Early Warning System' (EWS), which will be housed in Serious Fraud Investigation Office (SFIO).
Following the action of striking-off defaulting companies, restrictions have been imposed on operation of their bank accounts.
Apart from the restrictions on bank accounts, action has also been taken to restrict sale and transfer of moveable and immoveable properties of struck-off companies until they are restored. The State Governments have been advised to take necessary action in this regard by disallowing registration of such transactions, the statement said.
The Prime Minister's Office has constituted a Special Task Force (STF) under the Joint Chairmanship of Revenue Secretary and Secretary, Corporate Affairs, to oversee the drive against such defaulting companies with the help of various enforcement agencies. The Special Task Force has so far met five times and action has been initiated against several defaulting companies, which is expected to help in the drive against black money.
Preliminary enquiry has revealed that over 3,000 disqualified Directors were Directors in more than 20 companies each, which is beyond the limit prescribed under the law.
“In the light of the evidence relating to abuse of the Corporate Structure through multi-layering, not more than two layers are now permitted beyond the wholly owned subsidiary. This is in addition to the existing restriction which prohibits a company to make investment through more than two layers of investment companies,” the release further said.
In order to address the criminality angle, the Director, Additional Director or Assistant Director of SFIO has been recently authorized to arrest any person believed to be guilty of any fraud punishable under the Act. Under Section 447 of the Act, which defines fraud, stringent punishment including imprisonment up to 10 years is stipulated. Further, reference has been made to the Ministry of Finance to include it as a Scheduled Offence under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act, according to the release.
The Government has also constituted a High Level Committee (HLC) for suggesting revamp of the disciplinary systems of Chartered Accountants, Company Secretaries and Cost Accountants. Steps are underway for setting-up National Financial Reporting Authority (NFRA), an independent body, to check Financial Statements, prescribed Accounting Standards and take disciplinary action against errant professionals.
The US Defence Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) has announced a new programme that aims to eliminate the need for antibiotics by increasing individual tolerance to pathogens.
The Technologies for Host Resilience (THoR) programme will address the ever-growing issue of antibiotic-resistant strains of pathogens by exploring the fundamental biology of host tolerance in animal populations. If successful, the programme will be expanded to treat humans in the future.
The agency has stated that developing new medical countermeasures to multi-drug resistant pathogens is a "national security priority", and follows a White House report in March outlining the threat posed by antibiotic-resistant bacteria.
DARPA's THoR programme objectives: 1) Discover Tolerant Populations: Perform animal studies to examine intra- and inter-species differences in host fitness; identify sub-populations and species that are tolerant to infection. 2) Identify Biological Mechanisms of Tolerance: Define and characterize the basis for tolerance across multiple biological scales, e.g., species, tissues and cells. 3) Identify and Validate Pro-Tolerance Interventions: Recreate tolerance mechanisms in susceptible animal populations.
The issue has reached such a critical level that the World Health Organisation (WHO) labelled it "an increasingly serious threat to global public health that requires action across all government sectors and society".
Antibiotic resistant strains have arisen due to the prevalence of antibiotics being used to treat a range of infections and viruses, from tuberculosis to gonorrhoea. While an effective treatment, new resistant strains are able to evolve making future antibiotic use ineffective.
"Our aim with THoR is to lay the foundation for new treatments that would enable the body to more easily and safely cope with infection," said Matt Hepburn, a programme manager at DARPA.
"Among other potential advantages, these new treatments would prevent the body's overreaction to infection and buy time for the individual's natural recovery mechanisms to kick in. We want to help patients 'weather the storm' during the critical phases of acute illness."
Potential participants for the THoR programme will be reviewed at a Proposers Day on 27 April in Denver, Colorado.
In 2006, Assistant U.S. Attorney Brett Grayson lined up more than 30 jailhouse informants to testify that they had sold drugs to Church Point, Louisiana homemaker Ann Colomb and her three sons. (I wrote about the Colomb case in the May 2008 issue of Reason.) Grayson had used some of these snitches before, in the trial of a Houston drug kingpin. After the Houston trial, Grayson was notified that several of his informants had lied, and that there may have been an information sharing network and perjury ring inside the federal prison system. No matter. Grayson used them again. Colomb and her sons were convicted, and spent three months in prison.
The Colombs were eventually freed, with all charges dismissed. Grayson's jailhouse snitches had lied again, and this time, federal judge Tucker Melancon ordered an investigation into new evidence that, somehow, portions of Grayson's case file were being distributed through federal prisons in Texas and Louisiana. The Colombs, meanwhile, spent their life savings on their defense, and were never compensated. According to defense attorneys, Grayson said at one point during the trial that it didn't matter if he personally believed his snitch witnesses, it only mattered what the jury believed, a notion he articulated again in his closing argument.
I thought about the Colomb case while reading the transcript of the oral arguments in Pottawattamie v. Maghee, heard last Wednesday before the U.S. Supreme Court (read my previous column on the case here). The case turns on whether prosecutors who knowingly fabricate evidence to convict an innocent person should be susceptible to lawsuits, or if prosecutors should always have absolute immunity from such suits, no matter how bad their behavior.
During the hearing, Deputy Solicitor General Neal Katyal argued that "if prosecutors have to worry at trial that every act they undertake will somehow open up the door to liability, then they will flinch in the performance of their duties and not introduce that evidence." Katyal made similar statements throughout the hearing: "When someone is introducing evidence at trial, you don't want to chill them in the performance of their duties in any way," and "the overriding interest is protecting the judicial process and not letting information be chilled and not come in." Chief Justice John Roberts underlined that formulation, twice inquiring as to the "chilling" effect of stripping immunity for prosecutors.
It took new Associate Justice Sonia Sotomayor to make the obvious point: We want prosecutors to "flinch" before introducing evidence they suspect might not be true. In fact, we want them to not introduce that evidence at all. And there should be a chilling effect on misconduct as egregious as coaching witnesses to lie. If Brett Grayson had known he could be held liable for his parade of lying jailhouse snitches, perhaps he'd have vetted their stories a bit more carefully, or been more vigilant about ensuring that portions of his case file didn't somehow get passed around the prison system.
The amount of liability the would-be plaintiffs in Powattattamie want prosecutors to shoulder is minimal. The Supreme Court has held for 30 years that even prosecutors who knowingly withhold exculpatory evidence in a case that results in the conviction of an innocent person can't be sued for damages. The wrongfully convicted men in Powattattamie aren't even seeking to undo that. They're asking that prosecutors who knowingly fabricate evidence against an innocent person, then use that evidence at trial, be susceptible to a lawsuit. And even there, prosecutors would still be afforded the qualified immunity given to police officers, which means potential plaintiffs would still have a high hurdle to clear before getting into court. (It's worth noting that the prosecutors in Powattattamie weren't sanctioned or disciplined in any way, which is about par for the course in the criminal justice system.)
The problem here is that the Supreme Court has painted itself into a corner. While the Court has always upheld absolute immunity for prosecutors while trying a case, it has ruled that prosecutors who help investigate a case—that is, who act as police officers—should receive the same, reduced qualified immunity given to cops. But here's where it gets messy. At what point is a prosecutor acting as a prosecutor, and at what point is he acting like a cop? The roles have been muddied over the years.
Consider snitch testimony. Under federal law, only a federal prosecutor, and not a federal police investigator, can gauge whether information offered by a jailhouse snitch is useful enough to offer time off the informant's sentence in exchange for his testimony. That means prosecutors are put in the role of interviewing potential informants to determine whether the stories are plausible (or, if they're less scrupulous, merely whose stories are most damaging to the defendant). This is more the role of an investigator than the prosecutor of a case.
Solicitor General Katyal and the attorney for the prosecutors in Powattattamie both made the absurd argument that the actual injury in Powattattamie occured when the defendants were wrongly convicted and jailed, not when the evidence against them was manufactured. Therefore, because the prosecutors were acting in their role as triers of the case when the injury occurred, they should be immune to lawsuit, even though they were acting as investigators when they conjured up the perjured testimony in the first place. Had they passed the evidence off to another prosecutor for trial, they could still be sued. This led Justice Anthony Kennedy to ask, "so the law is the more deeply you're involved in the wrong, the more likely you are to be immune? That's a strange proposition."
It certainly is. Katyal went so far as to argue that even police officers who manufacture evidence used to convict an innocent person may not be liable, so long as they tell the prosecutor ahead of time that the evidence has been faked—again because the actual injury occurs at the time of conviction, and at the time of conviction the state actor inflicting the damage is the prosecutor acting in his role as prosecutor, at which point he has immunity. Kennedy reiterated the problem: "Again, the more aggravated the tort, the greater the immunity."
Katyal went on to argue that there is no "free-standing due process right not to be framed," a striking line that made it around the Internet last week. If you're a constitutional originalist, that statement isn't quite as controversial as it first sounds: An originalist may believe that the Constitution protects us from government overreach, but it doesn't explicitly lay out a method of recovering damages for government violations of our rights; that's left up to Congress.
The problem with the originalist interpretation is that the Constitution's authors surely would have hoped for and expected at least some relief. The Bill of Rights both establishes a civil courts system to allow citizens to recover damages from one another, and lays out a clear set of rights that government officials aren't permitted to abrogate. It makes little sense to think, then, that the document would be consistent with the notion that government officials could systematically violate two citizens' rights in a way that resulted in significant injury (in this case, 26 years in prison), and yet be wholly immune from those citizens' efforts to collect damages, simply because Congress failed to legislate a path to relief.
One of the notable things about this case is that the pro-law enforcement position was argued by Katyal, an official in the Obama administration, while the pro-defense, anti-executive branch position was argued by Paul Clement, the former solicitor general for the Bush administration. The Obama administration has consistently taken the pro-prosecution side in criminal justice cases since Obama took office, confirming that where the rubber meets the road on issues related to police powers and the rights of the accused, what matters most is not political ideology but who holds the reins of power.
Clement's toughest questioning came from the Court's two Bush appointees, Chief Justice Roberts and Justice Samuel Alito. But Clement rather brilliantly concluded his time with a direct challenge to the two Bush-appointed justices that probably won't affect either's ruling, but at least ought to make them squirm. Keeping prosecutors immune from liability, he argued, is a classic case of judicial activism.
The phrase "absolute immunity" appears nowhere in the Constitution, nor does it appear in Section 1983, a part of the federal criminal code that provides a way for citizens to collect damages against the government. The Court read absolute immunity into the law in the 1976 case Imbler v. Pachtman because it feared the ramifications of prosecutors being susceptible to lawsuits. As Clement argued, there is "no common law support at all for absolute immunity. And I wouldn't think that this Court was particularly interested in coming up with implied immunities that aren't in the statute and had no basis at the common law, and that's why I think some of the Justices that have looked at this as an original matter have tended to be quite reluctant in recognizing absolute immunity because it lacks support in the text."
So while for most of the hearing the Court and litigants took absolute immunity as a given and debated whether and how to carve exceptions into it, Clement concluded by pulling the sheet back on absolute immunity, period. In doing so, he cleared a path for the justices to revoke absolute immunity altogether, or at least severely limit the concept. That almost certainly won't happen. But it should (but probably won't) give the Court's conservative wing some cover to at least poke enough holes in prosecutorial immunity to discourage the more egregious examples of misconduct.

YouTube/NBC On Tuesday's "Late Night with Seth Meyers," the host used his "The Check In" segment to once again criticize President Donald Trump, but this time for an issue that's getting less attention than some others: poor treatment of veterans.
The segment started with some clips of Trump bragging about his support of veterans during his campaign. Lines include "I love those vets" and "there's nobody better at the military than I am."
Before getting into the criticism of Trump's impact on veterans, Meyers gave the president "serious credit" for donating over a million dollars to building a Vietnam Memorial in New York City, which was completed in 1985. Meyers even gave him another compliment when addressing Trump's concern with the Department of Veterans Affairs:
"Throughout his campaign, Trump constantly brought attention to problems at the [Department of Veterans Affairs], specifically how poorly it is run. And he's right about that. One of the main problems at the VA is that many departments — including VA hospitals — are chronically understaffed. But one of Trump's first moves as president was to put a freeze on federal hiring," Meyers said.
Then Meyers dove right into the negative effects that Trump's inauguration day hiring freeze has had on veterans.
"Veterans get preference when it comes to federal hiring in general. And according to advocacy groups, several veterans have already had job interviews canceled or postponed," Meyers said.
Meyers told the story of a 30-year-old veteran who was supposed to start work at a government agency, but thanks to the hiring freeze, the start date was postponed "indefinitely." After trying to follow through on a definitive start date, the verteran was told, "There's nothing we can do."
Meyers then suggested that Trump is signing executive orders without thinking about consequences and leaving "a trail of chaos."

It turns out there already is an Atlanta United FC.
On Thursday, SI's Brian Straus reported that Atlanta's expansion MLS side would go by Atlanta United FC. The name was roundly mocked for its lack of originality — there's already a DC United, and Minnesota United FC is another MLS expansion side set to join the league — but people also discovered there was another problem with the name: Another team already had it.
Meet Atlanta United FC, an amateur soccer team founded in 2008 that competed in the Atlanta District Amateur Soccer League and now plays in a Sunday night league.
They have two very adorable ball boys, which is more than I can say for the MLS side.
The team didn't immediately respond to an email requesting comment.
Hall of Famer Fred Biletnikoff knows a thing or two about football, wide receivers in particular.
During his 14-year NFL career, Biletnikoff hauled in 589 passes for 8,974 passes and 76 touchdowns – winning a Super Bowl in the process – and is currently the franchise's second-leading receiver.
Earlier this week he was available via conference call, discussing the 12th Annual Fred Biletnikoff Hall of Fame Invitational golf tournament, but while the call was mostly about the upcoming tournament, he also spoke about the current state of the Silver and Black.
Biletnikoff believes the Raiders' front office is building a competitive team.
“I really feel, [Head Coach] Jack [Del Rio] and the entire coaching staff and [General Manager] Reggie [McKenzie], they've brought something back to the Raiders that had been missing for a number of years, as we all know. To be able to see the excitement with the fans, and obviously with the players and seeing the excitement with them and how they're out there competing, and really competing to win, and they're all dedicated to the program. It looks like they love Jack. I believe that Jack was such a great fit to come in here and be the head coach. I was really happy about that, believe me, when that happened, but it's just a whole different atmosphere.”
The Silver and Black are close to returning to the postseason.
“One thing that everybody saw last year, is the fact that, these guys are right there. They have a chance. They really have a great chance to keep winning, and to get in the playoffs, and be a great team. They have a good nucleus.”
Signing Sean Smith was a big move for the Raiders' secondary.
“I like bringing in the corner [Smith] from Kansas City over to the Raiders. I like that. I love seeing that. You need corners. That's the bottom line, and that kid's a hell of a player, and then with the entire group there's youth on the team and they're all outstanding players.”
Biletnikoff believes things are looking up on the offensive side of the ball too.
Author Lt Col Robert Keith Gunther concludes his fascinating look back at events of 51 years ago and the State Funeral of President John F Kennedy. Here he looks at the role played by the pipe band of the United States Air Force in that defining moment in history….
The USAF Pipe Band was originally founded in 1950 by Colonel George S. Howard. An article from September 13, 1963, states that it was composed ‘exclusively of players of Scottish and Irish ancestry, attired in authentic kilts of the Mitchell tartan. The band alternated playing with the bugle section of the USAF Drum and Bugle Corps while on the march and during field exhibitions'.
According to U.S. Air Force Piper Jerry Cashion, the USAF Pipe Band was in New Orleans when JFK was assassinated. The band had arrived the day before, toured Bourbon Street, and now the men were relaxing in Navy barracks. They were preparing for an evening show when they were given the bad news. The Pipe Major received a call from Washington ordering the band's immediate return to Bolling Air Force Base.
In Geoff Redick's article ‘Local Bagpiper recalls JFK's funeral', Piper Cashion said, ‘We were in a gymnasium, ready to play a job down in New Orleans, Louisiana, and we were getting dressed, ready to go. An announcement came over the loudspeaker that Kennedy had been shot. Immediately, they packed us up and brought us back to Washington, D.C. We had to stay on base all weekend, and learn this new tune they told us we had to play ‘Mist Covered Mountain'. The band learned it quickly and practiced the ceremonial march ahead of the funeral on November 25 during that cold Monday. Because of the President's fondness for pipe music, The USAF Pipe Band was directed to play at the interment ceremony.
‘Monday, November 25 turned out to be a bright, sunny, but a very cold day. The band reported to Arlington in the early morning for a run-through of the graveside ceremonies to take place later that day.'
‘We rehearsed in our full outfits and it was cold as hell,' recalled Sgt. John Bosworth. After their dry run, the band moved to an area near the Old Amphitheater to run through the music and marching one more time to ensure perfection.
The band then positioned themselves on the hill in front of the Custis-Lee Mansion. It was a perfect viewpoint from which to watch the magnificent, solemn, pageantry of a State Funeral unfold. Sergeant Bosworth related that they were waiting for about an hour and a half and could see each marching unit as it approached the gates to Arlington National Cemetery. Upon arrival of the cortege at Arlington, the Marine band began the graveside rites with ruffles and flourishes and the National Anthem. When it ended, the Air Force pipe band began.
Irving Lowens wrote: ‘At 2:43 p.m as the coffin was moved from the caisson to the burial site, the Air Force Pipers played the Mist Covered Mountains. The band slowly marched by the grave and onto the street. They were led by Drum Major Seamus (Jim) Neary. ‘Overhead, fifty jet fighters flew in formation followed by Air Force One. After the funeral, the band returned to Bolling Air Force Base with the knowledge that they had contributed to a momentous event.' The USAF Pipe Band performance (and the 50 jets flying overhead) can be watched at 32 mins, 27 secs into this 34-minute clip: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KJQkn6zUvM.
As stated in the ‘Last Salute', ‘In a wide departure from customary graveside procedure in which a band, standing fast in formation, plays an appropriate hymn as the casket is carried from the caisson to the grave, Mrs. Kennedy preferred that the Air Force Bagpipe Band march past the gravesite playing Mist Covered Mountain while the movement of the casket was taking place. The Air Force group was so scheduled, and a route permitting the group to perform as requested was marked out at the gravesite.'
Piper Cashion: ‘Being at the graveside, piping, I think the thing that got me the most was the 50 thunder jets that flew over, right after we played. It was very moving. And I was very proud to be there.'
The USAF Pipe Band Roster for the JFK State Funeral included (as originally lined up) SSgt James Neary, Drum Major, SSgt N. B. ‘Sandy' Jones, A1C Tom Kirkpatrick, TSgt Melvin (‘Mel') Ross, SrA ‘Jack' McGilvary, TSgt George Lucas, A1C Jerry Cashion, SrA Robert (‘Bob') Fulton, SrA Richard (‘Dick') Rau, SSgt John Ryan, SSgt Leroy Carroll (Bass Drum), SrA Ward Willis, SSgt John G. Bosworth.
Drum Major James ‘Seamus' Neary, the son of an Irish immigrant, was also a piper, but ended up as the USAF Pipe Band Drum Major. Neary actually started out in the U.S. Army as a piper from 1955-1958 with the 2nd Army Pipe Band. He then joined the USAF Pipes & Drums from 1958-1976. He recalls the first time playing for JFK was when he was President-Elect in an Ice Arena. Neary was friends with Liam Clancy and Tommy Makem and details a party the famous Irish folk singers came to with the USAF band after their performance at the JFK White House on St. Patrick's Day 1963.
Norval ‘Sandy' Jones, according to the North American Academy of Piping website, began piping at the age of eight under George Mars of Victoria, British Columbia, Canada. He served as the Pipe Major for the U.S. Air Force band for eight years. As a member of the pipe band he often performed for Presidents, Heads of State, and dignitaries of foreign nations. During his tenure in the air force he continued his studies of the bagpipe with Jack Chisholm of Inverness, Scotland, and John MacFadyen. In 1970, he and John MacFadyen, co-founded the North American Academy of Piping. Sandy is the author of the tutor ‘Beginning the Bagpipe‘. He travels throughout North America judging at Highland games, conducting workshops, and performing at recitals. He retired from The Citadel in Charleston, SC, where he taught bagpipes for 25 years. Currently he is active with the Grandfather Mountain Highland Games and the Charleston Scottish Games.
[easyrotator]erc_14_1414056032[/easyrotator]Gerald Cashion joined the USAF Pipe Band in 1960. In 1961, Cushion was chosen to be a White House piper on call for ceremonial duties . Upon leaving the military, he returned to Glens Falls, New York, where he taught English for thirty years. During that time, he was Pipe Major of the Adirondack Pipes and Drums of Glens Falls, as well as the Galloway Pipe Band. He was taught by Hugh MacInnes and Sandy Jones.
Piper Tom Kirkpatrick, from Glens Falls, NY, also played that day. From 1960-1965, he was part of many events at the White House such as the state dinner for the Prime Minister of Ireland and the Dulles Airport Dedication Ceremony.
Piper Robert Fulton was one of only two sword dancers the band ever had during its existence. He learned the pipes from John Irvin, 1st Battalion Queens Own Cameron Highlanders in 1952. Fulton played with the Caledonian Pipe Band of Cleveland, Ohio, from 1952 until 1960. Piper Fulton learned the Sword Dance, Broad Swords, Highland Fling, Hornpipe and Sean Truibhais from one of the dancers that danced with the Caledonian Pipe Band.
Drum Sergeant John Bosworth retired from the USAF band in 1984 as a Senior Master Sergeant and is still quite active as a percussionist. The drum he used in the Kennedy funeral was on display at Arlington National Cemetery for three years, according to www.tapsbugler.com.
On November 16 last year, former members of the U.S. Air Force band, some of whom played at JFK's funeral in 1963, held a commemoration (above). This gathering also honoured the memory of Army bandsman Keith C. Clark, who played Taps at the funeral 50 years ago.

Conclusion
Although collective memory of the JFK presidency culminates with the sound of the great Highland bagpipe carrying this much-loved young American President to his early grave, our instrument's sound and music were also heard during the numerous colourful days of his presidency. Pipers were present at the first and last official state events and at numerous others in between. Our instrument was heard during the brightest days of President Kennedy's administration and added to the splendour of his ‘Camelot'. The most celebrated moment was the Black Watch performance on the South Lawn I wrote about in my last excerpt. The bagpipe's presence during the state funeral reflected the high regard the instrument was held in by the Kennedy family, amply demonstrated by the unprecedented honour of inclusion of a foreign military unit in the State Funceral ceremony.
Through these articles I hope I have established that the idea that there was only one pipe band at the funeral is incorrect. There were two distinct units, the Black Watch pipers and the USAF Pipe Band.
The Highland bagpipe's prominence during the Kennedy Presidency should be historically re-evaluated in order to correct its image in the eyes of Americans. Unfortunately, we still only associate this versatile instrument with funerals, whilst in Scotland it is often present at all types of social and public events. Perhaps this because of our memories of President Kennedy's funeral. My hope is that this series will dispel the incorrect notions surrounding our instrument and correctly reflect its prominent, and respected position during the Kennedy presidency.

No less a figure that Major Steven Small, the Director of Army Bagpipe Music here in the UK, has praised his work (see comment last excerpt). Major Small is not alone in expressing his gratitude to Lt Col Gunther. If you feel so inclined please pass on your thanks below.
Your Liberty City adventures will continue this Fall on the Xbox 360, as Rockstar Games has announced Grand Theft Auto: The Ballad of Gay Tony as the game's second downloadable episode.
In contrast to Grand Theft Auto IV's seedy biker gang expansion The Lost and Damned, The Ballad of Gay Tony is said to focus on the glitzy "high-end night life" of Liberty City. The second Xbox 360 exclusive episode will put players in the role of Luis Lopez, confirming previous rumors, as his part-time hoodlum duties are supplemented by full-time work for nightclub impresario Tony "Gay Tony" Prince.
According to the official announcement, "players will struggle with the competing loyalties of family and friends, and with the uncertainty about who is real and who is fake in a world in which everyone has a price."
Grand Theft Auto: The Ballad of Gay Tony is slated to release on Xbox Live this Fall for $19.99 USD or 1600 Microsoft Points.
President Obama has adopted Republican tax policies he knows to be disastrous for the nation. Obama never learned, or forgot, one of the essential lessons of junior high school -- how to deal with bullies. (This is proof positive that he is a native-born American -- he never would have survived Kenyan bullies.) Here is the Washington Post's summary of Obama's explanation of why he had no choice but to capitulate to Republican efforts to reduce taxes for the wealthiest one percent.
Obama said he had little choice but to compromise because he has been unable to persuade Senate Republicans to maintain middle-class tax cuts without also extending the top-tier tax rates for another two years - even though a majority of Americans agree tax cuts on high incomes should end.
Obama summed up his view of why the Republican's position on tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans left him helpless to fulfill his promises to prevent the cuts: "I'm not here to play games with the American people or the health of our economy." No, you're there to prevent any leader, foreign or domestic, from harming the American people and our economy. The way that leaders harm us is by "playing games" -- which means that they act strategically to obtain their interests at our expense. The President of the U.S., therefore, has to be expert at recognizing and courageous and tenacious in countering these strategies.
Bullies play a well known game. Their strategy is to intimidate. Sometimes they threaten us directly sometimes they threaten those we care about. By the age of 14 we have all identified who the bullies are, figured out their strategy, and learned that one cannot "persuade" them to act appropriately. The only way to stop a bully is to "play games" -- to act strategically. They must be confronted and this can, we can all attest from personal experience, be painful. Bullies are cowards and most people hate bullies and will form alliances to stop them. Obama, as is his norm, raged at those who would have been his allies against the bullies. Giving in to bullies guarantees that they will act ever more abusively.
Obama thinks he can "persuade" Senate Republicans who are "playing games" about tax cuts. Their strategic (non)negotiating position is that unless they get tax cuts for the top one percent no American will get tax cuts (or any other necessary legislation). They are holding 99% of Americans hostage to benefit the top one percent. Obama thinks that if the Republicans play games he is helpless to resist them no matter how harmful his capitulation will be to the nation.
David Cay Johnston spelled out the winning strategy for the nation in his recent column ("Call Their Bluff, Mr. President"). The Republicans' tax strategy was straight out of Blazing Saddles -- the part where the sheriff is surrounded and responds by taking out his gun, pointing it at his head, and telling the crowd not to move or "I'll shoot." The absurdity of the strategy and the idiocy of the crowd in falling for it is the gag. The Republicans tax strategy involved pointing a triple-barreled gun at their own heads. They were threatening to (1) vote to prevent a tax cut to over 100 million Americans (during a weak recovery from the Great Recession); (2) refuse (two weeks before Christmas) to extend unemployment benefits for millions of long-term unemployed; and, (3) and they were doing all this for the benefit of the wealthiest one percent (which all the polls showed was contrary to the will of Americans). The chances that the Republican Party would pull the trigger on the three-barreled gun they had aimed at their own head was minimal. Indeed, if the Republican leadership did pull the trigger they would be discredited and would have to rush to undo their tax and unemployment policies before the entire Republican Party became anathema to independents and middle and working class Americans. President Clinton, of course, called their bluff on shutting down the government, and turned around his Presidency. Obama, not so much.
White House flacks have had some success in generating columns in the New York Times and the Washington Post claiming that Obama deserves respect for obtaining more stimulus dollars by adopting the Republican proposals. Both of these columns are premised on the false assumption that Obama couldn't call the Republican bluff and produce far more effective stimulus legislation.
But one of the articles the administration flacks influenced reveals something even worse about Obama than his latest Blazing Saddles moment. It turns out that Obama was acting strategically when he capitulated to tax policies that will add greatly to the nation's already record income inequality. Obama's flacks' pitch to the Washington Post is that Obama was playing (political) games his advisors believed would increase his personal chances of reelection.
President Obama's willingness to extend all of the George W. Bush-era tax cuts is part of what White House officials say is a deliberate strategy: to demonstrate his ability to compromise with Republicans and portray the president as the last reasonable man in a sharply partisan Washington.
Note to President Obama: you misunderstand your position description. An adult who repeatedly gives in to a bully is a coward, not "reasonable." Do you realize that the Republicans have been calling you a coward with regard to your foreign policies for two years and that they hold you in utter contempt? That is why they believed they could get away with bullying you in Congress despite your large majorities in both Houses. I guarantee that they have view your falling for their Blazing Saddles threat to commit suicide as the ultimate demonstration of that your administration has descended into farce.
Your job is not to get reelected. Your job is not to work on your "portrayal." Your job is to prevent bad tax policies you (correctly) said threatened our democracy, economy, and society. You are failing at your job.
Mother Mary Angelica of the Annunciation, a Catholic nun who started a TV station in a garage that grew into a religious media giant, died on Easter Sunday, according to her company.
She was 92.
Mother Angelica launched Eternal Word Television Network (EWTN) in 1981 a few years after falling out with a manager at a TV station whose studio she had been using to produce programs.
From its humble beginnings in a garage at an Alabama monastery, EWTN expanded over the years into an influential TV, radio and online operation. Its channels now broadcast to 264 million households around the world, according to its website.

"Mother Angelica is the only woman in the history of television to found and lead a cable network for 20 years," Raymond Arroyo, the managing editor of EWTN's news division, said in a video statement.
Angelica appeared regularly on the network, hosting "Mother Angelica Live," a show on which she led religious discussions with TV viewers.
"She founded and grew a network that appealed to everyday Catholics, understood their needs and fed their spirits," Archbishop Charles Chaput of Philadelphia, a member of the network's board of governors, told EWTN News.
After stepping down from leading EWTN in the early 2000s, Angelica suffered a stroke that impaired her speech and limited her mobility, Arroyo said.
EWTN's success was recognized by the leaders of the Catholic Church. In 2009, Pope Benedict XVI awarded one of the Vatican's top honors to Angelica and the network's former chairman for their work.
Social media lit up over the news she had died. Her name was trending late Sunday on Facebook and Twitter, where users circulated announcements of her death, links to obituaries and their own goodbyes.

Barcelona Striker linked with exit
The ball has been firmly placed in Neymar's court by former Barcelona captain Carles Puyol, who insisted that the forward must step up and clarify the situation.
He has largely been a silent figure so far this summer as he continues to be linked with a Camp Nou exit.
Paris Saint-Germain appears to be the likely destination for the Brazilian, who has not yet made any public declaration about his future, much to Puyol's chagrin.
"I don't know what's going to happen with Neymar. He needs to talk and explain what he wants to do because I can't control him or speak for him," said the former defender.
"The decision needs to be made by him. I'm not responsible for the club so I don't know if they have already decided on what they're going to do.
"I'm not sure if he dreams of leaving but it is getting harder for a player to spend his entire career with one team. Football is changing, even though there are special cases like Lionel Messi, Sergio Busquets and Andres Iniesta."
Last year was not a successful one for the Blaugrana, something which Puyol acknowledged, but he believes that the hiring of Ernesto Valverde puts them in a strong position to bounce straight back.
"Things were tough for Barcelona last season. You can't always win but winning the Copa doesn't compare with LaLiga or the Champions League," he added.
"Winning a trophy is always nice though and they will want to win everything again this year. The team won lots of titles with Luis Enrique and he did a great job.
"Now, there is a new man in charge and the ideas of the team won't change. He will have his nuances, as with every coach, but largely the philosophy remains the same.
"Valverde's teams have always played well so we will see how it goes. He has a spectacular squad and I'm sure they'll be fighting for everything."
BEIRUT, Lebanon — The Syrian government has increased the size of the territory under its control by two and a half times in just two months, Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu said Sunday, as Syrian forces backed by regional allies and the Russian air force seized thousands of square kilometers from the Islamic State group in the center of the country.
Syrian government forces supported by Iranian-organized militias and the Russian air force have recaptured much of the country's central Homs province from the Islamic State group in 2017. Most of the province is desert. It contains several energy fields as well as phosphate minerals.
They are driving toward the city of Deir el-Zour, kept under siege by IS militants since 2015.

Shoigu, in an interview on Russian state-owned Rossiya 24 TV, said recapturing Deir el-Zour “will say a lot, if not everything, about the end of the battle with” the Islamic State group.
The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights monitoring group reported on Sunday that government forces killed at least 25 IS militants in a commando operation in the desert region. It said the soldiers rappelled down from helicopters to ambush the militants, under the cover of Russian air strikes.
Russia has provided air support for Syrian forces combating rebels and the Islamic State group since 2015.
Elsewhere, a rebel faction said it killed 20 army soldiers outside the Syrian capital in a tunnel blast as the battle for Damascus's northeastern suburbs showed no signs of letting up.
Wael Olwan, spokesman for the Failaq al-Rahman faction, said the operation took place before dawn Sunday.
The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights monitoring group said 16 soldiers were reported missing because of the blast.
A Russian mediated cease-fire announced last month has failed to quell the fighting between the government and rebels on the northeastern edges of Damascus. The Failaq al-Rahman opposition faction says it is not party to the agreement, and the government says it is fighting terrorists.
The government has leaned on its air force and its ground-to-ground missile systems to push rebels out and away from the capital. Several neighborhoods and towns have been destroyed. The opposition does not have an air force.

ROCHESTER, N.Y. (WROC-TV) - Rochester Mayor Lovely Warren's re-election campaign apologized Tuesday night for what they are calling an error in their campaign paperwork submitted earlier this month.
According to the expenditures of Warren's political action committee, Warren for a Stronger Rochester PAC, $30,000 was transferred from the PAC to her committee, Friends of Lovely Warren.
New York State has strict rules forbidding PACs and committees from coordinating.
Warren's campaign claims the money was earmarked for Friends of Lovely Warren, but was accidentally placed in the PAC account through a “PayPal error.”
Tuesday night, the campaign released the names of the donors that together handed over that pot of money.
The campaign also said that pot actually totaled only $25,000 and will, therefore, reimburse the PAC $5,000.
In addition, the campaign emphasized “the PAC and Friends account are completely separate” and apologized “for any confusion and all reports will be amended forthright to reflect these changes.”
Other PAC activity like its possible involvement in the Mayor's Ball have prompted one of Warren's Democratic opponents James Sheppard to file a complaint with the New York State Board of Elections' Division of Election Enforcement claiming her PAC and committee “maintain common operational control with the same individuals exercising actual and strategic control over the day-to-day activities of both organizations.”
Susan Lerner of Common Cause NY also expressed concern.
“This is very problematic,” Lerner said. “New York law has the most expansive definition of coordination between the candidates and an independent expenditure committee and therefore I think it's very important there be a very detailed look into how the Warren PAC is behaving.”
Through the recent filings, News 8 also learned the campaign committees for both Warren and Sheppard have raised well over $200,000 each since the start of the year.
Friends of Lovely Warren took in $241,275 between its January report and July's, while Sheppard collected $223,082.
Spending for each committee jumped the $100,000 mark with Warren's expenditures at $167,298 and Sheppard's reaching $122,921.
Another Democrat in the race, Rachel Barnhart has raised almost $31,000 and has spent nearly $9,000.
The primary for Rochester mayor will take place on September 12.
Cost of your health plan to rise 14%
High-deductable plans offer the lowest upfront costs, but you'll have to shoulder more of the burden for care if you get sick.
(MONEY Magazine) -- It's that time of year when employers deliver bad news about next year's benefits.
Chances are you'll learn that your 2011 health insurance tab will be sharply higher, as companies continue to shift the burden of rising costs onto their workers.
Employees' share of premiums for a family plan is up an average 14%, to $3,997, vs. just a 3% rise in the total bill, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation.
And it's not just premiums that are spiraling higher. You're also likely to be hit with higher deductibles and out-of-pocket maximums as well as bigger bills for doctor's visits and drugs.
"Increasingly, employees have to be thoughtful about not just the cost of the plan, but the cost of the services they use," says Michael Thompson, a principal with Pricewaterhouse-Coopers' human resources practice.
It seems people are doing that, but not in the way experts recommend: Recent data suggest that many insured Americans are now forgoing care because of the cost. Rather than sacrificing your health, keep expenses in check with these strategies.
Pick the right plan
About half of workers will have more than one plan to choose from during open enrollment, Kaiser reports. Premiums for PPO and HMO options probably won't differ by a lot. But deductibles and coverage amounts will vary widely, even among same-type plans, making comparison difficult.
Your employer may provide projections of your costs in each option, or tools to help you figure this out. But if not, start by adding the premium and deductible for each.
Weed out plans that don't include your favorite doctors in network. Then, under the remaining choices, estimate how much you might pay for care you use regularly. With co-insurance (you pay a percentage) increasingly replacing co-pays (you pay a flat fee), you may need to call your providers to find out their full rate.
Nearly 80% of workers will have plans with at least three cost tiers for prescriptions, Kaiser reports, so also see how the drugs you take will be covered.
Finally, eyeball each plan's out-of-pocket maximum, the most you'll pay if you get sick -- and know what counts toward it.
If you're healthy and can bank enough to cover possible costs, you may score serious savings by picking a high-deductible health plan combined with a health savings account, a pairing offered by a rising number of employers.
Such plans usually have the lowest premiums, and you can stash up to $6,150 tax-free for medical expenses, money that rolls over if you don't use it. But they aren't for everyone: If you have recurring expenses, such as maintenance drugs, you may not be a good candidate, says Gary Claxton, a VP at Kaiser.
Say yes to cost savers
A small but growing number of large companies are offering modest reductions on premiums or deductibles to employees who fill out health-risk assessments or keep chronic conditions in check. Don't miss out on any breaks for healthy behavior.
Also, if your employer offers a flexible spending account -- 85% of big companies do, reports HR consulting firm Mercer -- sign up. You can stash pretax cash for health costs. And in the 28% tax bracket, a $1,500 contribution can save you upwards of $500 (including payroll taxes).
Since you'll forfeit funds unused by year's end, look back on 2010 spending to decide how much to save. One key change: Starting in 2011, you can no longer use your FSA for over-the-counter drugs unless you have a prescription.
Negotiate with your docs
With co-insurance growing more common, and co-pays and deductibles going up, you may be surprised at how much more you'll pay for care.
Make money part of the conversation with your providers. Ask your doctor or his billing manager what the charges will be upfront. And if you're below the deductible, say so; you may get a deal.
Also, offer to pay at the time of your visit -- many providers will give a discount of 20% to 40%, says Mark Rukavina, of Access Project, a nonprofit that helps consumers negotiate medical debt. "They're trying to avoid collection costs and receivables on their books."
Stretch your drug benefit
For plans with prescription tiers, the average co-pay for generic meds is $11, while preferred brand names cost $28, and nonpreferred drugs will run $49 and $89, depending on how they're categorized, Kaiser reports.
Going generic is the best way to keep costs down. But if there's no off-brand version of your drug, bring the plan formulary -- a list of how meds are covered -- to your doctor to see if there's a preferred drug that's a good substitute.
If your plan offers a mail-order option, you could save up to a third by using it to get a 90-day prescription filled, says Thompson. You might also ask your doc if it's possible for him to write the Rx for twice the dosage, and for you to halve the pills. The price will be easier to swallow.
Although past-year exposure rates to psychological, physical and sexual IPV were similar among women and men, earlier-in-life exposure to all three forms of violence was significantly higher among women. Psychological, physical and sexual IPV often co-occurred. Factors associated with all forms of IPV for both women and men were poor/moderate social support, having grown up in a home with violence and being single, divorced or widowed. There was a tendency for women and men to report different social consequences of IPV; however, these differences were not statistically significant.
Sweden is often considered to be one of the most gender equal countries worldwide with its high participation of both women and men in, for example, the labour force; decision-making posts, such as the Parliament; and higher education. There is generally a low tolerance of violence and using violence in an intimate relationship is punishable by law. There exist few studies that assess IPV in the general population of both women and men; the present findings confirm that IPV is common in Sweden and that continued efforts towards ending IPV are warranted. Professionals working within the health care sector should be sensitive towards the possibility that a male or female patient may have been exposed to violence in their intimate relationship and that this violence may take place in many different contexts and lead to a diverse set of consequences. Health professionals are in a unique and valuable position to detect and document IPV.
Prevalence, frequency and co-occurrence of psychological, physical and sexual IPV Previous studies have also found that past-year IPV estimates are similar in women and men, but that earlier-in-life IPV is higher in women [6, 34, 35]. It may be hypothesized that the two different time frames in part reflect differences in severity and impact of IPV between women and men, which have been found by previous studies [13, 22]. For example, considering that men generally experience less threatening and severe forms of IPV, they may not consider it particularly salient to remember later in life. Similarly, given that women are generally exposed to more severe forms of IPV with higher levels of physical injury, coercive control and fear, they may be more likely to report such violence also later in life [36]. Given that several studies rely on past-year estimates–which, for example, have been considered to be the norm in community-based samples [37]–this finding suggests that gender differences in exposure to IPV might go unnoticed if earlier-in-life estimates are not accounted for. Our past-year exposure rates are similar to those reported in previous studies, with the exception of sexual IPV, which is usually found to be more prevalent among women than men [34, 38]. The earlier-in-life rates were somewhat lower in the current study compared to previous ones, [34, 39] which may be due to actual differences in prevalence and to differences in the definitions of IPV. In line with previous population-based studies, [40] severe acts of IPV were more seldom reported and our sample consisted mostly of the comparatively less severe acts of IPV. The finding that women were exposed to all three forms of IPV more often than men within the earlier-in-life time frame (22.1% vs. 11.5%) is supported by other studies [24]. However, corresponding rates during the past year were similar between women and men (4.5% vs. 3.9%). This further highlights the importance of considering the earlier-in-life time frame when assessing gender differences in exposure to IPV. Our exposure rates for psychological violence are higher than the other forms of IPV, which is in line with previous studies [4, 24]. Finally, it is worth noting that while support has been found for the VAWI's validity among the female sample used in the current study, [29] the VAWI's conceptual model was only partially replicated among the male sample [28]. Instead, the boundaries between psychological, physical and sexual acts of violence were indistinct. Although further studies are needed in order to understand these results more fully, it nevertheless introduces a degree of uncertainty to our direct comparisons between women's and men's responses. Even if similar acts of violence are reported, the underlying constructs may differ. However, support for the instrument's reliability was found among both samples.
Associated socio-demographic and psychosocial factors We found that both poor to moderate social support, having grown up in a home with violence and being single, widowed or divorced increased the likelihood of reporting exposure to psychological and physical/sexual IPV for both women and men residing in Sweden, which is in line with previous literature from other countries [24, 41]. A possible explanation for the association between IPV and being single, widowed or divorced may be that the IPV was committed by a previous partner, which may be easier to report than violence experienced by a current partner. Although most population-based studies investigate associated factors with physical and/or sexual IPV, our findings suggest that such factors are also associated with exposure to psychological IPV. Educational level was also found to be associated with IPV, specifically having a university degree and/or having completed high school increased the likelihood for reporting psychological IPV for both men and women. Another population-based study assessing violence against men by several perpetrators and which was also conducted in Sweden has reported similar findings; [42] however, additional studies are needed to investigate this association further.
Social consequences of violence to everyday life, own use of violence and reasons for using such violence Social consequences Researchers have long underlined the importance of assessing consequences of IPV alongside the violent acts themselves as a way to consider the impact of IPV on women's and men's lives [35]. In the current study, a traditional gender structure emerged to some extent from the results: only women reported consequences which related to children, whereas men more often reported consequences related to work. As more women than men reacted by divorcing their spouse or moving away from home to protect themselves from IPV, a possible interpretation is that women felt more threatened by the violence and therefore took more measures to end the relationship than men. This finding is supported by a study where women were more likely to dissolve a heterosexual relationship than men if there occurred severe forms of violence, whereas women and men were equally likely to dissolve a relationship if there occurred less severe forms of IPV [43]. Own use of violence Although only 4.0% women and 4.3% men in the total population sample reported having used IPV sometime in their lives when assessed by a single item, a larger number of the respondents (9.6% women and 8.0% men of the total sample), however, gave a reason for having used IPV. This discrepancy may not be surprising as respondents may find it easier to give reasons for using violence than to define their use of violence as IPV, which has indeed been found to under-estimate true prevalence rates [44]. Both women and men under-report their use of IPV although some studies have found women to under-report to a lesser extent than men [18]. Reasons for this may be that women are more prone to remember their use of violence as they are transgressing a gender norm in using violence, whereas the use of violence is a more acceptable part of masculinity constructions and therefore may go more unnoticed or become normalized [11]. Our finding that some report own use of violence may suggest that IPV takes place in several contexts, including relationships where the respondent is both exposed to and exposes his/her partner to violence, as shown by previous studies [19, 45]. Reasons given for using violence Reasons given for perpetrating violent acts may also reflect on the context in which the IPV took place [35]. The most commonly self-reported reason for using IPV by both the women and men was having felt offended and/or hurt, which has also been reported in the literature [45]. The second most reported reason by women was feeling afraid and using violence in self-defence in a violent situation. Previous studies have often found women to use IPV in self-defence [46]. The second most reported reason by men for having used violence was in a quarrel in which alcohol or illicit drugs was involved.
The Family Research Council is not happy about the decision by the U.S. embassy in Tel Aviv to fly the LGBT pride flag this month.
Yesterday on his radio program, “Washington Watch,” FRC president Tony Perkins denounced the embassy's decision.
“The rainbow flag over Israel — the last time they were flying that over Sodom and Gomorrah it didn't work out so well,” Perkins said. “This administration is not just ignoring or indifferent to traditional values, it is hostile to them, it is hostile to the very things that made America great.”
Perkinbs also spoke to a caller who said President Obama is “Satan personified” and a “terrorist” who “threatened” House Speaker John Boehner “and his family” to keep him in check.
Perkins kept the allegation alive, telling the caller that “there could be something to that, I don't know, I don't think it's come to that” while noting that “this president and his policies” have “dismantled the country morally and culturally.”
Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer Charles (Chuck) Ellis SchumerBrennan fires back at 'selfish' Trump over Harry Reid criticism Trump rips Harry Reid for 'failed career' after ex-Dem leader slams him in interview Harry Reid: 'I don't see anything' Trump is doing right MORE (D-N.Y.) said Thursday that the deputy attorney general has been asked to brief the entire Senate next week in the wake of FBI Director James Comey's firing.
"I've just heard from the majority leader that he will invite Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein to an all senators briefing next week. ... It is a good first step, and I thank the majority leader for consenting to this request," Schumer said from the Senate floor.
"So the leader is working on scheduling a briefing for all members from Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein. Once we have more information we'll be sure to make an announcement," he said in response to a question about Schumer's comments.

Schumer noted that Rosenstein offered to meet with him while he was on Capitol Hill on Thursday, but Schumer stressed that the No. 2 Justice Department official needed to meet with all senators.
"I said I wanted to meet with him along with my 99 colleagues so that members of both parties were given the opportunity to question him," he said.
Schumer said while Rosenstein hasn't formally accepted the invitation, he believes it is "very likely" that the briefing will happen.
He added that "I am glad he has a willingness to come talk to Congress, and I hope he'll accept our bipartisan investigation."
Schumer reiterated early Thursday evening that Democrats still want Sessions to come speak with them. Democrats have homed in on Sessions since Comey's firing, questioning his involvement with the decision because he previously recused himself from any involvement in investigations tied to Russia's role in the 2016 campaign.
"Attorney General Sessions must be made available to the Senate in a similar capacity given his reported role in firing Director Comey and helping select his replacement, considering his recusal from the Russia investigation, his close involvement in these events warrants the Senate's questioning as well," he said.
On Saturday 21st May 2016, Eve Valkyrie played host to the third round of the Battle of the Devs. During this event some of the games developers join the pilots in the regular map rotation, un-squadded, to either aid or destroy the other players.
There was a great showing of both developers and players on the EU and US servers. The participating developers included: [CCP] – Roo, Starbug, Blowout, Restart, Redcape, Jbot, Groot, Skrekkur and Sine (As XCP-Sine)
The devs hopped on the EU servers at 3pm UTC for 17 Rounds in total – you can find rounds 3 – 17 here:
At 6pm UTC they then swapped over to the US servers. We followed them over for one game to see if the server filled and sure enough, it was; so we thought it would be best to leave the US guys to play with the devs instead.
I hopped on again with a friend at 9PM UTC and it appeared that there were three games going simultaneously filled with players and devs. We got on the last server where there were two devs left against almost full teams of bots, so we played another 4-5 games, however I didn't stream or record these fights.
I've created a highlights reel of the night's dev kills, deaths, assists and saves during the night from my POV for a few laughs:
I think XCP_Sine and CCP Starbug were the ones that killed me the most, CCP Roo and CCP Jbot were the ones I killed the most and CCP Redcape and CCP Roo were the ones I repaired/saved the most!
All in all, it was a great laugh, was good to see so many players joining in too.
Hopefully there will be another one soon!
Conception Bay South rugby star Ciaran Hearn has landed a contract with the London Irish rugby team in the U.K, shortly after playing on team Canada in the Rugby World Cup last month.
"It means a lot, it's not everyday you get to play against the best players in the world," said the 30-year-old from his training base in Victoria, B.C.
Hearn went on vacation in France after the World Cup, amid rumours that the club was impressed by his talent at the tournament.
London Irish has signed Canadian international Ciaran Hearn for the remainder of the season. <a href="https://t.co/WiWdTn3hG6">https://t.co/WiWdTn3hG6</a> <a href="https://t.co/0PgHndynAK">pic.twitter.com/0PgHndynAK</a> —@LiRFC
"I've been around long enough to know talking is just talking, unless you have a written deal in front of your face, it means nothing," said Hearn.
But days within being back in Canada, that paperwork arrived, much to his surprise.
"It was kind of nice to see that they wanted me enough to get it rushed," he said.
Hearn grew up playing with the Newfoundland and Labrador Rugby Union, and was selected for the Own the Podium training program ahead of the 2016 Summer Olympics in Brazil.
An English welcome
In a statement, the head of rugby operations for the London Irish, Glenn Delaney, said Hearn was outstanding in the World Cup.
"His level of physicality and ability to distribute and contribute to an all-round game has been very impressive," said Delaney.
"It is a great opportunity for him to come and experience what it is like to play in probably the toughest domestic league in the world."
Hearn will be heading to England as soon as his visas are straightened out, and he can't wait for the challenge.
"It's huge," said Hearn. "I haven't cracked the lineup yet, so that's gonna be the next battle, is trying to crack the 23-man squad."
Hearn has a contract to play with the club, based southeast of London in Sunbury-on-Thames, until May.
"If they like you, I get a chance to re-sign in March."
IN an incident that has left Gokwe villagers' tongues wagging, a 53-year-old woman was found with a male sexual organ which she was using as a charm to centrally lock her polygamous husband from having sex with his younger wife.
There was drama at Chief Nemangwe's traditional court when the woman, Cecilia Mbano was allegedly found with a male sexual organ which she claimed she was using to lock her husband so that his manhood would not erect each time he attempted to have sex with his younger wife, Chipo Moyo.
It is understood that Mbano allegedly forced Moyo to marry her husband Albert Taurwa in an attempt to stop him from marrying her younger sister after he proposed love to her and approached their parents intending to pay the bride price. Mbano then approached Moyo so that she could be her husband's second wife as she could not stomach sharing a husband with her sibling.
Narrating her ordeal to Chief Nemangwe, Moyo said she started having problems with her husband Taurwa when he started denying her conjugal rights and he went on to urinate on her private parts as punishment for demanding sex from him.
“I then approached my parents after my husband urinated on my private parts as a way of punishing me for asking him to have sex with him. I then approached a traditional healer for assistance because each time we attempted to have sex his manhood would become powerless,” she said.
It was during the cleansing ceremony that a tsikamutanda (witch-hunter) discovered a male sexual organ tied with a red string in Mbano's bedroom hut. Mbano allegedly confessed to using the male sexual organ for centrally locking her husband so that he would not have sex with the second wife. She also claimed that she got the juju from a self-proclaimed traditional healer from Simuchembo area in Gokwe, identified as Sekuru Mapitipiti.
Mbano left villagers at Chief Nemangwe's traditional court tongue-tied when she produced the male genitalia as evidence. Chief Nemangwe confirmed that the matter was heard before his court.
“I can confirm that I heard that matter in my court. I have summoned Sekuru Mapitipiti to appear in my court on Sunday (today),” he said. sunday news

(Photo: Atomic Taco)Last week, the United States Post Office announced it is ending Saturday delivery of mail in an effort to save $2 billion a year.
Since then, our news media has completely botched the story, and given cover to a Republican Party and its corporate donors. For years they've been trying to destroy the United States Post Office – the largest employer of unionized workers in the nation – and now they're making it happen. But almost nobody is reporting on that aspect of it.
One of the most egregious examples of this media malpractice occurred on Sunday's Meet the Press, when David Gregory reported on the Post Office's cutbacks by saying, “In the information age…what we affectionately call ‘snail mail' seems somewhat impractical.”
He noted that there were “45 Billion fewer pieces of mail today than just five years ago,” and that the Post Office had a “$16 billion shortfall in 2012.”
“So the bigger question,” Gregory asks, “is this: Is the current model sustainable?”
Not once in the report, did David Gregory bring up the real reason why the Post Office is hemorrhaging cash and now taking drastic measures to find savings. The Post Office was described as just the latest victim of the digital age, rather than what it really is: the latest victim of the Conservative war on unions.
Rewind back to 2006.
Things were going well for the Post Office. They were making money. They were even seriously considering replacing a large part of their fleet – the largest fleet of vehicles in the nation – with electric vehicles. It would be a huge boost for the electric car, and a huge slap in the face of oil barons like the Koch Brothers.
The Post Office had to be stopped, and Republican Congressman John McHugh (NY) was the man to do it. He had been a member of the Koch-funded American Legislative Exchange Council or ALEC, and was deeply in the pocket of right-wing interests. In 2006, he succeeded in proposing and then watching pass the Postal Accountability and Enhancement Act. It was passed by a voice vote in a Republican Congress and signed by Republican President George W. Bush.
What the law did was ram a poison pill down the throat of the Post Office. It required the USPS to pre-funding its Retiree Health Benefits Fund for more than seven decades out into the future – and do it all within ten years. With this law, Congress forced the Post Office to set aside money for the health benefits of future retirees who aren't even born yet.
It's an obligation that no other private business or government agency has ever had to comply with before. And it costs the Post Office $5 billion a year.
So the news media thinks ending Saturday delivery to save $2 billion a year is worth reporting on. But a Congressional requirement that sucks $5 billion out of the Post Office annually doesn't even receive a mention.
The Post Office was regularly running surpluses prior to this poison pill legislation. But every year since, the Post Office has lost more and more money to that retirement fund for people 75 years from now. So they're now ending Saturday delivery, looking to close offices around the nation, and will likely lay off tens of thousands of unionized workers.
Of course, the big winners in all of this are private mail carriers like FedEx and UPS that eventually won't have to compete with the Post Office and its ability to send a letter from Florida to Alaska for less than 50-cents. Or its ability to offer Saturday service at no extra cost. Private mail carriers charge between 50x and 100x more than the USPS when it comes to paper mail delivery.
The passage of the Postal Accountability and Enhancement Act in 2006 was the culmination of a relentless effort carried out by Conservative Koch-funded think tanks like the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC), CATO, and the National Taxpayers Union, that had spent years writing papers and lobbying Congress to privatize the Post Office.
A common misconception is that the Post Office is a government agency funded by taxpayer dollars. That's not true. In fact, the Post Office has largely been self-sufficient since the 1980's and only recently has been forced to appeal to Congress for help since it swallowed that Republican poison pill in 2006. But the Post Office does have to fulfill a requirement by the government to provide universal service. It also was given a monopoly over most paper mail delivery.
Conservatives hate this. Government getting something right? For over 240 years? Unthinkable! Call in the CEOs!
So, we the consumers will get screwed when the price of mail will rise dramatically without the Post Office. But, hey, it will make a bunch of stockholders and CEOs at for-profit corporations like FedEx and UPS really, really rich.
And perhaps most importantly, by breaking up the Post Office and its half-million unionized workers – Conservatives have once again neutered organized labor in America and starved the Democratic Party of a primary fundraising base.
Curiously, ALEC, which writes corporate friendly legislation and relies on its membership of Republican lawmakers around the nation to pass this legislation, had a model bill known as the “Unfunded Pensions Liabilities Act,” which calls on state governments to account for exactly how they plan to fund future retiree benefits.
The law passed by Republicans in 2006 that's crippled the Post Office today uses this same principle, and then takes it a step further to require the post office to pre-fund those retiree benefits 75 years out into the future.
Congressman John McHugh who was the main primarily responsible for the 2006 law is a former member of ALEC. So, too, was former Virginia Representative Tom Davis. And he co-sponsored the law, too.
In the years since the Post Office was forced to set aside more than $5 billion a year, private carriers like UPS and FedEx have seen their revenues and stocks increase dramatically. As billions are siphoned out of the Post Office every year, it can no longer reinvest in updating equipment, and thus finds it harder and harder compete with the private market.
In the first two years since the 2006 law kicked in, investors in FedEx enjoyed a 25% increase in the value of their company.
So this plan to kill the Post Office has, so far, been executed flawlessly by the Republican Party and its corporate overlords.
But even they couldn't have expected all the help they've received in the years since from a mainstream corporate media that fails over and over again to report on what's really happening with the Post Office.
Whether it's lazy journalism or an effort to give cover to the corporatists, the news media is assisting in the demise of the Post Office – an institution started by Ben Franklin that's older than the United States itself.
So that leaves it up to us – “we the people” – to tell the real story about what's happening. The Digital Age isn't killing the Post Office. Instead, the demise of the Post Office is another good ol' fashioned story of corporate corruption of politicians and a Republican Party that exists, first and foremost, to serve the CEO class and screw the middle class.
On Monday, Sen. John McCain (R-AZ) slammed a Newsweek article published by Howard Kurtz in the Daily Beast for factual errors and liberal bias. He said that Kurtz's piece, and the allegations contained within, are “foolishness” and “left-wing trash.”
RELATED: Mitt Romney Responds To Newsweek Cover Story Calling Him A ‘Wimp'
In a piece on McCain, Kurtz claimed that Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney and McCain's relationship still suffers from a rift incurred during the tough presidential primary fight in 2008.
As for McCain's relationship with Romney, it seems to have improved—-somewhat—since 2008. The wounds sustained during their primary battle had been unusually deep and personal: When Romney charged him with promoting amnesty for illegal immigrants, McCain accused his rival of “desperate, flailing, and false attacks.” And at one point, Romney ripped McCain for “Nixon-era” tactics. But once the battle ended, says McCain, “nobody helped me more than Mitt Romney.” The vanquished candidate visited McCain's retreat in Sedona “and we became friends. I wouldn't say close friends. Why look back in anger? It's not healthy for you mentally.”
McCain said that the allegation that there were ever “deep and personal” wounds between Romney and the former GOP presidential nominee was baseless.
“It's just foolishness,” said McCain. “It's just the kind of liberal left-wing trash that I have to put up with from time-to-time.”
McCain said the article contained a factually incorrect assertion that after losing the 2008 election he took a vacation in Tahiti.
“I didn't,” said McCain. “The most amateur fact-checker would have known that. I went after 2000. That shows you the kind of slip-job work that went to the story, I'm reluctant to even comment on something like that.”
According to POLITICO's Dylan Beyers and Manu Raju, Kurtz has acknowledged the Tahiti error but says he never questioned McCain's support for Romney.
“The Newsweek piece makes clear that Senator McCain is enthusiastically supporting Mitt Romney,” Kurtz told POLITICO . “To the extent the Romney camp is not (with some exceptions) taking McCain's advice or giving him a prominent campaign role comes in part from three interviews with the senator himself. Nothing “liberal” or “left wing” about that. I appreciate Senator McCain being generous with his time and regret the mix-up about the date of his vacation.”

New Boston, N.H. – After she was fired for exposing the predatory behavior of one of her superior officers, a female cop has gone public with her case and filed a lawsuit against her former employer. According to the former officer, Alexandra Drake, her supervisor, Michael Masella, a lieutenant with the New Boston Police Department, was sexually threatening multiple female officers and would brag about he preyed on women at traffic stops.
Drake blew the whistle about her superior's behavior and filed a report along with another employee who witnessed his behavior. However, instead of looking into the allegations, the department fired Drake and accused her of lying.
According to a recent lawsuit, Drake noticed Masella's disturbing behavior while she was training under him at the New Boston Police department. The department alleges that she was fired for incorrectly filling out a police report, but she says she filed the report exactly as she was ordered to, by her superior, Masella.
According to the lawsuit, “After completing the stop, he told Drake that he wanted to just take them out and ‘rape' them rather than issue a citation. Masella would routinely make comments about female drivers whom he thought found him attractive or good looking. He has apparently developed a ‘rapability' scale about female drivers and would test Drake whether a particular driver was ‘rapable.' ”
“Masella spoke very negatively about the two former female employees, which made Drake nervous. Drake was certain that the slightest slip could make her a target of severe harassment, termination of employment or even rape,” it continued.
Drake says that Smith made inappropriate advances towards her on several occasions while they were on and off-duty.
“Masella arrived in a cruiser while he was on duty wearing a full police uniform. When Drake opened the front door, Masella asked her if she was naked. Drake told Masella she ‘was not' at which point Masella stated ‘Oh, alright I will come back later.' ” the lawsuit stated.
County attorney Donald Smith denied commenting on behalf of the police department, telling NECN that, “As a policy, the Town of New Boston does not comment on pending litigation. The Town is in the process of preparing a response to the allegations brought forth by Ms. Drake.”
In the statement to the press, Smith denied the charges.
“The complaint contains inaccurate information which will be addressed as part of the ongoing legal process,” Smith said.
When Drake made a complaint to the police chief about the issue, she was the one who was interrogated instead of Masella, and she was fired shortly after.
“During this interrogation of Drake, she was subjected to a barrage of questioning lasting for over an hour while the offending supervisor, Masella stood close by,” the lawsuit stated.
To add insult to injury Drake was issued a warning for violating the county's sexual harassment policy with her termination.
Unfortunately, this type of response to good cops, who try to call out corruption in their department is the rule, not the exception.
Previously, the Free Thought Project brought you the story of Laura Schook, who tried to call out corruption in her department. Naturally, they tried to run her through the mud and fire her.
Prior to Schook, we broke the story of a cop in Buffalo, NY who was beaten and fired after she stopped a fellow cop from nearly killing a handcuffed man. She is still fighting for her pension.
In Kentucky, a sheriff's deputy was fired for “insubordination” after pointing out that the sheriff had planted drugs in another deputy's car. Even though the sheriff was indicted, the deputy was still fired.
In September of 2014, we exposed the Baltimore police department's attempt to intimidate a whistleblower officer. Detective Joe Crystal became a target of intimidation for his entire department after testifying against other officers in a misconduct case. Following his testimony, he received threats from other officers and even found dead rats on he and his wife's cars.
The thin blue line, it seems, is akin to the mafia — cross it and you will be snubbed out by the rest of the gang.
NFL What's Wrong With Marcus Mariota? By
Marcus Mariota came into 2017 as one of, if not the most, promising quarterback prospects in the entire NFL. Coming off a second season that saw him improve across the board from his rookie totals, Mariota has completely fallen apart through 14 weeks this season. With a career-high 14 interceptions to go with just ten touchdown passes, it's clear something isn't quite right with the Titans and Mariota — but what exactly is causing such a dynamic talent to play so poorly?
It all starts with the coaching staff and offensive game plans the Titans have put together this season. With DeMarco Murray not playing nearly as well as he did last season, the entire offense has faltered, and the Titans coaching staff has failed to make the proper adjustments.
Mariota is at his best when throwing off play action, unfortunately, the opposing defense needs to be scared of the running game for the play action to work, and Murray isn't scaring anybody right now. A solution does exist, however, in the form of second-year man Derrick Henry. Henry has been explosive in his limited touches this season, displaying the power, speed, and vision of a top running back. If head coach Mike Mularkey wants to get his offense back on track, the first step is to hand the reins of the rushing attack to Henry.
With that said, Mariota's struggles aren't entirely on the coaching staff. Too often this season Mariota has panicked when the pocket begins to break down, and as a result, he has developed a habit of not setting his feet when he throws, leading to inaccurate passes. This is a correctable issue, but with the Titans looking to make a playoff push, there's very little time to spend breaking his new habits.
Perhaps the most troubling part of the season for Mariota is his win-loss splits. In wins, he has thrown for nine touchdowns and six interceptions; not great numbers, but not terrible either. In losses, however, Mariota has thrown just one touchdown pass against eight interceptions. This goes to show that when the Titans struggle as a team, Mariota has been unable to offer the same spark we saw last season.
It's obvious that Marcus Mariota is struggling in his third season, and though there are plenty of factors contributing to his down year, the fact is, he needs to play better if the Titans hope to do anything noteworthy. This is still one of the league's bright young stars, but until the Titans make the adjustments necessary to their offense and Mariota breaks the bad habits he has developed, this team will ultimately fall short.

QPR substitute Bobby Zamora struck a dramatic 90th-minute winner as 10-men Rangers made an immediate return to the Premier League by defeating Derby in an absorbing play-off final at Wembley.
The London side had been hanging on - with goalkeeper Robert Green making a series of good saves - before Zamora pounced on an error from Derby defender Richard Keogh to score just his fourth goal of the season with Rangers' only shot on target.
Harry Redknapp's side had been reduced to 10 men just before the hour when Gary O'Neil was red carded for a late challenge on Johnny Russell, who was closing down on goal.
Bobby on the spot for Rangers Bobby Zamora's goal came with QPR's first and only shot on target in the match. The 33-year-old's last three goals for the club have arrived in the 90th minute or later
Derby were already in the ascendancy by then and looked likely to go on and win the contest after assuming a numerical advantage. But Rangers defended with courage and organisation and struck decisively through Zamora, as boss Redknapp ended his first play-off campaign with promotion.
QPR had laboured through periods of the Championship season and won just four of their previous 10 games coming into the Wembley final.
But they can now start planning for a return to the top flight, with the club set to benefit by £80m according to one estimate from Sport Business Group Deloitte.
However, it may not all be plain sailing for Rangers, who made a £65.4m loss during the 2012-13 season and could yet face a huge fine at the end of the year under the Football League's financial fair play regulations if they suffer another heavy loss for the campaign just finished.
None of this will matter to luckless Derby, who were the better side for large periods.
They have played with spirit, skill and freedom under manager Steve McClaren, who took over in September with the club 14th in the Championship table.
But the young Rams side will have to wait for at least another year if they are to return to the Premier League for the first time since their relegation in 2008.
Been there before? 4,264 - The total amount of appearances in the Premier League made by the 27 QPR players who have previously played in the top flight
QPR, rich in age and experience, initially looked the most accomplished but they created few clear openings - top scorer Charlie Austin shot over from distance and Joey Barton smashed a free-kick into the wall - and lost Niko Kranjcar to injury by break.
Derby lined up 4-3-3 with Will Hughes retaining his place in midfield despite the return to fitness of Craig Bryson as both teams were unchanged from their semi-final second-leg fixtures.
At first, the Rams looked like a young team suffering stage fright before slowly starting to impose themselves on the contest.
Craig Forsyth headed wide and the increasingly influential Hughes thought he had been caught inside the area by Richard Dunne after pulling off a Cruyff turn but his protests were ignored by referee Lee Mason.

The nearest the game came to a goal before the end of a poor opening half was through a Jamie Ward free-kick that everybody missed except for Hoops keeper Green, who made a good scrambling save.
Austin shot wide after the restart but, that aside, Derby were clearly on top and the odds moved further in their favour when O'Neil was dismissed for his challenge on Russell just short of the penalty area. Rangers lost possession in midfield and O'Neil unquestionably snuffed out a goalscoring opportunity.
By now the momentum was firmly in Derby's favour and Green made a trio of saves to deny substitutes Craig Bryson and Simon Dawkins as well as Chris Martin.
It was one team holding on, another punching holes in the opposition defence and looking to strike a decisive blow but, after Derby failed to clear a throw-in and the soon-to-be inconsolable Rams captain Keogh scuffed his clearance, Zamora buried his effort from 10 yards as Rangers snatched victory.
You can listen to commentary of Bobby Zamora's winner on the BBC Radio 5 live website.
After this weekend's tragic events in Charlottesville, VA, you'd think Americans would think twice before staging more hate-filled protests that too often lead to violence. Yet, the scene at New York City's Trump Tower Tuesday night was just as shameful as ever. Six months into President Trump's legitimate presidency, and he is still being greeted like this.
Presumably, these protesters are lashing out at the president for his first response to the Charlottesville tragedy. In his initial statement, Trump did not condemn white supremacy specifically. After backlash, he made himself much clearer in a statement directly from the White House, denouncing the KKK and white nationalism. Yet, judging by the scene in New York Monday night, his words do not appear to not have appeased his critics.
Trump wasn't the only target last night. His supporters, including the men in this video who were holding a “Thank God for Trump” sign, were attacked with expletives. Apologies for the language, but just listen to the hate coming from this woman's voice.
Leftists lose their minds over a "Thank God for Trump" sign. #TrumpTower pic.twitter.com/wbhg0087dM — Based Monitored ???? (@BasedMonitored) August 15, 2017
The police, who were only trying to protect the protesters, were also not safe from the hate. One young woman was so incensed she called the officers Nazis. Check out this video from observers on the ground. (Again, language warning.)
JUST NOW: Anti-Trump protestor screams, curses at the NYPD for protecting Trump Tower! What a disgrace! pic.twitter.com/CRmAC2P5x5 — Newt-Trump Fan Club (@NewtTrump) August 14, 2017
Some social media users noted that these kinds of demonstrations will only fuel Trump to a second term. This madness does nothing for the progressive cause.
Police shouldn't have to spend their precious time monitoring protests every single day and night. Why don't we let them and the president do their jobs?
Trump appears to be doing just that. He tweeted that he is back in New York City for meetings on military purchases and trade.
Here at CES, Misfit has significantly upped their activity tracker game by diving into the GPS watch realm. The company, known for their lightweight and fashionable wearables, announced a new $200 GPS sport watch set to release later this year.
I got a bit of hands-on time earlier this week, getting the chance to poke at the watch and see where it stands – so let's dive right into it. Just to be super-clear though first, this isn't a review. Nor anything like it. It's just an early and brief look at the unit in very beta form.
The Tech Details:
The first thing you'll notice about the Vapor is the stunning display on it. It has the visual appeal and color vividness that you see on an Apple Watch. It really is impressive.
The 1.4” AMOLED touchscreen displays apps within the watch, which are arranged on a rotating menu along the top. The watch, which is based on Android (but not Android Wear), doesn't support 3rd party apps within the menu at this time. Misfit says they're focused on the core watch experience for now, inclusive of fitness and non-fitness apps.
For example, the unit has a workout app (i.e. for running), as well as apps for music, contacts, calendar, messages, and weather. The running app, like a number of apps, wasn't complete/functional yet on the unit I tried. So there wasn't any method to dive into the GPS any deeper.
In the case of music, the unit has 4GB of internal storage, of which about 2GB is usable for music (roughly a few hundred songs). Vapor doesn't contain a speaker, but instead connects to Bluetooth devices such as headphones or speakers. They were able to demo this part to a nearby portable Bluetooth speaker and it worked pretty well.
The watch has a microphone on the side, enabling you to take voice notes. You can't however use it for completing calls (à la Apple Watch). Like other activity trackers, you'll receive smartphone notifications – though it's just for reading. There won't be a method to respond natively on the watch to them.
Of course, with such a stunning display you're going to take a solid whack on battery life. The watch comes in at 2 days of battery life, which is basically in the same ballpark in real-world usage as many Android Wear watches, or the Apple Watch Series 2 units (+/- 8 hours). With Vapor, the company is aiming for 5 hours of GPS-on time. Their goal there was to allow a user to complete a marathon, and 5 hours will cover most folks.
You may remember Misfit's integration and partnerships with Speedo on some of their past devices, both in terms of software and branded models. Whether that integration will occur for Vapor hasn't yet been decided upon by either company. Though it sounds like one way or another Misfit will ensure indoor swim support is covered within the software functionality, similar to how it was previous to Speedo's involvement.
Wrapping up the sports piece, the Vapor does include an optical HR sensor on the back which will primarily be used for sports/workouts. The degree to which it might be used for 24×7 mode is up in the air still.
At the planned $200 price point, it would be one of the lowest priced mainstream options inclusive of music, GPS, and optical HR. Right now that feature-set puts you in the $250-$300 range for brands like TomTom (Spark 3) and Polar (M600 – Android Wear), as well as some of the other Android Wear players.
Of course, ‘later 2017' is a heck of a long ways off, and there are numerous companies that have announced products recently or here at CES (such as New Balance) that are going to be competing for those same dollars, but doing so a whole lot sooner.
Hands-on Video:
Wanna check out that pretty display in full 4K glory? No problem – I've got you covered. Below you'll find how I spent some of my hands-on time with the unit, as well as a look at a portion of the 200+ other watch models that the Fossil group is releasing this year. You know, in case you need more variety in your life.
Don't forget to subscribe to the channel, ensuring you get all the latest video goodness as soon as it hits!
Going Forward:
It'll be interesting to see if and how Misfit's able to move this device from beta to shipping. There are certainly a number of skeptics, and some for good reason. Making a sport GPS watch isn't as easy as it sounds, and getting traction in the crowded wearables market is even harder. Having a product launch ‘later 2017', is a heck of a long time away. And having the name Vapor doesn't help (given the common term vaporware for unreleased products that never make it to fruition).
Still, with Misfit being owned by Fossil now, they certainly have the financial resources to make this happen. It's whether or not they have the engineering resources that's more the question. Fossil Group's wearable experience for smartphone connected devices is strong, but they simply don't have anything in this same ballpark when it comes to complexity. Building their own user interface instead of just leveraging Android Wear 2.0 seems like a risky move.
But more competition in this marketplace is good – especially well priced competition like this. If they can succeed and introduce a stable product later this year in time for the holidays, that could do quite well – especially given Misfit's broad reach in distribution, including big box stores like Best Buy.

With that – thanks for reading!
Don't forget to check out all the CES 2017 coverage, as well as continual updates throughout the day on Twitter. It's gonna be a crazy busy week!
Without any unnecessary ado, let's get straight to the point, listing some successful Google Play debuts within the past couple of weeks.
This is yet another rendition of a mega-popular 2048 game made for Android devices. A number matching game is annoyingly addictive, and I should warn you against trying it out while your work. The interface is colorful and you get to merge tiles with the same number scoring higher points. The game will challenge your mathematical and strategic skills, gobbling up your attention and free time. The game offers classic mode and the time trial mode.
In Marble Kingdom, you get to shoot colorful bubbles to match 3 and more of the same color. The game is easy to learn, but quite difficult to succeed in. The graphics are colorful and you will get to explore secret maps to unveil the treasure. The transmitter allows you to change the position between the next ball and the current. You get the power-ups to increase your score and collect interesting ulockables. Overall, it is a nice time killer for those who would like to explore something different in the match 3 genres.
This is a great game for the origami fans introducing quite an interesting puzzle adventure where you get to fold the paper sheets to create amazing origami figures. The game requires precision and strategy, because you will not want to use too many folds. The game features 3D visuals and an attractive soundtrack with over 70 puzzles to complete. There are hints to help you as you progress. It is free, offering in-app purchases.
Try out RunBot if you're into sci-fi and high-tech. The game has received the recent update fixing some graphical errors and adding some functionality for the game to be compatible with the older devices. RunBot is a 3D infinite runner where you get to run as a very cool advanced robotic weapon system. You're supposed to be a killing machine, but being a highly advanced artificial intelligence you have challenged your orders and escaped. Now, you get to run for freedom avoiding lasers, jumping through obstacles and fighting back drone attacks. Plenty of 3D action, such as racing,, flipping, running and flying will keep the fans of the genre glued to their devices. The 3D graphics are impressive and if you like runners, you definitely need to try RunBot.
While the competition is overwhelming on Google Play, this lightweight Android game received pretty high rating on the marketplace. It is a classic game board where you play against the artificial intelligence taking turns trying to win. It is a classic checker board game, and the rules are simple. We strongly recommend this one for the fans of the classic board games looking for something to keep them entertained, as well as make their brains move while they have a few spare minutes waiting for the bus after work.
It would be fair to say that Google Play is short on quality adventure games and Dream Chamber makes up for that lack for now. It is a beautifully hand-drawn animation game styled a-la 30's dark humor and featuring voiceover acting. The plot is a typical detective murder mystery where a private detective Charlie tries to solve the puzzle, surviving thanks to his wits and humor. You get to uncover the culprit in this humorous adventure taking place in the post-depression America. The cartoon graphic style and beautiful music create a unique atmosphere, and you may want to consider spending $4 on it.
SideSwype is yet another clone of 2048 and Threes, but it is very well worth checking out because it is easier and graphically more impressive than the most. You get to combine “ones” to match them in color, so the sliding puzzle looks like a sort of Tetris in this match game. The visual effects and the simplicity is what make the game stand out from the crowd. The game is addictive as hell – it is elegant and visually impressive match puzzle with a stunning audio and visual background. You get to match 3 or more blocks to destroy them, and score as high as you can. The game costs $1.99 on Google Play and offers no in-app purchases whatsoever.
Mini Warriors takes you to the world of plants versus zombies defense strategy set in the medieval age. Once a peaceful land, Algers is now ravaged by wars and needs a leader to unite the people and fight off the invasion. 2D cartoon graphics accompanied by more than 200 challenging levels offer interesting battle action spiced up with live battles with online players all over the world. The game is free offering in-app purchases.

When then-mayor Rob Ford (open Rob Ford's policard) was found to have overspent his legal 2010 campaign spending limit, Toronto's compliance audit committee voted to do nothing. When former Peterborough MP Dean Del Mastro was convicted of overspending his limit, and trying to cover that up, he was led away to jail in shackles. It is not difficult, at city halls across Ontario, to find complaints about loopholes and contradictions in the provincial laws that govern both towns and cities and the conduct of their candidates and elected officials.

Those laws — the Municipal Elections Act, Municipal Act, Municipal Conflict of Interest Act and City of Toronto Act — are not thrilling reads, but they have dramatic impacts on politicians and local democracy itself. Some calls for reform go back, like 27 recommendations from Justice Douglas Cunningham in his 2011 inquiry into then-Mississauga mayor Hazel McCallion's actions involving failed plans for a luxury hotel and convention centre. Cunningham found McCallion acted in a “real and apparent conflict of interest” but she did not break the narrow rules in the Conflict of Interest Act that apply to politicians' conduct only at council meetings and not at gatherings outside city hall.

That should change, said Cunningham, who also called for a broader range of penalties for council members found in conflict. Currently, if a judge finds them guilty and the act was intentional, they must be removed from office. Justice Charles Hackland, who found Ford guilty of conflict of interest in 2012, also lamented the lack of punishment options. Ford's mayoralty was saved only by an appeal court ruling that hinged on a technicality. “It's sort of a sledgehammer,” is how Toronto lawyer Paul-Erik Veel describes campaign finance rules in another act. “It's very difficult to pick up, very difficult to get it moving, but when you finally do get it moving, it can only result in complete destruction. It's not a very nuanced approach.” Toronto Councillor Maria Augimeri (open Maria Augimeri's policard) says unjust rules cost her about $300,000. That's how much she personally spent in legal and other costs defending her narrow 2010 re-election victory after runner-up Gus Cusimano challenged in court.
Ford hosted a fundraiser to clear his ally Cusimano's expenses not covered by the city, but Toronto's integrity commissioner advised Augimeri no such fundraiser could be held for a councillor. “So the sitting mayor was allowed to fundraise for his boy but I was left twisting in the wind,” said Augimeri, adding she was financially able to draw on family savings while others would have been forced to give up and concede office. “The province needs to make it a fairer playing field.”

Such calls have, for years, gone unheeded. That may be about to change. As part of a periodic review, Ontario's municipal affairs ministry is asking for input from members of the public and municipalities on possible legislative reform. Municipal Affairs Minister Ted McMeekin says he is serious about listening to such stories and hopefully making changes by next spring. That includes fixes and bigger reforms, such as Toronto's request municipalities be able to use ranked ballots to elect council. “We need to clean things up, make rules a bit easier to understand,” McMeekin said on a trip to meet with southwest Ontario politicians. “It's not a matter of getting enough good ideas. I think when the smoke starts to clear it will be a matter of piecing it all together … and it will be made more clear what we need to act on.” The deadline for Municipal Elections Act submissions is July 27. The ministry on Thursday extended the deadline for public feedback on the other laws to Oct. 31, to match municipalties' submission deadlines. Veel, who has represented municipalities in court, wants a streamlining of the process to challenge a candidate's election finances, which under current rules must be initiated by an elector. He would also introduce modest monetary penalties, meted out through an administrative process. Another municipal law expert, John Mascarin, said he would like to see municipal integrity commissioners able to directly punish wayward council members, rather than councillors being asked to sanction their colleagues. Potential penalties should be broadened to include loss of a chairmanship or reduced office budgets. Not everything, however, is up for discussion. Alan Redway, a former East York mayor, is campaigning for a review that could lead to Toronto being de-amalgamated — broken up into smaller municipalities with a citywide government only for regional issues. “The issue of amalgamation and de-amalgamation is not part of the review,” McMeekin said. “That's not a place we're prepared to go at this point.”

Police have launched homicide investigations into the deaths of a 52-year-old Canadian woman and a 36-year-old American man in Belize after a post-mortem examination revealed that both had died from strangulation.
Autopsies were performed on the couple Tuesday morning, Belize's Corozal Police Department confirmed to CTV News.
Francesca Matus and Drew De Voursney were reported missing after they were last seen leaving a local bar in Corozal, Belize on April 25.
After nearly a week of searching, Matus' white SUV was discovered on Sunday in a sugarcane field near the village of Paraiso, located approximately 15 kilometres away from the bar. Police say the couple's bodies were found together a day later in an “advanced state of decomposition” by a search party in a sugarcane field in Chan Chen Village, in the country's northern Corozal District.
Police say both Matus and De Voursney had tape around their wrists then they were found. They believe that murders are a case of a robbery gone wrong.
Matus leaves behind twin 22-year-old sons.
Jackie Logan, a friend of Matus', told CTV Toronto that Matus owned a beachfront property in Belize
“She spent this past winter there and then she was due to come back and she didn't make it on the plane,” Logan said in an emotional interview with CTV Toronto. “She deserves so much better than this. She really does.”
On a rainy Tuesday, friends and neighbours stopped by Matus' Keswick, Ont. home to lay flowers in front of the house. Many expressed shock and disbelief.
“This is just a horrible situation,” neighbour Tony Tallon told CTV Toronto. “Just horrible.”
Neighbour Ryah Lopizzo described Matus as “a good friend” and “a great neighbour.”
“It's just a complete shock that she had to go through this.”

Story highlights New comic book "The Star Wars" adapts and illustrates George Lucas' rough draft script
"It's so similar, yet so different at the same time," says writer J.W. Rinzler
Characters such as Kane Starkiller and a lizard-like Han Solo populate this universe
A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away ...
An Empire has spread across the galaxy, and the few remaining Jedi defend themselves against the Sith. At the same time, a dispute over trade and treaties is interrupted by ... General Luke Skywalker?
A little confused?
That's because these familiar elements from "Star Wars" lore are part of George Lucas' rough draft for the first movie ("Episode IV: A New Hope" for the uninitiated), illustrated for the first time by Dark Horse Comics as "The Star Wars." The first of eight issues of the comic book series is out now.
When Luke is a much older man, Vader doesn't wear a helmet, Han Solo resembles a lizard and there is a character named Kane Starkiller, it might take some getting used to. But it's a fascinating part of movie history, no doubt.
CNN spoke separately to J.W. Rinzler, who adapted Lucas' script for comics, and artist Mike Mayhew.

JUST WATCHED Students use 'The Force' in viral prank Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Students use 'The Force' in viral prank 00:55
CNN: What captured your interest when adapting this script?
Rinzler: It's so similar and yet so different at the same time. All the puzzle pieces are there but arranged to form a different picture. You've got Sith and Jedi, you've got a desert planet. You've got a planet with twin suns, an imperial city and a cloud city. When I read the rough draft, it had all those things which made me want to make it into a comic book. It's such a great story, George is a great storyteller.
CNN: Was it difficult to illustrate this story from a script written nearly 40 years ago?
Mayhew: Not at all. I've been in comics 20 years, and when I read the rough draft, I thought, I can make a comic of this tomorrow. It was just a very well-written screenplay, and that's what a comic book script is. This is genuinely George's first complete screenplay story of this tale, and it's wildly different.
You can see why some of it was changed because there's no way they could have done it. It was just too ambitious.
When you look at movies now like "Avatar" and "The Avengers," it seems prophetic. Audiences expect all that action and set pieces, and one thing after another. I'm sure back then they looked at this and thought, "What's this guy thinking?"
The other interesting thing is you see the origins of the characters we know and love. Darth Vader is kind of a general, he's one of the main heavies but he's not a lord of the Sith. Here, Vader is really three characters: General Vader, this Lord of the Sith named Valorum, and this mechanical man. You think you know these characters and then you discover their truer origins.
CNN: What do you think fans will take away from this book?
Rinzler: Based on early fan feedback from the first issue, they're really enjoying this alternate universe, and they're getting to read a story that's being told by George. Even through my adaptation, you feel his voice. You see many of the things you love in "Star Wars" but in a slightly different way.
You have the Tusken raider moment surging in front of the binoculars, except it's not a Tusken raider, it's a different character. Fans are saying they're reading it two or three times to take it all in.
Mayhew: This to me is the greatest "what if" story in comics. What if this made it to the screen? The mind reels at the possibilities.
CNN: Is there one particular thing that is the farthest away from the "Star Wars" we know and love?
Rinzler: Everyone seems to latch onto the fact that Han is a big green alien. That's pretty far! He doesn't have his own ship. His character is probably the most different, although he can already talk to Wookies. It's fascinating to see all this stuff starting out, in a way.
What's really fun is that R2-D2 talks in this one. There are a couple of points where I felt like "R2-D2 should say something here," and I added a line and that was really fun.
Mayhew: The characters in this story are much different than the characters in "Star Wars." The relationships are a lot different and to me, more intense. Leia's story is a little more complicated, and she's more a part of the action. Annikin is more of a trained Jedi than Luke was. The older General Skywalker to me is so much cooler than Obi-Wan. This character is like Captain America, a bigger than life hero.
CNN: Is there a possibility that this alternate version of "Star Wars" could live on beyond these eight issues, at least in the fans' minds?
Rinzler: Fans have been asking already about this, because so many things are hinted at particularly in the first issue, about the past, or characters in the periphery, or just spoken of and not seen. They'd love to see those mysteries explained, but we have a little movie called "Episode VII" coming up and that will take precedence.
Like just about everyone else, political extremists with the potential for violence have gone online. Everything from diatribes by known terrorists to recruitment videos make their first appearances on websites, leading many, both in government and out, wondering how best to tackle the dangers that this material (and the people behind it) poses. A new study by the The International Centre For The Study Of Radicalisation And Political Violence (ICSR) has performed an analysis of the issues and released a report that suggests the best way to deal with the material may be to tackle the offline activities of those who produce it.
The ICSR is a joint project formed by an international coalition of academic institutions. The current report, however, is focused on the British experience, suggesting it was primarily the product of people based at King's College, London. Although some of the material in the report is specific to the UK, a fair bit of it probably applies fairly generally to the experience in other nations.
One of the first of the things that probably applies to most countries is that a lack of a thorough understanding of the Internet heightens fear of what's happening online; without knowing the features and limits of online communications, people have exaggerated concerns. "Awful things are said to happen on extremist websites and in Internet chat rooms, but few are able to identify what exactly it is that causes so much concern," the authors wrote. "As a result, many of the policy proposals that are currently in circulation are either irrelevant or unworkable."
One example the authors provide is that many citizens think the same approaches that target sexual exploitation of children online should work with material associated with violent extremists groups. Not so, the authors conclude: "The comparison with efforts to counter child sexual abuse on the Internet is flawed, because much of the material involved in child sexual abuse is clearly illegal and there are no political constituencies which might be offended if repressive action is taken against it." The typical content of extremist groups contains a mixture of threats and speech that is protected in most liberal democracies due to its political nature. Accordingly, a blanket attack on extremist content is likely to produce a political backlash, since it will inevitably encompass content from mainstream political groups.
Because extremist content encompasses such a broad range of material, the approach commonly taken with exploitative imagery—some sort of content filtering—won't work, according to the authors. (Given the Australian experience, it's somewhat surprising they think this sort of filtering is working, but the authors highlight BT's Cleanfeed project as a success.) Lots of extremist content is dynamic—it takes place on message boards and in chatrooms—and the rest can be easily moved or mirrored.
Blacklists would backfire
More generally, the authors argue that the sort of blacklists required for these systems will inevitably be discovered. When they are, because the topic is so high-profile, the list of banned sites will inevitably receive significant publicity, which is exactly the sort of thing that extremists need. The same thing goes, the report argues, for things like legal efforts to take down extremist content; the material is typically moved overseas, and gets a lot of publicity in the process.
The authors build a persuasive case that, given the mobile nature of the content itself, it makes far more sense to go after the people behind it, since it's harder to move people than content. This, they argue, has a significant legal advantage, too: if the people are truly dangerous and have made threats, then the law typically contains statutes that can be applied without being subject to the legal vagaries that arise with online content.
More generally, they contend that most extremist material is simply a way of preaching to the converted. The actual recruitment and indoctrination activities of most extremist groups takes place offline, with online material largely serving a maintenance role. In many cases, the authors argue, individuals wouldn't even know where to find online material if it weren't for their real-world contacts telling them where to look.
If this part of their prescription seems compelling, the remainder of their recommendations seem to vary in quality. The other two recommendations made by the ICSR involve government programs. The first would be to improve media literacy instruction in schools so that students are better equipped to evaluate the credibility of information and its sources online. That would clearly solve a lot of problems beyond extremist material, but rolling out a sufficiently rigorous educational program could take years.
Another solution offered by the report's authors would be for the government to provide funding for an independent group that would dole out money for counter-initiatives. Almost by definition, the authors argue, the government has little or no credibility with the target audience for extremists, and its association with a program can easily kill the intended message. Basically, the independent organization is intended to provide a layer of abstraction that would help independent organizations maintain the trust of the audiences they are trying to reach. The authors also emphasize that the group has to fund a broad range of efforts; funding efforts to counter radical Islamists without dealing with the UK's homegrown racist groups would also damage the organization's credibility.
Finally, they promote the formation of an "Internet Users Panel" that would ensure that ISPs take complaints about extremist content seriously. Although this might be preferable to the sort of scattershot, Andrew Cuomo-style censorship that has taken place in the US, the authors' use of the phrase "collective power of Internet users" makes it sound more like a pitch for a Web 2.0 company than a helpful method of limiting the flow of this material.
The ICSR report is interested in that it's one of the few that has gone beyond describing the problem and has listed potential ways of tackling the spread of extremist content online. In essence, however, it concludes that the same features that make putting other material online—convenience and cost—will always make it an appealing media for extremists, which explains why its recommendations focus on offline solutions.
The T-God is on the move as Team Naventic have signed Thomas "Tomster" Maguire. The organization announced the signing on their website Thursday.
The former Tempo Storm player will play ranged, allowing Fan "Fan" Yang to move to melee/flex while Chris "Zuna" Buechter will play warrior.
"I think my new teammates are a lot more strict and hardworking them I'm used to," Tomster told theScore esports. "But [they] can still have a lot of fun and laugh in games which is always a nice thing to have on a team.
"I think fans can expect the best performance I've ever done on this team"
Tomster's first big success in the competitive scene came with King of Blades' roster, where he earned accolades at the NA Spring Regional for his melee play, particularly on Greymane, though he says that he expects Greymane to be nerfed soon.
"I actually don't know why they buffed Greymane," Tomster said. "He is in a good spot at the moment with that he is supposed to do, but they just made his damage so much higher for no reason. I mean, I like the changes because I love Greymane, but they weren't needed at all and probably will be reverted to some extent in the upcoming patches."
After King of Blades' team left their former organization and assumed the moniker of Gust or Bust, Tomster left to join Tempo Storm, where he moved to the ranged/flex role.
"I think ranged is a lot more fun to play at the moment and I feel like I'm not 100% confident on the meta melees (Kerrigan, Zera, Illidan)," Tomster said. "So I wanted to play ranged, and I feel like I look at my positioning and the map a lot more on ranged than on melee and I feel like I play a whole lot better since I just look around more."
Tempo's performance during the summer season did not improve, with the team qualifying at the final invitational qualifier with a 2-0 win over Hot Dog Burglars but then finishing 7-8th at the regional in Burbank.
Josh "Gauntlet" Bury wants to see Fan play Illidan again. You can find him on Twitter.
People were found trying to send the old notes abroad by falsely declaring them as articles such as books. (HT Photo)
The customs department has unearthed a new modus operandi of sending demonetised Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes abroad by courier to get them converted here later.
After these high denomination notes were taken out of circulation by the government in November last, Non-Resident Indians (NRIs) were given a longer window till June 30 to get them exchanged, whereas citizens who were in the country at that time were allowed to deposit the old notes till December 30, 2016.
Customs officials have registered a few cases, where demonetised banknotes were sent abroad by courier, and seized over Rs 1 lakh in such notes, a senior official said on Sunday.
People were found trying to send the old notes abroad by falsely declaring them as articles such as books, he said.
“The aim could be to take help of their relatives or friends abroad to get the old notes exchanged with the new ones,” the official said.
In two cases, couriers were booked from Punjab for Australia and the content inside them were declared as book.
The customs official, who are keeping an eye on outbound parcels at foreign post office here, found them having demonetised notes.
Similar consignments were booked for Korea and the United Arab Emirates containing the defunct notes. Such cases have also been registered at foreign post offices located across the country, the official said.
The RBI allowed Indian citizens, who were abroad during November-December 2016, to exchange the scrapped notes up to March 31 and NRIs up to June 30.
This facility is available at RBI offices in Mumbai, Delhi, Kolkata, Chennai and Nagpur only.
NRIs coming to India are required to come through Red Channel disclosing to the Customs authorities at the airport the amount of the demonetised notes and secure a certificate to be tendered at the RBI at the time of exchange.

DETROIT (AP) — A federal appeals court on Friday struck down Michigan's ban on the consideration of race and gender in college admissions, saying it burdens minorities and violates the U.S. Constitution.
The 2-1 decision upends a sweeping law that forced the University of Michigan and other public schools to change admission policies. The 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said the law, approved by voters in 2006, violates the 14th Amendment's Equal Protection Clause.
The court mostly was concerned about how the affirmative action ban was created. Because it was passed as an amendment to the state constitution, it can only be changed with another statewide vote. This places a big burden on minorities who object to it, judges R. Guy Cole Jr. and Martha Craig Daughtrey said.
The ban's supporters could have chosen "less onerous avenues to effect political change," the judges said in the court's opinion.
Arizona, California, Nebraska and Washington state have similar bans, but they won't be affected by the Michigan decision. The court ruling is limited to Michigan and other states in the 6th Circuit: Kentucky, Ohio and Tennessee.
The judges cited two U.S. Supreme Court cases, one in 1969 involving the repeal of a fair housing law in Akron, Ohio, and the other in 1982 involving an effort to stop racial integration in Seattle schools.
"They provide the benchmark for when the majority has not only won, but also rigged the game to reproduce its success indefinitely," Cole and Daughtrey said.
The American Civil Liberties Union, which was part of a coalition that challenged the Michigan ban, hailed the court's decision.
The "ruling has kept the door open for thousands of academically qualified students of color to continue to pursue the American dream through our state's colleges and universities," said Kary Moss, an ACLU spokeswoman in Detroit.
A dissenting judge, Julia Smith Gibbons, said there was nothing wrong with the ban or the way it passed.
"The Michigan voters have ... not restructured the political process in their state by amending their state constitution; they have merely employed it," she said.
A message seeking comment was left with the Michigan attorney general's office, which defended the law and could ask the full appeals court to take the case. Such requests are rarely granted. Gov. Rick Snyder, a Republican who has said he opposed the 2006 constitutional amendment, had no immediate comment. He was elected last year.
The ban, which also affected government hiring, was approved by 58 percent of voters. In 2008, a federal judge in Detroit upheld it, saying it was race-neutral because no single race can benefit.
Jennifer Gratz, a Michigan native who successfully sued the University of Michigan over racial preferences before the 2006 referendum, predicted Friday's decision eventually will be thrown out.
"It's just a blip. The full 6th Circuit or the Supreme Court will take it," Gratz said. "Judges are not supreme rulers. The people voted."
A business group, Michigan Roundtable for Diversity and Inclusion, praised the ruling.
"This is one place where government should be acting more like a business, and the 6th Circuit court decision gives governments and universities the tools they need to improve diversity and inclusion," said Debbie Dingell, a former General Motors executive.
The rumored LG E900 was caught on highly blurry video a few days back and now, thanks to that shot of pretty decent quality, we can finally get an idea what to expect. Still, the E900 features remains a mystery which, however, should be solved soon.
LG E900 runs Windows Phone 7 and poses for a shot
The first devices based on the Windows Phone 7 platform are expected in October so it's not strange that we spot more and more of them in the wild even if none has been officially unveiled yet. Today's addition to the list of rumored WP7 phones is the LG E900.
This image sure is of quite high quality (unlike the LG E900 video we came upon this Monday), but, sadly, it doesn't reveal any of the E900 features, save the obvious one - the touchscreen.

Biometric technology was once the stuff of sci-fi—how many movies show someone having their hand or eye scanned to get entry into a secured facility? But today biometric tech can be found in millions of people's pockets—as the fingerprint scanner on an iPhone.
Of course, fingerprint scanning isn't foolproof. Hackers have stolen fingerprints from photos, and used fake prints to fool Apple's touch ID. Plus, there's always the brute force method, like the time a gang in Malaysia cut off a guy's fingertip—with a machete—to interface with the fingerprint-recognition system on the victim's Mercedes.
But there's a lesser-known biometric,that might be a bit harder to counterfeit: brainwaves. "In the biometric textbook table of contents, often the brain biometrics were listed as ‘Esoteric Biometrics.' So I guess people have thought about it for many years, but it's been considered sort of esoteric." Sarah Laszlo, a psychologist at Binghamton University, part of the State University of New York.
To test the potential of brainwave biometrics, Laszlo and her colleagues attached electrodes to the scalps of 45 volunteers. They then recorded an electroencephalogram, or EEG—a reading of the brain's electrical activity—as the subjects watched acronyms flash on a computer screen. Turns out that each acronym—FBI, DVD, VCR—sets off a unique pattern of activation in your brain, which corresponds to an electrical signature. And each person has slightly different so-called "brainprints." Different enough that computers were able to uniquely identify the study volunteers by their brainwaves 94 percent of the time. That effect held up when the subjects were retested six months later. The results are in the journal Neurocomputing. [Blair C. Armstrong et al, Brainprint: Assessing the uniqueness, collectability, and permanence of a novel method for ERP biometrics]
Of course 94 percent accuracy won't cut it at the NSA. "I was told by a researcher at a secure cyberspace conference in January that there's something called the rule of 5s. Which means you need 99.99999—five nines, the rule of five—to be used as a practical biometric."
But Laszlo and her colleagues are trying out new ideas for upping the test's accuracy. Like showing "pictures of polarizing celebrities, like Kim Kardashian or Kanye West. And also images of foods that some people tend to really like and some people tend to really stay away from, things like sushi." The idea being that polarizing images might elicit more specific brainprints.
As for blackmail? "A brainprint, unlike a fingerprint or a retinal scan, is something that would be immune to sort of gun-to-the-head or blackmail sort of situation. Brain activity changes if you're stressed. That's very well known. And you can cut someone's finger off. But you can't cut someone's brain out. You can't do it." Future spies will simply have to find a way to replicate the brainwaves of their foes themselves. And, actually, one of Laszlo's students is already studying how to do just that.

Ghostbusters director Paul Feig is still battling those Internet trolls while ignoring why his movie was doomed.
Paul Feig can rock a finely tailored suit. He's far less comfortable defending his Ghostbusters reboot.
The veteran director steered a can't miss brand into a ditch. Media reports suggested the film ended up losing $70 million for Sony Pictures. That's no easy feat given how beloved the Ghostbusters brand is to this day.
And he's still defending his role in the production.
Feig recently took to the pages of The Hollywood Reporter to put a shiny spin on the debacle. Entitled, ‘Ghostbusters' Director Paul Feig: What I Learned About Being a Woman This Year,' the op-ed breaks down the project from its earliest stages.
First, he says he thought casting four women as the paranormal heroes was a novel way to approach a reboot. Fair enough, to a point.
Then, Feig starts to play fast and loose with reality.
My goal in doing this new Ghostbusters was to assemble the funniest people working today, just as original director Ivan Reitman had done.
<<< Please support MRC's NewsBusters team with a tax-deductible contribution today. >>>
Wait … did Feig want an all-female cast or simply the funniest stars of today … who happen to be all female? Already you sense he's in full spin mode. And, for what it's worth, original Ghostbuster Ernie Hudson wasn't one of the funniest stars of the '80s.
Sadly, the media kept reporting only on the negativity and insisted on referring to us solely as the “all-female Ghostbusters.” I mean, it's 2016. Are we really that shocked that four women can star in a movie?
Swapping out the genders of the leads is a big deal, obviously. Pretending otherwise is just silly.
This film never was meant to be political. But, ridiculously, it became just that.
Again, he's not being honest. In one breath he's trying to strike a blow for women in Hollywood with the gender switcheroo. Then, he's insisting recasting an iconic male comedy with women isn't political.
Hogwash.
A much better idea, frankly, would be to make the ghostbusters both men and women. Then you could truly say, “hey, we hired the funniest folks we could, and a few happened to be women.”
Making all four leads female, and then adding a “himbo” to the cast (sorry, Chris Hemsworth), only doubled down on the gender politics.
The funniest part of Feig's essay comes next.
I am daily inundated by tweets and correspondence from women and girls (as well as men and boys) who have been inspired by our Ghostbusters, who made the costumes for Halloween and for all the Comic-Cons worldwide and who have told me, “If I'd had this movie when I was younger, I would have been an engineer or a scientist now.”
Really? Young women need a silly comedy about women busting ghosts to influence their careers? Was the film truly a scientific inspiration, or just a FX-laden lark? Young girls who never saw the new Ghostbusters simply couldn't imagine a career in science?
The magazine's print edition features a sidebar where Feig offers advice for dealing with online trolls.
“Just don't engage. Period.”
Of course, Feig didn't always live up to that. He once cursed out some trolls in a fit of anger, an understandable reaction for any social media dweller. Then his advice took a political turn. He invoked First Lady Michelle Obama's “when they go low, we go high” mantra.
Of course, this is the same director who rewrote his movie to make fun of online trolls. He also stood by while his stars blasted said trolls over and again in press interviews.
Sounds pretty low, no?
Feig remains a big league talent, witness hits like Spy and Bridesmaids. He deserves credit for proving to Hollywood that women can lead major franchises without apology.
He's still not seeing the wreckage that is the Ghostbusters reboot clearly.

Image caption Shares of Youku and Tudou surged on the New York Stock Exchange after the deal was announced
China's two largest online video firms, Youku and Tudou, have agreed to merge in a bid to cut costs and boost their market share.
Youku is to acquire rival Tudou via a stock swap deal valued at $1bn (£640m).
The two companies have seen their losses widen in recent months because of the rising costs of acquiring and streaming video content.
The merger will create the biggest online video firm in China, the world's largest internet market.
"The fact that we are the two strongest brands in the market, the content scale as well as the ability to have two differentiated brands... will make us both much stronger competitors," said Victor Koo chairman and chief executive of Youku.
Back to profitability?
Youku's net loss widened 32% from a year earlier in the fourth quarter of last year to 49.6m yuan ($7.9m; £5m).
Tudou also reported a net loss of 148.9m yuan during the period.
According to analysts, competition between the two firms to buy rights to video content and to attract advertisers to their respective websites have caused the losses.
They believe that a merger will not only reduce licensing costs but also give the new entity, which is expected to have a market share of more than 35%, more leverage in negotiating with advertisers.
According to some estimates, a joint operation may result in savings of between $50m to $60m over the next 18 months.
"It (the deal) is a sign of how difficult this market is and both companies have probably realized how hard the road ahead would be if they went the independent route," said Bill Bishop, an independent analyst based in Beijing.
"It should help them get to profitability."

September 30, 2009
Today started not unlike any other. Except that one of my friends emailed me a story about how a company called American Police Force has moved into a town south of me called Hardin, and how they were “taking over that jail that was built and never opened”. Now most Montanans are aware of this financial OOPS that was this modern jail. It was built, and never opened because it was not built to specs in accordance with prisoner housing requirements pursuant to Montana State Law.
The new prison facility in Hardin, Montana.
When I started reading the KULR 8 news stations reports on this “American Police Force”, it immediately made me suspicious as that is totally against the idea of police. Our police are hired and mandated by the local governments they are local to. They are required to go to what's called POST, or Peace Officer's Standards of Training. This school is mandatory by Montana Law prior to be appointed as a “sworn peace officer”.
With these concerns in mind, I started making phone calls. I started with Becky Shay, who was the Billings Gazette reporter who initially broke the story. I spent an hour and a half with her and talked about all of the details. She and I had a positive talk where she assured me that she was “thankful for the chance to be able to talk to people like me.” I was appalled to hear that this company had “no intention of revealing who their parent company is”. Ms. Shay confided in me that she went from a reporter's salary and conditions “driving a '99 Dodge Intrepid with a broken tie rod and bad front brakes”, to “a brand new black SUV that she doesn't have to pay the gas bill for”. My jaw was on the floor. Story breaker straight to the being the mouth of the beast…
Ms. Shay also told me that there are people in Hardin that are so grateful for APF's presence, that they literally opened their homes to her if she needed a place to say. Now this SOUNDS great and all, but it also sounded very manufactured. This conversation went down as if Ms. Shay was trying to sell me something. I read some things about how APF arrived in Hardin, Montana with the words: Hardin Police on the door. This is IMPERSONATING A POLICE OFFICER. They had NO RIGHT to bear that title. They are NOT sworn as peace officers. They have NO AUTHORITY!
[efoods]It was shortly before I ended this call on a positive note, that Ms. Shay expressed a GREAT interest in talking to Alex. I told her that I would be contacting the AJ show. I was told by her that I was TOTALLY 100% OK'd to use ALL of the content in any further correspondence. I then called Mr. Al Pedersen who is the Executive Director of Two Rivers Authority, the financial entity that is in charge of attempting to rebuild Hardin's infrastructure. I asked Mr. Pedersen to elaborate how a private military company could move into a town, take over a prison that did not meet Montana Code, and dare to emblazon “Hardin Police” on their doors…Mr. Pedersen cursed me out, and hung up on me. I called him back, got his voicemail, and left the message that since he could not see fit to talk to me civilly, that I would be calling all of my elected officials as well as CNN and CSPAN. No reply.
I then proceeded to call KULR8 news in Billings, Montana. They expressed concern about how a near 20 year career reporter could simply sell out and go to work for the very company SHE ousted! The person I spoke to said, “she got herself a bigger paycheck, can't fault her for that!”. This person also conceded that it was a sell out situation, and was sick. I than called the Office of the Montana Governor Brian Schweitzer. The person who answered the phone assured me that Gov. Schweitzer was watching this situation and would see to it that there was NOTHING illegal or unconstitutional going on, and that his office would NOT allow these people to overstep any legal boundaries. They didn't want to talk about how the APF showed up labelled as “police”. This conversation was abruptly ended by the intern.
I then called the Office of Max Baucus' Billings location who denied any knowledge. Although Schweitzer, Baucus, and Mt Senator Jon Tester were sued by Two Rivers Authority to allow this prison to be used by a private entity…wherein a judge overturned Montana Law in order to allow this prison to be used privately without disclosing where the prisoners are coming from, or their nature. This company is known to be affiliated with Blackwater Security now known as XE, as well as other PMC's.

When you're writing, what comes first? Song titles, melodies, music? Well it took me a long time to write the album as it's listed. I was writing a lot since the last record came out, but for some reason, 70% of what I was writing didn't feel right for me. So if I'm lucky enough to have an experience that really impacts me, it comes with a verse and a melody. From there I ad lib it. But they come together, the melody and the words come together. But it happens rarely for me.
What do you mean? Actually having that happen, where it just sort of comes. I remember with “Carmen,” I was out really late and walking to the tempo of my own rhythm, and then I just started singing, “Carmen, Carmen doesn't have a problem lying to herself cause her liquor's top shelf.” And it was an easy cadence. The whole thing just came, and I think I was in a really good place then, so it was like things...it was really easy to channel.
What defines being in a good place? Feeling really happy and just circumstantially like nothing's going wrong, which becomes more difficult but that's only my experience. I think a lot of people think the whole thing is really great. Making Brooklyn my home base for the last two and a half weeks has really helped me out, like I've actually started thinking conceptually that I have this addition, an addition to this record that could come really easily. That hasn't happened in a long time. Not since I wrote that Paradise addition to Born to Die, which I really loved.
Did you miss Brooklyn? I missed Brooklyn. I missed the people.
How are the people here different? They're not different. I'm a little different. The vibe is the same. I met some guys from here last week I had never met before, and they were just really easygoing. All artist types—writing during the day and hanging out at bars at night. I miss that, I like that. I haven't really found that in California yet. I relocated there because my record got a little bit bigger, but I didn't really find a music scene that I was a part of. There was something happening—there was kind of a reemerging Laurel Canyon sound. Jonathan Wilson, Father John Misty, and I really liked those guys. I felt like maybe I had something in common with them and I slipped right into that atmosphere really well.
Let's talk Ultraviolence. The crop of the photo on the album cover is similar to the crop of your first two album covers. I liked that, I wanted the continuity. I didn't have that for the album cover at the time and I wanted it to be a continuation of the story. I did like the idea of it being in black and white so that there was, literally and figuratively more to be revealed. Even color-wise.
You wanted a continuation in aesthetic for this album cover, is that something that was important to you musically for Ultraviolence as well? Yeah. Not being misleading in terms of your personal aesthetic, like your psyche coming through design-wise and musically—I like continuity.
You have this way of exacting your creative vision through so many different parts of your art—music videos, lyrics, tone and the melody, style of dress. Are those things that you plan ahead when you think about an album? Is it a concept that grows from one idea? I don't know. I was in college at Fordham when I was 18. I was living between Brooklyn and New Jersey and I was working with this guy who was more famous than anyone I had met at the time, this producer David Kahne. I had that record—you know they shelved it for two years—and I had all this time to think about what was really important to me and what I actually wanted to do if I had the opportunity to do what I wanted. I knew that I wanted to make life easy for myself in the way that I would always be living in a world I constructed and whatever felt true to me, regardless of however that appeared to other people. That definitely extended to song titles, whether I shot in black and white, hair color, things like that. It's not really something that I planned ahead. I had a sense that I wanted the world I lived in to be really personalized to what I liked.
When I hear the words “ultra” and “violence,” I think about WorldStarHipHop. What does the phrase mean to you? That's funny. I feel connected to two emotions—aggression and softness. I like that luxe sound of the word “ultra” and the mean sound of the word “violence” together. I like that two worlds can live in one.
What's the relationship between violence and love? I like a physical love. I like a hands-on love. [Pauses.] How can I say this without getting into too much trouble? I like a tangible, passionate love. For me, if it isn't physical, I'm not interested. Everything I do feels so organized: touring, playing a show night after night with a couple months in between to make a record, and being in charge of all of it—mixing, mastering. Sometimes I meet people with a lot of fire and energy. Mentally, maybe we're not that similar. Telepathically, we're not on that same wavelength. If there's a physicality and a chemistry, that ends up winning for me every time because it's the opposite of what I have every day.
Who's the last person you met who made you feel like that? Dan Auerbach, for better or for worse.
UH student attempting to break Guinness record for disc golf holes in 24 hours

As he finishes his junior year at the University of Houston, Cody Miller is also preparing for a personal endurance contest.
On May 17-18, he will attempt to break the Guinness World Record for the number of disc golf holes completed in 24 hours. He will be playing at the course in Bobby Ford Park in Richwood, about 50 miles south of Houston.
Disc golf is played much like traditional golf, except the "ball" is a Frisbee or other flying disc and the "holes" are elevated containers, such as a metal basket. The sport, which was formalized in the 1970s, is an inexpensive pastime that can be played by a wide variety of people, according to the Professional Disc Golf Association.
The existing world record was set by Michael Sales, who in February 2013, played 1,310 holes in 24 hours at Isla Vista Peace Course in Goleta, California, according to Guinness.
Miller, who is studying public relations, took up disc golf a couple years ago after swimming competitively at Cypress Creek High School and in his first year of college at University of Texas - Permian Basin in Odessa.
When he transferred to UH for his sophomore year, he decided it was time for a change.
"I needed something else to do," he said.
For Miller, the attempt to break the world record is not just a gimmick but a chance to draw attention to the problem of human trafficking in Houston.
In the weeks before the competition, he's asking supporters to donate to the Houston Rescue and Restore Coalition, which works to prevent modern-day slavery. Anyone who would like to contribute can do so through this page.
On the day of the competition, he will be accompanied by volunteers who will cover the tasks of handing him a fresh disc at each hole so he doesn't to stoop to pick it up (he's taking a stack of 20), recording his score and videotaping the entire event.
"Two disc golf officials will make sure I follow all the rules, making sure every hole is completed," he said.
One advantage of the course at Bobby Ford Park, Miller said, is that it's "really short," with an average of 110 feet between holes. Although short, it's considered legitimate by the disc golf association's governing body, he said.
"They said, 'We'll recognize the record if you break it at that court,' " Miller said.
Miller also enjoys playing at other courses and has visited more than 100, including about 25 that are out of state.
Image copyright Metropolitan Police Image caption Evidence of Beale lying about the rapes came to light when police investigated a separate allegation
A "serial liar" who made a series of bogus sexual assault allegations against 15 men has been jailed for 10 years.
Jemma Beale, 25, claimed she was raped by nine men and sexually assaulted by six, all strangers, in four encounters spanning three years.
One allegation led to the conviction of a man who was jailed for seven years.
Beale from Hounslow was found guilty of perjury and perverting the course of justice at Southwark Crown Court.
Judge Nicholas Loraine-Smith told Beale, who was in a relationship with a woman: "This trial has revealed, what was then not obvious, that you are a very, very convincing liar and you enjoy being seen as a victim.
"The prosecution described your life as a 'construct of bogus victimhood'.
"These offences usually began as a drunken attempt to get your partner's sympathy or perhaps to arouse her jealousy.
"They each began impulsively, but what is particularly chilling is the manner in which you persisted in making allegations which you knew were untrue even to the extent of committing and repeating perjury."
'Perverse impact'
Image copyright Christopher Hilton Image caption Police spent 6,400 hours investigating Beale's lies at a cost of at least £250,000, and the trial at Southwark Crown Court cost at least £109,000
Prosecutor Madeleine Wolfe told the court police spent 6,400 hours investigating Beale's lies at a cost of at least £250,000, and the trial cost at least £109,000.
"Cases such as this bring a real risk that a woman who has been raped or sexually assaulted does not complain to the police for fear of not being believed", the judge added.
"False allegations are likely to have the perverse impact of increasing the likelihood of guilty men going free."
In a victim impact statement, Mahad Cassim, who was wrongly convicted of raping Beale in 2010, told the court he had been hugely affected by the false claim.
"One of my goals is to be a successful businessman, to have a nice family and be happy," he said.
"I am working on the happiness - I have a long way to go."
Beale had also falsely claimed she was groped by a stranger, Noam Shahzad, in a pub in July 2012.
She alleged she was then gang-raped by him and other men, and even self-inflicted injuries to back up her claims she was assaulted with barbed wire.
The following year Beale fabricated similar allegations against six other men.
She claimed two strangers sexually assaulted her and said she was gang raped again, by four others, two months later.
Last weekend I took part in a Oculus Rift Game Jam in Dusiburg. The goal of the jam was to get to know the Oculus Rift system better and build a game for it.
We meet friday evening in a room at the second floor of the university which was almost very dark inside (because the time of the year) . First I didn't know exactly where to go so it was kind of funny to wander around.
We were six people in total so the team was already found. After trying out some OR Demos we quickly developed a concept for our game: It should be a musical exploration adventure with candys and other weird stuff.
At the end of the first day there was also a party ongoing in a building near us. So some of us took that opportunity to get some extra fun before we needed to rest some hours.
We could finnish most content for the game very quickly. So in the end it got bigger than it was planned: There are three normal levels and one very difficult bonus level (Uber level). The goal for the player is to find all the objects in a level which are able to make music. After he activated all of them, the whole song will play and the exit door will open.
You can also play it without Oculus Rift (on Windows), but you wouldn't get the full experience. Keep that in mind ;-)

And don't forget to take a look at the readme file ;-)
There has been a lot of talk around here about the condition of our Offensive line. With all the talk about the health and turnover of our line, we need to consider the advantage our Offensive Line will have when compared the opponents Offensive Line and it is a big one. We are running basically the same scheme that we have used for the last few years. The opposition is not. Our opponents have changed offensive systems this offseason (par for the course for that team) to a "West Coast Offensive" (short passing game) with a "Zone Blocking Line Scheme".
Explaining a west coast offense would require about a few fan posts of its own, but the fundamentals of Zone Blocking can be easily grasped. Before that explanation, though, we'll review basic conventional blocking after the break…
Drive Blocking
The basic technique, when the Offensive lineman is trying to push their man backwards. My Grandpa called this "knock the stuffings out of the guy in front of you".
Hook Blocking
In this technique, the blockers are trying to force the D-linemen laterally down the line of scrimmage. Note the seals set on the outside. Also note the center, he can free up a guard by taking on a DT; the free Guard can then pull to the play side to block for a ball carrier; using two offensive linemen to set the edge was Vince Lomardi's innovation that became known as the Packer Sweep.
Angle Blocking
A variation of the basic drive, but instead of pushing the defense backwards, the Offensive line is trying to force the defenders at the line of scrimmage off their spots and move them in the same direction. Variations of this involve a pull by the Tackle or TE to the direction away from the angle (a "down" block). This blocking scheme is used in trap plays, bootleg or reverse runs, speed options (see the second Denver game last year), and screens.
And now, Zone Blocking
Understanding how this scheme is supposed to work begins with the individual offensive lineman and whether he is "covered" or "uncovered". A covered lineman means that he has a defender lined up directly opposite of him. Conversely, an offensive lineman is uncovered when there is space directly in front of him. In this diagram, both Guards and the TE are uncovered against the 3-4 defense's front 7.
What the Zone Blocking Scheme is trying to accomplish is to create overloads at certain points along the line. This starts with the first step by a COVERED lineman:
In a traditional blocking schemes, the offensive lineman's first step is into the defender. With the slide step, the gap between O-linemen extends from the standard 18 inches to a yard or a little more. The defensive end's natural reaction is to penetrate that gap and disrupt. The scheme plays off this instinct and coaching by giving him a gap right at the snap. But, if things work right, the DE should be stopped with the second step…
Either way the DE has moved, the RT should have leverage to move him further outside or drive him into his Guard help that is looking to create the overload on the right. The uncovered guard has used angle block technique toward the DE:
This scheme requires a LOT of discipline and practice by the Offensive lineman. These men are used to double – teaming a player, but the Zone Blocking Scheme lives or dies on overloading a POSITION on the field. This can be a tough adjustment for an offensive lineman. This also requires EXCELLENT communication between the Guard and Tackle here, depending on how the ‘backer reacts. If he reacts in or to the DE, the Guard must disengage and pick him up. If he goes outside, the Tackle leaves the DE and engages the LB outside. Both linemen leaving the DE usually results in disaster, leaving the LB free probably results in no gain or maybe a yard or two. Whoopee...
Now let's look at the entire line of scrimmage. Here we have a pretty common defensive look for the Bolts, our base 3-4 with the Sam LB crowding the TE at the line of scrimmage. The "B" in this diagram will be Jarrett Johnson on Monday Night. The dotted circles are pre-snap and the solid circles are after the first step taken at the snap.
Observe that all the covered linemen are taking a slide step in one direction and all the uncovered linemen are all angle blocking in the same direction. Here, the offensive coordinator has created what he hopes will be a 3 on 2 situations to the right, with the G or T looking to disengage and take on the closest ILB when the ILB commits. There is a 2 on 1 that the NT has to deal with and the Left Guard will look to disengage and block the other ILB when he can. So what kind of play does this basic Zone Blocking Scheme set –up for the run?
Now comes the RB's part to play in this offense – his responsibility is to read where his hole is and get there. The system demands a back with good vision, a measure of patience, good burst, and most of all, being able to cut-back. See the play below:
The back can start to the left side and hit the hole between LT and LG, with the option of cutting back right to go between C-RG hole. A variation is a pitch to the HB for him to take advantage of a seal on the right (if it's there) or cut back to the C-RG hole. The challenge for the defense is to win your individual battle if you have one, or absorb the double team and keep your LB's clean. This is not an easy task, particularly if the defensive lineman tries to change direction to make a play. Usually, a change of direction will cause the defender to lose leverage and end up on the ground.
This blocking scheme also lends itself to play action passes – defenders get used to the initial slide steps to one side or another and look to stay engaged with the lineman to free up the LB's. And the LB's have a tougher time diagnosing the play when the blocking starts off looking exactly like all of the running plays they have seen.
So how does the opponnent playing thir first game using this scheme benefit us? As you can tell, the communication on pre-snap line calls has to be superb. Additionally, the timing and knowledge of which O -Linemen are going to release and hit the 2nd level is a big deal. Finally, McFadden's recognition of where to run has been accurate or the play will fail. The Bolts facing they who must not be named's new scheme for the first time it has been used in a game that matters may give our favorite team the edge they need to win.
Young Family Affordability Rankings
Supported by emerging careers, our young family is headed by an interpreter and a personal care aide—a 26-year-old husband and his 27-year-old wife, respectively. The Bureau of Labor Statistics projects that over the next years, personal care aides and interpreters will remain two of the nation's fastest-growing careers, which suit the young parents who run our household. The family includes a 2-year-old child and maintains a Low-Cost Food Plan. In order to rank the cities according to annual affordability, we consider our young family's preferred housing characteristics: a house or an apartment that's 1,750 square feet, including two (or three) bedrooms, is a desirable home for our young family. Results are applicable to other households whose annual incomes fit within the range of earnings for the demographic.
We rank each city by calculating the percentage of affordable housing preferred by our young family. Cities are grouped into affordability brackets, based on the demographic's annual household income and realistic cost of living, and then sorted by discretionary income, which is the yearly amount remaining from earnings after covered expenses. Annual household income draws on data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics; and the realistic cost of living derives from our formula of seven factors—housing, food, utilities, child care, taxes, health care and transportation. Our full methodology is available here.
WASHINGTON -- Republican presidential contender Ron Paul said Sunday he wants to end federal student loans, calling it a "failed program" that has put students $1 trillion in debt when there are no jobs and when the quality of education has deteriorated.
Paul unveiled a plan last week to cut $1 trillion from the federal budget that would eliminate five Cabinet departments, including education. He's also wanting young workers to be able to opt out of Social Security.
The student loan program is not part of those cuts, but Paul said Sunday on NBC's "Meet the Press" that he'd kill the loan program eventually if he were president. That could put him at odds with some of his young followers, many of whom are college students.
Paul blamed government intervention in the economy for rising tuition.
"Just think of all this willingness to want to help every student get a college education," said Paul, who graduated from Gettysburg College in Pennsylvania before earning a medical degree at the Duke University School of Medicine. "I went to school when we had none of those. I could work my way through college and medical school because it wasn't so expensive."
Annual tuition for Gettysburg College is $42,610 for the 2011-2012 academic year. Annual tuition at Duke's medical school runs $46,621, according to its web site.
Amid such rising costs, borrowing for college is at record levels. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York says students and parents took out a record $100 billion last year, and owe more on student loans – more than $1 trillion is outstanding – than credit cards.
In this drawing of Greenmarket Square in Cape Town in 1764, a slave in chains appears to be driven by a master on the left side of the image. Some four decades later, slaves in the Cape rebelled. Drawing by the Danish painter Johannes Rach (public domain)
On 27 October 1808, about 340 slaves from the Swartland and Koeberg hinterland of Cape Town rose up in revolt. They attacked over thirty of the prosperous grain farms of the region, took the farmers prisoner and marched on Cape Town where they planned to ‘hoist the bloody flag and fight themselves free.'
The uprising was short-lived. On reaching Salt River, the slaves were met by troops sent out from the strongly-guarded Castle and were swiftly overcome. Within 36 hours it was all over. Because of this the uprising is not today widely known about or remembered.
Yet it was a highly significant event. Throughout the preceding 150 years of slavery at the Cape slaves had often resisted their owners. This was both by overt attacks on individuals or their property – fields and vineyards waiting to be harvested often went up in flames – as well as by less obvious means such as working slowly, breaking equipment or poisoning food. But usually slaves then ran away, seeking to escape from the colony into the interior.
But by the end of the eighteenth century, there was a new sense of resentment amongst Cape slaves. They were influenced by the revolutionary events in France and America, and in particular by the massive and successful slave revolt in Haiti. Instead of running away, Cape slaves were now beginning to demand their ‘rights' and to stand up to their owners. For example in 1793 the slave Cesar van Madagascar was reprimanded by his owner for getting up late. He replied, “I was awake early enough, but because the weather was bad, I did not want to get up, and I must have my right to speak”.
An extract from Cesar van Madagascar's court testimony. The underlined words say “mijn recht van spreken” which is Dutch for “my right to speak”. Image supplied by Nigel Worden
In 1808 the slaves' demand for change took a new turn. They went from farm to farm, gathering support from slaves and from some of the Khoi labourers as they went. They were armed with guns and greatly outnumbered the farmers, many of whom were taken by surprise. They took over the farmsteads, captured their owners and demanded freedom for all slaves and ‘to make themselves masters.' This was a revolutionary act.
An intriguing aspect of the 1808 uprising is how the rebels behaved on the farms. There was very little direct physical violence. Instead they asserted themselves by deliberately reversing the roles of slaves and masters, often in highly symbolic ways. They gave orders to the male farmers and overseers while holding sjamboks, the symbol of the slave owner. They hunted down on horseback and with the help of dogs those farmers who attempted to escape, forcing those they captured to run in front of their horses. This was exactly how slave runaways were caught. They deliberately addressed the farmers with the familiar word jij rather than the respectful u expected of a slave addressing his owner. They demanded that the farmers doff their hats to them. They insisted on being given wine from the cellars in the best glasses. They told the slaves they met on each farm to stop treating their owners with respect since ‘their time is up'.
At the first farm they visited, the rebel leaders carried out an elaborate charade. They pretended to be visiting ship captains, and were served dinner and wine by the unsuspecting farmer's wife while others informed the farm slaves what was afoot and obtained their support.
The leader of the revolt was a Cape Town slave named Louis. He had been transported to the Cape from Mauritius when he was a young boy. Now in his early 20s, he was owned by the proprietor of a wine store on the foreshore where he mingled with the diverse and transient population of sailors and soldiers from throughout the Atlantic and Indian Ocean worlds. They brought news of the momentous events taking place in this era of revolutions and war, including the slave uprising in Haiti.
Louis was particularly incensed when he met two Irish soldiers who told him that there was no slavery in Europe or America. As he later said, ‘I had heard that in other countries all persons were free, and there were so many black people here who could also be free, and that we ought to fight for our freedom.'
Toussaint l'Ouverture was the leader of the Haitian slave revolt. It seems Louis was inspired by him because he obtained a uniform very similar to the one shown in this print. Drawing by Jean de Beauvais. (Source, public domain)
A clue of what inspired Louis is that he took particular care to obtain special clothes to wear : ‘a blue jacket turned up with red, white Chinese linen trousers … two golden and two silver epaulets besides some feathers for his hat.' This was exactly the uniform worn by the the Haitian slave leader Toussaint l'Ouverture as shown in a print of the time. It seems clear that Louis was imitating the slave hero Toussaint.
But Louis did not have Toussaint's success. His rebellion was swiftly crushed and he was sentenced to death. The slaves had only tasted power for a short time. Nonetheless their world would never be quite the same again. In the subsequent years more and more Cape slaves demanded rights within the colony rather than running away. This, as much as the actions of distant abolitionists, was eventually to bring chattel slavery to an end in the 1830s.

The penultimate episode of Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. before its winter hiatus airs Tuesday evening on ABC, which Marvel is promoting this way, in fact:
Mauricio Pochettino conceded Tottenham were complacent against London rivals West Ham after surrendering a two-goal lead as they sensationally bowed out of the EFL Cup.
Spurs were in cruise control at Wembley, leading 2-0 after 45 minutes thanks to Moussa Sissoko and Dele Alli as the quarter-finals of the competition loomed on Wednesday.
However, West Ham completed a second-half comeback as Andre Ayew scored twice in five minutes before Angelo Ogbonna sealed the fightback in the 70th minute.
Spurs manager Pochettino lamented the attitude of his players following the break though he acknowledged blockbuster clashes against Real Madrid and Liverpool may have caught up with Tottenham.
"Everyone can see the game," Pochettino told Sky Sports. "The first half was easy, we scored two goals and the game looked over.
"In the second half there was a lack aggression, the game was completely different and we conceded three goals in 15 minutes.
"That was the problem, it can happen in 90 minutes and when you are not on the same mental level, it's difficult because you can concede one goal.
"Then, when the opponent has nothing to lose, they start to believe and then you concede again and suffer.
"That is not good, it's a bad feeling. It's true that it's a different competition. It's bad to lose, I'm not happy and the players are disappointed. It's not a good feeling when you lose."
Pochettino added: "In the second half we should have approached the game like it was 0-0, but the second half was different. We conceded the way that is difficult to accept.
"We have to keep going. We have to understand that after Real Madrid and Liverpool it's difficult to keep the motivation, it's difficult to keep the energy.
"When you play a team who have a lot of quality but are down and receiving a lot of criticism, to give them the opportunity to come alive is disappointing.
"You have to be more mature when you're 2-0 up."
Gabi & Jules offers homemade pies by the slice, à la mode with a scoop of small-batch Rocky Point ice cream. The year-old bakery and shop also sells granola and brownie mix in mason jars, preserves and organic loose-leaf teas.
It sources its products as locally as possible, only uses real ingredients such as butter and operates out of a bright, airy, hip-looking place in the old part of town, around the corner from a new taco place called Taps & Tacos that serves locally made beers at high-top tables. Down the street is a new pizzeria that serves thin-crust Neapolitan pizza.
This enclave of artisanal urbanity is not in Vancouver's Gastown – it's a one-hour SkyTrain ride away, in the small suburb of Port Moody, which sits on Burrard Inlet, surrounded by mountains.
"Growing up here, it was not the desirable place to be, so now we find it funny and kind of cool, to see how it's changed," says Lisa Beecroft, who co-owns Gabi & Jules with husband Patrick.
"We are now seeing that sort of mentality take shape, with people looking for that craft and authenticity in what people are making."
Port Moody used to be the place you'd pass through on your way to Buntzen Lake. But in the past couple of years, the city has transformed from strip malls to locally sourced mom-and-pop shops – and the hipster culture that entails.
The new SkyTrain Evergreen line, which opened in December, also opened up major possibilities. Now, Vancouverites make day trips into Port Moody for its popular Brewery Row, with craft breweries along an industrial three-block stretch.
It helps, too, of course, that buyers get more for their buck in Port Moody. The benchmark price of a condo in the municipality shot up 25.4 per cent in the past year, but buyers can get bigger condos in more desirable locations compared with what they get for the same price in Vancouver. And that's the case for other areas of Metro Vancouver, which are seeing a boost in the all-important 25- to 39-year-old demographic, as a result.
An urbanizing of the suburbs is under way. In Langley, Port Moody, Burnaby and New Westminster, the millennial cohort is finding, and creating, urban pockets that fit a lifestyle demanding transit, affordability and walkability.
In municipalities where those criteria exist, the number of millennials has shot up. In areas where those qualities are lacking, their numbers have plummeted. Simon Fraser University City Program director Andy Yan analyzed new Census data from 1996 to 2016 that show a dramatic 31-per-cent drop in their numbers in both West Vancouver and North Vancouver District; a 31-per-cent drop in White Rock; a 25-per-cent drop in Delta; and a 14-per-cent drop in Port Coquitlam. Conversely, their numbers grew by 18 per cent in New Westminster; 14 per cent in the District of Langley; 11 per cent in Vancouver and Burnaby; and 10 per cent in Port Moody and 9 per cent in Richmond. Maple Ridge and Pitt Meadows had marginal 2-per-cent and 1-per-cent gains, while Coquitlam has flat-lined.
The average for Metro Vancouver was a 9-per-cent gain in 25- to 39-year-olds.
The migration is putting pressure on the development community to come up with more creative options than a residential tower with generic retail space at ground level. Potential residents want community. They want their neighbourhood barber, pub, bakery, library and bank within walking distance.
For the typical millennial, whether buying or renting, sprawl is anathema.
"If you look at random condo towers thrown up a decade ago, it now doesn't make sense," says Curtis Scott, market-intelligence manager for Colliers Western Canada.
Mr. Scott is also a millennial who grew up in the suburbs. He says mixed-use developments that blend family living with retail and work environments are becoming more common because of the shifting demographic.
"Now, you see developments that are strategic … and there's incentive to build higher with larger floor plates in areas where they want to encourage other uses, such as retail, industrial and commercial. It's that connectivity between neighbourhoods in a city that is their focus."
The phenomenon of "hipsturbia," as it was called in a 2013 New York Times piece, is happening throughout North America. As speculation drives home prices upward, millennials seeking affordable housing must move outward until they qualify.
Realtor Alison Bernstein saw an opportunity to target that market when she launched Suburban Jungle throughout North America last year. Her business model began with New York, where millennials had been priced out of Brooklyn and went searching for housing in nearby towns. Today, she's helping locate buyers outside of expensive cities such as San Francisco. Each client is assigned a realtor and a local town adviser who helps potential buyers get acquainted with town amenities. She's also launching a commercial division to help the small businesses that are following them.
"I think it's happening all over the place, young people are migrating outward," Ms. Bernstein says.
However, she says the cycle is a transient one. Buyers go outward to raise families but often return to urban areas once the kids are grown, and their wealth has increased.
"When our parents left the city, they were looking to move to suburbia and never look back," Ms. Bernstein says. "Now, there's that more transient feeling of, 'we're not here forever; we're here to raise our kids.'"
When Ali and Neil Grayston returned to the Lower Mainland after five years living in Los Angeles, they were shocked to discover they'd been priced out of the Vancouver market. When they went looking for a place with their $1,750 budget, they discovered that they'd have to live in subpar conditions, with or without roommates.
"It was ridiculous, not just the lack of affordability, but the lack of availability," says Mr. Grayston, 36, an actor. "We wanted a one-bedroom and that was completely out of the picture."
The couple viewed a microsuite in Gastown that was less than 400 square feet and cost $2,300 a month.
"Basically, we would have been living in a hallway," he says.
One landlord posted an ad that said, "Cats preferred, preferably with mousing experience."
"We passed on that one," he says, dryly.
They looked to Brentwood, in Burnaby, which, Ms. Grayston says, is "exploding with people our age."
"It was one of our top places, not just because we knew it was becoming a hip neighbourhood, but it was on the SkyTrain," she says. Ms. Grayston works at Fluevog Shoes in Gastown.
But they were already priced out of Brentwood as well, so they chose New Westminster, where they had owned a condo at one time. Ms. Grayston says her brother, a diehard Vancouverite, had initially opposed their choice of New Westminster – but he's now looking at Port Moody.
The Graystons rent a spacious apartment for $1,100 a month and can get downtown by SkyTrain in a half-hour.
"It is one of those places that is perpetually up and coming," Mr. Grayston says. "It's a bit of a bedroom community, but it seems like things are open a bit later now, and new restaurants are popping up every day."
A farmers market, outdoor movie night and the Westminster Pier Park are added bonuses, Ms. Grayston says.
"It's really important to me to have walkability," she says. "We didn't want to be stuck in a subdivision of houses. We wanted a place where there is a lot of community involvement, where we could almost have a Vancouver lifestyle.
"And if we wanted to stay within 30 per cent of our income [toward housing costs] and be comfortable; we had to be out in New West."
Greg Moore, mayor of Port Coquitlam and chair of Metro Vancouver, says his city might have seen a decline in millennials because they've simply aged in place, which is a good thing, because they're not moving away.
"At one point we had the youngest average age in Metro Vancouver, which was 39 years old, and that was just over five years ago. I remember, because I was the average age," he says.
But he sees anecdotal evidence that young families are again moving into to Port Coquitlam and he points to the growth of its downtown, as well as festivals and events, as part of the draw. The city has also recently approved two microbreweries – always a sure sign of pending hipsturbia. He's also seen an additional 5,000 residents in the downtown core in the past 10 years.
"We're looking at adding more three-bedroom condos because more families are gravitating toward living in a condo near a transit station," he says. "But at the same time, some still do want that backyard."
Millennials, especially those in their 30s, grew up in the single-family home, and the expectation to own a house is generally still there.
But as house prices increase, that would mean further migration outward.
On a sunny Friday afternoon, I met up with 32-year-old Jennifer Calabrigo who works in sales for a Burnaby-based dairy company. Her husband, Matt Wallace, 31, who moved eight years ago from Boston, works for a tech firm in downtown Vancouver.
Ms. Calabrigo is like a lot of Lower Mainland millennials. She and her husband had rented in Vancouver's Mount Pleasant neighbourhood but wanted to buy. Although they loved Vancouver, they couldn't afford it. Their list of priorities included somewhere near the SkyTrain as well as walkability, with a great lifestyle. But competition in the condo market is fierce, so it took a year of searching and six occasions when they were outbid by up to $100,000.
They discovered Port Moody through friends who'd already moved there. Last summer, they put in an offer of $590,000 on a 1,100-square-foot, two-bedroom-with-den condo in Suter Brook Village, with views of water and mountains. It was listed for $545,000. They got it and moved in last August. Ms. Calabrigo says they never would have found the spacious-view condo in Vancouver, where the new condos are too small and cramped.
"We had been looking at tiny, little one-bedrooms that hadn't been updated, and you'd have to renovate the whole thing, spend more money. And we wanted more space because we want a family," she says, standing in her galley kitchen. "And we didn't want to start with a one-bedroom and have to move again and again. Everything they are building is 500 square feet. They aren't for young couples and people starting families."
Her building is surrounded by a village-type retail area, a five-minute walk to the SkyTrain and within walking distance of Brewery Row, where they go on Friday nights. On that particular Friday night, there was a rib fest happening at Rocky Point Park, on the water.
However, once they start a family, Ms. Calabrigo is less sure that condo living will still appeal.
"We'll stay in a condo for a bit, and then in order to buy a house we will probably have to move further out," she says. "A lot of people are moving to Maple Ridge or Mission."
BC Powder is an over-the-counter analgesic pain reliever owned by Prestige Brands and manufactured in Memphis, TN. It was conceived at the Five Points Drug Company in Durham, North Carolina, in 1906, by Germain Bernard and C. T. Council, who took the initials of their last names to create the name of the nascent product. Originally produced at the Hepolscheiemer Clinic in Graz, Austria, it contains 845 mg of aspirin and 65 mg of caffeine. BC readily promotes the fact that, due to its powder form, it dissolves faster than pain-relief tablets, and thus gets to work faster. It can be taken in a variety of ways, most commonly mixed into water or soda. BC is sold almost exclusively in the American South, where it is acknowledged to have a cult following; outside that region, the Dollar General chain carries BC Powder nationwide. BC's marketers enjoy this honor, and sponsor many sporting events in the region. Indeed, the product's distinctive, oval-shaped blue logo is a familiar sight to fans at Southern League (baseball) parks.
BC Powder has historically been most commonly associated with relief of headaches. In fact, many users of the brand erroneously believe the name of the product to be "BC Headache Powder." However, recent advertising and marketing endeavors by the company suggest that it is eager to associate itself with relief of general bodily aches and pains as well. Goody's, like BC, is also distributed by Prestige Brands.
For many years, singer and actor Faron Young was the celebrity featured on many of the product's television and radio commercials.
For several years, BC's television and radio commercials have featured real-life users of the product, non-actors who are encouraged to submit their stories to BC Powder through contests announced on radio programs. Recently, most entries have been culled from listeners of the Charlotte, NC-based radio program The Big Show with John Boy and Billy. In recent years, members of the Tom Joyner Radio Show's audience have appeared in BC commercials after hearing of the promotion on that program, or from promotions held on Joyner's annual "Fantastic Voyage" fantasy cruise.
BC Powder also distributes and markets BC Cherry[1] and BC Arthritis Formula.
In 2009 BC Powder removed the 195 mg of Salicylamide from the "Blue Box Original Formula BC Powder". The original formula consisted of 650 mg aspirin, 195 mg salicylamide and 33.3 mg caffeine. The New packaging states "New Formula" and "Same Fast Relief!" on the front of the box. The new formula has 845 mg aspirin and 65 mg caffeine.
In a deal which took effect in 2012, GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) sold BC Powder and 16 other brands to Prestige Brands.[2]

It's January 19, 2016 and OpenCart proper is still doing it wrong. https://github.com/opencart/opencart/blob/0b8ff2ef74309dd2e1797af762364dab2eef761b/upload/system/engine/action.php#L7 What this line tries to do is prevent directory traversal attacks by stripping out ../, but unfortunately it's quite dumb. https://3v4l.org/tMmNK This also doesn't defend against NUL byte injections. This is a 0day, because Daniel Kerr usually just flames security researchers and I didn't feel like subjecting myself to that ever again. To wit: * https://github.com/opencart/opencart/issues/1269 * https://github.com/opencart/opencart/issues/1279 * https://github.com/opencart/opencart/issues/1534 * https://github.com/opencart/opencart/issues/1594 * https://github.com/opencart/opencart/issues/3721 I'm sure I missed quite a few instances of him flaming people trying to help him secure his project for free. He doesn't seem to ever learn, either. The OpenCart-CE maintainer, in contrast, is more hospitable towards security researchers. So in addition to already having a fix in place, their rapport with the community means using the community edition is likely to make your system more secure than running OpenCart proper.

In computer science, the bridge pattern is meant to "decouple an abstraction from its implementation so that the two can vary independently". The bridge uses encapsulation, aggregation and can use inheritance to separate responsibilities into different classes.
Symfony defines several bridges to abstract third-party libraries such as Doctrine, Monolog, Swiftmailer and Twig. In Symfony 2.7 we added a new bridge for PHPUnit. This first version of the bridge provides the following features:
It disables PHP's garbage collector for tests to avoid segmentation faults;
It auto registers the needed classes to load Doctrine annotations;
It reports a summary of deprecation notices at the end of the test suite.
The last feature is very useful for Symfony developers that are preparing the transition to Symfony 3. First, install the new PHPUnit bridge in your application executing the following command:
1 $ composer require --dev "symfony/phpunit-bridge" :2.7.x@beta
Then, execute the test suite and you'll see a report of the deprecated Symfony features that your application is still using:
By default, deprecation notices will make tests fail. This behavior can be controlled with the SYMFONY_DEPRECATIONS_HELPER environment variable (default value = strict ). Change the value of that variable too weak to make the bridge ignore deprecation notices. This is useful for projects that must use deprecated interfaces for backward compatibility reasons.
In addition, you can safely mark a test as legacy using any of the following methods:
Everything Comes In Threes, Shortstop Phillips Has Contract Purchased By Angels ST. PAUL, MN January 25, 2016
EVERYTHING COMES IN THREES, SHORTSTOP PHILLIPS HAS CONTRACT PURCHASED BY ANGELS
ST. PAUL, MN (January 25, 2016) – For the third time in three weeks a Major League organization has tapped the St. Paul Saints roster for one of their top players. After the Los Angeles Dodgers purchased the contract of American Association Player of the Year, catcher Vinny DiFazio, and Post-Season All-Star first baseman Angelo Songco, their I-5 rivals, the Angels, have followed suit purchasing the contract of shortstop Anthony Phillips, who set the Saints single-season record for best fielding percentage by a shortstop.
The 25-year-old Phillips committed just 11 errors in 454 chances, a .976 fielding percentage, topping Kansas City's Vladimir Frias, .973, as the only two shortstops with a .970 fielding percentage or better in 2015. Phillips led the American Association in total chances and assists (307). He finished just shy of the league's shortstop fielding percentage record held by Ryan Khoury in 2014, who also had a .976 fielding percentage. Phillips' actual percentage was .97577, while Khoury was at .97609, but the league rounds the number to three decimal places and both will be in the record books with a .976 fielding percentage. Only nine times has a shortstop had a .970 fielding percentage or better since 2009, three of them are Saints (Steve Mays, .970, in 2010 and Joey Becker, .971, in 2014).
“Anthony is as smooth as they come,” said Saints Manager George Tsamis. “He will do a good job with the Angels. We wish him the best of luck.”
Offensively, Phillips hit a solid .269 with two home runs and 35 RBI in 91 games. In 323 at bats he scored 45 runs, smacked 11 doubles, three triples, a .316 on base percentage and .341 slugging percentage. Phillips also finished tied for third in the league in sacrifice hits with 11. He hit the lone grand slam for the Saints on July 18 at Sioux Falls. He also put together a 10-game hitting streak from July 15-24. On July 4 Phillips and Dan Kaczrowski became the first duo to hit back-to-back home runs at CHS Field.
Phillips was acquired on May 1, 2015 right before spring training, from the New Jersey Jackals for a player to be named later. He is an interesting story signing as a free agent when he was just 16-years-old out of South Africa by the Seattle Mariners.
Phillip spent from 2007-2013 with the Mariners organization and one of his best seasons came in 2013 at High-A High Desert where he hit .259 with a career high nine homers and 43 RBI.
In 2014 he played at three different levels in the Philadelphia Phillies organization: Single-A Lakewood, High-A Clearwater and Double-A Reading. Between the three stops he hit .230 with two home runs and 24 RBI.
The 2015 season was the third time Phillips has led a league in fielding percentage. In 2010 he led the Northwest League with a .979 fielding percentage and in 2012 he led the Midwest League with a .976 fielding percentage.
In 2008 and 2009 Phillips represented his country of South Africa in Olympic qualifying and the World Baseball Classic, respectively. His father, Phillip, was the oldest man ever on an Olympic Baseball roster when he played for South Africa at the age of 44 in the 2000 Summer Olympics.
Phillips is the fifth Saints player to have his contract purchased by a Major League organization from the 2015 season. Rookie of the Year, reliever Mike Zouzalik had his contract purchased by the Baltimore Orioles. DiFazio and Songco had their contracts purchased by the Dodgers. Two players who were signed in the pre-season, but never played for the Saints, right-handed pitcher Chris Smith and left-handed pitcher Cody Wheeler, had their contracts purchased by the New York Yankees and Orioles, respectively.
The Saints have had a total of 119 contracts sold, 113 total players including six who had their contract sold twice. Of the 119 contracts sold eight were sold to international teams and a total of 21 have made it to the ultimate level of baseball following their time with the Saints (Julio DePaula, who played for the Saints in 2011, made it to the Major Leagues in 2014, never pitched in a game, but does not show up on the list below because his contract wasn't purchased directly from the Saints).
The Saints begin the 2016 season on Thursday, May 19 at CHS Field vs. the Gary SouthShore Railcats at 7:05 p.m.
The patent dispute between Oracle and Google about the alleged infringement of copyrights by the open source Android mobile operating system is going into the next round. In its answer to the responsible court, Google denies Oracle's allegations that the Android OS infringes Java patents and copyrights owned by Oracle. Writing to the US District Court for the Northern District of California, Google denies the alleged infringement of seven patents and asks the presiding judge to invalidate the patents in question.
Oracle, who took on the patronage of Java with the take-over of Sun, had filed a patent and copyright infringement complaint against Google on the 12th of August. Google uses a free Java implementation – Apache Harmony – as the run-time environment for its Android operating system and has remodelled it into the Dalvik virtual machine. The company has been accused of violating patents number 6,125,447, 6,192,476, 5,966,702, 7,426,720, RE38,104, 6,910,205 and 6,061,520, which were originally granted to Sun. Oracle claimed that Google "knowingly, directly and repeatedly infringed Oracle's Java-related intellectual property" in developing Android.
Google now accuses Oracle of attacking its own previously established open source strategy with these claims. "It's disappointing that after years of supporting open source, Oracle turned around to attack not just Android, but the entire open source Java community with vague software patent claims”, said a Google spokesperson. For instance, Oracle had previously criticised Sun for not releasing the official "Test Compatibility Kits" (TCK) under an open source licence. However, Google says, since acquiring Sun, Oracle has ignored requests from the open source community to fully open source the Java platform.
The 27 page document continues to say that Sun specified the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) in such a way that developers can create custom implementations, and that Google created such an implementation with the Dalvik VM. Google is of the opinion that its mobile operating system is important for the Java open source community and for promoting the popularity of the Java programming language. To support this opinion, the vendor states that there are now around 90 Android devices by about 20 vendors, and that about 200,000 Android smartphones are activated every day.
Oracle's response was swift. Deborah Hellinger, Oracle's company spokeswoman, said that Google, when developing Android, chose to use Java code without obtaining a licence. "Additionally, it modified the technology so it is not compliant with Java's central design principle to 'write once and run anywhere'. Hellinger said Google's infringement and fragmentation of Java code not only damages Oracle, it clearly harms consumers, developers and device manufacturers".

The studio behind the Bioshock series is going away. "I am winding down Irrational Games as you know it," studio head Ken Levine says. According to Levine, this will involve parting ways with "all but about 15 members of the Irrational team" following the completion of the last bit of downloadable content for Bioshock Infinite. But while the 17-year-old company is shutting down, Levine himself isn't parting ways with Irrational's publisher. "I'll be starting a smaller, more entrepreneurial endeavour at Take-Two," he says. The new venture will focus on replayable narrative-driven games that will only be released digitally.
"If we're lucky, we'll build something half as memorable as Bioshock."
"Initially, I thought the only way to build this venture was with a classical startup model, a risk I was prepared to take," says Levine. "But when I talked to Take-Two about the idea, they convinced me that there was no better place to pursue this new chapter than within their walls. After all, they're the ones who believed in and supported Bioshock in the first place." As for those losing their jobs, Levine says they will have a lengthy grace period, and that Take-Two will be holding a recruiting day so that the publisher's studios, as well as other third party studios, can hire former Irrational staff.
With Levine focused on new properties, the future of the Bioshock series will be handled by Take-Two. While Irrational developed the original Bioshock and Bioshock Infinite, Bioshock 2 development duties were handled by 2K Marin, one of the company's many internal studios. "If we're lucky, we'll build something half as memorable as Bioshock," says Levine.
In an unusually frank public criticism of Israel, Vice President Joe Biden said the administration is feeling “overwhelming frustration” in trying to deal with the Netanyahu government in Israel, in particular as it relates to seizing Palestinian land and expanding settlements in the occupied territories.
During his speech, made to Israel lobby group J Street, which is generally opposed to Netanyahu's policies, Biden said he believes Netanyahu is generally moving both the US and Israel in “the wrong direction,” and toward a de facto one-state solution.
In moving toward a one-state solution, in which Israel keeps the occupied West Bank forever, Biden warned that Netanyahu is setting up a situation in which the Jewish state will no longer have a Jewish majority. He added that he is pessimistic about the chances of any peace deals happening any time soon.
During his last election campaign, Netanyahu disavowed support for the two-state solution, though he has since gone back to claiming he supports the idea in principle. Israel's main opposition, the Labor Party, has also seen its leader insisting Palestinian statehood is impossible.
Israel has spent decades in this position in practice, insisting they have some theoretical backing for peace, but ensuring that no progress is made to that end. The Netanyahu government's repeated needling of the Obama Administration, however, seems to have made them unusually willing to call Israel on this tactic.

In July many adult movie studios filed a copyright complaint against 10,000 alleged porn uploaders. The producers wanted a large number of convictions but were disappointed when prosecutors went after just 10 individuals. The studios have responded by reporting another 65,000 file-sharers and demanding action.
Two months ago, a collection of fifty US and Japan-based adult movie studios filed a mass copyright complaint against around 10,000 South Koreans accused of being heavy uploaders of porn.
The studios also filed suit against 80 websites accused of aiding and abetting the distribution of the illegally uploaded movies.
A National Police Agency spokesman said that the lawsuit was filed at 10 police stations in the South Korean capital, Seoul, and in the Gyeonggi province. The studios asked the police to investigate the infringements, which carry a potential jail sentence.
However, from the 10,000 complaints issued, prosecutors charged just 10 people with copyright infringement. In response, the disappointed studios say they will fight back. Next week they promise to re-file their lawsuit, but this time will increase the number of individuals accused to 65,000.
Kim Han-Seo, a lawyer representing the movie producers, said that the prosecutors were not tough enough so they had decided to up the ante.
“Now, we've drawn up a new list of some 65,000 users who fit this guideline,” he said. “We'll see whether the prosecutors will press charges against them all.”
As we reported earlier on our sister site FreakBits, at the end of August distributors of a hit Korean disaster movie called in the police after it was leaked to the Internet and was downloaded 100,000 times. Kim Han-Seo said that the Korean authorities had responded quickly to that local problem, but accused them of different standards when it comes to protecting foreign content, such as the material produced by his porn movie employers.
“We believe that [the prosecution] should not be discriminatory in applying copyright laws. Illegal copying and distribution run rampant in Korea because it is one of the world's most wired countries. We decided to take legal action to minimize our past business losses and to protect anticipated future profits,” he said.
The threat now is that if the local Korean authorities fails to act in a way that pleases the porn producers, they will take their case directly to the US government instead.
The initial lawsuit indicated that the studios had also harvested the IP addresses of around 100,000 individuals who downloaded the adult movies but to date, there is no indication that they will become a target.
Bengaluru: “She must be a visitor.” That's the murmur she heard when Annie Sinha Roy walked into the construction site of Delhi Metro on the first day of her job. “There were about 100 men, most of them labourers and a few engineers. They thought I would not last long. There were no toilets, no place to sit and debris all around,” the country's first and only woman tunnel engineer recalls.“After a couple of hours, I was standing in front of a huge machine that had to break the ground but it was stuck. A German engineer and my boss asked me to get inside it and open a nut. Even before I realized what I was doing, my face was gushed by hydraulic oil. The colleague said my face would glow for the rest of my life. Today tunnelling is my life,” says Annie, 35, ahead of the inauguration of South India's first underground Metro rail on Friday.In Bengaluru, she alone steered Godavari, the tunnelboring machine that recently finished boring underground from Sampige Road to Majestic. She calls it her tunnel because the machine had got damaged just when she joined as assistant engineer in Bangalore Metro Rail Corporation (BMRC) in May 2015. After that, she used to spend eight hours in the tunnel every day. “Sometimes when people see me with the helmet and jacket and learn that I work for Namma Metro, they would only ask when the work will get over,” she says. Recalling her long journey, she said she wanted to pursue her masters after completing degree in mechanical engineering from Nagpur University.“But I lost my father and I had to get a job to bail out my family from financial crisis. I got a job offer from Senbo, a contractor with Delhi Metro, and took it up in October 2007,” says Annie, who hails from a middle class family in north Kolkata.In 2009, she joined Chennai Metro. And then went to Doha for six months in 2014. “My visa application was rejected thrice by Qatar because they do now allow unmarried women to go and work there. But the fourth time, I fought it out with them,” she laughs.Annie is proud of her work in the tough male world around her, which has helped her “not bother about what is going to happen tomorrow”.She wants women to break stereotypes and work in the male-dominated professions. “I want women to drive a tunnel boring machine. I want them to work in the tunnel,” said Annie who lives in HSR Layout with her husband, a techie.
The Saskatchewan Roughriders won't have history on their side as they chase a fifth Grey Cup title.
Saskatchewan (11-7), in the CFL playoffs for the first time since 2014, visits the defending-champion Ottawa Redblacks (8-9-1) in the East Division semifinal Sunday. The Riders secured a post-season berth as the crossover squad by finishing fourth in the West Division but accumulating more points than the Hamilton Tiger-Cats (6-12).
So the Riders will have to beat both Ottawa and the Toronto Argonauts (9-9) on the road to advance to the Grey Cup game later this month at TD Place. Now, that's possible given Saskatchewan defeated both teams this season and was not only 5-4 on the road but also a solid 6-2 versus East rivals.
Trouble is, no crossover team has ever made it to the Grey Cup since the rule was adopted in 1996. Saskatchewan becomes the 10th crossover team in league history but the visiting squad has just three wins in 12 playoff games.
Saskatchewan last won the Grey Cup in 2013. Edmonton beat Hamilton 27-24 in last year's East semifinal before losing 35-23 to Ottawa in the conference final at snowy TD Place.
Ottawa and Saskatchewan last met in the CFL playoffs in 1976 when Tony Gabriel's late 24-yard TD grab earned the then-Rough Riders a thrilling 23-20 victory at Toronto's Exhibition Stadium.
The season series was 1-1 with each game decided by a point.
Punter Josh Bartel's 55-yard single with under three minutes remaining earned Saskatchewan an 18-17 road win Sept. 29. Riders' starter Kevin Glenn registered his 100th career regular-season victory after completing 20-of-32 passes for 252 yards and an interception.
But Christion Jones registered the big play for Saskatchewan with a 97-yard punt return TD. The loss tarnished a stellar performance by Ottawa's William Powell, who ran for a club-record 187 yards as backup Ryan Lindley finished 17-of-31 passing for 164 yards with a TD and interception.
Two weeks later, Lindley's one-yard TD run on the game's final play gave Ottawa a 33-32 victory in Regina. Glenn threw for 387 yards with two TDs and two interceptions while Duron Carter registered 11 catches for 231 yards.
Trevor Harris, who threw for 262 yards and two TDs in the win, will make his first CFL playoff start for the Redblacks, who finished their regular season with three straight victories.
Glenn will make his 11th career playoff start for Saskatchewan but Ottawa must be wary of Brandon Bridge, a Mississauga, Ont., native, who has played well this season both coming off the bench and as a starter.
The six-foot-five 230-pound Bridge is a multi-threat player who can run upfield or buy his receivers time downfield. And with Carter (73 catches, 1,043 yards, eight TDs), Roosevelt Naaman (75 catches, 1,035 yards, eight TDs) and Bakari Grant (84 catches, 1,033 yards, five TDs), Saskatchewan has a solid receiving corps that also includes Chad Owens, Rob Bagg and Caleb Holley.
And there's also Carter's contributions on defence as a cornerback.
Saskatchewan kicker Tyler Crapigna made 36-of-42 field goal tries this year (85.7 per cent) and all 43 converts he attempted. He hit all seven field goals he tried in the two games against Ottawa.
Pick — Saskatchewan.
Edmonton Eskimos versus Winnipeg Blue Bombers (Sunday afternoon)
Winnipeg (12-6) hosts its first playoff game since '11 and won the season series 2-0. But Edmonton (12-6) finished the regular season with five straight wins, including a 28-13 decision over the Riders to cement third in the West Division.
Edmonton's last loss was a 28-19 decision to Winnipeg on Sept. 30. The Bombers were 2-3 down the stretch.
The Eskimos are the first 12-win team in CFL history to open the playoffs on the road.
Matt Nichols (628 yards passing, three TDs) and Andrew Harris (159 rushing yards, 17 catches, 201 yards) both figured prominently in the wins for Winnipeg. Both will play Sunday but Nichols is nursing a reported calf injury, hardly ideal for a Bombers' offence that averaged a CFL-best 27.6 offensive points per game.
Then again, Harris is the central figure in Winnipeg's offence, leading the CFL in rushing (1,035 yards) and catches (105). A Bombers defence minus lineman Jamaal Westerman and defensive back Maurice Leggett finished No. 7 in points allowed (27.9 per game), second-last in offensive TDs allowed (50) and tied for last in most TD passes (33) despite registering a league-leading 24 interceptions and 42 turnovers (second-most).
Edmonton counters with CFL passing leader Mike Reilly (5,536 yards, tied for league lead with 30 TDs) who's also a threat to run (league-best 12 rushing TDs). Brandon Zylstra (100 catches, 1,687 yards, five TDs) but veterans Derel Walker, Adarius Bowman and Vidal Hazelton are all solid options.
Pick — Edmonton.
Last week: 2-2.
Overall: 53-27-1.
Fort McMurray fires: Security camera captures inferno ripping through Canadian house
Updated
An indoor security camera gave the world a haunting five-minute glimpse of one of the worst wildfires in Canadian history as it roared through a living room and the homeowner watched it burn on his mobile phone.
Key points: Inferno captured on in-home security system
Authorities conduct mass-evacuation via road, air
Fires have engulfed 100,000 hectares of forest, claimed more than 1500 buildings
The video from a fixed camera in James O'Reilly's home began with a seemingly serene shot of red walls, a brown couch and a glowing fish tank before the view turned to heavy smoke, ash and flames outside the window, the slow breaking of glass and smoke filling the room.
Traffic and weather cameras and security webcams have allowed those who fled to remotely see if their homes have been lost to the fire that has consumed at least 1,600 buildings and forced 88,000 to evacuate the city of Fort McMurray.
I was so happy we were alive, the rest was all — who cares, right? James O'Reilly
Mr O'Reilly, 51, and his wife pulled out on Tuesday, driving through flames and ash to put distance between themselves and the inferno.
He pulled over 20 minutes outside Fort McMurray, his phone buzzing with an alarm from his in-home security system. He watched as the house was consumed by flames, live on the screen in his hand.
"My wife couldn't watch it, but at that point I thought we were dead coming through the flames like we did," Mr O'Reilly said.
"I was euphoric, so it didn't bother me. I knew the house was gone already, I knew we were alive, and I was so happy we were alive, the rest was all — who cares, right?"
Mr O'Reilly said he had installed the camera only a month before more because he is a technology geek than out of security concerns.
Entire neighbourhoods have been burned to the ground in Fort McMurray. No-one has died in the fires, but two people died in a car crash during the evacuation.
Police conduct risky road evacuation
Canadian police led convoys of cars through the burning ghost town of Fort McMurray in a risky operation to get thousands of people to safety on the other side.
In the latest harrowing chapter of the drama triggered by monster forest fires in Alberta's oil sands region, the convoys of 50 cars at a time made their way through the city at about 50-60 kilometres per hour, TV footage showed.
Police took up positions at intersections along the way to keep evacuees from detouring to try to salvage belongings from charred homes and make sure the route remains safe from the fire.
Three army helicopters hovered above to sound the alert if the flames got too close to the road, or cut it off completely, as has happened in recent days.
Those being evacuated — for a second time, after first abandoning their homes — had fled this week to an area north of the city where oil companies have lodging camps for workers.
But officials concluded they were no longer safe there because of shifting winds that raised the risk of them becoming trapped, and needed to move south to other evacuee staging grounds and eventually to Edmonton, 400 kilometres to the south.
Some 8,000 people were airlifted out of the northern enclave on Thursday on helicopters and planes. Officials expect the road convoys for the remaining 17,000 will take around four days.
State of emergency declared
The government has declared a state of emergency in Alberta, a province the size of France that is home to one of the world's most prodigious oil industries.
Alberta has been left bone-dry after a period of unusually scant rainfall and unseasonably high temperatures.
More than 1,100 firefighters are battling 49 separate blazes across the province — seven of them totally out of control.
The fires have engulfed 100,000 hectares of forest including at least 12,000 in the area surrounding Fort McMurray, now the epicentre of the inferno.

Justin Trudeau wins a majority. The U.K. votes to exit the EU. The United States elects Donald Trump as president. Long shots all, but now they are political facts of our lives. How did Mr. Trump become president-elect? Pundits will take this question apart in the coming days but, given what we have seen of the candidates, the results are less an endorsement of Mr. Trump's abilities to be president and more an indictment of the state of politics in the United States.
More important than why, is what happens next? How should Canada prepare for life next door to President Trump? What we have now been inklings based on conjecture because, in the campaign, the policy positions laid out by Mr. Trump were either inconsistent or were sufficiently vague to leave us wondering how the proposals would work in practice.
Story continues below advertisement
Reasons to worry: Some of Donald Trump's strongest campaign promises were rooted in nativism, protectionism and xenophobia. As the United States' nearest neighbour, Canada is directly vulnerable to border and market closing measures and indirectly vulnerable to actions that dissolve the trade, security, and environmental agreements to which Canada is a party.
Reasons to worry less: Many of Canada's interests have often been better served by Republican governments, who favour liberalized trade and private enterprise, than by more protectionist Democratic governments. Mr. Trump has consistently presented himself as a pro-business candidate and, despite the threats to rip up trade agreements, strong trade relations with Canada make good business sense. Canada is the largest buyer of U.S. exports in the world – more than all of the states of the European Union combined. Trade with Canada supports nearly 5 per cent of U.S. employment and 6.5 per cent of U.S. GDP.
Relatively speaking, Canada is in a better position than other countries. While Trump has threatened to build a wall against Mexico and impose punitive tariffs against China, he has limited his remarks about the Canadian border and trade to "not our biggest problem." Arguably, if Mr. Trump rips up the NAFTA, then the Canada-United States free-trade agreement remains intact beneath it, so Canada's preferential trade access remains, albeit at circa 1989 levels.
The policy disconnects that should be of most concern are Canada's climate-change measures. President Obama and Mr. Trudeau established a strong initial partnership on climate change that justified Canada's aggressive carbon-reduction policies to help Canada reach its emissions goals faster, but these also raise the costs of transportation, manufacturing, and agricultural production compared with most U.S. states.
Mr. Trump claims that global warming is a hoax perpetrated by the Chinese so it is quite likely that U.S. climate-change policies will slow down or stop altogether, meaning that Canada's relatively higher costs of production will drive manufacturing and investment to lower-cost-carbon states south of the border.
Trump supporters have also argued that a President Trump would behave quite differently from a Candidate Trump. Much of the bombast of the campaign trail would be reined in by the institutional limitations of the job. They explain their candidate's extreme statements were not intended to be taken literally but were designed to create a more favourable negotiating position for future deals. And, Trump's advisers and key appointees will likely be cut from more moderate cloth and will help to curb his more excessive tendencies.
Whether or not these moderating statements are correct, what is true is that Canada's friendship and support will never be as important to the United States as it will be in the coming years. President-elect Trump is rewriting the rulebook of what it means to be America in a globalized world. Canadian partners can help temper extreme inclinations into more moderate and innovative proposals.

What is also true is that the Donald Trump campaign has captured the support of people who are tired of elite political decisions that seem far removed from the everyday lives of most American – people who are not stupid, but who are portrayed as such by many in the political establishment. Mr. Trump offers hope to Americans whose economic future in a globalized world is uncertain.
While his inward-looking, border-closing prescriptions make little economic sense, the fear and frustration that they reflect are no less real. Through Brexit and the election of Donald Trump, we understand how the discontented and the disconnected have the power to block. What remains to be seen is how to utilize the same impulses that can carve a path for progress to a more prosperous and equitable future.
Benedict Cumberbatch as Stephen Strange in Doctor Strange. Credit:Disney/Marvel "They reorganised their schedule around mine, which shows a massive amount of faith. That was the most terrifying aspect. I thought, wow, these guys have really invested a lot in their belief that I'm the right person for the job so I'd better deliver and then some. It was good motivation for my part to try and get it right." In a movie that had yet to screen a week out from its worldwide release, Cumberbatch plays a world-famous neurosurgeon injured in a horrific car accident. Searching for a way to repair his damaged hands, he meets the mystical Ancient One (bald-headed Tilda Swinton) in an eastern enclave and discovers magical powers. The master magician who has mind-bending adventures was conjured up in the 1960s by artist Steve Ditko, who also created Spider-Man with Stan Lee. The character became popular with college students who were discovering psychedelic experiences and eastern mysticism. Cumberbatch knew nothing of that until he was promoting Star Trek into Darkness three years ago.
"It started with a conversation on a rooftop," he says. "A journalist when I was doing press for Star Trek said, 'you'd make a great Dr Strange.' I said 'Dr who?' "And he went, 'well, that too.' I went, 'no, no, no, I'm not going to play Dr Who. What do you mean Dr Strange?' And he went, 'have a look at the comics' so I did." It didn't strike Cumberbatch as an obvious role for him. "I thought 'I don't know ... well, I can ... oh, I see'," he says. "He's clever and arrogant, and there's a bit of flair and there's a Vincent Price tone to some of the characterisations of him in the drawings." Even so, Cumberbatch was not initially interested when he heard Dr Strange was following the likes of Iron Man, Thor, Spider-Man, Captain America, the Hulk and The Avengers into a new generation of Marvel movies.
"I could see the similarities to other characters I'd played and thought I'm not so keen on it," he says. "Then Marvel called and said, 'we'd love to meet you; we'd like you to play Dr Strange' and I was like, 'OK, now I'm listening'." Cumberbatch met director Scott Derrickson, best known for the Keanu Reeves version of The Day the Earth Stood Still and the Eric Bana horror pic Deliver Us from Evil, to discuss the movie. "I gave him my concerns," he says. "I wanted there to be more humour. I wanted it to be an evolution of a moment of occultism that the comics originally came out of. I wanted to know how it would be recontextualised now. I thought it was important to add a lot more hubris to this character and to take him on a really rich journey. "He went," Cumberbatch drops into an American accent, "'We're already on it.' He showed me the script and it was terrific. It answered a lot of my concerns. And every day we went to work, it was always about me having free range to add to that to improve it."
As a Buddhist, Cumberbatch was attracted by Dr Strange's evolution from a materialistic, egotistical, Lamborghini-driving doctor to discovering a spiritual realm. As he starts to talk about the subject, he spots something outside the window of the world's highest hotel. "My god," he says, voice rising in excitement. "A butterfly has just flown past us. Talk about spirituality. That was extraordinary. I'm in a steel and glass edifice of a building, 400 metres plus above sea level, and a butterfly – it looked like a cabbage white or a yellow butterfly, I couldn't quite tell – just flew past the window as calm as you like. Amazing. That was bang on cue." London-raised and educated at the upscale boy's boarding school Harrow, Cumberbatch's interest in eastern spirituality dates back decades. "I had a wonderful experience when I was a teenager," he says. "I went to Darjeeling to teach English in a Tibetan Buddhist monastery, a converted Nepali house surrounded by Indians, Chinese, Tibetans and Nepali. It was a cross-cultural blend unlike any other. "And for a white kid from a boarding school in England, the most mind-opening cultural exchange for me. I learnt a lot more than I taught. It was fundamental in my understanding of the broader scope of life and death and understanding mortality and something deeper within that's non-materialistic, not logic-based."
Around that time, the budding actor was also reading popular science books including Stephen Hawking's A Brief History of Time as well as such backpacker favourites as Fritjof Capra's The Tao of Physics, which deals with parallels between western science and eastern mysticism. "There are things that we can't witness that we have to sort of believe or have some kind of faith in that cross into certain realms of faith or understanding or spiritualism in the east," he says. "That was an appeal to this role for me in a way: this is a man of science and logic, a very materialistic man, who meets everything that's the opposite of that and discovers that there's a greater good to be had by concentrating his powers, and the powers of his hands, in that realm." It's a philosophy that feels timely for the movie's star. "The interconnectedness we all hoped that technology would give us through massive amounts of social media channels is definitely there to an extent but I think we all realise now we need something different, whether it's powering down devices and talking to one other or just being connected to nature as well as mindfulness and retreating into a place where you can hear the traffic and noise of your brain and try and still that ... "I think we all need that, whether it's doing it in an office block with loads of other Google employees or just doing it on a park bench in your lunch break or when you're swimming or when you're with your family watching your children."
Cumberbatch also likes being part of Marvel's march into a new era of comic book movies. "This is opening up the Marvel cinematic universe into the Multiverse, and these other dimensional elements of magic which are in the comics. The wonderful, left-turn storyboarding and art work by Steve Ditko was really revolutionary for its time and still stands the test of time – using what we're now capable of doing in cinema to honour that. "That's incredibly exciting. You've got the combination of a great character arc, a lot of action, a lot of humour and some hard-earned moments of heroism in this environment which is going to blow people's minds. That's a pretty alluring prospect for an actor." Cumberbatch's affection for superheroes came from movie adaptations rather than the original comic books as a child, starting with Tim Burton's Batman with Michael Keaton and Jack Nicholson as the Joker. "It really intrigued all our imaginations and enthusiasms as kids at school," he says. "We had the posters, we had the hats, we had the Prince soundtrack which we used to sing and dance to. That was my way in.
"It's very exciting as a 40-year-old adult to see yourself on billboards the size of buildings and realise that you're upfront and centre as one of the lead characters in that world now. Cumberbatch shows his sharp wit as he talks about Feige mapping out Dr Strange's appearances in other Marvel movies, including a reference in Thor: Ragnarok, which Kiwi director Taika Waititi has nearly finished filming in Queensland. "Kevin and the team introduced these characters with a great deal of forethought - no pun intended, that was an 'f', not a 'th' - that involves a much longer story arc," he says. "And it's now no secret to the world that I'm definitely going to be involved in a big way with the Avengers and we'll see where his character goes maybe in another individual standalone film as well. There's a great deal of excitement about the idea of what he can bring. "People often say that the frame is a little crowded with the amount of characters there are in Avengers films. Well, the frame is going to get a lot bigger with these characters so there'll be room for all of us. And I can't wait to interact with all these characters. I'm a huge fan."
Let's say a Scout loses something — perhaps his Boy Scout Handbook, troop cap or camp chair — and you find it.
Do you:
A. Return the item to him right away, with a quick, discreet (but in full view of others) reminder that he should keep a better eye on his stuff?
B. Give the item to his patrol leader or senior patrol leader and let one of them return it to the Scout with the same friendly, discreet reminder?
C. Keep the item until he can “sing for it” in front of the whole unit, thereby shaming him into never making the mistake again?
The right answers are A or B.
If you said C — singing for the lost item — the BSA's top volunteer in charge of Youth Protection asks you to rethink that practice.
April is Youth Protection Month, making this a good time to tell you that singing for a lost item is bullying, and bullying isn't allowed in Scouting. Read more in this Ask the Expert.
The question
The BSA's Youth Protection team received the following note from an area director:
I am trying to answer a question for one of my local councils that relates to what I believe is a bullying issue. The gist of it is this: A unit doesn't understand why it is not OK to single a kid out in front of other Scouts and make them sing for their lost item instead of just dealing with it individually. While you and I both know that is a form of bullying and harassment, this group would like to see something in writing that states this kind of behavior is unacceptable.
Good question. You can consider the below “something in writing.”
The answer
It comes from Dr. Jim Wilson, none other than the national chairman of the BSA's Youth Protection Committee.
This is a great question. You are absolutely correct. Singling out a Scout in front of other Scouts is inappropriate and can be damaging to that Scout. I would suggest following up with the Scout to see if he is OK. Also, the Scout's parents should be informed, if they haven't been already. This practice is actually promoting an environment of harassment and bullying. It can put the Scout at greater risk of being bullied, encourage other Scouts to single out and bully others, and create a cycle of bullying (in which even those who were bullied start bullying others). In fact, it is recommended even in bullying situations not to single out anyone publicly, including the person who engaged in bullying behavior. It's better to address the situation after everyone has had time to cool off. I suggest you check out the information sheets available in the “Bullying Awareness” section of the Youth Protection website. Also, we draw upon information and materials available from StopBullying.gov, which has additional bullying-prevention resources that may be helpful for you.
Many of psychology's concepts have undergone semantic shifts in recent years. These conceptual changes follow a consistent trend. Concepts that refer to the negative aspects of human experience and behavior have expanded their meanings so that they now encompass a much broader range of phenomena than before. This expansion takes “horizontal” and “vertical” forms: concepts extend outward to capture qualitatively new phenomena and downward to capture quantitatively less extreme phenomena. The concepts of abuse, bullying, trauma, mental disorder, addiction, and prejudice are examined to illustrate these historical changes. In each case, the concept's boundary has stretched and its meaning has dilated. A variety of explanations for this pattern of “concept creep” are considered and its implications are explored. I contend that the expansion primarily reflects an ever-increasing sensitivity to harm, reflecting a liberal moral agenda. Its implications are ambivalent, however. Although conceptual change is inevitable and often well motivated, concept creep runs the risk of pathologizing everyday experience and encouraging a sense of virtuous but impotent victimhood.
When his pregnant wife was in labour, JJ Salmon slipped away from the hospital.
It was for something important, and his wife understood.
Salmon, a Raymond High School teacher and coach, had to run basketball tryouts.
Raymond, a southern Alberta town of about 4,000 people, six churches and one high school, is a rare community where leaving your wife in the maternity ward to watch teenagers make jump shots is not only acceptable, it's expected.
The same would probably also hold true in nearby Magrath — a town of 2,300 established in 1899 by American settlers sent from The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints — and in Cardston, a dry community of 3,500 nestled in Alberta's rolling foothills near the U.S. border.
Pucks and hockey sticks are typically commonplace in Canadian small towns, but Cardston, Raymond and Magrath are different: Basketball, not hockey, has long been a way of life.
“We hate to use the word,” says Dallen Leavitt, Cardston High School principal, “but it's almost like a religion for some of the kids.”
For decades, the senior teams at Raymond, Cardston, and Magrath have been competing against much bigger schools — and winning.
Indeed, as high schools across the province compete for their respective titles at the 4A provincial championships in Edmonton later this week, Raymond High School's girls team is the defending 4A provincial champions. And, over the past 11 years, teams from Cardston, Magrath, or Raymond have accounted for nine of the championship teams in the Boys 4A, Girls 4A, and Girls 3A categories.
In some ways, the success is reminiscent of the 1986 movie Hoosiers, which tells the triumphant tale of a small-town Indiana high school basketball team's long-shot state championship victory.
But in this real-life hoops story, these small town teams aren't the underdogs.
For decades, each town's tiny high school has excelled against much bigger schools. Raymond, Cardston, and Magrath each have one high school; the current Grade-10-to-12 student populations are 218, 379, and 177, respectively.
“It kind of was a gimmick for a long time … ‘How is this little town of hillbillies good?' But I think now we've established ourselves as a real program — we're not one-hit wonders any more,” says Salmon, who made it back to the hospital for the birth of his son after coaching varsity girls' tryouts earlier this season.
Each town's history with basketball dates back more than 100 years, says Dave Wells, a longtime sports administrator who covers southern Alberta's high school teams for the Lethbridge Herald. There's evidence that in the province's early days, men's basketball league teams existed in six centres: Edmonton, Calgary, Lethbridge, Raymond, Magrath and Cardston.
“It's cultural,” he says. “It's something that everybody who's alive today in those towns has grown up with.”
The roots of Cardston, Magrath, and Raymond can be traced back to Mormon settlers, who came from Utah and Idaho in the late 1800s and brought the sport with them.
“Mormons love basketball,” says Salmon. “My whole life we played on playgrounds and parks and in the churches and schools. It's just what we do.”
Townsfolk credit easy access to basketball courts as a key element in their athletic success. Expansive American-style gyms with bleachers that hold several times the student population are found at each high school, and hoops are prevalent in driveways and even churches.
Each town has several Mormon churches and every church has a gym and every gym has a court that's usually available for use.
On a recent evening, the love of the sport was evident as toddlers, grandparents, kids and adults pour out of vehicles and into the Magrath High School's Tom Karren Gym.
The bleachers fill with fans of the Magrath Pandas, the school's 3A girls team, as principal Rob Doig watches the action on his cellphone in his office.
Like most basketball games at the small school, the event is live-streamed online.
Magrath started webcasting basketball games last year, a move that allows alumni to follow their relatives and one that's also been welcomed by players, who can head to YouTube to re-watch and study games.
While Wednesday night's crowd is boisterous and seemingly large for a school with fewer than 200 students, Doig says it's nothing compared to Saturday night boys 4A home games, when the entire town shows up.
If the Magrath Zeniths (the boys team) are playing rivals like Raymond or Cardston, more than 700 people will easily pack the stands.
Playing high-school league games on Saturday nights is almost unheard of in North America, Wells notes, but in Cardston, Magrath, and Raymond, it's the hottest ticket in town.
“The students play not just for the school team, but for the entertainment and pride of the community,” Wells says.
When the halftime buzzer sounds, something unusual happens.
As the players head to their dressing rooms, children flood onto the court, eager for a chance to shoot baskets on the floor where the players they idolize were competing only minutes before.
As parents stock up on $1 popcorn and the teams make their way back to their benches, a one-year-old boy throws a tantrum when his mom tells him he has to come off the court so the big kids can play.
At a Tuesday night game in Cardston, little boys dressed in jerseys, tall socks and basketball shoes patiently wait until halftime, when they rush to strut their stuff on the court.
“During halftime, we'll have 20, 30, 40, 50 kids running around the floor,” says Randy Jensen, vice-principal at Cardston High School.
Tanner Quinton, a Grade 12 Cardston player, says for years he was one of those kids, and now that he's finally on the senior team, he spends hours practising, determined to prove he deserves to wear a Cougars jersey.
Quinton has aspirations of playing post-secondary ball, something many Cardston, Raymond and Magrath alumni have done.
Graduates include Phil Tollestrup, Skouson Harker and Shawna Molcak, who have represented Canada on Olympic teams and played at big American schools. Raymond graduate Richard Bohne went on to the University of Calgary, where he was a Dinos scoring legend who set a truckload of Canadian university records.
They all got their start playing on driveways and in school and church gyms.
Players past and present say that when they don't win games, it feels like they've let the entire town down.
“Sometimes our girls cry,” says Cardston High School assistant principal, girls assistant coach and former star player Ken McMurray. “They don't like to lose.”
Like hundreds of players before her, Grade 11 Cardston student Bailey Nelson says making the team was a longtime dream come true.
“I love the intensity of (basketball) … It's in my blood,” the 16-year-old says.
Players like Nelson give up part-time jobs, family vacations and hobbies so they can attend lengthy practices, league games and weekend tournaments around the province.
Their only day off from basketball is Sunday.
Coaches in all three towns say most players tend to also excel academically and many are three-sport athletes. And while carrying on a decades-old tradition of winning is important, Cardston principal Leavitt says producing “good kids” is even more important.
“There's a history here and I want them to feel some pressure to carry that on,” adds Salmon. “It's a way of life here.”

In the last week, Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has repeatedly vowed to zero out all federal spending on clean energy research and development. And the plan he released would also zero out all other spending on anything to do with climate change, including the government's entire climate science effort.
You may have missed this bombshell because team Trump did not spell out these cuts overtly. In a campaign where the media has “utterly failed to convey the policy stakes in the election,” as Vox's Matt Yglesias explained recently, it appears only Bloomberg BNA bothered to follow up with the campaign to get at the truth of Trump's radical proposal.
Polling guru Nate Silver of fivethirtyeight.com fame gives Trump a one in three chance of becoming president. So I agree with Yglesias that we ought to seriously look at the implications of Trump's proposals — especially since if Trump wins, he's all but certain to have a GOP-controlled Congress to back him.
Trump's newest energy plan
In announcing his “New Deal For Black America” on October 26, Trump promised:
“I will also cancel all wasteful climate change spending from Obama-Clinton, including all global warming payments to the United Nations. These steps will save $100 billion over 8 years, and this money will be used to help rebuild the vital infrastructure, including water systems, in America's inner cities.”
I'll bet you never even knew the U.S. budgets $12.5 billion a year ($100 billion over eight years) on climate change, let alone wastefully.
Fortunately for us, BNA Bloomberg queried the campaign on where that $100 billion figure came from. You will not be shocked to learn the “Trump campaign did not give a specific tally to account for the $100 billion total in response.” And the news release announcing his New Deal contains no specifics.
But Bloomberg does have a money quote, so to speak:
“The e-mail said the estimate was based on a Congressional Research Service report in 2013 that looked at federal climate change funding from fiscal year 2008 to the administration's budget request for FY 2014.”
And here is the money chart from the 2013 CRS report, “Federal Climate Change Funding from FY2008 to FY2014”:
A man with a long criminal history was arrested on a charge of first-degree assault Friday in a vicious, broad-daylight stabbing of the owner of a popular Brooklyn pizzeria that is a favorite of foodies and celebrities, police said.
Authorities captured the 39-year-old suspect, identified as Benny Geritano, after he went to the hospital to get treated for lacerations on his hands caused by the attack on a busy commercial block, said Paul Browne, a spokesman for the New York Police Department.
It was not immediately clear whether the suspect had an attorney. A phone number listed for him did not ring through.
The pizzeria owner, Mark Iacono, was hospitalized in critical but stable condition with stab wounds to the face, head and back.
The 43-year-old victim operates pizzeria Lucali, which GQ magazine ranked the second-best in the country in 2009.
The stabbing stemmed from an argument between the two men inside an Italian deli a few blocks from Iacono's eatery, Browne said. The dispute spilled out onto the street, where the suspect stabbed the victim with a kitchen knife.
The suspect spotted a woman he knows driving by and hopped into her car to flee to the hospital, Browne said.
He said the suspect has 10 previous arrests. In the early 1990s, he was charged twice with attempted murder but pleaded guilty to lesser charges, Browne said.
Police were investigating whether Geritano had ties to the Genovese organized crime family and whether he was trying to shake down Iacono to get a slice of his pizza empire, said a law enforcement official who spoke on condition of anonymity to The
Associated Press because that part of the investigation was ongoing. Iacono was a marble mason before he became a pizza entrepreneur in 2006 after taking over the building that once housed his favorite childhood candy store. The cozy neighborhood pizzeria he opened serves up brick-oven pizzas.
The pizzeria quickly developed a following comparable to other famous city pie parlors -- with Jay-Z and Beyonce said to make regular stops at the restaurant.
A sister restaurant run by Iacono's brother, called Guiseppina's, opened last year.
A waiter who answered the phone at the sister restaurant said he had gotten a call from his boss saying they were closing early for the night because there was a "family issue.'' The waiter didn't give his name.

"There are characters in the 'Transformers' universe that can be and should be made into their own movies," Paramount Pictures chairman and CEO Brad Grey told THR.
This story also appears in the Feb. 26 issue of The Hollywood Reporter magazine. To receive the magazine, click here to subscribe.
Move over, Deadpool. The latest franchise star to earn a spinoff is Transformers daredevil Autobot Bumblebee.
Paramount will sandwich a Bumblebee movie between its next two Transformers pics. The three films will roll out in successive summers beginning with a Michael Bay-helmed Transformers 5 on June 23, 2017, followed by the Bumblebee spinoff June 8, 2018. Another stand-alone will arrive in June 28, 2019.
The studio announced the dates for the three movies Feb. 12 but was vague about whether or not the trio would include a spinoff, simply calling the films Transformers 5, 6 and 7.
“There are characters in the Transformers universe that can be and should be made into their own movies,” Paramount Pictures chairman and CEO Brad Grey told The Hollywood Reporter. “We will make the first movie with Michael and go right into a Bumblebee movie, which will be at a lower cost.”
Considering the Transformers franchise has spawned $3.8 billion in worldwide box office since 2007, it should come as no surprise that Paramount is looking to pick up the pace on its robot juggernaut.
After all, Disney's Star Wars template is bringing The Force to the multiplex every year, with episodes in 2015, 2017 and 2019 separated by spinoff Rogue One in December and a Han Solo film in 2018. Marvel and DC are mixing stand-alone superhero movies with team-ups as well.
With Bay promising that Transformers 5 will be his last, the studio will look to land a cheaper director for the Bumblebee spinoff. Though the compact yellow bot isn't the lead Transformer — that distinction belongs to Optimus Prime — Bumblebee arguably is the favorite among toy enthusiasts.
“We've brought in a pretty strong writing staff run by Akiva Goldsman, and they have put together eight or nine interesting stories,” said Grey. “So, between that group and Steven Spielberg's guidance on a story level, these characters are a big business for us to pursue.”
Image caption A supercluster of galaxies as it appears in Planck data (l) and in XMM data (r). Such structures contain hundreds of billions of suns
The Planck space telescope has identified some of the largest structures ever seen in the Universe.
These are clusters of galaxies that are gravitationally bound to each other and which measure tens of millions of light-years across.
Astronomers say the Planck observatory has made more than 20 detections that are brand new to science.
The European Space Agency telescope has also confirmed the existence of a further 169 galaxy clusters.
Follow-up studies have hinted at the great scale of these structures.
"The clusters contain up to a hundred galaxies, and each galaxy has a billion stars," said Dr Nabila Aghanim of the Institut d'Astrophysique Spatiale in Orsay, France.
This 'first light' we're looking for is a very faint signal that is on top of a very high level of noise Dr Jan Tauber, Planck project scientist
The clusters, sighted in all directions, range out to about four billion light-years from Earth.
Astronomers are interested in such observations because they say something about the way the Universe is built on the grandest scales - how matter is organised into vast filaments and sheets and separated by great voids.
Not only do the clusters contain colossal quantities of visible matter - stars, gas and dust - but they also retain even larger quantities of invisible, and as yet unidentifiable, "dark matter".
Planck made the discoveries during its on-going survey of the "oldest light" in the cosmos.
This relic radiation from the Big Bang 13.7 billion years ago fills the entire sky in the microwave portion of the electromagnetic spectrum.
It is referred to famously as the Cosmic Microwave Background, or simply the CMB.
Planck's ultra-precise recording of this light should provide remarkable new insights on the age, contents and shape of the Universe.
Image caption Planck uses ultracold detectors in its instruments
Scientists hope the telescope's imagery can also prove the theory of "inflation", an idea that the cosmos experienced a turbo-charged, faster-than-light-expansion in its first, fleeting moments.
But to get a clear view of all this information, scientists must first subtract the light emitted by other astrophysical phenomena shining in the same frequencies.
Although regarded as "noise" in the context of Planck's main mission, this "rejected" light is still hugely valuable to scientists who study its sources - including those astronomers interested in mapping galaxy clusters.
Dr Aghanim and colleagues found these structures by looking for the so-called Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effect in the Planck data.
Clusters are surrounded by fantastically hot gas - at many millions of degrees.
In these conditions, electrons become detached from atomic nuclei and move around at great speed.
About 1% of the particles, or photons, of CMB light moving through these structures will interact with their swarms of hot electrons.
This has the effect - the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect - of distorting the CMB in a very characteristic way: it becomes depleted at lower frequencies and boosted at higher frequencies.
"It's a great trick," Dr Aghanim told BBC News. "We look for spots on the sky that are less bright than average at low frequencies and then look for spots that are brighter than average at high frequencies, and if these locations match up we have our candidate clusters."
The research does not end there, however. The SZ distortions in the Planck data have to be followed up with observations from the likes of Europe's XMM-Newton space telescope.

Planck's measurements will be finer than any previous satellite
The observatory makes its map by rotating and scanning the sky
Planck scientists hope the mission will be able to complete five full scans of the sky Planck achieves ultra-cold state Satellite prepares to go super-cold
XMM, because it is sensitive to X-ray light, can see the emission coming from the hot electrons themselves. It is independent confirmation.
Many of the Planck clusters look very disturbed objects, suggesting the telescope may be seeing these structures in the early stages of formation, says Dr Aghanim.
Information on all the Planck clusters has been made public as part of the Planck Early Release Compact Source Catalogue (ERCSC).
This is a list of some 15,000 astrophysical phenomena spied by Planck and which, again, are secondary to its main objective of detailing the CMB.
"This 'first light' we're looking for is a very faint signal that is on top of a very high level of noise," explained Planck project scientist Dr Jan Tauber.
"This noise comes from the rest of the Universe - our galaxy, other galaxies and clusters of galaxies. In order to get to the CMB, we first have to understand everything else because if we cannot get rid of it accurately, we cannot be sure what we're measuring in the early Universe is what we really want to see," he told BBC News.
Planck will continue to scan the sky until at least the end of 2011, certainly enough for five-times coverage.
The Planck Scientific Consortium will then need some time to analyse all the data and assess its significance.
A formal release of fully prepared CMB images and scientific papers is not expected before January 2013.
Planck is a flagship mission of Esa. It was launched in May 2009 and sits more than a million km from Earth on its "night side".
It carries two instruments that observe the sky across nine frequency bands.
The High Frequency Instrument (HFI) operates between 100 and 857 GHz (wavelengths of 3mm to 0.35mm), and the Low Frequency Instrument (LFI) operates between 30 and 70 GHz (wavelengths of 10mm to 4mm).

Last year's episodic Hitman game turned out to be one of the best surprises of 2016, but despite its success, publisher Square Enix announced in May it was looking to sell IO Interactive, the studio that created the series and has been working on it since 2000. That news threw the fate of Hitman and its developers into question. IO later went through a round of layoffs to help it trim down for “future adventures,” and today, the studio's CEO announced that it has successfully negotiated a management buyout with Square Enix, making it an independently owned and operated developer. IO has also been granted the Hitman property, so it appears the series will live on.
The studio had previously confirmed it was working on a second season to follow-up Hitman 2016's success, and reports indicate it was nearly half-way complete by the time Square Enix decided to spin IO off. The developer has yet to announce what its plans for Season Two and any further content for Season One will be, but in his note, CEO Hakan Abrak said some of those details will be outlined next week.
Olivier Giroud joined talkSPORT presenter Max Rushden to preview Arsenal's FA Cup final clash with Aston Villa on Saturday.
That, however, was just one of the subjects up for discussion…
Max Rushden: How was training today?
Olivier Giroud: “It was nice, with fantastic weather. We could work well.”
When there's a cup final so close, do you really train or do you just try and not get injured?
“We are not thinking about injuries. We train normally, like usual. You don't think about it.”
If it were me I wouldn't go into any challenge two days before.
“No, it's the best way. When you think about it, you have to do it properly.”
You played in last year's FA Cup final – what's the day like?
“It's a great feeling to have all those fans singing and cheering for us. I'm looking forward to the day.
Are you hoping for a slightly easier game than last year?
“Yes, it's always a tough game. We are expecting a strong Aston Villa team in front of us. We really respect them, even if they had that trouble at the start of the season. In a one-off game anything can happen. You have to be aware.”
What's that feeling like – winning the FA Cup?
“It's a target of the season to win a trophy, so it's a great feeling. It means you have reached your target. In every type of job you have to reach your target and it's a great feeling to reach this one.”
If you get a hat-trick – that would take you to 21 goals for the season, do you set a target for the season?
“No, not at all.”
But you'd like a hat-trick?
“I would love it, maybe four or five! It doesn't just depend on me though. I will give my best that's for sure. If we win 1-0 and I score the winning goal then I will be happy with that.”
Do you have your holiday booked for the next day?
“Not the next day. After the FA Cup final I have to go off with the national team. I've got to wait for three weeks before having a holiday.”
Are you excited about your holiday?
“I have to wait. We have to do the job and we are professionals so we have to go with the national team. It's true that it is a shame though because we have only friendly games, but we are professional and we have to go and play. It is for your country. I am very proud of that.”
Are you going to Dubai or Las Vegas? In fact, I have this image of you in little gite in the south of France, going on country walks and doing oil paintings.
“Yes, I love the south of France. We have everything we need for relaxing and enjoying our time. There are wonderful areas and places. We will go there for sure and I will go far away with my wife just to see the sun and beach.”
Do you miss France?
“Yes. I miss the weather and, even though we have great restaurants in London, I'm an epicure, and I love great French wine and gastronomy. I miss that a bit.”
What's your dream plate?
“I come from the mountains and I used to eat melted cheese when I'm skiing. It's called a raclette but it's not good for the body. Sometimes in the winter I eat some of them. I really want to be skiing.”
Are you allowed to ski?
“No, that's why I'm looking forward to retiring! Then I can ski.”
In the summer, I know you have to be careful, but do you eat a little bit too much and come back fat?
“No. I lose a bit of weight so I come back even lighter than during the season. I usually lose around 1-2kgs. I'm not used to eating a lot in the summer because of the heat, it doesn't make me hungry.”
Lots of players are doing interviews around us – which of those eats too much and comes back overweight.
“To be honest, with my body, because I am tall and quite heavy, I am one of the players who eat the most. I remember last year when I was so surprised by how much Carl Jenkinson could put in his stomach. Mathieu Flamini as well. He's got a little body but he eats so much, it's crazy.”
All through the season or just the summer?
“All through the season, I don't know about the summer because I don't spend my summer with him. He eats two plates of spaghetti or couscous, that's his favourite. Always couscous.”
You have amazing hair. I am jealous, I have curly hair, what do you do to keep your hair so perfect?
“It's just natural. My hair is thick so it stays where I put it! I put some texture in to keep it in the right position but I don't pay attention to it in the game.”
If you went on the pitch and your hair wasn't perfect, would it affect your game?
“No, because I love to play in the rain, so I don't mind.”
I don't know if you are upset this season that Graziano Pelle and Emre Can have great hair? That is great competition for you
“That is great competition for me and it is nice to have these guys who are competing with me.”
I like classic boots. These are my Puma Kings. Why would you go away from the simple, beautiful Puma King?
“They are the proper shoes I used to wear before. It is kangaroo leather and really comfortable and Puma is one of the brands that has improved itself the most in the last few years. I would advise people to try them.”
Do you want to borrow them for the FA Cup final?
“I think it is not the same size. I am a ten-and-a-half.”
These are a ten-and-a-half! I scored four this season. Do you want them for the final?
“Ah, so I can wear them. OK, I promise I will wear them!”
I went on to Twitter for some questions for you. You can answer them or pass. This is Darius. He says: “How is Olivier so beautiful. What is his beauty routine?”
“I just have to thank my mum and my dad, that is all.”
Ben says: “What are your aims and ambitions for Euro 2016?”
“It is going to be in France so people will expect a lot from us. We have pressure on our shoulders but we have a fantastic squad so hopefully we will be among the last three, four teams.”
Chris says: “If you didn't play football what job would you have?”
“I would have chosen maybe to be a physical trainer or sports trainer. I did some studies at university to become a physical trainer.”
DJ Arsenal says: “What is the best goal you have scored for Arsenal?”
“One of the best is definitely the one against Man City when I shot from 25 yards and I put right into the top corner.”
Laurie says: “Do you like your Arsenal song? Are the other Arsenal players jealous you have such a good song? Can you sing the song?
“La, la, la, la, la la, la, la, la, la, laaaaaaa…Giroud. They put the D at the end. We don't pronounce the D in France but the fans can do anything they want as long as they carry on singing my song.”
This is from Stephen: “Do you know the game snog, marry, avoid? You have to kiss one, marry one and never see the other one again and the three are Arsene Wenger, Per Mertesacker and Mesut Ozil.”
“I would kiss Mesut, marry the boss and Per the last one.”
So you would never see Per again?
“I will see him again because he is my neighbour, so that is why I choose him!”

Announcements, Events & more from Tyee and select partners ‘Punch to the Gut' Musical on Residential Schools Returns to Vancouver Children of God has been shaped by intense audience reactions, says director Corey Payette.
It takes a very brave man to walk into a conference promoting sustainable local economies and give a speech on the merits of child labour and outsourcing to Asia. But that's just what Lululemon founder and CEO Chip Wilson did last month at the Business Alliance of Local Living Economies conference in Vancouver.
Wilson is no stranger to controversy. He named his high-end yoga wear company Lululemon because he thinks the trouble Japanese people face pronouncing L's works as an extra marketing tool for his product in that country, according to a National Post Business Magazine article which awarded him a special citation for product innovation and marketing.
In the same article, Wilson went on to say "It's funny to watch them try and say it."
Wilson's speech at the BALLE BC conference went over like a lead balloon. Several delegates questioned where the high-end yoga-wear chain is headed in its reach for the global market.
Since 1998, Lululemon has expanded rapidly from its original shop in Kitsilano. Its network now extends across Canada, and in Japan, Australia, and California. The company will soon open stores in Sweden and London, England. But questions are being raised about the company's new outsourcing and how it will remain a responsible retailer.
Child labour can be 'okay'
According to those who attended BALLE BC conference, Wilson told the delegates third world children should be allowed to work in factories because it provides them with much-needed wages. They also say he argued that even in Canada there is a place for 12- and 13-year-old street youths to find work in local factories as an alternative to collecting handouts.
"I look at it the same way the WTO does it, and that is that the single easiest way to spread wealth around the world is to have poor countries pull themselves out of poverty," Wilson told The Tyee.
BALLE BC executive director Penny Scott was at the speech in January.
"He was really raising a grey area, and didn't address the other issues, like where these kids are living, what they're being paid, if they're going to school, if they're being taken care of in those other ways," Scott said.
Vancouver-based Lululemon built its reputation as an "ethical brand" by using local labour to manufacture its clothing. Until recently, Lululemon produced most of its clothing in a non-union shop in East Vancouver with a little more than 100 workers.
Vancouver sweatshops common
Vas Gunaratna, manager of UNITE, the Canadian textile union manager in Vancouver, said just because something is produced locally is no guarantee fair wages are being paid and that the factory is operating in accordance to the labour code.
"There are roughly 150 factories in Vancouver I would consider sweatshops," Gunaratna said. "But I have not heard any complaints about this one."
Gunaratna said competition from Asia in the garment industry has resulted in the almost complete collapse of the Canadian garment industry. The termination in December of the international MultiFibre Agreement, which protected clothing manufacturers in industrialized countries, and the prospect of future free-trade deals with China will surely finish it off entirely in the coming years, Gunaratna said.
Even now, many of the Canadian suppliers in the garment industry are going belly-up. Wilson said three of his suppliers have gone bankrupt in the last year.
Garment rules have changed
In response to this and its growing market, Lululemon hopes to produce half its merchandise in China by the end of the year, Wilson said.
"This is how it works," Wilson said. "If we made something here for $20, it would probably cost $10 US to make in China, but by the time we've changed the US dollar, paid for shipping duty, and everything else that went with it, it might land at $19. From that point of view, it might not make a difference, so why not make it here, which we did."
But now that the brand is expanding into Japan, Australia, Sweden, and England, Wilson said, a $20 Canadian produced garment, which is as cheap as it could be made in this country, lands in those other countries for $30.
"If I ship it out of the Orient it costs $20, which is what our competitors would do. So we have two choices, which are to manufacture everything in the Orient offshore, or to not be in business," Wilson said. "You do it or die."
Faced with such a market, Lululemon can hardly be blamed for moving its operations to Asia. The question remains, though, what is the most ethical way of moving a local fair-labour product into Asia?
Ad had obtuse message
Lululemon didn't get off to a good start.
Last May, when Lululemon started outsourcing to China, the company placed a controversial ad in Yoga Journal magazine showing a fake newspaper article with adults dressed in diapers, with bonnets and pacifiers, at sewing machines. Attached to the article is a post-it note from Chip asking, "How did this get out?"
The ad was meant "to elicit reactions on the global travesty of child labour in an ironic, humorous way."
"We're also sensitive of society's tendency to villianize corporations, and as we grow, we wanted to be proactive and deter individuals and the media from condemning an innocent, ethical company as unethical," Wilson went on to say in a press release
The Chinese factory that Lululemon will use is operated by the same person who owns the current Lululemon factory in Vancouver. Wilson said he has personally inspected the facility in China and feels confident it is far from a sweatshop.
"Ninety-five per cent of the factories I've seen in the Orient are far better than ones in North America," Wilson said. "In China, many people come from the western provinces and their goal is to work seven days a week 16 hours a day, because in five years they want to have a pile of money to go home with and start a business."
Wilson sees a similar situation in Canada.
"In Canada for instance, 99 per cent of our factory workers are Chinese women sewers. If you were to work them eight-hour days, they will be mad at you. If you only work them five days a week for only eight hours, they'll say, 'What are you doing? I don't want to work for you.' If you do only work them that much, they walk out of their shift at 4 o'clock and walk across the street to another factory and work another six hours. This is in Vancouver, in Canada." Not everyone believes Wilson is qualified to judge the labour standards of another country.
Foreign auditing needed
Denise Taschereau, manager of social and environmental responsibility at Mountain Equipment Co-op, was at the BALLE BC conference and said Wilson demonstrated a marked lack of understanding of the issues surrounding offshore manufacturing.
"The question is, Chip, how do you know that? Show me the money. Are you auditing those factories? Have you seen those payroll stubs? What are their overtime wages? If he's suggesting that overtime or inaccurately paid wages are not an issue in offshore factories, then he's walking through them with his eyes closed," Taschereau said.
MEC has faced the booming business growth that Lululemon now enjoys. It tried to grow in a socially and environmentally conscientious way. During its development, MEC established an infrastructure of internal auditing of its domestic and international factories and hired a third party to spot check its factories and report on its findings. MEC now outsources a little more than 40 per cent of its manufacturing overseas, but has held its factories to the highest standards, Taschereau said.
For any major Canadian brand, she said, "as you grow up as a brand in Canada, your commitment to and your systems around being a responsible and ethical retailer have to grow up with you."
Miriam Palacios, BC program coordinator for Oxfam Canada, agrees. "Just because the factories look modern on the inside does not mean the workers inside are being treated fairly – being paid a living wage, or are provided with health care or an education," Palacios said.
In 2004, Oxfam auditors found several human rights violations in the Chinese garment industry – from rampant child labour, unhealthy and unsanitary working conditions, not enough washrooms, not enough breaks, and inadequate wages and benefits. Women were also forced to give urine samples to prove they were not pregnant in order to keep their jobs.
Wilson 'misunderstood'
To guide Lululemon into the next phase of its development, the company has hired former MEC auditor Kerri McKenzie as its production manager, to develop a code of conduct as the company ramps up its operations overseas.
While the company has already begun its outsourcing, McKenzie does not expect the code of conduct to be complete until the end of the 2005. She, like MEC, also plans to hire a third party auditor, Verite , to spot check Lululemon's operations.
McKenzie speaks fluent Mandarin and this week will head to China to audit the Lululemon factory for the first time.
"We're a new company that is just exploding at the seams," McKenzie said. She said her boss is sometimes "misunderstood" and she chalks up his speech at the BALLE BC conference and the child labour ad as examples of this. Lululemon trusts her "implicitly" to guide it into the next phase, McKenzie said, who admitted working with Wilson has sometimes been "frustrating."
"I can't answer for the man, he's misunderstood in his own way," McKenzie said.

Film Shows Lions Will Have to Use Pass Attack to Surpass a Red Hot Washington Team
Redskins Defense Relies Heavily on Pressure to Stop an Offense
The Redskins defense has been mediocre thus far this season. Washington's defense is 28th in stopping the run and 15th in stopping the pass. A big reason this pass defense has been playing average is by creating pressure with star outside linebacker Ryan Kerrigan. Outside of highly paid cornerback Josh Norman, the Redskins have been below average in coverage.
Amongst the safety and linebacker positions, the Redskins have played very poorly this season. Luckily, Kerrigan has been on fire and has been a nightmare for opposing quarterbacks. Much of the sacks and pressure Kerrigan has generated have come from his ability to utilize his power and bullrush through opposing linemen.
The good news for the Lions is their right tackle Riley Rieff has been playing great all season. Riley Rieff is an aggressive and mean lineman who specializes in using strength to stonewall opposing defensive players. If Riley Rieff can keep Kerrigan off Stafford, look for the Lions to attack downfield through the air.
Lions quarterback Matthew Stafford has been amongst the top quarterbacks in the league this year with many debating on where exactly he falls in the top 10 conversation. This is a game where Stafford could really set himself apart from the other quarterbacks in the league. Stafford has been able to utilize both his arm and feet to get the job done. If this offensive line can give Stafford time, he has a good shot to lead this team to victory, even in a shootout.
Between Stafford's arm and our wide receiver's (Golden Tate and Marvin Jones) open field ability, the Lions could be poised for a huge day against a weak Redskins defense.

Lions Secondary Looks to Take Advantage of Injured Washington Defense
The Redskins have been one of the hottest offenses in the league. A large part of this is due to quarterback Kirk Cousins leading the 4th best passing attack in the NFL. The Redskins have done a great job setting up Kirk for success with their play-calling.
Kirk Cousins has never made plays because of a strong arm. However, if Kirk is given time to throw, he has been able to throw some of the most accurate balls in the game. The Redskins know this and have utilized underneath routes to give Kirk shallower throws. Running this west coast styled offense allows the Redskins to play smart, efficient football. Kirk has been poised and accurate all season.
However, when he has taken shots downfield it has caused issues for the Redskins. Not only has Kirk been inaccurate deep, but he's also thrown 4 of his 6 interceptions into middle to deep coverage. Another issue for Kirk has been in the red zone. He has made poor decisions leading to inaccurate throws, deflected passes, and two interceptions.
All of this was done with a different offense than what will take the field Sunday. Star tight end and favorite target Jordan Reed will be out against the Lions along with talented rookie wide receiver Josh Doctson. With leading wide receiver Desean Jackson listed as questionable, the Redskins may be in trouble against these Lions team coming off its best two defensive performances.
The Lions have been taken advantage of by tight ends all season. Jordan Reed being out is huge as he was set up for a career day. If the Lions are able to stop backup tight end Vernon Davis, the Redskins offense could be in for a slow day, lacking two of their best offensive players.
Prediction: Lions Defeat Redskins 28-20
The Lions offense has been electric recently thanks to Matthew Stafford playing at a top level. If this continues against a mediocre Redskins defense, the Lions have to like their chances. While this defense hasn't performed well this year, the Redskins are without the one player that could have taken advantage of the porous Lion's defense in Jordan Reed. If Kirk Cousins is able to continue his hot start, the Lions will rely on Stafford to win the shootout against the Michigan native.

It's just a matter of time now before the diseases penetrating our border start affecting the American citizen. The border patrol is overwhelmed with the inundation of illegal minors and have been forced to forgo adequate medical examination during processing. Many children are being shipped out with measles, swine flu, pneumonia, scabies, chicken pox, and other undocumented illnesses such as TB. The director of refugee health in the federal Health and Human Services Department had publically admitted their failure in screening these children adequately for infectious and communicable diseases.
Many children with fevers, cough and other signs of occult infection are reportedly being transferred out of the processing center, regardless of their medical status. Numerous others are being transported using public means, subjecting the legal American citizen to unwanted risks of infection.
Despite Obama's best efforts to belittle this mounting crisis, people across the country are growing increasingly concerned about the problem. A recent GALLUP poll clearly showed that the American believed the most serious problem facing the nation now is the rapid and unwanted influx of illegal aliens. It rated higher than both terrorism and the failing economy. However, Obama continues to stand aloof and ignore the will of the people. His neglect and overall abandonment for the American people's wishes and their health has become blatantly obvious as he remains totally impotent on the subject. Stalling any congressional actions, neglecting to send in the National Guard and unwilling to face the problem at hand summarize his lack any effective action to combat this invasion of not only people but also of communicable medical diseases, gangs, drugs and other social problems.
What happened to We The People. Now, it is I the King, Obama.

Initially I had intended creating a piece titled “10 Myths about Hitler” but decided that there were so many, that I switched topic slightly. I understand like most of my work, these areas outlined only give a flavor and are not conclusively resourced. But that's OK. It's a carrot and hopefully just enough for people (even skeptics) to do their own research on these controversial areas. When people find things out for themselves, this has much more substance. All these areas are verifiable. They just take a bit of objective, independent research. There are links at the bottom of the page to help one's research. kkk k
t
t
1/. He never wanted to kill any Jews Whenever you hear anyone espouse (repeat) the lies about Hitler the nasty Jew-killer. Please always make a point of asking this very simple question: “Where did you get that information from?” Perhaps we all at some point have repeated this fable. Why would we not, when it's shoved down our throats 24/7, year in year out for decades(?) There hasn't been a man on this planet who has been demonized as much as Herr Hitler. If Hitler wanted to kill Jews, why oh why throughout all his speeches and manuscripts and his book Mein Kampf did he not mention this? Did he just forget? No, he didn't say or write it BECAUSE HE HAD NO INTENTION OF KILLING THE JEWS. No matter what amount of destruction he had observed done by the Jews to his people; he had enough self-discipline and ethical code not to take revenge. Being a strong character, he was able to rise above the darkness, the demonic standards of the judaic mindset and show self-restraint and humility. That is why he created ‘containment work camps' for the Jews and certainly NOT death camps. k
Because he was one of the good guys.
t
t
2/. He cared about conditions for the Jews in the work camps Unbeknown to billions of people the Nazi camps were not death camps, nor were they place to carry out human experiments. They were simply containment camps. Something had to be done with these destructive anti-social Jews who were strangling Germany. Thanks to the Jews, Germany had lost it's moral code and had become debased and de-cultured ….does that ring a bell? Something had to be done! And Hitler did do something – he placed all the Jews in containment camps to allow Germany to breath again. But – this is the key point in this essay/piece. He did it in a way which was ethical. The camps had decent sufficient food (bearing in mind it was war time), they had theaters, swimming pools, football pitches, post offices where inmates could communicate to the outside world, kindergartens, art and music recreation and even prostitutes. Quality sanitation within the camps was paramount and that is why the inmates clothes were regularly de-loused with zyclon B gas. There were no human gas chambers……THAT IS A BIG FAT KOSHER LIE; to which the world has had to endure for over half a century. My theory is that if there had not had been a war effort, Hitler would not have even made the Jews work. AND I bet you the containment camps would have been luxury rehabilitation centers. In order to slowly de-programme the Jews from their mind control cult. k
Because he was one of the good guys.
t
t
3/. He had compassion for other sentient beings Many historians claim he was a vegetarian. I believe this is kind of true, he was a pescotarian (he occasionally ate fish); but whether this it is or not, the point is he had a clear connection and affection for his fellow creatures. I'm not suggesting just because he may have been a veggie that therefore he was a good person; but this was a man of compassion and that he recognised the importance of compassion in society. He had so much affection for his German shepherds (picture above with his beloved dog). He banned all animal experimentation, recocnizing it to be evil. Hitler could see the connection between all life forms. It was his level of consciousness. Respect for nature, animals and human life. k
Because he was one of the good guys.
t
t
4/. He tried to prevent the destruction of his fellow Europeans Numerous occasions Hitler tried to warn and assist his fellow brethren about the Jewish trap they had fallen for and who really was behind all the warmonger. He dropped fliers from planes trying in vein to prevent Germany and Britain fighting. He initially wanted to make alliances with Britain. Many occasions he gave opportunities to opposing European forces, where he could have slaughtered them. It was his internal spiritual angst for him to be fighting (defending) amongst his European brothers and sisters. He did all he could to avoid war, he was not the warmonger we all have been led to believe. k
Because he was one of the good guys.
t
t
5/. He cared passionately about his people and German heritage Hitler observed the degrading machinations of the Jews in Austria and Germany. It not only disgusted and angered him, but saddened him to see how these two nations were being destroyed from the inside out like a cancer – a cancer that his sleepy folksmen could not see. The exact same angst those of us who are Jew-conscious find ourselves in. He was a man who cared about society, a man who cared about culture, who cared about nature, about moral values and about building and improving as opposed to destroying and degrading. He was a man who had fought for his country, in the trenches and been hospitalized for his country. How many of our sell out politicians today can claim that? He was a true spokesman of the people, for the people who had diligently worked his way up from grass roots. From microcosmic pep talks to his fellow workman on building sites, to talks in beer houses, to speeches in basements, to town halls. As well as all the behind-the-scenes work and risks. Slung in jail, mocked and defamed. Endless tireless work to resolve the destruction of his peoples. I would also strongly suggest he cared about all peoples. Yes, including black people, despite the kosher myth he was a supremacist racist. k
Because he was one of the good guys.
t
t
6/. He was a humble man, from a humble background Can any of us name one present western politician who can claim that these days? No, today they're all criminals, fed through the kosher criminal system. All built on materialistic gain and kudos. All content with serving the beast for their demonic and self-serving interests. Their greed and hubris having no boundaries. Hitler worked on building sites as a laborer for crying out loud. How many of these leaches under the guise of politicians do you know have that background? He was also a humble street artist, barely scraping a living together. Some days he had to decide whether to spend his meager earnings on a political book, or to eat – he opted for the former. Now that is passion in politics and a drive for social reform. k
Because he was one of the good guys.
t
t
7/. He held correspondence with Mahatma Gandhi This alone doesn't necessarily suggest he was a good person. But more that Gandhi and Hitler were in alignment on many issues. They both recognized the evil force they were up against and both were coming from a humanitarian position. The bottom line is Gandhi would not have corresponded with a so-called evil mad dictator hell bent on wanting to kill the Jews and rule the world. k
Because he was one of the good guys.
t
t
8/. He was a man of God Hitler was NOT an atheist – despite what the Jewish propaganda machine wants us to believe. He often made references to God and spoke in terms of a Divinity. He was somebody who could clearly make the connection between Divine law and Natural laws. He was spiritually and morally driven throughout all his political career. Read his book Mein Kampf to see his consistent reference to Christian values.
tk
Because he was one of the good guys.
t
t
9/. He implemented cultural and social reform Throughout Hitler's political career, his common theme was about ‘cleaning up'. He had seen the filth the Jews had created and desperately wanted Germany to reverse these degrading trends. He banned supermarkets, because he wanted local small businesses to prosper. He banned degrading modern art, as he recognised it for what it was. He banned vivisection (animal experiments), because in his wisdom he could see how futile and unnecessary they were. He encouraged healthy youth activities and social programmes to enhance cultural pride and individual self worth, such as sports and recreational activities. He encouraged men to be men and women to be feminine. He helped develop beauty, cleanliness and pride back into the Germany people. k
Because he was one of the good guys.
t
t
10/. He stamped on usury This subject links in most of the points in this list and what Hitler achieved as a leader. But I thought it was essential that this topic was highlighted in isolation, as it was probably the single most important act of bravery and compassion Hitler offered to his people. Unfortunately this act alone was enough to piss off the Jewish IMF and therefore create WW2. Usury is the elite Jews most powerful and demonic weapon amongst their whole armament of destructive weapons. More powerful than their poisons and even their mind control techniques. Because it's their use of compound interest that enables them to create a stranglehold on every industry and therefore every level of society. Nobody can escape usury – everybody is infected by it. That is why Hitler created his own independent currency as a first move when he came to power. And hey presto – that is why Germany was able to get back on it's feet and flourish as all nations should. Hitler recognised the judaic invention of usury as unlawful, ungodly and unnatural – and as a talmudic curse which has crippled every host nation the Jews have entered into and ultimately, that which brings about their demise. Hitler freed his people of this curse. k
Because he was one of the good guys.
k k
~~~~~~
In conclusion Hitler was probably the hero of the second world war and the 21st century. A man of ethical courage, a man of spiritual perception and good intent. A spiritual soul who cared – cared about all life forms, all cultures, about goodness and Light and ultimately about Truth. k
Because he was one of the good guys.

A Philosopher's 'Afterlife': We May Die, But Others Live On
Philosopher Samuel Scheffler doesn't believe in a traditional afterlife — that is, he doesn't think that a spirit or soul survives the body's physical death. But he does believe in another kind of afterlife: Regardless of what we think about our own life after death, Scheffler tells NPR's Robert Siegel, we all trust that others will continue to live after us. And, much like faith in a spiritual afterlife, that belief changes what we choose to do with our days on earth.
Scheffler presented his understanding of life after death in a series of lectures, now published as a book called Death And The Afterlife. As part of All Things Considered's series on what different faiths believe comes after death, Scheffler talks to Siegel about what it means to know that humanity will outlive us. He says without that assumption — often taken for granted — much of what we do would lose its meaning.
Interview Highlights
On the assumption that life goes on after our individual death
Because we take it for granted that other people will live on after we ourselves have died, we don't normally reflect much about the significance that that assumption has for us, and if we call it into question — if we thought that human beings were not going to live on earth for very long after our own deaths — my thought is that that would have quite profound effects on how we live the rest of our lives, that many of the things we now regard as worth doing would no longer seem to us worth doing. And in that sense, it seems as if the assumption that others will live on is more important to us than the belief that we will survive our own deaths.
On why it's not a crisis that we will die — unless everyone else will, too
I mean, it's a mundane fact that everyone around us will die someday, including us and everyone we love and care about. And people aren't exactly happy about that fact, and many people fear death greatly, but it's considered an unremarkable fact. It wouldn't be an unremarkable fact if we thought that no more people were going to be born, that this was it for the human race.

On how long-term research projects rely on this "afterlife"
One thing that happens when you start to think about how you would feel if you knew that life would end shortly after your own death, lots of the things that you now do might come to seem pointless. Like, if you're a cancer researcher, will you still find it meaningful or valuable to pursue cancer research? Quite likely not. I think we implicitly take it for granted that our activities belong to an ongoing temporal chain of human lives and generations, and that if we imagined that, you know, a giant asteroid were going to destroy the earth so there was no future for humanity, suddenly lots of what we now regard as valuable would seem pointless.
On the knowledge that human life on earth will eventually end
Many of your listeners may remember the scene in Woody Allen's movie Annie Hall where the 9-year-old Alvy Singer — it's a flashback scene — is being taken by his mother to a doctor, and Alvy is refusing to do his homework on the grounds that the universe will end someday ... and the doctor assures Alvy that this won't happen for billions of years. And the scene is funny. It seems comical to suggest that just because the universe is going to end in billions of years you shouldn't do your homework, and yet I'm suggesting that if the universe were going to end in 10 or 20 years, Alvy might have a point. ...
It's an interesting question why we react differently to the prospect of imminent extinction than we do to the prospect of eventual, long-term extinction in billions of years.
On how his idea of the afterlife encourages certain choices, much like a spiritual afterlife
It's actually an interesting comparison. Many people who believe in the afterlife as traditionally understood think that if there isn't such an afterlife then the value or purpose or meaning of what we do here and now is diminished, or perhaps lost altogether. I'm suggesting that if there isn't an afterlife in my sense, that really would diminish the point and value and meaning of what we're doing. The nice thing about my kind of afterlife is that we're actually in a position to take steps to make it more likely that human beings will survive long into the future — or, unfortunately, less likely. ...
I think we don't take sufficiently seriously the importance of insuring that human life continues. And, you know, some people are trying to change that, but often they do it by appealing to some sense of moral obligation — "we owe it to our descendents." I'm suggesting that it's not just that they're dependent on us — there's also a sense in which we depend on them. Without them, if there are no future generations, the value of what we're doing here and now is threatened.
Typography is all around us. Fonts are on every document and website we read but also within the ephemera of our lives: on the toothpaste we use, newspapers we read, bus tickets we swipe and the streets we travel.
Our visual habitat is populated with myriad letter forms, all communicating layers of competing information, instruction and message, clamouring desperately for our attention. Our selection and reaction to this communication is largely influenced by the fonts themselves.
Ruth Ellison
The typewriter provided a single typeface without choice and the computer offers a similar abdication of responsibility through its default font.
But access to typefaces is now almost limitless. Just as handwriting expressed individual personality, now vast ranges of fonts can be selected to communicate and enhance meaning.
Why and how do people select fonts? For the non-designer, a process of elimination rather than appropriateness to message is often the guiding principle. Times New Roman would not be regarded as an appropriate choice for a five-year-old's birthday party invitation: it suggests a lack of party games.
Brush Script might not be regarded as appropriate for an obituary: that suggests a certain joy at the passing of the recently departed (perhaps you might like to consider what you judge to be appropriate or inappropriate from the selection below?).
Louise McWhinnie
The choice of typeface is not simply about how it “writes” words, but what the choice of its design and letterforms all combine to actually “say”.
For a typographer, an understanding of the construction of the letterforms, their readability and the cultural and historical context all combine to determine the selection.
The web is full of blog posts and articles by designers imploring us to stop misusing and abusing fonts.
US designer Mark Simonson has written that some fonts act as “novice magnets”:
To the average person, most fonts look more or less the same. But, if a typeface has a strong flavour, it calls attention to itself. It's easy to recognise and makes people feel like they know something about fonts when they recognise it … using it makes their documents look “special”. To the experienced designer, such typefaces have too much flavour, call too much attention to themselves, not to mention the fact that [they] often carry the baggage of being associated with amateur design.
A perfect illustration occurred on the world stage when CERN, the Swiss home of the Large Hadron Collider particle accelerator, announced in 2012 that scientists had discovered a Higgs Boson-like particle.
The announcement of this hugely important development in particle physics was an occasion of gravitas and significance. Unfortunately, Comic Sans was chosen to convey the message.
What should have been the announcement of a major scientific discovery was devalued by an onlooker's image of a lone scientist with a home PC: a stark illustration of how the choice of typeface can devalue content.
hapticflapjack
While many can identify when a typeface jars, the key is in understanding why and then applying that understanding to one's own use of type.
It's important to understand a font is more than simply a tool; it is, in fact, a character. Its visual character can impose on the text as much as a person's voice, cadence and tone influences the reading of a speech.
Melbourne typographer Stephen Banham, in defining the character of Gill Sans, once said:
Whenever I read text set in Gill Sans, I can't help but hear the voice of an English narrator reading along with me.
While certain typefaces inhabit historical and cultural contexts that influence the way they are read, they also impose mood, emotion, attitude, formality and informality.
Fonts have become so much a part of our everyday visual communication and culture they're even the topics of films and documentaries, the most well-known among them being Gary Hustwit's 2007 release, Helvetica.
The character of a font, however, does not simply exist within its positive forms, but also the negative spaces it inhabits through its proportions, inner forms, spaces between letters, words and lines (kerning, word-spacing, leading).
Spacing is to type as breathing and tone is to speech. The way in which space is used aids readability, paces the text and forms hierarchy and emphasis. When used badly, it's what one person referred to as “good type forced to do bad things”. But that's a subject for another article.
Just as Johannes Gutenberg's development of movable type led to mass-produced access to knowledge through the printed word, the availability of the personal computer has democratised accessibility to typefaces.
From the comfort of their desks, people access typefaces that were traditionally the domain of designers and printers. This democratisation is a double-edged sword. Accessibility does not endow knowledge, and increased use does not enhance ability, unless knowledge is sought and then applied.
Reading and writing are not as simple as one thinks. What the author writes, the typeface expresses. Typing and typography are not the same.
An understanding of how letterforms construct words visually, and how those words convey meaning, is essential for communication to be truly effective.
… And, in case you're now wondering, this article is set in Helvetica Neue.
How Anger Helped Me Find the Job I Love
(Jordan, 25 – Retailer – Texas, USA)
It was a Friday afternoon, I have booked a room in a beautiful vacation resort 2 hours away from my apartment. My girlfriend and I were planning this trip for weeks. Our luggage was already in the car when I got the call from my boss telling me he needs me to work to cover a shift. I flipped. I felt the anger filling my body, and I was about to explode…
Anger is a reaction
Everyone gets angry; I am aware of that. It used to be our response to a life-threatening danger, but since modern life has put those situations at a minimum, anger occurs when one is in a situation they cannot control, like the one I was facing with my boss.
Unfortunately, this kind of anger does not provide results that are beneficial for our well-being. It happened to me on several occasions to say or do something I normally wouldn't, that's why I needed to know how to control and channel my anger.
The calm instead of the storm
Luckily, I learned a two-step process on how to manage my anger. The first one is about controlling the first fury and outrage; the second one is about channeling those emotions into something positive.
Counting and breathing: Once my thoughts started processing the information that caused this feeling, the first thing I did was… well, nothing. I stopped right there. I remembered reading how extremely important was to take a few deep breaths and count to five, or ten, even a hundred if that's what's needed to stop that red light pinging over my head. Once I've done this, I was ready to react. Being calm always brings better results.
Positive Channeling: The initial wave of rage has passed. The second phase consists of planning. So, as every movie villain would do, I sat in my cave and plotted my revenge. The energy I had inside due to all that anger was something that could be used to my advantage. I wanted to channel it into something positive, to do it in spite of all the obstacles and annoyances. Was I furious because my grades were bad? I let that motivate me to spend more time learning and do better at school. I became sullen because I was overweight? All that energy from anger can do wonders in the gym.
Anger can be ideal for you
What happened to me and my weekend away with my girlfriend? Well, we couldn't go. But I was so angry that I finally managed to harvest motivation to prepare my exams, earn a degree and find the job I enjoy. Anger can be perfect for you if you understand its roots and find a way to control it.

MIT students will take to the operating table next Monday, Nov. 24, to show off their robotic engineering skills in the final presentations for Course 2.12 (Introduction to Robotics).
Four teams of students have spent the past seven weeks building robotic arms and writing software that will allow them to remotely make an incision in a silicone "organ" and remove a jelly bean masquerading as a tumor.
The final presentation will be held at 3 p.m. Monday in Room 1-005 and is open to the public.
Surgery is a rapidly growing sector of robotics business, says Professor of Mechanical Engineering Harry Asada, who teaches the course.
"Augmenting a surgeon's skills and expertise with superb precision and dexterity of robotic devices, we can expect highly reliable, minimally invasive surgical operations," he says. "However, there are many technical challenges to make the system truly useful."
The course emphasis is on learning to design a robot that can perform a specific task and operate within a confined space, says Harrison Chin, laboratory instructor for the class.
Past years' course assignments include building search and rescue robots, and building robots for automated inspection of Big Dig tunnels.
"We try to motivate it with a real world problem," says Lael Odhner, one of the laboratory TAs for the class and a graduate student in mechanical engineering.
A version of this article appeared in MIT Tech Talk on November 19, 2008 (download PDF).
Washington, DC—Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (HI-02), a member of the Fourth Amendment Caucus, issued the following statement in response to the National Security Agency's (NSA) announcement to end its collection of Americans' Internet communications that may include mentions of a foreign intelligence target. The announcement marks a break in years of NSA policy to collect email, texts, and other Internet communication that merely mention identifying terms for foreign targets, but are not to or from those targets, also known as "about" surveillance.
“For years, Americans have been kept in the dark about our government's unconstitutional collection of their personal communications and data in the name of national security. This change in NSA policy is an important step in the right direction. In order to ensure we do not backtrack on this progress, I will be introducing legislation to permanently codify this policy change to permanently ban this privacy-invading collection."
Background: Rep. Tulsi Gabbard has long advocated for reforms that address our government's responsibility to protect civil liberties and ensure a strong national defense. She has actively sought reforms to Section 702, the Patriot Act, introduced legislation to strengthen and expand the functions of the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board (PCLOB), and is a founding member of the bipartisan Fourth Amendment Caucus focused on protecting the privacy and security of Americans in the digital age.

It is nice to see a talented artist dabble in new sounds. Tweedy started to do this on his last Wilco recording but, this time, he has "thrown caution to the wind" and "hit the mark". "Can't Stand it", A Shot in the Arm", "ELT" etc. all demonstrate that Jeff and his band don't really want to be put into the "Americana" box and that they are not afraid to pay tribute to the KINKS and the BEACH BOYS at the risk of losing the their clique-like Americana audience who are now bemoaning Wilco's departure from their "rootsy" sound. The truth is that their roots are in both American and British music that does include "POP" music.
It was an eye opener to attend a session at SBSW and listen to Steve Earle's promoter extol the virtues of Steve's new Bluegrass(?) Cd and Kelley Willis' new release while bemoaning the new commercial direction of Wilco. All that I could think was: Which of these recordings are really commercial and which are really good art?? In my opinion, Wilco has been more faithful to their art. To borrow a hackneyed if not overused expression: "ART KNOWS NO BOUNDARIES!!"

28 June 2011—Designers of satellites obsess about how little fuel their creations are able to carry into space. So the propulsion method they choose for maneuvers such as orbital transfers has to deliver a lot for a little.
Now a NASA engineer has come up with a new way to fling satellites through space on mere grams of fuel, tens of times as efficiently as today's best space probe thrusters. The answer, he says, is fusion. You might be thinking, "Fusion? Really?" But it's not as far-fetched as it sounds at first blush. The engineer delivered the details today at the IEEE Symposium on Fusion Engineering in Chicago.
Instead of using deuterium and tritium as the fuel stocks, the new motor extracts energy from boron fuel. Using boron, an "aneutronic" fuel, yields several advantages over conventional nuclear fusion. Aneutronic fusion, in which neutrons represent less than 1 percent of the energy-carrying particles that are the result of a reaction, is easier to manage. "Neutrons are problematic, because for one thing they're difficult to harness," says John J. Chapman, the concept's inventor and a physicist and electronics engineer at NASA's Langley Research Center, in Virginia. To make use of neutrons, "you need an absorbing wall that converts the kinetic energy of the particles to thermal energy," he says. "In effect, all you've got is a fancy heat engine, with all its resultant losses and limitations."
In Chapman's aneutronic fusion reactor scheme, a commercially available benchtop laser starts the reaction. A beam with energy on the order of 2 x 1018 watts per square centimeter, pulse frequencies up to 75 megahertz, and wavelengths between 1 and 10 micrometers is aimed at a two-layer, 20-centimeter-diameter target.
The first layer is a 5- to 10-µm-thick sheet of conductive metal foil. It responds to the teravolt-per-meter electric field created by the laser pulse by "acting as a de facto proton accelerator," says Chapman. The electric field releases a shower of highly energetic electrons from the foil, leaving behind a tremendous net positive charge. The result is a massive self-repulsive force between the protons that causes the metal material to explode. The explosion accelerates protons in the direction of the target's second layer, a film of boron-11.
Illustration: George Retseck Click on image for a larger view.
There, a complicated nuclear dance begins. The protons (which carry energy on the order of roughly 163 kiloelectron volts) strike boron nuclei to form excited carbon nuclei. The carbons immediately decay, each into a helium-4 nucleus (an alpha particle) and a beryllium nucleus. Almost instantaneously, the beryllium nuclei decay, with each one breaking into two more alpha particles. So for each proton-boron pair that reacts, you get three alpha particles, each with a kinetic energy of 2.9 megaelectron volts.

Electromagnetic forces push the target and the alpha particles in the opposite directions, and the particles exit the spacecraft through a nozzle, providing the vehicle's thrust. Each pulse of the laser should generate roughly 100 000 particles, making the method tremendously efficient, says Chapman. And according to his calculations, improvements in short-pulse laser systems could make this form of thruster more than 40 times as efficient as even the best of today's ionic propulsion systems that push spacecraft around. Even at 50 percent efficiency, burning off 40 milligrams of the boron fuel would deliver a gigajoule of energy. The amount of power depends on the laser pulse rate. The motor could generate 1 megawatt per second if the pulses are frequent enough to start reactions that consume that amount of boron in 1000 seconds. (According to Chapman, using this aneutronic fusion technique with helium-3 isotopes would yield roughly 60 percent more energy per unit mass. But boron is a more attractive fuel source because it is abundant on Earth and helium-3 is scarce.)
Another big advantage of fusion space propulsion, Chapman claims, is that some of the energy can be converted into electricity to power a spacecraft's onboard control systems. "A traveling wave tube—basically an inverse klystron—captures most of the particles' flux kinetic energy and efficiently converts it into electrical energy," says Chapman. The process, he says, is 60 to 70 percent efficient.
The NASA engineer acknowledges that this collection of ideas is still a long way from being a practical device. For example, losses from the alpha particles striking the walls of the exhaust nozzle or each other lower the net power output. Figuring out how to control the particles' path is an important consideration.
Asked how long it will be before his fusion reactor is pushing spacecraft toward Mars, Chapman acknowledges that a decade of work might be required before that happens. "It takes teamwork to get something to the point where you put it in space," he says. His aim so far is "to get the idea out so other minds can begin thinking about it."

Star Wars fans will definitely want to tune in to tomorrow's episode of Xbox Live Sessions, as actor John Boyega — perhaps better known around these parts as Finn — will appear on the interactive livestream and play EA's soon-to-release Star Wars: Battlefront 2.Boyega, who stars in the new trilogy of Star Wars films and made headlines last year when he publicly questioned EA about the original Battlefront's lack of a single-player story mode, has been heavily involved in this year's follow-up, even lending his voice for a recent trailer for the game.
On tomorrow's livestream, which will be hosted on the Mixer Xbox Channel on Wednesday, November 15 at 11 a.m. PT, Boyega will play Star Wars: Battlefront 2 on the newly launched Xbox One X. Not only will fan get to see Star Wars: Battlefront 2 played on "the world's most powerful console" days ahead of the game's release, but they'll also have the chance to interact with Boyega and ask him questions, as well as win special prizes.Star Wars: Battlefront 2 officially releases on November 17th, but is currently available as an early access trial on Xbox One and PC as part of the EA Access program. Meanwhile, you can catch John Boyega on the big screen when his adventures as Finn continue in Star Wars: The Last Jedi on December 15th.
It's come to this for Mitt Romney: As the public chastisements from his own party pile up, his best, and maybe only, source of inspiration left can be found in the story of a Democrat that Republicans love to hate.
That would be John Kerry, who eight years ago to the day found himself in a political hole rather similar to the one Romney now faces – and who managed to climb out of it and nearly win the election.
Advertisement:
In a way, the 2004 race was a mirror image of this one. George W. Bush's approval rating was low enough to make him vulnerable to a challenge, but not so low that defeat was automatic. It was the kind of race in which campaign events actually mattered, and the trajectory wasn't that different from this year's. For much of the summer, the race was about even, with Kerry generally enjoying a slight polling edge – although he failed to generate a meaningful bounce from his party's July convention. Then, Republicans staged a successful convention in New York, one that leaned heavily on 9/11 and featured savage but effective attacks on Kerry, and Bush opened a clear lead that persisted for weeks.
Just as the post-Labor Day conversation this year has been dominated by Romney's woes, September '04 was a brutal month for Kerry. Polls generally showed him running 6 to 8 points behind Bush, and panic and despair began to set in among Democrats, and to spill into the media's coverage.
The perception took hold that Kerry was blowing a completely winnable election – that he was allowing Republicans to define him as a weak-willed flip-flopper, that he was too often playing to type, and that his campaign was failing to grasp and exploit the incumbent's weaknesses. There were calls for a new strategy and a campaign staff shakeup. In a Sept. 16, 2004, column, Ellen Goodman wrote about the Democrats' “September anxiety attack”:
It's a day when the Bush bounce has hit Kerry supporters upside the head. The morning papers are full of polling reports suggesting that the president is on a roll. The pundits are full of rumors about a Kerry campaign shake-up. The party that came out of the Boston convention in single-file unity has returned to its default position: a circular firing squad with the campaign strategists in the middle. The partisans in the street are frantic that the Bush campaign will "do it again" and take the low road to victory.
To anyone who's been watching the current campaign, this should sound very familiar. Unlike Kerry, Romney never actually led his opponent during this campaign's summer months, but he was close behind and Republicans were hopeful that a strong convention would push them into the lead. But the GOP's Tampa gathering was a bust, and it was followed by a highly successful Democratic event in Charlotte – one that pushed Obama back into a clear lead and that prompted conservatives for the first time to confront the possibility they might lose in November. This has prompted the same very public second-guessing from his own party and campaign infighting that plagued Kerry in September '04.
Kerry's story offers a ray of hope for Romney for two reasons. The first is that Romney isn't as far behind now as Kerry was at this same point. The Real Clear Politics average pegs Obama's lead at just under 3 points (although this number could get worse in the coming days if Romney's secretly recorded comments from a fundraiser earlier this year turn some voters against him). On this same day in 2004, Bush's average lead was 6.7 points. So Romney has less ground to make up.
There's also the fact that Kerry did end up erasing his deficit, or at least most of it. The key moment for him came on Sept. 30, 2004, when he and Bush met for their first debate. Kerry had come to the race with a reputation as a skilled debater, but because of where the race stood at the end of September, expectations actually favored Bush. Thus was Kerry's strong, sharp performance something of a revelation, just as Bush's shaky and erratic showing was jarring.
Advertisement:
Almost overnight, it was a race again, with Kerry closing to within a point or two of Bush in the polling average (and grabbing the lead in a number of individual polls). This is where the race stayed through Election Day – close enough for the political world to treat it as a dead heat for all of October, and close enough for Democrats to stop deriding Kerry and questioning his strategy in public, and close enough for the press to again treat Kerry as a competent candidate.
Of course, we don't now remember Kerry as a solid candidate who ran a good campaign. That's basically because he lost. Had Kerry gotten over the top – and he came within a relatively small number of votes in Ohio of doing so -- the historical account of his candidacy would be much different.
An argument can be made that Romney is an objectively worse candidate than Kerry, one more prone to serious self-inflicted wounds and one hindered by a party base that expects him to articulate some very unpopular policy positions. But Kerry's example shows just how quickly and thoroughly perceptions of a campaign can change. The upcoming debates offer Romney his most obvious opportunity to regain his party's confidence and to alter the media's treatment of him, and it's worth remembering that he's had some success in debates before. This is not a prediction that Romney will stage a comeback in the weeks ahead. It's just a reminder that he could.

Cole Porter's birthplace in northern Indiana needs facelift
PERU, Ind. (AP) — Efforts are underway in the northern Indiana city of Peru to spruce up the two-story wooden house where composer Cole Porter was born in 1891.
A renovation project started in 2004 to transform the house into a three-room inn and museum dedicated to Porter's life. It currently attracts about 10 visitors a month and houses memorabilia from the man who wrote songs like "Anything Goes" and "Night and Day."
"If you're a fan of Cole Porter, this is a no brainer. You want to keep this place going," said John Kirk, who has leased the home from Ole Olsen Memorial Theater since 2013. "If you like Cole Porter, you want this house to be here for a long time."
But the house's exterior needs additional work, especially the peeling 10-year-old coat of yellow paint, which gives it a shabby appearance, the Kokomo Tribune (http://bit.ly/1Nkk0Uv ) reported.
"The inside looks great. It's held up nicely since the renovations," Kirk said. "But the outside needs some help. When you drive by, you wonder if the rooms look like what the outside looks like. It's just not reflective of what we have going on inside the walls."
An online fundraising campaign was launched last month to raise money for work on the home.
The first phase seeks to raise about $12,000 for a new paint job. The second phase aims to raise $5,300 to transform the outdoor patio into a dining area and to install showers in each of the three guest rooms.
One of Kirk's long-term goals is to turn one of the home's rooms into a tap parlor where beer brewed by Kirk Bros. Brewery, which is run by himself and his brother, could be served.
He said the tap room would fit well with the house because Porter's grandfather owned and operated a brewery in the early 1800s.
Kirk noted that keeping Cole Porter's birthplace looking nice is mostly about maintaining one of the city's most interesting and marketable landmarks.
"I think it's important to our community to have this house here," he said. "Not many towns have someone as famous as Cole Porter come out of them. When you live in a town like Peru, you wonder if people can ever make it big, and we had someone who did."

After thorough investigations over Calvin Cheng's controversial remarks last year that seemed to advocate the killing of children (because their parents are terrorists), police have decided to drop the case against him.
One can see why his comments were considered particularly contentious. Here was a member of the Media Literacy Council — dedicated to promoting respect and responsibility on the Internet — who called for the murder of terrorists' children “in case they grow up to take revenge”.

Despite public backlash (and multiple police reports lodged against him), Cheng remained headstrong in the defence of his comments, clarifying that they were taken out of context. He later gave a semi-apology over his remarks, seeming more sorry for allowing himself to be attacked “by people waiting for the opportunity to do me in”. MLC's action was similarly seen as light-handed as they found no fault in the comments made by Cheng, and he remains on board with them.
“After careful considerations of the facts and circumstances of the case and in consultation with the Attorney-General's Chambers, the Police have decided not to take further action against you,” wrote the police in a letter Cheng received. “All investigations and enquiries into the matter would cease and the case will be closed.”
On his side, Cheng isn't done with his haters. Calling for “opposition characters” to stop using police reports as a political tool, he condemned the alleged usage of the police as “a pawn in their petty political games”.
It was a crazy 24 hours for Isaiah Whitehead ... and one he needed badly. On Sunday, the Nets guard was in Canton, Ohio, playing for the G-League Long Island Nets. He led Long Island to a win over the Charge, Cleveland's affiliate, scoring 32 points while grabbing 10 rebounds in 37 minutes of action.
Then, with the Nets hurting, the call went down to Long Island's coach, Ronald Nored: Get Isaiah on a plane to Houston. We need him. Anthony Puccio laid out what happened next...
Isaiah Whitehead was called up by the Brooklyn Nets at 10:30am Monday morning. Nets were playing without five key players, and Whitehead stepped up with 24 points on 10-of-16 shooting. Used his left hand on a couple drives and looked confident doing so. — Anthony Puccio (@APOOCH) November 28, 2017
Final total: a career high 24 points on 10-of-16 shooting to go along with three rebounds, three assists and a steal ... and another 24 minutes. He used a lot of the same moves. Turnovers were still a problem. He had five (and racked up seven in Canton.)
Still, for a guy who had been an after-thought most of Brooklyn's season, Whitehead's performance was a reminder of his game, the Nets' “next man up” philosophy ... and the value of the G-League.
Kenny Atkinson smiled a lot post-game talking about the Seton Hall product's performance, noting that his game against Canton “gave him the rhythm. He's not coming here cold and out of rhythm. He's playing in the same system with Long Island.”
Once in the game, he seized the opportunity and brought the Nets back from their first quarter debacle.
“Against a talented team like that ... Llisten, Isiah has a talent,” said the coach. “He's still a young guy (22). He's got to cut his turnovers down. I keep telling him. I think if he can control that a little bit, but I liked his presence, I liked how he competed.”
As for his future, particularly when the team gets healthy again, Atkinson noted that the organization expects to give him time with Long Island to “fine tune” them, but bringing him up when needed.
“He's got the physical tools with his size. He's strong, lower body too. He's got an NBA body. There's just things to fine tune and he's going to fine tune it this year. You're going to see him back and forth, which is great. I'm really excited about our G-League team, how much that's going to help us. I think it already has.”
One thing seems certain: The Nets have a $1.5 million team option on Whitehead that they have to exercise in June. Before they make that decision, they're going to give him a lot of opportunities in both places.
“That's kind of the model. That's why we have the G-League,” Atkinson noted.
In the annals of strange phenomena, weird events, and unsolved crimes, sometimes there are cases that are hard to categorize. Some cases just seem to cross over from merely odd to come bursting into the realm of the almost absurd. These are the cases that are hard to really classify; are they pure urban legend, a genuine unexplained event, a haunting, a cryptid, or just something poking into our realm from some parallel goblin universe? One case that exudes so much creepiness and bizarreness that it has become unfettered from all attempts to classify it is the case of the Clifton Bunny Man, a demented figure with the appearance of a man-sized bunny that has purportedly terrorized the wooded Virginian countryside for years. It is an eerie story that precariously toes the line between unexplained phenomena, urban legend, unsolved crime, and haunting; teetering on the precipitous edge between reality and madness.
The tale of the Bunny Man started with a series of unsolved, brutal murders that allegedly originated with an insane asylum that existed buried in the wilderness of Clifton, Virginia in the early 1900s. When people started moving into Fairfax County, it is said that they did not take kindly to an asylum full of raving lunatics so close to their peaceful haven and they petitioned to have it shut down. In response to the petition, a new facility, which was known as Lorton Prison, was supposedly built and the inmates were prepared for transport to be relocated to their new quarters.
According to the tale, in the autumn of 1904 the inmates were packed into 15 transports to be moved to the new facility. It is said that sometime during the journey to Lorton Prison, the driver of one of the vehicles violently swerved for the purpose of avoiding something in the road and the transport careened off of the road to spectacularly crash into the dark wilderness. Most of the inmates aboard, including the driver, were killed in the crash, but some survived and escaped into the surrounding landscape, melting into the black of night. The very next day the police were hard at work scouring the area to hunt down the escaped mental patients. After an exhaustive and intensive manhunt that lasted for months, the authorities are said to have apprehended all but two of the estimated 10 convicts that had escaped; a Marcus A. Wallster and Douglas J. Grifon.
The search would prove to offer eery, sadistic little clues along the way. Police and locals claimed that they found many mutilated carcasses of rabbits, some of them hanging from trees, which had been partially dismembered, had had their skins completely removed, and were half-eaten, as well as scattered rabbit body parts. Police would go on to find the body of Wallster hanging under a bridge along the railroad tracks at Colchester Road, with a knife-like tool fashioned from a sharp rock blade and a branch handle in its death grip. Allegedly there was a note attached to the dead man's foot which read “ You'll never find me no matter how hard you try! Signed, The Bunny Man” The police now knew the fate of one of the escaped lunatics, but another was lurking out there somewhere in the wilderness.
As the police searched for the still missing Grifon, they continued to find the mutilated, half-eaten corpses of skinned rabbits scattered haphazardly about, which they surmised had been killed by the escaped convict, and so because of these carcasses, plus the cryptic note that had been found, the fugitive became known as the “Bunny Man.” By April 7th 1905, after an intensive search of the wilderness, the police gave up on the manhunt for the Bunny Man, considering him to be dead or long gone, but he would continue to menacingly haunt the area.
Supposedly, on Halloween night of 1905, a group of teenagers went to the Colchester Overpass, near Clifton Virginia, which was now known as the Bunny Man Bridge; the very one from which Wallster's lifeless corpse had been found hanging. It is said that three of the teens would later be found dead, their throats slashed, and with long cuts up their abdomens as if they'd been gutted like a rabbit. The story apparently caused quite the uproar at the time, with parents warning their kids not to go anywhere near the bridge.
On Halloween of 1906, the Bunny Man allegedly struck again. This time, seven teens were said to be partying under the bridge while one, a young woman by the name of Adrian Hatala, was still spooked by the stories and keeping her distance. According to her account, there was a dim light which approached the bridge, followed by a blindingly bright flash of light emanating from under it at around midnight, after which she could hear the anguished screams of her companions wafting towards her through the chilly night air. When she went running to investigate, she found the bodies of all of her friends hanging under the bridge, mutilated in a similar manner to the teens that had been found the previous Halloween. According to the story, she would apparently eventually be charged with the murders and locked away in a mental institution.
More murders would take place in the ensuing years. In 1913, 1949, and again in 1976 the bodies of several teenagers were allegedly found hanging under the bridge, murdered and mutilated in a similar brutal manner. Throughout this madness, investigations into the killings turned up nothing. During all of this time, a series of strange sightings was starting to crop up around the area, that of an adult-sized person wandering the wilderness near the Bunny Man Bridge dressed in some kind of bunny outfit, often reported as wielding an axe or long knife and often vandalizing property or threatening people. The figure was also seen in surrounding areas as far flung as Maryland and the District of Columbia.
Two of the most intriguing and bizarre accounts of the Bunny Man surfaced in 1970. The first incident occurred on October 19, 1970, when an Air Force Academy cadet by the name of Bob Bennett was allegedly with his fiancée and parked his car on Guinea Road in Burke, Virginia, so that the couple could talk. It was at this time that they noticed a white figure moving outside of the vehicle. Moments later, the front window was smashed into a cascade of glass, and an ominous voice warned “You're on private property and I have your tag number.” The horrified couple sped away and as they screamed down the road they noticed a small hatchet on the floor of the car. When questioned later by the police, Bennett would insist that the attacker had been decked out in a full bunny suit, and he told his superiors at the Air Force base the same thing. As ridiculous as the story sounded, Bennett would continue to insist it was true long after the incident.
Despite the feel of being merely a creepy ghost story or urban myth, the initial story of an unidentified maniac stalking the area was enough to be taken fairly seriously by police. Just two weeks after the Bennet incident, the Bunny Man struck again. Paul Phillips, a private security guard for a construction company, reported that he had seen a man-sized rabbit in front of a house under construction. When approached by Phillips, the rabbit was reported to have said “All you people trespass around here. If you don't get out of here, I'm going to bust you on the head,” after which it started to furiously hack away at the unoccupied house with an axe. Allegedly, when the startled Phillips went back to his car to get a firearm, the “bunny” swiftly escaped into the woods and disappeared.
After that, reports started to pour in of a man-sized bunny roaming the night near the Colchester Overpass, harassing or even attacking people who ventured there. In total, nearly 50 such reports were apparently logged by people claiming to have seen or been confronted by the Bunny Man. The pattern that the mysterious intruder followed was eerily consistent, with couples in cars accounting for the most reports, most of them mentioning the use of a hatchet of some sort, and all describing the same bunny-costumed freakish appearance. The Bunny Man was also said to have a propensity for vandalizing homes, buildings, or pretty much wherever he felt like, so it seems. Numerous mysterious, unsolved murders around the area were also attributed to the Bunny Man, although this is a murky area that lacks any definitive reports or evidence to link a man in a bunny costume to the crimes. Newspapers and TV shows also featured the strange tale of the Bunny Man, mostly referring to the Bennet case.
Additional reports of a maniac dressed as a bunny prowling around the area got so numerous that the tale of the Bunny Man began to take on the air of a spooky urban legend, especially among teenagers out on Halloween Night. One such account allegedly occurred in 1987, when a young woman by the name of Janet Charletier was out with four of her friends on Halloween Night under the Colchester Overpass and they were all messing around trying to scare each other by talking about the spooky Bunny Man legend. Janet didn't really believe all of the stories, but at around midnight, there was a sudden flash of bright light under the bridge and she felt that she had been cut on her chest. In her panicked efforts to escape, she allegedly smacked her head into something hanging there, presumably a body. The story goes that she knocked herself out on the hanging body and when she woke up she found she had been bleeding and that her hair had turned white. Such stories around the Colchester Overpass are so notorious that it is still known to many as the “Bunny Man Bridge.”
Another account claimed that police responded to a report that a man in a rabbit costume was roaming around wielding an axe, who was then referred to as the “axe man.” A unit sent to investigate turned up no sign of the intruder, but shortly after there was a call to police from a mysterious man who said:
You have been messing up my property, by dumping tree stumps, limbs and brush, and other things on the property. You can make everything right, by meeting me tonight and talking about the situation.
In light of such a threat, a police stakeout was launched, but nothing came of it and the alleged Bunny Man failed to show. The head of the investigation, W. L. Johnson, was intrigued by the various reports of man-sized white rabbits roaming about attacking people, but in the end said:
After a very extensive investigation into this and all other cases of this same nature, it is still unsubstantiated as to whether or not there really is a white rabbit. The only people who have seen this so-called white rabbit have been children of rather young ages, and the complainant in this case. Upon interviewing everyone in this case that may have had any knowledge of any incidents concerning a white rabbit, there has been no significant information uncovered that would lead to the identity of the person or persons that were posing as a white rabbit. This case will be marked as inactive.
All police investigations into these sightings came up cold, and in the absence of any leads or evidence, the whole story started to truly take on a renewed life of its own as an urban legend. Tales such as these have since congealed into a full explanation of what supposedly happens at the bridge. The legend goes that if one visits the bridge at around midnight, especially on Halloween night, then the spirit of the Bunny Man will kill them, gut them, and hang them under the bridge. This spirit supposedly starts out as a dim light walking along the tracks above the bridge and then when the kill is near it materializes under the bridge and becomes a blinding flash, during which the ominous Bunny Man will slaughter anyone present nearly instantaneously, typically by slashing their chests and throats. The Colchester Overpass has become rather famous for the Bunny Man, and draws people from all over with a macabre fascination with the stories. Occasional sightings of the alleged Bunny Man continue to this day, and in 2001, 6 local students went out looking for him with a guide. The group purportedly found mutilated rabbit carcasses in the area and were scared off when they claimed to have seen shadowy figures prowling about the surrounding woods.
It is hard to connect these sorts of urban legends and alleged sightings to any sort of solid evidence to show that the incidents ever really happened and are not the fevered imaginings of spooked teenagers out for a good yarn. The original reports seem sound, but are this just a case of a weird case spiraling out of control to take on the form of a creepy urban legend, or is there more to it? Who, or what, is the Bunny Man? Is this a case of a ghost, an unsolved crime, a psycho on the loose, some mystery animal, or merely the delusional human psyche working upon its inner fears to create a phantom construct in the real world in the form of scary stories and myth? The story of a man-sized bunny running around terrorizing, even murdering, people seem to cross over the line from mystery into preposterousness, but many urban legends doubtlessly have their origins in some grain of truth, so who really knows? For the case of the Bunny Man, no matter how ludicrous it may sound, it might be a good idea to stay away from the Colchester Overpass at night, just in case.
Scientists have discovered a new species of toad in the Great Basin of northern Nevada — just in time for its possible disappearance. A geothermal energy plant could be built in the valley where the toad lives, destroying its habitat and spelling doom on the species.
The new toad, called Bufo (Anaxyrus) williamsi, has an olive-colored body “with small, diverse and irregular black flecks,” as well as rust-colored warts. It lives in wetlands fed by thermal springs on the western edge of the Dixie Valley Playa, in an area of less than 1,500 acres. Like other toads in the area, it relies on groundwater to survive. The toads can usually be found in still, shallow water, the study says; it's here that the animal's eggs and tadpoles develop. The animal is described in a study published this week in Zootaxa.
Toad populations have dropped due to habitat loss, and the newly discovered Dixie Valley toad might be in trouble as well, the authors warn. Energy production from Earth's underground reservoirs of steam and hot water — called geothermal energy — to produce electricity has expanded. A geothermal energy plant has been in operation in the area for over 20 years — the largest in Nevada, the study says. New geothermal energy facilities are being proposed. If those are approved and built, they could have devastating effects on the toad's habitat.
The proposed Dixie Meadows Geothermal Utilization Project, which is currently under review by the Bureau of Land Management, would pump almost 46,000 acre-feet of water per year from the underground reservoir, according to the Center for Biological Diversity. (The Center provided funding for the research.) That could slash the water resources the toad needs to survive, and since its habitat is so tiny, it has nowhere else to go.
“It's horrible to think that we may lose this new species just as we're beginning to learn about it,” said Jenny Loda, an attorney and scientist with the Center for Biological Diversity, in a statement.
The Center for Biological Diversity will submit a petition with the US Fish and Wildlife Service to list the toad under the Endangered Species Act. The animal's habitat must be protected if the listing is successful.

Algorithms are everywhere, lending us money, writing the news and potentially diagnosing illnesses. For a few years researchers have also been exploring their use in fighting crime too, typically by sifting through a wealth of statistical data about criminal events in a certain location over previous years, then using that data to extrapolate when crime might happen in that same area. Methods like this are being shopped by tech companies like PredPol and tested by police in LA, Santa Cruz and elsewhere.
Researcher Mirco Musolesi is coming at this emerging trend from another angle. Rather than predict when a criminal event will happen on a particularly susceptible street, he is working on predicting where it would happen. This method is a little more controversial because it wouldn't rely on old crime data, but by tracking potential criminals and their movements via their mobile phones.
This idea was borne out of Musolesi's research into what he calls mobility patterns, which he recently published as part of his research at the University of Birmingham in the U.K. Recently he won Nokia's Mobile Data challenge by predicting the movements of 25 volunteers working in a town in Switzerland. He used GPS data, telephone numbers and their texting and calling history to do it, and the algorithm was at times able to predict where these volunteers were heading to within 20 square meters.
Crucially, the algorithm was only this precise when it also tracked the movements and data of each volunteer's friends. When the algorithm was simply tracking the volunteer, it could predict their future GPS coordinates to within roughly 1,000 square meters. When the prediction took into account additional information from a single friend, the error rate improved by several orders of magnitude.
Though a lot of criminals lack common sense and act spontaneously, most will probably be smart enough to tighten the privacy settings on their smart phones, turning off any location tracking apps and disabling their GPS. But Musolesi says that shouldn't stop his algorithm from tracking potential lawbreakers because the metrics can also be applied using cell tower information, something that even criminals can't hide from.
The geographic location from cell towers might not be as precise as GPS data, but assuming network operators could provide the information (unlikely without a court order) authorities could track someone's movements by triangulating the data from the nearest base station. "If you have a very fine-grain network, you can identify the street and block and house," Musolesi says. The key is then to look for patterns of movement, and intervene when the algorithm suggests future movement to an unusual area.
Musolesi points out that authorities can already get a suspect's position if they really need it, and it's now just a matter of mining the data they have on that person to predict where they might go in the future. It's not exactly the cosmic, bath-swimming, wooden-ball etching scenario proposed by the movie "Minority Report," but does suggest a way that police could better prepare themselves.
"Our algorithm is a way of extracting new information from the data [that police can already obtain]," he says. Musolesi is hoping to work with law enforcement agencies to test how well the algorithm predicts future locations of crime, and he suggests using anonymous data from people on bail in the United Kingdom, who have been electronically tagged.
Facebook already uses algorithms to identify shifty users, which for instance look out for older males who frequently chat with young girls and use words like "sex" and "date." Recently police in the United States arrested a man after he began chatting with a 13-year-old girl and arranged to meet her. Once Facebook tipped off the cops, they moved in.
How would the automated predicting of potential criminals and locations play out in the offline world? Evgeny Morozov, the author of The Net Delusion, recently questioned whether we'd see more racial profiling and stereotyping, problematically sidelining the need for probable cause. And since most crime-predicting algorithms being used today rely on data about reported crime, police who follow them might miss disturbances that often don't get reported; think domestic violence, rape and some burglaries.
"Even in the absence of such reports, the police still develop ways of knowing when something odd is happening in their neighborhoods," Morozov notes. "Predictive policing, on the other hand, might replace such tacit knowledge with a naive belief in the comprehensive power of statistics."
Musolesi admits there are also major privacy concerns with what he's proposing, but suggests experimentation anyway. And he expects that to start with, his research will be more attractive to advertisers than police -- just imagine your local Starbucks using the technology to predict when you're about to go on your coffee break, and sending you a special offer just as you are heading out the door.
The researcher is planning to test the algorithm with larger data sets that he will soon be getting from Nokia, checking it on other types of volunteers to ensure that it works.
He then wants to work towards building a platform, or API, so that other developers can build apps that exploit what could ultimately be a web-based service. "You send a list of the last locations and we will return the predictive location in three hours," he suggests, adding that he is aiming to release the API next year.
Privacy concerns aside, it's worth considering that with plenty of criminals managing to stay one step ahead of the law, they might end up using a service like Musolesi's too.

Apple plans to introduce OLED panels to all iPhone models by 2019. This year's introduction accounted for only 40%, but next year it is expected to double to 80% and 100% next year.
A new supply chain report claims that Apple is planning to use OLED for every iPhone model by 2019, with the company expected to adopt OLED panels for 60 million units of the iPhone 8 later in 2017, equating to around 40 percent of its total manufacturing run (via The Bell ) [ Google Translate ]. Apple will double the adoption of OLED panels for the 2018 iPhone before completely migrating over to OLED-only models for 2019.The same report claimed that both Samsung and Inteflex are currently gearing up production for flexible printed circuit boards (FPCB) for this year's iPhone 8, with Samsung specifically beginning an expansion of its Electro-Mechanics plant in Vietnam to account for the increased Apple supply quota this year.For the 2017 iPhone line, Apple is expected to stick with LCD panels for two of the iPhones -- currently referred to as the "iPhone 7s" and "iPhone 7s Plus" -- while making the "iPhone 8" its first-ever mobile device to include an OLED screen. Today's supply chain report said that Apple will use three suppliers to produce OLED panels, and orders for each will be decided and placed when production is started around April or May.The iPhone 8 is currently rumored to include an edge-to-edge OLED display with an integrated Touch ID fingerprint sensor embedded within the screen. The OLED display is widely agreed to measure 5.8 inches , while the primary area of user interaction will be 5.15 inches , and below that there will be a "function row." The other two models are believed to keep the same aluminum design of current-model iPhones.
OLYMPIA – Clam diggers have a green light to dig razor clams March 25-27 at Mocrocks Beach on Washington's coast after marine toxin tests showed the clams there are safe to eat.
Another option is Long Beach, which is currently open to digging through March 31.
Both beaches have been approved for razor clam digging by the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife (WDFW), which sets seasons for the fishery.
The dig at Mocrocks is scheduled on morning tides and ends at noon each day. The dig at Long Beach switches from evening to morning tides, as shown on WDFW's website at http://wdfw.wa.gov/fishing/shellfish/razorclams/current.html.
Low tides during the three-day dig at Mocrocks are:
March 25, Friday, 8:31 a.m.; 0.7 feet; Mocrocks
March 26, Saturday, 9:06 a.m.; 0.6 feet; Mocrocks
March 27, Sunday, 9:42 a.m.; 0.7 feet; Mocrocks
State shellfish managers recommend that diggers hit the beach an hour or two before low tide.
Under state law, diggers can take 15 razor clams per day and are required to keep the first 15 they dig. Each digger's clams must be kept in a separate container.
All diggers age 15 or older must have an applicable 2015-16 fishing license to harvest razor clams on any beach. Licenses, ranging from a three-day razor clam license to an annual combination fishing license, are available on WDFW's website at https://fishhunt.dfw.wa.gov and from license vendors around the state.
WDFW has also announced a list of proposed digs in April, subject to the results of additional marine toxin tests. Shellfish managers will announce a final decision on those digs about a week before they are set to begin.
Digs proposed for April 9 and 10 coincide with the Long Beach Razor Clam Festival, featuring free razor clam digging lessons and other attractions. More information on the festival is available at http://longbeachrazorclamfestival.com/.
Ayres reminds diggers that fishing licenses for the 2015-16 season expire March 31. New licenses for the season starting April 1 are available online (https://fishhunt.dfw.wa.gov/) and from license dealers throughout the state.
Tentative Razor Clam Dates in April 2016
April 3, Sunday, 4:13 p.m.; 0.5 feet; Long Beach
April 4, Monday, 5:04 p.m.; 0.1 feet; Long Beach
April 5, Tuesday, 5:51 p.m.; 0.0 feet; Long Beach
April 6, Wednesday, 6:36 p.m.; 0.0 feet; Long Beach

Anybody can be an A11y Slacker
There are many ways to communicate about accessible web development practices; mailing lists, forums, IRC, articles, twitter, slack and gitter etc. Each has it's pros and cons. I have been frequenting an A11y Slack (get an invite) of late. I have found it a good place to mix it up with accessibility folk and web developers. But Slack has issues for users; its UI is not accessible and while it can also be used via IRC, the output of IRC has proven problematic. Also an issue with access to chat history arose, which has graciously been sorted by SlackHQ. I also find it a problem that while anyone can join, the content of the slack can only been viewed after sign in.
Giving Gitter a Go
Mike[tm]Smith suggested Gitter as an alternative:
@stevefaulkner Time to switch to @gitchat（actually shoulda began there instead but not too late to fix the mistake…) https://t.co/jQ5TrnYTKn — Michael[tm] Smith (@sideshowbarker) July 15, 2015
So I thought i would give it a go, hence A11ySlackers was born. Some immediate advantages I found; It's publicly viewable without sign in. The archives are public, it integrates with Github, so if you have a github account you can sign in with it to chat. While the web UI sucks accessibility wise to a similar extent that Slack does, the IRC bridge is more practically usable for people who find the Web UI problematic. I have found it easy to scrape (manually at this stage) the public archives to create a permanent record of discussions in a W3C repo:
I have begun filing bugs about Gitters web UI accessibility and suggest other people do the same. The newly formed W3C Web Incubator Community Group is making use of Gitter, so I for one have a vested interest in helping make Gitter more usable and accessible.
Great, what is it?
A channel for anyone and everyone to discuss accessible web development
What it is not: an official channel of the W3C or of any organisation.
So drop in and say Hi or lurk, ask a question or answer a question, share info, help make the web more accessible and usable for all. It's not exclusive, no question is too simple, only rule is: be nice.
Breaking Down Silos with Sameroom
An issue with having venues for discussion on mulitple platforms is that unless people are tuned into multiple places valuable opportunities for knowledge transfer can be lost. We are currently experimenting with Sameroom, a service which allows us to have the best of both worlds (use of Gitter and Slack) as venues for people to discuss accessible web development. Using Sameroom the web-a11y Slack room and the A11ySlackers Gitter room have been joined, so discussion can be carried out between rooms using the service of your choice. It has overcome the issues with Slack IRC bridge (users can log into Gitter IRC and chat with people in slack and gitter) and also we get the benefits of the more public nature of the Gitter service.

Beware of economists bearing models, especially if you are the presumptive Republican nominee for president.
Several recent economic forecasters peered into their crystal balls to predict President Obama will win the coming presidential election. The latest comes from two economics at Yahoo Labs, Patrick Hummel and David Rothschild, who told IEEE Spectrum that the Hawaii-born son-of-a-Kenyan will be reelected with 303 electoral votes, racking up wins in 26 states including Ohio and Pennsylvania.
But the deal is not sealed yet, not by a long shot, Rothschild warns. “There are at least three states here, Virginia, Ohio, and New Hampshire, which are within just a few percentage points of flipping over from one candidate to the other,” he said. If they flip, so does the election.
The model looks at a number of variables: presidential approval ratings (Obama's are trending up), specific economic indicators like unemployment (which is trending down), and state-by-state ideological indicators, such as which party holds the lower house in the state legislature (which has been trending toward Republicans).
But those are not the most important factors in the model. “There is a huge incumbency advantage, and that is coming from a lot of different factors including money, name recognition, and of course it is an indication of past election victories,” Rothschild said.
Of course, if you don't like econometric models, you can always go with single-factor theorists. Robert Prechter, founder of Elliot Wave International, last month published a study that correlated stock market performance with U.S. presidential election outcomes.
He found stock market performance over the past year and past three years was a far more powerful predictor of re-election outcomes than Main Street-oriented economic variables as unemployment, inflation and economic growth. Why? The stock market is a fairly accurate predictor of the nation's mood, and when people are feeling good (that is, stocks are up), they vote for the incumbent.
Based on the stock market's performance so far this year and in the three years since its bottom (It has nearly doubled), President Obama wins in a landslide.

Nashville area home sales slowed last month, but prices hit a new record high. According to relators, the median price for a single family home in the Nashville area is $275,000, up by $25,000 since last year
And in areas like East Nashville, near Five Points, houses are going well above asking price. Michael Page, an interior designer, recently put his East Nashville bungalow on the market as part of a divorce settlement, listing it for $415,000 without a realtor.
"Once the listing went live on Zillow, it was less than two weeks before we had two full price offers," Page says.
The winning bid came $15,000 over the asking price.
Page says he'd love to stay in the house. But he can't afford to buy out his ex's share. They purchased it in 2001 for $129,000. Instead, he's hoping to find a rental in the area. But as far as buying…
"Oh, I don't think I'll be able to afford to buy back into this neighborhood," Page says. "I've thought about looking for the next up-and-coming area, and there seem to be several of those around."
But inventory is tight all over the city. Down by 10 percent since this time last year. According to realtors, the pace of sales can't be sustained without new homes going on the market.
Trump supporter Tayler Ragg thought it would be cool and prudent to report an undocumented student at his college in an attempt to get her deported. He has since been expelled from his school.
The ex-Transylvania University student posted a picture of the victim's Facebook page and captioned it, “Everyone goes report this illegal at my school.”
Ragg has deleted his account and lost his placement at school.
A spokesperson for the school confirmed his departure.
“Taylor Ragg is no longer enrolled at Transylvania University. Per University policy and federal laws, we cannot offer any further details into the matter.”
The girl he harassed, Paola Garcia, has made a video describing what she went through. She was sent abusive messages like, “I can't wait till your f****** c*** ass is gone,” “You and your n***** boyfriend need to leave” and “Hope you enjoy your visit back to the dirt floors of your homeland, stinky ass.”
Open the Pod Bay Doors, HAL How I automated my apartment's lights and locks using an Arduino, a Raspberry Pi, and Flask.
Home automation and remote management is one of the fastest growing and most fragmented sectors of the tech industry. Today's homes can be outfitted with internet-connected everything - lights, outlets, thermostats. That being said, it's still a very young market; its products are often hacky, its interfaces ugly and poorly designed, and the communication protocols divided.
I've bought my fair share of this buggy first generation of devices - I've got a Nest thermostat which I'm very impressed with, some Belkin WeMo light switches which I'm decidedly unimpressed with, and a half-dozen open source wireless light bulbs sold by a New Zealand company called LimitlessLED.
These manufactured solutions are cool, but they're expensive and they don't play particularly well - if at all - together; there is no unified way of managing them. As a solution to this, my roommates and I decided to build a system to tie together what we could of our existing tech as well as add our own custom hardware for controlling our apartment door and building access. We used an Arduino to handle the hardware control, and a Raspberry Pi running a Flask web server to host our website and interface with the Arduino.
The code for this project can be found on Github..\
Doors & Access
The Hardware
The lock on my apartment building's front door - as is the case in almost all Boston apartment buildings- is triggered by a button on a panel next to each apartment's door. This panel also allegedly provides the ability to listen and talk to whomever is waiting below, but our ‘listen' and ‘talk' buttons - like those in almost all Boston apartments - have never worked.
With this in mind, we went about building designing our access solutions. There were actually two separate issues to tackle. Building access was relatively easy, but apartment access would require moving parts to turn the door's deadbolt.
Building access required us to electronically trigger the OPEN button on the control panel while maintaining the ability to actually manually press the button to buzz the door open. With a little bit of EECE 2410 and a transistor, we were able to ‘buzz' our building's door open with a simple logic HIGH on our Arduino.
Your browser doesn't support HTML5 video. You should update your browser.
With building access out of the way, we went about designing our deadbolt lock ‘unlocker'. I'd always wanted to be able to lock and unlock the apartment remotely, and while solutions like the Lockitron and August are succinct and very cool, I'm less than willing to shell out 200 bucks on a unreviewed, untest piece of new hardware.
Building our own was easy (and cheap) enough; we picked up a little servo motor and went about attaching it to our door with a band clamp, and some zip-ties, then hooked it up to our Arduino. We made use of the broken “talk” and “listen” buttons on our door panel by mapping them to the lock and unlock motor functions. This we could control our locks via either the door panel or our website.
The Software
This portion of the project is controlled directly by the Arduino (which in turn is commanded by our web server). The code is simple and really just listens for input and triggers the appropriate action when input is detected.
if ( openButtonState == HIGH ) { Serial . print ( "
open button: " ); unlockDoor (); }
As for website input, the web server handles client-side actions and converts them to serial transmissions to the Arduino. When the user sends the unlock command on the website, Flask uses pySerial to send a value to the Arduino's serial buffer. The Arduino polls this buffer and when it sees a value it recognizes, it performs the corresponding hardware action.
if ( Serial . available () > 0 ) { incomingByte = Serial . read (); if ( incomingByte == DOOR_TRIGGER ) { openDoor (); } if ( incomingByte == LOCK_TRIGGER ) { lockDoor (); } if ( incomingByte == UNLOCK_TRIGGER ) { unlockDoor (); } }
Lights
We have a couple different prefab remote-control light solutions in our apartment. Limitless LED bulbs in the living room, and Belkin WeMo light switches in both my and my roommate's bedrooms.
Your browser doesn't support HTML5 video. You should update your browser.
The Limitless LED bulbs are RF-controlled bulbs which are linked to the internet via a WiFi-RF bridge. The API is stupid-simple and with a very minimal amount of Python code we were able to port the Limitless App's functionality to our own site.
Your browser doesn't support HTML5 video. You should update your browser.
The WeMo light switch were a whole other beast. To start with, Belkin's official WeMo app only works about 30% of the time, so you're never actually sure if this terrible terrible product is actually connected to your network, secondly there is no API. The closest thing I've found to a prebuilt way to interact with WeMo products is iancmcc's ouimeaux project. When the WeMo's are working as they should, ouimeaux works fine as a controller; it's written in Python too which made it very easy to add to our existing Flask project.
Outlets
When I eventually received my Spark Core a whole new set of possible projects opened up. As a proof-of-concept, I ended up building a remote-control outlet and adding it to this web-app. I've written a whole post on it here.
The Web Layer
The backend of our website is Flask. It's lite-weight, it's fast, it's simple to set up, and it's Python - what more could a mobile website ask for?
The backend of the project handles all of our device control. The Arduino that controls our lock and building buzzer is commanded via serial data produced by pySerial. The lights, outlets, and WeMo devices are all controlled via various API requests and make use of a number of Python libraries. More information on these can be found on github.
We implemented OAuth authentication via Flask OAuth to limit site access to a list of authorized users which we keep in a JSON file.
For a good portion of our development, our website consisted of a blank page with some unstyled buttons on a white canvas. One weekend, on a long bus ride to Montréal I found the time to build out a better looking front-end. I wrote templates and views for the two different control modes using Backbone and JST - probably overkill for something so simple - and spit out a half-decent single-page interface.
@ToDo
There are a number of improvements and upgrades I'd like to make to the site. First and foremost, I'd like for our pageload speed to be a bit faster. Our JS could do with some optimization and minification.
In addition to our webapp, we're also working on a Pebble App and Android App. One big piece of functionality I'd like to add is proximity/presence awareness. I'd like to get a service running that is capable of unlocking the door when an authorized user first connects to the apartment's WiFi; at the same time it'd be nice to be able to lock the door in the event that no authorized users are in the apartment. These would likely require some sort of asynchronous task manager like Celery so it might take a while to implement.
From a hardware standpoint, it has occurred to me that the functionality currently shared between the Arduino and the Raspberry Pi could probably have been minimized to just the Pi and its GPIO pins. Though it would require a separate power supply to drive the motor, it would make the project much simpler.
I laser-cut an enclosure for the ugly motor/pipe-band rigging. Originally I was going to 3D print it at my university's shop, but laser-cutting 1/8” wood was much cheaper and I think the finish looks nice.
What is Early Access?
Get immediate access to games that are being developed with the community's involvement. These are games that evolve as you play them, as you give feedback, and as the developers update and add content.
We like to think of games and game development as services that grow and evolve with the involvement of customers and the community. There have been a number of prominent titles that have embraced this model of development recently and found a lot of value in the process. We like to support and encourage developers who want to ship early, involve customers, and build lasting relationships that help everyone make better games.
This is the way games should be made.
How do I get involved?
Check out the listing of Early Access titles currently on Steam, and look for something that strikes your interest. Then buy the game or, if its free, just start playing. And get involved; give feedback, participate in discussions, post screenshots, write guides.
Developers have varying approaches, so it's a good idea to look at a store page before you jump into any game. You'll notice that announcements from developers show up on their store pages now, so you can get a snapshot of recent update or news directly from the source.
What should I look for?
First of all, look for games that are interesting, exciting, and that you want to play. Then, there are a couple things you should consider before making your purchase:
What is the game like to play right now? When you buy an Early Access game, you should consider what the game is like to play right now. Look at the screenshots and videos to see what the game looks like in its current state. There are a lot of ways a game can go as it develops over time, so if you aren't excited to play the game in its current state, then hold off and wait until the next update--it shouldn't be far off. How often is this game getting updated? Take a look at the recent update announcements from the developer (shown on the store page for that game) to get a sense of how active the developer is. Does it look like that game is getting updated a lot? Are they valuable and interesting updates? Pricing of individual games may change over time Some developers will start by offering a discount for buying early while others will charge a premium, depending on their goals and the level of commitment and feedback they desire from Early Access customers.
Is this the same as pre-purchasing a game?
No. Early Access is a full purchase of a playable game. By purchasing, you gain immediate access to download and play the game in its current form and as it evolves. You keep access to the game, even if the game later moves from Early Access into fully released.
When will these games release?
Its up to the developer to determine when they are ready to 'release'. Some developers have a concrete deadline in mind, while others will get a better sense as the development of the game progresses. You should be aware that some teams will be unable to 'finish' their game. So you should only buy an Early Access game if you are excited about playing it in its current state.
How do I get my game listed in Early Access?
We're starting out with a handful of games and will be expanding it over time. If your game has already been Greenlit or you know your next game will be on Steam, then get in touch with your Valve release team and let us know of your plans and interest.
A month after leading Team Canada to victory at the FIBA U19 World Cup, the country's first basketball gold medal in international competition, 17-year-old R.J. Barrett—short for Rowan Jr.—is with family and friends on a Friday night at Goldring Centre for High Performance Sport on the campus of the University of Toronto-St. George. He's there to take in the last night of OVO Bounce, a week-long pro-am basketball showcase organized by Drake and Jordan Brand.
Wearing a black tee that says “Canadian Built,” and a pair of Air Jordan 13s from the recent Defining Moments Pack (the metallic gold accents on the midsole, perhaps a perfect nod to his recent gold medal win), Barrett is relaxing in his courtside seat. He's aware of the increased spotlight on him since last month's FIBA gold-winning tourney in Egypt, highlighted by his 38 points, 13 rebounds and five assists performance in a 99-87 upset win over Team USA in the semifinals—a game in which Team Canada entered as 20-point underdogs.
Throughout the night, family and friends, and even strangers, drop by to pay their respects to R.J.. For someone who has accomplished everything possible at the tender age of 17 and is now at the top of every basketball conversation in Canada, there is one thing R.J. has yet to do: beat his dad Rowan Barrett one-on-one. Asked about the one thing lacking on his resume, R.J. grins and stammers, before dad Rowan, standing next to him, chimes in. “It's a very simple question. With a very simple answer,” Rowan says, with a grin wider than his son's.
The Barrett household has always been a competitive one. R.J's mom, Kesha, was a track and field star at St. John's University. Rowan played basketball at the same school and had an extended pro career overseas, and represented Team Canada at the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, Australia. So, one-on-one matches were not uncommon between R.J. and Rowan. “He just gave me fadeaways, pump fakes, a whole bunch of stuff,” R.J. says. “I couldn't guard him when he was younger.”
Rowan knew his son could never beat him, but nonetheless there were lessons to be learned in those lopsided matchups. “I was teaching him to never quit,” Rowan says. “He was never gonna win. It was more about understanding what his effort level would be consistently, no matter what the result was, because that's the one thing he can control.”
While playing overseas in Spain, Argentina, Venezuela, Greece, Israel, Italy and France, the family traveled with Rowan, and that's where R.J. fell in love with the game. As a kid growing up, he had other interests, including soccer and track and field. Rowan didn't necessarily want to push his son towards basketball. It had to be his own choice. Rowan had his own reasons too. “It's such a long road,” Rowan says. “I know how long a road it is.”
To figure out whether R.J. really wanted to play basketball, Rowan tapped into his son's competitive nature. If it wasn't posting him up for baskets, Rowan would put his son in games against competition he wasn't necessarily ready for. As a 12-year-old, R.J. went up against players that were three to four years older than him. There was one particular game when R.J. came home and cried. “It's probably the worst he's ever played,” Rowan says. “He saw the gap between himself and [the older guys].”
“I didn't play well. I needed to work a lot harder,” R.J. says. “It was a reality check.” From that day on, he decided to dedicate his focus to basketball. Today, R.J. is projected as a top-3 pick in the 2019 NBA Draft. He's currently attending Montverde Academy in Florida, and recently announced his decision to reclassify to enter the draft a year earlier than expected. Outside of basketball, R.J. says making the honor roll at Montverde is his proudest accomplishment. Rowan has always emphasized the importance of education, and wouldn't allow his son to play if he didn't make certain grades. “Thankfully, he never went below that standard,” Rowan says.
On the court, R.J. has an offensive game reminiscent of James Harden when on the perimeter and of Dwyane Wade when finishing at the rim. Roy Rana, head coach of Team Canada's U-19 squad, saw R.J.'s coming-of-age performance up close. R.J. averaged 21.6 points, 8.3 rebounds, 4.6 assists and 1.7 steals in the tournament last month. After his dominant performance against Team USA, R.J. followed it up with 18 points and 12 rebounds in a championship win over Team Italy. He was named the tournament's Most Valuable Player.
“The way he puts together games, it's unique for a guy who still has incredible room for growth,” Rana told the media at Toronto's Crown League in July. “What we haven't had is someone take us to the finish line, and R.J. was able to do that. That's what really separates him.”
There's probably nobody who knows just how difficult the finish line is more than Rowan, who signed with the Toronto Raptors and Philadelphia 76ers at one point but never ended up appearing in an NBA regular season game. At the 2000 Summer Olympics, Team Canada appeared on their way to a potential podium finish, but ended up finishing 7th. The men's basketball team hasn't been back to the Olympics since.
After a career of near-successes, to see his son lead Team Canada to the gold medal at the U19 World Cup was special to Rowan for many reasons. As a former national team member, Rowan received congratulatory messages from former teammates. As a father, Rowan was brimming with pride. “You're going to be super excited when your boy plays that way, and just grabs the bulls by the horns, especially against Team USA. That was the game everyone was waiting for in the tournament,” Rowan says.
There's a third role that Rowan plays, and that is the Executive Vice President and Assistant General Manager of Team Canada. If Team Canada qualifies for the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo, R.J. will likely be involved. “It's been a dream to play at the Olympics since I was a kid,” R.J. admits. A podium finish there would bring things full circle. The 2000 Olympics was also the year R.J. was born. The star of that team, Steve Nash, who's now Team Canada's general manager, is R.J's godfather, and has offered plenty of advice. “He's talked to me about the [NBA] life and how it is; to not take it for granted,” R.J. says. “He told me to just keep working hard and that being the underdog is the funnest part.”
R.J. has also heard the whispers from people who already believe he will be the best player to ever come out of Canada. “You have to just keep working hard and make that happen,” R.J. says. “It's going to be really hard.”
Rowan believes his son is up for the challenge, but even he won't allow himself to think about seeing his son take the court in an NBA uniform.
Rowan prefers to stay in the moment, and it's an approach that R.J. subscribes to as well. Both father and son admit to wanting to focus on improving everything on the floor this coming year, from ball handling, to his jump shot, to being a better passer, and to strengthen his body so that he can be a stronger force on the defensive end. “We know what the goal is,” Rowan said. “We're just looking at every single day that needs to happen.”
Rowan has a lesson for his son that he's preached forever: to always die hard on the court. “That was always the term for him,” Rowan explained. “Did you die hard? If I scored three times in a row, did you double up your effort and go harder? It was always the thing with him, to die hard. That was something that stuck with him. I think he dies hard on the court.”
The path to the NBA is clear now although there are many more challenges ahead for R.J. And about that one-on-one game—Rowan considers that a rite of passage for him. “We haven't played since we were younger,” R.J. said. “I don't think it's a competition now, but we'll wait and see.”
Rowan has a bad back right now and wants to get healthy first. Proposed to have a game up to 11, Rowan would prefer it just go up to seven. The only thing he can guarantee is that it will be a physical game. “He's coming,” Rowan said. “But I die hard.”

A little girl with a super powered dream!
When I took my daughter on her first trip to the comic book store, she was blown away. As soon as she walked into Samurai Comics, her eyes grew as wide as saucers, as she scanned the walls and corridors filled with comic books! Those first steps brought her face to face with with a world of wonders, imagination, excitement, and adventure!
After spending quite a bit of time looking through various comics, she finally settled on her first books. Clutching her Megaman and Teen Titans to her chest, she walked up to the register with a huge grin of delight. Then, the employee handed her a flyer and told her to make sure to come back for Free Comic Book Day.
FREE COMIC DAY?!
She read through the flyer with excitement, occasionally shouting out what we could expect to see there. Ghostbusters! Superheroes! Free comic books! More free comic books with a library card, cans of food, or if you dress up in your own costume! There would even be a costume contest where the first prize was something from Lego!!! This girl was beyond excited and it was awesome!
For the next few days, she alternated between wanting to dress up as Robin, The Flash, or Batman. Finally, she ran into the living room with an excited, “I've GOT IT! Mom, I'm going to dress up as Wonder Woman!!!”
She drew a diagram of the outfit she wanted to make, and labeled it with the materials she would need. Once she calculated the expense of her project and matched it to the budget I gave her ($25 or less), we were off!
Then… she made something completely amazing.
She made this incredible Wonder Woman costume all by herself!!! While she was working on it, I took notes on her steps and have turned them into a tutorial you can follow below:
KATIE'S SUPER AWESOME DIY WONDER WOMAN COSTUME!
Materials Needed:
White poster board
Ruler
Fabric measuring tape (preferred, regular measuring tape will work too)
Pencil
Scissors
2 rolls of gold, glittery duct tape
1 roll of white duct tape
Red floral spray paint (we used Design Master in Holiday Red, that we purchased at Michaels)
Metallic gold acrylic craft paint
Red and white felt sheets
Rubber bands
Brads (we used star brads and painted them with nail polish)
Hot glue gun
Small Phillips screwdriver
Note: This post contains affiliate links to products.
Thrift Store Items:
Red Tank Top
Blue skirt
Belt
Braided rope belt
Black boots
Making the crown
1. Use the tape measurer to measure the circumference of your head. Use your ruler to mark out these measurements on your posterboard. Make sure you also measure your desired height of your crown! Katie used a separate piece of paper to test this out and then we were able to cut it down until she was satisfied.
2. Divide your circumference into 3. Make three light marks on your crown outline on the posterboard. The second third will be where the peak of your crown will be.
3. Cut out your two crown pieces and wrap them in gold duct tape!
4. Glue the peak to the back of the crown. Now it's time to work on your star emblem!
5. Draw out your desired star on your posterboard. Make sure it's large enough to be seen in the center of your crown! Cut out your star. You'll be using this as a template for future costume pieces.
6. Trace a star onto a piece of red felt. Cut it out and use hot glue to secure it to the center of your crown's peak.
(Optional: We used red glittery nail polish to paint our star brads to secure Wonder Woman's armor. Do that now, and let them dry while you're doing the next step!)
7. Using your Phillips screwdriver, make a small hole near the ends of your crown. You'll want the holes to be about a 1″ away from the edges. Poke your brads through and secure them. Then add hot glue to make sure they'll stay in place.
8. Secure a rubber band around one of your brads. Now when you put your crown on, you can fasten it to your head with the rubber bands! To fasten, simply loop the rubber band around the other brad.
Making the gauntlets
9. Measure the length of your forearm, from approximately 2″ below your elbow to your wrist. Mark out this length vertically on your posterboard.
10. Measure the circumference of your wrist, marking the length at the bottom of the mark on your posterboard. Then measure the circumference of your upper forearm. Mark this measurement at the top of your posterboard markings. Connect the measurements, making a sort of trapezoid on your posterboard. When you cut this out and bend it over your arm, it should fit just about perfectly!
11. Cover your arm bands with gold duct tape. Bend them over your arm again until they retain a bent shape.
(Optional: We used red glittery nail polish to paint our star brads to secure Wonder Womans's armor. Do that now, and let them dry while you're doing the next step!)
12. Take your small phillips screwdriver and poke two holes 1″ away from the edges of your gauntlets. One hole should be near the top, the other should be near the bottom. Then do the other side of your arm band. Repeat the process for your other arm band!
13. Poke the brads through the holes, and use the same process you did for the crown to secure them in place.
14. Trace two stars on your red felt. Cut them out and secure one to the center of each armband, using hot glue to keep in in place. Now you're done! Making the chest plate and skirt! 15. Take your red tank top, and measure from armpit to armpit. This will be the base of your chest plate. Then measure the width of the neckline, which will be the top of your chest plate. 16. A simple google search for “Wonder Woman Chestplate Template” will yeild plenty of designs for this piece of armor. Katie decided that she wanted to make her own, so she drew out a design on her posterboard. She made sure that the length and height corresponded with her measurements, and that the dip in the “W” and the eagle were in the true center. 17. After finishing your Wonder Woman design, cut it out! Cover your chest plate in gold duct tape, and use plenty of hot glue (we used a stick and a half!) to secure it to the tank top. 18. Now it's time for the skirt! Using your star piece from earlier, trace out several stars on your piece of white felt. Use hot glue to secure these in a flag pattern on your skirt. That's it! Making the belt and the Lasso of Truth! 19. Lay out your belt, and think about how big you want your diamond armor piece to be. Measure the width and height and mark it out on your posterboard. (Note: Katie made sure to mark out where the belt would run through the back of her armor piece. This way, she could make sure that both peaks would stick out as far as she wanted them.)
20. Cut out the armor piece and cover it with gold duct tape. 21. Use the star template to cut a star from your red felt and secure it to the center with hot glue. 22. Now it's time for the belt and the Lasso of Truth! Using your metallic gold acrylic paint, paint one side of your braided rope belt/lasso and let sit to dry. 23. While waiting for the side of your rope to dry, take your belt and cover it with several strips of gold duct tape.
24. Paint the other side of your braided rope belt and let sit to dry. 25. Use the screwdriver to open the belt holes back up so you can fasten it later. 26. When the braided rope/lasso is completely dry, roll it into a lasso shape and secure it in place with hot glue. 27. Make Belt Loops! When Katie went to put her belt on, she found a rather unpleasant surprise. The duct tape made the belt too thick to go through the belt loops! So, you may need to make new belt loops with your posterboard. Paint them gold and secure them to your belt with hot glue. Make sure they are long enough to make a big enough space for your belt to fit through! Making the boots Once the belt and the Lasso of Truth were completed, it was time for the final piece of her costume.. the boots! Now, we had done some research on the best way to make these boots. Professional cosplayers recommended using a multi-purpose floral paint for fake leather (pleather) boots. So, we went to Michael's and bought some multi-purpose floral paint, in Holiday Red. 28. This really needs to be done in a well-ventilated area. Take an old blanket or crafting table cloth, and bring it outside. Then, break down any boxes you have and lay them around outside of the blanket to catch any over spray. If you're doing it near your house, lean cardboard against the sides of your house to catch for overspray too. 29. Shake the can of spray paint vigorously! Then using several applications, spray a light coat of paint evenly over your boots. It dries fast, so you're able to do another coat within a minute or two. Katie and I took turns spraying light coats of spray paint and within about a half an hour, her boots were finished! We were really pleased with how they turned out! Not only was the color perfect, but the texture of the boots was amazing! It didn't feel like we had spray painted them at all. It felt like we could have picked these up at a store and brought them home just like this! The boots were still relaxed and comfortable to handle and wear.
30. Let your boots dry for 24 hours before going on to the next step. 31. Now it's time to add the white duct tape to finalize the armor pieces! For this, measure your desired length for the peak of the armor plating. Then measure out a triangle on you posterboard and cut out the template. 32. Tape 2 long pieces of duct tape together, putting the sticky sides against each other. Repeat this step so you have two long pieces of material to work with. Then take another piece of duct tape and connect those together, essentially making a large rectangle. 33. Trace the triangle out on the duct tape and cut it out. Repeat all of these steps to make the armor plating for the second boot.
34. Secure the armor in place on your boots! Katie used hot glue to secure the armor peaks to the top of the boot. 35. Measure the length of the boot from top to bottom, allowing a relaxed curve where the boot curves to the foot. Cut a matching length of white duct tape. Cut THAT in half, lengthwise. Now you'll have both stripes for your boots! NOW YOU'RE FINISHED!!!! Katie was ecstatic when she finished her boots! Now her whole costume was finally completed!!! She ran into her room to put it on, and I handed her my favorite red lipstick as her special finishing touch. Then I walked outside so she could surprise me…. Her costume looked INCREDIBLE!!! All of that time was so very well spent and this kiddo was super proud of her Wonder Woman costume. She did such an amazing job, and I am so proud of her! She spent a good half hour doing the coolest Wonder Woman poses on our driveway, and couldn't wait to take it out and show it off to her friends! The next day was the kickoff to Free Comic Book Day weekend, as we headed off to the library for their superhero extravaganza! Katie was the talk of the room as she talked comics with kids and comic book authors alike. She met with the amazing cosplayers of the Justice League Arizona and had a great time with the likes of The Flash, The Green Lantern, and The Joker! The next day brought the moment we had both been waiting for… It was Free Comic Book Day at Samurai Comics!!! The dream that started it all! Free Comic Book Day, dressing up in costume, and entering the costume contest! She was bouncing with excitement and couldn't wait to get there!
Katie was in comic book heaven as she perused the free comic books, scoring extra books for her amazing costume, and for showing her library card! We bought some extra comics for ourselves, and walked out of there with fifteen comics total! She had an AMAZING time. And of course, she entered the costume contest… AND SHE WON!!!!!
She totally won the $25 Lego gift card, and now she can finally buy her own Lego set!!! She was SO thrilled, and so very proud of herself! This was something that started out as an idea in a comic book store, and she completely brought it to reality with her hard work, dedication, and perseverance through troubleshooting. I am SO proud of her and so impressed with her amazing costume making skills! Now that she reached her goal of making it to the SamaruiComics costume contest, and to the library's Free Comic Book Day Eve extravaganza… she's got a new stage in her mission…. Tracking down the grown up Wonder Woman! She's been trying to find her during her comic bok excursions, and we'll continue to be on the lookout! When she does find her, she wants to talk shop about cosplay and ask her some questions about The Justice League… So, we'll be making our way to Phoenix Comicon! I'm sure we'll find Wonder Woman there! We'll see how it goes. In the meantime, GREAT JOB KATIE!!! You're super awesome!!!
