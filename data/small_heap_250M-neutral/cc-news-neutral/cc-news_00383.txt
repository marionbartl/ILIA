HBO has released the trailer for Game of Thrones Season 7 Episode 6, and you'd be forgiven for mistaking it for a trailer for a major blockbuster fantasy action movie. Indeed, as this trailer states, Winter is here, and next week's episode (the second-to-last of this abbreviated season) looks to be a massive showdown between Jon Snow's wily band of misfits and the Army of the Undead, lead by the Night King. Last night's episode of Game of Thrones, titled “Eastwatch”, was very much a table-setting installment that paved the way for an action-packed episode such as this one, and given Game of Thrones' proclivity for using its penultimate episodes to do the “big stuff” and the finales for the denouement, I'd say we're in for a pretty intense time.
Indeed, we should've known something was up when we saw Alan Taylor was directing this episode. The Sopranos and Mad Men alum helmed a number of Season 1 and 2 episodes before moving on to direct films like Thor: The Dark World and Terminator: Genisys. They make their triumphant Game of Thrones return for the first time since Season 2's “Valar Morghulis”, and it appears he's been enlisted to bring quite possibly the biggest battle sequence yet to the screen.
It's also interesting to note that unlike “Blackwater”, this episode doesn't appear to be entirely focused on the battle at hand. We still see that the animosity between Sansa and Arya (stirred up by Littlefinger) is brewing and will be dealt with within the episode, but that's probably where the installment will begin before focusing full-time on this Eastwatch battle.
Check out the Game of Thrones Season 7 Episode 6 trailer below, click here to read Allison's full recap, and click here for a refresher on whom those White Walkers are, what they want, and how they plan on getting it. Stay tuned, folks. Winter is here.

WINNIPEG — The Mayor and their inner circle have officially called for a public inquiry into the scandal-plagued police headquarters project.
Mayor Brian Bowman tabled the walk-on motion at a meeting of the executive policy committee on Wednesday morning.
Bowman said recent allegations surrounding the project are very damaging to public trust in city hall and an inquiry will hopefully restore that trust.
READ: RCMP allegations most seriously damaging to public trust
The motion called for the province to lead the inquiry and broadly examine decision making around the project that could impact other city endeavors.
The issue was first raised in January after court documents revealed new allegations from RCMP.
At that time Manitoba's Justice Minister Heather Stefanson said in a statement to Global News they wouldn't be prepared to call an inquiry until the RCMP had wrapped its investigation.
“While our government understands the concerns raised by the Mayor of Winnipeg, it would be premature for the Attorney General of Manitoba to comment on an issue that remains under active criminal investigation. This is vital to ensure the integrity of the process‎.”
Members of the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association (AOPA) now qualify for an exclusive discount on the King Schools Drone Pilot License Test Prep Course.
“AOPA's recent creation of a Drone Pilot Membership welcomes people who fly, or desire to fly, drones,” said John King, co-founder of King Schools. “Many will be hoping to acquire a Remote Pilot Certificate and this discount will make it easier for them to reach that goal.”
AOPA Senior Director of UAS Programs Kathleen ‘Kat' Swain added, “We are happy to add another great benefit for our members. ”
AOPA members can purchase the King Schools Drone Pilot License Test Prep Course for $108 (retail $129).
Kino Lorber has acquired most North American rights to “The Force,” an acclaimed documentary about police reform. Peter Nicks, the filmmaker behind “The Force,” won a prize for directing the documentary at this year's Sundance Film Festival. It is expected to get an awards push.
“The Force” arrives as the issue of police brutality has inspired a nationwide debate. It follows the Oakland Police Department over the course of two years as a new chief tries to make their officers more accountable and more aware of racial inequities in the criminal justice system.
In a positive review, Variety critic Owen Gleiberman wrote, “The strength, and fascination, of ‘The Force' is that the movie isn't on anyone's side. It's cognizant of the brutality and violence that police officers, in our era, have been caught on phone cameras committing. At the same time, it's not out to demonize the police — it's out to capture the pressures they're under, and to show us what their job looks like from the inside.”
Kino Lorber will oversee the film's theatrical rollout. It does not control television and streaming rights for “The Force.”
Its theatrical run starts Sept. 15 in New York and the Bay Area. It will then open in Los Angeles on Sept. 23. A national expansion will follow throughout the fall, before a VOD and home media release in 2018.
The film will show twice this week at the BAMcinemaFest in New York. Nicks will be present at both screenings to answer questions from the audience.
“We are thrilled to partner with Kino Lorber to release ‘The Force' to audiences at this important moment in the history of police/community relations,” Nicks said in a statement.
“The Force” is the second film in a trilogy of documentaries concerning the relationship between public institutions and the communities they serve on the East Bay city. It is a follow-up to 2012's “The Waiting Room,” which examined under-staffed hospital emergency rooms. The third film in the series, “Homeroom,” which will center on schools, is still in development.
Nicks previously worked as a staff producer for ABC News in New York and as a producer for the PBS documentary series “Life 360.” Their documentary films are rooted in their hometown. They live in the San Francisco Bay Area with their wife and two children.
Recent Kino Lorber releases include the Oscar-nominated “Fire at Sea,” a documentary about the migrant crisis in Europe; and “Obit,” a look at the New York Times' obituary writers.
“The Force” is a co-production of Open'hood, Inc. and a co-production of Independent Television Service (ITVS). Funding was provided by the Corporation for Public Broadcasting.
The deal was negotiated between Kino Lorber senior vice president Wendy Lidell and Cinetic Media's Jason Ishikawa.
Hollywood hasn't been this on edge since the advent of talking pictures nearly a century ago.
Across every studio lot, in the halls of every network, production company and talent agency, there's a level of angst that has spiked far beyond the usual panic over opening-weekend box office numbers or the ratings of a big-budget series.
The cause of all the tumult and tsuris? The threat to traditional film and TV businesses posed by the five horsemen of the digital apocalypse: Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix and Google. Their internet-fueled growth over the past decade has left Hollywood scrambling to overhaul core business models to reach consumers directly — instead of indirectly, through distributors. The dread is that the menace posed by the so-called FAANG posse will get worse: Many speculate that the infidels have only just begun to storm the castle, and have yet to tap their formidable balance sheets to muscle deeper into the content arena.
While CEOs plot M&A strategies to try to keep up, rank-and-file employees worry about being left behind in the chaotic shuffle. “There's still a lot of fear — these are political institutions, and people are looking to hold on to their job security,” says Rob Gardos, CEO of Mediamorph, a data-analytics firm whose clients include major studios and TV programmers. “Some folks are struggling with letting go of the old business models.”

The industry is also biting its nails over the fate of the three megamergers that are on the brink: AT&T and Time Warner; Disney and Fox; and Viacom and CBS.
Hollywood has been through waves of consolidation in the past. But one of the biggest concerns today is the question of where it will all end. The yearning for size and scale to match the global reach of Facebook, Netflix and others has sparked innumerable “what if” deal conversations that are increasing in number and ambition.
Tectonic shifts in the media and entertainment sectors are breeding uncertainty and nervousness among industry insiders, just as Al Jolson's tinny crooning in 1927's “The Jazz Singer” signaled the wildly different future that lay ahead for the business back then. Few feel their jobs are secure in a world where Rupert Murdoch decides to sell Disney most of the media empire they built brick by brick.
The fear is real, says a top executive at a major studio. One of the really scary aspects is that the entertainment parts of the new-media companies, with the exception of Netflix, “don't need to be profitable,” the person says. “For Amazon, it's almost a loss leader.” In other words, it's an asymmetrical battlefield.
Traditional players are on a kind of DEFCON two-and-a-half alert — just short of mobilizing the troops for imminent nuclear war, says MediaLink's JC Uva, who leads the consulting firm's M&A and investment practice. “The big, scaled tech players are looming over them and are driving a large part of their strategic decision-making,” they say.
Dread was in the air when Sony Pictures Entertainment leaders summoned studio employees for a company-wide meeting on April 12. Many staffers entered the Culver City studio's cavernous Soundstage 15 with grim faces, expecting to hear news about a sale or pending layoffs or another management shakeup. It turned out to be a pep rally to celebrate the strong global performance of “Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle” and other recent successes.
Still, few industry observers expect Sony Pictures to exist in its current form in three to five years' time. The same can be said for Lionsgate, MGM and even bigger players such as Comcast/NBCUniversal.
AT&T is fighting the U.S. government in court to acquire Time Warner's content bundle of HBO, Warner Bros. and Turner. Disney chased down 20th Century Fox in a bid to transform itself as the world's largest entertainment company embarks on its second century in business.
All eyes are on the outcome of the Dept. of Justice's antitrust case against AT&T and Time Warner, which seeks to halt the $85 billion takeover. If the merger goes through (albeit with certain conditions), industry observers expect it to unleash a new torrent of deal making.

Time Warner CEO Jeff Bewkes, who testified in the trial on April 18, labeled the government's objections that the combined company would abuse its market position “ridiculous.” They seemed to suggest the DOJ doesn't understand that the world has changed, reiterating the position that Time Warner is relatively hamstrung compared with giants like Facebook and Google when it comes to data analytics. It knows how many people watch its TV networks. “But we don't know their names. Our direct competitors do,” they said. “They know all sorts of things that we don't.”
Whichever way AT&T-Time Warner shakes out, boardroom machinations are already well under way among traditional players to better battle in an internet-connected world.
CBS and Viacom are engaged in their reluctant courtship in an effort to clear the path down the road for an even bigger transaction (Verizon has kicked the tires). Discovery raised the curtain on its enlarged suite of lifestyle-oriented cablers following its $15 billion acquisition of Scripps Networks Interactive at a well-received upfront on April 10. The next day, there was speculation in the industry that Discovery could be an acquisition target for Amazon given the natural linkage between channels like Food Network and Animal Planet and Amazon's retail core business. There are also persistent rumors of a rollup between Discovery and other assets connected to its major shareholder, John Malone, such as the U.K.'s ITV and All3Media. Fox's Endemol Shine Group could also be part of that mix.
Disney, in addition to consolidating Fox's assets, also has planted a flag in the streaming world. It acquired majority control of BAMTech, the streaming-video provider formed by Major League Baseball, for around $2.6 billion. This month it launched ESPN+, its $5-per-month digital-only sports streaming service, under the auspices of a new direct-to-consumer group headed by Kevin Mayer. That's also the group that's assembling a Disney-branded subscription product, after CEO Bob Iger made the decision to end the company's Netflix output deal starting with 2019 releases. “If the Disney princesses are available only on Disney, that's a pretty good sell — even against a Netflix, at least for a certain subset of consumers,” says industry consultant Peter Csathy.
Netflix's eye-popping domestic and international subscriber growth — reaching 125 million worldwide at the end of March — has only fueled the urge to merge. Exuberant investors have rallied to kick Netflix shares to record highs, giving it a market cap of more than $145 billion. That's within shouting distance of Disney and Comcast, which are in the mid-$150 billion range.
So far, the tech giants haven't made big bets on the kind of content and distribution assets that are in Hollywood's wheelhouse, pursuing a route of acquiring executive talent instead of a wholesale studio acquisition. Netflix, Apple and Amazon have created studio capabilities in-house, says Greg Portell, lead partner in A.T. Kearney's communications, media and technology practice. And “there's very little advantage they would get from owning a studio” unless they were aiming to lock up rights to a library of content. “It's a freelancer industry,” they add.
Netflix has made only one acquisition in its 20-year history: Millarworld, a comic-book publisher whose franchises include “Kingsman” and “Kick-Ass.” The streamer paid $60 million-$80 million for the outfit, sources familiar with the pact say — hardly a bet-the-company move. On the other hand, Netflix has fashioned a string of lucrative overall development deals with big-name talent like Shonda Rhimes and Ryan Murphy. “That's arguably more efficient for them than buying a traditional media company or studio,” Uva says.
Last week Netflix chief content officer Ted Sarandos told investors the company is open to deals, but indicated those would be relatively bite-size, not massive. “In terms of using M&A to acquire intellectual property, it could be a very useful tool,” they said during a Q&A discussing Netflix's quarterly results.
Apple, with a market cap approaching nearly $1 trillion, is one of the few entities on the planet that could reasonably absorb Disney or another major media company. While the dark cloud of the disastrous AOL-Time Warner merger nearly 20 years ago has kept the two worlds at arm's length from a corporate M&A perspective, some believe a tech powerhouse will inevitably pounce in a big way.
“I expect a challenge coming out of Silicon Valley,” says Kevin Westcott, Deloitte's U.S. media and entertainment leader. “Those players already have a mass audience. What they're missing is exclusive content.”
Among Hollywood's old guard, there's a new itch to scoop up opportunities before they become a building block for a well-heeled competitor. Lisbeth Barron, the veteran investment banker who heads Barron International Group, is juggling more than a dozen transactions involving content providers.
“There aren't that many pure-play content companies of quality left to buy right now,” Barron says. “If the big tech companies actually started to get more aggressive in this sector, there would be very little remaining for the big studios to acquire.”
On top of the pressure generated by the rise of the FAANG sector, media giants are grappling with Wall Street's high expectations. “Public shareholders are hungry for more and more growth now more than ever,” says Barron. “They have gotten spoiled by the success of the stock market. It's going to be very difficult for media companies to deliver that growth organically. They have to look for other ways — hence the accelerating pickup in M&A.”
There's no question that Hollywood is in for a major realignment. But, says Westcott, “It's not a five-alarm fire.” They say the majors and the mini-majors have figured out how to make content people want, which makes them very valuable in a world in which there's fierce competition for high-quality entertainment. The question, says Westcott, “is what platform that goes to and how it gets delivered.”
A six-hour 30 for 30 series on the Vegas Golden Knights' Stanley Cup run wouldn't even give us all the answers.
Really, could anything give us a full understanding of the Golden Knights' impossible season?
Now three wins away from the Stanley Cup, Vegas is poised to complete the most perplexing story in NHL history. It might even be the most compelling story in North American sports. There's no other team in the North American major leagues that has come close to achieving what Vegas has in their first year of existence.
It's a story even Hollywood would have trouble believing. But it's not done yet. #VegasBorn #StanleyCup pic.twitter.com/7DQuxpY4MH — NHL (@NHL) May 28, 2018
From the first drop of the puck in October, Vegas has bewildered everyone with a full and complete effort from every single player. When you watch Vegas, you become mesmerized by just how hard they work every shift. Nobody on that team quits, no matter what the score is.
This was a team that everyone expected to flop with a middling roster full of cast-offs. With the right mix of players and an up-tempo style of play, Vegas now looks near unbeatable.
The Vegas Buzz Word: Tenacious
With a team this tenacious, it's a surprise that they don't have Jack Black and Kyle Gass performing during the intermissions.
You could describe this Golden Knights team in a few different ways. What stands out with this group most though is their tenacious style of play. They're already one of the fastest teams in the NHL, and their forwards are always buzzing around the net.
Quantifying tenacity-per-60 may be out of the question, but it can be summed up as simply as this. Vegas shows no quit. No matter what the score is, no matter what the situation is, Vegas plays like it's their franchise's last game every time they're on the ice.
In the Conference Final, Vegas made a superior Winnipeg Jets team look overwhelmed. After losing Game 1 of that series, Vegas never trailed over the next four games. They came out flying against the Jets, making one of the most talented teams in the league look slow and mundane.
Even when Winnipeg pushed back, Vegas wouldn't budge an inch. They also got more consistent play top to bottom throughout the lineup. Out of the top 20 players in scoring chances for per-60 in the Conference Finals, seven were from Vegas. Only two players from Winnipeg cracked that list.
When the games mattered the most, more players from Vegas showed up. They were tenacious, hard on the forecheck, and imposed their will on a favoured Jets team. Even in Game 1 of the Stanley Cup Final, Vegas overcame every deficit and obstacle presented to them.
In short, nothing changed with this team between their first game in October and Game One of the Stanley Cup Final.
Golden Knights All Have Something to Prove
There's no concrete answer to explain Vegas's sheer tenacity and success, but there's one prevalent theory that makes sense.
The majority of Vegas's expansion draft selections were comprised of players who had something to prove. It's something that nearly every player on that roster had in common.
It starts with the top line of Reilly Smith, Jon Marchessault, and William Karlsson. All three of those players were underused and undervalued in their former organizations. Their play in Vegas was resemblant of players who had a fire lit underneath their feet.
How about castoff David Perron, who's on their fifth team in four seasons? Not only has they found a home, but they set a career-high in points.
Erik Haula is another great example. In Minnesota, their ceiling was a third-line player. They destroyed that notion by posting 55 points with the Golden Knights. There's also Game 1 hero Tomas Nosek, who was buried in the Detroit Red Wings organization. How do they look now after scoring a game-winning goal in the Stanley Cup Final?
Almost all of the team's defencemen and goaltenders share a similar story. Guess what? Almost every single player on the Golden Knights had a career year statistically.
It's all culminated to create the perfect storm in Vegas. Under the beating desert sun, this collection of misfits is now poised to create history in the unlikeliest of places. At the same time, everyone watching this team make history must have the same thought creeping into their mind.
Never underestimate the power of the misfits.

As robots gain citizenship and potential personhood in parts of the world, it's appropriate to consider whether they should also have rights.
So argues Northeastern professor Woodrow Hartzog, whose research focuses in part on robotics and automated technologies.
“It's difficult to say we've reached the point where robots are completely self-sentient and self-aware; that they're self-sufficient without the input of people,” said Hartzog, who holds joint appointments in the School of Law and the College of Computer and Information Science at Northeastern. “But the question of whether they should have rights is a really interesting one that often gets stretched in considering situations where we might not normally use the word ‘rights.'”
In Hartzog's consideration of the question, granting robots negative rights—rights that permit or oblige inaction—resonates.
They cited research by Kate Darling, a research specialist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, that indicates people relate more emotionally to anthropomorphized robots than those with fewer or no human qualities.
“When you think of it in that light, the question becomes, ‘Do we want to prohibit people from doing certain things to robots not because we want to protect the robot, but because of what violence to the robot does to us as human beings?'” Hartzog said.
In other words, while it may not be important to protect a human-like robot from a stabbing, someone stabbing a very human-like robot could have a negative impact on humanity. And in that light, Hartzog said, it would make sense to assign rights to robots.
There is another reason to consider assigning rights to robots, and that's to control the extent to which humans can be manipulated by them.
While we may not have reached the point of existing among sentient bots, we're getting closer, Hartzog said. Robots like Sophia, a humanoid robot that this year achieved citizenship in Saudi Arabia, put us on that path.
Sophia, a project of Hanson Robotics, has a human-like face modeled after Audrey Hepburn and utilizes advanced artificial intelligence that allows it to understand and respond to speech and express emotions.
“Sophia is an example of what's to come,” Hartzog said. “She seems to be living in that area where we might say the full impact of anthropomorphism might not be realized, but we're headed there. She's far enough along that we should be thinking now about rules regarding how we should treat robots as well as the boundaries of how robots will be able to relate to us.”
The robot occupies the space Hartzog and others in computer science identified as the “uncanny valley.” That is, it is eerily similar to a human, but not close enough to feel natural. “Close, but slightly off-putting,” Hartzog said.
In considering the implications of human and robot interactions, then, we might be better off imagining a cute, but decidedly inhuman form. Think of the main character in the Disney movie Wall-E, Hartzog said, or a cuter version of the vacuuming robot Roomba.
They considered a thought experiment: Imagine having a Roomba that was equipped with AI assistance along the lines of Amazon's Alexa or Apple's Siri. Imagine it was conditioned to form a relationship with its owner, to make jokes, to say hello, to ask about one's day.
“I would come to really have a great amount of affection for this Roomba,” Hartzog said. “Then imagine one day my Roomba starts coughing, sputtering, choking, one wheel has stopped working, and it limps up to me and says, ‘Father, if you don't buy me an upgrade, I'll die.'
“If that were to happen, is that unfairly manipulating people based on our attachment to human-like robots?” Hartzog asked.
It's a question that asks us to confront the limits of our compassion, and one the law has yet to grapple with, they said.
What's more, Hartzog's fictional scenario isn't so far afield.
“Home-care robots are going to be given a lot of access to our most intimate areas of life,” they said. “When robots get to the point where we trust them and we're friends with them, what are the articulable boundaries for what a robot we're emotionally invested in is allowed to do?”
Hartzog said that with the introduction of virtual assistants like Siri and Alexa, “we're halfway there right now.”
Editor's Note: This story is a republication of the original story “SHSU answers call to healthcare needs in Texas” from Jan. 31. Following vocal concerns from the Sam Houston State University Office of Communications, we pulled down the article for a 48-hour review. The editorial staff conducted an extensive review in conjunction with The Houstonian's faculty adviser Dr. Marcus Funk, Department of Mass Communication Chair Dr. Jean Bodon and Dean of the College of Fine Arts and Mass Communication, Dr. Ronald Shields.
The Houstonian remains confident in its reporting. Conversations with the Office of Communications and other university officials have indicated that the publication of this article may influence the future of the proposed College of Osteopathic Medicine. With that in mind, it is incumbent upon The Houstonian to be as transparent as possible regarding its sources and information.
All quotations were derived from one-on-one conversations and/or emails with university staff including University Spokeswoman Emily Binetti and Dean of the proposed College of Osteopathic Medicine Dr. Charles Henley. Information regarding the college's proposed opening date was confirmed by the program's official website, http://www.shsu.edu/campaign/college-of-osteopathic-medicine.html; the page has since been removed as of 1 p.m. on Feb. 2. We have included screenshots of the website from 5 p.m. Feb. 1 where the original information was available as well as a second screenshot following the page's removal.
The Houstonian regrets its factual inaccuracies in the photo caption of the print edition of this story in its Jan. 31 issue, which erroneously stated the College of Osteopathic Medicine was already approved. We also appreciate commentary from university officials that the lead sentence may have been ambiguous, and The Houstonian would like to clarify that the proposed College of Osteopathic Medicine is still under review.
The Houstonian is republishing its original article without changes. Stay up-to-date with The Houstonian for the latest information.
Sam Houston State University is inching closer to establishing a college of osteopathic medicine, scheduled to open in Fall 2020. SHSU has secured a location in Conroe's Grand Central Park, and each class will have 150 students and will have a capacity of 600 students.
“The facility will be built on land donated to the university,” University Spokeswoman Emily Binetti said. “The programming for the building is underway. We are also in the process of hiring additional staff and faculty.”
Osteopathic medicine uses modern medicine while also incorporating hands-on diagnosis and treatment through a system known as osteopathic manipulative medicine, according to the American Association of Colleges of Osteopathic Medicine.
According to Dr. Charles Henley, dean of the college of osteopathic medicine, Houston is home to some of the best hospitals and medical research facilities in the world; the other 80 percent of Texas is medically underserved and predominantly rural. A medical school in Houston cannot adequately serve the people in East Texas towns like Crockett, Lufkin, Centerville and countless others.
The SHSU Osteopathic Medicine program is designed to focus on the primary care needs of those rural and underserved Texans, which follows the university motto “a measure of life is its service.” It will be a four-year, doctoral program that will consist of classroom training during the first two years followed by student rotations in medicine, surgery and women's health.
SHSU conducted a regional needs assessment in 2013 for an overall health sciences strategic plan where two critical needs were identified: nurses and primary health physicians. The university then responded by doubling its already existent nursing program and initiating a study on how to best address the widening primary care gap, which Binetti said is predominantly in rural regions of Texas.
“This is what Sam Houston State University does,” Henley said. “It's what we've always done since our founding as a teachers college. We identify a real need, build a corresponding program, educate the next generation of professionals and return them to the communities where they come from— where they are needed most.”
Four out of every five counties in Texas are designated as medically underserved and 177 counties out of 254 are classified as rural. A recent national report ranked Texas 36 out of 47 states for rural health care and assigned a “D-minus” to the state because of “low access to care, poor physical health and high mortality rates from heart disease and stroke.”
Henley said that recruitment will focus on students from rural and underserved areas to help build a pipeline of qualified medical students who are more likely to return to their communities, benefitting those people living in serviced areas. The university is also partnering with new teaching hospitals and medical facilities in the East Texas region to support the clinical training of 150 students.
“The proposed College of Osteopathic Medicine is affiliating with hospitals in rural areas to establish clerkship training programs,” Henley said. “There are numerous opportunities for interdisciplinary collaboration between academic and research areas.”
The Texas State University System Board of Regents passed a motion for full approval to develop the proposed osteopathic medicine program in August 2017. According to Henley, the osteopathic medicine degree at SHSU is under review by the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board, and the next steps include a pre-accreditation site visit by the Commission on Osteopathic College Accreditation and the completion of a self-study for provisional accreditation.
JERUSALEM -- In an embarrassment to the Israeli government, only five of 11 NFL players have arrived on a sponsored trip aimed at improving the country's image.
The ministry for strategic affairs and public diplomacy issued an press release after the Super Bowl boasting that the visit would bring "influencers" who would serve as "goodwill ambassadors" when they returned home.
The announcement led Seattle Seahawks defense lineman Michael Bennett to pull out. They accused the government of trying to use them for PR purposes and cited sympathy for the Palestinians.
Freedom for all A photo posted by Michael Bennett (@mosesbread72) on Feb 10, 2017 at 5:27pm PST
Several others players followed suit, including Bennett's brother, New England Patriots tight end Martellus Bennett, who retweeted their brother's letter.
Rambam hospital spokesperson David Ratner said Wednesday that only five players arrived for a planned visit to the hospital. The ministry declined to comment.
According to the Times of Israel, the five players that went on the trip were: Arizona Cardinals defensive end Calais Campbell, Oakland Raiders defensive tackle Dan Williams, New Orleans Saints defensive end Cameron Jordan, Tennessee Titans tight end Delanie Walker and Philadelphia Eagles linebacker Mychal Kendricks.
The players besides the Bennetts that were scheduled to appear but didn't make the trip were: Seattle Seahawks defensive end Cliff Avril, Miami Dolphins wide receiver Kenny Stills, San Francisco 49ers running back Carlos Hyde and Denver Broncos running back Justin Forsett. Retired NFL linebacker Kirk Morrison also was originally scheduled to appear.
Kendricks and Jordan have posted pictures and video on social media from their visit.

The weekend snowfall left more than just a blanket of snow on the ground.
It also left several cars in disrepair at towing companies across Mid-Michigan.
"It was more than double the normal Saturday for us," said Bill Giorgis, owner of Mike's Wrecker Service in Saginaw.
Giorgis said the increase in business came as no surprise, but the lack of severe accidents did.
"A lot of them are fender benders because people are going slower. You know it is snowy and slippery, but some of the roads are almost ice after they get a little packed down," Giorgis said.
They want to remind drivers if you see a tow truck doing it's job, take it slow - especially in the snow.
"You know, we ask that people slow down. Especially if they see emergency warning lights and you know, move over a lane and give us some courtesy," Giorgis said.
They said no matter the damage, whether it's major or minor, you need to call your insurance agent right away.
"To get the process started. Sometimes people won't call for a couple of days and you know, each day delays the process either for them getting into a rental car or getting their vehicle repaired or getting their vehicle totaled and then paid," Giorgis said.

MANCHESTER, England (Reuters) - Manchester City now have an 11-point lead at the top of the Premier League, after a record 14th straight win in a single season, but Sunday's derby showed the numbers cannot do full justice to the superiority of Pep Guardiola's side.

The precision of their passing was perhaps not at its optimum at a freezing, snowy Old Trafford but City came to the home of their biggest rivals -- in the title race and in terms of local pride -- and did it the Guardiola way.
“People said we couldn't play the way we did in Barcelona in England but it is possible and we did it,” the former Barça boss said after the 2-1 victory.
Indeed it was the familiar approach of slick movement, clever passing, intelligent combination and positional rotation that has been the hallmark of Guardiola's career at Barça and Bayern Munich.
It was, though, also a performance that had the other necessary ingredients for success in the high-octane Premier League -- physicality, aggression and the ability to compete hard against determined opponents.
This City team were never more than a work in progress last year, in a campaign where they finished 15 points behind champions Chelsea.
This time, with a more solid defence and even more options in attack, they are stronger on paper and also have been shaped by the experience of fighting for results until late in games, against teams such as West Ham and Huddersfield.
Guardiola rarely puts down their opponents but after a series of jibes from their counterpart Jose Mourinho, before and after the game, they dropped their usual diplomacy.

“We won because we were better. We were better in all departments,” they said.
And they were right.

In the first half especially, United struggled to keep the ball, allowing City to enjoy the kind of long spells of possession that they relish.
At the back, United were stretched and exposed by the constant movement of Raheem Sterling and Leroy Sané, while they conceded two goals from set-pieces.
While City may not have been at their absolute sharpest in attack, they were certainly more dangerous than United with Romelu Lukaku continuing their struggles against top teams and wide men Anthony Martial and Marcus Rashford rarely able to get the space to put City on the back foot.
Kevin De Bruyne did not run riot, as they have done several times this season, but City still looked the more commanding in the centre of midfield.
The title race is not, as Guardiola was right to note, decided in December but it is not only the maths that favour the blue half of Manchester.
City look like champions elect and it will take something extraordinary and unexpected to stop them raising the trophy in May.
Pakistan has always managed to find a saviour when most needed.
Doctor Ruth Pfau, who recently passed away, was Pakistan's own Mother Teresa.
They were instrumental in looking after one of the most marginalised segment of our country, those suffering from leprosy.
Sister Doctor Ruth Katherina Martha Pfau was born in Leipzig, Germany's tenth most populous city, on September 9, 1929 but their altruistic nature compelled their heart to settle in Pakistan.
Post-World War II, the soviet occupation of East Germany forced them and their family to escape to West Germany where they studied medicine at the University of Mainz during the 1950s.
Being a nun and a member of the “Society of Daughters of the Heart of Mary”, a Catholic order, they were sent to Southern India to further the cause of the Catholic Church.
Who would have thought that a mere visa complication would land Doctor Pfau in the Southern port city of Karachi and ultimately, lead Pakistan to become one of the first Asian countries to control the leprosy threat as declared by the World Health Organisation (WHO) in 1996.
It was in 1960, at the age of 31, when fate took them on their very first visit to the Lepers' Colony in Karachi behind I I Chundrigar Road (previously known as McLeod Road), that they decided to make the fight against leprosy their life's mission.
Them initial struggles began from a small room in the slums, subsequent non-stop positive efforts paved the way for the foundation of Marie Adelaide Leprosy Centre (MALC) in Karachi and later in all the four provinces of Pakistan including Gilgit-Baltistan.
MALC, after a couple of years, was transformed to the level of a proper hospital.
Patients across Pakistan and even neighbouring Afghanistan used to come to Doctor Pfau for treatment.
Perhaps the most fascinating aspect was the bond created between Sister Pfau and the patients they cured.
A glance at Madam Pfau's staff members reveals that the staff mostly consisted of their previously diseased patients.
Leprosy is a long-standing infectious disease cause by a bacterium (singular of bacteria): Mycobacterium leprae or Mycobacterium lepromatosis.
Also known as Hansen's Disease (HD), the telltale symptoms include the inability to feel pain due to nerve damage, weakness in muscles and loss of vision.
Injuries and wounds on the patient's extremities go unnoticed, thus setting the stage for infection and ultimately leading to loss of the affected limb.
Leprosy has long been associated with fear and dishonour.
“Leprostigma” or “Stigma of Leprosy” has ancient roots owing to the facial and bodily disfigurement which the disease inflicts on its victims.
In the Middle Ages (5th to 15th century), the Church in Western Europe labelled diseased individuals as “unclean” and patients were made to wear a bell to indicate their arrival.
In the 19th century, leprosy was thought to be linked to Sexually Transmitted Diseases (STDs) like syphilis.
The discrimination against leprosy victims sees no boundaries.
Matsuo Fujimoto, an unfortunate Japanese leprosy patient, was charged with murder and dynamite explosion.
The Japanese government that time used to openly discriminate against those suffering from leprosy.
In 1962, they were controversially declared guilty by the court and hanged.
Still today, a large population of lay people across the world consider leprosy an incurable, highly contagious disease, thus forcing the diseased and their families into isolation.
Doctor Ruth Pfau gave Pakistan's shunned leprosy community a home.
They dedicated more than half a century to eradicate all myths and stigmas associated with the disease.
Leprosy as a bacterial infection, requires a combination of two or three antibiotics (Rifampicin, Dapsone and/or Clofazimine).
This multidrug therapy for a period ranging from six months to a year helps achieve effective cure in the patients.
Contrary to common misconception leprosy is not highly contagious, in fact after the first month of receiving medication, the individual no longer remains infectious.
The disease spreads only when a healthy person comes in close and repeated contact with nose and mouth droplets of an untreated patient.
The path ahead for Doctor Pfau's national programme to eradicate leprosy now seems unclear.
With their departure, we have lost perhaps the only source of light for the few remaining leprosy patients in Pakistan.

Volunteers are knitting and crocheting red hats for babies born in February. (Source: Little Hats, Big Hearts)
Volunteers from around the country are joining the American Heart Association, in connection with The Children's Heart Foundation, to celebrate American Heart Month by knitting and crocheting red hats for babies born in February at participating hospitals.
The “Little Hats, Big Hearts” program, honors babies, moms, and heart-healthy lives in a very special way. Supporters are knitting and crocheting red hats to be given out to thousands of babies during American Heart Month in order to empower moms to live heart-healthy lives and to help their children do the same.
More than 40,000 babies are born with congenital heart defects, in the U.S., each year.
That's about 1 in 100 babies.
"Cardiac malformations are still the highest cause of infant deaths,” Dr. Eric Graham, MUSC's Chief of Pediatric Cardiology, said. “Particularly for children born with a congenital malformation. So there's a lot of research that still needs to be done to try and improve this because of the huge emotional and financial strain on families."
And trying to help relieve that strain is why 7-year-old Sophie Seagle has put their hands to work. Ashlie Seagle, Sophie's mom, said Sophie came home one day and had learned one of their friends was having a birthday for a sibling who they couldn't see because they were in Heaven.
Sophie, immediately, wanted to help.
“Her heart is enormous,” Ashlie said. “She is always thinking about other people."
The family came across a Facebook post about the “Little Hats, Big Hearts” program – and from there Sophie started knitting hats.
So far, Sophie has knitted four hats – but their goal is much more.
“I plan on doing this the rest of my life,” Sophie said.
Together, the American Heart Association is working to raise awareness, provide resources and inspire moms to take their family's heart health to heart while also raising awareness about Congenital Heart Defects.
If you knit or crochet and would like to participate in Little Hats, Big Hearts, please select your state, or the state nearest you, for more information on deadlines and where to send your hats. They are also accepting donations of yarn.
If you don't knit or crochet you can still make an impact with your financial support by making a donation.
To find out where to send finished hats, head to the website and select your state. The organization has a database of participating hospitals and points of contact across the country.

A 43-year-old Florida man has been arrested for stalking and attempting to kidnap Lana Del Rey.
The man, identified as Michael Hunt of Riverview, Florida, allegedly made several threats against Del Rey on their personal Facebook page. According to a press release issued by Orlando Police Department, detectives found the threats “credible” and took measures to locate Hunt. They were taken into custody on Friday evening, a block from Orlando's Amway Center, where Del Rey was performing. They were found in possession of a concert ticket and a knife.
Hunt is being held on charges of aggravated stalkers with a credible threat and attempted kidnapping with a weapon.
The first trailer for “Crazy Rich Asians” is here and it's as magnificent as you would expect from the movie's title.
Released on Monday, it introduces Constance Wu of “Fresh Off the Boat” as Rachel Chu — a woman who agrees to finally meet their boyfriend's family only to discover exactly why they haven't been the most forthcoming when it comes to sharing details about them. Starring opposite Wu is Henry Golding as boyfriend Nick Young.
As Kim Hennick and Mary Sist describe what they've been through with their house, their story begins to sound like a movie script. Part horror, part drama, part comedy, their adventure began back in 2007 when the couple bought an A-frame-roof, cottage-style house in Etobicoke. They took what they thought was every precaution before purchasing the four-bedroom, $448,000 home. They bought title insurance, hired a lawyer and a housing inspector and were five years away from paying off the mortgage. “It was renovated, it was beautiful,” says Hennick, 48, the director of branch development for The Printing House. “It was a big, entertaining house and that was the whole thing for us, we're very social people.” Hennick and Sist can talk, and occasionally laugh, about their ordeal now that it seems to be over with the construction of their new, custom, modular home they moved into a few months ago.

They describe how it all began, a few years after living in the home they first bought. “We started getting little leaks,” explains Hennick. “Then little electrical wonky things started happening here and there.” Finally, after drywall under their stairs began to bubble in 2014, they discovered water on the cement footing below. They went to the City of Toronto to pull the permits from the previous owner's renovation and were shocked to learn the permits had never been closed.
“We should have never been able to buy the house!” says Hennick. Since the housing inspector had included a paragraph in their report noting it was a renovation and permits should be pulled to guarantee everything was done properly, the couple's title insurance was null and void. Hennick and Sist hired tradespeople to investigate further — and more problems arose. The basement, which had been dug out and expanded during the previous renovation, didn't have the proper footings to match the original. The master bedroom at the front of the house was full of mould. The electrical work needed replacing and some of their plumbing was installed backwards. Bleeding money, they had to make some big decisions. And fast. “We were lucky that we could go to the bank and say ‘OK, here's the situation, we're going to do something,' ” says Sist, 55, the senior manager of training and development at Mr. Lube Canada. Ultimately, they decided to say goodbye to their house. “We paid $450,000 to knock it down and start fresh. All because the inspector put in that one paragraph,” adds Hennick. “We loved that house! We didn't want to tear it down. It was perfect for us.” They decided to install a modular home, instead, which came with an easier-to-swallow six-to-eight-week timeline compare to the minimum six months for a rebuild. “We had this giant demolition party,” says Hennick of their July, 2016 move-out and teardown. “We were throwing hammers at the wall! We had some fun along the way. It wasn't all horrible.” During the demolition, the foundation which Hennick and Sist had just spent $50,000 to fix, was irreparably damaged. They were forced to lay a whole new foundation, a months-long delay.

Their two-storey modern home — which they affectionally call their Lego home — was sourced from iModular Homes in Aylmer, Ont., and arrived in six pieces on three flatbeds from Indiana. Six men put together the three-bedroom house over just eight hours and gave the students at the school across the street a total shock in the process. “The kids go in from recess, and they come out and there's a house there!” laughs Hennick. The entire 1,750-square-foot modular house — with almost everything already in it — cost $385,000.

The plumbing and electrical had to be installed afterwards, and they hired a separate contractor to finish the basement, increasing their total space to the total 2,850 square feet. The silver lining to the disastrous experience is that couple loves their new home more than the last. “It's 100 per cent better!” says Hennick. As well as entertaining, the couple love to travel and highlighted some of their favourite destinations while decorating. They used custom wall decor from The Printing House to transform their basement into an Irish pub, complete with pool table and big-screen TV. A piazza mural in their dining room brings back memories of Italy. On their back deck, they can relive apres-ski while hot-tubbing against a mural backdrop of the Rockies. They also incorporated 3-D printing into their home's decor.

Upstairs, their master-bedroom sanctuary features a barn door sourced from a local farm outside of Aylmer which was built in the 1830s. A large walk-in closet, ensuite bathroom and sitting area take up the entire floor with a chimney-free fireplace they scored at Costco for $250 adding to the cosy, tranquil feel of the space. When guests come to stay with the couple, they have their own private retreat in the basement, with two additional bedrooms and a bathroom. “I like cooking, so I love this compared to the other place,” says Sist, leaning against the 10-foot Corian kitchen island with sit-up bar across from their five-burner gas stove. “We can be the hub again. We can bring people together!” adds Hennick.

St. Mary's College Dehiwala 100 years
BY TREVINE RODRIGO
Tucked away just outside the limits of Colombo are St. Mary's College Dehiwela a little school nestled behind St. Mary's church on Galle Road that has produced some of the country's most outstanding sportsmen, and a few academics as well.
Although not regarded among the elite, the school commanded tremendous respect particularly on the sporting fields of Sri Lanka during the 1960's and ‘70's so much so that as its 100th year celebrations roll on, many people from all walks of life still reflect with awe and open admiration, some of those from St. Mary's who represented their country with dignity.
It somehow reflects on their early grounding and perhaps the lyrics of the school song which contain the words, “Our hearts and hands and lives we'll give, for our dear land”.
Boxing always comes foremost to mind when you talk of the boys from St. Mary's because they produced the best boxers of the late ‘60's and early ‘70's in a dominant era in schools for the Marians as they were known. St. Mary's in those glory days were coached by the late and great Joe Rodrigo, a man well ahead of their time in coaching, and later Douglas Pereira and schoolmaster E.L De Souza, dominating the plum of schools boxing, the all island schools Stubbs Shield championships, the Junior championships and Novices and Intermediate meets and the traditional Colombo versus Outstation schools which were the leading encounters planned annually by the Amateur Boxing Association (ABA) of Sri Lanka, and were the envy of all the elite schools in the country for their undisputed superiority in the sport. They even took it up to the best and were very much in the forefront of inter club boxing which featured the Defense Services and the cream of boxers from around the country.
During that era where Colombo schools dominated most sport, this was possibly the only sport that the outstation boys beat the pants off the affluent Colombo lads.
In fact, the Marians won a hat-trick of Stubbs Shield trophies before being surprised in their fourth attempt in 1974 when the gap between themselves and the other schools closed dramatically to see them go down to Zahira College Maradana in their bid to emulate Royal College as the only school in the history of boxing to win four consecutive Stubbs shield championships as way back as in 1917. A string of upsets which saw some of their stars go down to lesser known opponents saw them lose their grip on a trophy they had come to call their own.
Names such as Chavo, Millon and Brindley De Kauwe, Bernard and Reginald De Zilva, Douglas Pereira, Ernest, Hans and Bunty Van Cuylenberg, Godfrey and Adrian Van Heer, Andre Vanderwert, Lucian Crozier, Lucian Jansz, Adrian Foulstone, Bandula Ratnapala, Vasantha Perera, Nigel Jansen, Terry Varney, Elsworth Felsianes, Raymond Rodrigo, M.L Peiris, Wendall Mack and Milroy Byrde just to name a few,many of them now living here in Australia, and some spanning the globe, are names that most sport fans in Sri Lanka remember for their polished pugilistic skills that brought fame to college and country.
Out of the above-named bunch, Chavo De Kauwe, Douglas Pereira, Hans VanCyulenberg and Bernard De Zilwa were stand outs for their school and country being regularly selected to fight in international competitions. De Kauwe, Pereira and VanCulenberg were Sri Lanka's aspirants at the Asian Games as well.
De Kauwe was a household name in Sri Lanka boxing circles being the only man to win Silver at the Asian Championships in Thailand and according to reports from Bangkok was robbed of Gold due to partisan judges favouring the host nation's fighter. They were described by a Thai journalist as a “Typewriter puncher” for their rat-a-tat fist speed and quicksilver footwork.
Outside of boxing, the school also excelled at wrestling, producing some of the best in the land notably national champions Sunil Fernando, Merry and Noble George, while they were no slouches at Rugby Union, Cricket and Basketball being in the forefront during their heyday. They were deprived of more glory at the time due the discriminatory sporting structure that relegated some schools to a lower rung an aspect that has now been justly addressed and rectified in Sri Lanka sport much to the benefit of the country.
One of the most talented Marians not to have played for Sri Lanka was brilliant cricketer Bernard Rulach, who had the credentials but not the “right” school background to warrant their place to play for their country. Anyone who disputes that is living in denial, as I distinctly remember them pushing for national selection and being given the chance to prove themselves and when they did well in the “Trials” was still mysteriously overlooked. Rulach would have been a modern day hero of world cricket because their crash and bash approach to the game would have put them in the forefront of the new style of the game particularly the Twenty20 format. They were in the Sanath Jayasuriya mould.
We would not have had the joy of seeing a Sanath Jayasuriya, Marvan Atapattu, Lasith Malinga, or Ajantha Mendis if not for the sensible turnaround in thinking in modern day Sri Lanka.
Many Marians however, played rugby and cricket at club and defence forces level after leaving school rubbing shoulders and excelling with the best players in the land. Another talent associated with the boys from St. Mary's is music with some of the top notch musicians in Sri Lanka produced by the school. The school boasted one of the best choirs that were prominent at inter-school competitions in the country. They were ably coached by two of the best voices in the land Estelle and Douglas de Neise.
Tyronne De Kauwe, brothers, Trevine, Dion and Chavo, Francis Porrit and Merry George and a few others also played “Sara” cricket during different stages of their lives instilling the Marian presence at the top level of domestic cricket in Sri Lanka.
After years of writing on schools, people, events and achievements in Sri Lanka's highly diverse society, it gives me an inner glow to write about my old school in which I enjoyed some of the best and most memorable days of my life. Many of those names mentioned above were from my era, some classmates, and others who I played sport with, and our bond is still as strong as it was when we were little men.
The Old Boys Union (OBU) of St. Mary's in Australia are organizing a gala dinner dance to celebrate 100 years of the College's history on November 22 at Good Shepherd Hall in Glen Waverly and part of the proceeds from the function will be channeled to the school to help in its badly needed upgrade and to provide better facilities for the students and teaching staff.
"Gov. Kay Ivey gave nearly $1 million of taxpayers' money to a liberal activist organization that promotes alternative lifestyles and transgenderism."
Scott Dawson, an evangelical minister running for governor in Alabama, accused the incumbent of funnelling taxpayer dollars to a controversial cause.
"It's been uncovered that Gov. Kay Ivey gave nearly $1 million of taxpayers' money to a liberal activist organization that promotes alternative lifestyles and transgenderism," Dawson's campaign wrote in a press release.
The organization in question is Free2Be, a non-profit that provides counseling services to LGBTQ victims of domestic violence and bullying in Alabama.
The nonprofit has been the subject of heavy scrutiny in Alabama, but for financial reasons, not political ones.
After the group's founder, James Robinson, left the group in January, the board of directors determined that Free2Be did not have the financial stability to continue. The group shuttered its doors after a state agency found they had failed to pay payroll taxes to the IRS.
Dawson's campaign pointed us to a 2012 YouTube video as evidence Free2be is a "liberal activist organization that promotes alternative lifestyles and transgenderism."
The video didn't suggest the organization aimed to change anyone's sexual orientation or gender identity. Neither do the group's public statements. Instead, Robinson railed against messages of hate from teachers, parents and churches towards LGBTQ teens.
Federal grants
So what taxpayer funding did the group receive until they landed in hot water?
Dawson's campaign overshot the target by a few hundred thousand dollars with their $1 million figure.
The campaign calculated that Free2Be received $762,042.37 in federal grants since Ivey assumed office in April 2017, using data from Alabama's Finance Department.
But the Alabama Department of Economic and Community Affairs, which reviews grant applications and presents funding recommendations to the governor's office for approval, announces grants on an annual basis. Ivey's administration was responsible for approving $800,000 in grants for fiscal year 2018, which began in October 2017.
Of that total, $727,410 came from the Victims of Crime Act, which is part of the U.S. Department of Justice, and $49,915 from the federal Family Violence Prevention and Services Act.
The grants refunded expenses incurred by the organization. Those payments stopped in late March, when Free2Be shut down, and added up to $422,680.37.
In fiscal year 2018, the state awarded $23.5 million in Victims of Crime Act grants to 79 nonprofit or governmental agencies across Alabama, said Department of Economic and Community Affairs spokesperson Josh Carples. Free2Be was one of those recipients.
The law requires that 10 percent of Victims of Crime Act grant funding go to underserved victims of violent crime each year. The agency started to look for LGBTQ grant recipients in 2013, after a program specialist noticed the agency was not funding any providers that serviced that community. Because it qualified as underserved, the specialist suggested the agency begin LGBTQ outreach.
The following year, Free2Be was the only Victims of Crime Act applicant serving the LGBTQ population, and the agency approved their grant request.
Taxpayer dollars
Ivey's campaign argued that the grants were not funded by taxpayer dollars, but by federal criminal fees.
The Office for Victims of Crime's website uses a similar distinction as Ivey in describing these grants: "The Fund is financed by fines and penalties paid by convicted federal offenders, not from tax dollars."
But Matt Gardner, senior fellow at the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, said there is a distinction between tax dollars and taxpayer dollars.
"User fees are, technically, not ‘tax dollars' in that they are not the product of our tax system," Gardner said. "But the broader claim that these are not ‘taxpayer dollars' doesn't seem right. When we pay the $20 entrance fee to visit a national park, we're not paying a tax. But most people would say that $20 is ‘taxpayer dollars' in that the government collected it from people, and will spend it on some public services."
Gardner likened a $20 park fee to the fines and penalties paid by federal offenders.
Susan Pace Hamill, a professor at the University of Alabama School of Law, agreed.
"Criminal fines and forfeitures are not typical taxes, but resemble typical taxes because they represent dollars collected involuntarily and are used for some public purpose," Hamill said.
Our ruling
Dawson said, "It's been uncovered that Gov. Kay Ivey gave nearly $1 million of taxpayers' money to a liberal activist organization that promotes alternative lifestyles and transgenderism."
The organization in question is Free2Be, a victims resources nonprofit that serviced the LGBTQ community. Dawson distorted the organization's purpose, which was to support LGBTQ victims of domestic violence and bullying in Alabama, not to change anyone's gender identity or sexual orientation.
The Ivey administration approved almost $800,000 in grants to Free2Be in order to meet a federal grant quota for underserved communities. But the group did not receive the full amount before it closed in March; it received a little more than half of that funding.
The statement has an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate this statement Mostly False.
Jan Naszewski's New Europe Film Sales has signed international sales rights on the ”The County”, the new feature by Icelandic director Grímur Hákonarson whose ”Rams” (”Hrutar”), sold by NEFS, won the Un Certain Regard prize at the Cannes Festival, among another 29 awards, including 11 Eddas – Iceland's national film prizes.
Produced by Iceland's Netop Films, the company behind ”Rams” and Hafsteinn Gunnar Sigurdsson's ”Under the Tree,” “The County” follows Inga, a middle aged cow farmer, loses their husband in a car accident, they must stand on their own two feet. They start a new life on their own terms and in the process, tries to transform the community in which they live.”
With Arndís Hrönn Egilsdóttir in the lead, Netop Films producer Grímar Jónsson will produce the project with Denmark's Profile Pictures and France's Haut et Court; the film will be ready in January 2019.
“The County” is just the latest Scandinavian movie to join the sales slate of New Europe Film Sales which since Poland's Naszweski launched it in 2010, has handled a large number of films from Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway and Sweden at the international markets.
“Nordic filmmakers are excellent storytellers with a sense of humor and great taste,” said NEFS CEO Naszewski.
At the Norwegian International Film Festival in Haugesund, which runs Aug. 19-25, NEFS will screen two more Nordic films, including Icelandic director Hlynur Pálmason's feature debut “Winter Brothers” (”Vinterbrødre”), which last week won three awards at Switzerland's Locarno Festival: the Best actor for Danish lead Elliott Crosset Hove, the Europa Cinemas Label and the Junior Jury's First Prize.
On show at Haugesund's Nordic Focus and scripted by Pálmason, the film is produced by Julie Waltersdorph Hansen for Copenhagen's Masterplan Pictures. It follows two brothers who work at a chalk-pit mine in Denmark, their routines, habits, rituals and a violent feud that erupts between them and another family in what the director describes as ”a tale of a lack of love, an odyssey set in a working-class environment during a cold winter.”
In the New Nordic Films market program, New Europe Film Sales will launch Icelandic director Hafsteinn Gunnar Sigurdsson's ”Under the Tree” (”Undir trénu”), their third feature, which has been selected for the Horizons section at Venice Festival. It has already been sold to China (Times Vision), France (Bac Films) and Scandinavia (Scanbox).
Scripted by Sigurdsson and Huldar Breidfjörd, their co-writer on 2014's award-winning ”Paris of the North” (”París norðursins”) starring Steinþór Hróar Steinþórsson, “Under the Tree” tells the story of Atli, who is thrown out by their fiancée and is no longer allowed to see their four-year-old daughter. While fighting for custody, a bitter dispute with neighbors about a big and beautiful tree intensifies.
The former head of Poland's largest film industry event, Wroclaw's T-Mobile New Horizons International Film Festival, Naszewski originally set up New Europe Film Sales as a sales company for short films. But they gradually moved into features. The company's first milestone was ”Rams.”
”We work with emerging talent which we nurture, and we have a strong focus on Scandinavia,” Naszewski concluded.

WASHINGTON >> A top aide to President Donald Trump suggested that special counsel Robert Mueller is biased even as the White House worked to end a day of speculation over whether the president is considering firing the head of the Russia probe.
Kellyanne Conway, a top adviser to the president, tweeted a report citing a Federal Election Commission report that states Muellers team includes big Democrat donors. Some maxed out, none wanted Trump to be POTUS.
Them tweet, late Tuesday, ended a day in which the White House said the president has no intention of firing Mueller.

That statement was unlikely to quell criticism of Mueller from some of Trumps the closest allies  including one of their sons. They have begun questioning whether Muellers wide-ranging investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election is becoming too political.
The effort to muddy the waters surrounding the investigation is coming amid growing White House concern that the probe could detract from the presidents agenda for months or years to come. Senators on Tuesday questioned both Attorney General Jeff Sessions and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein on how the inquiry is being handled.
Until now, Mueller had drawn widespread praise from Republicans and Democrats alike. Trump, who isnt typically shy about leveling criticism, especially on Twitter, hasnt commented on the longtime former FBI director. And leading Republican legislators on Tuesday waved off the idea of firing Mueller, with House Speaker Paul Ryan saying that their advice was to let Robert Mueller do their job and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell voicing confidence in the special counsel.
But expressions of discontent with Mueller are bubbling up nonetheless.
Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich led one line of attack with a tweet that said Republicans are delusional if they think the special counsel is going to be fair. They added that fundraising records show some of the lawyers whom Mueller selected for their team have contributed to Democrats.
It makes sense to point out any level of bias, to highlight any biases inherent in Mueller and this probe in order to force them to be transparent, Gingrich said. They said Trump had called them Monday night and the two discussed Gingrichs concerns about the probe.
Tuesday morning, Trump supporter Ari Fleischer, who served as President George W. Bushs press secretary, again highlighted the issue of Muellers probe being handled by attorneys who have donated mostly to Democrats, a message that Donald Trump Jr. quickly retweeted to their own 1.7 million followers.
Peter Carr, a spokesperson for Mueller, declined to comment on the issues Gingrich and others have raised. In general, it is impermissible to ask prospective government hires about their political leanings, including whether theyve made donations.
Both Fleischer and Gingrich had previously vouched for the character and integrity of Mueller, who was appointed FBI director by Bush and whose term was extended an extra two years by Democratic President Barack Obama.
Anxiety about the probe  and fresh concerns about the political leanings of some of the attorneys involved  is percolating in the West Wing of the White House.
Chris Ruddy, a Trump friend and the CEO of the conservative website Newsmax, raised the possibility of the president considering terminating Mueller, a potentially explosive option.
White House officials said late Monday that Ruddy was at the Executive Mansion that day, but said they hadnt met with the president and never spoke with them about the issue.
Still, it took until Tuesday night for the White House to actually dispute Ruddys suspicion.
On Trumps plane ride home after a trip to Wisconsin, Sarah Huckabee Sanders told reporters they has no intention of firing Mueller, even though they maintained that the president has the right to.
A person close to Trumps legal team also said earlier Tuesday that there have been no discussions about firing Mueller. The person spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss private conversations.
But Ruddy opened a new line of questions about Muellers impartiality  the fact that Trump had considered Mueller for the FBI directors job before they were named special counsel.
Trump interviewed Mueller for the directors position days before Rosenstein picked Mueller as special counsel for the Russia probe, Sanders confirmed Tuesday. The interview was first reported by PBS.
Trump has repeatedly denied colluding with Russia during the presidential campaign, and Comey and others have testified that there is no evidence to the contrary. Still, Gingrich said any special counsel with an agenda can all of the sudden find something procedural and technical to latch onto.
With few exceptions, Trumps allies are urging them not to move to dismiss Mueller, which would be both politically and technically complicated. Rosenstein would be the one to fire Mueller, which they repeatedly assured senators Tuesday they would not consider without good cause.
Rosenstein is charged with Muellers fate because Attorney General Jeff Sessions recused themselves from all matters having to do with the Trump-Russia investigation. Sessions told senators on Tuesday that hed recused themselves because they were part of Trumps campaign.
Gingrich and Ruddy said it would be a mistake for Trump to remove Mueller, although both said they see the probe as unnecessary.

10 budget replacements for Aleix Vidal who Barcelona can sign
Vidal is out for the rest of the season and La Liga have allowed Barcelona to sign a replacement
@sunaadh by Sunaadh Sagar Top 5 / Top 10 15 Feb 2017, 19:01 IST
Aleix Vidal suffered a horrible injury against Deportivo Alaves
Aleix Vidal's horror injury against Deportivo Alaves has ruled them out for the rest of the season. However, according to Article 124.3 of the Spanish Football Federation (RFEF) guidelines, Barcelona can sign a free agent or a player from La Liga outside the transfer window, provided that Vidal is left out of the squad for the rest of the season.
Luis Enrique has already confirmed that Barcelona are in the transfer market, saying “Aleix is a player who we are going to miss considerably because we don't have the biggest of squads. It [A new signing] is an option we are considering and we will see if we can find someone that suits us.”
The replacement cannot play for Barcelona in the UEFA Champions League, although that could be moot following Barcelona's 4-0 thrashing by Paris Saint-Germain in the first leg.
Here are 10 replacements for Aleix Vidal that Barcelona can sign:
#1 Martin Caceres – Free Agent
Probably the best option for Barcelona at the moment – Martin Caceres already has played for Barcelona, signing for the Catalans in 2008. They moved on to Juventus, with the Old Lady releasing the Uruguayan from their contract last summer. Caceres has had recurring knee injuries though, and while they would represent an experienced stop gap signing, Barcelona ought to be cautious.
#2 Maicon – Free Agent
Another Serie A outcast, Maicon would probably not be the ideal signing for Barcelona. The fullback barely made the Roma squad last year amidst allegations of being overweight, and was released from their contract last summer. At the age of 35, Maicon does not have much football left in him, although they do have Champions League pedigree.
#3 Jose Bosingwa – Free Agent
The former Chelsea fullback looked distinctly mediocre at Queens Park Rangers and Trabzonspor, before being released by the Turkish club at the end of the 2015/16 season. The 34 year old is without a club at the moment, and could suit Barcelona's need for an attacking fullback down the right wing.
SEOUL - South Korea's ousted President Park Geun-Hye was Monday charged with bribery involving millions of dollars over the corruption scandal that sparked their downfall.
Park, whose impeachment was confirmed by Seoul's top court last month, also faces charges of abusing their powers and leaking state secrets, Seoul prosecutors probing the scandal said in a statement.
"We have formally charged Park... with multiple offences including abuse of power, coercion, bribery and leaking state secrets," they said after wrapping up the months-long investigation.
Park is accused of colluding with their confidante Choi Soon-sil, who is already on trial, in coercing local conglomerates into donating a total of 77.4 billion won ($68 million) to two non-profit foundations.
Choi allegedly used some of the donations for personal gain.
Park is also accused of offering policy favours to top business people who enriched Choi, including Samsung heir Lee Jae-Yong who was arrested earlier and is also on trial for bribery.
Prosecutors on Monday also charged Shin Dong-Bin, the chairperson of the giant Lotte Group, with bribing Choi and Park.
Park, 65, has been behind bars at at a detention centre in the outskirts of Seoul since their arrest last month. The scandal prompted millions to take to the street for weeks calling for the ousting of the conservative president. Parliament impeached Park last December amid growing public pressure.
The Dodgers are 7-6. That translates to an 87-win pace, but there is little reason to draw major conclusions from a few weeks of games. The team finishes up a four-game series with Arizona on Monday, with a chance to take three of four.
As always, there is plenty to discuss. You can send me questions on Twitter @McCulloughTimes. Let's do this.
Put your hands over your ears, then?
The chatter connecting the Dodgers with Ryan Braun has always felt a tad strange to me, as Braun does not exactly fit the profile of the sort of player President of Baseball Operations Andrew Friedman likes to pursue. Braun is 33, they can only play a corner outfield spot (and maybe only left field) and he's locked into an expensive contract.
As one rival evaluator told me last summer, “It's a lot of money for an inflexible, left-field-only player with injury history. These are the types of players they're trying to get away from.” Now, after flailing against left-handed pitchers throughout 2016 and often at the start of 2017, the team's calculus may change. But Braun is still an imperfect fit, especially if the need is as simple as finding an outfielder who can mash southpaws. Those players basically grow on trees.
The Dodgers were linked to Braun last summer, in a deal that reportedly would have involved Yasiel Puig and Brandon McCarthy, and there were more talks this winter. My current understanding is the Dodgers are not seriously involved in discussions about Braun. That could change, obviously, but it's April, and six-time All-Stars rarely get traded in April.
The Brewers may be feeling pressure to shed Braun from their roster, though. Their 10-5 rights, which would allow them a full no-trade clause, kick in on May 24. For plenty of reasons, it would make sense for Milwaukee to move them before then, when Braun would hold all the leverage. Braun may not handcuff the Brewers like Brandon Phillips did in Cincinnati, but they would control the situation.
Braun makes a lot of money. The Brewers owe Braun $20 million this season. They owe them $20 million in 2018. They owe them $19 million in 2019. They owe them $17 million in 2020. In order to buy out their mutual option for 2021, the Brewers must pay Braun $4 million. In all, the team owes them $80 million.
The Dodgers, of course, can afford this. They have the largest payroll in the sport for the fourth consecutive season. But under Friedman, the team has tried to trim money off the books. They also would like some financial flexibility for after 2018, when Clayton Kershaw can become a free agent.
If the Dodgers continue to flounder against left-handed pitchers, Braun will be out there. But so will Andrew McCutchen, and a slew of players less expensive than Braun.
Soon. Quite soon, I think.
Hi Ross!
I would not be shocked to see Julio Urias replace Rich Hill in the rotation after Hill's latest blister setback. The assignment may go to Alex Wood, but with an off-day on Thursday, the Dodgers can re-set their rotation and skip Hill's spot for a turn. The need for a fifth starter will not re-emerge until the end of April.
Which, conveniently, is when Manager Dave Roberts suggested Urias would join the big-league squad.
Hard to say. Adrian Gonzalez has been a very good player for more than a decade, and has earned the benefit of the doubt regarding their first 50 plate appearances. He's shown an ability to reshape their swing to remain productive despite whatever their physical condition may be. But there have been some troubling signs early.
Some scouts I talked to noted their inability to drive the baseball, which could be related to the elbow that bothered them for most of spring training. Gonzalez has two extra-base hits thus far. Both were doubles.  They are hitting .238, and has often tried to take the ball the other way, rather than pull. That is not exactly encouraging.
It's 50 plate appearances. Gonzalez found a way to be productive in 2016, despite various issues with their neck and back, so perhaps they can do the same in 2017. But if they are still hitting .238 in June, and if Cody Bellinger is still hitting .395 in triple-A (or some realistic equivalent), it's a discussion worth revisiting. Bellinger looked lost in the Cactus League in March, but there's a reason the organization refused to discuss them in various trade scenarios over the winter.
Bellinger is likely to debut in the majors this season. When and where may be more dependent on Gonzalez's health and production than on whatever Bellinger does in Oklahoma City.
That sounds about right. Ryu has not dominated, but he's been useful. Given the severity of their shoulder surgery, that is a victory for both them and the organization. The bigger question is whether Ryu can post every fifth day for an extended period of time. Their fastball velocity dipped during their second outing, which isn't encouraging. I'm curious — and I suspect the Dodgers are too — to see how they hold up in the coming weeks.

Water and Sanitation Agency (WASA) gets 30 to 40 samples of water from every sub-division in the provincial capital on daily basis and ensures chlorination and flushing of lines if any sort of pollution is observed.
According to WASA spokesperson on Monday, the agency had installed 575 tube-wells and almost 400 filtration plants have been installed on these tube-wells. They said that 125 filtration plants were being installed in the city, which would become operational by the end of March.
Two men have been detained after an alleged armed robbery at a store in Anjou.
At around 2:30 a.m. Monday, an employee was threatened with what appears to be a firearm, according to Manuel Couture, Montreal police spokesperson.
The store is located at the intersection of Metropolitain Boulevard East and des Ormeaux street.
The 20 and 21-year-old suspects allegedly asked for money and were fleeing the scene by the back of the store when police arrived.
Both suspects were arrested after a short foot pursuit.
Back at the beginning of September, Elon Musk tweeted that the company would unveil its long rumored all-electric semi truck on October 26th. They noted that it was “tentatively” scheduled, leaving the door open for a date change if need be. Turns out that was a good call.
In a tweet this afternoon, Elon says the Semi unveil date is now set for November 16th — a shift of about three weeks.
The reasoning for the rescheduling? Musk mentions two things they're focusing on right now instead: Model 3 bottlenecks and Puerto Rico battery production.
Tesla Semi unveil now Nov 16. Diverting resources to fix Model 3 bottlenecks & increase battery production for Puerto Rico & other affected areas. — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) October 6, 2017
Yesterday morning Musk offered Tesla's assistance in rebuilding Puerto Rico's electric system after the devastation of Hurricane Maria left just 10 percent of the island with power; by the afternoon, the governor of Puerto Rico was tweeting back to say they wanted to talk about it.
As for the Model 3 bottlenecks mentioned: Tesla aimed to ship around 1,500 Model 3s in the third quarter of 2017, but disclosed on Monday that they'd ended up shipping around 260. While the company pinned the shortfall on production bottlenecks, they noted that they already “understand” the underlying issues and are “confident of addressing the manufacturing bottleneck issues in the near-term” — so, presumably, tackling those issues will be a key part of these next few weeks.

Unless you are on the receiving end, a put-down can be deliciously funny.
Whether it's a back-handed compliment or full-blown tongue lashing, humour can be a potent weapon when firing off jibes.
Now, a classic quip by the late Caroline Aherne's Mrs Merton has been named the greatest put-down from a British TV comedy show.
Talking to Debbie McGee about their husband, before their death last year, they asked: “But what first, Debbie, attracted you to the millionaire Paul Daniels?”
UKTV Play's survey of 2,000 people put Del Boy and Blackadder second and third as cutting comedy characters.
And 80% said humour is more important than aggression for a perfect put-down.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States will announce plans to impose tariffs on steel and aluminum from the European Union as early as Thursday morning, two people briefed on the matter said, confirming a report in the Wall Street Journal.
The decision would land ahead of a Friday expiration deadline for exemptions to the planned metals tariffs amid stalled trade talks with the EU and would likely prompt retaliation from the bloc.
The two sources said an announcement was planned for Thursday morning in Washington but that the timing could still change.
The U.S. Commerce Department and U.S. Trade Representative's Office did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
President Donald Trump on March 23 imposed a 25 percent tariff on steel imports and a 10 percent tariff on aluminum, but granted temporary exemptions to the EU, Canada, Mexico, Brazil, Australia and Argentina.
Trump invoked a 1962 trade law to erect protections for U.S. steel and aluminum producers on national security grounds, amid a worldwide glut of both metals that is largely blamed on excess production in China.
The European Commission, which coordinates trade policy for the 28 EU members, has said the bloc should be permanently exempted from the tariffs since it was not the cause of overcapacity in steel and aluminum.
The Commission has said the EU will set duties on 2.8 billion euros ($3.4 billion) of U.S. exports, including peanut butter and denim jeans, if its metals exports to the United States worth 6.4 billion euros ($7.5 billion) are subject to tariffs.
The tariffs, which have increased friction with U.S. trading partners worldwide and prompted several challenges before the World Trade Organization, are aimed at allowing the U.S. steel and aluminum industries to increase their capacity utilization rates above 80 percent for the first time in years.
Economists say the standoff with the EU could tip toward a trade war, particularly after Trump last week launched another national security investigation into car and truck imports that could lead to new U.S. tariffs.
The Trump administration has given permanent metals tariff exemptions to several countries including Australia, Argentina and South Korea, but in each case set import quotas.
Friday's deadline for exemptions also affects Mexico and Canada, which are in contentious negotiations with the United States on the North American Free Trade Agreement that Trump has said they want to revamp, or abandon if the talks fail.

June is pride month in Saskatoon and while the celebration has grown over the years, many say that doesn't mean the entire city accepts the festival's message. Joel Senick reports.
When the North Korean regime of Kim Jong-un threatened to fire a nuclear weapon toward the U.S. territory of Guam, President Trump predicted that the added attention from the threat would increase tourism to the tiny island in the Pacific Ocean.
And some tourism officials agree. But they don't think the increase will be substantial.
After the threat from North Korea, Trump spoke to Guam Gov. Eddie Calvo last week and not only assured them that the island would be protected by the U.S. military, but also encouraged them to consider the benefits of the showdown.
“I have to tell you, you have become extremely famous all over the world,” Trump told Calvo, according to a transcript released of the call.
“They are talking about Guam; and they're talking about you.” And when it comes to tourism, the president added, “I can say this: You're going to go up, like, tenfold with the expenditure of no money.”
Guam, an island known for its white-sand beaches and coral reef snorkeling, broke a 20-year record for visitation in July, with nearly 133,000 visitors. Guam is also home to two U.S. military bases, occupied by about 7,000 troops.
The new tourism record surpasses the previous high visitation mark set in 1997 and represents a 8.1% increase from the same month in 2016. Tourism represents about 50% of the island's economy.
The two biggest sources of visitors to Guam in July were Japan and South Korea, according to the Guam Visitors Bureau. Japanese visitors made up 39% of all visitors while South Korean tourists made up 46% of visitors in July. U.S. visitors made up only 6% of all tourism to the island.
Guam is home to about 160,000 people and is about 2,000 miles from North Korea. Surveys find that visitors are drawn to the island by its beaches and tropical climate.
Travel and tourism experts say it is possible that the attention brought to Guam by North Korea's threat could result in more visitors — assuming the harsh rhetoric between North Korea and the U.S. is resolved peacefully.
“All of this publicity is going to be good for Guam,” said Carl Winston, the director of the L. Robert Payne School of Hospitality and Tourism Management at San Diego State University.
In fact, the travel site Hipmunk.com reported a 438% increase in searches of flights from the U.S. to Guam from Aug. 8 to 13, compared with the week earlier.
Bjorn Hanson, a professor at New York University's Tisch Center for Hospitality and Tourism, agreed, saying “Guam has gained substantial awareness and added curiosity and the attention could be very favorable.”
But experts say it is highly unlikely that the North Korean threat — even after it is resolved — will boost visitation tenfold, as predicted by Trump.
Winston dismissed the prediction as hyperbole, while Hanson added that Guam probably doesn't even have the hotels, restaurants or airline capacity to handle a tenfold increase in tourism.
Henry H. Harteveldt, a travel industry analyst with Atmosphere Research Group, was even more skeptical. They noted that flights from the U.S. to Guam are 17 hours long and are typically more expensive that flying to Hawaii.
“I'm not sure there will be a rush of tourists from America or elsewhere,” they said.

A court on Friday sentenced a radicalized French woman to 10 years in prison after traveling to Syria where their son was fighting alongside Islamic State militants.
Christine Riviere, 51, dubbed by investigators as “Jihadi Gran”, was arrested in 2014 after three trips to Syria, which they said were aimed at spending time with their son in case they were killed.
Announcing the decision, the judge said Riviere had demonstrated “a firm commitment” to Islamic State and had contributed to strengthening the group logistically.
France, like other European nations, is wrestling with how to deal with those returning from the Syrian conflict. A presidency official said last week that half of the 500 children were born there, and in total about 2,000 French nationals or residents had gone to the two countries,
“Instead of trying to disengage your son, it seems on the contrary that you encouraged him,” the judge said.
Investigators believe that Riviere's son, Tyler Vilus, climbed the Islamic State hierarchy to lead a Francophile group.
Arrested in July 2015 in Turkey and now imprisoned in France, Vilus is suspected of having known members of the network that planned and carried out the November 2015 attacks in Paris in which 130 people were killed.
The sentencing comes a week after a mother-of-three was found guilty of financing terrorism after they sent money abroad to their radicalized son who later traveled to fight in Syria. They were sentenced to two years in jail.
In a headline that will feel like a flashback to 2016 for St. Louis Blues fans, David Perron has once again signed a contract with the team that drafted him. Perron's infatuation with playing in St. Louis is well documented, but fans are split on the decision to return to this well. Given the way this summer has played out so far, though, Blues fans should be thankful for players like Perron, who love St. Louis and are eager to play there.
Draft Day for David
It was a pleasant day in Columbus, OH when Perron was drafted in 2007. Like most of the players in that room, Perron was only a teenager, waiting to hear what franchise they would call home for the foreseeable future. The Sherbrooke, Quebec native heard their name called 26th overall. The Franchise? The St. Louis Blues, a team Perron would become very fond of over the course of their career.
They quickly emerged as the centerpiece of the core of the rebuilding Blues. Along with fellow prospects like David Backes, T.J. Oshie, and Patrik Berglund, Perron blossomed and was part of the squad that returned the Blues to relevance, and to the playoffs. In their first stint with St. Louis, Perron recorded 198 points in 340 games.
A Crumbling Core
Over time, Blues fans became increasingly dissatisfied with the lack of production from this young group. Perron, in particular, was labeled a player who took silly penalties and disappeared in the playoffs. Despite having signed a four-year extension the summer before, the Blues traded Perron to the Edmonton Oilers in the summer of 2013, receiving in exchange Magnus Paajarvi and a 2014 second-round pick (which became Ivan Barbashev).
Perron took off in Edmonton, scoring 57 points in their first season. But the Oilers were still rebuilding at the time, and as sellers, Perron was traded once again to the Pittsburgh Penguins at the 2014-15 deadline. Despite some early success, Perron never really caught on with the Penguins and a season later, at the 2015-16 trade deadline, they were dealt to the Anaheim Ducks. In 28 games to finish the season there, they recorded 20 points, and after stints with four different teams in four years, they would finally get to choose their own destination as an unrestricted free agent.
Home Away from Home
Perrons had plenty of options as a free agent. Among them was an extremely compelling offer: a chance to return to their home province and play with their childhood team, the Montreal Canadiens.
But Perron did not take a hometown discount, at least, not to play with the Canadiens. Reports at the time suggested that they not only rejected an offer from their dream team but rejected an offer for more money than the one they took. For Perron, the most compelling opportunity was not the chance to return to their childhood team but to return to the team that raised him, the St. Louis Blues.
Finally coming home! Missed you guys dearly! Cannot wait to see all of you again! Back to my 1st love @StLouisBlues pic.twitter.com/gbjJsse3oP — David Perron (@DP_57) July 1, 2016
Calling St. Louis “home” and referring to the team as “my 1st love” made clear how Perron felt. No other offer appealed to them more and they signed a two-year deal with an AAV of $3.750 million.
“He was very excited about the opportunity to come back to St. Louis,” Blues GM Doug Armstrong said in an interview with NHL.com. “He certainly has a warm spot for the fans and the city. When you have players that have been here and are looking to come back, it was nice to hear the excitement in David's voice about returning to the team that drafted him.”
Perron's year with the Blues was a successful one. One of the few players on the team who did not miss a game in the 2016-17 season, Perron recorded 46 points in 82 games. When the playoffs rolled around, however, Perron was once again a non-factor, tallying only one point in eleven games.
What Happens in Vegas…
After the season, the Blues were faced with a difficult decision: who to protect in the Expansion Draft? With just a year left on their deal and without a No Movement Clause forcing protection, Perron was left unprotected and, unsurprisingly, they became a Vegas Golden Knight shortly thereafter.
Perron would go on to have a career year with the Golden Knights, who had a magical season as one of the most successful expansion teams in the history of sports. Perron recorded 66 points in 70 games with the Knights, including 50 assists. In 15 playoff games, they recorded 9 points. Both totals were career highs and Perron had positioned themselves to demand a big contract as a returning UFA.
…Doesn't Stay in Vegas
According to TSN's Darren Dreger, Perron had as many as five offers to consider in 2018, but perhaps the decision was a foregone conclusion. With a 4-year, $16 million contract on the table from the team that, according to an Instagram post they made when they left for Vegas, “made [him] a man in the 7 years I played,” Perron once again signed with the Blues.
The news was met with mixed reviews by fans. Some acknowledged that Perron was a talented top-nine forward coming off a career year and that $4 million is not a lot to pay them per season. Others were annoyed that the Blues had returned again to Perron for help. The initial skepticism was washed away in the aftermath of the Ryan O'Reilly trade but there is little question it will return when Perron makes their first mistake next season.
Perron's Love Affair with St. Louis
Perron deserves a chance to be loved by the fans of St. Louis as much as they love them. In a summer when the Blues were publicly snubbed by John Tavares, Perron's clear admiration and fondness for the city, its hockey team, and its fans should be appreciated. The fact that they took less money to return to the Blues, twice, should be celebrated.
With the inclusion of Patrik Berglund in the Ryan O'Reilly trade, Perron is now the only member of that young forward core that once had so much promise. And while that core never brought home a Stanley Cup, their return should excite Blues fans nonetheless. Yes, David Perron has signed with the St. Louis Blues again. Yes, it's a story we've heard before but it's one that never gets old.
New Brunswick announced on Monday the name of the retail stores that will sell cannabis to the public — CannabisNB.
The stores will function as a subsidiary of NB Liquor.
“CannabisNB will help us achieve the goals of the legislative framework your government has introduced,” said Finance Minister Cathy Rogers in a press release.
According to the province, a trademark application has been filed for the CannabisNB name.

Ahead of the planned legalization of cannabis next year, the province placed a tender for 20 retail location in 15 communities across New Brunswick.
Under the province's Cannabis Control Act, the minimum age for buying cannabis will be set at 19, with a requirement that users lock up their marijuana when at home.
Advice from other jurisdictions like Colorado and Washington were reportedly used in shaping the province's framework.
New Brunswick Liquor president Brian Harriman said in October that identification will be checked at the door of all retail locations and all products will be securely under glass.

Nova Scotia and P.E.I. both set their legal age for marijuana at 19 last week, but are taking different paths on how weed will be sold.
P.E.I. will sell marijuana at stand-alone outlets run separately by its liquor commission, while Nova Scotia said pot will be sold alongside alcohol in its provincial liquor stores.

Two weeks ago, a donation jar was stolen from Rideau Acres campground in Kingston. The funds being raised were intended to help a family in Western Kenya send two of their boys to secondary school.
Since the story aired on television last week, the response has been overwhelming, says fundraiser organizer Cameron Dick.

“This setback has really transformed into a generous outpouring from the Kingston community,” Dick said.
“The day after the news story aired, we had half a dozen individuals call in and pledge money, which helped us get even above what was in the jar initially.”
Dick estimates the jar contained about $300 when it was stolen. An Ottawa woman has since been charged in the incident.
Others have also pitched in to help. Charlie Young, a former Canadian peacekeeping officer and the owner of Mary Brown's restaurant on Princess Street, says they and their wife are planning a month-long fundraiser to boost the initial effort.

“Starting on August 21st, that's our kickoff day,” they said. “We will be selling little cutout books and little cutout buses — a dollar for [each] — proceeds go directly to Cameron's fund.”
Young says Dick will be speaking at the restaurant on September 15 to share the story of the Kenyan family and how those in Kingston can help.
GENEVA (Reuters) - Conflict between Myanmar's army and guerrillas of the Kachin Independence Army (KIA) in northern Myanmar has escalated since Jan. 19, including in Sumprabum, Waingmaw and Tanai townships, a U.N. humanitarian report said on Friday.
“The United Nations and its humanitarian partners are concerned about the safety of civilians in these areas,” it said.
“The Tanai area has seen heavy fighting since 25 January 2018. There have been reports of a number of civilians killed or injured.”
The KIA is one of Myanmar's most powerful militias and has clashed regularly with the Myanmar military since 2011, when a 17-year-old ceasefire broke down.
It is part of the predominantly ethnic Chinese Myanmar National Democratic Alliance Army (MNDAA) which clashed with Myanmar's military in 2015, in fighting that spilled over the Chinese border and displaced tens of thousands.
The U.N. report said aid agencies were reporting about 1,800 people, mainly labourers, had been evacuated from the Tanai area as a result of the latest fighting, but other civilians were still in the areas of conflict and unable to leave.
U.N. staff had not been granted access to the area and could not independently verify the information, it said.
In Sumprabum township more than 700 people were sheltering in the forest after being displaced on Jan. 22. They included villagers and about 500 people from an internal displacement camp who fled after mortar bombs landed near the camp.
Tanai and Sumprabum are located on the two major roads running north from Myitkyina, the capital of Kachin state, the northernmost part of Myanmar, between China and India.
On three occasions since mid-Decmber, most recently on Jan. 27, mortar bombs also landed close to a displacement camp in Waingmaw township, just cross the Irrawaddy river from Myitkyina, the report said.
Myanmar is already under international scrutiny for its handling of the Rohingya crisis on the Bangladesh border.
The U.N. human rights investigator for Myanmar, Yanghee Lee, was barred in December from visiting the Rohingya areas and also Kachin and Shan states.
They told Reuters at the time that the civilian government had no authority in Kachin state, since anything connected to security issues was controlled by military commanders.
They called on the international community to put more pressure on military commanders, and on China, to ensure that human rights were respected in the conflict.
Ghoulishness envelops Arkansas' decision to pump deadly drugs into eight men over the next fortnight. Although two of the eight scheduled executions have definitively been stayed — and judges have issued orders halting the remaining six — the state has been vigorously appealing these roadblocks.
Articles about “midazolam,” the drug whose expiration date prompted Arkansas Governor Asa Hutchinson to schedule this unprecedented mass execution are abuzz on the internet and social media. By this point, many Americans have heard or are generally aware that while midazolam is supposed to render the condemned unconscious and insensate, it has been linked to a number of gruesome and botched executions in the United States.
These are lethal injections where instead of drifting into a sterile, serene, slumber-like death, the condemned have for minutes and even hours, convulsed, coughed, clenched their fists, writhed and thrashed their bodies, murmured, spoken, or cried out in obvious distress; some have gasped for interminably long periods of time mimicking the discomfiting death-throes of still-live fish thrown flat on a sunbaked pier, to suffocate and to burn.
Importantly, torturous executions linked to midazolam have occurred when just one or at most two executions have been scheduled at one time. This is why a chorus of lawyers, law professors, medical experts, ethicists, and former correctional officials, have all raised their voices in the last few days against Hutchinson's mass-killing decree.
“Multiple executions create rushed circumstances. Rushed circumstances risk error,” said Robert Dunham, executive director of the Death Penalty Information Center. In other words, the assembly-line nature of Hutchinson's expediency-centric execution schedule exacerbates the risk that one or more of the men to be executed next week will suffer an excruciatingly painful execution; an execution plainly violative of the Constitution's prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment.
In January 2016, I wrote about the then-impending execution of Christopher Brooks in Alabama — an execution likely botched by the controversial use of midazolam — a drug that according to competent medical experts, is inappropriate for use in executions.
Specifically, I wrote: “In the United States, we rightly condemn barbaric executions in other countries, like in North Korea, where, in front of an audience, Kim Jon-Un executed their defense minister with an anti-aircraft gun, or, in Saudi Arabia, where beheading remains a common practice. We have especially condemned ISIS executions, executions that have included burning and burying people alive.”
Highlighting Brooks' federal defenders' arguments that, because of the documented problems with midazolam, Brooks would feel like “he is [both] being buried alive” and “burn[ed] alive from the inside”, I plaintively demanded: “How can we countenance the fact that we, as Americans, may also be subjecting human beings — irrespective of their crimes, even heinous ones — to that same end? Can the fact that US executions are not broadcast to the masses from some windswept desert in the Middle East, and occur, instead, in sterile prisons, under the color of law, really make such a difference? Isn't it morally wrong to execute someone by reproducing the sensation of being buried alive followed by burning them from the inside out?” I lamented, “Aren't we, as a nation, and as people, better than that?”
If Arkansas' state-sanctioned killing spree goes forward this week, the answer to that question will resoundingly be “no.” It'll be no, no, no, no, no, no.
And as far as the title of my one-year-old Huffington Post blog, “When Will The United States Stop ‘Tinkering With The Machinery of Death?'”, based on the monumentally-high level of depravity promising to be on display next week in Arkansas, not soon enough.

The current Triton has been released back in 2014 and went on sale in early 2015. The truck builds on the success of the previous model having a very similar design underneath the new body. It also gets new engines and a slightly better suspension system. However, it is not perfect and it still lacks some features when compared to its rivals. For starters, the ride quality in the current Triton is as bad as it gets for a truck in this class. Because it still uses leaf springs in the back and a rather basic solid-axle setup, it is quite bouncy when driven without weight in the bed. On top of that, even when it is loaded the Triton isn't that much better and it pales in comparison with the Navara or the Amarok.

Later this week, New York-via-Florida indie-poppers the Drums are coming back with their new album “Abysmal Thoughts”. They've already shared a generous handful of tracks from the album: “Blood Under My Belt,” “Heart Basel,” “Head Of The Horse.” And now they've shared another one, which unites them with a name we haven't heard in a while. “Mirror” is a shimmery sigh of a song, and it features vocals from Ioanna Gika, frontman for Los Angeles electronic rockers IO Echo. Below, listen to the song and check out a statement about it from Drums frontman Jonny Pierce.
Pierce writes:
“Abysmal Thoughts” is the first album where I am taking responsibility for myself. It's the first album where I look more inward and less outward. It is an album of self exploration. Maybe the problems in my adult life come from a broken place inside of me. Maybe I can't properly love because I don't really know who I am. Maybe people leave me because they have no other choice. This entire album felt like intense therapy and “Mirror” was the first session. My steady anchor through the entire recording process was my dearest friend, Ioanna Gika — they held my hand through all of it and so I thought it fitting to ask them to sing with me on this song.
“Abysmal Thoughts” is out 6/16 on Anti-.

Pruitt Proposes New Rule Defining What Science Can Be Used By EPA
Enlarge this image toggle caption Jason Andrew/Getty Images Jason Andrew/Getty Images
The head of the Environmental Protection Agency, Scott Pruitt, has proposed a new rule that restricts scientific research that can be used by the agency for its regulatory decisions.
The proposed rule only allows the use of studies that make all data publicly available for anyone to analyze. Pruitt proposed the new rule as a way to make the agency's decision-making more "transparent, objective and measurable."
"The American people ought to be able to have confidence, assurance, that the findings, the record that we build ... can be assessed, it can be evaluated, it can be analyzed," Pruitt said.
The Heartland Institute, a conservative think-tank, has commended Pruitt on the rule. "For decades, the EPA has improperly claimed massive power to regulate nearly every aspect of our economy and lives. It is long overdue that the EPA should make such data and collection methods available for public review and analysis," Tim Heulskamp, the think tank's president said in a statement.
But several scientific organizations have expressed concerns. "Our concern with this is they are quite literally limiting the best available science that can be used by the EPA," says Sean Gallagher, the senior government relations officer for the American Association for the Advancement of Science.
The EPA's regulatory decisions are often based on epidemiological studies looking at the potential health effects of pollutants, like pesticides and particulate matter. "Those studies involve people like you and me, signing confidentiality agreements that the scientists doing the studies won't reveal my personal health information, like my vital statistics, or my death certificate, if I die during the course of the study," says Gallagher. "This is the kind of science that the EPA relies on, whether it looks at chemicals or particulates and their mortality or health effects. It involves private data."
And this private data can't be made public, they say. And so, it limits the studies available to the agency for any decision-making, they add.
"It would not help make the science any more transparent," says Andrew Rosenberg, of the Union of Concerned Scientists, an advocacy group representing scientists.
When they proposed the new rule, Pruitt talked about a "replication crisis," referring to scientific studies that can't be reproduced. But that crisis applies more to the field of clinical trials, says Rosenberg, where new drugs are being tested for their efficacy.
"That's very different from what the EPA does," they add. The agency often relies on studies that involve long-term surveys of exposure to certain environmental pollutants and associated health effects. "What are you supposed to do? Go back in time in five years and redo the survey? That's really a false flag."
The new rule would only restrict the science used by the agency and limit the agency's ability to protect public health, they say. It could affect the agency's ability to protect the public from everything from air and water pollutants to household products.
"The scientific process is [already] incredibly transparent," says Gallagher. "It's evidence-based, it follows the facts where they go. It tries to root out bias."
"The agency should be able to use all good, peer reviewed, scrutinized studies," they add. "It shouldn't be limiting the science."

Caldwell says they support him, having worked closely with them during their first term.
“He's very process driven, but they do do things and they do it in a way that reflects the values in this community. I think we need folks like that,” Caldwell said. “I think he's solid. When you think about the tough things they have addressed, there are some very controversial things.”

GENEVA - After a 12-hour ordeal, rescue workers pulled a two-year-old girl unharmed out of a deep crevice they tumbled into during a family hike in the Swiss Alps, police said Friday.
“She emerged basically unscathed, with just a few scratches,” Christian Zuber, a spokesperson for the regional police in the canton of Valais, told AFP.
The girl and their family, reportedly from the German-speaking part of Switzerland, had been visiting the region near the Aletsch glacier in southern Switzerland when they strayed from a foot path and fell into a narrow fissure in the ground. More than 100 rescue workers toiled into the early hours of Thursday to hoist the girl out of six-metre-deep (20-foot) cavity, they said, adding that they were finally pulled up around 0000 GMT.
Matthias Lorenz, who heads the fire brigade in the Aletsch region, told the ATS news agency that the rescue workers had been in a race against the clock as they carefully moved away earth, rocks and boulders, “centimetre by centimetre”.
The child had given signs of life throughout the rescue operation, they said. “I have never before seen such a rescue operation,” they added. The girl was later taken by helicopter to a hospital in Bern, where they spent one night under observation before being released, Zuber said.
A complicated effort to recover the bodies of two missing Thai exchange students who are thought to be trapped in a car that plummeted hundreds of feet into the raging Kings River has just become even more fraught.
The Fresno County Sheriff's Office announced this weekend that searchers have found evidence of yet another couple who disappeared recently from Sequoia National Park and may have also driven off the same section of Highway 180.
While watching a TV news clip on the missing Thai couple, a Fresno County search-and-rescue team member spotted a California license plate and car parts in some brush. Days later, the plate was linked to a missing husband and wife from San Diego.
The discovery has triggered a second, parallel investigation in the same area where University of South Florida exchange students Bhakapon Chairatanathongporn, 28, and Thiwadee Saengsuriyarit, 24, are believed to have perished in their red sedan. The wrecked vehicle was spotted July 26 in rapids at the bottom of a treacherous gorge some 500 feet below Highway 180.
Authorities say the stretch of river is extremely dangerous and inaccessible to helicopter crews. They have yet to determine on a plan to reach the vehicle.
It was on Aug. 8, while watching a video clip about efforts to organize a recovery plan, that the search-and-rescue team member spotted the license plate and made a note of its number — 6XMM431.
The team member checked records on the license plate, but that didn't turn up any reports of a missing or stolen vehicle or a crash, sheriff's officials said. But team members submitted the license plate along with some other car parts found in the area — about 40 yards upstream from the Thai couple's vehicle — to the California Highway Patrol so it could create a report.
Three days later, the family of 31-year-old Yinan Wang and their 30-year-old wife Jie Song reported the pair missing. A relative explained that Wang and Song were last seen in the Crystal Caves in Sequoia National Park on Aug. 6, that they were expected to drive north and stay the night in Fresno and then continue on to Yosemite National Park.
The pair was due back in San Diego on Aug. 9, the relative told authorities.
But when Fresno County deputies followed up on the missing person's report Aug. 11 and called Sequoia National Park, they learned that the pair had been reported missing there, too, officials said. Wang and Song were last seen driving their white Ford Focus, license plate 6XMM431.
A flyover of the area where the license plate and other car parts were found turned up no signs of Wang or Song, officials said. No bodies have been found in the Kings River, but park officials down-river will continue to check.
In the meantime, authorities are assessing plans to recover the bodies of the Thai students.
The vehicle's airbags deployed when their car crashed into the river, making it virtually impossible to see inside the vehicle from a distance.
The crumpled vehicle was first spotted in the river not far from Convict Flat Campground in Hume.
In a Facebook post last week, the Thai Consulate explained its recent discussions with sheriff's officials, noting that the agencies involved were making the recovery efforts a top priority and would not allow any private agency or person to recover the bodies because such efforts could be fatal and illegal.
“The recovery must be very careful,” the Facebook post read. “The torrents and rapids are about 30 feet away from the point where the car is stuck and there are three more rapids in the same manner.”
Fresno County sheriff's spokesperson Tony Botti said authorities cannot use a helicopter to recover the car.
“You might rip it in half and get part of it,” they said of the car. “There's also a wind factor. The canyon zigzags and creates strange wind patterns, so if you send a helicopter, it can joggle the aircraft and make it dangerous for personnel.”

Heavy rain and thunderstorms could hit parts of the country as the UK heatwave is interrupted.
Forecasters say there is a risk of showers of a thundery nature and downpours tomorrow.
But it's not all bad news - as the rain is not expected to last for a long time.
The heatwave is set to continue and by the weekend temperatures are likely to get to as high as 31C.
A Met Office spokesperson told Mirror Online: "There will be lots of sunshine across the UK but through the day tomorrow there is a risk of heavy showers and some will be of a thundery nature.
"There is a risk of thunderstorms tomorrow particularly in the south and south east of England.
"Some places might see a downpour.

The glorious heat in Britain is forecast to remain even through the second half of July and August.
Met Office forecaster Helen Roberts previously said: “There's no sign of an end to the heat.
"Warmth looks like continuing for the first half of July.
"And forecast models point to above-average temperatures for much of July and August.”
High pressure over the UK is causing the high levels of sunshine and clear skies.

Unlike our usual hot spells that are down to warm air pushing in from the continent, this heatwave is caused by the weather lifting the temperature day on day.
Last month was one of the hottest for almost 400 years.
June bordered on the top 10 hottest since records began 359 years ago in 1659, Met Office figures show.
The average temperature during the month was 16.4C, 2.2C above normal, from June 1-29 in central England, the region enclosed by the Thames, Lancashire and Bristol.
June's UK rainfall was down by 52 per cent, worsening drought fears.
The UK record temperature for the month is 36.7C registered at Heathrow on July 1, 2015.
Alberta's finance minister is happy Ottawa improved its original proposal for how much tax revenue from marijuana provinces will get.
On Monday, the federal government agreed to give the provinces and territories a 75 per cent share of the tax revenues from the sale of legalized marijuana.
READ MORE: Ottawa agrees to give provinces 75% of marijuana tax revenue
“We're going to have costs that need addressing, and we're not sure what those are,” Joe Ceci said.
“And so, today's arrangement is much better than the one they proposed earlier and I think the premier and myself expressing our desire to get a better share is what helped realize this today.”
Last month, the Alberta NDP blasted Ottawa for its proposed tax on pot. Ceci said the 50-50 tax sharing proposal clearly wouldn't work.
READ MORE: Pot tax: Alberta asks Ottawa, ‘What are you smoking?'
“The federal government must be smoking something to think it will work for the provinces and Alberta. It's not (going to work). It's unacceptable,” Ceci said on Nov. 10. The federal Liberals had just proposed a $1 per gram tax on pot when it becomes legal in 2018 and suggested it split the tax 50-50 with the provinces. Ceci wasn't impressed and vowed to send a letter immediately “on behalf of all the provinces saying that's unacceptable and we need to get into a room together to work it out.” Watch below: Alberta Finance Minister Joe Ceci responds to the proposed 50/50 tax revenue split on marijuana between provincial and federal governments. On Monday, they reiterated the provinces would need resources to handle the bulk of work and costs associated with legalizing marijuana – from policing to education. “Provinces will bear the responsibility of the regulations, the risks, the infrastructure to proceed with this federal initiative,” Ceci said. “Make no mistake, we will do the hard work to protect children and youth and our communities. What we won't do is foot the bill for the federal government's campaign promise.” Federal Finance Minister Bill Morneau announced the new agreement Monday after a day-long meeting with their provincial and territorial counterparts. READ MORE: Alberta looking for feedback on weed via online survey
“What the feds have said is they can anticipate about $400 million in federal excise tax coming to them in the first year,” Ceci explained. “That would mean $100 million would go to the feds and the remaining part — $300 million — would get split among provinces on a proper basis.”
“The deal we came to today is better than the one they originally proposed,” Ceci said. “Our government fighting for that better deal helped shift them.”

This week, more than 200 newspapers across the State of Minnesota will publish no news on their front pages. This “Whiteout” is taking place during Minnesota Newspaper Week, August 13-19, a part of the Minnesota Newspaper Association's yearlong celebration of its 150th Anniversary. The Whiteout reminds Minnesotans of the important role that newspapers play, writing the first draft of history and telling the stories of their communities.
“In many communities across the State of Minnesota, the newspaper is the main source of local news,” said MNA Executive Director Lisa Hills. “Newspaper journalists across the state attend city council and school board meetings, they cover town festivals and local sports teams, and they arrive on the scene to document history during natural disasters and other community challenges. We know newspapers play an important role.”
Today, 25 daily and 295 non-daily newspapers, from Worthington to Warroad, Bird Island to Baudette, Elbow Lake to Ely and every community in between, belong to the Minnesota Newspaper Association.
“Minnesota Newspaper Week is a statewide initiative that reminds individuals of the importance of a free press,” reads Governor Mark Dayton's proclamation. “Freedom of the Press promotes a well-informed constituency, improves public policy, increases responsiveness and accountability, and enhances public confidence in governmental institutions.”
Minnesotans agree that newspapers play a vital role in the state. MNA's member newspapers have a total circulation of more than 2.2 million each week. A 2014 Scarborough readership survey found that 89 percent of Minnesotans accessed a newspaper in print and/or digital format in the past month. Minnesotans of all ages read Minnesota newspapers in print and online. It's no wonder that in a state where many read their local newspaper, the population is also civic-minded and involved in activities like voting in local elections. According to state officials, more than 81 percent of registered Minnesota voters cast ballots in the November 2016 election. That's just under 75 percent of eligible Minnesotans.
“We are proud to support Minnesota's vibrant newspaper industry and look forward to being here for the next 150 years,” said Hills.

NEW YORK — A 19-year-old Canadian has pleaded guilty to terrorism related charges in the U.S.
The U.S. Justice Department says Abdulrahman El Bahnasawy was one of three people arrested in New York City in connection with an alleged Islamic State-inspired plot more than a year ago.
The plot was revealed Friday after the case was unsealed.
A justice department news release issued Friday says El Bahnasawy, who has been in custody since the FBI arrested them in May 2016, pleaded guilty to terrorism offences and is awaiting sentencing.
Going up against the latest wave of state-supported competitors requires a new playbook for Western companies.
advertisement
On March 12, 2018, the U.S. government blocked Broadcom Inc.'s proposed merger with Qualcomm Inc. on the grounds of national security. The presumption was that the merger of the two chipmakers would have resulted in a third company, China's Huawei Technologies Co. Ltd., gaining a dominant position in the market for 5G mobile network technologies. Huawei is a “national champion” — a company that is heavily subsidized (either implicitly or explicitly) or, in some cases, owned by a government — and the U.S. government is concerned that its growth could provide the Chinese government with undue access to and control over U.S. communication networks.
While the threat posed by national champions is nothing new, their essential character has substantially changed, and the competitive advantage of national champions in the global marketplace has become more pronounced. Today's national champions are much more sophisticated, competing in more industries, and harder to spot than ever before. As a result, Western companies need a new strategic guide for competing against them.
A New Breed of Competitor
Traditionally, national champions have been large industrial companies, subject to a high degree of direct governmental oversight and intervention. Typically, they are unresponsive to global competitive forces, depending instead on explicit government subsidizes and protection. For instance, Indonesia's state-owned electricity provider, Perusahaan Listrik Negara, enjoys a government-created monopoly, but its inability to satisfy growing domestic demand has resulted in a costly and unreliable energy supply in the world's fourth most populous country.1
Today, however, there is a new breed of national champions. They differ from traditional champions in two principal ways: the form and degree of their government connections, and their basis of competition.
Modern national champions can be hard to identify. Their connections to government take a variety of forms, both corporate and noncorporate (via sovereign and other investment funds). The degree of government ownership and intervention in these national champions also varies widely. Sometimes governments hold explicit majority or minority ownership stakes in these companies, but increasingly, government involvement is more implicit.

This involvement includes restrictions on foreign competition, preferred access to government financing, funding through sovereign investment funds, preferential government contracts, and privileged access to natural resources.

New Delhi: Mukesh Ambani, India's richest man, and BP chief executive officer Bob Dudley on Thursday came calling on the government as they looked to revive investments in deep-sea gas exploration and production after an eight-year hiatus.
Dudley, whose last visit in January 2015 led to India revisiting the natural gas pricing formula and a higher rate for gas produced from deep-sea and difficult areas, met oil minister Dharmendra Pradhan Thursday afternoon. They were accompanied by BP India head Sashi Mukundan during the meeting. Forty five minutes into the meeting, Ambani joined them.
Both refused comment after the 80-minute meeting. Ambani and Dudley would meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi before making a media announcement about reviving investments in exploration and production. While the cap price for natural gas RIL-BP produce from the existing flagging fields in the KG-D6 block is capped at $2.48 per million British thermal unit, the rate gas from newer fields in the deep sea block would fetch $5.56 per mmBtu — a price considered attractive enough for reviving the investment cycle.
The duo have Satellited, R-Series and D-55 discoveries in the KG-D6 block which they plan to start producing from 2021 or 2022. RIL-BP currently produce gas from Dhirubhai-1 and 3 fields and oil and gas from MA field, three of the over one-and-half dozen discoveries made in KG-D6 block. The fields, which began gas production in April 2009, hit a peak output of 69.43 million standard cubic metres per day in March 2010 before water and sand ingress shut down well after well.
The block currently produces around 8.7mmscmd. Sources said work for developing R-Series and satellite discoveries has begun and a fresh investment plan would be formulated by the end of the year for development of R-Cluster fields in KG-D6 block. A field development plan (FDP) approved in August 2013 envisaged $3.18 billion investment in R-Series or D-34 gas field to produce 13-15mmscmd of gas for 13 years.
RIL-BP recently submitted FDP for two other discoveries D-29 and 30, which formed part of R-Cluster. Besides, another FDP of $1.529 billion for four satellite gas discoveries — D-2, 6, 19 and 22, was approved in 2012. The four fields can produce 10.36mmscmd. Both of these productions were to originally start by 2017 but unfavourable business environment and low gas prices led to the two partners pushing back the investments.
A new FDP would be presented to the regulator, DGH for the fields, sources said adding the two partners have also submitted a FDP of D-55 or MJ find. They said it will take 36-42 months to build and install new facilities on these fields and to drill new wells and hook them up. Also, they have over half a dozen discoveries in block NEC-25, off the Odisha coast.
D32 discovery in the block was recently declared commercial. However, development of the gas fields would be contingent on resolution of arbitration cases. RIL is locked in four arbitration cases with the government. It is in arbitration against the government disallowing recovery of certain KG-D6 gas field costs as a punishment for gas output lagging targets. Another arbitration is over deferring of a natural gas price hike due to the company from 1 April 2014.
The latest arbitration is against government demanding $1.55 billion compensation from RIL and its partners for “unfairly” producing ONGC's gas.

League Two: Luton Town 1 Exeter City 0
Luton Town bounced back in fine style from Tuesday night's 3-2 defeat against Wycombe by picking up an absolutely crucial victory against fellow promotion chasers Exeter City this afternoon.
Although it might not have had the amount of goals that home fans have had the luxury of witnessing at times this season, make no mistake, this was one of Hatters' best displays, especially first half, in recent matches, as they were by far the better team throughout.
In fact the only criticism that could be levelled at the hosts was that they weren't out of sight in the closing stages, as despite dominating possession and territory, a lack of composure in the final third meant an unusually poor City were still in the contest.
However, they barely tested home keeper Marek Stech, who kept one of their most comfortable clean sheets from the 15 racked up now this term, as they fell 12 points behind, albeit it still with two games in hand.
Hatters boss Nathan Jones handed debuts to two deadline day signings in Flynn Downes and Jake Jervis, while Harry Cornick came back in, with injured duo Johnny Mullins and Elliot Lee out, Andrew Shinnie dropping to the bench, where leading scorer Danny Hylton gave Luton a real boost by being fit enough to join him.
A bright start saw Downes take the ball off Rea, who dropped into central defence, look up and find Cornick. They spun their man cleverly and unleashed a fierce left-footer from 18 yards that crashed against the post.
Jervis was quick to show their pace, setting off on a counter attack and trying their luck from 20 yards, not getting the required bend to find the net.
Town stayed in the ascendancy, something they hadn't done in midweek, Potts' first time cross headed out to Jervis who scuffed wide, as they then hooked an awkward volley over, Cornick also not picking their head up with the unmarked Berry screaming for the pass.
Hiram Boateng made Stech at least get their top dirty from range, while Rea produced a superb block from Kyle Edwards as Luton were caught short on the right hand side.
Town were inches away on 28 minutes, Collins picked out by Cornick and their deflected cross-shot beat Pym only to clip the top of the bar.
There was no let up in Hatters' sustained attacks though, the hosts having shouts for a penalty turned down when Daniel Seaborne fell on the ball in the box, Jack Stacey sending the rebound into orbit.
However, Luton were ahead and deservedly so on 38 minutes as Berry fed Potts who nipped between a gap in the visitors defence, teeing up Cornick on the edge of the box, their shot taking a wicked deflection off Jordan Storey to wrong foot Pym.
Lee looked for an instant second, drilling an effort that Pym parried away to safety.
Although comfortably on top, Hatters needed to be wary after the interval, as they had been second best in their opening 45 minutes at St James' Park back in August, only to then blitz their opponents with three goals in 10 minutes.
To be fair, that never looked remotely likely repeating itself for the Grecians, Jervis demonstrating once more they were not afraid to chance their arm, wide once more.
Town still kept a tight leash on their opponents, Downes winning more than one fine challenge and showing a lovely array of passing, keeping things simple to regularly find their man and keep their team on the front foot.
Berry looked to extend Town's lead, narrowly missing the near post from 20 yards while they were then left all alone to meet Alan Sheehan's corner, heading into the ground and straight at Pym.
Still Exeter had nothing going forward as Sheehan made sure that former Town striker Jayden Stockley, who had caused Luton such problems earlier in the campaign, was to have a fruitless afternoon, never allowing them a second on the ball.
Hylton came on for Jervis with 12 minutes to go, combining with Collins for the latter to send a curler just wide and then heading over the top from a set-piece himself.
Lloyd Jones came on for their debut in the closing stages with Cornick cramping up, as Luton switched to three centre halves for the final five minutes.
City had the ball in the net though Liam McAlinden, as they looked to have rescued an unlikely point, but it was rightly ruled out for a clear foul on Stech.
The Town stopper was called upon for one final save, showing good handling to stop Kane Wilson's bouncing drive, while when Boateng shot wastefully over, that was that.
Wins for Wycombe and Notts County meant the top three stayed the same, but Luton did move 10 points clear of fourth, that berth now taken by Mansfield Town.

A new “buy local” campaign has started in the Pierrefonds-Roxboro borough to help businesses make a comeback.
Many parking lots sit empty in the borough, including one on the corner of St-Jean and Pierrefonds boulevards.
Merchant owners are still struggling following the devastating spring floods.

The owners hope the “buy local” initiative will help.

It's unclear how long the campaign will last, but attracting new anchor stores to open is considered one of the fastest ways to revitalize strip malls.
The Seattle Seahawks “Legion of Boom” defensive backfield has been making it tough on NFL quarterbacks and receivers for more than half a decade.
Cornerback Richard Sherman and safeties Kam Chancellor and Earl Thomas are mainstays, and cornerback Jeremy Lane the latest to fill the role opposite Sherman.
The quartet — along with an aggressive front seven led by end Michael Bennett and linebacker Bobby Wagner — is expected to give Rams' quarterback Jared Goff and coach/play-caller Sean McVay their toughest challenge yet on Sunday at the Coliseum.
“It's going to be a great measuring stick for our offense,” offensive coordinator Matt LaFleur said Friday.
Goff struggled against the Seahawks last season in a 24-3 defeat at CenturyLink Field, a game that was played three days after the Rams fired Jeff Fisher as coach. During the loss, Sherman leveled Goff on a scramble along the sideline.
But Goff has progressed under the tutelage of McVay, LaFleur and quarterbacks coach Greg Olson. New left tackle Andrew Whitworth has protected Goff, and running back Todd Gurley and receivers Sammy Watkins, Robert Woods, Cooper Kupp and others have provided dependable targets for the second-year quarterback.
Goff has passed for seven touchdowns, with only one interception.
The Seahawks secondary is capable of ruining that efficiency.
Thomas is a five-time Pro Bowl selection. Sherman and Chancellor made the Pro Bowl four times.
The continuity is apparent in a veteran unit that ranks fourth in the NFL in passing defense.
“A lot of it starts with Earl Thomas,” LaFleur said. “He's a guy that, on the back end, he's all over the place and they play with their hair on fire.
“They're so good at diagnosing plays and then just teeing off on whatever they see.”
Happy return
Pharoh Cooper is eager to build on last week's 66-yard kickoff return against the Dallas Cowboys.
“Looking forward to breaking some more,” the second-year receiver said.
Cooper's play came a week after they fumbled late in the game against the San Francisco 49ers.
McVay was pleased with the way Cooper responded to the miscue. They also said they were confident that Cooper would come through at receiver if more opportunities on offense present themselves.
Cooper backs up Woods, and has one catch for four yards.
Cooper would welcome more opportunities on offense.
“I love kick-returning — it's my role for right now on this team and I'm going to do whatever it takes,” Cooper said. “But I'm never going to lose sight of the fact that I'm still ready to burst onto the scene as a receiver in this league.”
Etc.
Jamon Brown (groin) was limited and is questionable for Sunday's game. Safety Lamarcus Joyner (hamstring) is doubtful. Seahawks defensive ends Cliff Avril (neck) and Quinton Jefferson (hand) have been ruled out for Sunday's game.

White nationalist demonstrators walk into Lee park surrounded by counter demonstrators in Charlottesville, Va. (AP)
Donald Trump's conservative politics has encouraged a movement of white nationalists whose extremist beliefs reject American multiculturalism.
The violent protests that left a woman dead in Charlottesville, Virginia shocked many Americans with TV footage of an estimated 1,000 neo-Nazis and white supremacists, guarded by "militiamen" brandishing semi-automatic rifles and wearing body armour.
Encouraged by President Donald Trump and buoyed by social media, a new generation of extremist start-ups has taken root, mostly created by angry young white men anxious to exploit fears of Latino immigration and radical Islam, the shrinking white share of the US population and the cultural shifts of globalisation.
Analysts say theses groups may have members in the tens of thousands and tacit supporters in the hundreds of thousands.
They have supplanted the old hotbeds of racist, anti-government and fascist activism, including the notorious Ku Klux Klan, which has dwindled to a few thousand members.
Until now, even with the alliance of powerful Trump advisor Steve Bannon, the so-called "alt-right" movement and its violent fringes have been deeply fragmented, unable to coalesce around common ideologies, goals and tactics.
However, this could change.
"They are acting in concert right now," said Spencer Sunshine of Political Research Associates, which specialises in research on right-wing groups.
"The rising tide of Trump-ist racism is raising their boats."
Sunshine pointed to the Charlottesville "Unite the Right" protests.
Against multiculturalism
The alt-right rues the loss of an idealized American identity, espousing white nationalism and "traditional" euro-centric culture as the foundation of US culture.
It rejects "multiculturalism" that gives more prominence to non-white groups and elevates the equal rights of women, gays and minorities.
It's politics connect to traditional conservatives and libertarians, and are likened to the "identitarian" movement in Europe.
Bannon's Breitbart News, launched in 2007, became the media hub of the sprawling movement, their support eventually rendering Trump a default figurehead.
As "alt-right," the movement has touted itself as just a louder, consciously provocative but legitimate force in conservative politics.
But the Southern Policy Law Center, an anti-extremist research group, insists the alt-right "is pretty much the same thing as the old white supremacist right - even if it does favour suits and ties over Klan robes or faux Nazi uniforms."
SPLC counts scores of such groups under the alt-right umbrella, many of which were present in Charlottesville.
Saturday's rally was led by Richard Spencer, whose Washington-based National Policy Institute think-tank is "dedicated to the heritage, identity and future of people of European descent in the United States."
Groups they invited were openly neo-Nazi and white supremacist, such as Vanguard America, whose members chanted "blood and soil," echoing the "blut und boden" cries of Hitler's followers in the 1930s.
They also included Identity Evropa, an "identitarian" group that promotes white superiority and separatism, and the Traditionalist Workers Party, which marries a Nazi-like logo with a Christian whites-only ideology. Both are stridently anti-Semitic.
RELATED NEWS Trump condemns white nationalists over Charlottesville violence SBS World News Radio: In the United States, the under-pressure President Donald Trump has finally denounced the white nationalists at the centre of a car attack in Virginia. WATCH: Donald Trump releases their first re-election ad It's not until 2020, but Donald Trump has kicked off their re-election campaign.
Defending white southern heritage
The Charlottesville rally ostensibly focused on the planned removal of a statue of Robert E. Lee, the general who led the south in the 1860s Civil War.
That attracted another alt-right type, southerners committed to preserving an idealized, heroic - and white - tradition of the South.
They reject the notion that the war was about slavery, and are fighting the elimination of symbols of that racist legacy, like the Confederate flag of the Lee monuments.
To Jason Kessler, a Charlottesville organizer of the rally, the statue's removal represents "white genocide."
Also taking part was the League of the South, which encourages white families to "secede" from "post-Christian culture in America," and Confederate Riders of America, a biker group that says southern culture is "under attack."
Skinheads and militiamen
Alt-right rallies increasingly attract groups determined to pick fights, including the Proud Boys and the DIY Division, also called the Rise Above Movement. Both allegedly have roots in the violent neo-Nazi skinheads of the 1980s and white nationalist prison gangs.
But also taking part in Charlottesville were so-called patriot-militia groups.
There are some 165 of these across the country, according to the SPLC, well-armed but focused more on grudges with the government, regulations and taxes and less concerned about issues of race. Some actively seek members from minorities, and disdain neo-Nazi ideas as anti-American.
The most prominent of these groups is the Oath Keepers, formed by former members of the military to "defend the Constitution" with a strongly libertarian ideology.
Yet the presence of militia at alt-right rallies is worrisome. Some clearly have white-power leanings.
In 2014 and 2015, they appeared heavily armed at anti-police rallies in Ferguson, Missouri, appearing to many as a self-appointed force ready to repress African American protesters.
In Charlottesville, they came well-armed, in camouflage fatigues, wielding AR-15 assault rifles, also seemingly to protect the other hardline rightists.
Yet, according to Sunshine, they took no part in the violence, and moved away when fighting broke out.

MUMBAI (Reuters) - Bandhan Bank Ltd's initial public offering (IPO) to raise 44.73 billion rupees ($686 million) was subscribed nearly 15 times on Monday as the biggest market debut ever by an Indian bank drew strong interest, mainly from institutional investors.

Investors bid for about 1.22 billion shares, or 14.63 times the 83.5 million on offer during the three-day sale period that ended on Monday, stock exchange data at 1500 GMT showed.
Bandhan's IPO is the biggest for the Indian market so far this year, after a record $11 billion in fund-raising from initial share sales in 2017.
Including the Bandhan share sale, companies have lined up $2.3 billion worth of IPOs in March alone.
Kolkata-based Bandhan, formerly a microfinance company specialising in small-value loans, was one of just two companies that won bank permits from the Reserve Bank of India in 2014, the first new bank licensing process in a decade.
Its low-cost distribution model, strong growth in past years, and a net interest margin of close to 10 percent that is the highest in the Indian banking industry, attracted investors.
Some analysts have, however, said rich valuations - the upper end of the IPO price range was more than five times the bank's book value - could keep listing gains in check.
An employee of Bandhan Bank is seen behind a glass bearing the bank's logo inside a branch office in Kolkata, March 8, 2018. REUTERS/Rupak De Chowdhuri/Files
The shares are set to begin trading on or around March 27.
Relatively lower banking penetration in India's rural areas, home to nearly 70 percent of the country's 1.3 billion people, is positive for Bandhan's banking model, which should also get a boost from more people putting their money in banks or financial products rather than saving cash or investing it in gold or real estate.
The portion reserved for institutional investors in the Bandhan IPO was subscribed 38.7 times, while retail investors bid for 1.2 times the shares reserved for them.
The bank and two of its shareholders - International Finance Corp and IFC FIG - were selling about a 10 percent stake in the IPO. Sixty-five anchor investors have already committed to buy shares worth 13.42 billion rupees as part of the IPO.
Axis Capital, Goldman Sachs, JM Financial, JPMorgan and Kotak Mahindra Capital are the banks managing the IPO.
A 42.3 billion-rupee IPO in state-run military aircraft maker Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd was subscribed about 45 percent by the second day of the sale. The IPO closes for subscriptions on Tuesday.

ISLAMABAD - Opposition parties, including PPP, staged a token walkout from the Senate to protest the delay of merging Federally Administered Tribal Areas (Fata) with the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province. The Senate was met in the chair of Deputy Chairman Maulana Abdul Ghafoor Haideri.
Rising on a point of order, Senator Ilyas Bilour from the Awami National Party (ANP) criticised the government for not implementing the reforms recommended by the Special Committee headed by Adviser on Foreign Affairs Sartaj Aziz to bring Fata at par with rest of the country.
Senator Bilour warned the government of violence and bloodshed if it failed to implement the Fata reforms before March 12, a deadline given by members of parliament from the Fata to take over key government institutions, including Prime Minister Secretariat in Islamabad to press for acceptance of their demand.
These MPs had organised a tribal convention on rights of Fata in Islamabad earlier this month which demanded immediate merger of Fata with the KP. Senator Ilyas Bilour announced their walkout as protest and rest of the opposition parties followed him. They returned to the House after a Senator from the ruling PML-N went after them and succeeded in persuading them to call off their protest.
Senator Ilyas was supported by Senator Azam Khan Swati from Pakistan Tehreek–i-Insaf (PTI), saying their ruling party in KP has already supported the demand of Fata tribesmen to merger the tribal region with KP. They said they are at loss to understand as to why the government is shying away from accepting this demand.
Senator Sirajul Haq, Chief of Jamaat Islami also supported Fata merger with Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and urged the government not to waste this historic opportunity mainstreaming the Fata by bringing them at par with other parts of the country. They were of the view that people Fata region which consists of 27000 square kilometres is not less than a prison; therefore, government should merge the Fata with KP without further delay.
On the other hand, the PML-N dominated treasures remained indifferent except Senator Sardar Musakhel from Balochistan stood on a point of order and said only people of Fata have right to decide about their future. Sardar Musakhel called upon the government to implement the Fata reforms first before any hasty decision about Fata merger with the said province.
Later, the Senate also disposed of a call attention notice moved by Muhammad Azam Khan Swati about problems being faced by thousands of domestic, commercial and industrial consumers across Hazara Division due to closing down of 120 CNG stations in the area.
Responding to the call attention notice, Minister for Parliamentary Affairs Shaikh Aftab Ahmad told the House that CNG stations were closed for some period due to low gas pressure in wake of intense cold. They said now situation has turned normal and there is no shortage of gas either for domestic or commercial consumers in the area.
Moreover, four bills were introduced before the House by Law Minister Zahid Hamid while Minister for Inter-Provincial Coordination Riaz Hussain Pirzada laid before the House Annual Report of the Council of Common Interests for the Financial Year 2015-16.
Earlier, during the Question Hour, the Senate was informed that 75 per cent of the total amount under China-Pakistan Economic Corridor is investment. Minister for Planning and Development Ahsan Iqbal said bulk of CPEC projects are related to energy to make Pakistan self-reliant in this sector.
They said all the investments under CPEC have not come through Pakistan's national exchequer and investors are directly investing in energy sector whereas the government is to buy power from them.
Similarly, they said that Chinese government award infrastructure project to the lowest bidder and Pakistan has nothing to do with this procedure. To another question, Minister for Science and Technology Rana Tanvir Hussain told the House that packed liquid milk has now been included in the mandatory list of Pakistan Standards and Quality Control Authority to ensure quality of the milk.
They said after evaluation of the laboratory results and conformity assessment compliance, licenses will be issued to the units to process milk for packaging. They said open market sampling has also been conducted to check quality of the milk through testing by laboratories. The House was adjourned to meet again on Wednesday.
CARICOM Chairman and President of Guyana, David Granger, has said the community is deeply distressed at the violence which broke out in Dominica following a public meeting on Tuesday, February 7.
“CARICOM recognizes the right of citizens to engage in peaceful protest. However, the Community condemns the vandalism which resulted in the destruction of private property and businesses,” Granger said in a statement.
They stated that CARICOM urges all “to act with restraint and maintain the orderly and peaceful society to which Dominicans and the wider Community are accustomed.”
CARICOM is a grouping of 20 countries consisting of 15 Member States and five Associate Members. Dominica is part of CARICOM.
On February 7, violence engulfed Roseau following a public meeting by opposition parties which demanded the resignation of Prime Minister, Roosevelt Skerrit, and their cabinet because of their governance style.

* China pushing ahead with C919 to enter global jet market
* Not many sales deals expected at show after yr-end rush -analyst
* Southeast Asian defence spending rising in response to China
By Jamie Freed
SINGAPORE, Feb 2 (Reuters) - Strong airline profits and higher defence spending have boosted the outlook for aerospace firms gathering for next week's Singapore Airshow, but after a surge of activity in 2017 the event is expected to produce few big-ticket deals.
The biennial show, the largest in Asia, will bring together buyers and sellers against the backdrop of China's attempt to play a bigger role in a realigning global aerospace industry.
The Chinese push into the commercial jet and military drone markets comes amid regional insecurity in Southeast Asia over its rising power while the United States is retreating toward “America First” oriented policies.
China was looking to get a leg up in commercial jet technology through a deal with Bombardier Inc over the advanced C Series last year, but the Canadian company instead chose to partner with Airbus SE.
The Airbus-Boeing duopoly could be further solidified if Boeing and Brazil's Embraer SA agree to a tie-up that could involve their commercial and defence divisions.
China, with its narrow-body C919, is not the only country trying to carve out space in the tightly controlled commercial market. Russia's Irkut MC-21 and Japan's Mitsubishi Regional Jet are also seeking to become serious competitors, and will be represented at the airshow like their Chinese rival.
But all three projects have faced delays, and significant question marks remain over whether any will gain a solid order base outside their home markets.
The C919, which has received 785 orders to date, looks the strongest because of its backing by Chinese airlines and lessors, said DVB Bank head of aviation research Bert van Leeuwen.
“They have the market, the money and the ambitions,” they said of China.
FASTEST GROWING AVIATION MARKET
Manufacturers are targeting the Asia-Pacific region for product sales and services because it is the world's fastest growing aviation market.
Airbus and Boeing are sending the heads of their services divisions to Singapore as they look to increase their presence in the maintenance, repair and operations industry.
But on the sales side, a final push late last year by legendary Airbus commercial sales head John Leahy before they retired has pulled orders forward and is expected to result in a weak start to the year.
“I‘m not expecting much,” DVB Bank's van Leeuwen said of Singapore Airshow orders. “I wouldn't be disappointed if there are few orders or if the whole year in 2018 doesn't bring many orders because this is an industry where there is an eight-year backlog of production.”
The buzz around product launches - a big sales driver at airshows - is expected to be missing at the Singapore event as Boeing's keenly watched decision on introducing a potential new mid-market airplane is not expected until later in 2018.
BIG AIR FORCE BUDGETS
On the military side, Southeast Asian countries are bolstering their air forces amid insecurity over China's rise and its increasingly assertive stance in the South China Sea.
The Republic of Singapore Air Force, Southeast Asia's biggest spender and a potential future Lockheed Martin Corp F-35 customer, celebrates its 50th anniversary this year and will launch the festivities at the airshow.
North Korea's ballistic missile programme and potential internal instability in some Southeast Asian countries are also lifting budgets, although in other cases political events, such as an upcoming election in Malaysia, could push back buying decisions.
China's Chengdu Aircraft Industry Group will be displaying two versions of its Wing Loong reconnaissance and strike drones at the show in hopes of penetrating the Asian market. However, it may be too early for Chinese products to gain much traction at a time when the Trump administration is calling on military attaches and diplomats to boost U.S. arms sales.
“I think few countries are going to buy much from China,” said Richard Bitzinger, a senior fellow at Singapore's S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies.
“Partly it is a reliability thing and partly it is ‘if you really want to keep the United States engaged, you buy their weapons systems'. In a sense it is still the U.S.'s market to lose.” (Reporting by Jamie Freed; Editing by Muralikumar Anantharaman)

The Blood Centre of Indus Hospital Wednesday launched its first Mobile Blood Donation Unit to ensure timely and safe delivery of blood for needy patients at nine different hospitals in Karachi. The event coincided with World Blood Donor Day 2017 with the theme “Give Blood, Give Now, Give Often,” and attended by hematologists and officials associated with the Sindh Blood Transfusion Authority. Dr. Abdul Bari, one of the pioneers of Patients' Welfare Association of Dow Medical College that promoted the culture of voluntary blood donation in the metropolis on the occasion referred to the objective of Indus Hospital Blood Centre. Mentioning that Indus Hospital started its Blood Centre in 2013, they said the facility collects and provides free of cost, safe blood to patients in nine hospitals. “Our objective is to provide the safest possible blood, meeting all international standards, to all segments of the society without any discrimination,” said the doctor and CEO Indus Hospital. The hospital, they said, promotes voluntary blood donation as this is the only way to collect safe blood. “In order to reach out to the donors from different corners of the city, TIH has launched its first air-conditioned mobile blood donation unit,” they said. The unit comprises two interview rooms; four beds and a waiting area to accommodate 10 donors. Government officials, quoting the WHO, said country's annual blood requirement is approximately 1.5 million bags and that 40 percent of the demand is being met by public sector. About 80 percent of private sector blood transfusion, they said, takes place in major cities, including Karachi and Lahore. Blood transfusion services in the country are mostly hospital-based with nearly 170 public and about 450 private blood banks across the country.

Iowa State tackle Jake Campos is even more anxious for the new season to begin. The former West Des Moines Valley standout entered last season as the Cyclones most experienced offensive lineman. But a broken leg in fall camp ended their season before it began and Campos hopes to lead an improved offensive line.
“We are coming together more than I have seen from our lines in the past”, said Campos. “This group is a real tight knit group and everyone feeds off each other in a very positive way. I think we are going to do very well.”
With experience at quarterback, receiver and running back Campos says the Cyclones have the skill needed to make major strides.
“It is great to have those people because we have got some of the best playmakers in our conference ands all we have got to do is give them a chance and they will make us look real good”, added Campos. That's a real good thing to have as an offensive line.”
Iowa State opens September 2 against Northern Iowa.

COLOMBO, Feb 2 (Reuters) - German insurer Allianz SE on Friday entered into an agreement with Janashakthi Insurance Plc to acquire 100 percent of the latter's subsidiary Janashakthi General Insurance Ltd for 16.4 billion rupees ($106.4 million).
Shares in Janashakthi jumped 27.5 percent on Friday, and were up 72.7 percent for the week.
With this acquisition, Allianz Insurance Lanka, the local arm of Allianz, becomes one of the country's largest general insurers with a market share of around 20 percent, a joint statement from the companies said.
Ceylinco Insurance and state-run Sri Lanka Insurance Corp (SLIC) have been leaders in the general insurance sector with market shares of 19.2 percent and 19.1 percent respectively as of 2016, a government report showed.
Zakri Khir, a member of Allianz Asia's executive board, said the deal has put the company in a very good position as the combined entity would take them very close to the top of the sector.
“Now we can compete with the market leader,” they told Reuters, adding that they are looking for strategic investments in Asia. ($1 = 154.1000 Sri Lankan rupees) (Reporting by Shihar Aneez and Ranga Sirilal; Editing by Sunil Nair and David Goodman)
So far this season, the Toronto Maple Leafs have successfully absorbed the frustrating lessons they learned in blowing third period leads a year ago. In fact, Toronto — as they jetted off to Philadelphia to begin a three week period dominated by road games — are a perfect 12-0 when leading after two period this season. Contrast that to a full season, 31-1-9 mark with third period leads last year. Those nine losses when leading in the third period were a league-worst last season. Part of that was an NHL-worst eight shootout losses. “Just more experience,” Morgan Rielly said Sunday, after the Leafs held onto a 1-0 win over Edmonton, regarding the team's improved performance in playing with leads. “I don't think the mindset has changed. The approach feels about the same. Just being more comfortable in those positions, having that experience last year helps a lot of guys.”

Another sign of the Leafs' discipline and maturity this season? Exactly half of their 20 wins have come on the road. Both the road discipline and the lead-protecting will come under the spotlight in the next three weeks. Nine of the Leafs' 12 games this month are on the road. “That's a good sign for how we're playing,” defenceman Ron Hainsey said of the Leafs' road performance. “We don't feel we have a group here that's concerned about going on the road or playing at home. We like to go out there, hopefully get off to good starts, get the lead. It's a lot easier to play that way.”
The game Tuesday against a Flyers club that has won three straight, and the heavy dose of road games over the rest of the month, should provide another test of the Leafs abilities to win road games and protect leads. “I think we're playing the game we want to play. Last year, we played that but we were a little nervous as well with all the young guys we have on our team. Everyone has more experience. We are all hungry to win. I think that's the difference,” Marner said. Players often say that successfully playing while holding a lead is a learned skill. For the Leafs, the improvements come without an appreciable difference in their shot totals. They were outshot in almost every period this season and last (the sole exception being the except for the second period in the 2016-17 season). Toronto, after getting outscored 81-71 in the third period a year ago, have outscored their opponents 41-28 in the third so far this season. “Just getting better at the situation more. More experience with that. That comes along, especially with a young team. I think we stepped up and got better,” said goalie Freddie Andersen, who is also a pivotal factor in the club's performance with leads and on the road. The performance has come with key players like Auston Matthews, Mitch Marner and William Nylander in what at first might seem like scoring droughts. But those players are learning to play without the puck, and learning to play in the neutral zone, where the art of lead protection usually happens. Matthews has also been dealing with injuries. They dropped off from nine goals in October, to six in November, and none in three games this month. The star centre, who missed four games last month with an upper-body injury, missed a fifth Sunday after colliding with Rielly Saturday in Pittsburgh. The immediate thought after the Saturday collision was that Matthews suffered a head related injury. But while they left the ice a little hunched over, they finished out the game. Leafs coach Mike Babcock sounded positive with regards to Matthews' availability for Tuesday's game in Philadelphia. The Leafs have won all five game without their top scorer and centre.

Galectins are a family of proteins that have become a promising source of cancer research in recent years. A representative thereof is galectin-1. It sits on the surface of all human cells; on tumor cells, however, it occurs in enormous quantities. This makes it an interesting target for diagnostics and therapy.
“Among other things, it is known that galectin-1 hides the tumor cells from the immune system,” explains Professor Jürgen Seibel of the Institute of Organic Chemistry at the Julius-Maximilians-Universität (JMU) Würzburg in Bavaria, Germany. Recent studies have shown that when Galectin-1 is blocked, the immune system can recognize the tumor and attack it with T cells.
Sugar molecule with docking station
No wonder, therefore, that galectin-1 has become a major focus of research. Seibel and their colleague Dr. Clemens Grimm is interested in a very specific section of this protein, the so-called carbohydrate recognition domain. They have now designed a complex sugar molecule that fits perfectly into this domain, as the scientists report in journal ChemBioChem.
“We have equipped the sugar molecule with a docking site, for example, to connect it with a fluorescent dye or an drug,” says Seibel. In addition, the scientists have described the binding of their molecule to galectin-1 with high-resolution X-ray structure analyzes.
“Our findings can serve the development of high-affinity ligands of the protein Galectin-1 and thus of new drugs,” said Clemens Grimm.
Quick test for Galectin-1 in progress
Now the JMU scientists are working on a rapid test for the detection of galectin-1. It is designed to enable early detection of tumors such as neuroblastoma. For the future, Seibel's team would like to expand the sugar molecules into a kind of shuttle system that allows pharmaceutical agents to be transported directly to the tumors.
Dozens of youth will march the streets of Peterborough on Good Friday for the re-enactment of Way of the Cross.
The 14th annual event sees youth retrace the steps of Jesus Christ leading up to their crucifixion. Organized by the Diocese of Peterborough, the event will begin with a prayer service at St. Peter-in-Chains Cathedral at 10 a.m. on Good Friday, March 30.
Following the service, the procession will travel east across Hunter Street, entering East City to Rogers Street, and concluding in front of Immaculate Conception Church. There will be various stops along the route with scene re-enactments. On average, more than 1,000 spectators join the procession.

Organizer Rev. Craig Cruikshank says a team of 35 youth has been rehearsing for the event, with dozens more working behind the scenes.
“It's very rare to find anyone, especially youth, who are willing to stand up in public and express their faith,” said Rev. Cruikshank, parish priest for St. Thomas More Church in Millbrook.
“This boldness, this courage, is certainly a great witness for us all. The very fact that this project was an idea first proposed by our youth indicates just how alive faith is.”
The public is invited to participate and watch the procession. In case of inclement weather, the ceremony will be held entirely within the Cathedral.
The Diocese says there will be brief road closures during the event.

Benje Choucroun turned up at the White House briefing on Wednesday, catching everyone's attention when they asked Press Secretary Sarah Sanders about school shootings.
"At my school, we recently had a lockdown drill," Choucron, 13, said, reading from a piece of paper. "One thing that affects mine and others' mental health is the worry that we or our friends could get shot at school."
Choucron, a student at Marin Country Day School in California, continued: "Specifically, can you tell me what the administration has done and will do to prevent these senseless tragedies?"
Sanders appeared to tear up during their response.

UNA Professor Honored with Nation's Highest Geography Teaching Award
FLORENCE, Ala. – Dr. Michael Pretes, University of North Alabama professor of geography, is the 2017 recipient of the American Association of Geographers Distinguished Teaching Honors.
The AAG is the largest academic and professional organization for geographers in the United States, and it awards honors in several categories for “outstanding accomplishment.” Its Distinguished Teaching Honors are the highest recognition given for teaching geography. As the AAG notes, AAG Honors are “among the most prestigious awards in American geography.”
Pretes is being honored for “his contributions to geographic education both within and outside the classroom.”  They are described as “an exemplary teacher-scholar” and noted for their “ability to instill a love and respect for geography in their students.”
They will receive the award at the AAG national meeting in Boston in April. This award reflects not only Pretes's personal achievement, but is also recognition for the outstanding work of the UNA Department of Geography, the UNA College of Arts and Sciences, and UNA overall.
Pretes received the Southeastern Geographers (SEDAAG) Excellence in Teaching Award in 2015, and was the recipient of UNA's Phi Kappa Phi Eleanor Gaunder Excellence in Teaching Award in 2013.
A prominent white nationalist website that promoted a Virginia rally that ended in deadly violence Saturday is losing its Internet domain host.
GoDaddy tweeted late Sunday night that it has given the Daily Stormer 24 hours to move its domain to another provider because the site has violated the Scottsdale, Ariz.-based company's terms of service.
The site's labeling of a woman killed in an attack at the event in Charlottesville as “fat” and “childless” prompted the move, according to GoDaddy spokesperson Dan Race. Heather Heyer was killed Saturday when police say a man plowed their car into a group of demonstrators protesting the white nationalist rally.
“Given their latest article comes on the immediate heels of a violent act, we believe this type of article could incite additional violence, which violates our terms of service,” Race said in an emailed statement.
Shortly after GoDaddy tweeted its decision, the site posted an article claiming it had been hacked and would be shut down.

Jazz maestro Kamasi Washington will release their new double album, Heaven and Earth, in just under one month's time. After previewing the 16-track collection with the songs “Fists of Fury” and “The Space Travelers Lullaby”, he's back today with another taste of Heaven entitled, “Street Fighter Mas”.
And yes, that's a reference to the classic fighting video game. According to a statement, a young Washington used to go to the Rexall arcade in their neighborhood and do battle with the local OGs on Street Fighter. “It was the one place that was like an equalizer. It was just about how good you were at Street Fighter… for the most part,” Washington said. “In other places, you were afraid of these dudes; there, you would just play the game and it was what it was, you know?” They continued,
“In a lot of ways, for me, video games was the way I connected with them because I was never affiliated with any gangs, but I knew them and I was cool with them and that was mainly through the video games. At an older age I thought how amazing would it be if the OGs could just play the game and solve their problems that way. The meaning within the scope of the record is a connection to the past and all of the many ways we can connect.”
Take a listen to “Street Fighter Mas”, which Washington envisions as their arcade entrance music, below.
Washington also shared a preview of the A.G. Rojas-directed video for the track, which you can watch below.
Heaven and Earth is out June 22nd. Washington is currently previewing the effort on their European tour, after which he'll head out on a full North American summer/fall trek. They also have a few dates lined up in October playing with Florence and The Machine, on whose upcoming High as Hope they appear.

The Oroville Dam spillway releases 2,830 cubic metres of water per second down the main spillway in Oroville, California, on Monday. Almost 200,000 people were under evacuation orders in northern California Monday after a threat of catastrophic failure at the tallest dam in the U.S. ( JOSH EDELSON / AFP/GETTY IMAGES )
In 2005, three environmental groups warned California and U.S. federal officials about what they believed was a problem with the Oroville Dam's emergency spillway, the same one that was at risk of collapsing this week after storms caused the adjacent reservoir to swell. The groups' concern, which seemed to have fallen on deaf ears at the time: The emergency spillway is not really a spillway. Rather, it's a 520-metre-long concrete weir that empties into a dirt hillside. That means in the event of severe flooding, water would erode that hillside and flood nearby communities in northern California's gold country, the groups said then. That nearly happened Sunday, when a hole in the emergency spillway threatened catastrophic floods and prompted officials to evacuate nearly 200,000 residents, who remain uncertain when they'll be allowed to return to their homes – especially with three storms lined up to drench northern California over the next week. The National Weather Service's Sacramento office said Tuesday rain was expected to move through late Wednesday and Thursday morning, with 5 to 10 centimetres in the foothills and mountains. But the storm is looking colder than initially projected, meaning lower snow levels and less runoff into Sierra reservoirs than the storms last week.

The brunt of a Friday storm appeared to be headed toward southern California, with lighter rain in the north. Emergency crews were working Tuesday to fill a hole in the emergency spillway for flood-water from the dam. A California dam inspector said authorities may never know the exact causes of the earth and concrete blow-outs below the Lake Oroville dam. Eric Holland of the state Department of Water Resources' dam-safety division said any of a number of different problems could have caused the spillway troubles. Authorities often never discover in these cases what exactly happened, they said, because flood water has washes out everything at the scene.

In October 2005, as the Oroville Dam was going through a re-licensing process, the three groups filed a motion urging a federal regulatory agency to require state officials to armour the emergency spillway with concrete so that, in the event of extreme rain and flooding, water would not freely cascade down and erode the hillside. The upgrade would have cost millions of dollars and no one wanted to foot the bill, said Ronald Stork, senior policy advocate for Friends of the River, one of the groups that filed the motion. “When the dam is overfull, water goes over that weir and down the hillside, taking much of the hillside with it,” Stork said. “That causes huge amounts of havoc. There are roads, there's transmission lines, power lines that are potentially in the way of that water going down that auxiliary spillway.” Federal officials, however, determined that nothing was wrong and the emergency spillway, which can handle 9,910 cubic metres of water per second, “would perform as designed” and sediment resulting from erosion would be insignificant, according to a July 2006 memo from John Onderdonk, then a senior civil engineer for the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. “The emergency spillway meets FERC's engineering guidelines for an emergency spillway,” Onderdonk wrote. “The guidelines specify that during a rare flood event, it is acceptable for the emergency spillway to sustain significant damage.” Fast-forward 11 years. The erosion of the emergency spillway became severe, with only up to 340 cubic metre of water per second, according to the Oroville Mercury Register. That's a little more than 3 per cent of what officials said the spillway can handle. The water level in massive Lake Oroville rose significantly after potentially record-setting rain surged through the state following a long drought. The Oroville Dam, the tallest in the country, at 235 metres, remains stable, officials said as the water level fell about a metre, to a point at which water was no longer spilling over. But the structure of the spillways, which are designed to release water from the reservoir in a controlled fashion, have crumbled. On Monday night, Democratic Gov. Jerry Brown requested federal assistance, noting in a letter to President Donald Trump that “officials are aggressively attempting to lower Lake Oroville's water levels, as another atmospheric river storm system is scheduled to arrive within 48 hours.” The emergency, Brown wrote, is “of such severity and magnitude that continued effective response is beyond the capabilities of the state and affected local governments and supplemental federal assistance is necessary to save lives and to protect property, public health and safety, and to lessen the effects of this serious situation.”
Monday was the second night that Oroville evacuee Verna Chadwick, 24, and son Raiden Ellis, 10 months, spent in the community hall in Bangor, California. Evacuees remain uncertain when they'll be allowed to return to their homes – especially with three storms lined up to drench northern California over the next week. ( Brian van der Brug/ Los Angeles Times )
This month, a portion of the main spillway – a 915-metre-long structure lined in concrete – eroded because of the high volume of water spilling over from the reservoir, creating a craterlike hole. Officials with the California Department of Water Resources, which owns and operates the dam and reservoir, then decided to use the adjacent emergency spillway for the first time since the dam was built nearly 50 years ago. Sheets of water began spilling over the emergency spillway and onto the hillside, carrying mud and debris into the nearby Feather River. The emergency spillway appeared to be working as expected – until Sunday, when officials spotted a hole. That raised fears of a catastrophic flood that could wipe away Oroville, a town of 16,000 people, and prompted officials to evacuate nearly 200,000 area residents. Stork said they believe none of that would have happened had officials listened to their and others' concerns and built a proper emergency spillway 12 years ago. The two other groups that filed the 2005 motion are the Sierra Club and the South Yuba River Citizens League. “They told us not to worry. All was good. Everything was fine. It's all safe,” Stork said. “First of all, they're not supposed to fail. That's not what we do in a first-world country. We don't do that. We certainly don't do that with the nation's tallest dam. An auxiliary spillway isn't supposed to cause lots of havoc when it's being used.” Construction would have cost at least $100 million, Stork said, and the state contractors in southern California that buy water from northern California would have been forced to pay for it. The Metropolitan Water District of Southern California, which provides water to 19 million people in Los Angeles, San Diego and other areas, and the State Water Contractors would have shouldered the cost and deemed the upgrades unnecessary, according to the Oroville Mercury Register. “The people who are bearing the personal risk of being killed and having their homes washed away are the people of Northern California,” Stork said. Pressed during a news conference Monday about the 2005 motion, Bill Croyle, acting director of the Department of Water Resources, said they were not familiar with the conversations that happened then. “It's the first time it's ever taken water,” Croyle said of the emergency spillway. “We don't know exactly why this erosion occurred.” With files from The Associated Press

TORONTO — Ontario Premier Kathleen Wynne sued the Opposition leader for defamation Monday, less than six months away from the June provincial election.
The legal action stems from comments Progressive Conservative Leader Patrick Brown made in September, a day before Wynne testified as a witness at a trial in Sudbury, Ont., involving two provincial Liberals facing Election Act bribery charges.
Brown told reporters they hoped Wynne would give answers about the scandal “maybe when they stand trial” and went on to describe them as a “sitting premier, sitting in trial.”
The premier was not on trial and had waived parliamentary privilege in order to testify as a witness.
The Tory leader refused to apologize for the statements both after an initial letter from Wynne's lawyer and following a libel notice in October, saying they would “ignore their baseless legal threat.” Their lawyer has said the statements were not defamatory.
Wynne's legal team filed a statement of claim in court Monday that seeks $100,000 in general, aggravated, exemplary and punitive damages. Brown's statements harmed Wynne's reputation, they wrote.
“The deliberate, malicious conduct of the defendant in publishing the defamatory statements is part of an ongoing campaign engineered by the defendant and others to harm the plaintiff's reputation,” Wynne's lawyers wrote.
“The defendant's egregious misconduct in publishing statements that they knew to be false, their ongoing refusal to retract these false statements, and their high-handed and oppressive conduct in stating to media and directly to the world at large that the plaintiff's complaints were baseless and would be ignored, all justify an award of aggravated, exemplary and punitive damages against the defendant.”
Wynne's spokesperson said the statement of claim was filed to preserve the premier's ability to continue with the legal case.
“We continue to remain hopeful that this issue can be resolved with an apology from Patrick Brown for their defamatory remarks,” Jenn Beaudry wrote. “It should be that simple. However, if they continue to refuse to apologize we will have the ability to continue legal action.”
Brown has not yet filed a statement of defence.
Progressive Conservative Bill Walker also made remarks in September suggesting the premier was under investigation and facing charges in connection with the Sudbury bribery trial. They apologized hours after receiving a letter from Wynne's lawyers.
“Mr. Walker's apology and retraction were widely reported in the media and there can be no doubt that the situation was extensively discussed by (Brown) and their staff,” Wynne's lawyers wrote.
“As a result, the defendant was fully aware that the Walker statements were false, and that Mr. Walker had retracted them and issued a public apology.”
The two Liberals on trial in Sudbury were ultimately acquitted.
Wynne previously sued the former Progressive Conservative leader, Tim Hudak, and another Tory member of provincial parliament after the pair said they oversaw — and possibly ordered — the destruction of documents related to two cancelled gas plants. Those are allegations for which two McGuinty-era staffers are on trial and awaiting a judge's decision.
That lawsuit was resolved in 2015, though it is not known whether it was settled or withdrawn.
ISLAMABAD, Jul 04 (APP):The Supreme Court on Wednesday sought details of foreign assets of formers presidents Asif Ali Zardari and General (retd) Pervez Musharraf and former attorney general Justice (retd) Malik Qayyum while hearing a sou moto case pertaining to the National Reconciliation Ordinance (NRO).
A three-judge bench headed by Chief Justice of Pakistan Mian Saqib Nisar passed the directions while hearing the suo moto case. Under the NRO issued by then president Musharraf in 2007 granted amnesty to politicians and other individuals, by quashing corruption and criminal cases against them so they could return to the country.
During the course of proceedings, the CJP observed that the court should be taken into confidence regarding the ownership of foreign accounts and assets by individuals.
The Attorney General for Pakistan and Zardari's counsel Farooq H Naek attended the court proceedings.
The chief justice remarked,”We have to make dams and other bigger projects, including ending of corruption”.
It may add that nominating Musharraf, Zardari and former attorney general Qayyum as respondents, petitioner Feroz Shah Gilani had requested the court in April this year to order recovery of ‘huge amounts of public money' misappropriated and wasted by them through unlawful means ‘already on record in different judgments of the Supreme Court and high courts.
They had contended that Musharraf subverted the Constitution by declaring emergency followed by the promulgation of NRO, through which criminal and corruption cases against politicians, including Zardari, were ‘arbitrarily withdrawn' causing huge financial losses to the national exchequer.
Sam Houston's chapter of LULAC hosted a DACA (or Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals) informational meeting on Sept. 28 to educate those who are affected by DACA and also dispel any misinformation that students may have had. Different speakers discussed resources those affected could utilize and how to reach and learn about your representatives.
Dean Abbey Zink of CHSS opened the meeting by describing the event and how it was not a space for debate but for information, and as educators, it is their responsibility to make sure people know what is out there and how to find it. They then gave the floor to Miranda Estrada, president of SHSU LULAC who further discussed DACA and what that means.
DACA is a policy created by executive action, created by the Obama administration in 2012 that gave two year permits to immigrants that came to the United States as children, to work and study in the United States. This policy was rescinded by the Trump administration on Sept. 5 of this year.
Estrada gave important statistics about DACA that disproved many people's conceptions about who is covered by DACA and who can be approved. All DACA recipients have no criminal record at the time of issuance, you are not able to apply for DACA if you do, and 91 percent of DACA recipients are employed.
Estrada also explained that it is not a path to citizenship, and does not apply to any immigrant who came to the U.S illegally. It is specifically for immigrants who came to the U.S before they turned 16, and were under the age of the 31 when the policy was created. Recipients must give lived in the U.S. since 2007, and were currently present in the U.S. at the time of application. They also must have been in school, graduated from high school or obtained a GED, or been honorably discharged from the military.
After Estrada gave their presentation, Glenn Sanford, the Associate Dean of CHSS, gave another. They reiterated basic facts about DACA, but spent more time dealing with the legal logistics of what had happened, why it could happen, and what those affected could do now that they were tasked with reapplying with the very solid time restraint.
“Any law by executive action means there's no permanence. It only lasts until the next president comes along and decides to change it,” Sanford said.
Sanford also explained that while there was some uncertainty as to what the President and their administration were going to do about DACA, they expressed that those involved and others be adaptable to the situation. As for right now, the best thing to do is to focus on the renewal deadline of Oct. 5.
The process and cost of filing is difficult and expensive; however, Sanford gave several different resources of where to go for help in filing and other legal assistance.
Student and Legal Mediation Services, SHSU's Counseling Center, Houston Immigrants Right Hotline and the Texas Bar Association, among others are all dedicated to assisting in the situation.
Sanford also directly showed the audience how to find out who your representatives are, how you can find their pages, contact them, and learn more about who they are.
The last speaker was Professor of Psychology, Craig Henderson. They discussed the importance of mental health. They gave recommendations to maintain a healthy mindset during a very difficult situation, such as practicing self-care, talking to someone about it, whether that person is friendly or professional does not matter. The important thing is the actual discussion.
Another suggestion was setting up a regular routine, and taking care of your body. Exercising and avoiding drugs and alcohol would help those affected and help them avoid looking to ‘numb' themselves, instead of dealing with it.
Henderson also made sure to let the audience know of resources they could go to, such as the Counseling Center and Psychological Services, where you can receive free counseling sessions. Henderson also stressed that even if those who needed more help or could not be helped by the offices, they would assist in finding someone who could.
Dean Abbey Zink closed the event by thanking those in attendance and those who presented. Zink described the role of educating and the campus' dedication to making sure that their students were taken care.
They also pleaded that no matter what, students should stay in school.
“We may not know the answers, but we can pick up the phone and find them,” Zink said.
They then thanked the organizations that were there, such as LULAC, their sponsor and the Diversity and Inclusion Committee for making events such as these possible.
CALGARY—About 100 people are out of their homes after an overnight four-alarm fire that extensively damaged their Calgary condominium. A total of 64 suites were evacuated when the fire broke out early Wednesday morning at the four-storey complex in the southeast neighbourhood of Inglewood. There were no injuries and residents say a group of neighbours went around pounding on doors telling everyone to get out.

Eight engines and four ladder trucks were called to the scene and a neighbouring condo was also evacuated as crews fought to keep the flames from spreading. Fire officials say there's heavy damage to the top floor of the complex, while floors below have water damage. The cause of the fire is under investigation but residents say the blaze appeared to start on a fourth-floor balcony.

“It was frightening for us because we're older people and we wanted to be sure everybody is out,” said resident Pat Tetley. “We've had alarms before go off, and people take them for granted. Once you saw the fire, you know this is time to leave.” Tetley's wife, Jane, said some of their neighbours were handing out coffee, blankets and even pairs of shoes once everyone was outside. “People just ran out with nothing on their feet, so we're very grateful this isn't the middle of winter,” they said. The exterior of an adjacent building was also damaged. Calgary fire Chief Steve Dongworth said it's too early to determine the cause of the fire.

India loses to US in campaign opener
IANS
NEW DELHI
India's campaign at the FIFA Under-17 World Cup got off to a poor start as they suffered a 0-3 defeat to the United States in a Group A match here on Friday.
Josh Sargent (30th minute) put the US in the lead by converting a penalty in the first half.
Chris Durkin (51st) and Andrew Carleton (84th) rounded off the tally after the break.
The Indians gave a good account of themselves in the first half although the visitors dominated from start to finish and should have scored within the first 10 minutes.
India's star winger Komal Thatal was superb down the left, repeatedly troubling the American defenders with their dribbling skills.
India's other winger Ninthoiganba Meetei also played well with their speedy runs down the right. Abhijit Sarkar also did well in the midfield.
Indian goalkeeper Dheeraj Moirangthem was in superb form, coming up with several superb saves to reduce the margin of defeat.
The hosts played a defensive, counter-attacking style with Aniket Jadhav as the lone striker. The Indian boys however, suffered from a lack of co-ordination in the final third which resulted in a lot of mispasses and made the job easier for the US defenders.
The Indian defence came under pressure right at the start when India goalkeeper Dheeraj Moirangthem produced a superb save to deny American striker Josh Sargent from close range. Dheeraj was called upon to make another save in the 15th minute when an attempted clearance saw the ball bounce off US winger Ayo Akinola and almost sneak in at the near post.
The US defence came under pressure in the 25th minute when India striker Aniket Jhadav dribbled into the rival penalty area and ultimately earned a corner.
The Americans took the lead when the referee inexplicably awarded a penalty after Indian defender Jitendra Singh tugged at the jersey of Sargent inside the penalty box. Sargent stepped forward to send the ball into the net as Dheeraj dived the other way.
The Americans almost doubled their lead shortly after half-time when Akinola dribbled into the penalty area and picked out Sargent inside the six-yard box.
Dheeraj however, displayed excellent reflexes to deny Sargent's close range attempt with a diving save.
The hosts however could not rejoice for long as a short while later, the Indian defence failed to clear a high ball inside the box and Durkin punished them with an impeccable finish.
The second goal seemed to affect the morale of the hosts as their defence started to make mistakes.
India got a good chance in the 56th minute when a through ball from Sarkar found Thatal whose attempt went over the bar.
India's best chance of the match came in the 84th minute when Anwar Ali's shot from outside the penalty box beat American goalkeeper Justin Garces but hit the underside of the crossbar.
But the third goal for the US came off the subsequent counter-attack as Carleton latched on to a long ball out of the American defence and rounded past Dheeraj to find the net.
Southern Methodist hired former California and Louisiana Tech coach Sonny Dykes as its new coach. They were fired by Cal after the 2016 season and spent 2017 as an offensive analyst at Texas Christian.
Dykes, 48, replaces Chad Morris, who last week was hired to be Arkansas' coach. Dykes coached quarterback Jared Goff at Cal. Goff was the No. 1 pick by the Rams in the 2016 NFL draft.
Dykes, a Texas native whose father Spike Dykes was a longtime coach at Texas Tech, went 22-15 in three seasons at Louisiana Tech from 2010-12. They spent four years at Cal, where they had just one winning season. They were fired after the 2016 season and spent last year working as an offensive analyst at TCU.
SMU has been on the rise under Morris, who took over the program when it was coming off 1-11 season. The Mustangs went 7-5 this year to reach the postseason for the first time since 2012. Morris, another Texas native and former offensive coordinator, re-established the Dallas-based school's in-state recruiting ties and brought an exciting style of offense to SMU.
Ole Miss QB headed to Michigan
Mississippi quarterback Shea Patterson said they will transfer to Michigan.
Patterson is recovering from a right knee injury that cost them the final month of the season but should be ready to compete in 2018. In seven games, Patterson passed for 2,259 yards and 17 touchdowns, with nine interceptions. The sophomore was one of the top recruits in the 2016 class.
Ole Miss was hit with NCAA sanctions two weeks ago that included a bowl ban next season. The NCAA said that Mississippi's seniors could transfer without sitting out next season, as is usually required. Patterson does not qualify for that but could petition the NCAA to be immediately eligible.
AP All-Americans named
Heisman Trophy-winning Oklahoma quarterback Baker Mayfield heads the Associated Press All-American team. Running back Ronald Jones II and cornerback Jack Jones of Pac-12 champion USC were third-team selections.
Schiano had $27-million deal with Tennesseee
Former Tennessee athletic director John Currie and Greg Schiano signed a memorandum of understanding making the Ohio State assistant the new Volunteers football coach before the deal fell apart amid a public backlash.
The memorandum of understanding, obtained through a public records request, states that Schiano would have received a six-year, $27-million contract.
Tennessee officials say they believe the document isn't legally binding because it was not signed by the school's chief financial officer.
Tennessee Chancellor Beverly Davenport also didn't sign the document with Schiano.
Currie was suspended and replaced by Phillip Fulmer on Dec. 1, five days after the Schiano deal fell through.
Fulmer took over the search and last week announced the hiring of Alabama defensive coordinator Jeremy Pruitt.
Washington
US job creation accelerated in January, as the labor market continued to absorb workers at a robust pace, unemployment clung to a record low and wages moved higher, the government said in a key report Friday.
And with a near 10-year record in wage gains, the report strengthened the case for the Federal Reserve to raise its benchmark interest rate in March, as it is widely expected to do.
The solid jobs report was a to be a measure of relief for an embattled White House, as President Donald Trump has taken credit for the extended run of good economic news amid political turmoil.
But the news, particularly the wage data, helped spark a Wall Street sell-off, with fear of rising interest rates and a widening yield curve sending the Dow Jones Industrial Average on its biggest one-day slide since June 2016.
The world's largest economy added 200,000 net new positions last month, driven by gains in construction, retail, restaurants and health care, the Labor Department said in the highly-anticipated report.
The result beat the consensus forecast among economists, which predicted an increase of 180,000.
Meanwhile, the unemployment rate remained at a 17-year low of 4.1 percent for the fourth month in a row.
Perhaps the key element of the report was average hourly earnings which continued to rise.
Hourly wages rose 0.3 percent from the prior month to $26.74, putting worker pay up 2.9 percent compared to January of last year, the largest 12-month gain since June 2009.
Over the same period the consumer price index gained 2.1 percent, seasonally adjusted, but rising wages would be expected to put more pressure on prices, and perhaps push the Fed's inflation hawks to raise rates faster.
“After two years of tracking sideways at about 2.5 percent, we can't stress enough that a sustained upside break in wage growth will greatly empower Fed hawks and weaken the doves,” Ian Shepherdson of Pantheon Macroeconomics said in a client note.
“In short, the labor market is tight, getting tighter, and employees are becoming more expensive. The question for the Fed now is whether the plan for ‘gradual' tightening will be enough if wage gains accelerate further.” At the end of a topsy-turvy week, fear of rising interest rates drove the Dow down 2.6 percent, while the broader S&P 500 and tech-heavy Nasdaq both fell about two percent.
However, Chris Low of FTN Financial cautioned against jumping to conclusions on the wage data.
Hourly wages have been “so volatile in the past 12 months it's not yet possible to determine a pattern of wage pressures,” they wrote in a client note.
The construction sector added 36,000 new positions, while restaurants and bars added 31,000 new jobs. The ranks of health care workers swelled by 21,000.
But revisions to November and December subtracted a net 24,000 positions. That brought average job creation over the last three months of the year to 192,000, beating the 2017 monthly average of 181,000.
However, the unemployment rate for African-Americans, which Trump hailed this week in their State of the Union address, rose nine tenths of a percentage point to 7.7 percent, just below the 7.8 percent in January last year.—APP
RCMP in Didsbury arrested two 17-year-olds after an incident on Thursday.
In a news release on Monday afternoon, RCMP said they were attempting a traffic stop with a suspected stolen truck on Thursday, March 15 around 8 p.m., when the driver of the truck allegedly rammed the police cruiser and pushed it out of the way.
According to police, a second police car was almost hit at the same time.
RCMP said they followed the suspected truck to Innisfail, where two occupants of the truck abandoned the vehicle and ran away.
Officers from three different towns as well as the Red Deer RCMP Police Dog Services worked together to catch the two suspects who were arrested and taken into custody.
One male youth, 17, whose name cannot be released under the Youth Criminal Justice Act is facing nine charges:
Assault on a police officer with a weapon;
Flight from police;
Dangerous driving;
Mischief;
Resisting arrest;
Possession of stolen property over $5,000;
Failure to comply with a recognizance;
Two counts of failure to comply with a probation order.
The 17-year-old female passenger of the vehicle, whose name also cannot be released under the Youth Criminal Justice Act, is facing five charges;
Possession of a weapon dangerous to the public;
Possession of break-in tools;
Possession of a prohibited weapon;
Possession of methamphetamine;
Possession of cocaine.
Both of the accused have been released from custody, with the male scheduled to appear in court on March 26 and the female on April 30.
"They were really supportive. I think it answered a lot of questions to them," Barksdale said."There are the symptoms and all that, but without proper understanding of what's going on, you just look like you have bad days where you just show up and you're miserable for whatever reason or you're angry for whatever reason. It connected a lot of the dots for them. They were super supportive.
OLD TRAFFORD may no longer boast the record Premier League attendance, Tottenham Hotspur's year in exile at Wembley having seen the national stadium assume that particular mantle.
But Manchester United's home of almost 107 years retains an aura all of its own. A seven-day-a-week tourist attraction that draws supporters in from all four corners of the globe, the self-styled ‘Theatre of Dreams' has always seemed a step ahead of the rest in this country.
Hillsborough may have had the first large-scale modern cantilevered stand, taking inspiration from Scunthorpe United's Old Show Ground. But Old Trafford's sleek United Road Stand, complete with private executive boxes, was the true trendsetter in the Sixties.
Three decades or so later, the expansion upwards on three sides meant the stadium once again towered above its English brethren in a manner similar to how United's home now dominates the south-west Manchester skyline.
The atmosphere is nothing like what it was in the days when the roar from the Stretford End was likened to a jet plane taking off at the then Ringway Airport but, for footballers, it remains a prized venue to tick off.
Many in Huddersfield Town colours will get that opportunity this afternoon, as David Wagner's men make the short trip across the Pennines to tackle United.
Among those making their maiden voyage are Danish duo, Mathias ‘Zanka' Jorgensen and Jonas Lossl. Both are relishing the chance to tread the same turf as Charlton, Best et al as the Terriers look to turn around a season that has begun to flag since the turn of the year. Neither, though, will be daunted by walking out at the 75,000 capacity arenas.
“I am looking forward to this game,” admitted goalkeeper Lossl, on loan from German club Mainz 05, to The Yorkshire Post. “It is a fixture we all looked at back in the summer.
“Spectator-wise, I am not sure if Old Trafford is the biggest I will have played at. Maybe (Borussia) Dortmund beats it. I am not certain. But this will be a huge game for us as a club and a team. We need a good result.
“By beating United already this season, we have already proved it can be done. We have to be at our very best.
“When going to the big stadiums in Germany, the key for the smaller clubs is to have a plan and then do that plan perfectly. If all goes right, you can get a fantastic result like we did against United –nd also nearly against (Manchester) City. But if it does not, then it can be like Liverpool (who Town lost 3-0 against in midweek).
“We have a chance. We must not forget that. Our team is good enough to make chances in these games so we must believe.”
Lossl's hunch that Dortmund's Westfalenstadion boasts a bigger capacity is correct, the German club being able to squeeze in almost 6,000 more than the Red Devils.
Even that, though, pales in comparison to the biggest venue Jorgensen has played at, Barcelona's 90,000 capacity Nou Camp in the Champions League.
The Town defender was in the FC Copenhagen side that took on the Catalan giants in October, 2010. Having already won their opening two group games, the Danish champions headed to Spain in buoyant mood.
Defeat would follow but Barcelona were given a fright, the game not being settled until Lionel Messi netted their second goal of the night in a 2-0 triumph deep into stoppage time.
“I have not played at Old Trafford or visited,” added Jorgensen, along with Lossl the two ever-presents in the league for Town this season.
“But I played in Camp Nou. That was a special place to play football.
“We went there, like Huddersfield will to Manchester, as the underdog. But we refused to be intimidated. Our plan was to put everything we could into the game. We played well but, unfortunately, lost 2-0. We played Barcelona again a few weeks later and drew 1-1.”
Barcelona went on to lift the trophy the following May, underlining just how well Copenhagen, beaten in the first knockout round, had performed in the autumn double-header.
Huddersfield will need a similar standard of performance against Jose Mourinho's men, who will be smarting from not only their 2-1 loss at the John Smith's Stadium in October but also Wednesday's defeat at Wembley in front of a record 81,978 crowd.
With Southampton and Swansea City, the two teams sitting directly below the fourth bottom Terriers, also in action today, even a draw at Old Trafford might not be enough to prevent Wagner's men slipping into the relegation zone for the first time.
“The league table is so close,” said Lossl, as Town look to avoid a fifth straight defeat in the league. “I can't think of one like this before, it is incredible.
“But we knew what this season would be like. If I had been told last summer that we would be in this situation, still outside the bottom three, in February then I would have said: ‘Yes, that is good'. This has been a bad run but we still believe.”
As for Jorgensen, they are steeling themselves for a tough afternoon. “Manchester United will want to beat us even more because of what happened earlier in the season. Of course, they would have wanted to win anyway. But this victory (in October) may make it a bit more.
“Going to the big stadiums is what every player enjoys. Some of the guys here were fortunate to play at Wembley last season (in the play-off final) so they will not be worried. We are all ready for the challenge.”
What's an award nominations morning without snubs? Here are the top five from the 2018 Golden Globes announcement.
- “The Big Sick,” the comedy co-written by real-life couple Kumail Nanjiani and Emily V. Gordon, was entirely ignored by the Hollywood Foreign Press Assn. on Monday. Award season pundits had predicted that the film, based on the pair's actual experience overcoming a medical emergency, would at least score a Golden Globe nomination for best comedy. It didn't, and its cast — including lead Nanjiani and supporting actor Holly Hunter — also received no nominations.
- Meanwhile, “Get Out's” Jordan Peele was snubbed too. The filmmaker did not earn recognition for directing or writing the horror satire, though the film wasn't completely overlooked — its star, Daniel Kaluuya, was nominated for best actor, and the film got a nom for best comedy.
- Also blanked in the directing category? Greta Gerwig, for their movie “Lady Bird.” Gerwig was widely expected to earn a nomination, but in fact no women were recognized as among the best director nominees. “Lady Bird” got a lot of love, otherwise: The movie was nominated for best comedy and screenplay, and its mother/daughter duo — Saoirse Ronan and Laurie Metcalf — received nods.
- Jake Gyllenhaal, who has earned high praise for their turn as Boston marathon bombing survivor Jeff Bauman in the drama “Stronger,” was also snubbed by the HFPA.
- And it wasn't a wonderful morning for “Wonder Woman,” which soared at the box office this summer but wasn't a Globes favorite: Neither director Patty Jenkins nor star Gal Gadot received nominations.

When the National Hockey League altered its Stanley Cup Playoffs format five seasons ago, the changes arguably created more problems than they solved.
It's stupid. It's the stupidest thing ever. It doesn't work. It doesn't make sense. – Daniel Winnik
Originally modified in order to generate a greater number of interdivisional clashes, the NHL's adjustments have instead created an unnecessarily complex system which fails to reward the regular season success of numerous franchises. Further, the alterations imposed have ensured that a number of the league's top teams are now eliminated in the opening round of the playoffs, effectively robbing the postseason of true best-on-best matchups in later rounds in favour of immediate regional rivalries.
What's more is that it is not only the NHL's fans who have voiced their displeasure, as general managers, as well as the players themselves, have made their perspectives regarding the format well-known. Even now as we meander towards the conclusion of the 2017-18 season, the criticism surrounding the NHL's current playoff format has once again begun to surface — serving as a painful reminder of the flawed system which looms overhead.
As a result, the time has come to propose something new and different.
In fact, it has come time for the NHL to institute major changes to its playoff format in order to reward regular season success and ensure a variety of rarely-before seen matchups in the process.
The inspiration behind these changes? The Southern Professional Hockey League.
A Fresh and Flashy Format
If you had yet to learn of the SPHL's existence, that is about to change.
Are you a fan of the NHL's 3-on-3 overtime format?
Well, you can thank the SPHL, as they were the first league to implement the thrilling overtime system and reap the immense benefits of its success. Now, the SPHL has made drastic changes to its playoff formatting — alterations which the NHL should seriously consider implementing.
SPHL announces new 2017-2018 playoff format | SPHL Southern Professional Hockey League https://t.co/tfaJxSGyRB — SPHL (@SPHL) October 16, 2017
First and foremost, let's examine the basis of the SPHL's new playoff format and how it could be applied at the NHL-level.
A Thrilling First Round
To begin, forget the presence of wild cards. In fact, toss those right out of the window.
In this endlessly enthralling format, the NHL would revert to a conference-based system which ranks teams 1-through-8 based on their respective regular season success. From this point, the teams who placed in first, second, and third place within their conference would be afforded the opportunity to choose their first-round opponent — with the top team holding priority.
“I immediately knew this was the greatest idea I'd ever heard.” https://t.co/Cr5v4V7lqS — SI NHL (@SI_NHL) March 10, 2018
After each conference's top three teams had selected their first round challenger, the fourth-place team would then battle the remaining playoff contender yet to be selected. What's more is that, if adopted, the NHL could televise and promote the selection process — drawing a great deal of interest and discourse from fans and media in the process.
Rounds Two Through Four
Following the conclusion of an incredibly unpredictable opening series, rounds two through four would proceed based on each conference's original standings, much like they did from 1994-2013. So, if the first and eighth-placed teams within the Eastern Conference both ascended to the second round, the two combatants would battle one another given their regular season standings.
The Bevy of Benefits
While these potential changes to the NHL's existing playoff format would be wide-ranging, so too would the benefits derived as a result.
Firstly, and most importantly, implementing this system would once again reward the regular season's top teams, who would benefit from the ability to select their opening round opponent. Although this privilege may seem insignificant, it would provide select organizations with the ability to avoid a hot opponent or one which a team had struggled mightily against in recent history.
Further, instilling this format would be downright entertaining.
Although a Stanley Cup-bound team would still have to defeat the toughest of competition en route to a championship, creating unpredictability in the opening round would allow for never before seen matchups to occur and, potentially, new rivalries to materialize in the process.
A Quick Case Study
The 2017 Stanley Cup Playoffs stand as an excellent case study with regards to these potential playoff formatting changes.
Come to the end of the 2016-17 season, the Chicago Blackhawks led the Western Conference with 109 points — a standing which facilitated a first-round clash with the Nashville Predators. Having won 14 of their previous 20 games against the Predators, a Blackhawks' series win appeared to be well in hand.
However, the Predators entered the postseason ablaze, having won six of their previous ten games while outscoring their opposition heavily in the process. So, although Chicago had enjoyed a substantial amount of success against Nashville in recent history, the Blackhawks could very well have opted to play a team such as Calgary Flames — who they had handled with ease in the regular season.
Unfortunately for Chicago, the ferocious Predators dismantled their promising Cup run in just four games, outscoring the ‘Hawks 13-3 alongside a pair of shutout performances.
Potential Drawbacks?
To be rather blunt, there aren't any.
Although there would surely be a minor amount of disdain following the implementation of the changes outlined above, it would take little time for the format to gain traction with NHL's general managers and its players. In fact, general managers would likely welcome the alterations made to the formatting of the first round, as it would provide their team — provided they finish in the top-three of their conference — with the prime opportunity to embark upon a long postseason run.
Yes, there would be a slight learning curve, however, moving to the system outlined above would mark a return to a sensible conference-based format which rewards regular season success.
If the NHL were to adopt this format, it would provide the league's best teams with an equal opportunity to capture the Stanley Cup. Sure, any given team must defeat the NHL's most fierce competition in order to capture the Cup, however, eliminating elite teams in the opening round of the postseason does not bode well for the league, its disgruntled franchises, or their passionate yet perturbed fanbases.
Get ready to, hopefully, once again praise the creativity of the SPHL.
Horror films have had a box-office resurgence in the past few years. The success of movies like A Quiet Place and its more recent remake, show that audiences still love to be freaked out at the cinema. In Toledo we have access to home grown horror films like Shelved and the New Blood series. Now, a new horror film called Witchtown, instead of trying to scare you, wants to gross you out while you're having a good time.
Witchtown is the work of director/screenwriter Stephen Biggin and producer J.J. Kenczewicz (they also star in the film as Patches and The Professor). Witchtown tells the tale of those two attempting to resurrect an ancient evil force, with expectedly terrible results. The film, recently released, has been in the works for the past three years, and is now touring film festivals around the country, including the Motor City Nightmares International Film Festival in Novi on April 27th. Biggin took time to speak with the City Paper about their view of modern horror, their influences, and how they got the film made.
Witchtown From Scratch
Biggin is a Toledo School for the Arts graduate who has worked in industrial film, producing digital media for various companies. A few years ago, they and Kenczewicz, hanging out and discussing movies, had an idea to make their own. “We really didn't have ambitions for making a movie before,” Biggin said, “but that night we filmed ourselves goofing around.” From those test shots, they began writing a script for what would eventually become Witchtown.
Over the course of the next three years, Biggin and Kenczewicz pieced together their film. Biggin, the only one with previous film making experience (including most of the actors), knew enough about movie magic to make the shoots work. Shooting took place in and around Toledo, with a few scenes shot at Ft. Meigs in Perrysburg. “If one location didn't give us the look we wanted, we would get it by piecing shots together,” Biggin said.
Gross Absurdity
This patchwork style reflects the older feeling Biggin wanted to get out of the fim. Witchtown's biggest influences are the kind of films normally relegated to late-night cable channels, like Re-Animator or the works of David Cronenberg. Those films were at the height of “practical effects”, before computers rendered all the blood and guts. “Those movies weren't about being scary,” Biggin explained, “but being gross and shocking.” That was the goal with Witchtown; “We wanted our ambitious effects to really stand out, and we can't believe what we did with such a small budget.”
Witchtown will be screened during the 2018 Motor City Nightmares International Film Festival in Detroit on Friday, April 27.

Transfer market battle between the two
Hello and welcome to the Premier League transfer roundup for the day! Just over a month remains for the summer transfer window to open and the clubs are already pacing up deals to bring in players to make them stronger.
Summarising what lies up ahead, the usual suspects - Manchester clubs and Liverpool - are obviously there. The likes of Chelsea and Tottenham have also featured quite dominantly here, making this a top-five heavy roundup.
So, without further ado - let's begin!
#5 Jorginho agent speaks up
If we had to pick one player that has been linked with the most number of clubs over the course of the season, it has to Napoli's passing maestro Jorginho. The Italian, who holds the record of the most passes made in a game with 180 completed passes against Cagliari, has been linked with the likes of Manchester United, Manchester City, Liverpool, Tottenham and Chelsea.
Meanwhile, Jorginho's agent Joao Santos has spoken up about reports linking them with a move to Stamford Bridge. Santos claimed that the Blues haven't contacted them yet but conceded that they are an interesting prospect.
Speaking to Calcio Napoli, Santos said: “Chelsea have never had contact with me so I cannot talk, they've never called me.
“They're an important and interesting club – like Barcelona and Real Madrid – but they've never called me.
“I'll be in Italy this week. In the transfer market, things can mature in 15 hours or in 15 days.”
Keeping up the Jorginho topic, another one of their suitors, Manchester City, are being subject to Napoli playing hardball against them over the pass-master. The Partenopei are apparently stalling over naming an asking price over their prized asset.
According to Independent.ie, Jorginho has reportedly agreed on personal terms with the Citizens, but the Etihad outfit fear that they may have to go in a transfer war with Chelsea, who are expected to sign Jorginho's former boss Maurizio Sarri, over the Italian.
Speaking about Manchester City, the Citizens, the report adds, are looking for a wide forward and Riyad Mahrez, Leon Bailey and Kylian Mbappe are some of the names that Pep Guardiola seems to have in their mind.
The Latest: Real Madrid says it has no deal to sign Mbappe

MOSCOW (AP) — The Latest at the World Cup (all times local):
5:30 p.m.
Real Madrid is back in the thick of intrigue at the World Cup even with Spain having been eliminated.
The Champions League titleholder issued a statement Wednesday rejecting reports that it has reached an agreement to sign France forward Kylian Mbappe from Paris Saint-Germain. This comes two days after Madrid dismissed a report that it had offered to buy Neymar from PSG for a world-record transfer of 310 million euros ($360 million).
Madrid made waves at the start of the tournament when it hired Spain coach Julen Lopetegui to take over after the World Cup. Spain's federation summarily fired Lopetegui days before Spain's first match, saying the coach and club hadn't given it proper notice.

A Moscow court has fined a British fan for vandalizing a statue of a revered Russian soccer player outside a World Cup stadium.
The Tushinsky District Court handed a 3,000-ruble ($47) fine Wednesday to 20-year-old Rufus Hall for inscribing the statue of former Spartak Moscow player Fyodor Cherenkov with the word "England." Hall was detained by police just before England defeated Colombia on Tuesday.
The vandalism prompted an outpouring of criticism of English fans on Russian social networks, with users calling them poor guests. Hall apologized in a video posted online by Sport24.ru.
Cherenkov is not well known outside Russia but remains a hero to Spartak fans after winning three Soviet titles and one Russian title with the club. Thousands of fans attended their funeral in 2014.

Russian police have briefly detained several activists protesting political repressions outside a World Cup arena.
Police moved quickly to round up four teenagers outside the stadium where Sweden knocked out Switzerland on Tuesday. The four were released a few hours later.
Lika Petrovskaya, a 16-year-old who wore a bloodied white dress at the protest, said their goal was "to attract attention to the political repressions," including the imprisonment of Ukrainian filmmaker Oleg Sentsov. Another five activists were also detained Tuesday while they were distributing leaflets calling for Sentsov's release.
Sentsov, a vocal opponent of Russia's annexation of Crimea, was sentenced in 2015 to 20 years for conspiracy to commit terror acts. They denied the charges and has been on a hunger strike since mid-May.

After impressing at the World Cup, Iceland goalkeeper Hannes Halldorsson has been sold by Danish team FC Randers to Azerbaijan champion Qarabag.
Iceland exited the tournament at the group stage but Randers' sporting director Soeren Pedersen says the performance of the 34-year Icelander "hasn't gone unnoticed." Halldorsson's tournament was highlighted by saving a penalty kick from Lionel Messi in a 1-1 draw with Argentina.
Pedersen said Wednesday that the club got "a concrete bid from Qarabag, which we have accepted." Details of the deal were not released.
Halldorsson, who played 69 games for the team, said "it is time for me to try something else and embark on a new adventure."
In the blink of an eye, the NFL has lost one of its brightest young stars for the rest of the season.
Eagles coach Doug Pederson confirmed Monday that second-year quarterback Carson Wentz suffered a season-ending knee injury on Sunday, tearing their left ACL in Philadelphia's 43-35 win over the Los Angeles Rams.
Wentz injured the knee on a third-quarter scrambling dive into the end zone, a touchdown that was called back because of holding penalty on tackle Lane Johnson. The second-year starting quarterback was hit by a pair of Rams defenders on the run.
Pederson told reporters they believed the injury occurred right before the hit on Wentz.
"It appears watching the film again today it was actually before the contact so it could be a non-contact deal," Pederson said. "But that's just what it appears like on tape."
Wentz courageously played through the pain for another four snaps, ultimately finding Alshon Jeffery for a 2-yard touchdown on fourth-and-goal. After the drive, Wentz retreated to the locker room, giving way to backup Nick Foles, who led the team to a pair of field goal drives and the costly victory.
The loss of Wentz is dark and devastating for a team sitting atop the NFC. A viable MVP candidate, the big-bodied passer was enjoying a breakout campaign for the ages, throwing for a league-leading and franchise-record 33 touchdowns to just seven interceptions.
For all the ways Wentz scattered opponents with their powerful arm, dazzling mobility and aggressive feats of daring-do, the young quarterback came into their own this season as one of the game's premier pre-snap magicians.
Wentz has shown beyond-his-years ability to dissect defensive looks, play with pace, catch opponents off guard and pinpoint the ideal moment to strike downfield. These qualities can't be masked over by even the finest backup.
Foles is an experienced signal-caller -- 20-16 as an NFL starter -- and surrounded by a top-shelf roster, but the Eagles simply aren't the same team without their irreplaceable leader.
"We overcame a Pro Bowl left tackle [Jason Peters]. We overcame a middle linebacker [Jordan Hicks]," Pederson said. "We've overcome a core special teams player, our kicker this year. This is no different. Yeah, they are the quarterback of our football team and each one of these guys is tough to replace, but the reason we went out and got Nick Foles is for reasons like this, for situations like this. I'm excited for Nick obviously. I hate it for Carson Wentz; I hate it for the career and the season he's been having but at the same time it's been the next man up mentality and that's how we approach it this week."
With games left against the Giants, Raiders and Cowboys, Philadelphia is talented enough to run the table and command home-field advantage. Where they go from there, though, is tough to imagine with Wentz saddled in the distance.
During a season soiled by endless quarterback injuries and off-the-field drama, losing Wentz serves as a pre-Christmas sucker punch to the belly of any fan who adores fine quarterback play. They will be sorely missed.

LONDON (Reuters) -
FILE PHOTO: A copy of bitcoin standing on PC motherboard is seen in this illustration picture, October 26, 2017. REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/File Photo
Here are some facts that you might not know about the largest and best-known cryptocurrency.
HOW MANY ARE THERE?
Bitcoin's supply is limited to 21 million - a number that is expected to be reached around the year 2140. So far, around 16.7 million bitcoins have been released into the system, with 12.5 new ones released roughly every 10 minutes via a process called “mining”, in which a global network of computers competes to solve complex algorithms in reward for the new bitcoins.
ENERGY DRAIN
These mining computers require a vast amount of energy to run. As the price increases, more miners enter the market, driving up the energy consumption further. A recent estimate by tech news site Motherboard put the energy cost of a single bitcoin transaction at 215 kilowatt-hours, assuming that there are around 300,000 bitcoin transactions per day. That's almost enough energy as the average American household consumes in a whole week.
BITS OF BITCOIN
If you want to buy bitcoin, you do not need to buy a whole one. Bitcoin's smallest unit is a Satoshi, named after the elusive creator of the cryptocurrency, Satoshi Nakamoto. One Satoshi is one hundred-millionth of a bitcoin, making it worth around $0.0002 at current exchange rates.
BITCOIN BILLIONAIRES
Bitcoin has performed better than every central bank-issued currency in every year since 2011 except for 2014, when it performed worse than any traditional currency. So far in 2017, it is up more than 1,400 percent. If you had bought $1,000 of bitcoin at the start of 2013 and had never sold any of it, you would now be sitting on around $120 million. Many people consider bitcoin to be more of a speculative instrument than a currency, because of its volatility, high transaction fees, and the fact that relatively few merchants accept it.
EXCHANGE HEISTS
More than 980,000 bitcoins have been stolen from exchanges, either by hackers or insiders. That's a total of more than $15 billion at current exchange rates. Few have been recovered.
MYSTERY CREATOR
Despite many attempts to find the creator of bitcoin, and a number of claims, we still do not know who Satoshi Nakamoto is, or was. Australian computer scientist and entrepreneur Craig Wright convinced some prominent members of the bitcoin community that they were Nakamoto in May 2016, but they then refused to provide the evidence that most of the community said was necessary. It is not clear whether Satoshi Nakamoto, assumed to be a pseudonym, was a name used by a group of developers or by one individual. Nor is it clear that Nakamoto is still alive - the late computer scientist Hal Finney's name is sometimes put forward. Developer Nick Szabo has denied claims that they are Nakamoto, as has tech entrepreneur Elon Musk more recently.
INFLATED CHINESE TRADING
Until earlier this year, it was thought that Chinese exchanges accounted for around 90 percent of trading volume. But it has become clear that some exchanges inflated their volumes through so-called wash trades, repeatedly trading nominal amounts of bitcoin back and forth between accounts. Since the Chinese authorities imposed transaction fees, Chinese trading volumes have fallen sharply, and now represent less than 20 percent, according to data from website Bitcoinity.
“MARKET CAP”
The total value of all bitcoins released into the system so far has now reached as high as $283 billion. That makes its total value - sometimes dubbed its “market cap” - greater than that of Visa, and bigger than the market cap of BlackRock and Citigroup combined.
CRYPTO-RIVALS
Bitcoin is far from the only cryptocurrency. There are now well over 1,000 rivals, according to trade website Coinmarketcap.
“SHORTING”
It is already possible to short bitcoin on a number of retail platforms and exchanges, via contracts for difference (CFDs), leveraged-up margin trading or by borrowing bitcoin from exchanges without leverage. But a number of big financial institutions - including CME Group, CBOE and Nasdaq - have recently announced that they will offer bitcoin futures, which will open up the possibility of shorting the cryptocurrency to the mainstream professional investment universe.
LOST BITCOINS
Many fewer than the 16.7 bitcoins that have been mined are actually in circulation and accessible, because of forgotten passwords, accidental losses, hoarding, owners forgetting about coins or even dying. It is impossible to know for sure how many bitcoins have been permanently lost, because those that have are still in the system, in dormant addresses. But according to a December 2013 research paper by the University of San Diego and George Mason University, 64 percent of the 12 million bitcoins that had by then been mined had never been spent. Bitcoin developer Sergio Lerner estimates that almost 1 million unspent bitcoins belong to the cryptocurrency's mysterious creator.
RICH LIST
There are 5,638,155 bitcoins in the 1,000 biggest wallets - more than a third of all bitcoins in circulation. That makes the 1,000 biggest wallet-holders worth a collective $87 billion, at current rates.
HIGH FEES
The average fee paid to process bitcoin transactions has soared over the past year, outpacing even the staggering price increase of the cryptocurrency itself. Each bitcoin transaction now costs around $7.30 to process, up from around 30 cents at the start of the year, according to trade website BitInfoCharts.
FORKING OFF
If you owned bitcoin prior to Aug. 1, 2017, you also own Bitcoin Cash - a clone of the original. That is because on that date bitcoin underwent a so-called “fork”, in which the underlying software code was split into two. One unit of Bitcoin Cash is now worth more than $1,300. That adds roughly another 135 percent to the returns from a bitcoin investment at the start of the year.

A spat in a hotel at Merces took an ugly turn on Wednesday after four persons from the village attacked with sharp weapons a group of 47 tourists – men, women and children from Vasai, Mumbai.
The locals also damaged the bus carrying the tourists while it was leaving a guesthouse at Merces.
The fight left ten tourists injured and two of them, including the bus driver, sustained bone fractures.
Three of the accused were also injured as the tourists subsequently overpowered and beat them up.
All the injured were treated at the Goa Medical College and Hospital, Bambolim, and were discharged.
The Old Goa police said that three persons – Vishal Golatkar, Lawrence Dias and Suraj Shetye – have been arrested. However, the police are on the lookout for the fourth accused Sai Kundaikar.
Golatkar, Dias and Shetye were previously involved in criminal offences, the police said adding that all the accused are from Merces.
Detailing how the fight unfolded, the police said that one of the accused had a quarrel with four tourists at a hotel at Merces on Wednewday morning. They were at the hotel for breakfast. While having breakfast an elderly tourist's hand mistakenly touched the local man who was sitting on the table behind the tourists. The visitors apologised for the accidental touch, but the accused picked up an argument with the tourists.
At this juncture, it looked that the spat ended as the tourists as also the accused left the hotel.
The tourists joined their group which had checked out of a guesthouse which is located some metres away from the hotel.
The group got on their bus, and as the vehicle had been leaving the guesthouse area the four accused intercepted it and damaged its windscreen and side window glass by pelting stones, the police said.
Bus driver Shivaji Shelke was pulled out of the vehicle. The accused assaulted them – they hit the bus driver with a club, kicking and slapping him.
The cops, who had arrived at the spot, and the tourists nabbed one of the accused. Seeing this, the other three accused left the place and came back with a koita, a knife and sword and started assaulting bus occupants, the police said adding that the tourists managed to overpower the two accused while the third attacker managed to take to their heels.
North Goa SP Karthik Kashyap said that “at 10.30 am a call was received for robert police van, which reached the spot in nine minutes.”
Old Goa police personnel also reached the spot and brought the situation under control.
An FIR has been registered against the accused under various sections of the Indian Penal Code including Section 307 (attempt to murder).
A complaint in this regard was lodged by Lahu Ghodekar (58) from Vasai, Mumbai.
An anti-abortion bus bench ad in Lethbridge garnered attention across the country and now Advertising Standards Canada is responding to complaints about the ad.
READ MORE: Lethbridge transit bench with pro-life ad vandalized
In a letter sent to Global News by Lethbridge lawyer, Miranda Hlady, Advertising Standards Canada finds several faults with the ad campaign.
The standards council met last week to review complaints it received and manager of standards, Yamina Bennacer, issued the decision on Wednesday.
The image used was of a well-developed and mature-looking fetus, not in the early stages of development.
The wording said: “preborn babies feel pain.”
The council cited overwhelming scientific evidence refuting the statement that all fetuses feel pain, at all stages of development. It also said the combination of words and images in the ad were an “inaccurate and misleading representation, contrary to Clause 1 (a) of the code.”
In light of that, the council found the ad “demeaned and disparaged women who have had, or are considering, having an abortion by implying they are intentionally inflicting pain on their unborn fetuses.”
In April, the City of Lethbridge made the decision to remove anti-abortion ads from transit buses, bus shelters and bus benches after hearing complaints from the community.
The city said at the time that it had received more than 100 email complaints about the ads and numerous comments on social media.

President Trump promoted their upcoming visit to Wisconsin by sharing a Milwaukee Journal Sentinel report that their election and early presidency have spurred a surge in optimism among small businesses in the area.
Trump planned to tout their call to "buy American and hire American" on Tuesday during a stop at tool manufacturer Snap-on Inc.'s world headquarters in Kenosha, Wis.
Snap-on said in a statement that Trump's visit is "an encouraging development in highlighting the essential nature of American manufacturing to our nation's future."
Manufacturing jobs are one of the largest drivers of Wisconsin's economy, accounting for about 16% of the state's total workforce.
Trump's visit comes as the president faces an approval rating of just 41% in Wisconsin, a state they barely won in November.
Trump carried Wisconsin by nearly 23,000 votes — less than a percentage point — making them the first Republican to win the state since 1984. They campaigned on the promise of returning manufacturing jobs that have been lost in Wisconsin and similar Upper Midwest states.
Museums, relics, and cultural heritage are put on center stage in “The Nation's Greatest Treasures,” a high-powered Chinese factual TV series that mixes up variety, game show and discussion formats.
The first 10-part season of the show was broadcast on CCTV-3, the leading documentary channel belonging to state media giant China Central Television (CCTV) earlier this year. This is to be followed by live events that tour Greater China, and a second season that will broadcast at the end of 2018.
Production of the first series involved nine of China's top museums, and their curators who were each asked to nominate, and present three unique artifacts, for a total of 27 featured objects.
Audiences were encouraged to learn about China's history through the show's game-show-like format, as well as through extensive multimedia outreach. Online, the series claimed 1.7 billion discussion threads on Weibo and 800 million online viewers. It also encouraged the creation of user-generated content on the Bilibili video streaming platform.
The show received one of the highest profile launches this week at Hong Kong's FilMart. The presentation by CCTV and CCTV Documentary Media Company was attended by some 500 executives and visitors.
Star power was delivered by top Hong Kong actor Tony Leung Ka-fai (“The Lover,” “Election,) who is also a presenter of one episode. Dignitaries recruited to add heft to the event included: Elsie Leung, Hong Kong's former Secretary of Justice; Eve Tam, director of the Hong Kong Museum of Art; and industrialist Hui Wing Mau, chairperson of the Shimao Group.
Lionsgate's musical romance “La La Land” took home the top honor at the 21st edition of the Capri Hollywood International Film Festival, with the Italian fest naming the movie the best film of the year.
The award was announced Monday by festival founder and producer Pascal Vicedomini. Damien Chazelle's “La La Land,” starring Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone, won more prizes than any other film at this year's fest, with six trophies. Those include the best actor for Stone, the best ensemble cast, the best photography for Linus Sandgren, best score for Justin Hurwitz, and best song for “City of Stars.”
“Lion” and “Hacksaw Ridge” both followed closely behind with five awards each. The Weinstein Company's “Lion” won the Humanitarian Award, best supporting actor for Dev Patel, best supporting actor for Nicole Kidman, best adapted screenplay for Saroo Brierley and Luke Davies, and the Capri Peace Award for Sia for their song “Never Give Up.”
Mel Gibson's “Hacksaw Ridge” won the best drama, the best director, the best editor for John Gilbert, the best producer for Bill Mechanic, and best actor for Andrew Garfield, an award that they share with Michael Keaton for “The Founder.”
The comedy of the year prize went to Meryl Streep's “Florence Foster Jenkins,” which also won European director of the year for Stephen Frears. “Fire at Sea” received awards for best documentary and best European movie of 2016.
Best script went to Kenneth Lonergan's “Manchester by the Sea,” and Dante Ferretti and Francesca Lo Schiavo won best set design and decorations and best costumes for Martin Scorsese's “Silence.” “Toni Erdmann” was named the best foreign-language film, and Disney's “Moana” took the prize for best animated movie.
In TV, “Medici: Masters of Florence” won the fest's “TV Series 2016” honor.
“This was an extraordinary edition for the quality of the artists who attended and the variety of works presented,” said Vicedomini in a statement. “I'm positive that most of our award winners will go on to be honored at the Golden Globes and the Oscars. Best wishes to everyone and see you at the 22nd edition of Capri, Hollywood.”

Western Power Distribution said engineers worked through the night as they aimed to restore power to 10,000 home in the Midlands, South Wales and South West.
As a result of the snow and freezing conditions, Birmingham City Council has been forced to cancel all council-run school and related transport services on Monday, the authority said.
More than 200 schools will be closed in Gloucestershire, and more than 100 in Shropshire.
In Wales, 71 schools are closed in Flintshire, 11 in Wrexham and 49 in Denbighshire.
Pete Williams, the RAC's road safety spokesperson, said they are expecting 11,000 breakdowns on Monday, a figure which is 20% above the seasonal norm.
"I think the big thing is people are not going to leave enough time," they said.
"Journeys will take two to three times longer.
"It's going to be treacherous driving conditions."
They said low overnight temperatures could cause black ice and urged people to drive slowly, leaving plenty of space between them and the car in front.
This just in, and it's definitive (for now): People who drink alcohol in moderation — especially older people, women and non-Latino white people — are less likely to die of any cause than are teetotalers or people who consume heavy doses of alcohol either on occasion or in an average week.
In follow-up periods that hovered around eight years, moderate drinkers were no less likely than alcohol abstainers to die of cancer. But they were roughly a quarter less likely to die of heart disease or stroke than were people who never consumed alcohol.
Heavy drinkers fared slightly worse than moderate drinkers and never-drinkers in their likelihood of dying of any cause during the studies' follow-up periods. But it wasn't the risk of heart failure or heart attack that heavy drinkers drove up: it was cancer.
Heavy drinkers' odds of dying from cancer were roughly 45% higher than were the cancer-death odds of moderate drinkers.
In a meta-analysis — essentially an aggregation of studies reflecting the experience of 333,247 adults — researchers confirmed a long suspected (but much disputed) relationship between drinking and death: that, for most, consuming a little alcohol, even everyday, is better than drinking none. But throwing back too much is way worse than sipping just the right amount.
And what's the just-right amount of alcohol for health? Moderate drinkers are defined as men who consume, on average, no more than 14 servings of alcohol per week or women whose average consumption of alcohol is seven servings or fewer of alcohol per week. Here's what constitutes a serving (you might be surprised).
Binge drinking once a week or more (typically, drinking four or more servings of alcohol in two hours or less for women, or five or more for men) increased drinkers' odds of dying during the study periods by about 16%, largely by driving cancer rates up.
Alcohol consumption bedevils doctors, public health experts and patients alike, what with all the stigma, sanctimony, lying and uncertainty that surrounds this most common of vices. Patients lie about how much they drink. Unless they see clear signs of alcohol-induced damage in a patient, a physician are hard-pressed to guess. And claims and counter-claims abound about alcohol's impact on health.
The World Health Organization, citing alcohol's link to cancer, recommends against any consumption of alcohol at all. That may be reasonable, given that 3.3 million deaths, or 5.9% of global deaths in 2012, were attributed to alcohol consumption. But it may overlook the fact that, for those who can do so in moderation, alcohol consumption may positively influence health — and cardiovascular health in particular.
How alcohol influences health at different doses is also not well understood. Some research suggests that a modest intake of alcohol may reduce blood pressure, improve the function of blood vessels and — in the case of wine consumption at least — may introduce plant-based chemicals that scavenge toxins.
Aside from driving up risks of accidents and violence, excessive alcohol consumption may nudge cancer risk, especially for breast, colorectal and oral cancers, up by increasing inflammatory processes, changing hormonal balances, or suppressing immunity.
The newest research, published Monday in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology, does find some key differences by gender, ethnicity and age.
Heavy drinking drove up rates of all-cause mortality, and of cancer mortality, in men. But the same effect was not seen in women.
Non-Latino whites appeared to benefit from moderate alcohol consumption. But non-Latino blacks did not.
The protective effects of moderate alcohol consumption was more pronounced in people 60 and older than among people 40 to 59. And among younger adults — those 18 to 39 — moderate alcohol consumption didn't drive down death rates at all.

Fellow bearded Americana stalwarts Nick Offerman and Jeff Tweedy have collaborated on a number of projects, and now their paths will cross again in the upcoming Brett Haley-directed feature film Hearts Beat Loud. In it, Offerman plays a record store-owning single dad in Brooklyn who starts a band with their daughter, played by Kiersey Clemons.
Indie Easter eggs — like a stacked vinyl collection, mention of Spotify playlists, and KEXP YouTube clips of Jeff Tweedy and Mitski performances — are embedded throughout the movie. In the trailer, Offerman gets excited when they hear their father-daughter band, We're Not a Band, play in a coffee shop; The barista tells them it's on the “new indie mix” on Spotify. You also see a very brief shot of Tweedy standing in Offerman's Red Hook record store (note Lana Del Rey's Born To Die on the wall behind him) and Ted Danson in a Hawaiian shirt. Keegan DeWitt wrote all of the original songs on the film's soundtrack, which also includes Mitski's “Your Best American Girl,” and comes out on June 8th via Milan Records.

Dry Spell To Continue Until End Of May – Experts
By Serestino Tusingwire
Experts from Makerere university's geography department warn that the dry spell currently affecting the country could stretch until the end of the month of May.
The experts blame the current absence of rainfall on a dry climatic condition referred to as “La Nina”.
According the lecturer and coordinator of the metrology unit at Makerere University, Dr. Alex Nimusiima, the current weather pattern is not directly linked to the climate change.
“No change in the amount of rainfall that we have been receiving, but what is changing is the distribution of this rainfall within the seasons and this year's dry season could go up to May,” Nimusiima said.
On Monday this week, the minister for disaster preparedness Musa Echweru, said that the magnitude of this year's dry spell could equal an earlier drought in 1944 if the rains do not fall by the end of March.
An environmentalist and lecturer at Makerere University, Dr Max Kinobe says the change in climate is coming in because of a global system and less humility the world is currently facing.
They added that the current trends in the rainfall received can also be attributed to human activities such as deforestation.
The government warned on Tuesday that up to 1.5 million Ugandans face hunger as dry spell continues.
The 2017 Teen Choice Awards were up from last year in the Sunday overnight ratings, according to Nielsen data.
Airing from 8-10 p.m., this year's ceremony averaged a 0.6 rating in adults 18-49 and 1.9 million viewers. Last year's ceremony initially drew a 0.6 and 1.8 million viewers, but adjusted down to a 0.5 and 1.7 million in the final numbers. That means this year is currently up 20% in adults 18-49 and 12% in total viewers, though those numbers could change later today. The show was also up in the teen demographic, drawing a 1.5 in that demo compared to a 1.2 last year.
Elsewhere on broadcast, the start of CBS primetime programming was delayed due to the PGA Championship final round. Thus, CBS' numbers could be subject to greater adjustment. Currently, “Big Brother” (1.6, 5.4 million) is down in both measures compared to last Sunday. “Candy Crush” (0.6, 2.5 million) is currently up in both measures.
On ABC, “Steve Harvey's Funderdome” (0.8, 3.9 million) ticked up in the key demo, while “The $100,000 Pyramid” (0.7, 4.2 million) was even.
NBC aired only repeats.
CBS won the night with a 1.0 and 4.9 million total viewers. ABC was second with a 0.8 and 4.3 million. NBC and Fox tied for third in the demo with a 0.6 each. NBC was third in total viewers with 3.1 million. Fox was fourth with 2 million.
ISLAMABAD, Aug 14 (APP): The National Institute of Folk and Traditional
Heritage (Lok Virsa) celebrated the independence day of Pakistan in a befitting manner here at Heritage Museum, Shakarparian.
It was part of the ongoing activities chalked out by the Federal
Ministry of Information, Broadcasting and National Heritage regarding 70 years celebrations of Pakistan which started on August 1, 2017.
Special activities organized by Lok Virsa included an exhibition of
artisans-at-work, cake cutting ceremony of Pakistan's birth day and a special ceremony which featured a number of live colorful performances including famous milli naghmas, Kalam-e-Iqbal, folk songs, folk dances a special play on Pakistan. Milli Naghma `mein bhi Pakistan hun tu bhi Pakistan hai', Kalam-e-Iqbal `Khudi ka sere nehan..', folk songs `dane pe dana,, `sami meri war mein wari', `bi bi sherini' and mystic song `pat lal meri' presented on the occasion by children attired in traditional costumes.
Senator Rubina Khalid was the chief guest, who performed ribbon cutting,
cake cutting ceremony and graced special ceremony as chief guest. In their address, Senator Rubina Khalid highly commended the efforts of Lok Virsa in projecting and disseminating the cultural heritage of Pakistan in such a meaningful way.
Earlier, in their welcoming remarks, Dr. Fouzia Saeed, Executive Director,
Lok Virsa shed light on the activities chalked out by Lok Virsa marking 70 years celebrations of Pakistan. They said “The present focus of Lok Virsa is on youth, who are future of Pakistan. We want to inculcate them awareness about the indigenous folk culture. We have been successful in this initiative as thousands of youth and children are participating in our programs. Many of these have also performed on stage with folk artists and musicians”.
Later on traditional folk band “Khumariyaan” rocked at open air
theatre of Lok Virsa. The 4 band members showcase their magic with instruments like the guitar, rubab and the native Pushto instrument called the Zeer Baghali .
They commenced the show with their famous trackÂ Bela, the track almost
everyone has been listening to online and wondering how they have perfected the instrumental style.
Khumariyaan made people clap, head bang, swing, sing along and even
made some audience members get up and dance. They sounded phenomenal as their music sounded enthralling.
The band comprises Farhan Ali Bogra on the rabab, Sparlay Rawail on
lead guitars, Aamer Shafiq on rhythm guitars, Hammad Baig on the keyboard and backing vocals and Shiraz Khan on percussions. Bogra, however, has a deeper sentimental value attached to the rabab.
The story traces back to their childhood when their friend's father threw
away their son's rabab because they thought it was the instrument of”Uncivilized people”. When their friend protested for days, the father bought them a guitar because it's stereotyped as a “classy instrument”. This episode impacted Bogra's life and inspired them to pick up the rabab and promote it through their band's philosophy.
The Band well-received live performance on “Sheenai”, “Qataghani”,
“Bela”, “Tamasha” and “Sakal”. They ended the show on their most famous track, Tamasha and naturally the crowd went crazy; they danced and they hooted and they went into a trance. Basically, they did exactly what Khumariyaan aims to do; "entice musical “goose bumps” to people who listen their music.
The band members believe that, “If we manage to make the audience
forget their worries for a few minutes the point of forming Khumariyaan
would be fulfilled.” The band seems extremely gung-ho about their aim
which to a third person seems slightly incredible amidst the political and
social turmoil.
A large number of people from various walks of life attended the
ceremony and enjoyed thrilling performances presented by young artists.
OTTAWA—The Liberal government will introduce legislation later this year to erase past convictions for sexual activity with a same-sex partner, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced Wednesday as multi-coloured flags were raised on Parliament's west lawn.The legislation would add to reforms already in the works to atone for the damage caused to thousands of Canadians convicted of gross indecency for committing homosexual acts.Egale, a national organization that advocates for the rights of sexual minorities, handed the government a report last June that recommended those convictions be expunged, pardoned or somehow stricken from the records of those convicted.Before 1969, same-sex acts between consensual adults were considered unlawful.“Our government will be moving forward with a process for the expungement of criminal convictions for Canadians who were unjustly convicted of a crime simply for who they were and who they loved,” Trudeau said as dozens of people gathered for the announcement cheered.Article Continued BelowTrudeau also reaffirmed the commitment their government made last month to apologize for the wrongs of the past committed against gay, lesbian and transgender Canadians.Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness Minister Ralph Goodale(left), Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada Jody Wilson-Raybould, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Liberal MP Randy Boissonnault raise the pride and transgender flags on Parliament Hill on June 14. (Adrian Wyld / THE CANADIAN PRESS) The prime minister made the announcement on Parliament Hill after they and two of their cabinet colleagues, Justice Minister Jody Wilson-Raybould and Public Safety Minister Ralph Goodale, raised the Pride, transgender Pride, and Canada 150 Pride flags.Sporting rainbow-coloured socks for the occasion, Trudeau said their government is committed to acknowledging and addressing historical injustices experienced by Canadians for expressing their gender identity.
Reader George is kindly totting up the results of the WEIT 2018 World Cup Contest and scratching off the many who have lost. But some are still in the running! Here's their latest report to me:
The Second Quadrennial WEIT World Cup Contest is not doing well. It will probably suffer an untimely death. There were 95 entries. After the group stage, only 25 were still alive. After the round of 16, we are down to four. By comparison, in the Inaugural WEIT World Cup contest in 2014, there were 91 entries, 42 still alive after the group stage, 39 alive after the round of 16 and eight entries competing in the final (Argentina vs Germany). The big difference was that in 2014, the favorites won. The semifinals were Germany vs Brazil and Argentina vs Netherlands. In 2018, carnage. Germany getting knocked out took 42 entries. It has been downhill from there.
After the quarterfinals there will be zero, one or two entries still alive. The scores no longer matter – just the winner and loser.
If Brazil beat Belgium and –
1) Croatia beat Russia, contest is over
2) Russia beat Croatia – FB still alive. He/she picked Brazil 2 Russia 1.
If Belgium beat Brazil and –
1) Croatia beat Russia – deacjack still alive. He/she picked Belgium 3 Croatia 1
2) Russia beat Croatia – robkraft still alive. They picked Belgium 3 Russia 1.
If Belgium beat Brazil and England beat Sweden – Martin C. still alive. They picked Belgium 2 England 1.
The Trump administration said Friday it was lifting several key economic sanctions on Sudan because the African nation had shown improvement in fighting terrorism and rejecting ties with North Korea.
Some of the sanctions being removed were two decades old.
The decision also reflected better human rights conditions in the war-torn Darfur region of western Sudan and more access for humanitarian aid, a senior administration official said.
Other sanctions, including some also related to the Darfur conflict, will remain in place. But the decision effectively ends a 20-year U.S. economic embargo against Sudan.
It will improve that country's diplomatic ties with Washington and allow the unfreezing of Sudanese assets.
The Trump administration also recently removed Sudan from its controversial travel ban.
"We see this as an important milestone," said the U.S. official, who briefed reporters on condition of anonymity in keeping with State Department procedures.
But the official said Sudan still needs to make up ground to completely rejoin the world community. U.S. officials will closely monitor whether Sudan continues to prevent terrorists from transiting its territory, eases deliveries of humanitarian aid and cooperates in regional security efforts.
As a separate part of the deal, the Sudanese government pledged not to pursue the importation of any weapons from North Korea, the official said.
UNITED NATIONS, April 17 (APP): Noting that nearly half a million
people have fled Iraqi city of Mosul since the start of military operations to retake the city from ISIL/Da'esh terrorists, a senior United Nations humanitarian official in Iraq warned that the scale of the displacement has stretched relief efforts to their “operational limits”.
“Our worst case scenario when the fighting started was that up to one
a million civilians may flee Mosul. Already, more than 493,000 people have left, leaving almost everything behind,” Lise Grande, the Humanitarian Coordinator for Iraq, said in a statement issued by the UN Office for Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA).
“The sheer volume of civilians still fleeing Mosul city is staggering.
we are doing everything we can but this has been a long battle and the assault on the old city hasn't started,” they added.
According to estimates, as many as 500,000 people still remain in
ISIL/Daesh-controlled areas in western Mosul, including about 400,000 in the densely populated old city.
Humanitarian agencies are scaling up their response, preparing emergency
sites and camps to shelter the hundreds of thousands more who may flee in coming days and weeks, but they are under increasing strain.
Since the fighting began last October, some 1.9 million people have been
provided live-saving assistance, including food, water, shelter, emergency kits, medical support and psycho-social services, since fighting began last October.
“We're reaching families who have fled and families who have stayed
[but] Mosul has pushed us to our operational limits,” the Humanitarian Coordinator said.
The battle for western Mosul is very different from the one in the east
and so is the consequent impact on civilians. More trauma injures are reported and there are fears that food stocks and drinking water could run out.
“Civilians in Mosul face incredible, terrifying risks. They are being
shot at, there are artillery barrages, families are running out of supplies, medicines are scarce and water is cut-off,” the UN humanitarian official noted.
A UN press release also underscored that all parties to the conflict are
obliged, under International Humanitarian Law, to do everything possible to protect civilians, ensure they have the assistance they need, and limit damage to civilian infrastructure.
“Nothing is more important than protecting civilians” Ms. Grande said.
The tour takes in the markets and mosques of Old Delhi, the imperial city of New Delhi, the Taj Mahal and Jaipur's pink palaces. If you plan ahead, the same tour in May costs less than $1,000.

Recently I installed the GCompris educational software suite on a friend's Linux laptop. While researching information about the application, I found out about Rudra Nil Basu, a young programmer from India, who has blogged about their contributions to GCompris. Based on their work, they were selected to be a Google Summer of Code (GSoC) participant and will receive a stipend to continue working to improve GCompris.
I recently had the opportunity to ask Rudra some questions about how he's translating their passion for game development into making learning fun for young children and supporting open source software and source code sharing. Some questions and answers have been lightly edited for clarity.
Don Watkins: What is your history with software development and open source?
Rudra Nil Basu: I am a third-year computer science undergraduate from West Bengal, India. I was first introduced to programming about eight years ago and I've spent a large part of the last four years attending online and offline hackathons, making video games, contributing to open source projects, and hanging out with fellow programmers. All of these activities helped to increase my interest in computer science.
I came to know about open source during my first-year student year while attending an open source event at my college. The idea of making the original source code freely available and allowing anyone to modify it fascinated me. I decided to delve deeper into it and started learning Git. I started out by making a few of my personal projects available for contribution while contributing to other larger projects, which turned out to be a great learning experience for me.
While looking for more exciting projects to work on, I came across KDE's GCompris and decided to work on it. The overwhelming support from the community allowed me to get familiar with the codebase in no time. I have continued contributing to Gcompris and applied for Google Summer of Code for my project.
I am also the head of our college's open source community, where we create awareness about open source and encourage newcomers to take part in open source contributions.
GCompris challenges the game designer inside of me.
DW: How did your interest in game development attract you to GCompris?
RNB: My interest in game development played a huge role in getting interested in GCompris. While the technical aspects are an important part of developing a game, it is the design decisions that determine whether anyone plays it or not. GCompris is a project that focuses on making educational activities for children aged two to 10, and a lot of these activities are games. From a game designer's point of view, it is an interesting challenge, since a game has to be easy enough that children of the prescribed age can pick it up and find it easy to operate while maintaining the proper difficulty curve to make sure that they understand the concepts that are being taught. This challenge got me specifically interested in GCompris.
DW: What was it about the GCompris project that interested you?
RNB: Besides the fact that GCompris challenges the game designer inside of me, another reason why I am specifically interested in this project is that in India we have a lot of quality discussions about how the education system can be improved to make learning much more fun for children. One way is to provide practical demonstrations of what they are being taught, which unfortunately is not always feasible in the real world. That is where simulations come into play. A lot of the activities in GCompris are simulations of real-world problems that the users can relate to in real life.
GCompris has successfully created a great learning environment for children. I strongly believe in what GCompris stands for, and I am really excited to take it one step forward.
DW: What are your aspirations for the Google Summer of Code?
RNB: For Google Summer of Code, my plans are to complete three activities:
The first activity is to teach children how a submarine works, explaining its various components like the rudders, engines, and air tanks. The second activity is a family tree activity, which aims at teaching users how they are related to their other family members. The third activity provides a real-time simulation of electric circuits, aimed at explaining how the different components in a circuit work and how they can be used.
I've started these activities, and by the end of Google Summer of Code, I aim to complete them and add them in GCompris
Game development is not taken as seriously as a profession. I'd like to change that.
DW: How is GCompris licensed?
RNB: GCompris is licensed under the GPLv3 license.
DW: Do you have plans to write more educational games?
RNB: Sure. Currently, I am working on an ordering activity, which is aimed at teaching children about arranging numbers and letters in ascending and descending order. Post GSoC, I want to create a much more generic version of it, which will be aimed at teaching children to order items by their length, area, or weight, making sure we don't restrict the activity to just numbers and alphabets.
DW: What are your plans for the future?
RNB: That is quite a tough question that I have been thinking a lot about lately. I will be sticking with open source in the future for sure. I would also love to convert game development from a hobby to my profession. Here, game development is not taken as seriously compared to other professions, and I would like to change that.
DW: Anything else that you would like to share?
RNB: I would like to thank my mentors and my family members for the incredible support they have provided me; without them, none of these things would have been possible. It will be one of the most exciting summers in my experience, if not the most exciting summer, and I am looking forward to it.
RAWALPINDI, Dec 12 (APP):Two soldiers embraced ‘shahadat' when terrorists fired on an
army vehicle in North Waziristan Agency on Tuesday.
According to an Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) statement
issued here, the terrorists fired on army vehicle from surrounding mountains in
North Wazirstan Agency and resultantly an officer, 2nd Lieutenant Abdul Moeed
and Sepoy Basharat embraced shahadat.
The 21-year-old Lt Abdul Moeed, who recently had passed out from
Pakistan Military Academy was a resident of Burewala, Vehari. While Sepoy
Basharat, also 21-year-old having three years military service belonged to
Danyor village of Gilgit.
For a lot of people, making conscious choices in the name of health requires a lot of effort. It's hard to pass up takeout at the end of a long day and it's even harder to find the motivation to go to the gym. What does manage to keep most on the right track is seeing the results of their efforts in their changing physique.
But if the physical (and visual) rewards of your efforts aren't immediately evident, or they stall, that could be enough to set you off course. This is why getting in shape — whether that means losing weight and getting defined muscles or being able to climb a flight of stairs without huffing and puffing along the way — requires a combined effort.
READ MORE: 9 weight-loss tips that actually work
“Physiologically speaking, to lose weight, you have to burn more than you eat. It requires a 3,500-calorie deficit to lose a pound,” says Meg Sharp, director of personal training for the Cambridge Group of Clubs. “This can be done through either diet or exercise alone, but the human body is complicated. It's a bit of an oversimplification that you can choose to either burn your calories or reduce their intake.”
While they say it is possible to lose weight by choosing one of those health methods, the ideal is to combine them because they tend to work in tandem.
With diet alone, you'll see results in…
Assuming your first course of action is to address diet changes, Sharp says as long as you're creating a calorie deficit of roughly 500 (up to 1,500) calories per day, you can expect to see anywhere from a one- to three-pound weight-loss in the first week. And the more you continue to create that 3,500-calorie deficit, the more pounds you'll shed.
In fact, if your diet consists largely of refined and processed foods that are high in sodium, and you cut those out, you could even notice a difference within a day or two. That's because your body is de-bloating, Grant Weeditz, a Miami-based strength and conditioning specialist, said to U.S. News.
“It doesn't really matter how you do it, whether it's because you reduce your carbohydrate intake and increase your protein consumption [which will have a diuretic effect], or you stop drinking alcohol, as long as there's a deficit, you will see short-term weight loss,” Sharp says.
However, the key here is that the results will be short-lived. A UCLA study found that while dieters can expect to lose five to 10 per cent of their starting weight in the first six months of their diet plan, one-third to two-thirds of those dieters will regain more weight than they lost within four to five years.

“If you look at people who lose a lot of weight through diet alone and compare them to those who do it through diet and exercise, the latter group has better gains,” Sharp says. “That's because exercise increases lean tissue mass, preserves your metabolism, increases energy, reduces stress and decreases cortisol, which we know is key to weight loss.”
With exercise alone, you'll see results in…
This is hard to answer definitively, Sharp says, because it depends on so many factors. It is possible to lose weight by exercising and not changing your diet, although it won't be much.
“You would see an increase in muscle tone and you might see a small reduction in weight, but you can't exercise past a bad diet.”
Dick Thijssen, a professor of cardiovascular physiology and exercise at Liverpool John Moores University, estimates that three to four months of exercising without altering your diet would only result in an approximately two-pound weight loss.
Then there's the issue that many people overestimate how much they exercise and underestimate how many calories they're consuming. Combine that with the fact that exercise, especially cardio, tends to increase appetite, and the results could be the opposite of what you hoped for.
However, you may find that even if you're just exercising and not making any changes to your diet, what lands on your dinner plate may start to change.
“When someone exercises, their stress levels go down, they sleep better and have better self-esteem. They feel like an athlete and as a result want to eat like one, too,” Sharp says.
With diet, and a combination of cardio and resistance training, you'll see results in…
Much like the diet-only scenario, this combination will produce an immediate loss of one to three pounds in the first week, but that will escalate considerably by week four.
READ MORE: What's a better workout: Walking or running?
“At the four- to six-week mark, theoretically you could see anywhere from four to 18 pounds of fat loss,” Sharp says. “Resistance training and cardio combined will start to promote lean tissue building. You won't see huge changes in your body composition [meaning, you won't be ripped], but you will lose fat.”
By following this routine, they say you can expect to see an entire percentage of body fat lost per month. Significant weight loss and muscle gains will take approximately eight weeks to see, however, even though you're not seeing muscle definition, the benefits going on in your body and mind are considerable.
“Your clothes will fit better, your posture will be better and you'll walk taller,” Sharp says.
Which is better — diet and cardio or diet and resistance training?
In the realm of exercise, trainers will always err on the side of resistance training, because that's what will create the most change in your body through building lean muscle tissue.
“If you were only to do cardio and diet, you'd lose weight, but your metabolism would be compromised. Resistance training has a protein-sparing effect in that it doesn't like for protein to be metabolized for energy. Cardio doesn't make the same distinction — if you're running and you've burned up all your carbohydrate stores, your body will start leeching from your fat and protein stores,” Sharp explains.
That's not to say cardio isn't beneficial; it's great for your heart and lungs, but don't rely on it to give you a lean, defined physique.
“Cardio is about overall health, but a combination of diet and resistance training is what will make the most morphological change.”
Sunday provided several memorable NFL games, but few scenes like the one in Buffalo, with Bills and Colts players slugging their way through piles and piles of snow in a 13-7 overtime win for the home team.
A lake-effect system dumped up to eight inches of snow on the New Era Field on Sunday, with the storm never relenting.
"We kept saying it was like we were on a beach [in the sand]," receiver Deonte Thompson said, via ESPN's Mike Rodak. "The snow was so high so every time we stepped in it we would sink so it was tough to run a route.
"This is going to be something I tell my grandkids about. ... It was a crazy day today."
Epic photo evidence of Thompson's point from photographer Bill Wippert:
While both teams mostly eschewed the pass in the snowy conditions, Thompson's 34-yard haul on 3rd-and-9 with two minutes left in overtime set up the Bills' game-winning touchdown jaunt from LeSean McCoy.
"That was crazy man!" Kelvin Benjamin said of Thompson's catch. "That boy was blazing in the snow! Caught them with a jet ski, it was like they were on a jet ski man! I've never seen anybody run that fast in the snow, that was crazy!"
The swirling flurries induced a run-heavy game. The 97 combined rushing attempts between the two teams were the most in a game since Week 10, 1981 when the Chiefs and Bears tallied 100 attempts, per NFL Research.
It was not McCoy's first time playing in a snowstorm. The running back's career-high 217-yard rushing day came in 2013 with the Philadelphia Eagles in a whiteout win over the Detroit Lions. McCoy had 156 yards rushing Sunday, including the game-winner. The back said this storm was harder to deal with than the 2013 version.
"This game was a lot harder than the Philadelphia game," they said. "I think the biggest reason for that was that the snow never stopped and the wind never stopped. In the first half of the Philly game, it was crazy, but it stopped at halftime. We could run the ball a lot better. Where in this game, it continued to snow and snow and snow.
"I think this is probably the best [snow game], or the worst one."
JOHANNESBURG, Feb 2 (Reuters) - South Africa's Steinhoff said on Friday it would suspend dividend payouts until after the end of June as part of efforts to save money and convince creditors to waive some payments due in coming weeks.

Once an independent film powerhouse, the studio released critically acclaimed dramas — winning best picture Oscars for "The Artist" and "The King's Speech" — and commercial successes such as "Django Unchained." But the Weinsteins struggled financially as debts and flops piled up even before Harvey Weinstein was accused of sexual harassment and assault by dozens of women, leading to lawsuits against them and the company. Some of the claims are being investigated by police in Los Angeles, New York and London.
The head of the Divine Hand of God Prophetic Ministries International, Prophet Emmanuel Omale, has given series of revelations concerning the new year saying that God told them that former Vice President Atiku Abubakar, will “be forced out of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC)”, even as they added that the party's National Leader, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, “may be poisoned.” even as they called for fervent prayers.
Reading out 2017 prophecies and vision God showed them in a statement on Sunday in Abuja, Prophet Omale, also said that if “President Muhammadu Buhari chooses the Mandela option, (that is, not to contest again in 2019), a very powerful man will be anointed by them from North West to rule after him.”
They also revealed that if fervent prayers were not said, the Ekiti state governor Ayodele Fayose “may face impeachment.”
They said God told them that the proposed Mega Party will not come to reality in 2017 added that aside two People Democratic Party (PDP) governors “cross carpet to APC,” another “South-South strong man who rose out of the walls will join the ruling Pparty.”
On corruption, Prophet Omale said 2017 will witness the anti-corruption hammer landing three serving Ministersin President Buhari's cabinet.
On economy, the man of God said Dollar will move from last year prediction of $350 to $570, even predicted that “No oil in explorable quantity will be found in the North, NNPC should seek the Divine Hand of God to know where to find oil in the North.
“I see peace in Nigerdelta, but Federal Government should make peace with former President Jonathan and their family to sustain that peace.”
While calling on the country to “pray against a plane crash in early 2017”, they also warned that prayer should be said “against Boko Haram efforts to create mayhem in Abuja: residents of Gwagwalada should be vigilant.
“January 27th keep ringing bells in my head, let us pray for ourselves, for our country, we deserve political stability to enable economic prosperity. Let us pray! There will be no shedding of blood.
“Let us pray for the health of a former President to avert bereavement.
“I see fire outbreak in Lagos and Abuja markets.
“I see changes in INEC Leadership
“Taraba should pray to avert a very severe Ethno-religious crisis.
“A very important Emir should pray against bereavement.
“Nigeria should pray to avert deadly inter tribal clash in Lagos state
“A former Governor should pray against sudden death.
“I see massive oil spillage around Kogi that will lead to seven days fire.
“Three Banks will collapse.
“A Service Chief of one of the armed forces will be dropped.”
On international level, the prophet said they “foresee a massive typhoon in Thailand that may be worse than the last tsunami.
“The new Ghana President-elect should pray against liver and internal organ sickness after inauguration.
“Yahaya Jammeh will hand over to President-Elect Barrow.
“Robert Mugabe may not survive 2017.
“Jacob Zuma may still be in trouble, adding that “big tragedy will happen in China.”
“The English Queen should pray against life threatening health challenges.
On sports, they said a “famous Nigerian Athlete should pray against injury that may end their career.”
The Prophet however admonished that some of these danger can be averted if serious prayers are done.
BEREA, Ohio - Defensive end Myles Garrett, the draft's first overall pick, went to the ground in pain after a pass rush during team drills in the Cleveland Browns minicamp practice on Wednesday.
Coach Hue Jackson spoke to the media immediately after practice and could not assess if the injury was serious.

"That's part of the game," Jackson said. "Obviously I don't want to get any of our players nicked, hurt, any of that. But hopefully things will be fine. We don't want to lose any player, especially not one of our really good players.
"But hopefully things will be OK, and I think they will be. I don't know that for sure but we'll find out as I go inside."
Garrett was working with the backup defense during a two-minute drill. They got off the line quickly and beat the right tackle as they rushed quarterback Brock Osweiler. The play was whistled for a sack, but Garrett landed on their left foot after they had extended toward Osweiler.
They immediately went to the ground, kneeling with their head on the ground. Trainers checked them and they limped to the sidelines, where they again had their left foot checked without theirs shoe.
They did not leave the sidelines, something Jackson said they took as a "good sign." When the siren sounded for a lightning warning, Garrett limped into the fieldhouse with teammates.
"I'll know more once we get inside, but I think it's their foot," Jackson said. "So we'll see. I don't know how it happened. Those things happen. Hopefully everything's OK."
Garrett had missed some practice time in offseason work for an undisclosed issue that was not believed to be serious. Jackson would and could not say if the problem in minicamp was the same one that had been bothering him.
"Glad it's toward the end (of offseason work)," Jackson said. "He did some good things today and we'll see where we are."
Firefighters discovered a body outside the burning home at 50 Aino Beach Rd. on Tuesday morning.
The body has been sent to the Centre for Forensic Sciences in Toronto, where a post-mortem will be performed to determine the identity of the victim and cause of death.

Often when a player makes their NHL debut, it occurs in a normal regular season game, perhaps in an unfamiliar city.
Seldom does it happen on a team's opening night, when their name is announced during introductions and they skate out to center ice under a spotlight. Such was the case Thursday for three Kings: Alex Iafallo, Oscar Fantenberg and Kurtis MacDermid.
“The national anthem gave me some chills,” Iafallo said Friday, a day after the Kings' 2-0 victory over Philadelphia. “Very cool.”
Iafallo's parents, Tom and Barbara, flew to L.A. from Buffalo, N.Y., to watch their son in person. MacDermid is from Sauble Beach, Canada, three hours north of Toronto, and there wasn't enough time for their parents to make it out. But it was special for all three to reach that moment in their careers simultaneously.
“It was great experience, especially doing it together,” Iafallo said. “We had all training camp together. It was fun to play the home opener with such an amazing team and amazing players. It can't get any better than that.”
Kings coach John Stevens paused and thought for a moment when asked if he'd ever had three players make their NHL debut in the same game.
“I've had lots of young players in the lineup,” Stevens said. “Whether they all made their debut together, I'm not sure.”
Stevens graded them differently given their various roles. Iafallo displayed high-end skill as the left wing on the top line. The 6-foot-5, 208-pound MacDermid is an intimidating presence in the mold of former Kings defenseman Matt Greene, and they were paired with the dynamic and more offensive-driven Fantenberg.
Fantenberg is older than Iafallo and MacDermid — they turn 26 on Saturday when the Kings play the San Jose Sharks — and they have extended European experience. They said it helped to take part in development camps over the summer to adjust to the NHL game.
Fantenberg played more than 17 minutes and was a plus-1 against the Flyers with MacDermid as their partner.
“He's a big guy and they play a simple [game],” Fantenberg said. “You feel pretty safe out there. They talk a lot and it's easy to play with him.”
MacDermid turned in some big hits and knocked down the Flyers' Taylor Leier behind the net in the second period. They were inserted into the lineup after Alec Martinez got injured before the opener.
“It's something I've dreamt of since I was a kid,” MacDermid said.
Third line iced
The line of Adrian Kempe, Jonny Brodzinski and Michael Cammalleri was all but benched in the third period. Kempe and Brodzinski took two shifts each and Cammalleri four.
Stevens said their ice time wasn't curbed because of the special teams situations.
“It will be earned throughout the hockey game,” Stevens said. “I thought there were times in our zone we got in trouble. That line specifically had some trouble managing the puck in the neutral zone.”

As if getting venture funding themselves isn't exciting enough for open source-oriented startups, seeing an open source-focused company like Deis get snapped up by Microsoft must be a thrill as well.
While it would be more thrilling, perhaps, if Microsoft disclosed how much it paid, I'm sure those in the startup world and their backers have ways of finding out that information. Not that the acquisition path is necessarily the exit route that all of these startups envision for themselves, but such money can obviously talk.
What I can tell you is that 10 open source-oriented companies that have received funding over the past year or so, and that I've documented in Network World's interactive startup funding timeline over 2016 and 2017, have done so to the tune of a combined $100M-plus.
Here's a brief look at 5 of those companies, and I'll be back in the next couple of weeks with a look at 5 more. Note that this list only contains companies that have announced funding over the past year or so, and isn't intended to be an all-inclusive compilation.

Akeneo
Founded: 2013
Headquarters: Nantes, France (with operations in Germany and the U.S.)
Funding: More than $15M, including $13M in March from Partech Ventures and Alven Capital.
Focus: The company name comes from the word “'akene', the dry fruit produced by the dandelion: a light and elegant way for a flower to propagate its seeds. An inspiration for how we built our PIM.” Which of course leads to the question, what's a PIM? PIM stands for Product Information Management, and Akeneo says PIMs have been described as CRM systems for products in that they more easily allow technical and marketing product data to be shared across sales, manufacturing and other channels. Akeneo's founding team has a background in e-commerce, not surprisingly. Akeneo's PIM source code is released under an open source license, so you can get the open source edition of Akeneo's software for free, or upgrade to a premium version, as Adidas, Samsung and others have. Akeneo's product is available on-premises for enterprises or via a cloud service.
Akeneo Akeneo founders Benoit Jacquemont (CTO), Frederic de Gombert (CEO) & Nicolas Dupont (head of engineering)
Attic Labs
Founded: 2015
Headquarters: San Francisco
Funding: $8.1M in Series A funding in August, led by Greylock Partners
Focus: Noms, a decentralized open source database for storing, moving and collaborating on large-scale structured data. It's initially supported on Mac OS X and Linux, and according to the Noms creators, it has much in common with projects like Git. Attic Labs says Noms is set apart from other databases in that it can be used to track the history of databases and the data in them. The team at Attic Labs, including CEO and co-founder Aaron Boodman, previously helped to build things like Google Chrome, Chrome OS and Google Reader (R.I.P.) .
FOSSA
Founded: 2014
Headquarters: San Francisco
Funding: $2.2 million in seed funding, led by Bain Capital Ventures, in February
Focus: Open source management and license compliance tool that tracks some 1 million code bases. Such a tool is necessary, the company says, because so many applications these days comprise oodles of shared code featuring unique licenses. CEO and founder Kevin Wang wrote in February that “As software developers, we're entering a world where we no longer write nor own the majority of the code that we ship in our products. Instead, the average modern app relies on code shared by thousands of third-party developers.” The free public beta of FOSSA is available, as is an enterprise edition that costs $500 per repository per month. SolarCity and SmartThings are among FOSSA's early customers. The company's backers include the founders of Skype, Youtube, Salesforce and Tinder.
Heptio
Founded: 2014
Headquarters: Seattle
Funding: $8.5M in Series A funding, led by Accel with participation from Madrona Venture Group
Heptio Heptio founders — and Kubernetes creators — Joe Beda and Craig McLuckie
Focus: This company is the brainchild of Craig McLuckie and Joe Beda, two founders of the Kubernetes open source containerized apps management/orchestration system developed at Google in 2014 and that now lives within the Linux Foundation's Cloud Native Computing Foundation. Heptio's aim is bringing Kubernetes to the enterprise to help organizations transition to cloud native computing. One way that the outfit will make money is by offering courses, such as Introduction to Kubernetes and Containers, to the public and to private organizations. Early on, Heptio will look to help organizations exploit the power of Kubernetes while running apps on-premises or in the public cloud. As for the company name, it has its origins in the number 7 and Star Trek: Voyager, and is super convoluted.
SnapRoute
Founded: 2015
Headquarters: Palo Alto
Funding: $25M in Series A funding, led by Norwest Venture Partners
SnapRoute SnapRoute CEO Jason Forrester: They oversaw the design and operation of Apple's global data center networks.
Focus: This has to be one of the more interesting startup founding teams around from an enterprise networking perspective: CEO Jason Forrester, Founding Engineer Adam Casella and Director of Customer Experience Glenn Sullivan all played big roles in running Apple's hyperscale data centers and networking infrastructure. Their idea for SnapRoute, and its open Flexswitch network operating system, was inspired by the closed networking systems they dealt with as network operators at Apple (perhaps not unlike the frustration Apple users have with Apple's closed systems?). By providing open and modular software completely visible to customers who run it on white box switches and routers, SnapRoute figures its technology will become stronger and more reliable as it goes along. What's more, SnapRoute is contributing to the broader opening networking movement, including through the OpenSwitch project.
(The Real Agenda News) The civilian casualties of the latest US alleged operation against Al Qaeda in Yemen appear to have led the Yemeni government to suspend US government missions on its territory, the New York Times reports.
The Yemeni authorities have yet to officially comment on the measure, but the bombing, the first of its kind authorized by President Donald Trump, caused about thirty deaths, half of them women and children, as well as the death of a US commando's life and the loss of a helicopter.
“I can not confirm or deny the information because I do not have data. It is a decision that corresponds to the president,” said an adviser to the Yemeni Foreign Minister Abdulmalik al Mekhlafi.
US Central Command of Operations in the Middle East (CENTCOM), which coordinates the missions in Yemen, did not respond to a request for comment on the matter.
The New York Times cites unidentified “US officials” claiming that the suspension has occurred following the fiasco of the operation in al-Baydah, one of Al Qaeda's fiefdoms, and which took place on the last Sunday of January.
It is not clear if the Yemeni decision responds to the inclusion of the country in the list of nations whose citizens were banned by president Trump's Administration from entering the United States, or if the ban itself spurred the Yemenis from issuing the prohibition against US operations.
What is clear is that the bombing, much criticized by the experts, angered the Yemeni rulers, already pressured by the stagnation of the conflict with the Huthi rebels and its allies who accuse them of being puppets of Saudi Arabia.
Al Mekhlafi, the head of Foreign Affairs, described the deaths as “extrajudicial killings” on their Twitter account.
“The Yemeni government is a key partner in the fight against terrorism, but such cooperation cannot be carried out at the expense of Yemeni citizens and national sovereignty,” said Ahmed Awad Bin Mubarak, the Yemeni ambassador to Washington, interviewed on the Arab channel, Al Jazeera.
Bin Mubarak, who is a person close to President Abd Rabbo Mansur Hadi, also said that they had mentioned the matter to the US ambassador to Yemen during a rendezvous in Riyadh, where the bulk of the internationally recognized Yemeni government is located.
The Pentagon conceded last Thursday that several civilians had been killed in the Al Baydah attack and that it was investigating.
Explanations by some spokespersons that the dead women were fighters raised skepticism as images of the bodies of bloodied children on social networks agitated the discomfort of Yemenis.
According to New York Times sources, the decision “does not affect attacks with military drones,” as it did in 2014 when the Sanaan government canceled drone flights because of the numerous civilian casualties they caused.
At the time, as attention focused on other problems, the program resumed even more intensively as Yemen fell deeper into chaos and whose result was the growth of Al Qaeda and other jihadist groups.
Significantly, the measure does not seem to affect the handful of US military advisers who provide intelligence support to the Yemenis and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) forces, the only ones in the Saudi-led coalition with a significant presence on the ground.
Yemen, a country fractured in a thousand pieces by a long overlapping of conflicts, was from the beginning a perfect refuge for the members of Al Qaeda, but its importance grew after 2001 when the US began to bomb Afghanistan, in retaliation for the 9/11 attacks.
The growth and development of this group, which years later merged with the Saudi Arabian branch to form Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQPA), was undoubtedly helped by the duplicity of its president, Ali Abdalá Saleh, who used the threat to get aid from Washington.
Now the intervention of Saudi Arabia, to stop the coup of Huthi rebels allied with Saleh, has given air to Al Qaeda.
Jennifer Lopez and Drake rang in 2017 at their Las Vegas show on Saturday.
The Jenny From the Block star supported Drake at their New Year's Eve show at the Hakkasan nightclub after they both enjoyed dinner with a large group of friends, according to Usmagazine.com, further fuelling romance reports.
“Jennifer watched and had the best time at Drake's show,” a source said, while another added the 47-year-old was wearing a “sexy ivory-coloured cutout dress for the club” after switching out of the plunging red velvet dress they wore at dinner, held at the Hakkasan restaurant.
Cherney Amhara, a reporter from FOX5 Las Vegas shared a video of Lopez dancing to Drake's set and tweeted, “More from #Drake's performance at #Hakkasan, that lady dancing at Drake's table looks familiar... #Jennyfromtheblock.”
Eagled-eyed fans have also claimed the singer was wearing Drake's long gold necklace, which they have worn on many occasions, in a photo taken at dinner.
The singer was scheduled to host a New Year's Eve show at nightclub E11EVEN Miami in Florida, but they pulled out before Christmas citing “personal and family time” and was replaced by rapper Nicki Minaj.
Lopez, who split from dancer beau Casper Smart in August, fuelled romance rumours with the One Dance rapper when they shared a picture of themselves cuddling up on a couch with Drake on Instagram last week. A day later they reportedly shared a kiss while being crowned king and queen of a “prom” party in Los Angeles.
They were first linked at the start of December after the 30-year-old attended two of Lopez's Las Vegas concerts back-to-back and hosted an intimate party they attended.
Preparedness in the face of major disease outbreaks can save thousands of lives: Rapid deployment of effective diagnostics, treatments, and vaccines may even stop the disease from potentially exploding into a pandemic. A new article by Anthony S. Fauci, M.D., director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), part of the National Institutes of Health, and colleagues examines the multifaceted nature of effective preparedness and the particular role that biomedical research plays. Specifically, the article examines three approaches to pandemic preparedness: pathogen-specific work, platform-based technologies, and prototype-pathogen efforts. Using vaccine development as an example, the authors conclude that a combination of all three approaches will lead to the best preparedness for future pandemics. The article appears online today in The Journal of the American Medical Association.
Pathogen-specific research prioritizes diseases known to be dangerous, such as Ebola. Countermeasures to prevent and fight the disease are developed ahead of time and can be rapidly deployed if those diseases emerge. However, this approach relies on the ability to correctly identify future threats and cannot prepare for unexpected outbreaks, such as HIV, SARS, or Zika.
With platform-based approaches, researchers focus on developing customizable techniques, such as those involving nanoparticles or viral vectors. In the event of a pandemic, genetic material can be incorporated into the platform to protect recipients against a specific disease.
The “prototype pathogen” approach can shorten the time needed to create vaccines using platform-based methods. This approach involves studying the characteristics of categories or families of pathogens, such as the family of viruses that contains dengue, West Nile and Zika viruses, and developing vaccines for the category ahead of time. When a disease from a specific category causes an outbreak, these vaccines can be customized if necessary to the specific pathogen within that family, and researchers have a greater chance of quickly deploying an effective vaccine, the authors write.
Despite their adaptability, platform-based and prototype-pathogen approaches do not necessarily yield fully-developed vaccines, treatments or diagnostics, which can lead to a slower response than if pathogen-specific countermeasures had been developed. The best way forward is a combination of all three approaches, the authors write. By investing in research to develop specific countermeasures for known threats and utilizing platform-based and prototype-pathogen approaches to allow for adaptation when unexpected outbreaks arise, global public health organizations can best prepare to combat future disease outbreaks.

Following a successful raise in 2016, Black Medicine is going for a second round of funding via equity-based crowdsourcing site CircleUp, a platform that netted the cold brew coffee maker $1 million last year.
According to president Chris Cooper, Black Medicine is currently seeking $800,000 to cover general operating costs, including marketing and efforts to improve and refine production line automation. Two weeks in, the fundraising campaign has already raised about 40 percent of its goal. The previous round, Cooper said, took about five weeks to close.
The decision to crowdsource the funds, instead of more traditional seed round techniques, helped connect Black Medicine with investors in the food and beverage industry who the startup may not have been able to get in contact with otherwise, Cooper said. The crowdsourcing platform also allows Black Medicine to readily do several smaller funding rounds, rather than attempting to raise a large amount of money all at once.
“Since I come from a tech background, I don't have the contacts in this industry,” Cooper said. “If I had to go out and do it traditionally, meeting people one by one, I wouldn't reach very many people and it would take a long time.”
The funding round comes after the company completed a packaging transition from bottles to cans that Cooper admitted was “harder and took longer” than planned. Production issues caused hiccups in the rollout of the new cans and confusion over the packaging forced Black Medicine to reach out to retailers directly to discuss the change.
“It was tough,” Cooper said. “We ran into some obstacles that we hadn't expected. We didn't realize how tough it is to get the buyers in the stores to realize there were new SKUs … We ended up having to talk to buyers at hundreds of individual stores to make sure they were all up to speed.”
Despite the difficulties, the launch went out on time and thanks to savings in materials costs, Black Medicine has been able to drop the shelf price of its RTD coffee line from $3.99 per unit to $2.99. With the price drop sales have increased and the company is now reporting an increase in overall revenues.
With cans on shelves, Black Medicine has now released a line of cold brew concentrates, sold in eight-serving, 10 oz. bottles for $8.99 in regular unsweetened and mocha flavors. Although they come in smaller packages than most concentrates on the market, Cooper said Black Medicine's custom hot brewing process makes the product much stronger than other brands. Customers are advised to mix the concentrate at a 5:1 water-to-coffee ratio, whereas most other concentrates are at a 1:1 ratio.
“The result in our case is a drink that is much richer,” Cooper said.
While Cooper believes in the quality of their product, they did express concern that customers may look at bigger bottles of concentrate at the same price point and incorrectly assume they're getting more servings for their dollar. To educate consumers, Black Medicine intends to up its in-store sampling presence.
“The plan is to continue along with what's been successful for us with our ready-to-drink, which is getting it in front of customers, getting them to try it, and explaining what the difference is,” they said. “It means mobile sampling, it means in-store demos to educate people but especially getting it in front of them.”
The concentrates are currently rolling out to stores in the Oakland, California area, where Black Medicine is located, and will go on sale at West Coast Whole Foods, Safeways, and other chain stores next month.
Amy Schumer has found their next film.
Wonderland Sound & Vision and Voltage Pictures have tapped Schumer to star in their upcoming comedy, “I Feel Pretty,” from a script written and to be directed by Abby Kohn and Marc Silverstein.
The movie, set to shoot this summer on the East Coast, marks Kohn and Silverstein's directorial debuts. The plot is being kept under wraps.
Schumer recently dropped out of the “Barbie” live-action movie due to scheduling conflicts.
The comedian, who is also a producer on “I Feel Pretty,” was last seen in the box office hit “Trainwreck” and will next star opposite Goldie Hawn in the Jonathan Levine comedy “Snatched.” The Fox film hits theaters on May 12. Schumer will also appear alongside Miles Teller in the Universal drama “Thank You for Your Service” from filmmaker Jason Hall.
Wonderland's McG and Mary Viola will produce along with Voltage's Alissa Phillips, Dominic Rustam, and Nicolas Chartier. Kevin Kane, who collaborates frequently with Schumer, is on board as a co-producer.
Voltage snagged the project during a heated bidding war then quickly signed Schumer. Alissa Phillips brought the project in for Voltage. Jonathan Deckter will also exec produce the pic for Voltage.
Voltage Pictures will finance the film and handle international distribution rights at the upcoming Cannes Film Festival.
Schumer is repped by UTA, Carrie Byalick at B Company and Schreck Rose Dapello Adams Berlin & Dunham..
NEW YORK — Dick Clark Productions is hitting back against Mariah Carey's claim it sabotaged their live performance on its “New Year's Rockin' Eve” special.
Carey's disaster during the annual New Year's Eve special in Times Square made international headlines: The superstar vocally stumbled through their short set, failing to sing for most of it despite a pre-recorded track of their songs playing in the background.
Carey was visibly upset during the performance and afterward tweeted “(expletive) happens.” Them representative Nicole Perna blamed technical difficulties, and in an interview with Billboard they said Dick Clark Productions hampered Carey's performance.
Shit happens 😩 Have a happy and healthy new year everybody!🎉 Here's to making more headlines in 2017 😂 pic.twitter.com/0Td8se57jr — Mariah Carey (@MariahCarey) January 1, 2017
“She was not winging this moment and took it very seriously,” Perna told Billboard. “A shame that production set them up to fail.”
Perna said Carey's earpiece wasn't working and they flagged the issue to the production team but was told it would be OK when they got on stage.
“However, that was not the case, and they were again told that their earpiece was not working,” Perna said. “Instead of endeavouring to fix the issue so that Mariah could perform, they went live.”
In a statement released on Sunday, the production company called such claims “absurd.”
“As the premier producer of live television events for nearly 50 years, we pride ourselves on our reputation and long-standing relationships with artists,” it said. “To suggest that dcp (Dick Clark Productions), as producer of music shows including the American Music Awards, Billboard Music Awards, New Year's Rockin' Eve and Academy of Country Music Awards, would ever intentionally compromise the success of any artist is defamatory, outrageous and frankly absurd.”
It said that in “very rare instances” there are technical errors that can occur with live television. It said an initial investigation, however, indicated it had no involvement in the challenges associated with Carey's performance.
“We want to be clear that we have the utmost respect for Ms. Carey as an artist and acknowledge their tremendous accomplishments in the industry,” it said.
A person familiar with the production of the show who asked for anonymity to speak publicly about the incident said all of the other performers, including Gloria Estefan, rehearsed onsite for their performances and Carey was there but had a stand-in for their rehearsal, atypical for the show's performers. The person said all of the monitors were working and no technical problems were found.
Ironically, Carey was Dick Clark Productions' first live performer for the broadcast in 2005, when it went off without any such problems.
ISLAMABAD, July 4 (APP):Prime Minister justice (retd) Nasir-ul-Mulk Wednesday said international community must play its role for realization of right to self-determination to Kashmiri people in the Indian occupied Kashmir (IoK) as promised to them through the UNSC relevant resolutions.
They were talking to Azad Jammu and Kashmir Prime Minister Raja Farooq Haider Khan who called on them at PM Office, a press release said.
Nasir-ul-Mulk condemned the reign of state sponsored terrorism as well as grave human rights violations perpetrated by the Indian occupation forces on the unarmed civilians of IoK.
The prime minister reaffirmed moral, political and diplomatic support of the people and the government of Pakistan to the people of IoK in their legitimate struggle for their right to self-determination.
During the meeting, the overall situation in Azad Jammu and Kashmir in general and the plight of the innocent people of IoK in particular came under discussion.
Jay Cutler and the Miami Dolphins (6-7) put together their best performance of the season, stuffing the New England Patriots (10-3) in South Beach yet again, 27-20, on Monday Night Football in Week 14. Here's what we learned:
1. The New England Patriots will have to wait another week to assume their rightful place on the AFC East throne. Monday evening was Miami's night. From start to finish, the Dolphins were the better team, the faster team, the team that capitalized on its opportunities and played better situational football. Down 17 points at one point in the second half, their worst deficit all season, New England mounted a deliberate comeback, but could only cut Miami's lead to seven before the clock ran out.
Speaking of clocks, Jay Cutler (263 yards, three TDs) turned back theirs to the Denver days, relying on their elusiveness and arm strength to tear apart New England's defense, which has steadily improved since the season's first quarter. With Damien Williams out, Miami relied for the second week in a row on a century-mark outing from Kenyan Drake. The Alabama product burned the Patriots' injury-riddled defensive line -- missing Trey Flowers and Alan Branch -- inside and outside, rolling for 193 total yards.
2. Miami beat up Brady every chance it got on Monday night. The future Hall of Famer was hit six times and sacked twice by Miami's front seven. As a result, the Patriots struggled mightily on third down, converting none of their 11 attempts. Brady's throws were noticeably errant -- they underthrew Brandin Cooks on both of their interceptions -- and constant pressure brought by Ndamukong Suh, Jordan Phillips and a blitzing T.J. McDonald against a Pats O-line missing its starting right tackle, Marcus Cannon, made life more difficult as the game wore on. In becoming the third team to top New England this season, the Dolphins successfully executed a tried and true formula: Hit Brady early, and hit them often.
3. Give it up for second-year corner Xavien Howard, who shut down Patriots game wrecker Brandin Cooks and picked off Brady twice. Howard has four interceptions in their last two games after snagging zero picks in their first 18. Howard led all players with four passes defensed. Alongside McDonald, Reshad Jones and Alterraun Verner (two passes defensed), Howard makes up an underrated Miami secondary.
Around the NFL will have more on this game shortly.
AUGUST 14, 2017 — The Interfax-Ukraine news agency reports that, as part of a revival of Ukrainian river transportation, the Pallada Kherson state-owned plant has initiated the design of an environmentally friendly tow boat with a ferroconcrete hull.
With a carrying capacity of 1,000 tonnes, the tow boat will be able to transport mineral and construction freight, agricultural products, heavy and other freight.
Pallada Kherson is currently the world's only shipyard to specializes in building next generation composite floating dry docks for maintenance of civil and naval ships. The warranty period for this equipment is 50 years, reports Interfax-Ukraine.
It has been using shipbuilding concrete based on sulfate-resistant portland cement for construction of floating docks for many years
"When ferroconcrete facilities are built and used no expensive protective paint-and-lacquer coating is used, and the Pallada-made tow boats will be environment friendly," the plant told the news agency.
An embattled state senator could face a recall election as soon as this fall after an appeals court on Monday delayed enforcement of a law crafted by Democrats to slow down the process.
The new law was written with hopes of delaying a recall election for state Sen. Josh Newman (D-Fullerton) until next year, but their opponents have wanted a special election this year. They targeted the first-year student lawmaker after their vote in favor of gas and vehicle taxes as part of a $52-billion transportation plan.
The new law, written by legislative Democrats and signed by Gov. Jerry Brown, added significant new steps to certifying a recall election. Newman's opponents challenged the law in court last month, arguing that there is no legal justification for the new law to apply retroactively to pending recall efforts like the one against the senator.
Justice Vance W. Raye's order issued Monday requires state elections officials to set aside the new law until the case is resolved in court. That delay would probably mean a recall election could be held in Newman's Southern California district in November.
"We're very pleased," said Jon Coupal, president of the Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Assn., which is supporting the recall and filed the lawsuit against the new rules. "This was an inappropriate action by the Legislature."
Recall backers have submitted more than 96,000 voter signatures to call a special election -- far more than the 63,593 valid signatures needed.
A spokesperson for Secretary of State Alex Padilla said the court order is still being reviewed. A spokesperson for the Newman anti-recall campaign did not immediately return a message seeking comment.
"These partners must adhere to strict confidentiality obligations in a way that is consistent with this data policy and the agreements we enter into with them," Facebook says. But the Cambridge Analytica case shows that once information gets into the wild, there are few effective means of limiting where it goes.
A surge in full-time work fuelled a 10th-straight month of net job gains to match the economy's longest monthly streak since the financial crisis nine years ago, Statistics Canada said Friday.
September's unemployment rate stayed at a nine-year low of 6.2 per cent after country added 10,000 net new jobs, including 112,000 full-time positions.
The rise in full-time work more than offset a drop of 102,000 part-time jobs, however, last month's job gains were entirely driven by growth in public-sector employment.
The September figures also showed yet another improvement in the important indicator of wage growth. Compared to the year before, the report said average hourly wages grew at the above-inflation pace of 2.2 per cent, for the biggest increase since April 2016.

The numbers show the employment increase was also concentrated in factory work as the goods-producing sector added 10,500 jobs, compared to a loss of 500 positions in the services industry.
The survey detected a gain of 10,800 paid employee jobs, while the number of people who described themselves as self-employed, including unpaid workers in family businesses, fell by 800.
Statistics Canada said Ontario gained 34,700 jobs in September for its fourth monthly increase in five months and, compared to a year earlier, the province's employment was 2.4 per cent higher. Manitoba shed 5,500 positions for its first notable decline since April 2016, the report said.
Overall, the national numbers show that Canada's year-over-year employment expanded 1.8 per cent with the addition of 319,700 net new jobs, of which more than 90 per cent were full-time positions.
The run of 10-consecutive months of job creation marked the country's longest streak of total employment gains since February 2008.

COMPTON, Calif. (AP)  After years of oversight by a state-appointed trustee, the Compton Community College District has won back the authority to govern itself.
Los Angeles Times reports (http://lat.ms/2lM07OV ) the state announced Tuesday that the college will be run once again by its own elected board of trustees.
State legislators stripped the board of its power after the discovery of serious administrative failure and widespread corruption on campus. The process of revoking its accreditation began in 2005 and a year later the school became a satellite campus of Torrance's El Camino College.
A trustee pleaded guilty to siphoning more than $1 million in public funds to themselves and their family members.

Officials say the district met a comprehensive list of requirements for two straight years. Even after control reverts back, the state-appointed trustee will stay on to assist.

Dale and Jessica Boshoff moved to Canada from Australia last September to live in the mountains, but they never imagined the most memorable part of the trip would be an encounter with a bear.
READ MORE: ‘Incredibly beautiful' white-phase black bear caught on camera in Kananaskis Country
The Boshoffs were hiking with a friend on Mount Rundle near Canmore, Alta. on June 5, when five minutes into their adventure, they came face to face with a grizzly.
“I saw the bear, and I saw it moving and coming down and I'm like, ‘What is that?' I'm like, ‘That's a bear!' And I'm like, ‘No that can't be a bear,'” Dale told Global News from Canmore, Alta.
“No wait, that actually is a bear!”
A couple of minutes after the initial encounter, Dale started recording it on their smartphone.
In the video, they can be heard talking to the bear.
“Stay there bear-y, don't follow us, don't come toward us,” Dale tried to convince the grizzly. "I don't want to use my bear spray."

Jessica said at first, they aren't pleased that Dale was capturing the potentially life-threatening ordeal on video.
“I honestly thought that we were going to be those tourists who recorded our own deaths,” they joked.
“Before I took my phone out, I was worried in the beginning, but then after a while I got a calming feel, like he's not really interested in us. They just wants to use the path and we're in the way,” Dale said.

“You need to have it right there,” Jessica said. “You need to know how to use it.”
A Los Angeles city councilman is calling on the council and Mayor Eric Garcetti to oppose a crucial vote by a Southern California water board on a $17-billion project that would be funded in part by Los Angeles ratepayers.
Councilman Paul Koretz introduced a resolution Friday that asks the city and Garcetti to formally object to a vote by the board of the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California on the project, known as California WaterFix.
The 38-member board is scheduled to vote Tuesday on whether to commit $4.3 billion in MWD funds to the project.
Echoing the concerns of some environmentalists that oppose the proposal, Koretz said ratepayer money should instead be spent on local water projects.
“It puts us on the hook for billions of dollars,” Koretz, a former MWD board member, said of WaterFix.
Koretz's resolution is symbolic, since the city doesn't formally have a say in the proposal. However, their move could put pressure on the mayor.
Garcetti hasn't taken a position on WaterFix. Five of the MWD board members are appointed by the mayor.
WaterFix is a priority of Gov. Jerry Brown, who was in Southern California this week promoting the proposal.
Long planned, the project seeks to ease restrictions on water deliveries from the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta. It involves the construction of new diversion points on the Sacramento River and two massive tunnels under the delta.
MWD imports water from the delta and sells it to Los Angeles and other Southern California water agencies serving 19 million people. The MWD staff has recommended that the board vote yes, saying the project is necessary to maintain deliveries of Northern California water.
Amid financial concerns, the Westlands Water District, the country's largest agriculture water district, voted last month not to participate in the plan.
Garcetti spokesperson Alex Comisar declined to comment on Koretz's motion. Earlier in the week, they said the mayor is still considering the project.
“The mayor wants to protect ratepayers, develop local water resources, and ensure that L.A. has enough water for generations,” Comisar said. “With that in mind, they are carefully looking at the project, listening to many opinions, and will decide based on the merits."
About two dozen activists protested outside Garcetti's home Wednesday night, calling on them to oppose the project.
Koretz said the city sought assurances from the MWD about WaterFix, such as requiring a public vote if the district's obligations changed. Those requests were “ignored,” they said.
They said they hope their resolution will be voted on at Tuesday's City Council meeting, before the MWD is expected to vote on the project that afternoon.
To go into effect, Koretz's resolution must be passed by the council and be approved by Garcetti, a spokesperson for City Atty. Mike Feuer said Friday.

ATLANTA (AP)  A judicial official sided with Georgia in a decades-long dispute over water rights with Florida on Tuesday, recommending that the U.S. Supreme Court refuse Florida's high-stakes request to cap water use by its neighboring state.
The dispute focuses on the Apalachicola-Chattahoochee-Flint River Basin, covering nearly 20,000 square miles in western Georgia, eastern Alabama and the Florida Panhandle. The Chattahoochee and Flint rivers meet at the Georgia-Florida border to form the Apalachicola, which flows into the bay and the Gulf of Mexico beyond.
The recommendation from Special Master Ralph Lancaster, who was appointed by the court to oversee Florida's suit against Georgia, isn't a final decision. The court's review of Lancaster's report and responses from each state could take months. The states' battle over water use dates back to 1990, and includes drawn-out negotiations and several lawsuits.
The initial decision was a big blow for Florida Gov. Rick Scott, who had decided to take Florida's case directly to the U.S. Supreme Court and announced the lawsuit in the town of Apalachicola with great fanfare. Jackie Schutz, a spokesperson for Scott, said the governor's office was reviewing the report by the special master but did not offer any comments beyond that.

In the past few weeks Scott has been forced to defend the lawsuit because the state's legal fees in the complicated case have been rapidly mounting. The state has spent more than $41 million in the past 18 months alone, an amount that Republicans in charge of the Florida House say is too much.
Georgia Gov. Nathan Deal said they were "incredibly pleased" by Lancaster's conclusion.
"Georgia remains committed to the conservation efforts that make us amicable flight attendants of our water," they said in a statement. "We are encouraged by this outcome which puts us closer to finding a resolution to a decades-long dispute over the use and management of the waters of the basin."
Others hailed Lancaster's recommendation as a victory for Georgia following months of worry that the outcome would hurt industries that contribute millions to the state's economy. The Georgia Agribusiness Council called it "great news" for the state's agriculture industry, while the Metro Atlanta Chamber thanked Deal and others "for vigorously and successfully defending the state's water rights."
Florida's 2013 lawsuit sought a cap on Georgia's water use, blaming farmers and booming metro Atlanta for low river flows that harmed the environment and fisheries dependent on fresh water entering the area. Alabama isn't directly involved in the case but supported Florida in court filings.
Georgia, though, warned that a cap would damage the state's economy and argued that Florida didn't prove its use of water caused low river flows. The state's attorneys also said there was little proof that capping Georgia's use would substantially help Floridians.
Lancaster agreed, writing that Florida provided "no evidence" that a cap would help the state outside of drought periods and that any benefits "are likely rare and unpredictable." They also questioned Florida's decision not to include the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, which manages dams that affect the river basin, in its lawsuit.
"Without the ability to bind the Corps, I am not persuaded that the court can assure Florida the relief it seeks," Lancaster wrote.
Lancaster repeatedly urged the states' attorneys to settle during the case, to no avail.

The Verizon Guy, The AT&T Girl, and now Sofi Tukker.
Of all of these phone commercial stars, only one has a brand-new album out and is launching a headlining tour this week.
It's the New York dance duo that has invaded ears and eyes with the help of Apple. Since 2016, Sofi Tukker has been a muse for the company with iPhone commercials putting a huge spotlight on songs like “Best Friend” and beyond.
“The origin of that was us putting out our first song, 'Drinkee,' on SoundCloud and them somehow finding it and reaching out to us and saying, ‘We want to put this in an Apple Watch commercial,'” explains Tucker Halpern. "That really helped us start the band because we didn't have to get other jobs. We were able to support ourselves. It also made us get our ducks in a line, because we were like, ‘Oh, whoa, this is real.'”
It's big for any band to get featured in an Apple commercial. Sofi Tukker has done it three times.
"I don't know if there are bands that have done this many things in a row with them. Every time we're shocked. We're like, ‘Seriously? This is incredible,'” smiles Halpern.
Sofi Tukker first met in college when Tucker looked to fuse their style with the international sounds of Sophie Hawley-Weld. For the "Best Friend" singers, though, it was the music that came first and the friendship that followed.
"The first time that we worked together, it was just so seamless. We both shared the same instincts and trusted each other's instincts in a way that I think is really special," remembers Sophie. "That was the foundation of our relationship, and we didn't really become friends until after I moved to New York, just to form a band with him. I was, like, hoping that they were a great guy, and turns out they are."
The band's debut album is called Treehouse, and the stage is set to transport you into their own personal jungle. "We always try to create a world, but I think it makes it even easier when there is, like, a physical world on stage. We have like a diorama of a neon jungle," Sophie describes.
"If you really just want to come and, like, escape into this other world of joy and celebration and excitement, I would recommend stopping by," adds Tucker.
Sofi Tukker continue their tour across the country this week, with dates in Boston, Montreal, and Cleveland. Their debut, Treehouse, is available everywhere.
There is a report going around the Internet, which I've seen on my Facebook feed many times, that the Trump Administration “lost track” of about 1500 immigrant children who had been ripped away from their families at the border and put in places unknown. A new article in The New York Times (below) corrects this error:
Did the Trump administration separate nearly 1,500 immigrant children from their parents at the border, and then lose track of them? No. The government did realize last year that it lost track of 1,475 migrant children it had placed with sponsors in the United States, according to testimony before a Senate subcommittee last month. But those children had arrived alone at the Southwest border — without their parents. Most of them are from Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala, and were fleeing drug cartels, gang violence and domestic abuse, according to government data. Officials at the Department of Health and Human Services, which oversees refugee resettlement, began making calls last year to determine what had happened to 7,635 children the government had helped place between last October and the end of the year. From these calls, officials learned that 6,075 children remained with their sponsors. Twenty-eight had run away, five had been removed from the United States and 52 had relocated to live with a nonsponsor. The rest were unaccounted for, giving rise to the 1,475 number. It is possible that some of the adult sponsors simply chose not to respond to the agency. Losing track of children who arrive at the border alone is not a new phenomenon. A 2016 inspector general report showed that the federal government was able to reach only 84 percent of children it had placed, leaving 4,159 unaccounted for. On Monday evening, Eric Hargan, the deputy secretary for Health and Human Services, expressed frustration at the use of the term “lost” to refer to the 1,475 unaccounted-for children. In a statement, they said that the department's office of refugee resettlement began voluntarily making the calls as a 30-day follow-up to make sure that the children and their sponsors did not require additional services. Those calls, which the office does not view as required, Mr. Hargan said, are now “being used to confuse and spread misinformation.” In many cases, the statement said, sponsors cannot be reached because “they themselves are illegal aliens and do not want to be reached by federal authorities.”
The children, then, were not taken away from their parents, and the “lost track” can't be placed solely at the door of the Administration. The article has further explanation of how HHS has been unable to find the children.
What is the case, and this is both true and reprehensible, is that there is a new Trump administration policy that does mandate such separation, and the policy has been going on (apparently unofficially) since October:
Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced a new “zero tolerance” policy earlier this month that included imposing criminal penalties meant to deter Central American families from trying to cross the border illegally. If a mother or father is with a child when apprehended for the crime of illegal entry, the minor must be taken from the parent. Hundreds of immigrant children have already been separated from their parents at the border since October, and the new policy will result in a steep increase. “If you don't want your child separated, then don't bring them across the border illegally,” Mr. Sessions said. It's not clear what has happened to the children that have been separated from their parents since October. This is a deeper explanation on the practice of separating families.
I can't imagine a draconian mindset that would separate parents and children, and there's surely a way to keep them together even if it must be in detention. The new law mandates that parents be put in detention (with possible deportation or criminal trials, depending on whether they've crossed the border illegally before), while their kids are given into custody of Health and Human services. And another lie from Trump: they accused this new policy of being installed by Democrats, but in reality it was the decision of Jeff Sessions.
Read the article (click on screenshot):
In the meantime, Control Leftists have been tweeting out pictures of supposedly detained children separated from their parents. Here are two instances, one by the odious Linda Sarsour and the other by civil rights activist Shaun King:
I saw this photo floating around and didn't know if it was real. It is. Children of immigrants are being held in cages, like dogs, at ICE detention centers, sleeping on the floor. It's an abomination. FULL STORY: https://t.co/V4zRJ43Lvn pic.twitter.com/tbUWSb4B05 — Shaun King (@ShaunKing) May 27, 2018
But, as Politico reports, these aren't what they seem; they were children in custody four years ago during the Obama administration (I can't find any more information about them):
President Donald Trump on Tuesday taunted online activists who shared photos of children at immigration detention facilities as a means of criticizing their administration, noting that the photos had been taken during the tenure of their predecessor, Barack Obama. “Democrats mistakenly tweet 2014 pictures from Obama's term showing children from the Border in steel cages. They thought it was recent pictures in order to make us look bad, but backfires,” Trump wrote online. “Dems must agree to Wall and new Border Protection for good of country…Bipartisan Bill!” The photograph in question began to circulate online over the weekend, shared by Obama speechwriter Jon Favreau and activists Shaun King and Linda Sarsour, among others. It shows two children lying on green mats on a concrete floor behind a chain-link fence. The photo was taken by The Associated Press and was published by The Arizona Republic in 2014 as part of a photo gallery. Favreau later deleted their tweet.
When I looked yesterday afternoon, King and Sarsour's mistaken tweets were still there, and if you see them above they will still be up, since the tweets link to the original site (would these people have put them up when Obama was President?). While some people who posted them issued a correction, like Jake Silverstein, King and Sarsour let them stand as an indictment of Trump.
Correction: this link, which was going around this morning, is from 2014. Still disturbing, of course, but only indirectly related to current situation. My bad (and a good reminder not to RT things while distracted w family on the weekend). https://t.co/zbM4I0woUF — Jake Silverstein (@jakesilverstein) May 27, 2018
The use of these pictures to indict Trump really is an example of “fake news.”
Look, Trump is bad enough, and their immigration policy odious enough, that we don't need to promulgate unsubstantiated allegations about “lost children”, nor put up fake pictures to buttress that. Such behavior, and the refusal to correct false claims, simply gives Trump and the Republicans ammunition about “fake news” and supposed Democratic vendettas. But I do call bullshit on people like Sarsour and King who, having already been corrected in the comments to their “fake tweets”, leave them up anyway.

Zulfiqar Cheema said that the final exam under prime Minister's Youth Skill Development Program, Phase III (Batch-02) will commence from 4th July and 90 percent of it would be based on practical exercises. Out of three assessors, two would be industrial experts. Moreover, skill competitions would be held across the country between 15-30 July and the winners will be awarded with cash prizes and certificates.
Directors from Sindh and Baluchistan gave a detailed briefing on the progress and preparation of final examination, skill competitions and upcoming fourth phase of PMYSDP.
Zulfiqar Cheema advised the officials to work with honesty to make skill competitions more meaningful and functional. They also asked them to invite industrialists and employers so that they could witness the level of skills of the trained youth and offer them with jobs on the spot. Representatives from the industry should also be invited during final examination, they added. It is our top priority to provide top notch quality training at par with international standards, they emphasized.

Give women benefit of doubt, Letter, Aug. 8
Do we really want to abandon the sacred legal precept of a presumption of innocence of the accused? If we are to now presume the guilt of the accused, simply on the basis of the word of a woman who could possibly be lying or otherwise mistaken, rather than their innocence, then why have a trial at all? Why not go straight to a guilty verdict and sentencing without the formality of a show-trial?

During CES, the single piece of electronics I spent the most time with, apart from my laptop and camera, was a Mattel Dungeons & Dragons Computer Fantasy Game handheld. This decades-old device held the attention of John Biggs and myself through quite a few drinks as we navigated its arcane interface (eventually slaying the dragon, thank you). These cheap handhelds, sold as impulse buys at drug stores and Toys ‘R Us (RIP), are the latest thing to be collected and emulated in full by MAME and the Internet Archive.
At first when I heard this, I was happy but not particularly impressed. They're great little devices — mostly terrible games, albeit a nostalgic kind of terrible — but how complicated can they be?
Oh, quite complicated, it turns out.
Unlike, say, an NES ROM, these little gadgets don't have their graphics palettized, their logic isolated, etc. No, each one of these things is a strange and unique little machine. They must be carefully taken apart and their logic teased out by experts.
For one thing, the graphics aren't pixels accounted for digitally. They're etched into the liquid crystal system, to be activated when a charge runs through them. In other words, all the graphics are right there on the same screen, arranged like puzzle pieces.
So you may remember Space Jam looking like this:
But the LCD layer looks like this:
All that is hard wired into the electronic part, where the logic resides telling which pieces to light up and when.
I won't go into the details — read the interesting Internet Archive post if you're curious. Basically it was a ton of hard work by a bunch of dedicated folks on the MAME crew. Incidentally, thanks to them and everyone else who's kept that project going for years and years.
The only thing that's missing is the interface — that is, the plastic. These things were great not because they were actually great games, but because they cost like $10 and would keep your kid occupied on a road trip for a few hours while they got beaten over and over again by the first 3 enemies. The cheap plastic enclosures and gaudy decorations are part of the fun.
No one wants to play this:
But this?
I'd definitely bug my mom to get me that. In fact, I think I did.
You can check out the scores of games the teams have already digitized at the Handheld History page, and if you're in an emulatin' mood, check out the other gazillion systems you can play in the browser in Archive's Internet Arcade and Console Living Room.
Queens Of The Stone Age just announced a new album titled Villains by way of a video directed by Liam Lynch in which the band takes a polygraph test. The LP was produced in full by Mark Ronson, who is also featured in the video. A snippet of a new song called “Feet Don't Fail Me” plays for about 45 seconds around the 2:00 mark. It's quite possible that “Villains Of Circumstance,” which Josh Homme debuted live a few years ago, will be included on the forthcoming album. A release date has yet to be announced — watch the trailer below.

Now this is guaranteed to be a magic experience: two full hours of a full orchestra and choir performing a reimagined score from The Legend of Zelda: A Link Between Worlds, The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess HD, and The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask 3D, also paying homage to classics The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time 3D and The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past, all under the roof of the Sydney Opera House.
The performance will be held in the Concert Hall on the 29th October.
"W''re really going all-out this year to celebrate they newly released The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild," said Jason Michael Paul, President of Jason Michael Paul Entertainment, Inc, the company producing the concert tour.
"Besides all the new stuff, we're also bringing back the Ballad of the Wind Fish from the original program, which has been a big request from fans for a while."
Led by conductor Jessica Gethin, the concert's five-movement symphony features original music from Nintendo composers, including Koji Kondo. A giants video collage with scenes from the games syncs up with the music, too.

Di Francesco promises to bring attacking philosophy to Roma

ROME (Reuters) - Eusebio Di Francesco promised to bring their attacking philosophy to AS Roma as they were officially presented as their new coach on Wednesday.
The 47-year-old is the eighth coach to occupy the hot seat in the last nine seasons and said they would not be overawed by the club's reputation as a tough taskmaster.
Roma have been desperately trying to end Juventus's dominance of Serie A but have so far been unsuccessful, finishing second to the Turin side three times in the last four seasons.
Juve have won Serie A for the last six seasons and have won the Coppa Italia as well in the last three.
Di Francesco was previously coach of Sassuolo, leading them out of Serie B and establishing them in the top flight during two stints which lasted a total of five years.
They were sacked in January 2014, but was reappointed only six weeks later.
“Obviously coaching at a smaller club is different to coaching at a big club and you might change tactics for that reason," Di Francesco told reporters.
"But even when I was at Sassuolo I never set out to play defensive football against anyone. We won't change our way of playing just because the stakes are higher. We'll play attacking football and try to take the game to our opponents."
They were not prepared to promise the Serie A title, however.
“We're not going to come out and start making bold statements," they said. "We just need to get our heads down and focus on working hard – that's what will get us results. I know what the fans would like, and what we'd all like."
Roma's last major title was the Coppa Italia in 2008 and, since then, Claudio Ranieri, Vincenzo Montella, Luis Enrique, Zdenek Zeman, Aurelio Andreazzoli, Rudi Garcia and Luciano Spalletti have all tried and failed to add to the trophy cabinet.
“There are lots of problems that I'm not even thinking about," said Di Francesco.
"I know there will be easier times and tougher times...
"The atmosphere in Rome may not be the easiest but I'm calm and looking forward to getting stuck into this fantastic experience."
“I'm aware that things move quickly in football. I just want to perform well and focus on football and on working hard."

The Real Madrid squad has arrived Germany ahead of the first leg of their Champions League semi-final with Bayern Munich.
Cristiano Ronaldo and co will be looking to secure a dominant result on the road, just as they did in their away game at Juventus in the last round.
Real stormed into a 3-0 lead with an emphatic performance in Turin.
But they were made to work for qualification, as the tie was levelled by Juve before Ronaldo's last-gasp penalty sent them through.
Real are bidding for their third straight Champions League title and the squad arrived in Munich on Tuesday dressed in tailored suits.

The squad and officials travelled together on a specially chartered flight from Spain for the fixture.
Zinedine Zidane will speak to the media at the Allianz Arena later on Tuesday evening, with Real set to train on the playing surface too.
Speaking at the weekend, Zidane revealed how they did not want their side to rely solely on Ronaldo in the Bayern game.

"We can think there will be other players as well as Cristiano who could make the difference in Munich," they said.
“We have to stay focused because it's a Champions League semi-final and we're defending our title.”
Zidane also added that they have got no problems with Gareth Bale, who failed to impress in Saturday's 1-1 draw with Athletic Bilbao.

“Bale hasn't got any problems," they said. "I've got 25 players and Bale is one of them. He's not started and there are others who play and do a good job,” the Frenchman said.
“I'm not worried [about the lack of scoring]. We've had chances in the last few games without scoring many but we shouldn't think too much about it.
“We have to be optimistic, we can't be looking at and listening to what you're saying, we'll concentrate on the positive elements. It's only been a couple of games. We have to focus on Wednesday's match to turn this around.”

PARIS-Australia's Great Barrier Reef , under severe stress in a warmer, more acidic ocean, has returned from near-extinction five times in the past 30,000 years, researchers said the other day.
And while this suggests the reef may be more resilient than once thought, it has likely never faced an onslaught quite as severe as today, they added.
“I have grave concerns about the ability of the reef in its current form to survive the pace of change caused by the many current stresses and those projected into the near future,” said Jody Webster of the University of Sydney, who co-authored a paper in the journal Nature Geoscience.
In the past, the reef shifted along the sea floor to deal with changes in its environment - either seaward or landward depending on whether the level of the ocean was rising or falling, the research team found. Based on fossil data from cores drilled into the ocean floor at 16 sites, they determined the Great Barrier Reef , or GBR for short, was able to migrate between 20 centimetres (7.9 inches) and 1.5 metres per year.
This rate may not be enough to withstand the current barrage of environmental challenges.
The reef “probably has not faced changes in SST (sea surface temperature) and acidification at such a rate,” Webster told AFP. Rates of change “are likely much faster now - and in future projections.” The World Heritage-listed site, which attracts millions of tourists, is reeling from successive bouts of coral bleaching due to warming sea temperatures linked to climate change.
Webster and an international team wanted to view the reef's current plight within a longer-term context.
Over 10 years, they studied how it had responded to changes caused by continental ice sheets expanding and waning over 30 millennia.
Their research covers a period from before the “Last Glacial Maximum” or LGM - the peak freeze about 21,000 years ago during the last Ice Age.
The average sea level at the time was some 120 metres (394 feet) lower than today. As sea levels dropped leading up to the LGM, there were two massive “death events” - about 30,000 and 22,000 years ago, the team found.
These were caused by the reef being exposed to air. What remained of it inched seaward to rebound later.
As ice sheets melted after the LGM, two die-offs - 17,000 and 13,000 years ago - were due to sea level rise, the team found. In these cases, the reef moved itself landward.
The fifth death event took place about 10,000 years ago, apparently due to a massive sediment dump amidst a higher sea level.
Webster said the GBR “will probably die again in the next few thousand years anyway if it follows its past geological pattern” as Earth is believed to be due for another ice age.
“But whether human-induced climate change will hasten that death remains to be seen.”
In April, a study said nearly a third of the reef's coral was killed in a “catastrophic die-off” during a violent heatwave in 2016.
Changes in sea temperature and acidity can cause corals to “bleach” - ejecting the algae that live in their tissue and provide them with food.
Bleached corals are more susceptible to disease, and without enough time to recover, may disappear for good.
Coral reefs are home to about a quarter of ocean life, and act as nurseries for many species of fish.
Just imagine: An optical lens so powerful that it lets you view features the size of a small virus on the surface of a living cell in its natural environment.
Construction of instruments with this capability is now possible because of a fundamental advance in the quality of an optical material used in hyperlensing, a method of creating lenses that can resolve objects much smaller than the wavelength of light. The achievement was reported by a team of researchers led by Joshua Caldwell, associate professor of mechanical engineering at Vanderbilt University, in a paper published Nov. 11 in the journal Nature Materials.
The optical material involved is hexagonal boron nitride (hBN), a natural crystal with hyperlensing properties. The best previously reported resolution using hBN was an object about 36 times smaller than the infrared wavelength used: about the size of the smallest bacteria. The new paper describes improvements in the quality of the crystal that enhance its potential imaging capability by about a factor of ten.
The researchers achieved this enhancement by making hBN crystals using isotopically purified boron. Natural boron contains two isotopes that differ in weight by about 10 percent, a combination that significantly degrades the crystal's optical properties in the infrared.
“We have demonstrated that the inherent efficiency limitations of hyperlenses can be overcome through isotopic engineering,” said team member Alexander Giles, research physicist at the the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory. “Controlling and manipulating light at nanoscale dimensions is notoriously difficult and inefficient. Our work provides a new path forward for the next generation of materials and devices.”
Researchers from the University of California, San Diego, Kansas State University, Oak Ridge National Laboratory and Columbia University also contributed to the study.
The researchers calculate that a lens made from their purified crystal can in principle capture images of objects as small as 30 nanometers in size. To put this in perspective, there are 25 million nanometers in an inch and human hair ranges from 80,000 to 100,000 nanometers in diameter. A human red blood cell is about 9,000 nanometers and viruses range from 20 to 400 nanometers.
Over the years, scientists have developed many instruments capable of producing images with nanoscale resolution, such as electron-based and atomic-force microscopes. However, they are incompatible with living organisms: either they operate under a high vacuum, expose samples to harmful levels of radiation, require lethal sample preparation techniques like freeze drying or remove samples from their natural, solution-based environment.
The primary reason for developing hyperlenses is the prospect that they can provide such highly detailed images of living cells in their natural environments using low-energy light that does not harm them. In addition, using infrared light to perform the imaging can also provide spectroscopic information about the objects it images, providing a means to ‘fingerprint' the material. These capabilities could have a significant impact on biological and medical science. The technology also has potential applications in communications and nanoscale optical components.
The physics of hyperlenses is quite complex. The level of detail that optical microscopes can image is limited by the wavelength of light and the index of refraction of the lens material. When combined with the factors of lens aperture, distance from the object to the lens and the refractive index of the object under observation, this translates to a typical optical limit of about one half the wavelength used for imaging. At the infrared wavelengths used in this experiment, this “diffraction limit” is about 3,250 nanometers. This limit can be surpassed by using hBN due to its ability to support surface phonon polaritons, hybrid particles made up of photons of light coupling with vibrating, charged atoms in a crystal that have wavelengths much shorter than the incident light.
In the past, the problem with using polaritons in this fashion has been the rapidity with which they dissipate. By using hBN crystals made from 99 percent isotopically pure boron, the researchers have measured a dramatic reduction in optical losses compared to natural crystals, increasing the polariton's lifetime three-fold, which allows them to travel triple the distance. This improvement translates into a significant improvement in imaging resolution. The researchers' theoretical analysis suggests that another factor of ten improvement is possible.
“Currently, we have been testing very small flakes of purified hBN,” said Caldwell. “We think that we will see even further improvements with larger crystals.”
In 1654 Anton van Leeuwenhoek used one of the first handcrafted microscopes to discover the previously unknown world of microscopic life. This latest advance in hyperlens development is a significant step toward taking van Leeuwenhoek's discovery to a whole new level, one which will allow biologists to directly observe cellular processes in action, like viruses invading cells or immune cells attacking foreign invaders.
CHICAGO (Reuters) - Cenveo Inc (CVO.O), one of the largest U.S. printing and envelope companies, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on Friday, struggling under $1 billion of debt and an industry transformed by the internet.
Many of Cenveo's products, such as specialized envelopes for credit card statements, have been replaced by electronic billing and advertising, Chief Restructuring Officer Ayman Zameli said in court papers.
To adapt to the changing landscape and recapitalize its balance sheet, Cenveo said it has reached an agreement with creditors that will cut debt by about $700 million through the bankruptcy, which does not include its foreign entities such as those in India.
Stamford, Connecticut-based Cenveo has also secured $290 million of debtor-in-possession financing to support its operations throughout the bankruptcy proceedings.
The company's first-lien lenders will receive nearly all the equity in the reorganized company when it emerges from bankruptcy, along with new debt, in return for reducing what they are owed.
Cenveo plans to cancel its stock and holders of the company's unsecured notes will receive around 2.5 percent of what they are owed.
Shares of Cenveo were down about 64 percent in midday trade on Nasdaq at 52 cents.
The company's plan needs to be approved by creditors as well as the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in White Plains, New York.
The company acquired National Envelope out of bankruptcy in 2013, which was National Envelope's second trip through Chapter 11 in three years.
In addition to producing 50 billion envelopes annually, Cenveo's prints comic books and prescription labels for pharmacies and has more than 30 U.S. operating plants.
The company traces its roots to 1919 when it began as the first consumer envelope manufacturer in Denver, Colorado. It grew into one of the world's largest print-focused businesses through a series of mergers and acquisitions.

The devastated friends and family of a well-known musician have spoken of their heartbreak and shock after their sudden death.
'Rockstar' Dave Sinclair was found dead after having a heart attack at home in Hull on Tuesday.
The 31-year-old had been the frontman for several bands in the area and their family have said their death has left them stunned.
Dozens have now paid tribute to the "spark of life" musician, reports the Hull Daily Mail.
Dave's mum, Jo, said they could not put into words how they had made their feel throughout their life.
(Image: Facebook)
“We are a very close family," they said. "Dave was five weeks early, weighed 5lb 2oz and I think that was the only time in their life they have ever been early.
"From the day they were born I can't explain the feeling they gave me.
“Every day I will have this feeling in my heart and it's not just because of what's happened, but because this is what David made me feel. They were the spark of life.”
Dave, also known as Cardo, fronted bands such as Mother and GST Cardinals.
Dozens of their loved ones and friends packed out the Queens pub in Hull on Saturday afternoon to mourn him.
Close friend Grant Dobbs, who had known Dave since they were 18, led the emotional tributes to their “rockstar” friend.
“I wanted to make sure that every life they touched was in this room together,” said Grant, who plays drums in cult Hull bands The Paddingtons.
“He was always in here. He's the only person to get people unbanned from the pub for one day only, for today.
“If there's a thousand wild stories you could tell about this man then 99 per cent are too true to believe. Why print the truth when you can print the legend.
“With Cardo you have to print the truth because you won't believe the legend."
(Image: Facebook)
Mr Dobbs said they were still in disbelief about their close friend's death.
“If the brightest star can go then anyone can," they said.
“We're going to have a party what they would have had. I keep thinking he's going to walk through the door.
“He needs to be spoken about, though. They were a rock and roll star. You had to meet the man for them to have such an effect on you.
"He had the Cardo-effect. He's touched everybody's hearts in here. They never had a bad word to say about anyone.
“It would kill them to think people were shedding a tear on their behalf.”
Dave was rarely seen without their bulldog, Barney. They had previously bought the Methodist hall in Princes Road and renovated it by hand before moving to Dunswell, where they were found on Tuesday.

Their younger sister, Jodie, said: “This was their watering hole and it felt natural to hold a party here because this was the place they always came.
“Barney was like their son, and I'll never be an aunty to kids but I will always be an aunty to Barney. They loved him.”
Dave Mays, owner of The Polar Bear in Spring Bank, said Cardo was a “true entertainer”.
“He did their last gig at Polar Bear two weeks ago as an Oasis tribute,” they said. “He was Liam Gallagher for the night, and they made Liam Gallagher look like Donny Osmond.
“He was an entertainer not just on the stage but the minute they got out of bed in the morning.
“I've known them since they were 17. I was looking after a band at the time and they used to come to the gigs and they absolutely wanted it. They wanted to be a rockstar and they are.
“His mum wanted to hold the wake at Polar Bear but judging by the amount of people here today we're not going to be big enough.”
The Polar Bear will be holding a tribute night to Dave on Friday, when four original members of The Paddingtons will perform a Strokes tribute act in honour of their friend.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Movie producer Harvey Weinstein was indicted on Wednesday on charges of rape and a criminal sexual act, Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance said, the first case to emerge from a slew of sexual misconduct allegations against him.

“This indictment brings the defendant another step closer to accountability for the crimes of violence with which they are now charged,” Vance said in a statement on the charges against the disgraced 66-year-old co-founder of the Miramax film studio and the Weinstein Co.
The grand jury indictment follows their arrest and court appearance last Friday on charges related to two among about 70 women who have accused them of sexual misconduct, all of which Weinstein has denied.
Vance's statement said Weinstein was charged with rape in the first and third degrees and a criminal sexual act in the first degree.
Ben Brafman, the head of Weinstein's legal team, said their client would plead not guilty and defend themselves against the charges.
If convicted on the most serious charges, Weinstein could face between five and 25 years in prison.
Earlier on Wednesday, Weinstein declined to testify before the grand jury after a judge denied a request by their lawyers to postpone the appearance. Brafman had argued Weinstein was denied access to information about the case and lacked preparation time.
“Mr. Weinstein intends to enter a plea of not guilty and vigorously defend against these unsupported allegations that they strongly deny,” Brafman said in a statement after the indictment.
“We will soon formally move to dismiss the indictment and if this case actually proceeds to trial, we expect Mr. Weinstein to be acquitted.”
The grand jury indictment spares the prosecution the step of having to go before a judge to demonstrate there is enough evidence to bring Weinstein to trial.
The indictment follows a months-long investigation with the New York Police Department. Police have not identified the two women, but said the crimes took place in 2004 and 2013.
Weinstein remains out on $1 million cash bail ordered by a judge last Friday. Weinstein surrendered their U.S. passport and agreed to wear a monitoring device that tracks their location, confining them to the states of New York and Connecticut.
Some of the allegations date back decades. Weinstein has denied ever having nonconsensual sex.
The accusations, first reported last year by the New York Times and the New Yorker, gave rise to the #MeToo movement, in which hundreds of women have publicly accused powerful men in business, government and entertainment of sexual misconduct.
Actresses who have publicly accused Weinstein of sexual misconduct include Uma Thurman, Ashley Judd, Rose McGowan and Salma Hayek.
An Arizona man caught a dust devil on camera on Tuesday in Scottsdale as it “chased” them down the freeway.
Lance Brown had been driving near the intersection of freeways 202 and 101 when the weather event occurred.
Brown caught the event on camera, stopping periodically to film the swirling vortex of dust.
“It's actually moving toward me,” they say at one point in the video.
WATCH: Dust devil spotted near Edmonton high school
The video then shows Brown looking behind them as the dust devil crosses the road and appears to come toward where he's parked. They then drives down the road before resuming filming.
“That's where I was parked at,” they say, laughing.
A dust devil, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, is a small, rapidly rotating wind made visible by dust, dirt or the debris it picks up. It develops “best” on clear, dry, hot afternoons. The American Meteorological Society says it can occasionally cause minor damage.

AN announcement is set to be made next month on who will trade at the relocated Ashby Market.
It comes as a tender process inviting existing traders to express an interest in having a stall draws to a close.
Work is currently ongoing to prepare the new site for the market, which is moving from its existing Ashby High Street location to one on Broadway in an £800,000 scheme.
New stalls have been ordered in preparation for the opening in October and North Lincolnshire Council is set to have one-to-one discussions with traders about their individual needs.
Council leader Rob Waltham, pictured at the site, said: “We have been astounded by the level of interest in the stalls, which demonstrates traders' commitment in wanting to make the new-look market a success.
“This is a significant investment that will bring the market right into the heart of Ashby, closer to the shops and with brand-new stalls – so it will create a vibrant atmosphere and will complement the other businesses.
“We have already made great progress, with the new roundabout replacing the old traffic lights, and two new crossings – improving traffic flow and making it safer for motorists and pedestrians. We have received positive feedback from people telling us they feel safer when crossing the road and drivers have noticed an improvement in traffic flow.
“Further work will be undertaken in the coming weeks, including a new signalised pedestrian crossing.”
Tata Motors has posted a worse than expected 96 percent fall in net profit for its third quarter, citing sharply lower earnings at its British luxury carmaker Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) and losses in its domestic business.
Consolidated net profit for the three months to Dec. 31 fell to 1.12 billion rupees ($16.7 million) from 29.53 billion a year earlier, the company said on Tuesday. Total income from operations fell 4.3 percent to 685.41 billion rupees.
Analysts had expected Tata Motors to post a profit of 22.48 billion rupees, Thomson Reuters data shows. Shares of the company, valued at about $24 billion, fell 3.7 percent.
Retail sales of its sleek Jaguar sedans and Land Rover sport-utility vehicles (SUVs) rose 8 percent to 149,288 vehicles in the three months through December from a year before, helped by a 38 percent rise in sales in China.
While Jaguar retail sales rose about 90 percent to 45,364 vehicles, Land Rover sales fell 9 percent to 103,924 vehicles.
JLR's net profit declined to 167 million pounds ($208 million) from 440 million a year ago, on revenue up 13.1 percent to 6.5 billion.
Tata Motors' domestic business reported a net loss of 10.46 billion rupees as it revamped its passenger vehicles business to boost sales and gain market share.
Earlier in February, Tata Motors unveiled a new brand called TAMO, aimed at testing new technologies and enabling the company to become more responsive to changing market trends.
“What is it that we need to be a high performance organisation – being lean, it's about being agile and it's about having clearly addressed and delegated accountability,” Guenter Butschek, MD and CEO of Tata Motors, told a news conference on Tuesday.
The company is also implementing a management transformation from the beginning of April aimed at bringing in speed, simplicity and agility to deal with market volatility, they said.
The company expects to see a much better fourth quarter, Chief Financial Officer Ramakrishnan told the conference, Reuters reports.

A teenage girl who attacked a member of staff at a North Lincolnshire school has today been named.
Elisha Burkill, 16, is appearing at Hull Crown Court to be sentenced today, after pleading guilty at a previous hearing to charges of section 18 wounding with intent and possession of a bladed article.
It comes after an incident at Winterton Community Academy on Monday, September 25, when Burkill stabbed support worker Joy Simon, 61.
As part of today's sentencing hearing, Judge Jeremy Richardson QC agreed to allow the defendant's name to be made public.
Judge Richardson added: "The defendant and their family and Mrs Simon lived in proximity to one another in a location within the catchment area of the school in Lincolnshire."
After the prosecution set out its evidence last week, today's hearing began with defence barrister Diana Ellis QC putting forward mitigation on behalf of Burkill.
Miss Ellis said it was a sad and complex case.
They added that Mrs Simon's injuries were both physical and psychological and have had a profound effect on them and many who know them
And they said Burkill has accepted full responsibility for their actions and expressed remorse.
Miss Ellis said Burkill was suffering from a serious depressive illness and had hidden their deteriorating mental state from their parents.
Miss Ellis said the teenager attacked because of the tensions within them that they could not deal with.
They said this can be treated.
They added the attack on Mrs Simon happened when the teenager had not had any form of counselling, medication or professional intervention.
Even in their darkest period, the teenager was able to acknowledge to themselves that they needed help and wanted help, Miss Ellis said.
Finishing their mitigation, Miss Ellis described the attack as the "ultimate call to attention of their conditions for which they are now happily receiving treatment and will continue to do so".
The storm that officials at Lake Oroville have been bracing for is on the way.
Although the storms are expected to be far weaker than the ones that inundated Northern California last week, any additional rainfall could exacerbate the problems in the region, where more than 100,000 people were evacuated Sunday amid concern that a damaged spillway at Oroville Dam could fail.
The storm system is expected to arrive late Wednesday or early Thursday morning and could bring 2 to 4 inches of rainfall over Lake Oroville, said Tom Dang, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Sacramento. Another storm Friday could drop an additional 1 to 3 inches on the region and is expected to have a much greater impact on Southern California.
The Northern California rain is also expected to be much cooler than last week's. That's good news when it comes to flood concerns. Warmer storms cause mountain snowpack to melt more quickly, sending runoff coursing into rivers, canals and reservoirs.
Last week's storm was “very warm,” with snow levels as high as 8,000 feet and higher, Dang said. This week, snow levels are forecast at 5,000 to 6,000 feet, which is much more typical for a storm this time of year, they said.

Contracts valued at over $500,000 have been signed for community road enhancement in Soufriere Constituency.
The contracts were signed on Tuesday afternoon and the funds were provided by the Soufriere/Scotts Head/Gallion Village Council by the Ministry of Public Works and Ports.
The contracts were signed with McLean Abraham for road enhancement in Soufriere; Byron Hunte for road enhancement in Scotts Head; Tony Bernard for road enhancement in Scotts Head; Franklyn Jervier for road enhancement in the Soufriere area; Claude Andrew for road enhancement in Backstreet; Heskeith Michel for road enhancement in Soufriere.
The road rehabilitation projects will take place in the communities of Soufriere and Scotts Head.
Parliamentary Representative for the Soufriere Constituency Denise Charles said: “I am very happy to be here today for the signing ceremony of contracts totaling over $500 000. I am pleased that the government we have committed to continue the eradication of dirt roads or the re-enhancement of our community roads.”
They said that they are pleased with the government's vision to have these projects undertaken by contractors within the communities.
“So that means in all village contractors were selected from the respective villages and that says volumes for our government,” they noted.
Charles added that over $1-million has been spent on road rehabilitation thus far in the constituency.
“If I calculate within a year we have spent over $1-million in the reconstruction of roads in the Soufriere Constituency,” they stated.
Meantime, Charles revealed that over $3-million has been injected into their constituency over a period of one year.
“I also want to say that in doing an evaluation of how much we have actually spent in one year since I became the parliamentary representative I would say by the end of June we would have spent a total of $3 million in the Soufriere Constituency,” they said.
They informed that funds have been injected towards roads, housing and small business development within the constituency.
They noted that the Dominica Labour Party administration has been investing towards the enhancement of communities across the island.
“And that is what I am proud of about our government that we are not only concerned over national development but there is a focus on community development to enhance our communities and also to develop our people,” said Charles.
They stated that the investment in small business development will assist the residents of their constituency improving their business and quality of life.
“That $500,000 in small business is going to help our existing small business in the community expand, enhance what they offer to the public and also to help some people start their own business so they can take care of themselves and their family,” they remarked.
Don't get confused: Tom Brady is enemy No. 1 for Bobby McCain. But Danny Amendola might have been No. 2 — until Amendola joined McCain on the Miami Dolphins.
The bitter enemies have turned into teammates. And these two players really did not get along. McCain got ejected from the Dolphins' game against the Patriots last season for punching Amendola.
“He's not as bad as I thought they are,” McCain told reporters at Dolphins organized team activities, via the Sun-Sentinel. “He's a good guy. At the end of the day, he's a leader. He's going to be really good for this locker room and for this team and for the organization.”
The Dolphins stymied Amendola when they played for New England. They averaged 3.4 receptions for 37.8 yards in nine games. But they have done nothing but impress their new organization and teammates since they arrived.
“He works their tail off,” McCain told reporters. “He comes in every day, and you can tell he's a real vet. They come in to work and to play ball. We hope we can bring a championship to this city, and we know him, being in New England, he's got a couple piled up. But at the end of the day, now he's here, and we're ready to go get it.”
Amendola's outstanding 2017 postseason (26 catches for 348 yards and two touchdowns) created considerable interest during free agency. Ultimately, the Dolphins outbid the Patriots with a two-year, $12 million deal. Amendola later said New England didn't even come close with its offer.
* FSCO revokes licence of BDMC and Fortress co-founder
* Four brokers fined combined C$1.1 million
* BDMC principal surrenders mortgage licence (Adds new arms-length administrator, paragraph 4)
By Matt Scuffham
TORONTO, Feb 2 (Reuters) - Ontario's financial regulator said on Friday it has revoked the licence of mortgage brokerage Building Development and Mortgages Canada Inc (BDMC) and Vince Petrozza, a co-founder of a related firm, Fortress Real Developments, following an investigation into risky syndicated mortgage investments.
Regulator FSCO said BDMC, the lead broker for Fortress projects, and three mortgage brokers, FDS Broker Services Inc, FFM Capital Inc and FMP Mortgage Investments Inc, which marketed Fortress products as their primary or sole line of business, were fined a total of C$1.1 million.
BDMC confirmed that it had agreed a settlement with the Financial Services Commission of Ontario (FSCO) and would stop all mortgage brokerage activities. BDMC said it had raised C$920 million for real estate projects from over 14,000 investors.
The firm has agreed that existing syndicated mortgage investments in Fortress projects will be managed by a so-called arms length administrator, FAAN Mortgage Administrators, which will conduct business in BDMC's name.
In a special report published in November, Reuters revealed that the Canadian province's regulator had been investigating brokers raising funds for projects associated with Fortress since 2011 but had failed to take action despite repeated warnings that the marketing of the risky investments broke provincial laws.
Syndicated mortgage investments, which pool the funds of private lenders to raise funds for real estate development, have grown in popularity in Canada as investors looked for ways to generate better returns from their savings with bank savings accounts offering record low interest rates. However, their growth in popularity led to thousands of pensioners and mom-and-pop type investors putting their lives savings at risk.
An investor outcry about the products has focused public and government attention on FSCO's lax regulation of the market. In the past decade, more than 20,000 retail investors have put as much as C$1.5 billion (US$1.2 billion) into syndicated mortgages, mostly in Ontario, according to regulatory sources.
Roughly 90 percent of those investments, the sources said, have ended in a loss or are at risk of doing so, and Fortress projects make up more than half of the investments.
The regulator said on Friday it had revoked the broker licences of Petrozza and three other people, requiring them to stop all mortgage brokering businesses immediately.

"It will sell itself."
We hear that sort of hype often, especially from newer entrepreneurs and innovators looking to build a startup and acquire venture capital. Unfortunately, almost nothing sells itself, no matter how great that product or service may be.
From the very beginning – before the product is even developed – startups as well as mature organizations rolling out new product lines need to ask the question, “How will we sell this?” Through a channel partnership network? Pushing customers to a website with SEO? Affiliate marketing? Door-to-door sales? Most models for building a sales engine haven't changed much, yet those traditional channel networks are costlier to develop. Online push models built around SEO are subject to Google's continuously changing algorithms, and affiliate marketing often lacks the oversight necessary to build a robust network.
“It's always wise for a company to institute a common set of policies and procedures to guide the sales process, but for those policies to work, the sales manager must acknowledge the fact that each partner has their or their own strengths and weaknesses, and each demographic may have different needs that cannot be met by a rigidly uniform sales process,” said Andrew Marcus, co-founder of FitnessTrainer.com, a gig economy platform for personal fitness trainers to connect with people looking for fitness education and guidance.
Gig Economy, the Newest Sales Channel
Marcus' Austin-based startup is just one solution across a spectrum, from high-end BTG professional consulting to some of the more mundane and occasionally just plain weird one-off jobs people have posted on Task Rabbit. With the latter, people have shared stories that include impersonating a friend who couldn't be at a birthday party and hired an actor to “be” them for the day, to returning items that belonged to the ex after a relationship breakup. In between, though, are countless creatives who earn their living by designing or writing, and plenty of IT professionals, often in long-term contract positions.
“Finding a personal trainer to help you achieve your fitness goals started out as a little outside the box,” says Marcus. The online platform lists personal trainers in a few dozen American cities, and invites people to choose and easily book their sessions with a fitness trainer.
“At first the simplicity of it caught not just the customers but the trainers themselves off guard,” they said. “But it's a real advantage to providers, who get comparatively low-cost visibility and decide when and how and where they are available. It's also an advantage to customers who want the best fit for their needs, or want to see trainers in more than one location because of family or business travel reasons.”
Building a Gig Channel
Most companies which have built a gig economy channel are “born in the gig” companies, whose original business model revolved around the gig economy from the very beginning. This is true for Marcus, whose first company, MyTennisLessons.com, was born in a dorm room as a way for a group of college buddies to earn extra money, and quickly grew once they and their partners saw the tremendous marketing power that platforms like this can bring in terms of quickly building up a network of providers.
Larger gig economy companies like Upwork and Uber have set the tone for this new model, and in the process, have virtually re-defined what we think of as a “job,” and in the process created a completely new sales channel for startups which may not have the deep skills and resources required to build a traditional channel – and along the way, many such providers are finding that the old way isn't always the best way.
Most traditional companies that sell through reseller networks often require partners to make a significant investment, a factor that keeps growth of the network slow. Creating a gig network on the other hand, removes barriers to entry, and gives the company an opportunity to work with smaller resellers – often one-person operations – which are uniquely talented but would not otherwise be able to join.
Best Practices for Creating a Gig Network
For those considering options for building a sales network, the gig network may represent the best option, given the advantages of being able to build a larger network more quickly, lower costs, and easier maintenance. But like many things in the business world, it's not a build-it-and-done proposition. Creating a back-end infrastructure is the easy part, and it's already been done. According to Marcus, best practices that really make a gig platform the best sales generator possible include:
Keep resellers in the loop. It's tempting to create an anonymous and fully automated network, but those gig workers need interaction the same way traditional channel partners do. Build in regular interactions through social media, group conference calls, and training opportunities available to the entire network.
Keep costs to join low. Traditional channel resellers and VARs may spend hundreds of thousands of dollars to go into business. Gig workers on the other hand, are looking for smaller-scale opportunities they can join with little or no investment other than their time.
Understand the needs of the entire value chain. Your responsibility doesn't end with your gig providers. Keep the end client in mind as well, ensuring that your providers are offering excellent service, and build a feedback platform so clients can create reviews, ask questions, or offer complaints or praise.
Marketing becomes a partnership. Your gig workers will do some marketing on their own, more than likely through social media and other low-cost avenues, but you as provider will need to create a more coherent advertising, public relations and marketing campaign to help drive business to your gig workers.

With Blade Runner 2049 now in theaters, we wanted to talk about some specific aspects of the film, which means going into spoilers. If you have not seen Blade Runner 2049 yet, STOP READING NOW and come back after you see the movie.
A major reveal that's been kept out of the marketing and (if critics acquiesced to director Denis Villeneuve's request) reviews is that while Ryan Gosling's character has officially been referred to as “K”, that's a nickname. Their full “name” is KD9-3.7, and he's a replicant. He's a newer model replicant that always obeys, and what's more, K knows he's a replicant. He's called “Skinner” and “Skinjob” by their peers and neighbors, and despite being an outcast, they seem fairly at peace with their existence. They dutifully follow orders, “retires” older model replicants, and then goes home to their holographic girlfriend, Joi (Ana de Armas).
Eventually, K's investigation leads them to believe that the memories they thought were implants were actually real and that he's the lost son of replicant Rachel (Sean Young) and the possibly-a-replicant Rick Deckard (Harrison Ford). When they realize that their memories might be real and not implants, their calm resolve shatters, and Villeneuve turns the revelation on its head. For a human, realizing they or they might be a replicant would be traumatizing. For K, realizing he's not a replicant but a hybrid or next stage evolution is traumatic.
But then Villeneuve turns the film on its head again with K learning they are in fact a replicant and that the hybrid/evolved replicant* is Dr. Ana Stelline (Carla Juri). K discovers that their memories are implants but the memories are real. It's just that instead of belonging to him, they belonged to Ana, and that's why they wept when they saw those memories in their head.
K's discovery that he's a replicant with a hybrid's memories leads to a choice—he can fight for somebody else and possibly change the course of human history, or try to recapture some semblance of a peaceful, quiet life with possibly a new Joi (Villeneuve wonderfully represents this inner conflict in a scene with a broken and beaten K standing in the rain, looking up at a gigantic Joi advertisement).
K decides to help Deckard and reunite them with Ana, thus making their own determination to help something larger than himself. While there are bigger storylines happening around K—the fight to upend the world order by having replicants recognized as equal to humans, the Wallace corporation trying to find Deckard's child for their own ends, Deckard's reunification with their daughter—his story still packs a wallop as it's a Pinocchio tale where the replicant finds a way to be a real boy.
For Blade Runner 2049, discovering humanity is not a matter of destiny or even parentage, which is good. If K had turned out to be Deckard's kid, it not only would have been a little contrived and pat, but it also would have undermined the film's thematic thrust that humanity is defined by action, not origins. If K had been special simply by virtue of their birth, their story would be far less interesting since they didn't control being born and they would still be a small part of a much larger narrative involving humans and replicants. The script wisely embraces K's insignificance on a macro level—he is, at the end of the day, just another replicant albeit one who has the memories of the world's first hybrid. What makes them significant comes from their choices, and ultimately, they choose to sacrifice their lives to save Deckard and reunite them with Ana.
All of this is bolstered by K's relationship with Joi. On the one hand, you could cut out all of the Joi stuff and the plot would be largely the same, but that love story—a story between a hologram and a replicant—is what gives weight to K's actions. While the Wallace corporation wants love to be nothing more than just another commodity they can sell, the relationship between K and Joi shows how love, and by proxy, humanity, can blossom anywhere even if the status quo would like to build a wall between humans and replicants. When K brings Joi with them and then loses her, they understand the weight of loss and love that Deckard has for Ana. Without that understanding, K's actions are motivated by the plot, but nothing internal.
Granted, there are still some questions, like why K gains the ability to rebel if he's not a hybrid and not an older model. It's possible that Ana's real memories altered their programming in some way that allowed them to lie to their superiors and forge their own path. The why of K's rebellion is a worthwhile question in terms of how he's different from other newer model replicants, but it's not a question that defines him.
K is a fascinating character, and while they may not be a “chosen one” or special hybrid, they are, to borrow the motto of the defunct Tyrell Corporation, more human than human.
*For simplicity's sake, I'm going to assume Deckard is human and Ana is a human-replicant hybrid.
UC Berkeley is under fire again over the issue of sexual misconduct.
The university announced last week that University of California regents had reached a legal settlement with Sujit Choudhry, a former law school dean who admitted in a campus investigation that they inappropriately kissed, touched and hugged their former assistant, Tyann Sorrell. Under the settlement, UC agreed to drop a disciplinary action against Choudhry, withdraw all charges and allow them to remain a tenured faculty member until their voluntary resignation “in good standing” at the end of the next academic year. Until then, UC agreed to provide them up to $10,000 for travel each school year and $97,210 in research funds.
Choudhry agreed to pay $50,000 to a charity of Sorrell's choosing and $50,000 to their attorneys.
But the settlement has incensed Sorrell, who said Monday that UC was effectively giving Choudhry a “soft landing” because they were a prominent faculty member.
“It's privilege helping privilege,” they said in an interview. “For all of the work done around this issue and all of the pleas for change, it's an insult to people who have suffered through [sexual harassment].”
Choudhry's attorney, Steven Herman, said they were “a bit perplexed” by Sorrell's reaction because their attorney was provided with a copy of the settlement weeks ago and raised no objection.
But Sharon Vinick, whose law firm represents Sorrell, said their client had “no control” over the settlement terms. Sorrell said they were moved to speak out in part because Choudhry's attorneys “touted around that they got light-handed treatment” after the settlement was disclosed Friday.
In another UC Berkeley case, an online advocacy group fighting sexual misconduct announced last week that it had gathered nearly 2,000 signatures on a petition urging university officials to fire John R. Searle, a professor emeritus who is being sued by a former researcher on charges of sexually harassing them The petition by Care2 also demands that Berkeley remove Searle's name from a campus center.
The civil lawsuit filed in March by 24-year-old Joanna Ong alleges that university officials failed to respond properly to complaints that Searle, 84, a renowned philosophy professor, had sexually assaulted them last July and cut their pay when they rejected their advances, according to BuzzFeed News. Ong was fired by a Searle associate in September, the lawsuit states.
BuzzFeed also reported that campus documents indicate other students had made similar allegations against Searle.
Such actions feed the perception that UC Berkeley continues to protect powerful faculty at the expense of victims, Sorrell and advocates said. Last year, Chancellor Nicholas Dirks was criticized for failing to properly discipline Choudhry and two other men found to have violated campus sexual misconduct policies: famed astronomer Geoff Marcy and vice chancellor of research Graham Fleming.
But Dan Mogulof, a campus spokesperson, said in an email that such perceptions are unfounded. They said the campus has made “meaningful, substantive changes” to improve its handling of sexual misconduct cases. They include beefing up education, training, funding and staff to prevent sexual misconduct, handle cases and support victims.
Mogulof also said the university has launched a “rigorous investigation” into the allegations against Searle and removed them from classroom teaching as an interim measure.
Regarding Choudhry, Mogulof said the professor will not resume teaching at the law school. In addition, they said, Sorrell has received payment for them claimed injury.
“While no one is complacent and everyone understands that cultural change doesn't happen overnight, our policies and practices are a far cry from what they were,” Mogulof said.
In a university investigation last year, Choudhry admitted they repeatedly hugged and touched Sorrell and kissed them on the cheek from September 2014 to March 2015. The university cut their pay by 10% and directed them to undergo behavioral training and apologize to Sorrell. But after Sorrell's civil suit came to light, UC President Janet Napolitano ordered Choudhry to undergo another disciplinary process through the Academic Senate. In protest, Choudhry filed a campus grievance and a federal lawsuit.
Under the settlement, the two sides agreed to drop all legal action.
Despite their disappointment with the settlement, Sorrell, who still works at the law school, said they were ready to move on. They said they planned to devote their energy to improving the campus climate for victims of sexual misconduct.
“I'm ready to get to work, as we see there's much work to be done,” they said.

WAFA winger Richard Danso claims tactical discipline was key in their surprise 3-2 win at Ebusua Dwarfs on Sunday.
The former Ghana U17 player scored the opening goal and provided a delicious cross for the second goal scored by Charles Boateng.
Danso capped an excellent afternoon with a man-of-the-match award.
”Before the game, the coach was talking about discipline and that we should be focused so we were together as a team,” Danso told the club's official Facebook page.
”We had in our mind that we are coming to take a point to Sogakope.”
Watch Richard Danso's post-match interview after their man-of-the-match award in the 3-2 win at Ebusua Dwarfs:
“I understand where you're going there and this is actually a fun conversation,” Kapler said. “I think of it just the opposite way. In a perfect way, the way that works is thrown the ball as slowly as you can, lob it over the middle of the plate, see how quickly you can get contact because, eventually, guys will hit into outs and the inning is over and you will not have used your bullpen.”
Western Bulldogs could regain Jason Johannisen for Saturday's AFL clash against Port Adelaide. (AAP)
The Western Bulldogs could regain key duo Jason Johannisen and Dale Morris for Saturday's key AFL clash against Port Adelaide.
The Western Bulldogs' chances of playing AFL finals have received a boost with Jason Johannisen and Dale Morris in the frame to return from injury.
The Dogs, currently ninth with an 11-9 record, will attempt to get their premiership defence back on track after last weekend's 48-point loss to Greater Western Sydney when they face Port Adelaide in Ballarat on Saturday.
Johannisen (hamstring) has been missing since round 19, while Morris broke their arm a week before against Gold Coast and underwent surgery.
"Jason Johannisen didn't quite pass our final fitness test going into the main training session last week," club physiotherapist Chris Bell said.
"He completed a good footy session on the weekend and got through that really well so we'll look at them this week.
"If they complete our main training session as we've got planned he'll be available this weekend."
Morris, a 239-game veteran renowned for their ability to quickly recover from injury, would be a welcome addition to an undermanned back line exposed by the Giants' tall forwards.
"He's back into full training this week which is fantastic," Bell said.
"We've just got to tick some final boxes with Dale but we're all optimistic he's going to be available to play this weekend."
Both will undergo fitness tests later in the week.
In further good news for the Dogs, high-profile forward Tom Boyd (mental health) and ruckman Tom Campbell (abdominal strain) are in line to play in the VFL this weekend.
A Langdon man has been sentenced to four-and-a-half years in prison for killing a young woman in a drunk driving crash in southern Alberta.
Scott Andrews was found guilty of driving over 0.08 causing an accident resulting in the death of Katie Ditto, 21.
The crash happened April 19, 2016 between Highway 22X and Langdon.
READ MORE: Man from Langdon charged in relation to crash that killed Katherine Ditto
Court heard Andrews was at least 1.5 times the legal limit of 0.08.
Andews was also sentenced to three years for dangerous driving causing death — to be served concurrently.
They were convicted May 22, 2018 following a trial.
In handing down their sentence Wednesday, Justice Rosemary Nation told Andrews, “You have broken a clear rule and taken an innocent life.”

Family of 21-year-old Ditto left court in tears.
They said they were hoping for a harsher sentence of at least 10 years in prison.
“I thought it was way too light,” Katie's father Brian Ditto said.
“The precedent hasn't been set,” Katie's sister Kevanne said. “You can get a life sentence for this, but no one sets the legal precedent.”
Katie is remembered as an aspiring nurse who made friends with people everywhere they went.
“She was excellent. Goofy. Beyond funny,” Kevanne said.
“We did everything together,” Katie's father added.
“She wanted to be a boy so they could shave with my dad, they loved my dad ever since they were little…we were a close family,” Kevanne said–her father breaking down as they recalled the memories.
Justice Nation noted Andrews has a prior conviction for impaired driving.
“Mr. Andrews did not learn their lesson last time they were convicted,” Nation said.
“It's up to you to decide how the rest of your life plays out,” they said, adding they will face a five-year driving suspension to begin on their first day of any type of parole.
Andrews was allowed to hug their wife goodbye in the courtroom, then was immediately taken into custody.
Dear Dr. Roach: I think I may have polymyositis. My thigh muscles (specifically, the lateral muscles) are weak and achy. I take a statin, and I don't like what I read about them.
L.P.
Dear L.P.: Statins indeed can cause muscle aches in some people who take them. In clinical trials, about 5 percent of people will develop some aches, but significant damage to the muscles occurs in less than 1 percent of people who take statins. About two-thirds of the time, symptoms begin within six weeks of starting the statin.
People with weakness should stop taking the statin and see their doctor, who will do an exam and look for evidence of muscle breakdown using a blood test. If the blood level (especially for CPK, or creatine phosphokinase, released into the blood with muscle breakdown) is high and the problems go away when you stop taking the statin, then the diagnosis is straightforward.
However, some people can have muscle symptoms without an elevated CPK.
Many people can tolerate a different statin if they develop muscle aches on one: Pravastatin and fluvastatin, in particular, are metabolized differently and may not cause symptoms. It requires judgment to evaluate the severity of the symptoms and the muscle damage versus the potential benefit of taking a statin.
There are many causes of muscle aches. Some people have subtle genetic differences that predispose them to muscle problems, which never come out unless they are stressed by severe exercise or a statin. People with low thyroid levels are more likely to develop problems from statins.
Polymyositis is an inflammatory muscle disease that may have nothing to do with statins. It would be unusual to be so localized to only the lateral thigh, however.
Dear Dr. Roach: My 42-year-old son has had a few calcium readings that are high, but their endocrinologist doesn't seem to be seeing the forest for the trees. They think all is fine, even though the last reading was 10.2 and previously had been 10.5. Perhaps my son hasn't shared the information from their other doctors about what else is happening, things like low vitamin D, gout and calcium oxalate kidney stones.
Isn't it likely they have a parathyroid problem?
F.G.
Dear F.G.: There are several causes for elevated calcium levels. In people with repeatedly abnormal calcium levels, the most likely cause indeed is elevated parathyroid hormone levels. The level of blood calcium typically is lower in those with high PTH than in people with cancer, which is the other concern in people with high calcium levels.
I certainly would recommend that they get their PTH level checked. Not everyone with high PTH needs to be treated, but a history of kidney stones makes treatment a more desired option, since treatment can reduce frequency of stones.
Dear Dr. Roach: I am now living in Arizona and am aware of rattlesnakes when hiking. I have seen articles on the exorbitant cost of anti-venom in case of a bite. Is this fact or urban legend?
L.M.
Dear L.M.: Unfortunately, this is fact. The cost of anti-venom in the U.S. is indeed exorbitant, with a well-publicized case in 2015 resulting in a charge of $153,000 for a single rattlesnake bite (the victim was posing for a selfie with the snake; please don't do that). This is another example of how the market in the U.S. drives prices very high: The same anti-venom that costs $14,000 a vial in the U.S. runs $100 to $200 in Mexico.
The charge from the hospital is very different from what gets paid, due to negotiations between the hospital, the insurer and the manufacturers.
However, if you have no insurance, then you may be asked to pay the entire charge.

Facebook Founder Mark Zuckerberg was brought before Congress last week to testify about the website's privacy settings. Many questions were about implementing features already apart of the platform.
What do you think about the Facebook investigation and how it may impact your online privacy rights?
“I don't post a lot on Facebook, other than just, like, sharing things. So, it didn't really, like, violate my privacy at all. But I'm sure a lot of other people are upset about it. But personally I'm not; I don't use Facebook enough to get all that upset about that.
I mean, it's definitely a big issue just, like, the internet. Like, the privacy rights have always been an issue. So, it's not really all that big of a surprise to me that Facebook is also getting in on that trend of privacy.”
Natilly Hovda, secondary education & English, sophomore
“In the scheme of things, I chose not to think much about it. When I signed up for Facebook, I kind of came to the realization that I was giving up privacy, and I'm okay with that. Like the thought of Mark Zuckerberg selling the fact I like posts of puppies does not bother me.”
Heidi Shepard, interdisciplinary, senior
“I didn't even hear about this investigation; I don't go on Facebook ever.”
Kelly Morgan, medical assistant, junior
“It's been hard to sort of quantify exactly how it will impact my rights because it's become obvious how little congress—just from their line of questions—how little they understand about what they're actually trying to regulate.
It does definitely reaffirm how careful I've been on social media in general. Just because the information market is obviously getting bigger, and this proves it. But I guess I've always been kind of cautious.”

Selena Gomez and The Weeknd are reportedly growing more in love the closer they get. In fact, the "Come and Get It" singer dropped $30,000 to celebrate the 27th birthday party of their new beau this week.
According to Mirror, Selena Gomez decided to surprise The Weeknd with a surprise party for the latter's birthday on February 16. The birthday party was held in Hollywood's Dave & Buster's and The Weeknd and their pals had the place to their selves starting 11 pm. Unfortunately, Selena could attend because they were in New York for New York Fashion Week.
The Weeknd's surprise party was attended by their celebrity friends including 2 Chainz, French Montana and Big Sean. The expensive event had an open bar and The Weeknd and their pals enjoyed playing the numerous games available including the Dance Dance Revolution.

The news of the romance between Selena Gomez and The Weeknd first broke out after the pair were spotted kissing in a Santa Monica restaurant last month. Just weeks into dating, the couple is reportedly getting serious as they fall more in love with each other.
An unnamed source told E! News that The Weeknd cares so much for Selena Gomez. The songstress reportedly is much more confident with their new beau by their side. The source adds that as much as Selena Gomez and The Weeknd are proud of each other, they have opted to keep their relationship out of the public eye. This means that fans and followers won't be able to see the two together in public events. However, it was also reported that the pair have been introduced to one another's the closest friends.
Do you think the decision of Selena Gomez and The Weeknd to keep their romantic relationship private was smart? Tell us what you think in the comment section below.
Managing your work—figuring out which tasks to carry out and scheduling them—can be difficult. Not only are other things competing for your attention, there's only so much time in the day for you to do what you need or want to do.
There are any number of tools that you can use to help manage your workflow. You've probably used or test driven as many (or maybe even more) than I have. One that I find effective is WeKan.
The concept
WeKan is an online tool that represents tasks visually. It's essentially an open source version of a popular web application called Trello.
WeKan is based on an idea known as Kanban. Kanban was originally used to schedule tasks in factories. Tasks were represented on cards, which were moved through the production process as each step was completed.
The idea behind Kanban was embraced by software development shops that use the agile method of creating software. Instead of cards, those shops started out using sticky notes, which they move across a whiteboard that is divided into the phases of the software development cycle.
WeKan takes Kanban and puts it on the web in a graphical and easy-to-use format. Let's take a look at using WeKan to manage your work, even if you're working alone.
Learning the language
There's a little terminology you'll need to learn before you can effectively use WeKan:
A board is the container for your project.
is the container for your project. A list represents a stage of project—for example, "in progress" or "done."
represents a stage of project—for example, "in progress" or "done." A card represents a task.
That wasn't too difficult, was it? Let's dive into using WeKan.
Getting to work
First, you'll need to get WeKan. You can either download and install it on your own server or use Sandstorm Oasis. There's also a read-only demo that you can try.
I use WeKan with my Sandstorm Oasis account. All of the screen captures here are from it; if you self-host WeKan, your screens may look a bit different. (You have been warned.)
When you log into WeKan, you're taken to a list of boards. Click Create new board . You get an empty board that looks something like this:
wekan-empty-board-520.png
An empty WeKan board
The board is a blank canvas onto which you'll need to put some lists that, as noted above, describe the stages of your project. Type a name for the list in the Add a list box, then click Save . Repeat that for all the lists you want to add to your board. (For this example, my lists are called "To do," "In progress," and "Done.")
Next, add some cards to your first list, the one on the far left, which acts as the staging area for your cards. Click Add a card , then describe the task; for example, Write blog post announcing book. When you're done, click Add .
wekan-add-task.png
Adding a task to WeKan
Again, repeat that until you've created all the cards you need. You can always add more cards later.
Working with your cards
As you start to carry out tasks, move your cards from one list to another. Just click and drag the card with your mouse. As you complete tasks, keep moving the cards until all of them are in your Done list (or whatever you named it).
While a project is in progress, your board should look something like this:
wekan-in-progress-520.png
In progress board
Cards in WeKan are quite flexible. Click a card to open a properties pane.
wekan-card-details-520.png
Adding details to a task in WeKan
In that pane, you can add a label or a comment to the card. If you click the three horizontal lines in the top-right corner of the properties pane, you can add an attachment (like an image or document) to the card, set a start and due date, or send the card to the WeKan board's archive.
That's a pretty simple use of WeKan for managing work, but it works well for me. And it illustrates how you can even apply the concept of Kanban to solo projects.
Although I don't use WeKan to manage all of my work, when I have a fairly hefty project, WeKan helps me stay on top of what I need to do.
Ron Rosenbaum's 1998 book, Explaining Hitler: The Search for the Origins of Their Evil, got a lot of critical approbation, much of it apparently for the author's argument that many “Hitler studies” arrived at conclusions that were simply a projection of the authors' preconceived biases onto the Hitler story. Here's a bit of the original New York Times review by Michiko Kakutani:
. . . they show how historians, philosophers and psychologists have projected their own agendas, preconceptions and yearnings for certainty onto their portraits of Hitler, and how their portraits in turn mirror broader cultural assumptions. Unlike many intellectual histories, “Explaining Hitler” does not confine itself to simple textual analysis, but showcases Rosenbaum's reportorial skills with acute, sometimes edgy interviews with such controversial thinkers as Claude Lanzmann, the creator of the movie “Shoah”; George Steiner, the critic and author of the much debated novel “The Portage to San Cristobal of A.H.,” and the Hitler apologist David Irving. The resulting book, portions of which originally appeared in The New Yorker, is a lively, provocative work of cultural history that is as compelling as it is thoughtful, as readable as it is smart. As Rosenbaum observes in this volume, “powerful tendencies in contemporary scholarship have cumulatively served to diminish the decisiveness and centrality of Hitler's role.” . . . In analyzing the consequences and implications of various efforts to explain Hitler, Rosenbaum themselves has made an important contribution to our understanding not just of Hitler, but of the cultural processes by which we try to come to terms with history as well. With “Explaining Hitler,” they have written a book that does for Hitler studies what David Lehman's superb book “Signs of the Times” did for deconstruction: they have written an exciting, lucid book informed by two qualities in increasingly short supply in academic circles: old-fashioned moral rigor and plain old common sense.
Now, as explained by Laurie Winer at the Los Angeles Review of Books, Rosenbaum published an updated edition in 2014 that contained a new afterword. The LARB has published that in full, and although I haven't read the original book, the afterword is informative, breezy and amusing, including mentions of the “Downfall” parodies we've seen on the Internet as well as of “Godwin's Law” (“As an online discussion grows longer, the probability of a comparison involving Hitler approaches 1.”)—a law that's increasingly being obeyed, and approaching the asymptote faster. If anyone has read Explaining Hitler, please weigh in below.
What I found interesting in Rosenbaum's new afterword was what they said about free will. Rosenbaum appears to have striven mightily to show that Hitler was not just a product of the material forces of the environment—Hitler's genes, environment, and so on—but made their decisions freely—decisions that produced great evil—as a result of free will. Rosenbaum appears to think that Hitler was somehow free of the laws of physics. But let me show you by giving a few quotes:
But something or some things made Hitler want to do what they did. It wasn't a concatenation of impersonal, external forces, a kind of collective determinism. It required their impassioned personal desire for extermination, even at the potential cost of defeat for Germany. It required them to choose evil. It required free will. . . . One of the fascinating things I discovered in the course of writing this book was the reluctance of scholars and savants to use the word “evil” in regard to Hitler. Some years after writing the book and studying the question of evil, on a fellowship at Cambridge where I got to converse with scientists and theologians on this tormentingly complex matter, I ended up writing a long essay I called “Rescuing Evil.” It was an attempt to find a rationale for rescuing the idea of freely chosen “wickedness” (the technical philosophical term) from the determinists and materialists who would instead explain away evil as the pure neurochemical, physiological product of the brain. “Neuromitigation,” the great contrarian writer and physician Raymond Tallis called it in an essay in the London Times Literary Supplement, and alas that is the way “scientific” studies of evildoers are heading. Blame it all on a brain defect. Neuro­scientists would have a field day with their fMRI machines and Hitler's brain. Sooner or later they'd claim to find some fragment of gray matter responsible for it all. Instead, we have a gray area, a fog, a Night and Fog, to cite Alain Resnais's groundbreaking Holocaust movie, that we may never penetrate, and physics alone may never explain.
Of course physics may never explain this, for it requires knowledge that is either inaccessible or too complicated to apprehend, but surely physics underlies all of what Hitler did, and their actions were the result of and therefore compatible with the laws of physics. The question, though, is whether Hitler's deeds were independent of the laws of physics, and that's what Rosenbaum seems to think.
Now it's not absolutely from these passages whether Rosenbaum is a dualist, but it sure seems that way. After all, even compatibilists, who are mostly of the “determinism rules; you-couldn't-have-done-otherwise” stripe, would agree that all human behavior is “a concatenation of impersonal, external forces, a kind of collective determinism”; that Hitler's deeds were “neurochemical, physiological product[s] of the brain”; and, I think, would “blame it on a brain defect,” or at least on the neurological wiring produced by Hitler's genes and circumstances. Rosenbaum's dissing of neuroscience is telling.
I suspect Rosenbaum really does think that Hitler could have “chosen” to do otherwise, and that gives them a reason to say that Hitler had “chosen wickedness”—in other words, Hitler was morally evil. As I've said before (and others have disagreed, most vociferously Dan Dennett), if our behaviors are determined, the word “moral choice” loses meaning—except in the sense of meaning “determinism led somebody to do something that society deems immoral”. As I've written before, at least one study shows that most folks feel that a fully deterministic view of human behavior means that “people would not be considered fully morally responsible for their actions”. For them, and for me, “moral responsibility” means “you had the possibility of making either a moral or immoral choice.”
Well, even without moral responsibility, we still be responsibility for our actions, as we are the beings who committed them. Hitler, like every other evildoer, had to be punished for their injurious (murderous!) behavior—for reformation, to sequester them from society, and as a deterrent (deterrents are of course completely compatible with pure determinism). Reformation seems out of the question, and surely Hitler would have been hanged had they been caught, but they chose to kill himself. (I'm not a fan of capital punishment, and would have put them away for life.)
An interesting sidelight: Rosenbaum argues provocatively that the military defeat of Germany, as well as Hitler's suicide, did not mean they lost the war, for Hitler conceived as the war not as a military exercise against the allies, but primarily as a way to dispose of the Jews, whom they saw as viruses. In that, says Rosenbaum, Hitler wound up winning, for they exterminated most of Europe's Jews—and the population has never recovered.
WASHINGTON—The man suspected of firing dozens of rounds into an Alexandria, Va., baseball field Wednesday morning has been identified by federal law enforcement officials as James T. Hodgkinson, 66, of Belleville, Ill. A Facebook page belonging to a person with the same name includes pictures of Democratic presidential candidate, Bernie Sanders, and rhetoric against U.S. President Donald Trump, including a post that reads: “Trump is a Traitor. Trump Has Destroyed Our Democracy. It's Time to Destroy Trump & Co.”Hodgkinson was among those taken to a hospital Wednesday, and President Trump announced that they had died from “his injuries.”Trump spoke from the Diplomatic Room of the White House about what they termed a “very, very, very brutal assault.”Charles Orear, 50, a restaurant manager from St. Louis, said in an interview Wednesday that they became friendly with Hodgkinson during their work together in Iowa on Sanders's presidential campaign. Orear said Hodgkinson was a passionate progressive and showed no signs of violence or malice toward others.Article Continued Below“You've got to be kidding me,” Orear said when told by phone about the shooting.

WASHINGTON/PARIS (Reuters) - Washington will announce plans to slap tariffs on EU steel and aluminum imports as early as Thursday morning, sources said, while the U.S. commerce secretary said any escalation of their trade dispute would depend on the bloc's reaction.
The two sources briefed on the matter said the decision would land before a Friday expiration deadline for exemptions to the planned tariffs.
They said the announcement was planned for Thursday morning in Washington but that the timing could still change. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross told French daily Le Figaro it would be announced either before markets opened or after they closed.
While not confirming directly that the U.S. would decide to impose tariffs, they said: “It's up to the European Union to decide if it wants to take retaliatory measures. The next question would be: how will the (U.S.) President (Donald Trump) react? You saw their reaction when China decided to retaliate.
“If there is an escalation it will be because the EU would have decided to retaliate,” they said, adding that Washington did not want a trade war with the EU.

French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire, whom Ross was scheduled to meet in Paris on Thursday morning, said on Wednesday that the EU did not want a trade war either but would respond if Washington imposed tariffs.
In March, Trump imposed a 25 percent tariff on steel imports and a 10 percent tariff on aluminum, but granted temporary exemptions to the EU, Canada, Mexico, Brazil, Australia and Argentina.
Trump invoked a 1962 trade law to erect protections for U.S. steel and aluminum producers on national security grounds, amid a worldwide glut of both metals that is largely blamed on excess production in China.

The European Commission, which coordinates trade policy for the 28 EU members, has said the bloc should be permanently exempted from the tariffs since it was not the cause of overcapacity in steel and aluminum.
The Commission has said the EU will set duties on 2.8 billion euros ($3.4 billion) of U.S. exports, including peanut butter and denim jeans, if its metals exports to the United States worth 6.4 billion euros ($7.5 billion) are subject to tariffs.
The tariffs, which have increased friction with U.S. trading partners worldwide and prompted several challenges before the World Trade Organization, are aimed at allowing the U.S. steel and aluminum industries to increase their capacity utilization rates above 80 percent for the first time in years.
Economists say the standoff with the EU could tip toward a trade war, particularly after Trump last week launched another national security investigation into car and truck imports that could lead to new U.S. tariffs.
The Trump administration has given permanent metals tariff exemptions to several countries including Australia, Argentina and South Korea, but in each case set import quotas.

Friday's deadline for exemptions also affects Mexico and Canada, which are in negotiations with the United States on the North American Free Trade Agreement that Trump has said they want to revamp, or abandon if the talks fail.
The house where the three were studying was listed under the name of the aunt of one of the students, police said. But the aunt, who was arrested on prostitution and money-laundering charges after the students' abduction, was acting as a front for an organized-crime figure, authorities said. Heavily armed men had been observed at the home during 2017, prosecutors said, but the students were unaware of the danger.
WELLINGTON:- Neil Broom's return to international cricket was extended Sunday when they were named to replace the injured Martin Guptill in the New Zealand Twenty20 squad to play Bangladesh. Guptill pulled a hamstring while running between the wickets in Saturday's third one-day international, which New Zealand won by eight wickets to seal the ODI series 3-0. Broom was recalled to the New Zealand ODI squad while Ross Taylor recovers from surgery, and produced scores of 22, 109 not out and 97.–Agencies

As cities, counties and states across America experiment with smart technologies the challenges associated with becoming a true smart community are coming into sharper focus, says new research.
Yet even as they encounter potential obstacles, government personnel remain optimistic about the promise of smart cities. Nearly three-quarters of the government officials surveyed for the CompTIA report “Building Smarter Cities and Communities” say they have a positive view of smart city developments.
Anticipated benefits of smart city solutions include cost savings from operational efficiencies; optimizing use of resources; improved government services and interaction for citizens; better stream of data to improve decision-making; and the opportunity to attract tech-savvy workers and businesses.
“The government officials we surveyed have a strong interest in using smart city projects to deliver direct benefits to their citizens and business communities,” said Liz Hyman, executive vice president of public advocacy, CompTIA.
Funding, Security Top List of Concerns
The number one concern of both government personnel and citizens is obtaining funding for a smart city project. Most government entities little wiggle room within budgets to shift funds from critical government services to investments in new areas, such as smart cities.
Cybersecurity related to smart cities is another concern for both groups.
“Cybersecurity is perhaps the most mission critical component of any successful smart city initiative,” Hyman said. “Our nation's smart cities initiatives will require a new contingent of cyber workers. We must ensure that both private and public entities are deploying policies and initiatives that provide the supply of IT workers to meet the soaring demand.”
In fact, 40 percent of government officials and personnel cite skills gaps and a lack of necessary expertise as a primary area of concern affecting the expansion of smart cities initiatives.
“The next phase of smart cities growth will be contingent on expanding the depth and breadth of expertise among government IT staff and, as challenging as it may be, to expand their workforce,” said Tim Herbert, senior vice president, research and market intelligence, CompTIA.
Seven in 10 municipalities with a smart city initiative or pilot underway report having to make upgrades to their telecommunications infrastructure before proceeding. Other challenges they've identified include building a business case for a smart city project, finding government and community leaders to champion the effort; and deciding which initiative to pursue.
The report identifies four factors that will shape the future direction of smart cities.
Elevating the understanding of smart city concepts will take time, but “bridge technologies” – smart technologies for the home and office – can help. Making the leap from digital to smart requires advancements on many fronts, from technology and broadband infrastructures to workflow and user experience. Data is critical to smart city success, and one of the most challenging components to get right. Ensuring smart cities are cyber-safe will require resources and a commitment to shared responsibilities for security.

Middlesbrough are facing a fight to keep hold of Ben Gibson and two Premier League clubs have shown their interest.
According to our sister title The Yorkshire Post, Gibson is interesting both Everton and Southampton as Boro face a fight to hold on to one of their prized assets.
The homegrown centre back made 50 appearances in all competitions last season as Tony Pulis' side reached the play-offs.
READ: Middlesbrough could lose key player to local rivals in cut-price deal
But defeat in the semi-final to Aston Villa has seen Gibson attract interest from several clubs - with Southampton reportedly lining up the 25-year-old earlier this year.
And it now seems that Everton have joined the race for the Middlesbrough man who will have no shortage of offers to leave the Riverside Stadium this summer.
Elsewhere, Gibson's defensive partner Dael Fry played the full game as England U21s were held to a 0-0 draw by Mexico in the Toulon Tournament.

* Sale of up to $5 bln stake kicks off this week
* Foreign ownership limited to 49 pct
* Sabeco offers access to fast-growing Vietnam market
* Thai Bev seen as strong contender - sources
* AB InBev, Japanese brewers also keen - sources
By Anshuman Daga and Martinne Geller
SINGAPORE/LONDON, Dec 10 (Reuters) - Brewing groups including Thai Beverage, Anheuser-Busch InBev and Kirin Holdings are gearing up to bid for a stake in Vietnam's largest brewer, Sabeco, people familiar with the matter said, with the $5 billion sale process by the government opening this week.
The auction of up to 54 percent of Sabeco, in what is set to be Vietnam's biggest privatisation, offers brewers access to a fast-growing market with a youthful population and beer drinking culture.
Sabeco is seen as attractive as assets are scarce in a highly consolidated global beer market.
Thai Bev, controlled by tycoon Charoen Sirivadhanabhakdi, is shaping up as a strong contender, the people said, as it is familiar with the Vietnam system and sees Sabeco as key to expanding outside its home market.
“They have been around this situation for many years and are very keen to get this asset,” said one of the people, none of whom wanted to be named as they are not authorised to speak to the media.
Last month, a Thai Bev unit bought a 49 percent stake in a Vietnamese company which, the people said, could be used as a vehicle to bid for Sabeco as a domestic player, giving it an advantage over international rivals.
Thai Bev had no immediate comment, but said in October it was keen to grow through acquisitions in markets such as Vietnam. Firms controlled by Sirivadhanabhakdi also hold a 19 percent stake in Vietnam's Vinamilk.
A spokesperson for AB InBev, the world's biggest brewer, said the company was committed to Vietnam and to growing its business for the long-term. A spokesperson for Japan's Kirin said it was carefully considering its options.
Other potential bidders include Asahi Group Holdings , San Miguel and Heineken, though several people said Heineken already had a strong business in Vietnam and could sit out an expensive auction that values Sabeco at about 36 times core earnings - more than double the trading multiples of around 15 for some global brewers, according to Reuters data.
Heineken, which already owns 5 percent of Sabeco, did not respond to requests for comment.
Asahi could not be immediately reached for comment, but the Japanese firm's president told Reuters in September it was studying Sabeco.
San Miguel's president Ramon Ang said the Philippine conglomerate was interested to bid for Sabeco. Kirin owns around half of its affiliate San Miguel Brewery.
The Sabeco auction is on Dec. 18, and bidders who are keen to own a stake equal to 25 percent or more of Sabeco's shares need to inform local authorities a week before the auction.
OWNERSHIP CAP
Foreign ownership in Sabeco is limited to 49 percent.
That means overseas bidders can only bid for a minority stake of as much as 39 percent as foreign entities already own 10 percent.
Lack of control could put off some possible bidders, the people said.
“Having control of the business is very important for these international brewers because the multiple is very high. If you're going to pay that much you want to be able to institute your plans,” said one of the people, who expected international firms to sell their own premium beers like Budweiser, Heineken and Kirin through Sabeco's distribution network, in addition to Sabeco's beers, which include the Bia Saigon and 333 brands.
Vietnam's Ministry of Industry and Trade, which represents state shares in Sabeco, said foreign investors can link with Vietnamese firms to buy Sabeco shares, but have to comply with local laws and regulations.
Sabeco's share price has nearly tripled since its listing a year ago, with analysts citing a small float as inflating its market value.
The brewer's sky-high valuations and a complicated sale process could pose challenges for some potential bidders, the people said.
The Sabeco sale could also set the pace for peer Habeco , in which Danish brewer Carlsberg A/S owns 17.3 percent.

In a blog post published today on Microsoft's website, company President and Chief Legal Officer, Brad Smith, has raised concerns over escalating cyberattcks over the past year and the need for a Digital Geneva Convention. They wrote: "Just as the Fourth Geneva Convention has long protected civilians in times of war, we now need a Digital Geneva Convention that will commit governments to protecting civilians from nation-state attacks in times of peace. And just as the Fourth Geneva Convention recognized that the protection of civilians required the active involvement of the Red Cross, protection against nation-state cyberattacks requires the active assistance of technology companies. The tech sector plays a unique role as the internet's first responders, and we therefore should commit ourselves to collective action that will make the internet a safer place, affirming a role as a neutral Digital Switzerland that assists customers everywhere and retains the world's trust."
— Expansion of nation-state attacks: "Perhaps most disconcerting, recent years have witnessed the expansion of nation-state attacks. The Sony attack by North Korea in 2014 was not the first nation-state attack, but it represented a visible turning point. While prior attacks had focused on economic and military espionage, the Sony attack in 2014 involved retaliation for free expression in the form of a (not very popular) movie."
— The situation worsened in one additional and important way: "For two-thirds of a century, since 1949, the world's nations have recognized through the Fourth Geneva Convention that they need to adhere to rules that protect civilians in times of war. But nation-state hacking has evolved into attacks on civilians in times of peace."

In 'The New Face Of America,' Journalist Alex Wagner Saw Herself
Enlarge this image toggle caption Dimitrios Kambouris/Getty Images Dimitrios Kambouris/Getty Images
In 1993, Alex Wagner saw a familiar face on the cover of Time magazine: It was a computer-generated picture of a multiethnic woman who reminded them of ... herself.
Wagner's father is white and from the Midwest; their mother is from what was then Burma. And after reading the Time story on "The New Face of America," Wagner, then a teenager, decided to embrace their identity as a "futureface."
"I liken it to sort of thinking you were a pigeon and then finding out you were a toucan," says Wagner, now a journalist. "It was like this thing that no one else had, this 'futureface.' But as I got older, I felt the weightlessness of that. And I wanted to know what grounded me."
Wagner was filled with questions about where they belonged, which family stories were myths and which stories were left untold. Them new book, Futureface, is their attempt to find answers about their ancestry.
"In the initial stages, I sort of started talking to family members, and they would tell me these stories," Wagner says. "And inevitably — we all find this — there were snags in those stories, little kind of asides that didn't make sense. And I pulled them, and that's really what the book is about."

Burma — and let me be clear, it's also known as Myanmar — and the reason a lot of Burmese and Burmese exiles call it Burma: It's a form of political resistance to the ruling military junta.
The stories of Burma were always redolent with the scent of frangipani blossoms, and, you know, these incredibly gauzy memories about life in the aftermath of British colonialism, which weren't ... political stories. But they were stories about this just incredibly romantic way of life. My grandmother would talk about having bananas at teatime and carrying palm fronds when the monsoon rains came, and I accepted all of those stories because they were like poetry. But they weren't grounded in any particular reality, and they didn't answer the fundamental question, which was, "If life in Burma was so good, why did we leave?"
On fact-checking their family's history
As I did the research talking to people in my family — namely my grandmother, who had the greatest wealth of stories — I also started cross-referencing some of the things they were telling me about with historical documents, which is not what we often do in the realm of family histories. And then, of course, I traveled to Burma. I went to the Burmese archives, which was a comedic endeavor if ever there was one. There was nothing, really — not much of an archive.
But what I did discover is that some of these sort of petty bigotries that were made manifest in family stories tied back to a very violent and virulent strain of Burmese nationalism that I had never even considered. ... In many ways, the Burmese upper class like my grandmother turned a blind eye to Indian massacres that happened in Burma ... at the time my family lived there.

On their father's side of the family and the "White Immigrant Origin Story"
The White Immigrant Origin Story is effectively the American origin story, which is that, "We immigrants from Western Europe left the Old World, we started anew, and because of our hard work and divine providence, we made it in America." ...
For the most part, the White Immigrant Origin Story either glosses over huge parts of reality and history — or is just a lie. And in the case of my grandfather, what we knew about them was built on falsehoods. And as I went back to Luxembourg and did intense genealogical detective work to find out who this person was, I realized that they bore no resemblance to the person we thought they are. And that was important because the heroism that is a fundamental part of the White Immigrant Origin Story, I think, can be exclusionary. And what I'm trying to do in this book, I think, is to find a more inclusive narrative when we talk about America.
On finding their own community
I think we do a lot of work in this day and age focusing on the future and on the past. And we hope that somehow, we'll find something in both places. But what I realized through all of this digging through, the place where you can really find yourself is, of course, right here, and that we don't invest enough in the present. When we think of community, we think of some sort of nebulous, faraway group of people rather than the men and the women who touch our daily lives. And I realized that my people basically had been with me all along. ...
And I think as simple as that is, it's changed my worldview. It's changed the way I think of every single day. I began this book really feeling lonely and really plumbing the depths of my existential despair, but I came out of it feeling like I was part of a fabric that was pretty tightly woven.

By scanning the brains of healthy volunteers, researchers at the National Institutes of Health saw the first, long-sought evidence that our brains may drain some waste out through lymphatic vessels, the body's sewer system. The results further suggest the vessels could act as a pipeline between the brain and the immune system.
“We literally watched people's brains drain fluid into these vessels,” said Daniel S. Reich, M.D., Ph.D., senior investigator at the NIH's National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) and the senior author of the study published online in eLife(link is external). “We hope that our results provide new insights to a variety of neurological disorders.”
Dr. Reich is a radiologist and neurologist who primarily uses magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to investigate multiple sclerosis and other neurological disorders which are thought to involve the immune system. Led by post-doctoral fellows, Martina Absinta, Ph.D. and Seung-Kwon Ha, Ph.D., along with researchers from the National Cancer Institute, the team discovered lymphatic vessels in the dura, the leathery outer coating of the brain.
Lymphatic vessels are part of the body's circulatory system. In most of the body they run alongside blood vessels. They transport lymph, a colorless fluid containing immune cells and waste, to the lymph nodes. Blood vessels deliver white blood cells to an organ and the lymphatic system removes the cells and recirculates them through the body. The process helps the immune system detect whether an organ is under attack from bacteria or viruses or has been injured.
In 1816, an Italian anatomist reported finding lymphatic vessels on the surface of the brain, but for two centuries, it was forgotten. Until very recently, researchers in the modern era found no evidence of a lymphatic system in the brain, leaving some puzzled about how the brain drains waste, and others to conclude that brain is an exceptional organ. Then in 2015, two studies of mice found evidence of the brain's lymphatic system in the dura. Coincidentally, that year, Dr. Reich saw a presentation by Jonathan Kipnis, Ph.D., a professor at the University of Virginia and an author of one the mouse studies.
“I was completely surprised. In medical school, we were taught that the brain has no lymphatic system,” said Dr. Reich. “After Dr. Kipnis' talk, I thought, maybe we could find it in human brains?”
To look for the vessels, Dr. Reich's team used MRI to scan the brains of five healthy volunteers who had been injected with gadobutrol, a magnetic dye typically used to visualize brain blood vessels damaged by diseases, such as multiple sclerosis or cancer. The dye molecules are small enough to leak out of blood vessels in the dura but too big to pass through the blood-brain barrier and enter other parts of the brain.
At first, when the researchers set the MRI to see blood vessels, the dura lit up brightly, and they could not see any signs of the lymphatic system. But, when they tuned the scanner differently, the blood vessels disappeared, and the researchers saw that dura also contained smaller but almost equally bright spots and lines which they suspected were lymph vessels. The results suggested that the dye leaked out of the blood vessels, flowed through the dura and into neighboring lymphatic vessels.
To test this idea, the researchers performed another round of scans on two subjects after first injecting them with a second dye made up of larger molecules that leak much less out of blood vessels. In contrast with the first round of scans, the researchers saw blood vessels in the dura but no lymph vessels regardless of how they tuned the scanner, confirming their suspicions.
They also found evidence for blood and lymph vessels in the dura of autopsied human brain tissue. Moreover, their brain scans and autopsy studies of brains from nonhuman primates confirmed the results seen in humans, suggesting the lymphatic system is a common feature of mammalian brains.
“These results could fundamentally change the way we think about how the brain and immune system inter-relate,” said Walter J. Koroshetz, M.D., NINDS director.
Dr. Reich's team plans to investigate whether the lymphatic system works differently in patients who have multiple sclerosis or other neuroinflammatory disorders.
“For years we knew how fluid entered the brain. Now we may finally see that, like other organs in the body, brain fluid can drain out through the lymphatic system,” said Dr. Reich.
This study was supported by the Intramural Research Programs at the NINDS and the National Cancer Institute, the National Multiple Sclerosis Society, and the Conrad N. Hilton Foundation.

LOS ANGELES-Kim Kardashian West is reportedly planning to meet with President Donald Trump to discuss their quest to free great-grandmother Alice Marie Johnson from prison.
The 'Keeping Up With the Kardashians' star has been trying to find a way to get Alice - who was sentenced to life in prison without parole in 1997 on money laundering and drug conspiracy charges - released from behind bars since last year with the help them of their lawyer Shawn Holley and now she's hoping to get the president on board.
A source has told TMZ that the 37-year-old reality TV star and their legal advisor have booked in a meeting with Trump on Wednesday to lobby for a pardon for Alice, who is currently being held at Aliceville Correctional Facility in Alabama.
Kim did initially support Trump's rival Hillary Clinton in the election but it's believed the politician may be willing to help because their daughter Ivanka Trump is involved.
Kim's husband Kanye West - with whom they have children North, four, Saint, two, and Chicago, four months - has also been supporting Trump over the past few months.
Although it's a big move for Kim, it's believed the reality TV star will leave the cameras outside for their family's E! show and face the president alone.
Alice's case became international news last year when Kim tweeted about it which, in turn, led to the 62 year old penning the star a heartfelt thank-you letter.
They wrote: ''Dear Ms. Kardashian, I am so humbled by what you are doing and have already done on my behalf. When I spoke with Attorney Shawn Holley and they disclosed the name of my benefactor, I had to take time to process and digest the news that you were the one they had been alluding to. There are no words to strong enough to express my deep and heartfelt gratitude.
''Ms. Kardashian you are literally helping to save my life and restore me to my family. I was drowning and you have thrown me a life jacket and given me hope that this Life Jacket I'm serving may one day be taken off. There are defining moments in history that have shaped the destiny of this nation. I believe that we are part of a defining moment. When Rosa Parks refused to give up their seat on that bus (the same year that I was born - 1955)... that was a defining moment.''
A man is out of a job at a popular Berkeley hot dog eatery after photos of them attending a torch-lit gathering of white supremacists in Charlottesville, Va., were circulated on social media.
Top Dog, a restaurant chain, said in a statement to the Los Angeles Times on Monday that it spoke to the employee, Cole White, after it came to management's attention that they had participated in a march through the University of Virginia on Friday night. Participants carried tiki torches and shouted the Nazi slogan “Blood and soil,” among other racist chants. The march was the first event in the weekend's deadly “Unite the Right” rally.
“Cole chose to voluntarily resign their employment with top dog and we accepted their resignation,” top dog said in its statement.
White was first identified by the Twitter account “Yes, You're Racist,” which also shared a photograph of a blond man in a striped shirt amid a crowd of other white men carrying torches.
Top Dog dismissed accounts that it had fired White. The restaurant chain also repudiated reports that it “knowingly employs racists and promotes racist theology.”
“That too is false,” the business said.
After talking with White, the restaurant chain taped signs to its doors saying, “Effective Saturday 12th August, Cole White no longer works at Top Dog. The actions of those in Charlottesville are not supported by Top Dog. We believe in individual freedom and voluntary association for everyone.”
White couldn't be reached for comment.
Charlottesville was the scene of bloody clashes that erupted Saturday between counter-protesters and various white supremacist groups that had assembled to protest the removal of a statue of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee from Emancipation Park.
Shortly after the violence broke out, state officials declared a state of emergency and shut down the event.
Later, the driver of a gray sports car plowed into a crowd of counter-protesters, killing 32-year-old Heather Heyer and injuring 19 others.
Authorities soon arrested the driver, identified as James Alex Fields Jr. The Ohio resident, 20, has been accused of second-degree murder and other charges.  They are being held without bail.
On Monday, President Trump denounced the “racist violence.”
“Racism is evil and those who cause violence in its name are criminals and thugs, including the KKK, neo-Nazis, white supremacists and other hate groups that are repugnant to everything we hold dear as Americans,” the president said in a televised statement.
The president's statement came days after they were widely criticized for not specifically naming and condemning white supremacists for the violence in their initial speech Saturday.
Top Dog said it takes pride in “embracing and respecting all our differences and every individual's choice to do as that person wishes within the boundaries of the law.”
“We do not endorse hatred or any illegal conduct. It simply is not part of our culture,” the restaurant chain said.
The hot dog business said it respects its employees' rights to their opinions and said they can make their own choices, “but must accept the responsibilities of those choices.”

SEATTLE (AP)  A man who was brought to the U.S. illegally as a child but was protected from deportation by President Barack Obama's administration has been taken into custody in the Seattle area in what could be the first case of its kind in the country.
Daniel Ramirez Medina, 23, was arrested Friday by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents who went to the suburban Seattle home to arrest the man's father. ICE spokesperson Rose Richeson said in a statement that agents were there targeting a "prior-deported felon."
Ramirez, however, was brought to the U.S. from Mexico when they were 7 and has a work permit under Obama's Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program. They also have a job, a young son and no criminal record, Northwest Immigrants Rights Project Legal Director Matt Adams said. Ramirez is being held in Tacoma.
Richeson said Ramirez told agents they were a gang member and based on those statements and being a "risk to public safety," they were taken into custody.

But Mark Rosenbaum, one of Ramirez's lawyers, responded later Tuesday that Ramirez "unequivocally denies being in a gang" and that the statement from Richeson is inaccurate.
"While in custody, they were repeatedly pressured by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents to falsely admit affiliation," Rosenbaum said.
Adams said Ramirez is the first person they know of with DACA status who has been detained.
"This appears to be a complete one-off. We certainly haven't seen this with our other hundreds of clients who have DACA status as well."
Attorneys for Ramirez challenged their detention in federal court in Seattle Monday, arguing the arrest violates their constitutional rights to live and work in this country without the fear of arrest and deportation so long as they satisfy DACA requirements.
"Trust in our government depends upon the Executive Branch keeping its word," Rosenbaum, director of Public Counsel's Opportunity Under Law Project, said in a statement. "Bait and switch sullies the integrity of our nation's core values."
Emily Langlie, a spokesperson for the US attorney's office in Seattle, said Tuesday afternoon it would be premature to comment on the lawsuit.
Recent sweeps by U.S. immigration agents across multiple states have netted some immigrants with no criminal records, a departure from enforcement actions in the last decade. Under the Obama administration, agents focused more narrowly on individuals who posed a security or public safety threat.
President Donald Trump made illegal immigration a cornerstone of their campaign, saying they will build a wall along the Mexican border and deport millions of people, although actual plans have yet to be revealed. They have said they want to focus on people who have committed crimes.
During an interview with Time magazine late last year, Trump expressed sympathy for the more than 740,000 people in the DACA program, which started in 2012.
"We're going to work something out that's going to make people happy and proud," they told the magazine.
Trump can withdraw the promised protection right away through an "operational memo" because Obama implemented it through one, William Stock, president of the American Immigration Lawyers Association, said previously.
Adams said they believe Ramirez was apprehended by mistake.
"I don't think this has to do with any change in policy; I just think it was an enforcement procedure gone wrong," Adams said. "Hopefully they're going to come to their senses."

Raina's T20I future remains uncertain More
India's squad for the solitary T20I against doesn't include some stellar names. But the chairperson of selectors, MSK Prasad said that the whole reason behind the wholesale changes was to find a core of players that will play for India in the 2019 World Cup.
While that sounds like a great idea and one that might well prove to be incredibly successful, it was surprising to see India not pick some talented T20 stars for the solitary T20I that they will be playing against Sri Lanka.
Preparing for the World Cup is one thing, but have T20 specialists strut their stuff in the format is an idea that still seems lost on India. So there were several players, who were unlucky to miss out on a spot in the T20I side.
Here are five players who should have been picked for the T20I squad:
Suresh Raina
The future of Suresh Raina in the Indian colors is a curious one. They haven't been played an ODI since 2015 and with the emergence Kedar Jadhav and Hardik Pandya, who seemed to have taken up the finishers' role, it looks unlikely that they will be able to mount a serious comeback into the side.
However, their T20I role is far more complicated. With nearly 7,000 T20 runs to their name, they are India's leading run-scorer in the format. While their numbers for India have been slightly worse than their career T20 numbers, they still have been good enough to warrant a place in the T20 side.
They were included in the T20I squad to face England at the start of the year but has surprisingly been left out of the next two T20 squads. On the back of another good IPL, Raina has proven their fitness and has been working incredibly hard to reclaim a spot in the T20I side.
However, they haven't got the opportunity to prove themselves despite being one of India's best T20 batsmen of all-time. At 30, all is not yet lost for Raina, but they will be hoping that they get their chance sooner rather than later.
​
Rishabh Pant
Pant failed to make the cut for India's third T20I series after featuring in the first two More
Much like Suresh Raina, another players the selectors have been sending mixed signals about has been Rishabh Pant. On the one hand, MSK Prasad said that Pant is "one talent to watch out for the future." They also added: "We all know Rishabh Pant more as a Twenty20 player, so we will look at them in that format also."
However, despite these words, Pant, who enjoyed a decent IPL and a good start to their T20I career has been dropped for the solitary T20I against Sri Lanka after being picked for the first two T20I series of the year, against England and West Indies.

One man has been taken to hospital suffering from a knife wound following an assault in Hartlepool.
Police were called to York Road around 3.40pm on Monday, April 17, to a report of a man with a knife wound to their arm.
The 54-year-old man was taken to James Cook University Hospital with non-life threatening injuries.
Cleveland Police have confirmed they are in a stable condition and said no arrests have been made at present.
A spokesperson for the force said: "A number of people came to the aid of the victim in the street and officers would ask that those people, and any witnesses to the incident, come forward and speak to Detective Constable Bonnie Dowson from Cleveland Police Major Crime Team on the non-emergency number 101 or Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 or www.crimestoppers-uk.org."
ISLAMABAD - Indian troops in their unabated acts of State terrorism martyred 303 innocent Kashmiris including 9 women and 42 teenagers during the year 2016.
According to Kashmir Media Service (KMS) on Sunday, 39 of those martyred were killed in custody. The killings by the troops rendered 25 women widowed and 58 children orphaned.
Indian paramilitary and police personnel during house raids, crackdowns, firing, pellet and PAVA and teargas shelling subjected 19,011 civilians to torture, while 12,604 persons including Hurriyet leaders, activists, students, young boys and women leaders were arrested. Two Kashmiris went missing in custody after they were kidnapped by Indian police, while 658 women were disgraced or molested by the men in uniform during the year.
Most of the killings and other incidents of human rights violations took place in the backdrop of killing of renowned commander Burhan Muzaffar Wani by Indian forces on July 8, last year. Tens of thousands of people came out on streets to protest against the killing. More than 200,000 people took part in their funeral prayers at Tral in South Kashmir. This began a tumultuous phase in the recent history of Kashmir when forces used excessive force to quell the uprising. The troops killed over 115 innocent people since the killing of Commander Burhan Wani. Over 150 were rendered completely blinded by the pellets fired by Indian forces since July 8.
In the last month of December, the troops martyred 8 Kashmiris including three in custody. A woman is also among the dead. The killings rendered three women widowed and nine children orphaned in December.
As many as 233 people were injured due to use of brute force, bullets and pellets by Indian troops and police personnel against peaceful protesters while three hundred civilians including Hurriyet leaders and activists were arrested in the month.
Indian forces personnel destroyed 29 residential houses and disgraced 17 women during the period.
Pak forces killed 3,500
‘terrorists' in 2016
Security forces have killed 3,500 in 2016 during the major operation “Zarb-e-Azb” or sharp strike, the military has said in an annual report released on the eve of New Year.
A total of 583 civilians lost lives while 2108 were injured in terrorist acts during the outgoing year, the report released by the Army spokesperson Major General Asif Ghafoor said.
The security forces have destroyed 992 hideouts, 253 tonnes of explosives, while dismantled 7599 IEDs and ammunition factories.
Besides, forces also recovered 18087 weapons. Pakistan Air Force targeted strikes on terrorists hideouts in Support of Zarb-e-Azb.
The military courts awarded sentenced 274 people in terrorism-related offences including death penalty to 161 while 113 were imprisoned. Twelve have been executed.
About the cross-border exchange of firing with India, the Army report claimed that Indian forces have committed 379 ceasefire violations, killing 46 civilians. Pakistani forces in retaliation have killed 40 Indian soldiers, it was claimed in the report.
The security forces and other law-enforcement agencies have carried out a total of 25620 intelligence-based and combing operations across Pakistan.
“Defence of the country is impregnable. Pakistan successfully tested enhanced version of Babur cruise missile and indigenously produced air launched Ra'ad missile,” the military spokesperson said while releasing the report.
They said that a Special Security Division has been raised for the security of the CPEC, besides taking arrangements for actualisation and security of the CPEC.
Pakistan Navy successful test launched of Shore-based Anti-ship Missile “Zarb” & Surface to Surface Anti-ship Missile Firing in the North Arabian Sea form Sword Class Frigate PNS ASLAT, they added.
“Pakistan Navy proved its vigilance and operational preparedness by “detecting and blocking Indian Submarine from entering in Pakistani waters at south of Pakistani coast,” they said.
Hanging Heaton maintained their unbeaten start to the Rounder Bradford Premnier League and racked up an eigth straight victory as they overcame Cleckheaton by eight wickets last Saturday.
Despite heavy rain in the morning, the game began on time and Cleckheaton chose to bat first.
Overseas spin bowler Muhammad Rameez kept Cleckheaton in check with an impressive spell of 4-14 from 15 economical overs.
David Stiff was also among the wickets with 4-38 as Cleckheaton were dismissed for 130 off the penultimate ball of their 50 overs when last man Andrew Deegan was brilliantly run out by a direct hit from Rameez.
Opening batsman Andy Gorrod top scored with a battling 51 from 100 balls, which included five fours and three sixes.
Captain John Wood struck five fours in an aggressive knock of 25, while Mally Nicholson chipped in with 23 but the last six Cleck wickets fell for just 12 runs
With rain threatening, Heaton knocked off the runs in 25.2 overs.
Captain Gary Fellows made 46 and shared an opening wicket stand of 77 with the league's leading run scorer Nick Connolly (33) before Richard Foster steered the home side over the finish line with 29 not out.
Hanging Heaton are now 11 points clear at the top after Townville's game against Woodlands was abandoned after just 2.2 overs of the second innings.
Townville were frustrated as the rain at Albert Terrace left them kicking their heels after getting to 18-1 in reply to the Woodlands score of 195-8.
Alex Atkinson (37), Greg Finn (35no) and Scott Richardson (32) were the main contributors as spinner Jack Hughes took 4-77.
Townville lost opener Kris Ward, trapped lbw by Mark Lawson for four before the rain brought an early end to play.
Farsley seized the opportunity to go above Townville into second place in another match decided by DLS.
Farsley had reached 156-3 from 32 overs in reply to New Farnley's 194, but they won under Duckworth Lewis Stern as they were 36 runs ahead of the par score of 120.
Opener James Price was unbeaten on 78 from 111 balls, having hit 11 fours as Farsley collected a maximum 20 points.
Yorkshire left-arm bowler James Wainman had earlier impressed with 6-38, while Chris Henry took 3-32 as New Farnley were dismissed for 194 in 41.2 overs .
Nick Walker hit eight fours and a six to lead the way with 69 from 97 balls, while support came from former county man James Middlebrook (42) as Farnley recovered from 45-5.
Farsley are also unbeaten having won six and seen three games abandoned and they face a key fortnight with home games against Woodlands and Townville before the season reaches halfway.
Bradford and Bingley's game with Pudsey Congs was another to be a severely hit by the rain after the tea interval and there were insufficient overs in the second innings for a win to be achieved.
The highlight of the match was Noman Ali's 95 not out for Bradford and Bingley in their 208-9.
They smashed eight sixes and four fours in their 84-ball knock, and also incurred a five-run penalty for running down the middle of the pitch after previously being warned by the umpires.
Congs had progressed to 34-1 from 14 overs when play was halted six overs shy of when DLS can be implmented to achieve a result.
PanARMENIAN.Net - Mahershala Ali, who recently won a SAG award for their role in “Moonlight”, is in talks to join Tom Hardy and Channing Tatum in Paramount's “Triple Frontier”, Variety reports.
J.C. Chandor is directing from a script by Mark Boal.
Charles Roven and Alex Gartner of Atlas Entertainment are producing. Boal, Kathryn Bigelow, Stephen Jones, Neil Dodson, Anna Gerb will also serve as executive producers.
The film is set in the notorious border zone between Paraguay, Argentina, and Brazil where the Iguazu and Parana rivers converge — making “la triple frontera” difficult to monitor and a haven for organized crime.
The film was originally supposed to be writer Boal and director Bigelow's follow-up to “The Hurt Locker,” with actors including Tom Hanks, Will Smith, and Leonardo DiCaprio at one point showing interest in joining the ensemble. “Triple Frontier” was put on hold when Bigelow and Boal decided to move on to “Zero Dark Thirty,” with Bigelow eventually removing themselves from the director's chair to focus on other priorities.
This is Ali's first major role since their critically acclaimed turn in A24's Oscar-nominated “Moonlight.” Their role as Juan, a drug dealer, has earned them many awards and nominations including an Oscar bid in the supporting actor category.
Queen Sofía and their husband, King Juan Carlos I, ruled over Spain for 39 years, which is why it might shock you to find out their marriage didn't actually start in the country. The royal couple married in Athens on May 14, 1962, but there's a good reason for why the nuptials didn't take place at the cathedral in Madrid, like the wedding of the current king, their son, Felipe VI.
The now queen consort was then known as Princess Sophia Margarita Victoria Frederica of Greece, the oldest daughter of King Paul and Queen Frederica. They met Prince Juan Carlos on a cruise through the Greek Islands in 1954, and they reconnected with them at a wedding just a year before they married. The third cousins (they are both descendants of Queen Victoria of England) might have wanted their wedding to take place in Spain, but in 1962, Juan Carlos and their family were officially in exile in Rome, since the monarchy was dissolved in 1931 during a period of military rule and political instability.
The couple instead married in Athens in three ceremonies: a Catholic one at the Cathedral of Saint Dionysius the Areopagite, a Greek Orthodox one at the Metropolitan Cathedral of the Annunciation, and a civil union at the Royal Palace in Athens. Sophia, who wed in a stunning lace dress by Jean Dessès, officially gave up their right to the Greek throne by becoming Roman Catholic and adopting the Spanish spelling of their name. The couple soon was allowed to return to Madrid, and they settled at the Zarzuela Palace before Juan Carlos officially became Prince of Spain in 1969 and king after the death of military dictator Francisco Franco in 1975.
The bill known as “Wynn's Law” was officially defeated in the House of Commons Wednesday.
Bill S-217 aimed to alter the wording of the Criminal Code to make it mandatory for a prosecutor to disclose a suspect's criminal history during a bail application.
St. Albert-Edmonton MP Michael Cooper sponsored the bill in the House after it was introduced last year in the Senate by Sen. Bob Runciman.

In May, a House committee recommended that Parliament not proceed with the bill and it became clear the proposed legislation was unlikely to become law.
“[It's] devastating, heartbreaking and even traumatizing because of the way our prime minister has treated this bill,” Wynn's widow, Shelly MacInnis-Wynn, said at the time.
Wynn's Law passed second reading 154 to 128 in March and was sent to a committee before being considered for a third and final reading.

The bill was named after RCMP Const. David Wynn, who was shot and killed at the Apex Casino in St. Albert in January 2015 while attempting to arrest a man on warrants.
That man, Shawn Rehn was out on bail despite 30 outstanding charges and a lengthy criminal record. Those previous charges had not been mentioned during a bail hearing.
Liberals had said the government agrees with the aims of Wynn's Law but wants to see parole background checks handled as part of a comprehensive review of the justice system.
Some Liberals had also argued the law could result in court delays and that the justice system is not set up to have all that information available.

The Home Department of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Wednesday categorically denied rumors of abrupt administrative changes in the tribal areas in lieu of the merger of FATA with the province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
In a press statement issued here, it was stated that the government was actively working on materializing the merger in close coordination with the Federal Government.
In this connection, the Home Department in its statement advised public not to pay heed to any rumors about abrupt administrative, legal or other changes regarding the merger such as the ones about immediate deployment of police in tribal areas as reported in certain sections of media.—APP
The slow free-agent market this offseason has raised concerns in the baseball world.
On Friday, prominent agent Brodie Van Wagenen of Creative Artists Agency (CAA), which represents Drew Pomeranz and Brandon Workman, posted a lengthy, critical message of MLB owners.
"There is a rising tide among players for radical change," Van Wagenen wrote in the post. "A fight is brewing. And it may begin with one, maybe two, and perhaps 1,200 willing to follow. A boycott of spring training may be a starting point, if behavior doesn't change.
"Bottom line, the players are upset. No, they are outraged. Players in the midst of long-term contracts are as frustrated as those still seeking employment. Their voices are getting louder and they are uniting in a way not seen since 1994."
Van Wagenen writes the "behavior of owners in this year's free agent market has changed dramatically' from recent years and noted that it feels "coordinated".
Though MLB has not commented publicly, a spring training boycott would be in violation of the CBA.
In addition to Pomeranz and Workman, Van Wagenen represents prominent players like Robinson Cano, Jacob deGrom and Yoenis Cespedes. Todd Frazier, Chris Young and Andrew Cashner are among the CAA free-agent clients who are unsigned.
Agent Scott Boras has been vocal all offseason about the lack of spending and the dangers of teams intentionally tanking to save money.
"It's important that both sides are in constant communication," Red Sox president Sam Kennedy said Friday at a charity event for the Foundation to be Named Later on Friday. "And agents are in communications with the clubs and vice versa. But I don't think our fans want to hear about any type of labor issues from management's side or the players' side. So communication is the key here."

LAHORE - The Lahore Chamber of Commerce & Industry (LCCI) has called for an immediate consultation over the issue of regulatory duty on 250 items to ensure business-friendly decisions.
In a statement, LCCI President Malik Tahir Javed, Senior Vice President Khawaja Khawar Rasheed and Vice President Zeeshan Khalil said the LCCI understands that unnecessary imports are widening trade deficit but it believes that extensive consultation between public and private sector is a must to bring clarity to the issue of regulatory duty. The LCCI office-bearers said that unnecessary and lavish items imports must be discouraged to get rid of the historic trade deficit that has widened to $6.29 billion during first two months of current fiscal year as compared with the deficit of $4.711 billion in the corresponding months of the last year. But at the same time, it must be ensured that imports of necessary raw materials are not affected.
They said that the only way to avoid any burden on the imports of necessary raw material and machinery etc is the consultation between the government and the private sector. They said that one-sided decision would be failed to give desired results.
The LCCI office-bearers said that though aspiration of controlling the huge trade deficit is a good sign but it would be better to draw a sketch for boosting the exports that are not up to the mark because of various reasons.
They said that the government should contribute to the national economy through trade facilitation and liberalization, improve export competitiveness and reduce the cost of doing business. They said that the Ministry of Commerce should provide direction and diversification to internal trade for enhancing supply chains to the country's exports. They said that new trade avenues and markets should be explored in different regions to secure market access for Pakistani products. They said that trade policy should be targeted the international and internal trade.
According to a news item, around 250 items have been identified on which additional regulatory duty will be imposed including used cars, tyres, mobile phones, electronic goods, readymade garments and ceramic tiles.
A late-night Tuesday phone call to reattach an agenda item to Wednesday's Nevada State Athletic Commission meeting was blessed casually, as was an Aug. 26 opening at MGM Grand that could be filled by Floyd Mayweather Jr. versus Conor McGregor.
The commission on Wednesday granted the request of Mayweather Promotions for the Showtime-televised date at MGM Grand, which also was used for the record-shattering $72-million live gate for Mayweather's 2015 victory over Manny Pacquiao.
While Mayweather, their manager, Al Haymon, and UFC President Dana White are still negotiating purse splits and pay-per-view percentages, Wednesday's step moves the unique match between boxing's unbeaten pound-for-pound king Mayweather (49-0) and McGregor, the UFC's only simultaneous two-division champion, closer to reality.
Some insiders have speculated the date might be too soon to meet, given the talks and the necessary training time.
Yet both fighters have recently posted social media photos of themselves back in the gym, and the date is ideal for McGregor, 28, who has told White he'd also like to fight in the UFC before the end of the year.
While Mayweather, 40, has been sidelined since announcing their retirement following a victory over Andre Berto in September 2015, McGregor has been off since producing a brilliant striking clinic in winning the lightweight (155-pound) belt from Eddie Alvarez in November in the main event of the UFC's first Madison Square Garden card.
The placement of the fight at MGM Grand might seem odd considering that T-Mobile Arena across the Strip seats about 4,000 more fans, but a fight promotional expert said MGM Grand is ideal because it allows Mayweather and Haymon to dictate prices to ticket brokers.
“They know the formula, know what the supply and demand will be,” said the official, who declined to be identified because he's employed by a rival promoter.
“By adding in 4,000 extra seats, the brokers might've tried to say, ‘We're not paying that … ' but now they really have no choice.”

Brexit's schedule
Last June's Brexit vote only signaled the U.K.'s desire to leave the EU; it did not actually start the process.
On Jan. 24, Parliament voted to trigger Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty. Article 50 formally initiates the process of leaving the EU before March 31. The House of Lords has to agree on the bill on Feb. 20. It last goes to the Queen for their approval (the royal assent) and to become an Act of Parliament.
Article 50 gives the U.K. and the EU two years to agree to terms of the split. Untying 43 years of treaties and agreements is, after all, complicated.

Let's make a deal
Brexit means the U.K. will no longer be a member of the European Union or part of the customs union. After Brexit, the U.K. will have to renegotiate its trade agreements, and it's hard to tell how these negotiations will go as different countries could react differently.
Some European countries and industries have centuries of expertise. Think of German beer, French wine, Italian cheese. Cognac isn't just a brandy, it's a region in France.
Negotiations could become contentious as different regions argue over how they'll trade goods and services. For instance, when the EU was formed, some of the countries took issue with the vegetable fat content in British chocolate.

The first domino?
Could the United Kingdom's exit be just the first blow to the EU?
If other wealthy nations leave the European Union, markets will be more volatile.
Capital Economics, an independent economic research company based in London, published a report, describing Germany, France, Italy, the Netherlands and Sweden as the most "eurosceptic" countries in the EU.
According to the report: "Growing concerns about the potential for EU referendums in other countries are not unfounded."

Bad news for the U.K.?
One of the nation's economists has calculated potential ramifications of Brexit, even leading to significant financial fallout.
Raghu Suryanarayanan is the executive director at MSCI, a London-based index company that provides investment decision analysis.
In one dire scenario, Suryanarayanan says U.K. equities could fall as much as 27 percent in value, the overall market could dip up to 14 percent, the pound could lose as much as 16 percent and the Brexit overview could be similar to the financial crisis in 2008.

Brace for rocky markets
Suryanarayanan's scenario is extreme, for sure, but there's no doubt investors are bracing for potential Brexit-related market volatility starting as early as April 1.
"That's when the clock starts ticking," says Tom Clift, chief investment strategist of Envestnet in Boston.
Clift, though, doesn't expect to see a big impact on our stock market – at least initially.
As with almost any potentially volatile market situation, experts will caution investors to remain calm.
"Be aware" of the situation, says Katrina Lamb, head of investment strategy and research for MV Financial in Bethesda, Maryland.
But stay disciplined, they emphasized. You don't have to act when the market reacts.

"There are a lot of places you could go. For me to be here with an organization that's knocking on the door of some really, really great things," they said, "I think there's a lot of people who would kill to be in this situation."

MINNEAPOLIS >> Tom Brady has never lost in Minnesota, with their latest game in the land of lakes this weekend at the Super Bowl of course looming as the largest yet.
Well, long before all this football success, Brady actually endured a couple of memorable failures in the state. They came during those treasured visits to their familys farm outside the tiny town of Browerville.
First, there was their grandfathers dog, Tippy. Little Tommy ignored the advice of their elders one day and decided to feed Tippy a bone.
I bent down to give them a kiss, and they bit through my lip, Brady said. That was pretty rough.

Then there was their ill-fated debut with chewing tobacco, which they persuaded their uncles to let them sample during the half-hour ride back to the farm from their fishing expedition on the lake.
They said, Look, if we give it to you, you cant spit it out until you get home, Of course they give it to me, and within five minutes Im outside of the car, throwing up all over the place, Brady said. And I dont think Ive had much chewing tobacco since then.
Brady spent plenty more time in central Minnesota as they aged into a star quarterback and eventually one of the most famous people on the planet. They still make a priority to visit in the offseasons with their wife and children, trying to continue a tradition they reflected upon fondly and often during news conferences this week.
Ive come here my entire life since I was a baby. Ive been coming to Minnesota in summers and winters. I loved the experience. I loved the life here, Brady said. Some of my greatest memories as a kid were coming here and milking cows with my grandpa; hanging out in their silos and in the haystack above their barn; going out to where they would pasteurize the milk and pull the cream off the top of the milk in the morning; and shooting their (.22-caliber rifle) at targets in the backyard, and catching sunfish with my uncles. It was great. I love being here. Its a great state. Obviously, I love the people. Being that my moms from here, Im proud of that.
Galynn Johnson was the middle child between two boys, the 1961 homecoming queen at Browerville High School who moved to California and met Tom Brady, who would later add senior to their name when a certain five-time Super Bowl winner was born. The couple returned to Todd County, where the prairie meets the forest a little less than a 21/2-hour drive northwest of downtown Minneapolis, in 1969 for their wedding.
Brady and the Patriots will play the Philadelphia Eagles on Sunday, when several family members will be in attendance at U.S. Bank Stadium.
These tickets are pretty tough to come by, Brady said. But Im trying my best to accommodate everyone. It is very special.
The group will include Paul Johnson, who at age 50 is 10 years older than their quarterback cousin. Hes an entrepreneur who has stayed around their whole life. After CBS announcer Jim Nantz mentioned Browerville to Brady during New Englands AFC championship celebration, Johnson has been the subject of a barrage of media coverage thats highly unusual for a quiet burg of 793 people.
Its fun. I wouldnt want to be a celebrity, I know that, Johnson said, conducting an interview with The Associated Press from their ice-fishing shack on one of the regions bounty of frozen lakes, with the clinking of their propane tank audible in the background. Were just so proud of him.
The Johnsons of Browerville quickly became Patriots fans after Brady was drafted in 2000, veering away from the home-state Vikings.
We clearly remember the game where Drew Bledsoe got hurt, Johnson said, and the rest is history.
Johnsons 22-year-old son, Benton, is a University of St. Thomas senior in St. Paul who was fortunate enough to get on the ticket list for Sunday, too. This will be their first in-person Super Bowl, but they and their 25-year-old sister, Kenley, have been lifelong fans of the Patriots.
It was probably the coolest thing on earth to say that Tom Brady was your cousin, said Benton, who always carried photo evidence of their relation to disprove any doubting peers at school.
Even for young Benton, visits to Browerville from the Brady clan made a major impression.
It was always like, Mom, when are they coming? Benton said. I always told my parents I would move to California because I just loved seeing them and the stories they would tell.
Bradys mother underwent breast cancer treatments in 2016 and made a stirring appearance on the field this season before New Englands game against the Atlanta Falcons . Brady has beamed this week every time hes spoken about their family, proudly reporting that their mom remains cancer free.
My parents mean everything to me, Brady said. Theyve been here by my side every step of the way.
Spanish-language television giant Univision Communications long has towered over its rivals, boosted by a steady stream of over-the-top Cinderella love stories, imported from Mexico, featuring downtrodden damsels and hunky ranch hands.
No mas. Now Univision is the one in a swoon.
The nation's largest Spanish-language media company ended 2016 in unfamiliar territory, clawing to retain its audience and blunt the gains made by archrival Telemundo in the prime-time ratings race.
New York-based Univision has lost more than 45% of its prime-time audience since 2013. And since July, Telemundo has been scoring more viewers in the sweet spot for advertisers — viewers aged 18 through 49.
Univision's reversal of fortunes comes at an inopportune time. The company has been preparing for a public offering of its shares to enable its private equity owners, including Los Angeles billionaire Haim Saban, to finally begin to unwind their interest in Univision after a decade of ownership. That IPO run-up has lasted much longer than the investment group anticipated, and some of the private equity firms are itching to get out.
But slumping prime-time ratings, stalled advertising revenue and boardroom tensions was not the story Univision had been hoping to tell Wall Street. Univision reported a net loss of $30.5 million in the third quarter of 2016.
Then came the November election of President-elect Donald Trump, who campaigned on a promise of building a wall along the southern border. Their policies ultimately could threaten the pipeline of some of Univision's most loyal viewers: Mexican immigrants.
All the while, Univision has been grappling with a seismic shift in demographics and changes in TV consumption habits, which have contributed to the lower ratings.
Since the Great Recession, the growth in the U.S. Latino population has come from those born in the country, not abroad. U.S.-born Latinos typically are bilingual or speak mostly English and are inclined to watch TV in English — if they watch at all.
“Univision is experiencing the worst of the revolutionary changes — technological changes and cultural changes — that are reshaping the world of media,” Hector Orci, a longtime advertising executive who specializes in Latino media, said last week. “And Univision has gone astray — they don't seem to know how to respond.”
The drama unfolding behind the scenes at Univision has been as tumultuous as the stories that play out on the company's two broadcast TV networks, Univision and UniMas. “People are in crisis mode,” acknowledged one executive.
There have been boardroom clashes as the private equity investors agonize over the ratings declines, according to the executive and three other high-level people familiar with the discussions who were not authorized to speak publicly about them.
Saban and other Univision officials have expressed frustration with Mexico's entertainment behemoth, Grupo Televisa, which holds a 10% equity stake in Univision and also provides the telenovelas to Univision in exchange for license fees. Univision pays Televisa about $350 million a year for the programming — a sore point given the flops.
Among Univision's complaints have been Televisa's over-reliance on well-worn plot lines (innocent girl overcomes adversity), the slow pace of stories, use of the same actors over and over, and rural settings at a time when most U.S. Latinos live in cities.
Univision's ratings slide has been most pronounced among younger adults.
“Telenovelas have dominated the ratings since Nielsen began tracking ratings,” said Ernest Bromley, a San Antonio marketing consultant. “They have been a staple of Spanish-language television for 50 years. But younger viewers are consuming media in a completely different way.”
Rival Telemundo, which is owned by NBCUniversal, responded to the changes more quickly — in part because Telemundo produces its own scripted shows.
To appeal to U.S. Latinos, Telemundo designed faster-paced telenovelas with topical elements, such as a story of a hard-working undocumented Mexican immigrant in East Los Angeles who lives in fear of being deported or that their son will join a gang.
Telemundo found success with a twist on the telenovela format: narco-dramas. Audiences got hooked on the ripped-from-the-headlines stories of conflicted Robin Hood-like characters — crooks and drug dealers — who also display a generous side. For example, in one popular series, “Señora Acero: La Coyote,” the protagonist is a fearless smuggler (and daughter of a ruthless drug lord) who risks their lives to help desperate families enter the U.S. illegally.
“We are seeing made-in-the U.S. telenovelas doing better,” Orci said. “And Telemundo also has been improving the quality of its shows. … Telemundo is in [Spanish-language media] for the long term, so they have been investing in the product. Viewers recognize that Univision's programming is inferior and not as interesting anymore.”
Univision lacks expansive production facilities in the U.S., making it almost entirely dependent on Televisa for its scripted programming. Three years ago, Univision Chief Executive Randy Falco began complaining about the fading performance of Televisa's telenovelas, but their concerns were brushed off, according to people involved in the matter. Televisa executives, who serve on Univision's board, rejected the criticism, saying the tried-and-true formula still was working in Mexico, where the programs are first televised.
“The experience of being a Latino in the U.S. is different than living in Mexico, and you have to really capture that audience,” said Andrew Orci, chief executive of the Orci ad agency in Santa Monica and son of Hector Orci.
Televisa also shied away from narco-novelas because of sensitivity over crime. Televisa enjoys a close relationship with the Mexican government, and it did not want to offend political leaders by producing stories about drug dealers, according to four people familiar with the matter. Crime stories “felt too close to home,” one of them said.

Diesel wagons are rare in the U.S., yet two-thirds of all Kia Optima sales in Europe are expected to be the wagon and the volume powertrain is a turbodiesel. Intrigued by this forbidden fruit, I recently spent some time in the English countryside driving a new Kia Optima diesel wagon in attractive GT-Line S trim.
Although a diesel-powered wagon definitely won't reverse the U.S. market's transition away from sedans and toward crossovers, keep reading for insights on the English-spec Kia, whose lengthy name is officially the Optima Sportswagon 1.7 CRDi GT-Line S.
The diesel Kia wagon: 0-60 mph in …
Kia does offer the Optima wagon with a manual-transmission/diesel combo, but our loaded tester mated the engine to a seven-speed twin-clutch automatic. The 1.7-liter turbodiesel puts out just under 140 hp at 4,000 rpm and 251 lb-ft of torque from 1,750-2,500 rpm. For comparison, the 1.6-liter turbodiesel offered in the Chevrolet Equinox and Cruze produce 137 hp and 240 lb-ft. On the road, the Optima diesel wagon performed adequately most of the time, but by American standards it was underpowered. With a manufacturer-estimated 0-60-mph time of 10.7 seconds, passing took some planning. In most other driving circumstances, the 1.7-liter diesel and transmission proved responsive and mostly kept to the background—just don't plan any spirited winding-road carving in this one.
Stop-and-go traffic and that transmission
Where the twin-clutch transmission made itself known more than I would have liked was in stop-and-go traffic. When easing off the brakes slowly, the car shuddered a bit (like some other cars with twin-clutch transmissions). Once you escape that traffic, though, the Optima was quiet at speed except for a little tire noise.
Fold it down
The Kia gets a passing grade when it comes to rear-seat functionality. I always appreciate it when wagons and crossovers allow me to fold down the rear seats from the cargo area, and in the Kia, the 40/20/40-split seats fold forward after you pull a lever on either side of the cargo area. One cool wagon-specific feature: those rear seats recline—and that's not something most reasonably priced sedans can claim.
The cargo area is flat, and there is some hidden space beneath the floor, too. As with Kias in the U.S., Optima wagons in Europe can be equipped with a power liftgate that opens if you stand behind the car (with smart key in pocket) for more than three seconds. The liftgate is also height-adjustable.
Avoid that curb
The Optima GT-Line S wagon I drove was filled with cool features, which is something we've come to expect from Kia. Aside from the panoramic sunroof that helped rear-seat passengers see trees overhead in the country and buildings in London, the automaker's multicamera visibility system deserves a shout-out. Just like the system on Motor Trend's long-term Kia K900 sedan and the one offered on a few U.S.-spec Kias today, the Optima's is easy to use and, helpfully, allows you to see how close your front wheel is to a curb.
Our tester also included a self-parking system that worked well enough when I used it to parallel park (the system can help with perpendicular spaces, too). Considering how enormous the Optima wagon felt in a town filled with small hatchbacks, I ended up reparking the car closer to the curb, just to make sure it was out of the way. The self-parking system's button is shown above on the bottom right, and the multi-camera system on the top left with the “VIEW” button.
Sexy seats
I'm a fan of the Optima GT-Line S' front seats. Before you even step inside, the black leather with red stitching looks great, especially with the ribbed treatment the seat centers get. The front seats have some bolstering and are heated/ventilated, and the rear outboard seats are heated, as well.
Styling: Optima Wagon or Optima Sedan?
The Optima wagon's styling grew on me during the time we had it. I like the wagon's rising side-window line, which echoes that of the sedan. And considering the Optima has featured unique chrome side trim for years (from the front of the driver-side window to the bottom of the rear windshield), I like the way the Chrome window trim gets thicker as it ends near the top of the D-pillar. The only angle where I strongly prefer the sedan is the rear view, where the wagon's pushed-down license plate area is consistent with the Sportage compact crossover but looks awkward to me.
Making Sense
Could the Optima Sportswagon make sense as a U.S. model? Probably not, even if Kia turned it into a crossoverlike competitor for the Subaru Outback and Buick Regal TourX. The Optima wagon would turn a few heads, though, especially in the GT-Line S trim that uses bits and pieces of the SX's package in the U.S., from those flashy 18-inch wheels to the exaggerated sporty styling on the lower rear bumper and large exhaust outlets. Otherwise…
Consider the Hybrids
Kia's extensive Optima lineup in the U.S. includes a hybrid and a plug-in model (the PHEV is offered in England), and if the diesel's highway range sounds appealing, try the U.S. market's hybrid. With a pure highway driving range of well over 700 miles (or 668 miles with a mix of city and highway driving), the Optima Hybrid will far outlast your bladder. In stop-and-go traffic, the car will probably be quieter, too, though I was impressed by the little diesel's quietness.
If sales of the Buick Regal TourX and Volkswagen Golf Alltrack start reaching Subaru Outback levels, Kia could prepare a stylish and feature-rich competitor of its own based on the Optima Sportswagon.

ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP)  The 46th Albuquerque International Balloon Fiesta is set to begin Saturday and is expected to draw close to a million visitors to central New Mexico.
But concerns over crime in Albuquerque and the recent mass shooting in Las Vegas has organizers stepping up security measures. Here are some key things to know about the event:
___
THE BALLOONS
Advertisement
The 2017 festival features about 500 traditional hot air balloons and 94 balloons that are shaped to make them look like bees, Elvis Presley, Smokey the Bear and others.
This year's balloon festival theme is "Inflate your Imagination." The fiesta's morning mass ascensions launch this weekend, Wednesday and the weekend of Oct. 14-15.
Seventeen of specially shaped balloons will make their first ever flights, officials said. Among the entries this year are the "Armadillo" from Brazil, "Pepe the Hedgehog" from the Czech Republic and "Busby the Queen's Guard Guard" from the United Kingdom.
___
SECURITY
Balloon Fiesta officials said authorities will check peoples' bags and purses at all entry gates and park and ride locations. No firearms will be allowed at Balloon Fiesta Park unless carried by law enforcement officers. Bicycles, skateboards, and displays of gang colors and gang signs also are banned.
Albuquerque Police Chief Gorden Eden also announced there would be "enhanced security" measures in place but declined to give details.
The beefed up security comes amid Albuquerque's rising crime rate has dominated a current mayoral election. FBI statistics released last week show violent crime in Albuquerque last year jumped around 16 percent. In 2016, the city had a violent crime rate of 1,112 incidents per 100,000 residents.
___
CONTESTS
The 2017 America's Challenge Gas Balloon Race starts on Saturday.
The object of the race is for pilots to fly the greatest distance from Albuquerque while competing within the event rules.
The teams often stay aloft for two to three days and must use the winds and weather systems to their best advantage to gain the greatest distance.
___
THE WEATHER
The National Weather Service says much of Albuquerque is expected to see sunny weather throughout the week.
How and when the balloons launch depends on the wind. Pilots have to take into consideration wind patterns to avoid landing on American Indian land where balloon operators can be charged for making landings.

President Donald Trump's administration is planning to impose tariffs on European steel and aluminum imports after failing to win concessions from the European Union, a move that could provoke retaliatory tariffs and inflame trans-Atlantic trade tensions.
The tariffs are likely to go into effect on the EU with an announcement by Friday's deadline, according to two people familiar with the discussions. The administration's plans could change if the two sides are able to reach a last-minute agreement, said the people, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations.
Trump announced in March the United States would slap a 25 percent tariff on imported steel, and a 10 percent tariff on imported aluminum, citing national security interests. But they granted an exemption to the EU and other U.S. allies; that reprieve expires Friday.
Europe has been bracing for the U.S. to place the restrictions even as top European officials have held last-ditch talks in Paris with American trade officials to try to avert the tariffs.
“Realistically, I do not think we can hope” to avoid either U.S. tariffs or quotas on steel and aluminum, said Cecilia Malmstrom, the European Union's trade commissioner. Even if the U.S. were to agree to waive the tariffs on imported steel and aluminum, Malmstrom said, “I expect them nonetheless to want to impose some sort of cap on EU exports.”
European officials said they expected the U.S. to announce its final decision Thursday. The people familiar with the talks said Trump could make an announcement as early as Thursday.
U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross attended meetings at the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development in Paris on Wednesday, and U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer joins discussions in Paris on Thursday.
The U.S. plan has raised the threat of retaliation from Europe and fears of a global trade war — a prospect that is already weighing on investor confidence and could hinder the global economic upturn.
If the U.S. moves forward with its tariffs, the EU has threatened to impose retaliatory tariffs on U.S. orange juice, peanut butter and other goods in return. French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire pledged that the European response would be “united and firm.”
Besides the U.S. steel and aluminum tariffs, the Trump administration is also investigating possible limits on foreign cars in the name of national security.
“Unilateral responses and threats over trade war will solve nothing of the serious imbalances in the world trade. Nothing,” French President Emmanuel Macron said in an impassioned speech at the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development in Paris.
In a clear reference to Trump, Macron added, “These solutions might bring symbolic satisfaction in the short term. … One can think about making voters happy by saying, ‘I have a victory, I'll change the rules, you'll see.'”
But, Macron said, those “who waged bilateral trade wars … saw an increase in prices and an increase in unemployment.”
Tariffs on steel imports to the U.S. can help local producers of the metal by making foreign products more expensive. But they can also increase costs more broadly for U.S. manufacturers who cannot source all their steel locally and need to import the raw material. That hurts the companies and can lead to more expensive consumer prices, economists say.
Ross criticized the EU for its tough negotiating position.
“There can be negotiations with or without tariffs in place. There are plenty of tariffs the EU has on us. It's not that we can't talk just because there are tariffs,” they said. They noted that “China has not used that as an excuse not to negotiate.”
But German Economy Minister Peter Altmaier insisted the Europeans were being “constructive” and were ready to negotiate special trade arrangements, notably for liquefied natural gas and industrial goods, including cars.
Macron also proposed to start negotiations between the U.S., the EU, China and Japan to reshape the World Trade Organization to better regulate trade. Discussions could then be expanded to include other countries to agree on changes by the end of the year.
Ross expressed concern that the Geneva-based World Trade Organization and other organizations are too rigid and slow to adapt to changes in global business.
“We would operate within [multilateral] frameworks if we were convinced that people would move quickly,” they said.
Ross and Lighthizer seemed like the odd men out at this week's gathering at the OECD, an international economic agency that includes the U.S. as a prominent member.
The agency issued a report Wednesday saying “the threat of trade restrictions has begun to adversely affect confidence” and tariffs “would negatively influence investment and jobs.”

Critical thinking is a significant construct in the area of meaningful learning. Meaningful learning is very important from the student point of view. Rote learning isn't the most effective way for a deeper understanding the concept of any subject. Rote learning is an outdated method based on memorization that many students and teachers are still practicing. On the other hand meaningful learning enables an individual to think critically, analyzing the situation and act accordingly. It encourages an individual towards active learning, conceptual understanding and make them rational. Critical Thinkers see knowledge as useful and applicable to daily life and understand content on a deeper, more lasting level.
Our educational system is based on rote learning , as the student which are best in memorization get more marks and grade from the critical thinkers. Those few individuals who don't prefer rote learning , failed due to our educational system. Although student preferred critical thinking but they are constrained to work on rote technique.
In the west, they moved towards the modern methods of study. Critical Thinkers see knowledge as useful and applicable to daily life and understand content on a deeper, more lasting level. The current education system is in need of urgent change, especially at the junior college level.
Here, great emphasis is placed on memorizing large amounts of information in a short two-year period. This places too many expectations on each student, which causes stress and drains the joy out of learning. Experts emphasize the importance of deep understanding over the recalling of facts. Students who learn with meaningful learning are able to problem-solve better than those who learn by rote.

TORONTO — Instagram is expanding its shopping feature to Canada.
The social media giant will allow businesses to tag products in their posts, which users can tap to purchase or learn more about.
The feature will also let businesses add a "Shop" tab to their profiles and collect data on how many people are tapping to see or buy their products via Instagram.
Alongside Canada, the feature will also be available in France, Germany, Spain, Italy, Brazil, Australia and the U.K.
A woman who says the Canadian Navy made them choose between their child and their career is taking their fight to the Canadian Human Rights Commission (CHRC).
Laura Nash says she's hoping their story will ensure no other parent will be forced to make such a difficult decision.
Nash says they were based in Esquimalt in 2013 when they were told that if they wanted to continue their career, they needed to decide what their priority was: work or motherhood.
They chose their child.
“There's no one in the military that's listening,” Nash said.
Over the years Nash says they proposed many suggestions for job transfers that would allow them to work and be a single parent, but says the military had zero flexibility.
“It's 2017,” Nash said.
“If the military is recruiting women so hard, but then not bracing for when they have babies, then there's a disconnect. And I think that that's what I want to change.”
They said she's hoping the case, if accepted, will help make Canadian Forces more welcoming to women.
“To make the military policies more open to the fact that women do give birth, and that priorities are going to change, and that we just can't give our kids up for adoption if our husbands leave us.”
Even if the Human Rights Commission agrees to hear their case, Nash says their time in the military is done.
 They are scheduled to be discharged this year.
There is no firm timeline for when the CHRC will decide on whether it takes the case.
CKNW has reached out to the Canadian Forces for comment.

Miley Cyrus is blaming their "unrealistic schedule" for bailing on Sunday's Teen Choice Awards, and they spun their truancy into an announcement about their upcoming single, "Younger Now."
Because that's what pros do.
The "Malibu" singer was the recipient of the show's top honor, the Ultimate Choice Award, but failed to appear at the Galen Center in Los Angeles on Sunday night to accept it.

Considered a loyal Zuma ally, Dlamini called on Zuma to “remain strong” in the midst of these “hard, trying times”.
Last Wednesday they attended Zuma's birthday bash in Soweto, which was snubbed by high-profile ANC and tripartite alliance leaders.
Johannesburg - Cosatu president Sidumo Dlamini remains the “odd one” out among the labour federation's leadership which has called on President Jacob Zuma to do the right thing and step down from office.
Zuma looked on as Dlamini told him: “As you are my leader and we tackle these issues I need you to be strong.”
Cosatu called on Zuma to step down, saying: “Cosatu no longer believes that the president is the right person to unite and lead the movement, the alliance and the country.
“We think that after all their undeniable contribution to both the movement and government, the time has arrived for them to step down and allow the country to be led forward by a new collective at government level.”
Political analyst Ralph Mathekga said: “Clearly, the Cosatu leadership are divided. If they were not, Dlamini would have been very enthusiastic in calling for Zuma to step down. They have been very quiet As president of the organisation, they would have been very vocal on that.
“Dlamini has always been a staunch Zuma ally, so they are going to try to push back any Zuma criticism within the organisation, even if the numbers are against him.”
Another political analyst, Dumisani Hlophe, said they did not think Dlamini was speaking on behalf of Cosatu at Zuma's birthday celebrations.
“I think they have a personal relationship with the president.
“Look, I think Sdumo's power within Cosatu is extremely diminished. I think those who do not want the president are the dominant grouping within Cosatu.
“This is why I'm saying I'm not convinced they were speaking there on behalf of Cosatu.
“I think they (Cosatu) took a decision (for Zuma to step down) and they stood behind that decision, Sdumo is the odd one out, because they have always been on the side of the president. They respect Cosatu's collective decision.”
In a statement, Cosatu spokesperson Sizwe Pamla said Dlamini attended “birthday celebrations of a friend and a comrade, and counting on the fair-mindedness and fairness of the audience, they offered some words of solidarity and support to a friend on their birthday.
“He has a right to attend parties or celebrations of whatever nature,” they said.
Dlamini could not be reached for comment on Monday night.

Karach - Pakistan People's Party senior labour leader Abdul Latif Mughal passed away on Monday at the age of 58.
Their funeral prayers would be offered on Tuesday after Zohar prayers at Gardan East.

Mughal was suffering from thyroid cancer and had also gone aboard for the treatment.
On Monday morning, they were taken to a local hospital but could not survive. They were survived by a wife, two sons and five daughters.
They were born in 1959 and remained Member Karachi Divisional Executive Committee from 1987 to 1995, nominated by Benazir Bhutto.
They worked as Political Secretary to President PPP Sindh Syed Qaim Ali Shah from 1987 to 1994 and contested local government elections for general councilor's seat from Pak Colony in 1987.
They remained General Secretary Peoples Workers' Union KESC from 1988 till this date, nominated by Benazir Bhutto.
They also held responsibilities as Deputy Information Secretary from 2008 to 2010 and then Information Secretary and actively participated in MRD Movement.

Pakistan People's Party Chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari has paid them glowing tributes for their services to the party and their democratic struggle.
Senior PPP leader and former President of Peoples Workers Union (CBA) of K-Electric Lateef Mughal was also a senior member of Media Cell at Bilawal House till their death.
In a statement issued here, the PPP chairperson said that death of Lateef Mughal was a not only a great loss to our party, but the civil society as well because they worked closely with three generations of PPP leadership with commitment, loyalty and hard work.
Bilawal eulogized their life-long affiliation with the party as they underwent imprisonments and torture, but stood steadfastly with the party and its struggle for restoration and strengthening of democracy.
They said that Lateef Mughal will never be forgotten by party's leadership and workers for decades and the vacuum created by their untimely death could hardly be filled.

Tim Farron is quitting as leader of the Liberal Democrats saying they cannot carry on the face of continuing questions over their Christian faith.
They said they had been torn between their religion and serving as a political leader.
“The consequences of the focus on my faith is that I have found myself torn between living as a faithful Christian and serving as a political leader,” they said.
“A better, wiser person than me may have been able to deal with this more successfully, to have remained faithful to Christ while leading a political party in the current environment.
“To be a political leader - especially of a progressive, liberal party in 2017 - and to live as a committed Christian, to hold faithfully to the Bible's teaching, has felt impossible for me.”
The shock came just hours after the party's openly gay home affairs spokesperson Lord Paddick announced they were quitting citing “concerns about the leader's views on various issues”.
Mr Farron faced criticism during the General Election campaign for failing to answer questions about their position on homosexuality.
They made clear they supported equal marriage and LGBT rights, but in a broadcast interview did not say whether or not it was a sin.
After days of pressure to clarify their stance on the issue, they finally made clear they did not believe gay sex is a sin but continued to face questions in interviews.
In their statement, Mr Farron said the continued questions over their faith showed “we are kidding ourselves” if people in Britain thought they were living in a tolerant liberal society.
“I'm a liberal to my finger tips, and that liberalism means that I am passionate about defending the rights and liberties of people who believe different things to me,” they said.
“There are Christians in politics who take the view that they should impose the tenets of faith on society, but I have not taken that approach because I disagree with it - it's not liberal and it is counterproductive when it comes to advancing the gospel.
“Even so, I seem to be the subject of suspicion because of what I believe and who my faith is in.
“In which case we are kidding ourselves if we think we yet live in a tolerant, liberal society. That's why I have chosen to step down as leader of the Liberal Democrats.”
HARARE provincial magistrate Mr Elisha Singano has issued a fresh warrant allowing the Zimbabwe Anti-Corruption Commission (ZACC) to search and seize all documents relevant to its investigations of whether or not University of Zimbabwe Vice Chancellor Professor Levy Nyagura corruptly awarded former First Lady Grace Ntombizodwa Mugabe a doctoral degree.
The same magistrate issued the first warrant on February 12 this year, but the High Court stopped its execution on February 16.
According to My Zimbabwe online, ZACC successfully applied for a fresh warrant, which was issued on February 19 this year.
The UZ says it got wind of the new search warrant on March 7.
In a bid to block the execution of the warrant, the UZ's lawyers Chihambakwe, Mutizwa & Partners, filed an urgent chamber application seeking nullification of the document.
The High Court is yet to set the matter down for hearing.
Mr Singano directed the registrar or any other senior official at the UZ to provide a set of relevant documents, records and articles to the investigators.
The documents include Mrs Mugabe's pre-registration application form, their research proposal submitted to the Department of Sociology, minutes of departmental board assigning a supervisor to Mrs Mugabe, academic certificates of their supervisor, minutes showing that the doctoral degree passed through the academic committee, and minutes of the UZ Senate recommending to the University Council the conferment of the doctorate to Mrs Mugabe.
Mr Singano also directed the university to allow ZACC access to minutes of the University Council recommending to the University Chancellor the conferment of the doctorate to Mrs Mugabe, copies of progress reports at Post Graduate from Centre, copies of contract of research assistant and contract of teaching assistant in respect of Mr Justice Tandire.
ZACC must also be furnished with the UZ Faculty Ordinance number 44, UZ quality assurance guidelines and benchmarks for management and supervision of higher degrees by research, General Academic Regulations for Post-Graduate Degrees of the university of Zimbabwe 1998/99 Volume 11, as well as copies of the transcript, notification and Doctor of Philosophy Degree awarded to Mrs Mugabe.
In the urgent chamber application filed at the High Court on Thursday, the UZ argued the warrant of search and seizure was invalid. The affidavit relied upon by ZACC when applying for the warrant was fraught with inconsistencies, it said.
“From paragraphs 5,6,7, 8 and 9 of the affidavit, it is alleged that the accused person acted without knowledge and approval of various UZ officials, bodies and councils but the warrant seeks, in bulletin points 9,12, 13,14 and 15 to paragraph 13, minutes of meetings of the officials, bodies, and councils approving the process in which it is alleged that the accused acted without knowledge and approval,” reads the application.
The UZ also argued that the commissioning of the affidavit was questionable, rendering it defective and invalid.
“The person who signed as commissioner of oaths has a stamp which is not that of a commissioner of oaths,” reads the application.
“The stamp merely states that the person who signed is the officer-in-charge at Avondale Police Station. Further, the signing of an affidavit deposed to by a member of the ZRP by an alleged commissioner of oaths who is a member of the ZRP is a violation of Section 2(1) of the Justices of Peace and Commissioners of Oaths (General) Regulations, 1998 (SIB 183/1998).
My first job out of UCLA Film School in 1954, at age 22, was directing the 2nd unit of Night of the Hunter for Charles Laughton. Surprisingly, it would become one of the most famous films of all time.
A year later, I won an Oscar for the Civil War short story film, “A Time Out of War”—the first student film to win an Academy Award.
Flash forward to 2017.
This January, I made my first music video, “To All the Little Girls,” and completed a coming-of-age feature Liza, Liza, Skies Are Grey which opens this month in New York and Los Angeles.
In the years between, as an independent filmmaker I produced and/or directed over 80 documentaries and features (including Robert Redford's first film) won a second Oscar, several more nominations, a primetime Emmy and dozens of other awards.
The documentaries took me many times around the world—to London, Florence and the Outer Hebrides, to Israel, China, Japan and Balad in Iraq. They took me into the lives of renowned musicians like Aaron Copland and Zubin Mehta, famous writers like Ray Bradbury and James Michner and into the lives of fighter pilots who were shot down in Vietnam, Native American activists at Pine Ridge, dozens of playwrights, painters and politicians—along with hundreds of other interesting characters, both ordinary and extraordinary in the many corners of life.
People sometimes express surprise—and I guess I surprise myself, that I've been making movies, and so many movies, for so long—, and they've wondered how I keep up the energy.
Passion. That's really it: It's all about passion.
I've often told people I never really “come alive” unless I'm working on a film project—a project that excites me. It's what keeps me going, gets me out of bed in the morning.
I'm reminded of a scene in The Story of a Fireman, a documentary I made years ago, and the “trick question” always posed in the oral exam of firefighters aspiring to the rank of captain: “What is the most important fire you'll ever respond to?,” the examiner asks. Of course, the answer must be “The next one.”
It's much the same with independent filmmaking. It's a little like you're crossing a stream, stepping from stone to stone. Every time you finish a film, you're out of work, so you look for the next stone, the next film, which becomes “the most important.” You keep moving.
Filmmaking is all about the three “Ps”: passion, perseverance and patience.
Liza, Liza, Skies Are Grey illustrates the patience part. I wrote the script, an original screenplay, in the '60s. When I wrote it, it was a contemporary California motorcycle road trip story of first love based on fragments of my own life, taking place over four days in the turbulent summer of 1966—a time of the Vietnam Draft, the beginnings of the sexual revolution, civil rights confrontations across the country and living in the shadow of the bomb.
The film was going to be the first feature produced under the banner of George Stevens, Jr.'s fledgling American Film Institute, but the anticipated funding fell through and my screenplay sat on a shelf for over 45 years—until my filmmaker daughter, Jessica Sanders, read it and said, “Dad, you should make this.”
I decided Jessica was right, but it would be a challenge. Many of the documentaries I do cost well over a million dollars and they're mostly funded through foundation grants.
Liza required investor funding and for a film without stars, that can be a problem. Moreover, Liza had since become a period piece, now more complicated and expensive to produce with the added costs of recreating long-gone locations and budgeting for vintage vehicles, wardrobe and props. And I only wanted to do Liza if I could make it as an independent theatrical film and have absolute creative control.
As it turned out, three things convinced me it might be possible to make the film, and make it well, for a very modest cost which a few investor friends I had might cover.
First was the newly minted Screen Actors Guild Ultra Low Budget Agreement. If you could make your theatrical film with a production budget of no more than $200,000, the SAG would allow actors to be paid as little as $100 a day—and only for the days actually worked.
Second, digital technology eliminated raw stock and laboratory costs and provided attractive cost-saving possibilities in post-production, particularly for period films. An example: In the ‘60s, all highway center lines were painted white. Today they're yellow. With the '65 Triumph motorcycle shots with Liza and Brett speeding along the Pacific Coast Highway to Big Sur, it was easy to digitally change the center lines from yellow to white.
Third, I had heard of Mark Stolaroff's No Budget Film School, an occasional two-day seminar focusing on low budget production. I decided to attend, thinking I'd probably just hear a lot of stuff I already knew. To my surprise, I was inspired. Seeing so many examples of ultra low budget narrative filmmaking—including portions of a black and white film shot on weekends in London by Christopher Nolan—gave me the decisive push to move forward with Liza.
Films are made up of a thousand moving parts—cast, crew, locations, props, weather, etc.—and for Liza the elements mysteriously and almost magically came together.
Casting always being key, I knew the wrong actor playing Liza would be a disaster. Fortunately, 15-year-old Mikey Madison, newly drawn to becoming an actor, came with their mother to an early audition. It was immediately clear that Mikey was an amazing natural talent and perfect for the role. Some weeks later I discovered another talented young teenager, Sean H. Scully, for the role of Brett.
Erik Daarstad, the great documentary cinematographer with whom I've worked with for many years, came down from Sandpoint, Idaho, to shoot the film and co-produce; Patricia Seely, who gave up a career in aeronautical engineering to go into film signed up as line producer; Justin Kell of Glory Motors, who supplies motorcycles and expertise to $100 million dollar Hollywood action films donated a '65 Triumph to the production along with their services as stunt coordinator and 2nd unit director; an enthusiastic crew of 20 young filmmakers and some recent graduates of film school motivated by the opportunity filled out the team. The cast included 43 speaking parts. Shooting hours were reasonable and civilized, and knowing that a film crew, like an army, travels on its stomach, excellent hot meals were offered every day.
For 25 days over six weeks we shot in 30 locations along the California coast, mostly with available light. Everyone received $100 a day. The film was brought in for $200,000. Liza, Liza, Skies Are Grey is now starting distribution, beginning to find its way, and, hopefully, its audience.
As for me, I'm looking about for the next film. I've been developing Tokyo Rose, a WWII story about Iva Toguri, an American hero who, tragically, in a great injustice, became the first woman in American history to be convicted of treason. I also hope to make a few more music videos. And I'm looking for a contemporary drama—a fresh, important and original story which needs to be told, that I can film in the streets of L.A.
I'm looking for the next stepping stone in the stream. MM

Two people have been arrested following a stabbing in Charleston Friday.
Officers responded to reports of the stabbing at the 2200 block of Garfield Street 2:10 a.m.
Upon arriving, officers made contact with two suspects, Monterio Bussey and Latasha Bussey, the victim and a witness.
According to reports the victim of the stabbing let in two guests at their home on the 2200 block of Garfield Street at 1:45 a.m. and the three of them went to the rear bedroom of the house. The victim is not listed as the homeowner in the incident report.
The homeowner, listed as the witness, didn't like the victim bringing people into their house and they confronted the victim about their guests.
The discussion was reportedly loud enough to gather the interest of Monterio and Latasha, who were also staying in the house. The two went to the bedroom where the guests were and demanded they leave. Latasha and the victim then got into a heated argument.
Monterio came to the aid of Latasha and got involved in an argument by threatening the victim with a crowbar. Monterio then held the victim down on the bed and Latasha stabbed the victim near their right shoulder blade.
The homeowner ran to the back bedroom and began yelling for everyone to stop. Once the homeowner realized they could not get the parties separated, they left the house and went to their sister's house across the street to tell them to call the police.
During the investigation, it was claimed the homeowner also had a knife during the argument.
When asked, the homeowner said due to the weakness in their hands, they carried the knife so that when they knocked on their sister's door, they could use the handle rather than their hands.
Further investigation showed Latasha had a superficial cut on their left forearm, which allegedly occurred after the altercation had finished and was self-inflicted. According to the incident report, the allegation appears to be correct due to the main crime scene taking place in the rear bedroom, and there being another area of blood which leads out of the bedroom used by Monterio.
The witness says Latasha was the primary aggressor after they heard the argument between the witness and the victim.
Both Latasha and Monterio were arrested and Latasha was taken to an area hospital for treatment for the cut on their forearm.

–Aristotle – 384-322BC
Aristotle was a famous Greek philosopher and a scientist.
They were born in 384 BC in the city of Stagira which is in the east of the modern-day Thessaloniki.
Their father died when they were a child so their brother in law, Proxenus of Atarneus, took care of them and even educated them for a couple of years before sending them to Plato‘s Academy.
They studied there till the age of thirty-seven after which they began writing.
Their writings covered almost all subjects that were in human knowledge at that time, ranging from physics to linguistics.
Quite interestingly, they were once invited by Philip II of Macedonia in 343 BC, to tutor their son Alexander who was later to become Alexander the Great.
They were also popular amongst the medieval Muslim scholars who admired them as “The First Teacher”.
Aristotle's views about government and politics are widely studied across the world for they provide a fundamental framework of “good governance”.
In their book “Politics”, Aristotle proposed that for a state to become both best state and most practical, it must have a mixed constitution based upon a combination of democracy and oligarchy.
In such a state, the civil laws must be protected and rulers must not be allowed to use office for their own advantage.
The middle-class must be allowed to rule since they are neither greedy like the rich, nor obedient or jealous like the poor.
They called this the “principle of moderation”.
This principle should be followed in the contemporary world as well if we want to see nations become a harbinger of peace rather than selfishly chasing their national interest.
We have seen how democracies are being run today.
It is not too late to at least try thinking on the lines of Aristotle and incorporating the idea of a mixed constitution into the existing one.
Edmontonians who promote and protect human rights were recognized over the weekend for their efforts.
The 11th annual John Humphrey Centre for Peace and Human Rights Awards was held Sunday.

“It's honouring and recognizing those local heroes in our midst that we maybe don't hear about, that we maybe don't know about, that are every day working on the ground to make people's lives better and to build our community to realize human rights,” John Humphrey Centre executive director Renee Vaugeois said.

Kyle Fairall was a recipient of the Human Rights Champion award. Fairall started Canada's first LGBTQ gym in Edmonton, QueerFlex Canada.
“It's very exciting. It's very humbling to know that the work I've been doing with Queerflex over the last year has had such an impact on folks in the community that they felt important enough or worthy enough to nominate me for an award like this,” they said.

Fairall says there's been a huge flood of people showing interest in the gym. She's now looking for donated space so Queerflex can expand to meet the need.
“The biggest pieces of feedback that folks have been giving is finally there is somewhere that they can go that they can safely explore different parts of themselves when it comes to fitness and wellness,” Fairall said.

For the past 11 years, the awards ceremony has honoured Edmontonians who go above and beyond to help their fellow citizens.
The ceremony was held to commemorate with International Human Rights Day. The declaration of human rights was passed at the United Nations in 1948.
“That was pretty legendary because that was post the Second World War when people were like, ‘We can't like this happens ever again,'” Vaugeois said.
“Now we're coming to 70 years next year for the universal declaration of human rights. I think it's a chance for us to really reflect on have we come very far? How much farther do we have to go?”
A popular reverend is bidding a sad farewell as they get set to take on a new post this summer.
The Reverend Captain Paul Allinson, who has served at Holy Trinity Church in Seaton Carew and St John the Baptist in Greatham, for over a decade will be taking on the role as Vicar of Ponteland, in the Diocese of Newcastle.
The Rev Capt Paul Allinson.
The 53-year-old finished their last Sunday service on June 4 and will take on their new role on Wednesday, July 5, following an induction by the Bishop of Newcastle Christine Hardman.
Paul said: “I have been at Seaton for 14 years and at Greatham for eight years, so it's been hard to say goodbye.
“As you get older change is more difficult and this will be like starting again.
“But I am a North East lad and didn't want to go anywhere else.
“I think it is a big challenge, but I am looking forward to it.
“I have really enjoyed my time at Greatham and Seaton and of course the Hospital of God.”
In their time Paul has seen many changes at the church, supporting a campaign led by parishioners for major renovation work at the Holy Trinity Church.
What followed was a £220,000 restoration programme, completed in 2015, which included stonework, security and lighting, disabled toilets, storage units, and work on the parish centre.
They have also worked at the Hospital of God in Greatham, dedicating time to help the charity which provides high quality care and housing services for older people.
On leaving their post, hundreds of people from Greatham and Seaton came together to hold a farewell party in their honour.
Paul, from Redcar, added: “Time has just flown and I know that if I spend the same length of time in my new role as at my last parish it could be my last one.
“I will particularly miss the people at the Hospital of God and the people of Hartlepool who have a great sense of humour and are so generous.
“People here are very warm and friendly, whoever takes on my role will have a fantastic congregation and community.”
Canada would love nothing more than to take the gold medal on American soil. After the United States defeated the Canadians in the 2017 gold medal game 5-4 in a shootout, their neighbors of the north were in agony to have come so close and just fall so slightly short. To have it happen in hallowed Montreal was even a tougher pill to swallow. To say that there might be old scores to settle in Buffalo is likely an understatement.
As far as Canada is concerned, what is good for the goose is good for the gander. It is their time and opportunity to return the favor to the United States. Tit for tat in its truest sense. Canada has not won a gold medal since 2015. For the rightful birthplace of hockey, that is far too much time to have elapsed. They want gold and they want it in Buffalo.
Goaltending
Canada is one of the few teams to have named more than three goaltenders to their 32-man preliminary roster. At most, only three of those goalies will make the final cut. Michael DiPietro is the odds on favorite of the four possible choices. And why wouldn't they be? The 18-year-old third round selection of the Vancouver Canucks in 2017 has been incredible throughout their junior career with the OHL's Window Spitfires.
Last year, in 2016-17, DiPietro backstopped Windsor to the Memorial Cup championship, and was named the tournament's Most Outstanding Goaltender. At 6-feet and 200 pounds they have near perfect goaltending size. In 51 games last year they had 30 wins, and put up numbers of 2.35 goals against and .917 save percentage. DiPietro may very well be the best of any goaltender in Buffalo.
Carter Hart is one of only seven players from Canada's 2017 junior team that is potentially making a return — it is pretty safe to say that they will. Hart played in four of Canada's seven games last year, including the gold medal loss to the United States. In those four games they were a 2.38 and a .906 in net. The second round selection in the 2016 draft by the Philadelphia Flyers has an incredible 1.32 goals against and a whopping .961 save percentage in 17 games this year with their junior club, the Everett Silvertips of the WHL.
Colton Point and Samuel Harvey are the other two possibilities in net. Harvey has played four straight years with the Rouyn-Noranda Huskies. Each year their save percentage has improved. Currently in 2017-18 Harvey has played in 24 QMJHL games and has a record of 16-4-1, to go with a .921. Point has been remarkable for the NCAA's Colgate Red Raiders. A fifth round selection in 2016 by the Dallas Stars, they presently have a 1.90 goals against and .938 save percentage for Colgate. Point is also a big boy too, at 6-foot-4 and close to 220 pounds.
Defense
You will not find many better defenseman (if any) at this tournament than Jake Bean. One of three blueliners returning from 2017, Bean was the 13th overall selection of the 2016 NHL Draft. The Carolina Hurricanes found themselves a heck of a gem. In their four seasons with the Calgary Hitmen, they have been nearly a point per game defender. 173 points in 186 games to be exact. Bean scored 24 goals from the backend during the 2015-16 WHL season.
Cal Foote would be an ideal selection for this team as well. Much like their Cup-winning father (Adam), the younger Foote plays the same robust, tough-as-nails style. They have the size to back it up too at 6-foot-4 and around the 215-pound mark. Foote was a first round selection (14th overall) by the Tampa Bay Lightning over the summer. Their finest junior season for the WHL's Kelowna Rockets came last season when they tallied 51 assists in 71 games.
Canada has a true giant on their blueline with Logan Stanley, and they are not a gentle one on the ice. At 6-feet-7-inches and over 230 pounds, Stanley could physically manhandle the opposition in Buffalo. Not a force that you want to awaken. Stanley is presently playing for the Kitchener Rangers after coming over from three seasons with the Windsor Spitfires. They have seven goals and 18 assists in 29 games for the Rangers, in addition to 58 penalty minutes. They had 103 PIMS in 64 games for Windsor in 2015-16.
The other defenders up for consideration are Kale Clague (Kings), Dennis Cholowski (Red Wings), Cale Makar (Avalanche), Josh Mahura (Ducks), Dante Fabbro (Predators), Conor Timmins (Avalanche) and Mario Ferraro (Sharks).
Forwards
Michael McLeod, Dillon Dube, and Taylor Raddysh are the three returning forwards from the '17 team. McLeod is a first round draft choice, having been selected 12th overall in 2016 by the New Jersey Devils. Dube and Raddysh also were chosen in 2016 but went in the second round to the Calgary Flames and Tampa Bay Lightning respectively. All three are capable of immense firepower. Raddysh is fresh off of a 109-point season in just 58 games for the Erie Otters in 2016-17. All three will be in Buffalo in 2018. No question.
All of the other possible choices at forward for Canada are just as exciting to put onto this roster. Take Cody Glass for example. Selected sixth overall this summer by the Las Vegas Golden Knights, Glass is just an incredibly intelligent player. They play both ways, thinks steps ahead and is very difficult to strip the puck off of. They already have 20 goals and 28 assists in just 30 games this year for the WHL's Portland Winterhawks. Vegas could very well have drafted the face of their franchise.

Sam Steel is another one of the seemingly endless elite caliber players available to Canada. Steel was taken by the Anaheim Ducks in the first round of the 2016. They have served as an alternate captain for the Regina Pats in 2015-16 and 2016-17, and is presently the team captain this year. Last season, '16-17, they compiled 50 goals and 81 assists in just 66 games.
Any one of the asupervisorstioned players is capable of blossoming into a superstar. They are surrounded by numerous other talents for Canada, including Brett Howden (Lightning), Jordan Kyrou (Blues), Robert Thomas (Blues), Nick Suzuki (Golden Knights), Tanner Kaspick (Blues), Alex Formenton (Senators), Drake Batherson (Senators), Jonathan Ang (Panthers), Maxime Comtois (Ducks), Jonah Gadjovich (Canucks), Boris Katchouk (Lightning), Kole Lind (Canucks), and Tyler Steenbergen (Coyotes). The entire selection of Canada's forwards have been drafted by NHL teams.
The Bottom Line
If they want it badly enough, the gold medal in Buffalo will belong to Canada. They are the most talent-laden team of any nation in the tournament.Team Canada has every aspect of the game covered. Size, firepower, two-way play, hockey smarts, crisp passing. The list could go on, but there is no need — Canada on paper is extremely dominant. But now they need to assemble all of those attributes with the glue of drive and a will to win.
You also need cohesion. While nearly every player on the preliminary roster could be considered a star, the question becomes, “Well, how well do these stars play together?” That remains to be seen. Team Canada coaches and management will need to find the appropriate recipe. If they are able to do so then Canada will be able to claim victory.
Here is THW's prediction as to who makes the final 23-man roster for Canada:
Goaltenders: Michael DiPietro, Colton Point, Carter Hart.
Defense: Cal Foote, Jake Bean, Logan Stanley, Kale Clague, Dante Fabbro, Cale Makar, Dennis Cholowski.
Forwards: Sam Steel, Dillon Dube, Michael McLeod, Cody Glass, Taylor Raddysh, Brett Howden, Robert Thomas, Nick Suzuki, Maxime Comtois, Jonah Gadjovich, Boris Katchouk, Kole Lind, Tyler Steenbergen.
Vibrant young Florida rapper Denzel Curry just dropped a funky new track called “Zeltron 6 Billion” featuring guest work by Lil Ugly Mane. It's no surprise that the FNZ-produced track is a banger; we've been digging Curry's work for awhile now, and just a month ago we ranked the Denzel-collaborated Show Me The Body track “In A Grave” as one of the best songs of the week. Check it out “Zeltron 6 Billion” yourself below.
Curry promises more new music 13 days from now.
"We felt they were going to try to come out and bully us and control the game and come out hard from the start, so we tried to come out with energy," Tillman said. "I thought we did that in the first half. We kept letting them get second-chance rebounds and they were scoring off those."

U2 have revealed a heart-wrenching new short film to coincide with the band's latest single, “You're the Best Thing About Me.”

The documentary about love and separation features a newlywed military couple, high school sweethearts, a Syrian refugee family in Greece and a young couple from Mexico City. The film follows each couple for the final 24 hours they are together before one partner has to leave.
“It's a love song,” explained director Tatia Pilieva of the film. “What's interesting is not the bringing people together; it's the separation.”
Pilieva first came to prominence for their 2014 film First Kiss, where they invited 20 strangers to kiss for the first time on camera. After generating millions of views, it went on to win a Gold Lion at Cannes.
“The key for me is that when these people are saying goodbye, they are still very much in love,” they said of their U2 film. “I didn't want to film a bunch of breakups. I didn't want to put that into the world. I wanted to put out something positive. Yes, it's positively heartbreaking, but there's love all over it.”
Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf Chairman Imran Khan on Wednesday said they met Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Pervez Khattak to expedite the Federally Administered Tribal Areas (Fata) merger process.
“By merging Fata with KP we can reap the benefits from Operation Zarb-e-Azb and National Action Plan,” Imran told reporters following a series of terrorist attacks in Mohmand Agency.
They added that the merger will put an end to the growing menace of terrorism. “Fata is massively underdeveloped and needs to be brought into the mainstream.”
Earlier Wednesday two suicide bombers launched an attack on a government compound in Mohamand tribal area, killing five people and wounding seven others.
"One attacker came by foot and started firing at forces while the other was on a motorbike and rammed into the main gate of the complex," Hamidullah Khattak, an administration official in Mohmand tribal district, told AFP.
The one on foot was shot dead while the second blew themselves up, they said, but not before they managed to kill three tribal police and two civilians. The military confirmed the toll.
Later, police said, another suicide bomber blew themselves up when security forces surrounded them during a search operation in the area.
Wednesday's attacks came two days after a deadly suicide bombing rocked the Punjab provincial capital Lahore, killing at least 13 people and wounding dozens more.
The Taliban faction Jamaat-ul-Ahrar has claimed the attacks in Lahore and Mohmand. Last week the group vowed a fresh wave of assaults on government installations, and a spokesperson told AFP Wednesday the attacks would continue.
In 2014, the military launched a crackdown in the semi-autonomous tribal regions, where militants had previously operated with impunity, leading to a dramatic improvement in security in the country over the last two years.
Islamabad - The Tobacco Control Cell of Ministry of National Health Services, Regulations and Coordination has conducted more than 402 awareness and capacity building sessions for Law Enforcement Agencies (LEAs), authorised persons and general public in which about 12,000 persons have been sensitised and trained.
The cell is taking demand and supply reduction measures to control epidemic of tobacco use in the country.
Tobacco use is a single largest preventable cause of death in the world. In Pakistan, tobacco kills 1,645 men and 442 women every week which is about 298 deaths per day, 2,087 per week and 108,800 per year.
According to Tobacco Atlas, 5th Edition, World Lung Foundation 2015, the diseases caused by tobacco use include lung cancers, heart diseases, stroke and illnesses.
Highlighting the measures adopted by the cell to control tobacco epidemic in the country, official sources on Sunday said these included policy and legislation level interventions, ban on import of Sheesha (tobacco and non-tobacco) and related substances, introduction of pictorial health warning on cigarette packs, ban on tobacco products advertisement in print, electronic and outdoor media and ban on free samples, cash rebates, discounts and sponsorship of events.
Other steps included ban on manufacturing and sale of cigarettes packs having less than 20 cigarette sticks, illegalisation of “Designated Smoking Areas,” and increase in FED on cigarette packs (40.33 per cent increase in FED in last two financial years-44.77 per cent on lower slab and 35.89 per cent on upper slab).
Under infrastructure development and institutionalisation, the sources said that tobacco control cells have been established in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan while Punjab and Sindh have committed the same.
Some other steps included formation of national Technical Advisory Group, formation of technical working group on tobacco taxation, formation and activation of provincial implementation committees/task forces for tobacco control in provinces, formation and activation of district implementation and monitoring committees on tobacco control in model districts and formation of district enforcement teams in model districts.
Moreover, under awareness interventions, the sources said the cell conducted provincial and district implementation committees meetings, launching of two national mass media campaigns – Sponge, 2016 and Tobacco is Hollowing You Out 2015, dissemination of information materials on hazards of tobacco use, second hand tobacco smoke and tobacco control laws (1,157,000 units have been disseminated), installation of plates/posters carrying “Smoking is an Offense” message in ministries, schools, universities, hotels, public service vehicles and other public places and also installation of 200 boards with tobacco control messages at public places in Islamabad.
Similarly, under multifarious awareness interventions, the sources said cell's endeavours included radio and TV programmes, newspaper ads, production and airing of two documentary films in national and regional languages, incorporation of tobacco control messages in curriculum and branding of buses with tobacco control messages in Islamabad and Rawalpindi.
The sources said under enforcement measures, the cell ensured capacity building of law enforcement officers, authorised persons, raids by law enforcement teams and as a result 963 cases have been registered across the country under various sections of 2002 ordinance.

As the general elections are approaching, the estranged PML-N leaders are increasingly talking about their perceived marginalization and political victimization. They are making complaints about pre-poll rigging. They look dissatisfied for not being offered a level playing field ahead of these polls. So they have just pushed a political narrative forward that the Khalai Makhlook (aliens) are trying to render PML-N politically irrelevant in the country thorough ‘political engineering'. Essentially reinforcing this narrative, PML-N ‘supreme leader' Nawaz Sharif has recently said that only PML-N is the target of disqualifications and political victimization in the name of accountability and rule of law while their opponents are getting favoured treatment. Similarly, PML-N president Shahbaz Sharif has been critical of the ‘biased' accountability drive against them and their senior bureaucrats in Punjab though they are also talking about political reconciliation and dialogue. Coincidentally or otherwise, there has been a series of political developments in Pakistan during a year or so which is just strengthening the PML-N's current political narrative.
The troubled PML-N is likely to dispute the credibility and fairness of the forthcoming polls in the country. It would try to make the results of these polls controversial. Though not necessarily justifiable, this political party apparently has many reasons to do this. To begin with, the party's former president Nawaz Sharif was first removed from the premiership by the apex court for not disclosing their ‘unwithdrawn receivables' last year. Later, the ‘supreme leader' was not only disqualified for life to contest elections to become a member of Parliament but was also debarred from heading their own political party. Now a firebrand PML-N leader Daniyal Aziz has been convicted and disqualified in a contempt of court case by the apex court. The troubled party's other prominent leaders like Ahsan Iqbal, Talal Chaudhry and Shahid Khaqan Abbasi are also facing contempt of court proceedings. An election appellate tribunal disqualified former prime minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi from contesting elections from their home constituency. Last week, NAB readily arrested Raja Qamar-ul-Islam, a PML-N candidate in NA-59, over their alleged involvement in Punjab's Saaf Pani Company scam as soon as the party leadership officially announced its nomination in this important National Assembly constituency.
A large number of PML-N's ‘electables' have joined PTI during the last few months. In another mysterious development, a number of PML-N candidates from the Southern Punjab region have announced contesting elections as independent candidates after returning their party tickets. Two months ago, more than a dozen ‘disgruntled' PML-N lawmakers from Southern Punjab, who had formed Junoobi Punjab Suba Mahaz (JPSM), formally merged into PTI to contest upcoming elections under the PTI banner. So PML-N is no more a strong political party in the Southern Punjab region. PML-N candidates are also facing strong criticism and condemnation from a particular religious group for introducing a controversial amendment in Khatm-e-Nabuwwat clause of electoral laws last year. A few days ago, former law minister Zahid Hamid was attacked by a group of similar people while they were going to get electoral symbol from a local Returning Officer in Sialkot district. Earlier, we have also witnessed a number of shoe-throwing incidents targeting various prominent PML-N leaders, including Nawaz Sharif.
Noticeably, PML-N has been the primary victim of the ‘jurisprudence' evolved by the apex court to disqualify any parliamentarian for being not a ‘Sadiq' and ‘Ameen'. Now the provincial High Courts and election tribunals have also started disqualifying legislators on this very ground. Certainly, this ‘sword of disqualification' will be hanging over heads of parliamentarians in the future too. Tehreek Labbaik Pakistan (TLP) is actively participating in the upcoming elections. It has fielded its candidates to contest elections throughout the country. The sudden emergence and rise of TLP in Pakistan have raised many eyebrows. It is believed that this party has been ‘sponsored' to undermine the political strength and relevance of PML-N in the country. It is a fact that the major chunk of the followers and supporters of this party is a particular conservative segment of the society which has been part of the traditional vote-bank of PML-N. TLP is unlikely to make any significant breakthrough in these elections. However, it will certainly minimize the PML-N's prospects for winning these elections.
Nawaz Sharif has also maintained that their party candidates are being pressurized to contest elections in their individual capacity after opting for the election symbol of ‘jeep'. PML-N defectors Chaudhry Nisar Ali and Zaeem Qadri have been allotted a ‘jeep' as their electoral symbol by the ECP. Strangely, PML-N candidates from the Southern Punjab, who have returned their party tickets, are also applying to get ‘jeep' as an electoral symbol. Probably, ‘jeep' and ‘crane' (an electoral symbol allotted to TLP) would help do the desired ‘political engineering' in the country. The electoral symbol of ‘jeep' would soon represent another anti-PML-N electoral alliance.
At the moment, it is almost obvious PML-N won't be in a position to form next government following the upcoming polls. Naturally, it would try to make these polls controversial. It has already rejected the appointment of Dr. Hasan Askri Rizvi as the caretaker Chief Minister of Punjab after formally recording its protest over this issue. Therefore, PML-N leaders would overplay the perceived ‘bias and partisanship' of the superior judiciary, accountability institutions and the caretaker government against them. They would also try to establish a nexus between these state institutions and the military establishment. Moreover, if PML-N, as an electoral political party, collapses altogether before the upcoming polls as a result of ongoing ‘political engineering', it may boycott these polls to avoid a major defeat. Nawaz Sharif has already hinted at boycotting these polls. Indeed, this would be another unfortunate development. This PML-N move would undermine the very credibility and transparency of these polls internationally.
Pakistan is currently facing many grave challenges domestically and internationally. The changing geopolitical dynamics in the region are indeed a matter of serious concern for Pakistan. Low economic growth rate, low revenue collection, high public debt, and rising fiscal and current account deficit continue to plague the country's economy. At this stage, we can by means afford another controversial election accompanied by another prolonged protest and agitation by the opposition political parties. Therefore, the superior judiciary shouldn't excessively exercise its extraordinary jurisdiction to disqualify legislators. NAB and other investigating agencies should also refrain from apprehending contesting candidates until the ongoing electoral process is over. Similarly, the all-powerful military establishment should also try to dilute the impression that it is manipulating politics to the disadvantage of PML-N. PML-N should not be provided an opportunity to dispute the results of forthcoming polls. Indeed, there is no point in doing things which would eventually render these polls controversial.

SEASON 6 PREMIERE
THE AFTERMATH — Oliver (Stephen Amell) deals with the fallout of the explosion on the island. James Bamford directed the episode written by Marc Guggenheim & Wendy Mericle (#601). Original airdate: Thursday, October 12, 2017 @ 9pm
RAHIM YAR KHAN-Traffic remained suspended for 10 hours on Shahi Road between Rahim Yar Khan and Khanpur when the sugarcane farmers blocked the road near Chaudhry Sugar Mills Kot Samaba for restoration of sugarcane crushing.
Hundreds of passengers in cars, buses, trucks and other vehicles faced difficulties from 7:00am when they reached near Chak 86-P where the farmers had blocked the road by parking their tractor-trolleys loaded with sugarcane. The motorists from Khanpur side returned to Sahja while motorists from Rahim Yar Khan side returned to Kot Samaba and adopted 29km alternative route of Latki Bagho Bahar road.
After 2:00pm, the traffic remained stuck at alternative routes as well due to heavy flow on the single road. Some local farmers told this correspondent that sugar mills administration facilitated them for the protest and assured them that after the protest, there will be more chances of restoration of sugarcane crushing operation. However, mostly farmers were worried about their sugarcane and payments.
DC Jamil Ahmed said that the district administration did not close the sugar mills.
They said that AC Rahim Yar Khan and AC Khanpur with DSP traffic were at the spot and making arrangements to restore the traffic on Shahi road.
When AC RYK Dr Adnan Khan Bhitani was questioned that why district administration has failed to control the protestors and restore the traffic, they replied that they were in the city and going to the spot.
They further said that the administration could not manage the protestors forcefully but they instructed Ac Khanpur and DSP traffic to rush to the spot for peaceful negotiations with protestors They said that farmers were being diverted to Hamza Sugar mills and Ittehad Sugar Mills to sell their sugarcane.
SHO Kot Samaba Malik Manzoor Ghiuoor Abbas was present at Chak 86-P. However, the traffic was restored at 5:30pm when the farmers voluntarily removed their tractor-trolleys from the Shahi road.
British counterterrorism police were investigating Wednesday after two people were left in critical condition, exposed to an unknown substance a few miles from where a former Russian spy and their daughter were poisoned with a nerve agent.
The Wiltshire Police force declared a “major incident” after a man and a woman in their 40s were hospitalized after being found unconscious Saturday at a residential building in Amesbury, eight miles (13 kilometres) from Salisbury, where Sergei and Yulia Skripal were poisoned on March 4.
London's Metropolitan Police force said “given the recent events in Salisbury,” counterterrorism officers were working with local police on the investigation. British media reported that samples of the mystery substance had been sent to the Portdon Down defence research laboratory for testing.
Police cordoned off a home and other places the two people visited before falling ill, including a nearby church and a pharmacy, but health officials said there was not believed to be a wider risk to the public.

A major incident is a designation allowing British authorities to mobilize more than one emergency agency.
The emergency services' response echoes that in the case of the Skripals, whose illness initially baffled doctors after they were found unconscious on a park bench in Salisbury. Scientists at Porton Down concluded they had been poisoned with Novichok, a type of nerve agent developed by the Soviet Union during the Cold War.
Britain accuses Russia of poisoning the Skripals, a claim Moscow strongly denies. The poisoning sparked a Cold War-style diplomatic crisis between Russia and the West, including the expulsion of hundreds of diplomats from both sides.

The two Amesbury victims were being treated at Salisbury District Hospital, where the Skripals spent weeks in critical condition.
Police said authorities initially believed the latest victims might have taken a contaminated batch of heroin or crack cocaine.
“However, further testing is now ongoing to establish the substance which led to these patients becoming ill and we are keeping an open mind as to the circumstances surrounding this incident,” police said in a statement. “At this stage, it is not yet clear if a crime has been committed.”
Sergei Skripal, 67, is a former Russian intelligence officer who was convicted of spying for Britain before coming to the U.K. as part of a 2010 prisoner swap. They had been living quietly in Salisbury, a cathedral city 90 miles (145 kilometres) southwest of London, when they were struck down along with their 33-year-old daughter Yulia, who was visiting him.
Residents of the street at the centre of the Amesbury investigation – in a quiet neighbourhood of newly built houses and apartments – said they had received little information about the unknown substance from authorities.
“Amesbury's a lovely place – it's very quiet, uneventful,” said Rosemary Northing, who lives a couple of hundred yards (meters) away from the cordoned-off building. “So for this to happen, and the media response and the uncertainty, it's unsettling.”

Neighbours said police cars and fire engines descended on the home late Saturday. Student Chloe Edwards said they saw people in “green suits” – like those worn by forensics officers – and their family was told to stay inside their home for several hours.
“We wanted to know what happened. And with the Russian attack happening not long ago, we just assumed the worst,” said Edwards.
Among the sites cordoned off was a Baptist church where the victims attended a community event on Saturday. Church secretary Roy Collins said about 200 people were at the neighbourhood event, but “nobody else has suffered any ill-effects.”
Police from 40 departments in England and Wales had just returned home in June after months of working on the Skripals' poisoning. Wiltshire Police spent about 7.5 million pounds ($13 million CAD) dealing with the aftermath of the Skripals' poisoning and believe that their front door was contaminated with the nerve agent.
Doctors who treated the Skripals say they have made a remarkable recovery but they still don't know what the long-term prognosis is.
The Skripals have been taken to an undisclosed location for their protection.
A convoy of modern American built Harley-Davidson motorbikes is a novel sight on Cuba's roads with tourists roaring through Havana to start an island tour organized by the son of one of the country's most influential figures.

The man behind the operation and tour leader is Ernesto Guevara, the youngest son of the revolutionary icon Che Guevara, whose giant image looks down on Havana's Revolution Square.
“As a child, I always liked motorbikes, cars and speed. I was able to join up with a friend to turn something we liked into a business,” said Guevara, adding that they want people to learn about their country and its culture.
Ernesto Guevara is a lawyer by training, but they gave the profession up to run their bike business along with their wife who handles the bookings and occasionally joins them on the tours. They attract biking enthusiasts from all around the world, including an increasing number coming from the United States.
“No one can deny the place of Che Guevara in Latin American history. It's a fascinating story and to see it unfold through the eyes now of Che's family and go to those places, it's an experience to not miss,” said Ken Wallentine, a motorbike enthusiast from the US.
There are two tour options with a six-day or a lengthier nine-day Cuba tour on offer. Prices range from around 3,000 to 6,000 US dollars. So far, there's been no shortage of takers.

Ernesto Guevara‘s company is called La Poderosa Tours and is named after the motorbike their father rode as a young man on their epic journey through South America.
That journey was immortalized in the Oscar award-winning movie ‘The Motorcycle Diaries' in 2004. Based on their memoirs, the film followed the young Che and their friend on their voyage of discovery around South America before going on to become a Marxist revolutionary.
DETROIT (AP)  A new study finds roughly half of those enrolled in Michigans Medicaid program since its expansion have jobs and another quarter unemployed are likely to be in poor health.
Authors of the study released Monday by the University of Michigan Institute for Healthcare Policy and Innovation say the findings raise concerns about work requirements for Medicaid enrollees. The Trump administration urges states to consider changes to Medicaid programs to encourage work and independence and some have asked for work requirements or other waivers.
Lead author Renuka Tipirneni asks if screening and tracking enrollees are worthwhile when a minority arent employed and are potentially able to work.
The peer-reviewed study is based on surveys of about 4,000 people enrolled in Michigans program. The findings were published in JAMA Internal Medicine.

* THROUGH UNIT ENTERED LOI WITH COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL PLANNING, & SEPARATE DEEDS OF AGREEMENT WITH FINANCIAL WISDOM & COUNT FINANCIAL​ Source text for Eikon: Further company coverage:
Since the November elections, we've seen unprecedented numbers of Americans speaking out on public policy. Voters want to influence their lawmakers on high-stakes issues from healthcare to climate change, education to immigration, foreign affairs to trade policy. The question, for many, is how to communicate effectively, especially when Washington sometimes seems impervious to the average citizen.
Between us, we've spent 80 years working in Congress and we know something about effective constituent communications. There are a handful of unwritten rules that can amplify your voice in these tempestuous times.
Every year, concerned groups and individuals flock to Washington to make their case on Capitol Hill. That's worthwhile, but there is an easier way, and one that may give you an even better chance of meeting face to face not with a staffer but with your senator and Congress member themselves.
Check the “full calendar” listings on Web pages for the House and Senate — or use the portal at the Library of Congress website www.congress.gov — to see when a district or state “work period” is scheduled (one begins this weekend). That means your representatives will be in their home districts.
Argue your position clearly and simply, and be very specific about what you expect the legislator to do. ... Keep the small talk brief and the meeting short.
Call your representative's local office to find out when and where they or they will be holding office hours, touring schools and businesses, and holding town hall meetings. Then call the legislator's D.C. office — the operator at 202-224-3121 can connect you — and request a meeting in the district office. Be respectful but persistent; if your representatives can't see you during the upcoming district or state work period, when can they?
Make sure to explain that you are a constituent; politicians do not enjoy long careers if they snub their voters. Request a ten-minute meeting. Be clear about the topic and be flexible about when you can meet.
Assemble a small group of voters of various backgrounds who share your concerns and have expertise to share. If you want to advocate for or against an education matter, include a representative of a teacher's group, PTA parents, special education advocates; if healthcare is your issue, bring along a doctor, a hospital administrator, or a patient advocate.
Know the status of the issue or the bill in question. Is it in committee; is it scheduled for the floor? Again, the Library of Congress website can help. Demonstrating knowledge of the legislative process will make your discussion more effective.
Argue your position clearly and simply, and be very specific about what you expect the legislator to do. Don't issue threats or be confrontational. Keep the small talk brief and the meeting short; former Rep. Morris K. Udall (D-Arizona) used to complain about meetings that go on and on because “everything has been said, but not everyone has said it.” Choose your best spokesperson to make the case, take a picture, and say thank you.
If you can't be part of a face-to-face meeting, calls, emails, texts, tweets and other communication can be effective. Follow the same rules as above: Be courteous, clear and brief, and always say what action you support. Despite public skepticism, legislators do pay attention when the calls and messages roll in; and don't forget letters to the editor, again co-signed by a diverse a group of constituents.
Consider a media strategy: You may be able to arrange to speak with reporters after a meeting to describe what your group requested and the response. And show up at the legislator's town halls or other public appearances: Sometimes, questions and issues need to be raised in public.
A key rule of politics is to assume nothing. You may think you know how your representative will vote, but it never hurts to weigh in to make sure. If your perspective is not heard and the other side's is, the legislator may feel pressured to cast a vote you would never have anticipated. Besides, politicians like to hear from supporters.
Follow-up is crucial as well; if you are granted a meeting, send a thank-you note immediately that reiterates your request. No matter how cordial the encounter, never presume you have persuaded anyone. The other side has cordial meetings, too.
Continue to make calls and send emails as the issue is debated and the vote nears. No matter what happens, send another note: a thank you if you got the result you wanted, or a civil note of deep disappointment. Always maintain open communications and good relations; in politics, today's adversary is the crucial ally you may need on another issue.
You can extend your influence by joining or volunteering with advocacy organizations. Our suggestion: Throw your lot in with groups that have proven records of success rather than newly minted, single-issue start-ups.
You don't need to have been in politics for decades to know that you win some and you lose some. We hope this advice will help you win more often than you lose in this critical period for our country.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Asian shares fell on Tuesday as investors dumped high-flying U.S. technology shares on fears of stiffer regulation as Facebook came under fire following reports it allowed improper access to user data.

The retreat came as investors braced for new Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell's first policy meeting starting later in the day and amid concerns that U.S. President Donald Trump could impose additional protectionist trade measures.
MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan .MIAPJ0000PUS dropped 0.2 percent. Japan's Nikkei .N225 fell 1.0 percent.
On Wall Street the S&P 500 .SPX lost 1.42 percent and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC 1.84 percent, both suffering their worst day in five weeks.
“Investors lightened their positions ahead of the Fed's policy meeting. The markets are completely split on whether the Fed will project three rate hikes this year or four,” said Hiroaki Mino, senior strategist at Mizuho Securities.
Facebook (FB.O) led the losses, tumbling 6.8 percent as the social media colossus faced demands from U.S. and European lawmakers to explain how a consultancy that worked on President Donald Trump's election campaign gained improper access to data on 50 million Facebook users.
In addition, worries about the potential for a U.S.-China trade war cast a shadow after U.S. President Trump imposed tariffs on steel and aluminium and suggested punitive tariffs on some $60 billion worth of Chinese information technology, telecoms and consumer products annually.
The sharp fall in share prices put a lid on long-term U.S. bond yields while short-dated yields rose ahead of an expected rate hike from the U.S. Federal Reserve after its two-day policy meeting starting on Tuesday.
The yield on 10-year Treasuries was 2.845 percent US10YT=RR, little changed on the week and about 10 basis points below the four-year high of 2.957 percent touched a month ago.
But the yield on two-year notes US2YT=RR hit a 9 1/2-year high of 2.32 percent as the Fed appears set to bump up its policy interest rates USFFTARGET= to 1.50-1.75 percent from the current 1.25-1.50 percent.
But with a Fed rate rise already fully priced in, the dollar barely gained from the prospect of a rate hike. Instead it was the euro that stole the spotlight after Reuters reported that European Central Bank officials were shifting their debate from bond purchases to the expected path of interest rates.
The euro EUR= rose to $1.2338, bouncing back from $1.2258 hit the previous day.
The British pound GBP=D4 hit one-month high of $1.4088 after Britain and the European Union agreed to a 21-month post-Brexit transition period and a potential solution to avoid a "hard border" for Northern Ireland.
It was last at $1.4024.
The yen was little changed at 106.01 per dollar JPY=.
Oil prices barely moved as investors remained wary of growing crude supply although tensions between Saudi Arabia and Iran provided some support.
Brent crude futures LCOc1 traded at $66.19 a barrel. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) futures CLc1 were $62.16 a barrel.
LAHORE - Punjab Chief Minister Shehbaz Sharif has said that there will be politics of progress of the country and prosperity of the people in 2017 and it is the year of completion of promises and projects.
“The journey of progress and prosperity, the foundation of which has been laid in 2016, will be speedily forwarded in 2017,” they said while talking to a delegation of PML-N yesterday.
They said that under the leadership of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, the rapid development made in different sectors during last year in the tenure of PML-N government was unprecedented.
Development projects including energy projects are being executed speedily with high standard, they added. Shehbaz Sharif said that various projects were also being completed rapidly under China Pakistan Economic Corridor.
They said that work was being carried out round the clock on 1320-Megawatt Coal Power Project in Sahiwal and it will be completed in the beginning of next year.
The chief minister said that in the present situation there will be politics of progress and prosperity and not that of agitation and anarchy. People wanted to create hurdles in the development and prosperity of the people and the country through jugglery will fail in future like before, they added.
The chief minister said that conscious people of Pakistan, by renouncing protest politics, have exposed a handful of political elements and the politics of allegations, lies and protests has died its own death.
They said that the people wanted to create hurdles in the way of progress and prosperity of the masses have become politically isolated. There is a need for enemies of progress and prosperity to review their attitude, they added. They said that people of Pakistan want only progress, prosperity and peace.
Shehbaz Sharif said that there is no value of personal interests before the interests of Pakistan and PML-N had always done the politics of norms. They said that all have to move jointly for the development and prosperity of the country and achieve the lost destiny of the nation. They said that 2017 will be the year of completion of projects.
CONDEMNS TERROR INCIDENT IN ISTANBUL
Punjab Chief Minister Shehbaz Sharif has strongly condemned the incident of terrorism in Istanbul, Turkey. They have expressed deep sense of sorrow and grief over loss of human lives in the incident and prayed for early recovery of the injured.
The chief minister expressed complete solidarity with Turk leadership and people and strongly condemned the incident of terrorism. Shehbaz Sharif said that they are grieved over loss of precious human lives. They said that people of Pakistan especially Punjab are with their Turk brethren in this hour of distress and equally share the grief of the bereaved families.
All our sympathies are with the bereaved families, they added. The Chief Minister said that Turkey and Pakistan are facing the menace of terrorism and undoubtedly, terrorism is an international challenge which will have to be coped with joint efforts and take steps in a coordinated manner for eliminating this scourge.
Trucker Path, a three-year-old, Mountain View-based platform that helps connect drivers, brokers, shippers, and carriers, has just lined up $30 million in debt funding so it can start loaning some of those truckers money right after they deliver their freight.
It's seemingly a win-win. It means truckers needn't wait 30 to 60 days to get paid by the vendors who hire them. In the meantime, the loans are a new revenue opportunity for Trucker Path, which is charging its customers slightly more in interest than it's paying its two debt providers: Silicon Valley Bank and Flexible Funding, a lower-flying, 25-year-old lending institution in San Francisco.
It's the latest twist in the war to win over the hearts of the 1.6 million long-haul truckers in the U.S., a somewhat stunning 550,000 of whom are already using Trucker Path's app, according to cofounder and CEO Ivan Tsybaev.
Why do they use it? Well, partly to communicate to their peers where parking is, and isn't available. In fact, it's one of the stickiest features of the app, which began as a navigational tool but now features everything from crowdsourcing to the ability to track shipments from dispatch to delivery.
While people outside the industry might not grasp what a pain in the butt it is to park a truck, a survey by the Department of Transportation has shown that 75 percent of drivers say they regularly have trouble finding a safe place to park when they need to rest. Using Trucker Path, drivers save 11 hours, or $600, each month, insists Tsyvaev. Meanwhile, you can imagine the savings for enterprise customers like Pepsi and FedEx that send out thousands of trucks every day.
Trucker Path isn't their only option, of course. You've probably read about the growing spate of startups looking to elbow aside traditional trucking companies, including Turvo, which we wrote about here, and Uber Freight — a freight broker that's eventually expected, like Trucker Path, to offer a single platform where brokers, shippers, and carriers can work together in real time.
But Tsyvaev says their company already has the kind of network effect that can mean the difference between barely surviving and thriving, and investors apparently buy their argument. The 30-person company — which has already raised $21.5 million from Renren and Wicklow Capital of Chicago, among others — says it's right now talking with investors about a Series B round and that it's already fielding term sheets.
The new funding should help on a number of fronts. One new feature the company has been working on is an insurance marketplace for its trucking customers; they'll gain access to numerous providers that would otherwise have trouble connecting with these individuals but can reach them more easily with Trucker Path's help.
Trucker Path also says it wants to beef up its enterprise sales force, and to create a fully automated marketplace, so truckers don't have to worry about negotiating with shippers or freight brokers. Indeed, ultimately, says Tsyvaev, a trucker will be able to tell Trucker Path's app how long they'll be on the road, and it'll will immediately provide them or them with the “right freight at the right price.”
Then, thanks to its new debt facility, it can give that person a cash advance. Speaking of which, new equity funding will also come in handy on that front. As Tsyvaev explains it, the company's debt lenders provide only a partial advance rate, meaning that for every invoice, they pay 92 percent and Trucker Path covers 8 percent.
“To scale into a multi-billion dollar business,” says Tsyvaev, and naturally it means to, “we need more capital.”
LONDON (Reuters) - Some trains were canceled, flights were grounded and a rugby match was called off on Sunday after Britain experienced heavy snow fall in some areas.
Britain's Met Office said there was an “amber weather warning” particularly across central England and warned travelers that “road, rail and air travel delays are likely, as well as stranding of vehicles and public transport cancellations”.
There were 28 centimeters of snow in Sennybridge, in Wales, and 12 centimeters in High Wycombe, just outside the capital London.
Flights were suspended in Birmingham in central England, while more than 10 train lines reported delays. A rugby match in London was postponed due to “adverse weather conditions surrounding the ground”.
JAKARTA (Reuters) - Thousands protested outside the U.S. Embassy in the Indonesian capital on Sunday against U.S. President Donald Trump's decision to recognise Jerusalem as Israel's capital, many waving banners saying “Palestine is in our hearts”.
Leaders in Indonesia, home to the world's largest Muslim population, have joined a global chorus of condemnation of Trump's announcement, including Western allies who say it is a blow to peace efforts and risks sparking more violence.
Thousands of protesters in Muslim-majority countries in Asia have rallied in recent days to condemn the U.S. move.
Israel maintains that all of Jerusalem is its capital. Palestinians want East Jerusalem as the capital of a future independent state and say Trump's move has left them completely sidelined.
Palestinian people were among the first to recognise Indonesia's independence in 1945, Sohibul Iman, president of the controversial Islamist opposition Prosperous Justice Party which organised the rally, told protesters.

Indonesia should be more proactive in “urging the Organisation of Islamic Conference (OIC) member states and U.N. Security Council and the international community to respond immediately with more decisive and concrete political and diplomatic actions in saving the Palestinians from the Israeli occupation and its collaborator, the United States of America,” Iman said.
“Indonesia as the world's largest Muslim country has the largest responsibility toward the independence of Palestine and the management of Jerusalem,” they told reporters, adding that they hoped Indonesia would take a leading role within the OIC on the matter.

“Trump has disrupted world peace. It's terrible,” one protester, Yusri, told Reuters.
The decision was “a major disaster for the Palestinian people, while the Palestinian's own rights have been taken away for a long time,” said Septi, a student at the rally.
Violence erupted for a third day in Gaza on Saturday in response to Trump's decision, which overturned decades of U.S. policy towards the Middle East.
Indonesia's foreign minister left for Jordan on Sunday to meet the Palestinian and Jordanian foreign ministers “to convey Indonesia's full support for Palestine”.
After half a century driving semitrucks, Charles Oaks, 71, developed a strategy to stave off fatigue during 14-hour days on the road.
They drink cups of coffee and unsweetened tea, and, most importantly, takes a rest stop every four hours.
“I am going to take the stops so I can travel safely,” the Idaho-based driver said while sitting in their truck, parked near a McDonald's in Vernon.
Some truck drivers in California, however, may not be able to rest as often as Oaks does if controversial House legislation under consideration this summer becomes law.
A provision in a House appropriations bill would allow federal regulations to exempt truck drivers who cross California boundaries from the state's strict meal and rest requirements.
California law requires truck drivers — along with other state employees — to take a 30-minute meal break in their first five hours on shift, and another break when five more hours have passed. Employees must also take a paid 10-minute rest break every four hours of working.
Several other states, including Colorado and Kentucky, require similar rest breaks of their employees.
Federal regulations, on the other hand, require only that drivers take one 30-minute break in their first eight hours of driving.
Some officials in California are concerned that fewer breaks under the federal rules would lead to sleepier drivers, who often work exhausting 10-hour shifts. And they fear that could mean more accidents.
“They are putting in policy measures that ultimately diminish truck safety,” said Harry Adler, a spokesperson at the Truck Safety Coalition, a national advocacy organization. “In this bill they are going in and trying to preempt states that want to go above and beyond in terms of providing meal and rest breaks.”

Los Angeles County alone saw 8,989 collisions, fatal and nonfatal, involving large trucks in 2016, according to data from the California Highway Patrol. There were about 15,000 big rig crashes in the entire state last year, or 38 collisions per 100,000 people.
The provision was introduced by Rep. David Valadao (R-Hanford) and originally crafted by Rep. Jeff Denham (R-Turlock) in proposed legislation from 2015. Denham has received more than $60,000 in contributions from truck organizations and political action committees for their reelection campaigns, according to federal election commission data.
Leaders of trucking companies, who generally support the provision, bemoan the frequency with which California drivers are required to rest, arguing that such stops disrupt drivers' routes.
The patchwork of different state rules causes confusion for interstate drivers, industry leaders argue.
“It's just bizarre the way… this plays out in the real world,” said Bill Sullivan, executive vice president of advocacy at American Trucking Assns. “You couldn't have 50 states of meal and rest breaks.”
Sullivan believes the rule change would streamline truck breaks for interstate drivers and, in effect, improve the safety of truck drivers, who they said sometimes have to make dangerous decisions when pulling over for brief, mandated rests.
Opponents, however, charge that truck companies are looking to prioritize profits and delivery time over the safety of their workers.
The law would only affect the companies that operate in other states in addition to California. It's unclear what percentage of truckers fall under this category. But opponents of the provision point to a potential loophole — some truckers for interstate companies only drive within California.
Some advocates worry that companies would pressure truckers into taking fewer breaks than California requires.
“Human beings have breaking points,” said Samuel Loesche, legal representative for the International Brotherhood of Teamsters. “The people who are advocating these proposals are playing a dangerous game in testing those breaking points.”
The Federal Motor Carrier Administration, which issues federal truck-driving regulations, declined to comment on the pending legislation.
The debate over the federal government's right to supersede states' rest regulations is a decade old, consisting of petitions and lawsuits that for the most part uphold longstanding state labor law.
In 2008, a group of truck companies petitioned the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration to recognize federal law as preempting state regulations, but the agency rejected that request.
Similarly, then-State Assemblyman Michael Duvall introduced an amendment bill in 2008 that would exempt truck drivers from state meal and rest break requirements — but that bill died in committee.
In 2014, the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that federal regulations could not preempt state labor law when it upheld a lawsuit filed on behalf of drivers, who alleged their company Penske Logistics did not allow them to take state-mandated rest breaks.
In that case, the federal Department of Transportation filed an amicus brief supporting the drivers and reaffirming longstanding state labor laws.
Most recently, Denham in 2015 introduced a similar rest stop amendment to a House bill, but the provision ultimately died in the Senate.
“It's kind like the zombie bill,” said Rome Aloise, the president of Teamsters Joint Council 7, noting that the debate resurfaces every few years.
While some believe a rule change could endanger drivers, Florida trucker Daimon LaFreniere, 23, sees the federal regulations as a positive.
After parking their semitruck in the Vernon McDonald's, LaFreniere posited that California's requirement that drivers make frequent stops could be detrimental to truck drivers paid by the mile.
“That's too many stops,” they said.
They and their driving partner, Nick Hastings, 22, switch off at the steering wheel when the other becomes tired. The days are long, but they don't mind.
After all, LaFreniere said, “When the truck's moving, we're getting paid.”
Oaks, however, believes the stops are non-negotiable. They wouldn't alter their rest stops if the bill passed.
“I made it this far,” Oaks said as they prepared to start a four-hour drive to El Centro last month. “I'm going to keep on going.”

New Brunswick's emergency measures organization (EMO) says though flooding potential over the St. John River is “mainly steady,” there's still a possible concern for people in the Jemseg, N.B. area.
READ MORE: New Brunswick emergency officials remind people to stay vigilant about flooding
Robert Duguay with the EMO told Global News that water levels in the community were going to go above flood stage for the rest of the week.
“Water levels in Fredericton-area reached a peak last Friday. Now it's Jemseg, and what I'm saying is it's all regions on the way down, up to the Bay of Fundy for the St. John River will see an increase of water levels, of course naturally, and then eventually that will decrease,” Duguay said.
“What we're seeing here is there's no other major threat in terms of a lot of precipitation or snow melting or ice, so we think that water levels should stay pretty steady and decrease everywhere.”
They said some of the roads are halfway covered, but as only half of the street is water-filled, the organization feels no major roads will be closed.
Stewart Upton, who has lived along the St. John River, told Global News the uncertain water levels can be a concern, but is used to it.
“They're high but they can be a lot worse,” they said. “I've lived here all my life and we get flooded every three or four years.”
They said, typically, when flooding is possible, they pick up everything that could float away, and then gets to high ground.
With the potential for flooding this week, they said every person in the community deals with it differently.
“Everybody has a different feeling. Some of the old guys, they're pretty well-prepared, and some of the new people don't know what to expect, so it's no fun,” Upton said.
“Once it comes over the road, then it gets interesting, but as long as it stays on that side of the road, it's not too bad.”
Though rain is expected later this week, and the possibility of rain and snow next weekend, Duguay said they expect water levels to increase along the river, then decrease. They also said there's no more issues with ice in the upper part of the St. John River basin.
“So at this point, we are watching carefully any rain coming,” they said. “By that time [next weekend], the water levels will decrease enough to be able to take any additional rain that we could get.”
They added the water levels in the Fredericton area reached a peak Friday.
Piaget's Altiplano 60th Anniversary Pocket Watch Takes Your Breath Away
To be honest, that's exactly the effect this watch had for me. Upon a first glance, the Piaget Altiplano 60th Anniversary Pocket watch will take your breath away and leave you in a state of awe. The 60th anniversary of the brand's most emblematic collection seemed like the proper reason to introduce a new pocket watch, that sums up the classic design and takes it into the future.
Few companies are still producing pocket watches right now, that's why the Altiplano 60th Anniversary Pocket Watch deserves even more attention and praise from us. The shape, its chic blue dial, and the impressive movement may all be familiar to us, but there is a mysterious appeal about the end result and no one tries to explain it. Sometimes no answer is better than the wrong one.
The marvelous Altiplano before you shows off a 50 mm 18k white gold case, keeping in line with the design codes of the collection and its slender roots. A gold buckle and a blue calfskin string and pouch add to the overall appeal and make this watch the proper gentleman's companion – nothing but the best attention to detail and incredible craftsmanship should complement an educated and stylish man.
The dial of the Piaget Altiplano 60th Anniversary Pocket Watch features a very clean look, with a sunburst pattern and sleek baton markers and hands. The ultra-thin self-winding mechanical calibre 1200P is visible through the sapphire caseback, showing off its 22k blackened micro-rotor and its functional magic, backed up by a 44-hour power reserve.
In the end, we should mention that only 26 units of the Piaget Altiplano 60th Anniversary Pocket Watch will be ever produced, with pricing yet to be announced.
"There is a potential for golf ball sized hail, heavy winds up to 58 miles per hour, and there is a potential for a tornado,"
"There is a potential for golf ball sized hail, heavy winds up to 58 miles per hour, and there is a potential for a tornado,"
Early this afternoon we have received new information from the Storm Prediction Center (SPC); they have released a new convective outlook ahead of the today's severe weather threat.
Partial sunshine so far today has helped warm our temperatures a bit... it is also helping to build instability values for later today. SPC has upgraded parts of north Alabama into a "Moderate Risk" while keeping many of our central/south Alabama counties under a Marginal, Slight and even now an Enhanced risk.
High resolution model guidance open our window for strong storms to start later this afternoon. Isolated super-cellular development starts in our far southern/east counties where coverage will be limited, but impactful for those who see storms.
While overall coverage is limited, if this cell do develop they'll likely become strong to severe with large hail, damaging winds and perhaps a tornado or two.
It's important to stress that not everyone will see storms today, and some of you won't even see rain. Sounds silly, but coverage of storms will not be widespread, nor will they impact our entire viewing area. For those of you who do see the wet weather and stronger storms, know that each cell has the potential to pack a punch. We encourage you to remain weather aware this afternoon into the night. We'll have continuing coverage throughout the day and frequent updates as conditions warrant.
MAKE SURE YOU'RE PREPARED!
You still have time to make sure you're prepared for severe storms. Make sure you have multiple, reliable ways to receive weather updates. A NOAA weather radio and the WSFA First Alert Weather App are great choices. DO NOT rely on an outdoor warning siren. They are meant for anyone outside to get inside, they ARE NOT meant to be heard inside.
Thunderstorm development during this time remains debatable. But the setup is there for severe weather, so any development should it occur would grow quickly.
The second window develops after dark along a broken line that will ignite close to the I-20 corridor. This wave is likely the "main event" for much of north Alabama where the overall severe weather threat is maximized. This activity will slide southeast tonight and into the early hours of Tuesday morning. The flow and dynamics involved by this point lend me to think any severe weather issues for us would mainly center around hail and gusty winds. But a tornado can't be ruled out.
Hail is likely to be the greatest overall threat for us, given ample instability and relatively dry/cool air aloft. Golf ball to tennis ball sized hail will be possible within the most intense cores of thunderstorms.
The tornado threat is the greatest across north Alabama where wind profiles will be maximized for updraft rotation. Our tornado threat remains somewhat conditional, but there appears to be at least some risk for tornadoes within cells able to tap into locally enhanced shear. Low level flow is not ideal for tornado development, but our significant instability could be able to compensate somewhat. Bottom line, this is not a tornado outbreak setup. But the setup taken as a whole may be sufficient for a tornado risk.
Make sure you know where to go when severe weather strikes. Have a plan, know your plan and go over your plan. Remember in the event of a tornado, go to the lowest floor of your home, the innermost room away from winds. Have a helmet, pillow or anything else that would protect your head. If you live in a mobile home making plans to wait out the storms in a storm shelter or a site built structure. Continue to stay updated as we continue to provide updates and tweaks to the forecast.

Hikers and tourists trying to access the shortest, easiest trail route to the Hollywood sign will find it is closed.
Starting Tuesday, a portion of Griffith Park at the Beachwood Drive gate will be closed to the public due to a recent court order that required the city to allow access to Sunset Ranch Hollywood Stables. Tourists and hikers will need to find another route to get their Hollywood sign selfies.
Rose Watson, parks department spokesperson, had said the city would redirect pedestrians to Canyon Drive and other access points to the Griffith Park trails, including the popular Hollyridge Trail.
The legal battle over access began when the Griffith Park horseback riding facility complained the city was channeling hikers onto its “exclusive easement road” and had advertised that pedestrians could access the area using a new gate.
In February, a Los Angeles County Superior Court judge found the city had blocked access to the ranch and interfered with its use by directing thousands of pedestrians toward the property every month.
The judge also found hikers could not be barred from using the Sunset Ranch easement. They said the city could allow pedestrians to access Hollyridge Trail at the beginning of the easement or another access point that was previously used but is currently blocked.
In March, the city agreed to spend $100,000 to study park access and mobility, including viewing of the Hollywood sign, near the western side of Griffith Park.
“For too long, the city and the community have been bogged down in litigation, shifting problems from one neighborhood to the next,” City Councilman David Ryu, who represents the area, said in a statement. “We need to improve the visitor experience for park users, quality of life for our neighbors, and most importantly, the public safety for all.”

Being a fan of cricket it is really glad to mention that the New Zealand's women's team posted the highest score in any one-day international by putting a mammoth target of 490 against Ireland in Dublin. Let me clear that New Zealand's captain Suzie Bates won the toss and decided to bat first where their 151 runs and Madeline Green 121 runs helped the team to put the target of 490 runs on scored board also helped the team to defeat the against team by 346.
According to a report in this newspaper New Zealand break their own 21-year-old record women's ODI total of 455-5, also made in 50 overs, against Pakistan at Christchurch in 1997 and the news further disclosed that also the team break down the record of 444 runs of England's men team which was made against Pakistan at Trent Bridge, Nottingham, in 2016. It is time to feel proud and congratulate the for making this unbelievable target and I wish the team best of luck for future. A fan will be happy when such kind of great performance will be observed since a fan always wait for it. For me as a fan of cricket the moment was not less than a festival since such kind of game encourages and boost up the young people to support any games to make it no one sport of the world.
BAKHTIYAR PHULLAN,
Kech, June 10.
A police chief says measures are in place in Hartlepool to protect potential victims of child sex abuse and go after perpetrators.
Chief Superintendent Alastair Simpson, of Cleveland Police, outlined measures in place to the Safer Hartlepool Partnership.
It was in response to a question from Fens and Rossmere Councillor Jim Lindridge in the light of the sex abuse scandal in Newcastle which resulted in the convictions of 17 men and one woman.
Under-age girls and vulnerable young women were taken to parties in the city and plied with drugs before being raped and sexually abused.
Chf Supt Simpson told the partnership that Cleveland Police had a dedicated Child Sexual Exploitation (CSE) team to investigate reports and carry out pro-active work.
They said: “We are working with safeguarding boards for some time to make sure we have got structures in place to protect young people at risk of CSE.
“There are good structures in place in Hartlepool. We respond to all intelligence about CSE.
“There is a Tees-wide group and plan to look at protecting young people who may be victims of child sexual exploitation, trafficking or go missing.
“We do have the machinery to make sure we can bring criminals to justice as well as supporting the victims.” Chf Supt Simpson said the police refers potential victims to a Vulnerable Young Persons Action Group which involves a number of agencies including children's services and social care.
They added: “The key issue is developing a trust with young people. We must have trusted adults that young people can approach.”
In the Newcastle case, older men preyed on immature teenagers who were plied with cocaine, cannabis, alcohol or mephedrone, then raped or persuaded into having sexual activity with the lure of the illegal drugs at parties.
Northumbria Police launched a major investigation after receiving information from social workers and initially spoke to 108 potential victims.

The economic survey report says that families where a son is born are more likely to stop having children than families where a girl is born.
NEW DELHI – The desire of Indian parents for sons has created an estimated 21 million “unwanted” girls because couples keep having children until they produce a boy, the government said Monday.
Indian parents have historically wanted sons, who are seen as breadwinners and family heirs. Girls are often viewed as a financial burden in a country where the tradition of giving a marriage dowry persists.
Even though sex selection is against the law, illegal gender-based abortions have been blamed for a sex ratio of 940 females for every 1,000 males in the last census.
But many couples continued having children until they produced their desired number of sons, the government said in its annual economic survey report.
“Families where a son is born are more likely to stop having children than families where a girl is born. This is suggestive of parents employing ‘stopping rules' — having children till a son is born and stopping thereafter,” it said.
Couples, particularly women, in India face immense pressure to produce male children and many rural families do not send girls to school, marrying them off young.
But the report said India's preference for sons appeared “inoculated to development”, with even wealthier families not immune.
Illegal sex selection and gender-based abortions remain rampant across social and economic groups in the country, according to several studies.
A 2011 study in the British medical journal The Lancet found that up to 12 million girls had been aborted in the last three decades in India.

It wasn't necessarily a recipe for artistic longevity.
An anonymous painter 2,500 years ago adorned thousands of black ceramic vases with their reddish-orange portraits of armed warriors, lusty satyrs and Greek gods.
Used for everything from wine to olive oil, it's nothing short of miraculous that dozens of these supremely perishable vases somehow survived the millennia, either whole or in large enough fragments for conservationists to reassemble.
Over 50 of these ancient, handsome vessels — created at the dawn of Western art — are on view through Oct. 1 in “The Berlin Painter and Their World” at the Toledo Museum of Art.
“There were a couple vessels found virtually intact,” said museum director Brian Kennedy of the works on display, “but nearly everything has been restored, often from hundreds of pieces.”
On some vases, you can see places where fragments were joined to other fragments. But in many cases, the layperson will be largely stumped.
“I think that's the hidden and most remarkable reality of the show,” Kennedy added. “This is a piece of conservation reconstruction of the highest order.”
The Berlin Painter takes their name from a vase in a Berlin museum, considered one of the artist's very best, which became the standard for identifying their trademark style in other vessels scattered across the ancient world.
The painter may be anonymous, but they lived through a remarkably tumultuous period. They would have witnessed the birth of Athenian democracy, the sack of the city by the Persians, and its ultimate triumph over the invaders.
If the conservation involved in recreating these vessels is impressive, so too is their sheer beauty.
“The Berlin Painter's style is distinguished by a suave elegance and a palpable tension between shape and decoration.” wrote J. Michael Padgett, curator of ancient art at the Princeton University Art Museum, which organized the show.
“His figures, and the ornament accompanying them, are executed with taut, dexterous precision,” Padgett added, “whether on water jars (hydriai), large wine bowls (kraters), or smaller shapes such as jugs (oinochoai) and oil bottles (lekythoi).”
(Want to identify the Berlin Painter's work from that of all the other artists churning out similar vases in the same period? Look for the two delicate lines they used to define ankles.)
While prized, these pots and vases were also everyday working utensils marketed across the city-state's trade routes. Works attributed to the Berlin Painter turned up as far afield as Sicily.
While most of these vases have been pieced back together, the show also has several large fragments on display, like the “Fragment of a Red-figure Volute-Krater with the Return of Hephaistos,” dated to about 490-480 B.C.
(Hephaistos was the Greek god of fire and metallurgy.)
Alas, for residents in other parts of the country, “The Berlin Painter” will close after its Toledo run.
“Because of the value of these objects,” Kennedy said, “and because they're so important to their institutions, they could only be exhibited at two venues,” Princeton and Toledo.
Works on loan came from some of the world's most-prestigious museums, including the British Museum, the Vatican Museums, the Harvard Art Museums, the Musée du Louvre and the Staatliche Museen zu Berlin.
“These are the foundation objects of Western civilization,” Kennedy added. “If there was to be a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to gather these things together, the museums agreed that this should be the occasion.”

JOHANNESBURG, Feb 2 (Reuters) - South Africa's government has approved an application by state power utility Eskom to buy more renewable power from independent producers (IPP), the public enterprises ministry said on Friday.
The deal ends years of investor uncertainty for projects awaiting financial closure and delaying an estimated 58 billion rand ($4.8 billion) of new investment into the economy.
“I have requested Eskom to work expediently to implement the decision and avoid further delays,” Minister Lynne Brown said in a statement.
In May, South Africa's energy regulator agreed to investigate Eskom's refusal to sign power purchase agreements with independent power producers, the South African Wind Energy Association (SAWEA) said.
At the time SAWEA said Eskom's unwillingness to finalise agreements had delayed 2,942 megawatts in new solar and wind projects.
“We are committed to reducing our carbon footprint,” Brown said on Friday.
Eskom generates most of the electricity in Africa's most advanced economy using coal-fired power stations and is the continent's biggest emitter of harmful greenhouse gases.
Whether we like it or not, summer is coming to an end, which means parents are hitting the stores to do their back-to-school shopping.
“Throughout the summer, we see a constant flow of parents,” Jennifer Whyley, the general manager of the Blairmore Staples in Saskatoon, said.
“Definitely in the last week or so we've seen it ramp up, we're really starting to see it pick up for back-to-school.”
READ MORE: Parents spend more on back-to-school than holiday shopping: survey
But a new poll shows that Canadian parents are planning to spend more to meet their child's school supplies list.
“It is outpacing inflation,” Caval Olson-Lepage, a financial planner with TCU Wealth Management Financial, said.
“Part of it would be stores are raising their prices a little bit, it might be a bit more expensive to produce the supplies.”
While the poll from Ebates suggests the average amount Canadians will spend is $183, some parents are expecting to spend upwards of $300.
Dads are likely to spend an average of $190, which is more than moms at $178.
Despite the numbers, experts say there are ways to fulfill the school supplies requirements.
“You get your back to school list, and it's very detailed,” Olson-Lepage said.
“You need to buy Elmer's glue, you need to buy this type of pencils, you need to buy this type of scissors. But in the actuality do you really need to buy those?”
“No, you can buy the no name equivalent which is usually at a much reduced cost.”
WATCH BELOW: Save money on your back-to-school shopping
Olson-Lepage is also recommending parents take a look in the storage closet before heading to the store.
“Check your school supplies from last year,” they said. “I don't know if anyone else is like my kid, but they came home with a full pencil case, so to me that means I don't need to buy pencils again this year for him.”
According to the poll, school supplies remain the most popular items sought by parents, followed by clothing and shoes.
But bigger-ticket items are making their way into the budget.
“What we're really seeing this year is starting to trend toward technology,” Whyley said.
“We're seeing a lot more Chromebooks and laptops going into the classrooms.”
Sixty-seven per cent of parents says they plan to do some of their back to school shopping online, a big jump since 2014.
Other methods to save include searching retailer websites for deals, using coupons or promo codes, and even including your child in the budgeting process.
“Do the research, if you take the time to do the research and you plan, you're going to come out spending less than you originally planned,” Olson-Caval said.
Parents are also recommended to check with their schools to see if they support programs that provide students with school supplies for a flat fee, saving parents time and money.
Canadian Eugenie Bouchard beat American wildcard Allie Kiick 6-2, 6-2 to be among a parade of former top 20 players to win their first-round qualifying matches at the Miami Open on Monday.
Bouchard, a former Wimbledon finalist who has fallen outside the top 100 in the world rankings since reaching a career-high fifth in 2014, fired seven aces as they dispatched Kiick.
The 24-year-old Canadian, who last month won a slip-and-fall lawsuit against the U.S. Tennis Association over an incident at the 2015 U.S. Open that left them with a concussion, was playing their first match since a first-round loss at Indian Wells two weeks ago.
Yanina Wickmayer, who climbed to a career-high 12th in the rankings shortly after reaching the Miami Open quarter-finals in 2010, also advanced but needed nearly 2-1/2 hours to earn a 6-4, 6-7(3), 6-4 win over Australia's Olivia Rogowska.
Andrea Petkovic, a former world number nine, booked their spot in the second round of qualifying when German compatriot Sabine Lisicki retired. Petkovic was leading 4-6, 6-3, 3-1.
Former French Open runner-up Sara Errani, who was ranked fifth in the world in 2013, fell at the first hurdle after being beaten 6-4, 5-7, 7-6(2) by Czech Tereza Martincova.
Ontario Provincial Police are investigating after a fatal accident on Hwy. 401 early Monday morning, just hours before the launch of an OPP truck blitz. Catherine McDonald reports.
Daria Gavrilova overcame their own nerves to get a first round win over Kristina Mladenovic in Cincinnati.
Daria Gavrilova fought off nerves and some serious serving problems to beat French world No.13 Kristina Mladenovic in the first round of the Western and Southern Open.
Gavrilova won a rollercoaster ride of a match 6-0 7-6 (8-6) to claim a big scalp and book a second round showdown with Italian qualifier Camila Giorgi.
Gavrilova acknowledged they were lucky to get through the tough first round clash.
"I knew that Kiki didn't play their best game (in the first set), or probably throughout the whole match, but neither did I," Gavrilova said.
"We have pretty similar game styles, both like to be aggressive with the forehand and pretty creative. It's always tough to play someone similar to you, and we're pretty good friends off the court too.
"First rounds are always tough. So I'm just happy for the W."
The Australian world No.26 breezed through the first set in 24 minutes smacking several forehand winners against a misfiring Mladenovic and looked in complete control.
Helping them were the errors streaming from Mladenovic's forehand wing, but then in the second set the match changed.
Gavrilova started going for more and made errors of their own, while Mladenovic was making them shots.
Still Gavrilova broke Mladenovic at 4-4, but their serve, so often a problem let them down as they proceeded to serve many of their 11 double faults late on.
Serving for the match at 5-4 the 23-year-old Australian opened with two double faults and gave the break back.
When Mladenovic took a 6-5 lead they were full of confidence.
Gavrilova though took the match to a tiebreak and hung tough. And when a Mladenovic forehand sailed long Gavrilova advanced.
Giorgi had a much easier day, beating Czech player Katerina Siniakova 6-2 6-2.
They are joined in the second round by 14th-seeded Czech Petra Kvitova, who advanced with a 1-6 7-6 (7-2) 6-3 win over Anett Kontaveit.
Unseeded trio Kiki Bertens of the Netherlands, Lesia Tsurenko of Ukraine and Beatriz Haddad Maia of Brazil also advanced to the second round.
America's Cup - New York Yacht Club makes a smart early move
Quantum Racing - 2016 Egnos 52 Super Series Cascais Cup Nico Martinez/ Martinez Studio Quantum Racing - 2016 Egnos 52 Super Series Cascais Cup Nico Martinez/ Martinez Studio
by Richard Gladwell, Sail-World.com NZ today at 10:32 amComing just seven days after the Protocol joint announcement, most would have expected the club with the longest involvement in the America's Cup to have at least waited until the concept drawing of the AC75 was published, at the end of November, before confirming their intentions.Or more usually to keep their powder dry until entries opened on January 1, 2018.The New York Yacht Club will be represented by two groups working under the aegis of the Bella Mente Quantum Racing Association (BMQRA), led by two yachtsmen and business people John J. “Hap” Fauth of Naples, Florida, and Doug DeVos of Grand Rapids, Michigan.DeVos is president of Amway and the son of Rich DeVos who headed up the New York Yacht Club Challenge at the 1987 America's Cup in Fremantle. Doug DeVos is best known for their exploits on the MedCup (TP52) and its successor the Super 52 Series. The DeVos owned Quantum Racing won the series trophy in 2008, 2011, 2013, 2014 and 2016.Interestingly in their brief foray into the TP52/MedCup, Emirates Team New Zealand won the series in 2009 and 2010, while the America's Cup was being litigated in the New York Supreme Court.Fauth is a three-time world champion in the Maxi72 Class helming three yachts in the owner-driver class all named Belle Mente.
CEO and skipper of the new team will be Terry Hutchinson, tactician for Team New Zealand in the 2007 America's Cup in Valencia which they lost 5-2 to Alinghi.
The basics of the AC75 class for the 36th America's Cup were leaked by the Italians and then confirmed by the New Zealanders as a high-performance monohull.
Now just a week old, the new Protocol has survived with very minimal criticism. The purring has been deafening.
That's a complete contrast to the controversy and torrent of 16 amendments made in the first week of its predecessor, governing the 35th America's Cup, launched in June 2014 after a nine-month gestation period.
The key provision in the new Protocol for New York Yacht Club and others interested in a fast start is that while the use of surrogate boats longer than 12 metres is prohibited, class boats such as the TP52 (and presumably its clone the Super Series 52) are specifically excluded from the definition of Surrogates. In other words, an America's Cup team can train and race the 52ft class boat almost without restriction.
That's and an about-face from the Protocol for the previous America's Cup which decreed 'any entity that has been selected to represent any yacht club in AC35 shall not compete in any regatta not forming part of any [America's Cup] Event without the prior written approval of the Commercial Commissioner.'
Simply put that meant for an America's Cup entry to race as a team outside the America's Cup Regatta or America's Cup World Series, permission was required. While a few individual team members raced in the occasional non-AC event, none of the Cup teams sailed their first line crew in other events.
A maybe paranoid Team New Zealand is believed to have questioned as to whether that restriction applied to competing in RNZYS club racing.
Under the new Protocol, teams are essentially allowed complete freedom as to events in which they race, except for an America's Cup ambush regatta. It works both ways - other events gain prestige and attention with America's Cup teams competing, and it is good exposure for the Cup from a non-America's Cup event.
New York YC/Bella Mente Quantum Racing Association can certainly race under their own name and with their first-line America's Cup crew.
BMQRA are expected to continue racing as Quantum Racing in the Super52 Series. It may well be that they can also race in the Maxi72 Class, which was not specifically named but which is also subject to a class rule like the Super52.
A quick scan of the crew rosters for both Quantum Racing and Bella Mente show they are packed with Italians, Kiwis and a couple of other breeds, as well as several top sailors who are also US nationals.
If the two programs are to be used for America's Cup crew development some changes will have to be rung.
Attracting and developing sailing talent will be one of the biggest issues facing the teams who don't have the benefit of links with successful national Olympic programs or other feeder programs that are producing international world championship winners on an ongoing basis.
The USA hasn't had a top performing Olympic program for some years.
Others have the Olympic sailors but don't have the interfaces to their America's Cup programs - if indeed they have one.
The exception is New Zealand which won in Bermuda with a crew which had five Olympic medalists in the nine-strong named Cup race squad. The same group had only one America's Cup between them and in that respect were the lightest crew to ever win the trophy.
A much tighter Nationality rule in the new Protocol requires all sailing crew either be bona fide nationals of the country of their club or satisfy the residence tests contained in the Protocol.
By racing in the Super52's (and maybe Maxi 72) Bella Mente Quantum Racing will be able to bring on and trial promising US crew, and develop them on the race circuits to bring them up to the America's Cup standard.
And the sooner they get this process started the better. With three US teams tipped to enter the 36th America's Cup being first to announce and moving smartly after that move makes a lot of sense.
For New York Yacht Club and BMQRA, there was no point concealing their hand until January 2018. They are better to get their intentions out there and start attracting and signing the pick of available US America's Cup team talent.
The two other teams who have indicated to Team New Zealand that they will be entering, Land Rover BAR (GBR) and Groupama Team France (FRA) don't have the same issues.
The Brits can draw from a very successful series of Olympic campaigns going back to 2000, plus their academy and Red Bull Youth America's Cup programs established during the last Cup cycle.
France too also has a strong Olympic and offshore racing base that it can use as talent suppliers.
One of Team New Zealand's winning strategies of the last America's Cup was being able to turn adversity into a strength by taking a novel approach and making the best use of assets they did have.
It will be interesting to see if New York Yacht Club's America's Cup team does the same.
With the club's less than flattering record in the America's Cup post-1980, a new approach is required. Maybe Thursday's announcement is a vital first step down that path.

Across Canada, there have been 1,982 assisted deaths since it became legal
In the first half of this year alone there were 312 medically assisted deaths in B.C., according to Health Canada.
Since medically assisted dying became legal in June of last year, there have been 500 assisted deaths in the province. In the previous six months, there were 188 assisted deaths.
A Health Canada interim report released Friday stated the overall numbers nationally are consistent with international experience.
Across Canada, there have been 1,982 assisted deaths since June 2016, counting for about 0.7 per cent of all deaths nationally.

READ MORE: Panel finds documentation issues plague assisted dying in B.C
In B.C., cancer was the most frequent underlying medical condition in assisted deaths, cited in 64 per cent of cases, followed by neuro-degenerative conditions and circulatory or respiratory conditions.
Although the average patient was aged 73 at death, B.C. had some of the youngest patients compared to other provinces, with 24 residents under 55 at the time of death.
Moving forward, provincial laws dealing with assisted death have been clarified or expanded and other changes are likely.
“It is expected that how services are organized, delivered and monitored will continue to evolve as data becomes more available and jurisdictions are able to evaluate existing policies and service delivery models,” the report said.

MARGAO: Margao being the commercial center has several public toilets constructed by various government agencies and are maintained by Sulabh Sauchalaya International, however the condition of some of the toilets are in a pathetic condition and are poorly maintained.
Though in some toilets there are facilities available, several people including tourists, vendors and traders are seen answering natures call outside the facility. It is pertinent to note that people are least bothered about the public movement around the market area and relieve themselves in open spaces making the place dirty and stinking.
According to sources earlier the use of urinals was free. However, it is now observed that recently Sulabh Sauchalaya has started charging for the use of the toilets. The charge levied is not only unjustified, but also an inconvenience to public due to non availability of change/coins at all times.
The common grievance of the general public is when the government collects revenue by way of Swatch Bharat cess, the levy of charges for use of urinals is unjustified.
Meanwhile former chairperson of Margao municipal council and shadow council convenor Savio Coutinho said that they have written a letter to Governor Mridula Sinha on the lack of proper toilet facilities in the state.
Coutinho said that Margao has several public toilets constructed by various government agencies and are maintained by the Sulabh Sauchalaya International, but for various reasons these toilets lie in a pitiable state.
They pointed out that a few months back, the SCM led a protest in front of a public toilet. SCM planted a coconut sapling in front of the toilet and put a challenge to the authorities by stating whether they wish to see the coconut sapling bearing fruit first, or whether the toilet will get repaired.
Coutinho strongly felt that when the government spends crores of rupees on advertisements on Swatch Bharat Abhiyan and appealing to the public to use public latrines, the government should also work out modalities with the Sulabh authorities to consider free use of urinals.
As per inquires made it is learnt that on an average a minimum number of 400 people use a single sulabh toilet facility in Margao every day. Therefore, by collecting Rs 2 per person it clearly indicates that a sort of business is conducted by levying charges for use of urinals.
As such, the huge expenditure on advertisements through high profile movie stars shall be meaningless in the absence of proper facilities, they said. Coutinho sort Governor Mridula Sinha's help to work out modalities to provide free use of urinals not only in Margao but the entire state of Goa.
Josh Norman avoided a major injury, but the Washington Redskins cornerback will still be out about a month.
NFL Network Insider Ian Rapoport confirmed Friday that Norman is out four weeks with a rib fracture and small puncture in their lung, per sources informed of the situation. Norman confirmed the recovery timeline via Twitter:
The Pro Bowl corner suffered the injury just before halftime of Monday night's loss to the Kansas City Chiefs.
The Redskins are on a bye this week, meaning the four-week absence should place Norman's return around Week 9 versus the Seattle Seahawks.
Responsible for some of my happiest moments as a fan. You will be missed.
I was one of their roughest critics the last few years, but they are a giant for life. Thank you!
great story, great guy, before injuries cut them down a great, great receiver.
Great Giant, kept at it despite being un-drafted and overcoming early injuries as well as later ones. Wish you could have tasted another Superbowl opportunity.
but they still gave us plenty of special moments. Thanks for some great memories.
You will be forever part of Giants' lore
plays in Giants history,
etched their name in Giants stone in 2011. Easy guy to root for. Crazy how in 2011 them and Nicks were so dominant and neither are on the team anymore.
local undrafted kid makes team and becomes a star and a champion. The injuries sucked, but thanks for the memories.
by injuries. That 2011 trio was something else, and Cruz was absolutely lethal in open space down that stretch run. Thank you Vic, you will be missed.
that all 3 stud WR's of our 2011 team had their careers cut short. I remember when we debated at length on this board over which of them we would be able to keep, still can't believe all of them are done in the league due to injuries, absolutely unreal. Cruz will always be remembered, I remember them being real good to the fans at training camp.
CRUUUUUUUZ!
Tremendous production for a few years, a bushel of highlight reel plays, playoff heroics, a Super Bowl ring, and capped off by a very admirable comeback from a brutal injury. One of the best Giants of this era…you will be missed Victor
how they saved the season with that catch/run against the Jets…..we had turned our season around with a big win in Dallas, and threw it away the following week with a clunker against Washington…. The next week against the Jets, we were lifeless, until the catch….will never forget that play….. Apparently, from what the Giants saw from them this season, means, they are all done…….
by a WR in modern history, moreso due to how they burst upon the scene. Simply put: the Giants do not win the SB without him. Injuries have just killed the Giants at that position. I'm glad Victor got a decent payday before they left.
The 99-yarder, the TD against Dallas in Week 17, their dominant performance against SF in the championship game, and then catching a TD in the Super Bowl. As magical a season as one could have. On top of that, they were one of the more popular players I recall wearing a Giants uniform. Not sure if their playing days are over, but he'll have no shortage of opportunities in business, media, fashion, etc., going forward. Thanks, Victor!
.
Very easy guy to root for. Cruuuuuuuuuuuz!
an unknown wr from a small school who racked up crap loads of receptions in college would end up CARRYING this wr unit for a few years. Victor, you earned your money, we love you, rock forever on baby!
Victor! Best wishes, and thanks for all your great work for the Giants. CRUUUUUUUUUUUUZ!
when they broke out that one preseason and suddenly became a ‘somebody' !
You have been a terrific inspiration for so many young players. We wish you and your family the best
Being a local guy and the salsa dance captivated everyone. Being at the 2011 Jets game was one of the coolest moments as a Giants fan as well as the SF NFC Championship game. Guy had the heart of a champion and always left it all on the field. Shame what injuries did to their career, but they made some nice coin and has a very good post-career life ahead of him. Much respect and wish them the best of luck going forward.
Thank you Victor.
to rip the Redskins hearts out in 2012?
You are and always will be a great Giant!!!
…as best as your interests don't conflict with ours… Great Giant with many incredible moments to look back on in that iconic blue jersey. Culminating in a Superbowl Championship.
Thanks Victor. Thanks Mario. Thanks Hakeem.
In Giants History, Victor will be known as one of the best stories of a home town UDFA help make their team a champion.
They had beaten the Giants 6 (?) times in a row so, going into the Linc, it was hard to be optimistic. Then Cruz breaks their first of many long YAC TDs and we're all “oh shit pre-season Jets was not a fluke…this guy is a player.” Beautiful and it only got better.
I'm no dancer, but I'll be sure to have some chips and salsa tonight in your honor.
play against the Jets given the situation and circumstance might be the best offensive scoring play in NY Giants history in terms of sheer ability.
I know it was time but It's sad to see them go..
was the day Victor Cruz broke out …

The Bachelor isn't known for being particularly woke. It's not the most feminist thing in the world to have dozens of women compete for a man's heart (and vice versa) on live TV. As such, there are a number of details about the Bachelor franchise that seem particularly dated. With that in mind, there are a few ways the Bachelor franchise could do better — and the changes wouldn't actually be that hard to implement.
Of course, loving shows like The Bachelor doesn't make anyone a bad feminist. But even fans of the show would probably admit its romantic structure and search of fairytale-inspired endings doesn't always end well for the contestants. There are some Bachelor Nation couples who are still together, but they're not the majority — the show's setup just doesn't seem to lend itself to lifelong relationships.
Overall, it probably wouldn't hurt if The Bachelor was even a little more inclusive. It's kind of ridiculous that there's so little body diversity, as well as ethnic diversity, on the show, considering it's been on for 22 seasons (not to mention countless spinoffs). It's never too late to change, though — just look at how thrilled fans were when Rachel Lindsay was cast as the first black Bachelorette. If the Bachelor franchise decided to become more progressive overall, it's safe to say plenty of people would be thrilled.
1 Bachelors Don't Need To Ask Contestants' Fathers For Permission To Propose ABC/Paul Hebert When contestants land hometown dates on The Bachelor, fans can expect that the leading man will most likely ask their dad for their hand in marriage. (Unsurprisingly, some fathers express hesitance over the question, given the fact that other dads are being asked the same thing.) In many cases, the fathers diplomatically tell the Bachelors that they stand behind whatever their daughters decide. They recognize that their daughters can make their own decisions — so why can't The Bachelor recognize that, too? Hometown dates wouldn't be any less exciting without the often customary question. And without it, the Bachelors might have more opportunities to have meaningful conversations with the finalists' families.
2 Women Should Propose To Men On 'The Bachelorette' ABC/Paul Hebert On The Bachelorette, the woman is in charge, choosing which contestants are sent home each week. The person they end up with at the end of the show is whoever they pick — so why the heck does the guy still have to get down on one knee? It would make way more sense if the Bachelorettes proposed to the winners themselves, the same way men propose on The Bachelor.
3 Appearance Should Be Less Of A Priority ABC/Paul Hebert Yes, it's TV and it's dating — appearance is going to be a factor. Still, The Bachelor's excessive emphasis on looks is both cost-prohibitive for contestants and an unnecessary part of the show itself. A recent E! News report revealed that women spend four times as much money to compete on the show as men do to compete on The Bachelorette. That's just absurd. Would rise ceremonies really be any less intriguing to watch if the women were dressed in cocktail dresses, rather than evening gowns? It can be cost-prohibitive for contestants to feel like they have to buy entire new wardrobes just to compete. And aside from the cost of clothing, The Bachelor could also do away with the shots of women doing their makeup before a date or a rose ceremony. Did fan ever see Arie, say, powdering their nose?
4 The Franchise Could Be More Body Positive ABC/Craig Sjodin It's no secret that a vast majority of the women and men who compete on The Bachelor and The Bachelorette have a specific body type. While there's nothing wrong with being on the slimmer side, it can be disappointing to see only women and men with a certain body shape get out of the limo in each Bachelor season premiere. In an Entertainment Tonight interview earlier this year, a member of The Bachelor's production team suggested part of the problem may be that the show's leads have an idea in mind about who they want to be with — and frankly, that argument shouldn't hold up. "A lot of it does revolve around whom the lead is and who the lead wants to date," Robert Mills, Senior Vice President of Alternative Series, Specials and Late-Night Programming at ABC, told ET. "What you don't want to do is say, 'We're going to put on somebody who's more curvy,' and then they're gone the first night... It's hard, but we're all for as much diversity as possible." Mills' argument seems like a bit of a cop-out, though. It's not giving the Bachelors or Bachelorettes much credit to assume they'd automatically send a plus-size woman or man home immediately, based on nothing but body type. There are plenty of confident, body-positive people out there, and there are surely plenty who would love to appear on The Bachelor.
5 Get Rid Of Any Dates That Are Considered Demeaning ABC/Paul Hebert Plenty of people had justifiable concerns about The Bachelor's wrestling date last season. Bibiana had to endure having their name made fun of, and many of the contestants were visibly uncomfortable during the experience, which didn't sit well with fans.
Cosby's lawyers devoted the last two days of their case to travel records they say prove they could not have been at their suburban Philadelphia home in January 2004. They argue that any encounter there with Constand would have happened earlier, outside the statute of limitations.

Police have closed off a Scunthorpe road to deal with an incident tonight (Monday, August 14).
Humberside Police said the incident is in the Salisbury Close/West Common Lane area of the town.
A statement said: "To ensure the safety of everyone in the area we have put a road closure in place.
"We advise people to avoid the area where possible."
Reports on social media suggest a man is on a roof.
It follows two men who have been arrested in connection with wanted Scunthorpe man Kyle Ferguson.
Sgt James Main confirmed on social media that two men in their 20s have been arrested on suspicion of assisting an offender in relation to Ferguson today (Monday, August 14).
 They are wanted for possession of an offensive weapon, affray, assault and causing a public nuisance by taking to rooftops.
Earlier today, Humberside Police warned those involved in protecting a wanted Scunthorpe man that they could face arrest for obstruction, assisting and offender or other offences.
Eileen Ruan stood bundled up behind a grill, cooking up Spanish omelettes.
Ruan and their group of 25 friends from Pasadena and neighboring cities arrived at noon on Sunday to stake out a spot, working in shifts to ensure they got a great view of the parade.
Each year they come prepared with lots of food and hot drinks, sharing with passers-by when they mistake the group for a coffee stand.
"Waiting for the parade, that's the fun part. It's when everyone gets together," said Phyllis Wang, one of Ruan's friends.
Wang, who in previous years sent pictures of the parade to friends in Northern China, said they were excited some of those friends were visiting this year and will be joining the group later to see it in person.
"When I send photos to my friends in China they say, 'Oh my God, the sky is so blue,'" Wang said. "This year they get to see it for themselves."

A Bristol man has been arrested after a ‘sting operation' by a group of vigilantes.
Officers took a 35-year-old man into custody after they were arrested at their home in Hartcliffe on suspicion of grooming offences.
It comes after a group of vigilantes approached the man's house to confront him, filming the entire incident on Facebook Live.
The group can be seen arguing with the man's relative at their home before they are arrested.
The video, which is nearly 40 minutes long, has been shared thousands of times and already has hundreds of comments. We cannot show it for legal reasons.
Avon and Somerset police confirmed on Monday, December 11, that they had arrested a man from south Bristol.
A spokesperson for the force said: “A 35-year-old man was arrested in Hartcliffe at approximately 3.30pm yesterday (Sunday, December 10) on suspicion of grooming offences.

Paris Saint-Germain star Dani Alves has admitted they would rejoin Barcelona tomorrow if they called him.
The Brazil star left in acrimonious fashion in 2016 after an eight-year stay on a free transfer to Juventus.
After 391 appearances, six La Liga titles and three Champions Leagues, Alves remains bitter at not receiving the respect they feel they deserved for their hand in creating history at the club - but would still consider a stunning return to the Nou Camp.
"Barcelona is my home," Alves told Globo TV. "It's impossible to say that I wouldn't return. I would come back tomorrow if Barcelona were to call me.
"If I were to say that I didn't leave there feeling hurt then I'd be lying. I left hurt because I think I fought hard to create a great history at Barcelona.

"I left with 23 titles in eight years. I finished up giving them more great results and then they ended it without respecting my story.
"They wanted me to have a farewell and I told them no, because I consider that place my eternal home and when a place is considered your home you don't have to say goodbye. What's the point in a farewell if you're going to come back?"
Alves still has another year on their PSG deal, but that did not prevent them from leaving the Bianconeri last summer when they insisted on their desire to leave, meaning a third successive summer move could be on the cards.
NAWABSHAH, Jul 04 (APP):Hundreds of women came out to protest against hours long load shedding of gas in nearby areas of Daulatpur town and occupied the camp set up to welcome rally of Bilawal Bhutto Zardari.
Protesting women were chanting slogans “Bilawal first give gas then take vote”. Later these women and children came on National highway.
Talking to media these women said that long hours load shedding of gas has become a trend since long time and children and male members have to go to school and to their workplaces without breakfast while gas also remains unavailable when they return from schools, shops and offices.
Protesting women said that elected representatives of PPP seems not interested in resolving the issue so they were constrained to stage demonstration in front of rally of PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari.

A strengthening US dollar and rising US bond yields on higher inflation expectations may trigger volatility in EM equities.
Indian equities have bounced back smartly off their lows recently. Indeed, that is true for most markets around the globe. But does danger lurk around the corner? The International Monetary Fund (IMF) certainly seems to think so.
IMF, in its recently published Global Financial Stability Report, says emerging markets (EMs) have benefited immensely from a prolonged period of easy money policies and low interest rates worldwide. However, it also says that financial vulnerabilities that have accumulated during this period of low rates pose a threat to global economy. It points towards the risks of a sudden liquidity squeeze by global central banks which could cost EMs a fortune.
Even in a best-case scenario of a smooth tightening process by the US Federal Reserve in which there is no increase in investor risk aversion, EMs could experience a massive outflow of foreign money, says the Global Financial Stability Report.
Says the report, if “the US Federal Reserve's balance sheet normalization proceeds as announced and the federal funds rate is raised to 3.6% by early 2020….. portfolio flows to EMs are estimated to be reduced by an average of $40 billion a year in 2018-19.”
This number would look uglier if the policy tightening process is accompanied by a rise in risk aversion. In that case, portfolio flows could be reduced by a total of $60 billion a year over the same period, equivalent to one-quarter of annual inflows in 2010–17.
What would cause these scary scenarios? If inflation in the US rises faster than expected, possibly owing to recent fiscal expansion, the Federal Reserve may respond to it by tightening monetary policy more forcefully than currently anticipated.
In such a scenario, financial conditions could tighten sharply, generating adverse spillovers to other advanced and emerging market economies, as well as adversely affecting internationally active banks that rely on dollar funding, the IMF said. Consequently, it recommends that global central banks adopt a gradual pace of tightening, but it also warns investors of a nasty surprise on the inflation front.
Of course, fears of trade wars and rising protectionism do not bode well for the global economy. But even before any impact on trade, it could lead to decline in confidence and a tightening in financial conditions, making it a separate and substantial headwind to growth, said the IMF.
A strengthening US dollar and rising US bond yields on higher inflation expectations may trigger volatility in EM equities.
Although the recent bout of volatility in global equity markets did not lead to any major dislocations, the episode underscores the need for investors and policymakers to remain attuned to the risks associated with rising interest rates after years of low rates and low volatility, the IMF cautioned.
Amazon is still talking to Massachusetts officials as the retail behemoth searches for a place to put down its second headquarters.
Gov. Charlie Baker offered a quick comment on the company's search for "HQ2" during a Wednesday appearance on WGBH's "Boston Public Radio" show.
"They're still engaged in what I would describe as a back and forth with us and others around sort of what you call loose ends," Baker said. "I mean, it's just a ton of detail type stuff."
Baker made the comments as recent reports suggest the Washington, D.C. area is the favorite.
"The evidence is now piling up that Amazon is looking seriously at the nation's capital for its HQ2," Business Insider reported earlier this month. "After all, it may be the only place large enough to capture the company's growing ambitions across multiple sectors with its high-profile colleges, sprawling transportation system, and high concentration of powerful people."
Three of the 20 locations on Amazon's current list of potential sites are in the D.C. area, including Montgomery County and Northern Virginia.
The Boston area is also on the list. Boston Mayor Marty Walsh put together a bid with neighboring Revere. The city of Somerville also made the cut.
Asked about D.C. as a potential favorite, Walsh told MassLive on Tuesday, "I think it's all rumor at this point."
Flight records show which Amazon HQ2 cities Jeff Bezos' jet has visited -- and which it hasn't
Boston was frequently mentioned as a favorite in different publications not too long ago, Walsh added.
"I don't think we fully know," Walsh said. "I think it's still a very fluid situation."
Walsh added, "We have not spoken to Amazon in a while. I'm sure they're trying to figure out the process, I'm sure it's a very complicated process on their part as far as creating such a big entity in another part of the country. So we're kind of seeing what happens."
On "Boston Public Radio," Baker also responded to a question about Apple, the iPhone giant searching for space for another campus.
"They have people here in Massachusetts but they have not, to the best of my knowledge, reached out to us," Baker said. "I don't know if they've reached out to people at the local level or not."

With five colors to choose from, there's a good chance you'll want to show off the back of your G7 as much as possible. To preserve the clean aesthetic of your phone as much as possible while adding a bit of protection, a thin, clear case is the perfect solution. Spigen has been making great cases for a wide range of phones for years, and its Liquid Crystal case for the G7 ThinQ is no exception. It protects the back and sides of the phone from drops or scratches, and features cutouts with plenty of room for the camera, fingerprint sensor, and various ports. Best of all, it's only $12! If the Liquid Crystal case isn't to your liking, though, don't worry — we've already rounded up plenty of other great options. See at Amazon OtterBox Defender Case
If you're more concerned with drop protection than looks, and you don't mind a bit of added thickness (okay, it's more than a bit thicker), the OtterBox Defender might be more up your alley. OtterBox has been one of the biggest names in the case market for years, and for good reason — few other cases offer the same level of shock absorption. The Defender series even includes a built-in screen protector, though bear in mind it's a plastic screen protector that sits above the display rather than adhering to it, which you may or may not appreciate. At $49.95, it's a little pricey though, so if you can go without the screen protector, the thinner Symmetry series might be a better fit. See at OtterBox OtterBox Alpha Glass Screen Protector
While OtterBox's reputation is mostly built around its cases, the company also makes some of the best tempered glass screen protectors money can buy. The Alpha Glass screen protector keeps your G7's display scratch-free, and should absorb the damage from any serious drops. For $39.95, though, the Alpha Glass is pretty expensive compared to other screen protectors. There are plenty of cheaper options that should still protect your screen from most damage. See at OtterBox Anker PowerCore II 10000 Portable Charger
The G7 ThinQ may have a 3500mAh battery, but even that may not be enough for some people. If you find yourself burning through your battery faster than you'd like, a portable battery pack is a great way to stay up and running all day. Anker is always a great option for power-related accessories, and the PowerCore II 10000 is perfect for the G7. While Anker makes bigger battery packs, the PowerCore II 10000 is small enough to fit in any bag or even a pocket, and offers quick top-ups through Anker's PowerIQ 2.0 technology. It's quick to recharge as well; if you have a USB-C cable handy (and if you're using it with the G7, you definitely do), you can top up the PowerCore II 10000 in just four hours. $31.99 for all of that isn't too bad of a deal. See at Amazon Samsung Fast Charge Wireless Charging Convertible Stand
A frustrating number of recent flagship phones have shifted to glass backs, but excluded the convenience of wireless charging that helps justify the more fragile material. Thankfully, the G7 ThinQ isn't one of them, and charges just fine on a wireless charging pad. While there are plenty to choose from, our favorite remains Samsung's Fast Charge Wireless Charging Convertible Stand. While the name is a mouthful, the pad itself it is simple to use. You can lay it flat or prop up the base, then simply place your G7 on the stand to instantly begin charging. Wireless charging still isn't quite as fast as charging through a cable, but Samsung's unit is still quick enough for most purposes, and it places less wear on your phone's USB-C port. Samsung's wireless charger used to cost as much as $90, but these days you can pick it up for just $46. See at Amazon Samsung EVO 128GB MicroSD Card
For most people, the G7's built-in 64GB of onboard storage should be plenty, but if you're the type who likes to fill your phone with media, a microSD card could be useful. LG is one of the few remaining brands to support microSD expansion, after all, so you might as well take advantage of it! MicroSD cards are a dime a dozen these days, but one of the best options for most people is the Samsung EVO. Rated at UHS Class U3, it's one of the fastest cards around, making it perfect if you plan on shooting a lot of 4K video. At $40 for the 128GBGB card, it's reasonably priced as well, but if you need even more storage, SanDisk's 200GB card is a much more affordable option than stepping up to Samsung's 256GB card.

Vintage Newport Beach will be on display Saturday with a tour of historic homes and other sites on Balboa Island.
The third annual home tour, put on by the Balboa Island Museum & Historical Society, highlights five houses, a 1934 wooden yacht, the museum's home at 327 Marine Ave., and the Royal Hen restaurant, formerly Amelia's, at 311 Marine Ave.
One of the homes, at 1810 S. Bay Front, was built in 1947 on the former site of the Balboa Yacht Club clubhouse.
The yacht, Phantom, is fresh off a winning appearance at the annual Newport Beach Wooden Boat Festival, where it snagged the Harbormaster Trophy for best powerboat and the People's Choice Award for cruisers over 40 feet. It will be docked along South Bay Front.
Addresses for the other homes – two on Crystal Avenue, one on North Bay Front and one on Ruby Avenue – will be available for tour attendees on Saturday. The self-guided tours run from 11 a.m. to 4 p.m.
Tickets are $35 for museum members and $40 for nonmembers. Visit balboaislandmuseum.org/ or call (949) 675-3952 for more information.

In 2013, the Vancouver-Point Grey riding was won by NDP candidate David Eby.
Eby won by 1,063 votes; 47.6 per cent to 43.2 per cent, beating Christy Clark in what was Gordon Campbell's old riding. It will likely be close again, but Eby has carved out a good public profile since the election, which should make things a little smoother for him.
In 2009: Then premier Gordon Campbell won this riding over NDP challenger Mel Lehan for the second straight time, defeating them 50 per cent to 40 per cent. Needing a seat in the legislature, Clark replaced them in a 2011 by-election, defeating Eby by just over 500 votes, 49 per cent to 45 per cent.
History & Geography: The Vancouver-Point Grey riding has existed since 1933, but Vancouver-Quilchena was split off from the previously two-member riding in 1991. It now consists of UBC, along with all of Vancouver, north of 16th and west of Arbutus. The liberals tend to dominate in Point Grey and the University Endowment Lands, while the NDP do well in Kitsilano.
Candidates
BC Liberals- James Lombardi: A ‘social entrepreneur', Lombardi has worked for the Free the Children charity and was director of “We Day”. Lombardi has the support of several prominent B.C. Liberal funders, including Lorne Segal and Wendy Lisogar-Cocchia.
NDP-David Eby: First elected in 2013, Eby has enjoyed a high profile as opposition housing critic. Before politics, Eby, a lawyer, was the longtime executive director of the B.C. Civil Liberties Association. Prior to that, they worked for the Pivot Legal Society.
Greens- Amanda Konkin: A producer and actor, they were on the production team of the world's first transgender sitcom “The Switch.”

Donald Trump, left, actor Arianne Zucker, and Billy Bush, then an "Access Hollywood" host, are seen in an image from a 2005 recording.
As Hollywood continues to react to a report detailing decades of sexual harassment allegations against Harvey Weinstein, Washington, D.C., is getting a 12-hour public screening of the president's lecherous “Access Hollywood” video.
The demonstration being held on the National Mall is organized by UltraViolet, a women's advocacy group, to commemorate the almost one-year anniversary of the hot-mic tape's release by the Washington Post.
“The ‘Access Hollywood' video was a disgusting display of Trump's true colors. It was not so-called ‘locker room talk,' it was a man bragging about sexually assaulting women. That man may now sit in the Oval Office, but we will not let them — or anyone else — forget the tape or those comments,” Shaunna Thomas, co-founder of UltraViolet, said in a statement released Thursday.
“Following the release of this footage, numerous women came forward to accuse Trump of sexual assault, and we have only seen this boorish behavior continue since taking office. The Donald Trump on that tape is the same Donald Trump that sits in the Oval Office every day, aggressively pursuing an anti-woman agenda, including the active dismantling of legal protections for survivors of sexual assault. That is why we are showing the video on loop in D.C., and that is why it is all the more important that we stand up and ‘grab back,' ” Thomas concluded.
UltraViolet's protest Friday took place at the same time as the Trump administration's rollback of Obama-era legislation that forced employers to provide women with contraceptives at no cost as part of their health plans.
In addition to the “Access Hollywood” perpetual screening from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. Eastern time, UltraViolet also held a “Rally to Grab Back” at noon in D.C.'s Lafayette Square. The group was joined by Planned Parenthood, Working Families and NARAL to continue to lobby for women's rights.
It's been a surreal few days for Jason Maslakow, but the Toronto Maple Leafs superfan now known as Dart Guy said it's a a dream come true.
On Saturday, as the Leafs evened up the Eastern Conference Quarter-Finals against Washington in Game 2, Maslakow inadvertently clinched a little glory themselves from the stands.
A camera panned their way during the double-overtime nail-biter, and a meme was born.
The image has spawned scores of parodies and gained the attention of the team and the NHL. Leaf fans on social media have changed their profile photos in a show of solidarity.
“I could have never fathomed something like this would have happened,” Maslakow said on the Kelly Cutrara Show on Monday.

Though it was their painted face and blue beard — and that dangling unlit cigarette — which were on display in the now-viral image, their get-up didn't stop there. They had also shaved “Go Leafs go” and the Stanley Cup into their head.
“I've never really done it at a regular season game, but going to Washington there for Game 2, I was not going to miss the opportunity to troll the Washington fans a little bit with my get-up,” they said.
Maslakow, who drove to the game from Waterloo, Ont., with a few friends, explained they had no idea they had been caught on camera until a reporter from The Washington Post approached them for an interview.
A huge thank you to @MapleLeafs for the tickets to the game tomorrow!!! See you there and GO LEAFS GO! #Dartguy — The Maz (@LeafsMaz20) April 16, 2017
Thanks to the Leafs, Maslakow said he'll be at the Air Canada Centre on Monday night for Game 3. And for Game 4, he'll be a guest of radio host John Derringer of Q107, a sister station to AM640.
And yes, they explained while pulled over on the side of the highway on the way to Toronto on Monday afternoon — he'll be dressed up.
“I'm actually already done up,” they said. “I'm driving down the 401 and people are giving me some weird looks.”

The question on everyone's lips seems to be around how Kate, the Duchess of Cambridge, could look so fabulous after giving birth to their baby son.
They and Prince William introduced their newborn Prince to the world on the steps of St Mary's Hospital yesterday, and Kate looked glowing as they smiled with their hair and make-up perfectly put together.
The Loose Women panelists, today being Andrea McLean, Nadia Sawalha, Janet Street-Porter and Kelly Brook, decided to look back at their own post-baby pictures, reflecting on how different they looked compared to Kate.

Nadia even commented that the "poor woman" more likely wanted to sit at home with a rubber ring and be left well and truly alone, rather than being paraded onto the steps of the Lindo Wing at the hospital.
So as they all showed their photos, the audience cooed and smiled as they watched images of Anne Diamond, Nadia Sawalha, Stacey Solomon and Linda Robson pass by on the big screen.
Throughout the show those without children pressed for information about the phenomenon, including Kelly Brook asking Andrea McLean whether mothers ever have a favourite child.

The Scottish presenter looked coy as they said: "No, you love them all equally and that's the end of that," which sparked laughter from the rest of the panelists.
Nadia also went into some details about what it's like to be the middle child, saying that their elder sister, Dina, was focused upon more by the parents while Julia, their younger sister, was spoiled rotten.

As a result, Nadia loved being in the middle as they were "left to it" by the adults around them
Janet, however, said having a younger sister changed everything for the worse when they realised a "tadpole" would be taking some of their parents' affection.
The panel were discussing the new Prince's place among their siblings, and the joys of growing up with siblings and giving birth to children throughout the show, with guests Nigel Farage and Jason Donovan being interviewed between.
Loose Women airs from 12.30pm weekdays on ITV.

Students at the Montpelier High School in Montpelier, Vt., raise a Black Lives Matter flag on Thursday, Feb. 1, 2018, as part of a series of activities on racism. The student-led move, part of Black History Month, in the Montpelier school that is less than 5 percent black has sparked some backlash, but school officials say they've received overwhelming support from the community. On Thursday, black students took turns raising the flag in a ceremony attended by students, staff and community members. Lisa Rathke AP
ISLAMABAD, Jul 4 (APP):National Institute of Folk and Traditional Heritage (Lok Virsa) on Wednesday organized Muzakra on “The Sufi Route in 21st Century” here at its media center.
Speakers including Dr Tanvir Anjum and Mussarrat Youssuf discussed in the “The Sufi Route in 21st Century”. They said that “We live in an age when science and technology have brought humankind not only great material advances, but also a deep cynicism towards the religious and spiritual aspects of life”.
“On the one hand, the success of the “scientific method” has set limitations on what are considered to be useful and practical fields of study” the speakers added.
They further said that “We are taught to believe that only that which the outer senses can perceive and which the rational mind can analyze, are worthy of being called ‘the truth”.
They said that Sufism is a path of spiritual advancement. “By a process of purification, Sufi practices allow light to enter our hearts and our faculties of perception” they said, adding that this may lead to the development of our innate spiritual and intuitive abilities, in the same way that when you open a window to a dark room light floods in and you can suddenly see more.
The discussion was also followed by Mehfil-E-Samaa. Awais Niazi and party will mesmerize the audience with their renditions of famous Kalaam.
“Muzakra” is a bi-monthly programme in which guest speakers bring their literary, intellectual, cultural and social works before the audience and the audience engages with them to explore, elaborate and also to critique it.

Today, America celebrates its 242nd birthday. From the Statue of Liberty to to the Lincoln Memorial, there are many national monuments and memorials that represent our country's history. However, one memorial that has always stood out from the others is Mount Rushmore. Turns out people take notice when you carve 60-foot heads into the granite face of a batholith. Sculptor Gutzon Borglum said they chose George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Theodore Roosevelt, and Abraham Lincoln because they were parts of the most important events in America's history.
In the nearly 77 years since its completion in October 1941, Mount Rushmore has come to be known for more than a tribute to four US presidents. It's become a figure used to distinguish the true all-time greats in their respective fields. So, who would be on the NFL's Mount Rushmore?
Lucky for you, we polled players and these are the responses we got: The four names that received the most votes were QB Tom Brady, LB Lawrence Taylor, RB Barry Sanders, and CB Deion Sanders -- a group of players who are widely regarded as the G.O.A.T.s of their respective positions.

The Minnesota Lynx are champions again. Minnesota and the Los Angeles Sparks provided a fantastic five-game WNBA Finals for the second year in a row. After taking a breath following another great Game 5, let's look back on the 2017 WNBA season and look ahead to 2018.
There were milestones, business and technology advancements, and the emergence of young stars. Here are five things that stood out this year and how they might impact next season:
1. Broadening the fan base and merchandising: The league reached a deal to live-stream 20 games per season via Twitter in 2017, '18 and '19. The idea came from a conversation WNBA president Lisa Borders had with Seattle Storm guard Jewell Loyd, who suggested using Twitter to show games. Borders followed up on it.
The WNBA averaged 613,000 unique viewers for all the games via Twitter this season, with the three most-viewed games averaging 1.1 million.
The league also struck deals with FanDuel to provide daily WNBA fantasy games, and with EA Sports to have the WNBA as part of the NBA Live 18 video game. The first season of FanDuel topped 2.2 million entries.
All of these things bring the WNBA to an audience beyond the fans the league already had. And they help fans, both old and new, to enjoy following the league in different ways. The WNBA always seeks to move more into the so-called "mainstream" sports conversation, and part of that is people having more of a daily interest in games and in the players.
Attendance trended upward this season, with the league having the highest total (1,574,078) and highest average (7,716) since 2011. This was particularly evident for the league's top two teams: The 2016 champion Sparks had their highest average attendance (11,350) since 2002. The Lynx, who on Wednesday won their fourth title, had their best (10,407) since the franchise's inaugural season of 1999.
It's notable that the Lynx did this while playing their regular-season home games at the Xcel Center in St. Paul (home of the NHL's Wild) because the Timberwolves/Lynx home arena, Target Center, has been under renovation. Playing across the river actually seemed to expand the Lynx's footprint in the Twin Cities.

Now, what about more WNBA gear? Nike's eight-year apparel deal with the NBA/WNBA/NBA G League launches with this NBA season, and it has WNBA fans hopeful for a much bigger selection. They want to buy jackets, hats, shirts, shorts, socks, shoes, baby/children's clothes, pet products, etc., that represent their favorite teams, and want more options in sizes (for women, men, gender nonbinary) and colors. The WNBA fans' plea to Nike? Just make it.
2. Milestones: Longtime friends set two major records. Phoenix Mercury star Diana Taurasi passed Tina Thompson and became the league's all-time leading scorer on June 18. Taurasi now has 7,867 points in their career.
Seattle's Sue Bird eclipsed Ticha Penicheiro on Sept. 1 and became the WNBA's assists leader. Bird now has 2,610 assists. (Both records reflect regular-season totals; Taurasi also has 1,081 career playoff points, while Bird has 203 career assists in the postseason.)
Taurasi, 35, and Bird, who turns 37 this month, have been teammates in college, with USA Basketball and overseas. And they have been faces of their respective franchises since being drafted No. 1 (Bird in 2002, Taurasi in 2004).
Neither plans to retire soon, and that's good news for their teams and the league. There was a void in the Indiana Fever franchise this year after Tamika Catchings' retirement, and obviously that will happen someday in Seattle and Phoenix. But Taurasi and Bird have continued to stay at a high level on the court, as Catchings did, and as long as they want to keep playing, the league will be thrilled to have them.

3. Budding superstars: The Connecticut Sun featured young players who grabbed a lot of attention this year, and second-year center Jonquel Jones was the league's Most Improved Player.
Jones put on a show at the All-Star Game, which included a dunk, and they helped lead the Sun to a fourth-place finish in the WNBA at 21-13. Curt Miller was the league's Coach of the Year. Despite a loss to Phoenix in the single-elimination second-round game, the Sun have a lot to look forward to, including the return of post player Chiney Ogwumike, who missed this season with injury.
The Dallas Wings also got an injection of youthful talent, with first-round draft picks Allisha Gray and Kaela Davis from 2017 national champion South Carolina. Gray was the WNBA Rookie of the Year, and both were on the all-rookie team. In the Wings' second year in Dallas, they made the postseason for the second time in the seven years since the former Shock franchise left Detroit.
Seattle has a youthful dynamic duo in Breanna Stewart and Loyd, and both have continued to grow individually. As a team, the Storm struggled all season with consistency, and coach Jenny Boucek was fired in August. Now longtime coach Dan Hughes has come back from a year of retirement to take over in Seattle. Perhaps they can help the Storm live up to their expectations better in 2018.
4. Preparing for the future: There's been a lot of talk about the 2018 draft because of the college/international talent that should be available -- including Diamond DeShields, who bypassed their final season of eligibility at Tennessee and will play professionally this winter.
Editor's Picks Minneapolis celebrates Lynx title with parade For the fourth time in seven seasons, the Minnesota Lynx and their fans celebrated a WNBA championship with a parade.
Lynx regain title, but entire WNBA is a winner Minnesota dethroned Los Angeles to win its fourth title in seven years. But with a competitive and entertaining WNBA Finals that once again went the distance, it felt as if the entire league won.
Lynx's Whalen right at home with fourth WNBA title One year after a heartbreaking loss to the Sparks at home in Game 5, Lindsay Whalen and the Lynx got one back, led by a gritty point guard who refused to let it happen again -- especially on the same court they starred on in college. 2 Related
The Chicago Sky seem to be well-positioned in regard to upgrading talent. The Sky were essentially forced to trade Sylvia Fowles in 2015 and Elena Delle Donne before this season. Both players wanted to move elsewhere.
Under coach/general manager Amber Stocks, the Sky are trying to solidify a group of players who really want to be in Chicago. In Stocks' first year on the job, they led the Sky to a 12-22 mark, and they weren't eliminated from playoff contention until the final weekend.
They also made a trade in late July that sent Tamera Young and Imani Boyette to the Atlanta Dream in exchange for Jordan Hooper and the Dream's first-round draft pick. That means the Sky will have two lottery picks in 2018: theirs and the Dream's.
The date for the draft lottery is still to be announced, but the odds for No. 1 are: San Antonio Stars (44.2 percent), Sky (combined 28.2 percent), Fever (27.6). As the team with the worst combined record for the last two years (15-53), San Antonio not only gets the best odds but also is guaranteed to not get a pick below third. The Stars selected guard Kelsey Plum No. 1 in the 2017 draft.
The Storm, as mentioned, have filled their head-coaching position. The Dream, who fired coach Michael Cooper after the season, have not. And we'll wait to see if any other franchises make coaching moves before 2018. But considering the caliber of next year's draft, there should be a lot of excitement about who's coming into the league in 2018.
5. The Lynx and Sparks are keeping the bar high: There was no letdown by these two teams this season. Their combined records between 2016 and '17 are 55-13 for the Lynx and 52-16 for the Sparks. Their series in those years, including the playoffs, is tied at 8-8. They truly brought out the best in each other.
Age is an unavoidable topic with the Lynx, whose starters were an average of 32.4 years old at the time of the WNBA Finals. But they won the title nonetheless, their fourth in the last seven years. Next year, the Lynx will host the All-Star Game for the first time, and will do so as defending champions. That's a pretty sweet way to celebrate being back at an upgraded Target Center.
The Lynx and Sparks both have made moves in the past few seasons to improve the cores they have. They're likely to do the same this winter. While both teams expect to be challenged not only by each other but also by the rest of the league, it won't be a big surprise if they manage to make it back to the WNBA Finals again next year, too.
As residential space grows in downtown Montgomery, so does the need for representation. Now a Downtown Montgomery Residential Association is closer to becoming a reality.
David Gulino and their family moved to Dexter Avenue three years ago for one reason.
"We work downtown and we live here so it is just convenient," they said.
Downtown has experienced lots of residential growth over the past several years. Currently there are 755 multi-family and mixed use units in that area. Regina Meadows, Executive Director of Building Our Neighborhoods for Development and Success, says plans for a Downtown Neighborhood Association are underway. Already several meeting have been held.
"Those who currently live there felt the need to connect with others and be a voice what is happening downtown," said Meadows.
Not only is this a way for residents to meet, but also discuss things they'd like to see, from more green space to more parking, and how they can support businesses around them.
"It is so business dense right now. So we want to just making sure the two entities match and accommodate each other well."
Residents like Gulino see this as progress.
"We are diverse. We just have to look at how to move forward," said Gulino.
The next step is to elect officers and be ready to operate within the next month.
The Downtown Neighborhood Association would be set up differently than other DNA's in Montgomery. The hope is to have at least one representative per multi-family dwelling.

Part 86 It was asked, “What is the difference if any, in the meaning of the terms, ‘fornication' and ‘adultery'?” Understanding the terms used in the Bible is paramount to comprehending the message of God, and whether or not an idea applies to a particular person. Current English usage of the word fornication in the dictionary is “illicit sexual intercourse on the part of an unmarried person,” and adultery is “voluntary sexual intercourse by a married man with another than their wife or by a married woman with another than their husband” (Webster's Collegiate Dictionary). Let us consider how the Bible uses the terms and withdraw their meaning from a brief biblical word study.

Five people are riding bicycles cross-country from Oregon to Washington D.C. and they're pedaling along Iowa's western border this weekend — the halfway point in their three-month journey.
Dyar Bentz, the program director for the Light the Trail Ride, says they're raising money and awareness about an important cause.
“It's sort of a half-outreach and half-fundraiser program called the Jordan Elizabeth Harris Foundation,” Bentz says. “This is a group that is dedicated to depression research and suicide prevention.” The organization is based in Fort Worth, Texas. It's named for the late daughter of Tom Harris, who's one of the cyclists on the long trek. Harris says their daughter suffered from depression and took their own life in 2012. They say the ride is all about starting conversations on the topic.
“When people see the sign on the side of our van or our truck, they're always asking how we're doing and why we're doing it and what the background is,” Harris says. “It gives us an opportunity to share our story and generally, we get one back. Somebody in whoever's family that's either struggling with depression or even more unfortunately, somebody that may've lost someone to suicide.”
The nationwide adventure is taking the cyclists along the Lewis and Clark Trail and it's posed a string of physical challenges. Harris says they're doing well and managing to stick to their scheduled goals.
“For a couple of old guys, our frames and bodies are holding up pretty darn good,” they say. “We've experienced all kinds of weather. We've seen heavy winds, rain, snow. It's been an interesting ride to say the least.”
They reached Sioux City on Thursday and plan to be in Missouri Valley by Saturday. The group left Oregon on September 3rd and hopes to arrive in Washington D.C. on Veterans Day, November 11th. So far, they've raised $175,000. Harris hopes to expand the foundation nationwide.
Baby boomers are not content to retire the same way previous generations did. Just as they have since they began entering the world in 1946, they've got demands now — and senior housing and retirement communities are working to keep up.
As of 2016, people aged 65 and older numbered nearly 50 million across the country, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. That's 15 percent of the total population. And the boomer generation, born between about 1946 and 1964, is well into crossing that age 65 thresholds.
“One thing we know about baby boomers is that they redefine everything,” said Nancy Carr, the assistant state director of communications for AARP's Maryland chapter. “And they're redefining aging as well.”
What that means in practice is more options. Boomers have a strong sense of individuality, said Elinor Ginzler, Jewish Council for the Aging senior director and director of the organization's Misler Adult Day Center.
“[There is] as much variety in the housing market [for seniors] as possible to match the variety of people,” Ginzler said. “The healthcare piece won't go away but, in my opinion, it's all the stuff around it — what they call amenities, but I call necessities.”
Ginzler pointed to Leading Age, an association for aging service providers, changing its term from “continuing care retirement communities” to “life plan communities” because “care” and “retirement” aren't concepts that resonate with the boomer generation.
One of the main trends both Ginzler and Carr identified was fitness and wellness. Communities are offering not only high quality fitness facilities and classes, but also related elements like nutrition classes, jogging trails and gardening.
Leisure World, a community of 8,000 people aged 55 and older in Montgomery County, just opened a 5,400-square-foot fitness center nearly twice the size of its previous one with updated equipment, more strength training options and a studio room for barre, dance or yoga classes. So far, the response has been immensely positive, said Maureen Freeman, the director of communications for Leisure World.
“A couple weeks ago when they did the ribbon-cutting at 9 a.m., the place was just packed with people,” they said.
Leisure World will also be rolling out a new internal portal residents can access online anytime. It will allow residents to request services, directories and calendars of events. It's not just an element incoming and current residents want, they said, but one “which I think upcoming generations will be expecting.”
Integrating technology is another place where these communities are upping their game, said Carr, pointing to smart homes and medical apps that track health and medication information.
“While use of technology and smartphones continues to grow among the senior community, for boomers it's not a new thing and they're going to want a place to continue that use,” Ginzler said.
Boomers are also, increasingly, avid foodies, Carr said, wanting to know where their food comes from and wanting more than one dining option. Ginzler added that many of these communities will have both high-end kitchens and chefs.
Mainly, Ginzler said, residents “want to be as enriched as they were in the life they built” outside of those communities. Leisure World, for instance, has more than 80 groups and clubs, including a popular Center for Lifelong Learning, which hosts speakers and classes on a variety of subjects.
At the center of these communities is healthcare, and that will likely remain the case, Carr said. Healthcare providers are trying to anticipate the changing health needs for coming generations.
“People are living longer,” they said, “and there's increasing emphasis on creating dementia-friendly spaces and living situations.”
And boomers don't want to waste those extra years. They're prepared to demand both style and quality of life, Ginzler said. n

This 2002 photo of the Valaika brothers. All four were baseball draft picks. Chris (center) with brothers Matt, left, Nick, center, Patrick, right.
The Santa Clarita Valley should hold a parade for the Valaika brothers. Each went to Hart High and each was chosen in baseball's amateur draft.
Nick Valaika, a shortstop from UCLA and Hart, was taken in the 24th round on Wednesday by the Pittsburgh Pirates.
Brother Patrick is with the Colorado Rockies. Oldest brother Chris played in the major leagues with the Reds and another brother, Matt, was taken in the 20th round by the Reds in 2009.
Every season from 2000 through 2014, except for 2007, there was a Valaika playing for Hart.
Hart Coach Jim Ozella said in 2010, "It's one after another."
What a baseball family.
AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - Daimler's new Mercedes A-Class, unveiled on Friday, includes the German automaker's own machine-learning and voice recognition technology in one of the industry's boldest attempts so far to take on Silicon Valley's finest.
The Mercedes “MBUX” dashboard system to be rolled out across the lineup is about as capable at understanding what you say - and more importantly what you mean - as Amazon's Alexa, Apple's Siri or Alphabet's Google Assistant.
Its debut comes as carmakers are embroiled in a tech arms race, raising questions about the ultimate profitability of new services that often duplicate those available on smartphones. Daimler itself warned on Thursday that 2018 profit growth would be dampened by technology investment.
Carmakers, especially premium manufacturers, are resisting the encroachment of tech giants on several fronts including autonomous driving and connected services - whose commercial potential multiplies with voice recognition and assistance.
“It's fine to have Google or Amazon voice apps sitting alongside the main one, but no car company wants the voice activation that controls the air con to be Alexa,” said Mike Ramsey, a Detroit-based analyst with tech research firm Gartner.
The Daimler system “narrows the gap with tech,” Ramsey said. “If it works as advertised, Mercedes will have set a new standard and given hope to other automakers that they can build a voice interface that actually works like Siri or Google.”
Mercedes is updating its A-Class with a new look and engines, roomier interior and semi-autonomous driving features that can help pilot the car in highway traffic.
But its biggest draw is the MBUX system, presented on two large horizontal touch-screens that dispense entirely with dashboard instruments.
It uses artificial intelligence to make sense of commands and even anticipate them by learning the preferences and habits of up to eight different users. Spoken instructions can command everything from navigation to infotainment.
Other auto brands have taken a more affordable approach, often using “mirroring”, which grants access to smartphone apps via a touch-screen interface. Some also route vocal commands straight to Siri, Alexa or Google.
‘NO CHOICE'
Daimler hopes customers already used to voice assistants won't miss Siri or Alexa when they climb aboard and must remember to preface requests with “hey Mercedes” instead.

The A-Class could be a test of whether carmakers can make bespoke voice assistants a selling point that customers are prepared to pay more for.
Daimler Chief Executive Dieter Zetsche rebuffed that idea.
“We've tested it already,” they told reporters at the Amsterdam launch. “We don't test on our customers.”
Unlike its cloud-based rivals, available only when online, the Mercedes assistant uses embedded software from Nuance Communications, a Massachussets-based voice recognition specialist, to continue functioning when data connections fail.

Mercedes declined to say whether the current A-Class starting price of 24,000 euros ($30,000) would rise with the new model. But its profitability will, Zetsche insisted - citing axles among mechanical components where savings had been found to offset higher tech spending.
Carmakers now have “no choice” but to put their best technology into their smallest cars, Evercore analyst Arndt Ellinghorst said. “Otherwise those cars would be uncompetitive.”
“Everyone's using Waze for navigation on their mobile phones because onboard navigation systems are so outdated,” they said. “These things need to change.”
The technology giants are pushing harder for dashboard space. Apple's CarPlay mirroring service includes Siri and is now available on more than 200 vehicle models, while a three-year effort by Amazon has placed Alexa in Ford and Toyota cars.
Suppliers are also jostling. At the CES tech show in Las Vegas, Panasonic showcased an upgraded infotainment system based on Google software, allowing drivers to use voice commands to pull up directions or access some vehicle controls.
The growing interest among suppliers, and Nuance's embedded software technology, may open the way for other carmakers to follow Daimler's lead, Gartner's Ramsey predicts.
“Really slick integration of voice activation systems is the big tech thing we're going to see in cars over the next couple of years,” they said.

Port Moresby Papua New Guinea will ban Facebook for a month while it identifies fake profiles and considers the website's effect on the country. Communication minister Sam Basil said users posting pornography and false information would be identified. They also suggested the country could set up its own rival social network. Facebook has faced scrutiny following the Cambridge Analytica scandal and has been criticised over the way it has tried to tackle fake news. Although only about 10% of people in Papua New Guinea have internet access, the country is proving proactive in its regulation of online services.

Samsung Electronics urges drastic reform
Calling for a complete reform, Samsung Electronics Vice Chairman Kwon Oh-hyun on Monday urged the South Korean tech giant to move on from the Galaxy Note 7 debacle last year and seek new opportunities for future technologies.
“Taking last year's experience, which cost a lot, as a lesson, we have to achieve a complete reform this year,” they said at meeting to kick off the year at Samsung Digital City in Suwon, Gyeonggi Province.
“We should not compromise with even minor problems in terms of product quality (which is) the basic element of product competitiveness. … Let's restore our pride in product quality by improving the production process and strengthening monitoring.”
Kwon suggested establishing a new corporate culture that is open to creative ideas and flexible to change, stressing the intensifying market for future industries and economic uncertainty.
“(Market) uncertainty is intensifying with stagnant growth in major markets and the rise of protectionism. Rival companies are concentrating on future industries, on artificial intelligence and big data, by making drastic investment,” they said. “By facing the reality strictly, let's overcome the crisis confidently.”
The meeting was held without the attendance of Samsung Electronics Vice Chairman Lee Jae-yong, who joined the board in October
Hyundai chief urges company to overcome uncertainty
Hyundai Motor Group Chairman Chung Mong-koo on Monday urged the company to strive to overcome the uncertain business environment and achieve the group's sales target of 8.25 million cars in the new year.
“Trade protectionism is spreading and competition in the auto industry is intensifying, raising business uncertainty” Chung warned Monday during a New Year's meeting. “We will have agile and flexible responses to changes in the external environment by ensuring internal stability and responsible management.”
The company will overcome the challenging business environment by improving the competitiveness of its products, Chung said. The group will enhance the quality of its luxury sedans and new energy vehicles, and introduce more than 10 new models every year.
The group aims to sell 8.25 million units of Hyundai and Kia cars in the new year by pioneering new markets through its 35 production plants in 10 countries, with more vehicles tailored to local markets. It will also expand its lineup of sport utility vehicles and new energy vehicles, according to the company.
The group on Monday said that Hyundai and Kia sold a combined 7.88 million cars in 2016, falling far short of its goal of 8.13 million.
CJ Group to push for M&As
South Korea's CJ Group vowed to actively pursue new strategic mergers and acquisitions in 2017 to strengthen its core businesses and boost their global competitiveness.
“Despite the continued economic downturn and unstable market conditions, I ask all our employees to make this a historic year in the future growth of the company,” said CJ Group Chairman Sohn Kyoung-shik.
Sohn urged CJ to pursue strategic M&As to expand its main businesses -- food, biotechnology, retail and entertainment -- and to break into new, emerging markets that can drive new growth.
CJ's business units should also strive to become the No. 1 player in their respective fields, as well as adopt a culture of aiming to be the best, Sohn said.
Urging employees to help the group “go beyond the ‘Great CJ' to become the ‘World Best CJ,'” Sohn pledged to take the lead in steering the group toward this direction.
CJ is hoping to build upon its 2016 achievements, including CJ CheilJedang's expansion into the home meal replacement food market and driving up exports.
Last year, CJ Korea Express also began constructing the Konjiam Terminal while CJ E&M LED various TV programs and dramas to success including “Three Meals a Day, “Signal” and “Another Oh Hae Young,” the group said.
LG Group calls for fundamental changes
LG Group Chairman Koo Bon-moo on Monday called for a fundamental change in the company's business portfolio, urging employees to seek new opportunities with creative ideas.
“The past ways of achieving success are meaningless when facing the new management environment ahead of us,” they said.
“We need to bring changes in R&D and the manufacturing (process).”
The nation's fourth-largest conglomerate -- which operates a wide range of businesses including electronics, energy and display panels -- has sought to realign its business portfolio in recent years. Under the new corporate slogan, “Innovation for a Better Life,” LG has been developing ways to take the lead in display panels operated by organic light-emitting diodes, batteries for electric vehicles, energy storage systems, smart building systems and green bio solutions. This year marks the group's 70th anniversary.
To accelerate efforts for change, Koo stressed enhancing efficiency, flexibility and transparency at work, and solidifying customer trust.
“We should not tolerate any mistakes related to customer safety by complying with the principles of (maintaining) product quality and a safe environment,” the chairperson said.
“By enhancing transparency at the management (level), we should meet expectations from investors and the society, and step closer to (people) in need.”
Hanwha to focus on core competency
Hanwha Group Chairman Kim Seung-youn asked each affiliate to focus on developing their core competency to lead future growth.
“The advent of the fourth industrial revolution is a big challenge and opportunity for us,” Kim said Monday. “Based on the long-term trend, such as a decrease in the production population, we should beef up our future competency with new technology, new business and new markets.”
The defense unit should aggressively expand in overseas markets while the chemical section should focus on securing high-value-added technologies beyond the conventional business products, according to Kim. For the financial sector, Kim pointed out the current business model is difficult to grow further amid an aging population and new international accounting standards. They encouraged seeking next-generation growth engines based on digitalization, such as financial technology and big data.
As for the photovoltaic sector, Kim said the company should be equipped with an overwhelming technical advantage to solidify the leading position in the fiercely competitive global market.
Hanjin Group to prioritize safety-security balance
Hanjin Group Chairman Cho Yang-ho called in their New Year‘s address for a balance of safety and service to bring “customer happiness” in 2017.
As for Korean Air, the chairperson said that employees must go beyond a simple understanding of service rules and manuals, and make the rules a part of their daily lives through repeated training. Cho said that precise and strict application of existing rules will allow Korean Air to “prevent problematic situations,” seemingly pointing to recent criticisms about flight attendants' safety training.
On the business front, Cho said the company must prepare for predictable risk factors and increase profitability by optimizing flight routes and equipment.
In particular, Cho urged employees to pay closer attention to the needs of the market in order to choose the best flights for both customers and efficiency. Taking a long-term approach to service, rather than chasing immediate profits, would allow Hanjin Group to earn the trust of customers and to contribute to the Korean economy, they said.
Posco stresses further leap for next 50 years
Posco Chairman Kwon Oh-joon on Monday vowed to bring the company to greater heights over the next 50 years, at a New Year's meeting at the company's headquarters in Pohang, North Gyeongsang Province.
Kwon ordered the company to expand its earning power by upgrading its steelmaking business and continue restructuring its business to maximize work efficiency.
“This year should be the year to secure the top steel earning power in the world and wrap up the scheduled restructuring while establishing a foothold for future growth. Let us complete the goal of ‘Posco the Great' and prepare for the leap into the next 50 years,” Kwon said.
The chairperson also highlighted the necessity of cultivating the drive for future growth by establishing a smart system.
GS Group vows to diversify business portfolio
GS Chairman Huh Chang-soo urged the group to diversify its business portfolio and make attempts to explore new markets.
“With the uncertainty growing over the management environment, we should diversify profit-oriented platforms by making drastic investments and explore new business opportunities and new markets by encouraging (employees) to make various attempts,” they said during their New Year's address delivered at a meeting at GS Tower in Seoul.
Citing the unfavorable political situation in markets around the world, Huh asked GS executives to establish a new corporate culture for the group that would evolve through self-reflection.
“To overcome the hardship we are facing today and to make a leap forward, we need to have some time for introspection,” they said.
The nation's ninth-largest conglomerate has been focusing on energy, retail and construction, but has been seeking merger and acquisition opportunities to widen its business portfolio.
SK vows to achieve deep change
SK Group Chairman Chey Tae-won on Monday emphasized creating new values through change, as the firm's management policy for this year, in their New Year's speech.
“We must strive for deep change on innovation and dynamism,” Chey said at the New Year's meeting held in SK Networks' Sheraton Grande Walkerhill Hotel in Gwangjin-gu
Chey pinpointed three factors -- self-motivation, enhanced business management and innovative business models -- as prerequisite for “deep change.”
The conglomerate also promised to give more back to society.
Meanwhile, alongside Chairman Chey, SK Group Vice Chairman Chey Jae-won and SK Chemicals Vice Chairman Chey Chang-won became this year's first three new members to join the donor club Honor Society.
Lotte calls for innovation, ethical management
Lotte Group Chairman Shin Dong-bin began the year with an address emphasizing “bold innovation and change” for the company's survival in the face of difficult business conditions.
Shin called on Lotte to focus on improving its core capabilities and advantages by conducting operations focused on on-site supervision rather than depending on the group's central control tower.
They said each of Lotte's affiliates will have to create a strategy to prepare for coming “mega-trends” including the “fourth industrial revolution based on new information technology such as artificial intelligence and virtual reality” as well as the erosion of borders between online and offline channels, and “changing demographics such as the low birth rate and aging (population).”
After a tumultuous year of raids by prosecutors and parliamentary hearings, Shin also said Lotte needs to achieve “law-abiding management based on a healthy corporate philosophy.”
To be loved and respected by the Korean community, ethical management must be accompanied by corporate social responsibility making the company “grow together with society,” they said.
Kumho Asiana hopes to rebuild group
Kumho Asiana Group's goal for 2017 is to become a “leader of the fourth industrial society,” according to the new year's address given by Chairman Park Sam-koo.
In addition to completing the “last task” of buying back Kumho Tire from creditors to rebuild their Kumho Asiana Group, the chairperson said that it was imperative for the group to make preparations for big changes coming to Korea's business environment.
“By the fourth industrial society, I mean a society that has undergone great changes in its industrial structure through the convergence of digital and analog, manufacturing and information communications technology, and online and offline,” they said.
Park urged the group's affiliate companies to rethink their operational structures and to adopt a bottom-up mindset for creating new strategies in the face of changing business climates.
In particular, Park said that the group would need to strive to collect, manage, and build meaningful uses for big data. “Using big data, we can make decision-making processes more efficient and automatic,” they said.

NIAMEY - Two African migrants died of thirst and 80 were saved after they were stranded in the Niger desert while trying to reach Europe, the International Office of Migrations (IOM) said Tuesday, in the second Sahara rescue drama in less than a month.
“Last Saturday, 80 migrants were saved in the desert, 382 kilometres (237 miles) from the town of Agadez,” the IOM's Niger office said on Facebook.
“Sadly, two others died from extreme dehydration.”
The migrants had been heading to Libya, the crossing point for the hazardous voyage to Europe,when their vehicle broke down and they were “abandoned by their smugglers,” the OIM said.
They were stranded for three days before help arrived.
The agency says it has helped to save more than 3,000 people this year through search-and-rescue teams, run with Nigerien NGOs, which comb the desert for stranded migrants.
On May 22, the OIM, a UN-related organisation, said 386 migrants had been picked up in a rescue operation the previous week between Arlit and Assamaka, a town on the border with Algeria.
Niger has become one of the main routes for poor migrants heading north to the Mediterranean coast in the hope of crossing to Europe.
The Saharan route is notorious for its dangers, which include breakdowns, lack of water and callous traffickers who abandon migrants in the desert.
In 2015, Niger introduced a law making people-smuggling punishable by a jail term of up to 30 years. The armed forces, for their part, have also stepped up patrols in the desert.
However, these measures seem to have had little effect on the trafficking, and may have prompted smugglers to use more dangerous off-road tracks to avoid interception.

HOUSTON -- As the Houston Texans started their offseason program on Monday, defensive end J.J. Watt said they feel like he's in the right place physically and mentally and that he's ready to be back on the field again.
"I feel very good," Watt said. "My body feels really good so I'm really looking forward to this whole offseason process and OTAs and just getting back to just playing football. I think that's the biggest thing. I just want to play football."
Watt said any physical limitations on what they can do this offseason as well as once the season starts will be up to the Texans' coaches and training staff, but that they will be smarter about the number of reps they take going forward.
"I think they'll probably put some sort of plan in place just to limit overall reps throughout the season," Watt said. "Obviously there's a ton of reps during the season, the game reps being the most important ones, the ones that affect the result. But it mostly comes down to my workouts and making sure that I'm very smart in my workouts ... creating a plan where I don't put myself at risk."
"You can't really control what happens on the field. What I can control is my workouts. I can control what I'm doing in the weight room and what I'm doing on the practice field to make sure that I limit all of those risks. So that's what we control. We control the things we can control and then you go out there and you play and you just let it fly and obviously hope for the best."
J.J. Watt says their body feels "very good" after two surgeries on their back last year. They said they plan to be "very smart" with their workouts going forward to avoid injury risk. Bob Levey/Getty Images
In 2016, Watt had surgery on their back in late July, but was back on the field for the regular-season opener just more than a month later. After the Texans' Week 3 loss to the New England Patriots, the Texans put them on injured reserve after they re-aggravated the injury. Watt missed the rest of the season and said going through the recovery for the surgeries has taught them that they need to make sure they are not doing too much.
"I'm very, very excited, there's no question about that," Watt said. "You're away from the game for a year, like I've said many, many times before it reaffirms how much you love it, how passionate you are about it, how badly you want to go out and play with your teammates and just enjoy the game.
"But I've also learned a lot over that time of where I need to make sure that I balance myself and not get overly crazy in the offseason and things like that. So I think it's been a really good time for me but it's definitely time for me to start playing some football again, that's for sure."
KARACHI, Aug. 14 (APP): The Pakistan Navy has launched the
national campaign for mangroves plantation.
A PN statement issued here on Monday said that `Pakistan
Navy-Mangroves Plantation Campaign 2017′ has been launched in
the Coastal Areas of Sindh and Balochistan provinces on the eve
of Independence Day.
Chief of the Naval Staff, Admiral Muhammad Zakaullah, was the
chief guest on the occasion and inaugurated Pakistan Navy Mangroves
Plantation Campaign by planting sapling of Mangroves.
The Campaign entails an effort to plant over one Million
Mangroves in the Coastal Areas of Sindh and Balochistan provinces.
While speaking on the occasion, Chief of the Naval Staff
highlighted that deforestation of mangroves has not only affected
biodiversity of our coastal areas but also livelihoods of coastal
communities.
Admiral Muhammad Zakaullah elaborated that these campaigns will
not only increase the Mangrove forest cover but will also play a key
role in awareness of masses about the importance of these forests.
The Naval Chief emphasized all the relevant Federal, Provincial
institutions and all sections of the society to join hands for this
noble cause.
Emphasizing the importance of mangroves the Naval Chief announced
that the name of the campaign be changed to National Campaign for
Mangroves Plantation 2017.

will value it and we will perform our duties with complete honesty and
we all will contribute in making this country greater'.
Mangroves are vital to coastal ecosystem, prevention of sea
intrusion and sustainment of marine life. Unfortunately over the
years, Mangroves along the Pakistani coast have diminished due to
negligence and apathy of all concerned.
Being a major stakeholder of the maritime domain and realizing
the importance of mangroves for marine life, Pakistan Navy has taken a
major initiative to revive Mangrove forests all along the coast.
Realizing the importance of Mangroves forests in combating
pollution, countering coastal erosion and providing a number of
economic and financial opportunities to coastal communities, Pakistan
Navy in line with the vision of the Federal Government regularly under
takes Mangroves Plantation Campaigns.
Over one Million Mangroves saplings were planted last year with
the collaboration of Forest Departments of Sindh & Balochistan,
International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) and World
Wildlife Fund (WWF).
Through these campaigns, not only more forests are raised but
also the existing Mangroves forests can be conserved.
The inauguration ceremony was attended by a large number of
senior military and civil officials including representatives from
business community, journalists, World Wildlife Fund (WWF),
International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), officials from
Federal and Provincial Forest Departments.

David Goffin recovered from 5-2 down in the first set and won 10 of the next 11 games to set up a 7-5, 6-1 win over Richard Gasquet on Friday, advancing to a Japan Open semifinal against Diego Schwartzman.
Goffin, the runner-up in Japan last year, has been on a winning run in Asia after claiming their first title in three years last weekend at Shenzhen, China.
Schwartzman's match against Steve Johnson was played with the roof closed. Yet despite a forecast for heavy, persistent rain throughout the rest of the day, officials decided to start Goffin's match with the roof open, only to close it again with Gasquet leading 3-2 in the first.
Goffin struggled to regain their rhythm after the 15-minute delay and quickly needed to save three set points, with Gasquet on serve at 40-0 in the ninth game.
The Belgian player hung on to break serve, and then held in their next to go on a roll. The pair could meet again next month when Gasquet's French team hosts Belgium in the Davis Cup final.
Friday's win moved Goffin to No. 11 in the Emirates ATP Race to London rankings. With Novak Djokovic and Stan Wawrinka ruled out for the season, 10th place will be enough to secure a place at the end-of-season showpiece.
Earlier, Schwartzman defeated Sam Johnson 6-0, 7-5 to register their career-high 32nd match win of the season.
"In the beginning it was really nice for me," said Schwartzman. "Then they started to improve and tried to change their game. They started to serve better, got their first serve in, and became more aggressive, coming to the net a few times more.
"I was on the defensive many times and couldn't dominate."
Vladmir Duthiers has moved from helping Anderson Cooper navigate Haiti to assisting a nation eager to learn about the growing crisis in North Korea.
In tonight's 10 p.m. eastern broadcast of the fledgling series “CBSN: On Assignment,” Duthiers will examine a topic that has started to weigh on many minds in recent days: how the U.S. military might grapple with a North Korean that has grown increasingly antagonistic, prompted in part by statements from U.S. officials. Duthiers in July gained access to U.S. military bases in Guam, South Korea and Hawaii.
While the topic is in the center of the current news cycle, Duthiers and their producers began to ponder how to tackle it as the Trump administration took over from its predecessors. “President Obama had stressd to President-elect Trump that North Korean was going to be the greatest foreign policy challenge of their presidency – perhaps even the greatest challenge of their presidency overall,” Duthiers recalled in an interview. “We realized what we really wanted to do is look at h ow America was prepared in the event of a conflict with the North.” They spent about two weeks in July traveling to the bases in relatively short order.
Producers at CBS News hope the report draws more notice to the “On Assignment” series, which is CBS' attempt to draw more notice to some of the enterprise reporting that is becoming more a part of its CBSN streaming-video outlet. “This has become one platform for CBS to be able to do some long-form storytelling, but to do it in a modern immersive way,” said Mosheh Oinounou, executive producer of the series, which is in the third week of a four-episode run.
This isn't Duthiers' first trip overseas. They have explored volatile suburbs around Paris and Brussels in the wake of terrorism for documentaries shown first on CBSN. All the while, they have anchored the daily CBSN breaking-news stream and contributed to traditional TV shows like “CBS This Morning.”
They pivoted to TV news after spending two decades on Wall Street. While working as an unpaid intern for CNN after going to journalism school, they made an impression on Anderson Cooper, who later enlisted Duthiers (and their facility in speaking Haitian Creole) to help them with production duties on a long sojourn to Haiti in 2010 to examine the results of a devastating earthquake there. They later secured a position as an international correspondent for CNN, working out of Lagos, Nigeria.
“On Assignment” is meant to burnish the notion of so-called “experiential journalism,” the type of you-are-hear reportage that has also become a staple of Vice Media's HBO programs or ABC's “Nightline.” While the format is gaining more traction as traditional news outlets vie for the attention of a generation of viewers more accustomed to kinetic video on their smartphones, Duthiers pointed out anchors have been doing this stuff for years. “I've seen clips – Walter Cronkite was doing the exact same thing during the space race of the 1960s,” said Duthiers. “He's literally in this harness and spinning, upside down, as they tried to experience what it's like for an American astronaut to be weightless.”
CBS hopes the idea will prompt viewers to tie themselves down to CBSN, no matter the format. “We are trying to break down the fourth wall, and be really transparent with the viewer about what we are seeing, what we are feeling,” said Oinounou, the executive producer. “And take them along for the ride.”

The heat is on ... 2018 has been designated the Year of the Pepper, but there's more to this vegetable than just fire.
If you're wondering who decides this, Fleuroselect Home Garden Association, an international non-profit organisation, chooses a vegetable and flower each year, designed to boost seed and plant sales.
Seedsman Mr Fothergill's wants gardeners to forget about the fire and explore the wide range of flavours in the chilli kingdom.
If you don't like the heat, growing the world's hottest chilli isn't going to be your thing, but the capsicum family has something for everyone.
Mr Fothergill's trials manager, Alison Mulvaney, said: “The recent introduction of Capsicum annuum Biquino Yellow is a perfect example of a chilli chosen for flavour not heat. This mild Brazilian pepper carries an interesting smoky flavour with just a little heat to add a mild spice and aroma to any dish.”
Apart from C. annuum, mild Peruvian ‘Aji' chillies are favourites with chefs at the moment. These Capsicum baccatum varieties produce an abundance of medium-sized chillies with a sweet, fruity flavour laid over a mild to medium heat.
Havana Gold is new for this season and is a good introduction to the Ajis, providing a complex fruity flavour and manageable, mild heat.
Capsicum chinense is the dominant species in the Caribbean, with fiery habaneros and Scotch bonnets bringing a balance of sweet, sour and fruitiness to dishes along with intense heat. There are also varieties that carry the pungent flavours with no heat, such as Trinidad Perfume.
For more information, visit www.mr.fothergills.co.uk.
* The heat of a chilli is measured on The Scoville Scale in Scoville heat units (SHU), or capsaicin concentration, named after its creator, US pharmacist Wilbur Scoville.
SHU values range from 0 in a sweet bell pepper to 2,000,000-2,200,000 in a Trinidad Moruga Scorpion, or Carolina Reaper.
CHILLI LOCO
I'm no fan of hot chillies, but Loco is compact (about 2ft), bushy and covered with inch-long cone-shaped fruits held above the foliage like little fairy lights.
The fruits start purple/cream, changing from orange to red – the look like plump blackcurrants. Despite its name, Loco is not that hot, slightly less than a cayenne pepper, a medium heat level of about 24,000 SHU.
Which Gardening Chilli Trials 2012 recommended it as a Best Buy and it is UK bred, so makes an excellent plant for the patio.
You'll find it at Thompson & Morgan, Suttons, Sea Spring Seeds, The Eden Project, Dobies and DT Brown Seeds.

This is because of their efforts and coordination that department is flourishing and prospering day by day.
Old Faithful is Yellowstone National Park's most famous landmark. Millions of visitors come to the park every year to see the geyser erupt every 44-125 minutes. But despite Old Faithful's fame, relatively little was known about the geologic anatomy of the structure and the fluid pathways that fuel the geyser below the surface. Until now.
University of Utah scientists have mapped the near-surface geology around Old Faithful, revealing the reservoir of heated water that feeds the geyser's surface vent and how the ground shaking behaves in between eruptions. The map was made possible by a dense network of portable seismographs and by new seismic analysis techniques. The results are published in Geophysical Research Letters. Doctoral student Sin-Mei Wu is the first author.
For Robert Smith, a long-time Yellowstone researcher and distinguished research professor of geology and geophysics, the study is the culmination of more than a decade of planning and comes as they celebrate their 60th year working in America's first national park.
“Here's the iconic geyser of Yellowstone,” Smith says. “It's known around the world, but the complete geologic plumbing of Yellowstone's Upper Geyser Basin has not been mapped nor have we studied how the timing of eruptions is related to precursor ground tremors before eruptions.”
Small seismometers
Old Faithful is an iconic example of a hydrothermal feature, and particularly of the features in Yellowstone National Park, which is underlain by two active magma reservoirs at depths of 5 to 40 km depth that provide heat to the overlying near-surface groundwater. In some places within Yellowstone, the hot water manifests itself in pools and springs. In others, it takes the form of explosive geysers.
Dozens of structures surround Old Faithful, including hotels, a gift shop and a visitor's center. Some of these buildings, the Park Service has found, are built over thermal features that result in excessive heat beneath the built environment. As part of their plan to manage the Old Faithful area, the Park Service asked University of Utah scientists to conduct a geologic survey of the area around the geyser.
For years, study co-authors Jamie Farrell and Fan-Chi Lin, along with Smith, have worked to characterize the magma reservoirs deep beneath Yellowstone. Although geologists can use seismic data from large earthquakes to see features deep in the earth, the shallow subsurface geology of the park has remained a mystery, because mapping it out would require capturing everyday miniature ground movement and seismic energy on a much smaller scale. “We try to use continuous ground shaking produced by humans, cars, wind, water and Yellowstone's hydrothermal boilings and convert it into our signal,” Lin says. “We can extract a useful signal from the ambient background ground vibration.”
To date, the University of Utah has placed 30 permanent seismometers around the park to record ground shaking and monitor for earthquakes and volcanic events. The cost of these seismometers, however, can easily exceed $10,000. Small seismometers, developed by Fairfield Nodal for the oil and gas industry, reduce the cost to less than $2,000 per unit. They're small white canisters about six inches high and are totally autonomous and self-contained. “You just take it out and stick it in the ground,” Smith says.
In 2015, with the new instruments, the Utah team deployed 133 seismometers in the Old Faithful and Geyser Hill areas for a two-week campaign.
The sensors picked up bursts of intense seismic tremors around Old Faithful, about 60 minutes long, separated by about 30 minutes of quiet. When Farrell presents these patterns, they often ask audiences at what point they think the eruption of Old Faithful takes place. Surprisingly, it's not at the peak of shaking. It's at the end, just before everything goes quiet again.
After an eruption, the geyser's reservoir fills again with hot water, Farrell explains. “As that cavity fills up, you have a lot of hot pressurized bubbles,” they say. “When they come up, they cool off really rapidly and they collapse and implode.” The energy released by those implosions causes the tremors leading up to an eruption.
One scientist‘s noise is another scientist's signal
Typically, researchers create a seismic signal by swinging a hammer onto a metal plate on the ground. Lin and Wu developed the computational tools that would help find useful signals among the seismic noise without disturbing the sensitive environment in the Upper Geyser Basin. Wu says they were able to use the hydrothermal features themselves as a seismic source, to study how seismic energy propagates by correlating signals recorded at the sensor close to a persistent source to other sensors. “It's amazing that you can use the hydrothermal source to observe the structure here,” they say.
When analyzing data from the seismic sensors, the researchers noticed that tremor signals from Old Faithful were not reaching the western boardwalk. Seismic waves extracted from another hydrothermal feature in the north slowed down and scattered significantly in nearly the same area suggesting somewhere west of Old Faithful was an underground feature that affects the seismic waves in an anomalous way. With a dense network of seismometers, the team could determine the shape, size, and location of the feature, which they believe is Old Faithful's hydrothermal reservoir.
Wu estimates that the reservoir, a network of cracks and fractures through which water flows, has a diameter of around 200 meters, a little larger than the University of Utah's Rice-Eccles Stadium, and can hold approximately 300,000 cubic meters of water, or more than 79 million gallons. By comparison, each eruption of Old Faithful releases around 30 m3 of water, or nearly 8,000 gallons. “Although it's a rough estimation, we were surprised that it was so large,” Wu says.
Further work
The team is far from done answering questions about Yellowstone. They returned for another seismic survey in November 2016 and are planning their 2017 deployment, to begin after the park roads close for the winter. Wu is looking at how air temperature might change the subsurface structure and affect the propagation of seismic waves. Farrell is using the team's seismic data to predict how earthquake waves might reverberate through the region. Smith is looking forward to conducting similar analysis in Norris Geyser Basin, the hottest geothermal area of the park. Lin says that the University of Utah's research program in Yellowstone owes much to Smith's decades-long relationship with the park, enabling new discoveries. “You need new techniques,” Lin says, “but also those long-term relationships.”

MOUNT PLEASANT, S.C. — It wasn't the Easter bunny that startled a South Carolina homeowner and their family. It wasn't even a burglar.
The Post and Courier of Charleston reports Susie and Steve Polston were worried that someone was trying to get into their home on Sunday. Instead, Polston's 16-year-old son found the intruder: a nine-foot alligator crawling on their second-story porch.
The family says the alligator climbed a back stairwell to the porch, crunched through the aluminum screen door and nestled between a sofa and a swinging bench.
State law requires a nuisance-trapped alligator to be killed, but the family didn't want that. The other choice was to wait it out, but the alligator was eventually euthanized.
Last year, an alligator rang a doorbell, while another fell asleep on a porch.
A swarm of trucks and helicopters dumped 30 tons of rock per hour onto the eroded hillside that formed the Oroville dam's emergency spillway. One quarry worked around the clock to mine boulders as heavy as 6 tons. An army of workers mixed concrete slurry to help seal the rocks in place.
“This is an aggressive proactive attack to address the erosion,” said Bill Croyle, acting director of the state Department of Water Resources. “There's a lot of people, a lot of equipment, a lot of materials moving around, from the ground and from the air.”
At the main spillway, a different and riskier operation was underway: Despite a large hole in the concrete chute, officials have been sending a massive amount of the swollen reservoir's water down the chute to the Feather River in a desperate attempt to reduce the lake's level.
This effort has lowered the amount of water the spillway could handle, the structure continued to hold Tuesday without sustaining more significant damage, officials said.
The idea is to get the reservoir water level low enough that it can take in rain from an upcoming series of storms without reaching capacity. If the reservoir filled up again, water would automatically flow down the emergency spillway, which on Sunday appeared to be nearing collapse, forcing the evacuation of more than 100,000 people downstream.
Crews releasing 100,000 cubic feet of water per second through the main spillway lowered the lake's levels by about one foot per hour without causing more damage to the main spillway, engineers said. Meanwhile, hundreds of construction workers used thousands of tons of concrete and rock to shore up the erosion that had carved fissures into the unpaved slope behind the dam.
The reservoir's water line is expected to fall 50 feet by late Saturday or early Sunday, providing a buffer capacity of half a million acre feet, officials said. That would avert the risk of using the eroded hillside as an emergency spillway again, officials believe.
National Security Minister, Rayburn Blackmoore, has dismissed reports of unhealthy working conditions at the island's courts and the Registry since the passing of Hurricane Maria last September.
They said they have not received or read any report concerning poor working environment.
“This government would never expose its people to any environment that is not conducive to work,” they stated. “There were challenges and I am not aware of any report.”
Last week a group of attorneys paraded through Roseau to deliver a letter to Blackmoore on the conditions of the courts which they say have not been fully operational since the hurricane.
They also expressed concerns over the conditions at the Registry, saying they need to be improved.
But according to Blackmoore, emphasis should be placed on the fact that the Registry has been providing services since Maria and not on negativity.
“After a major phenomenon like Hurricane Maria, the Registry has been providing all the services and I think that is what that should be given currency and not this negative and outcasting aspersions,” they stated.
They said “due diligence” was done to make sure there were no health hazards at the building and inspections and reports have been produced since business restarted there.
“We've asked for reports to be done for every government building and I think that is only natural after a major hurricane like Maria, the responsible thing to do is to ask for proper reports, and that was requested,” Blackmoore remarked. “I am saying to you that I have not read, I have not heard of any reports that speak to a cancer environment.”
Meanwhile, Registrar Ossie Walsh said there have been no recent complaints from staff at the Registry.
“From a physical standpoint, where we were in terms of the environment at the Registry, where we are a great difference,” they stated. “The place has been cleaned up, the place has been sanitized, it is a vast improvement,” they noted.”Persons, members of staff who did have complaints about itchy skin at one time, burning eyes, there is no such complaint currently at the Registry.”

We've tested nearly half a dozen first-gen EcoBoost Mustangs around here, so we're pretty familiar with how the car drives and performs. The 2018 model, a midlife refresh, has picked up a 10-speed automatic, an extra 30 lb-ft of torque, and a whole lot more attitude.
To date, the EcoBoost-equipped Mustang has been a confident performer, especially equipped with the optional Performance package. In a comparison test against the turbo four-cylinder Camaro, I wrote it “can be driven as fast as its motor will carry it down a winding road with complete confidence.” Apparently, that's too tame for the Mustang engineering team. This new car drives like it has something to prove.
It's obvious the moment you start driving the car hard. The optional limited-slip differential locks up aggressively, and the optional summer tires don't always have the grip to handle it. You must be careful with the throttle in tight corners; it will try to put all 350 lb-ft down at once and pop you sideways. Leave the stability control on until you're familiar with the car because it'll let you rotate more than you expect before it steps in. This car now requires a delicate touch. Manhandling it turns a race horse into a bucking bronco.
You can make life easier on yourself by staying away from the Sport+ and Race driving modes. Both make the throttle hyperaggressive and the steering too heavy, making it needlessly difficult to drive the car smoothly. Those modes also lock out the selectable steering settings, so you can't customize the car to your taste. Sport or Custom modes are best but don't let you change the firmness of the optional magnetorheological dampers, which work best in Sport+ and Race. In Sport and Custom, they leave the car underdamped and a little too bouncy for serious driving.
The new 10-speed auto is one thing that doesn't need fixing on the street. On our favorite roads, it was perfect. Even with its software update, the EcoBoost still runs out of breath at high rpm, but you wouldn't know it because this transmission knows exactly how to use all its gears to keep the engine in the meat of its power. That include both shifting at the horsepower peak and downshifting under braking so you're right at the torque peak when you're ready to accelerate out of the corner.
Regardless of which mode you prefer or how you dial in the settings, there's no denying the EcoBoost Mustang is damn quick on a back road once you figure out how to drive it right. It's a sweaty-palms experience, but it'll surprise a lot of fast cars.
This was born out at the test track, as well. At 5.3 seconds to 60 mph and 13.9 seconds in the quarter at 97.2 mph, this is the quickest EcoBoost Mustang we've ever tested and nicely reverses a trend we discovered and reported of EcoBoost Mustangs getting slower. Our test team found Drag Strip mode, unsurprisingly, returned the best results, though it surprisingly doesn't have launch control. A little brake torque up to 1,500 rpm netted the best launch. If you're curious, the last V-8 Mustang we tested hit 60 mph in 4.4 seconds and ran a 12.6-second quarter mile at 115.1 mph.
We've long praised the EcoBoost Mustang's braking for being stronger and more precise than you'd expect in what is now the base model, and this one is no exception. Its stop from 60 mph in 106 feet is right on par with its predecessors.
Things didn't go so well in our handling tests, though. Pulling 0.96 g on the skidpad and lapping the figure eight in 25.1 seconds at 0.75 g average, it did about as well as the last EcoBoost with an automatic transmission we tested. Thing is, it's significantly slower and pulling a lot less g than the best EcoBoost Mustang we've tested, and it's not just the numbers. The test team reports things started out all right, with great braking, good road holding, and strong traction coming off the corners, but the laps were still nearly a second off the pace. Going for another try, everything “went pear-shaped,” as the notes have it. “Times did not improve, and the transmission started really hiccupping,” our test team wrote. “A couple of times, after pulling the paddle for a downshift, it literally freewheeled, no throttle response, as if it was in neutral. Then it popped into second and the revs jumped (no matched revving), and it totally upset the car. Also, I don't think the LSD was working properly because going to throttle at the same rate in the same place spun the car once—a really slo-mo spin, but still it was a surprise.” No doubt, our Figure Eight test is very hard on cars, but these sorts of things don't usually happen.
The test team's notes end with, “Feels like a good eight-tenths car, but ask ten-tenths and it won't like it.” Which, really, kind of jibes with our road impressions. Although we had no mechanical issues on the road, the car did not like to be driven to within an inch of its capability. My own notes read, verbatim: “This thing grabs you by the collar and screams in your face, ‘I'm sporty, mother******!' It's like trying to wheel a classic Mustang hard. You've gotta know what you're doing.”
Harping on the handling aside, there are a few other aspects of the 2018 refresh to talk about. My favorite is the optional digital dash, which has a lot of cool graphics and a different skin for every drive mode. My only request would be a more intuitive user interface, as there are multiple buttons on the steering wheel and dash that control it and it takes a while to figure out how to access all the hidden menus. Similarly, I'd like to know if there's some hidden volume control for the parking sensors. They're painfully loud.
The standard seats are as deserving of praise as the digital dash. They're plenty supportive for back road shenanigans and still quite comfortable for the daily commute. The optional leather isn't the fanciest stuff on the market, but it's very nice for a non-luxury vehicle.
As long as we're talking fancy stuff, we ought to address the green elephant in the room. Our EcoBoost Premium tester priced out at $39,880, and a lot of you will be quick to point out you can have a V-8 for that money. That's certainly true, and if your priorities are power and exhaust note, there's no reason not to. Of course, if you want these heated and cooled seats, the navigation system, the digital dash, the dampers, etc. on your V-8, it's going to cost you plenty more than $40,000. The GT Premium starts at 40 grand, after all. If you're looking to balance performance and features, the EcoBoost isn't a bad way to go.
The 2018 Ford Mustang EcoBoost, at least when equipped with the Performance package, is not the docile base car you might expect. It's not even the bargain sports car it used to be. It's an ornery foal waiting to be broken to the saddle, and you have to respect that. It used to be that people looked down on base-engine Mustangs, but anyone who dismisses the 2018 EcoBoost out of hand hasn't driven one.
Bradley Lowery has scored a success after scooping Match of the Day's Goal of the Month title.
The five-year-old Blackhall boy, a keen Sunderland fan, has been awarded the honour jointly with Manchester United star Henrikh Mkhitaryan - ironically for a goal against the Black Cats.
We can't actually believe this and would like to thank every single one of you for your support. Gemma Lowery
Bradley's goal - scored when they were mascot at Sunderland's game against Chelsea - was cheered by football fans everywhere.
That moment, in the warm-up to the game at the Stadium of Light on Wednesday, December 14, has also been listed as former England and Newcastle United star Alan Shearer's top moments of 2016.
Before Christmas, Bradley's family was told hisneuroblastoma cancer which has returned cannot be beaten.
Treatment which aims to give them as much time as possible is due to start later this month, using some of the £700,000 funds raised by supporters for specialist drugs.
In between Christmas and New Year Bradley, who lives with mum Gemma, dad Carl and brother Kieron, enjoyed a visit the Warner Bros Harry Potter Studio Tour in London thanks to Sunderland AFC.
Now the family are set to visit Disneyland Paris through Make a Wish.
Gemma said: “We have waked up this morning to the news that Bradley's goal got joint goal of the month.
“We can't actually believe this and would like to thank every single one of you for your support.
“This is a very special moment for us and something we can treasure forever.
“The plan for the next few days is to have some family chill time before we go back to hospital on Friday to get Bradley's bloods checked.
“On January 16, Bradley will start their new treatment that they will get at the Royal Victoria Infirmary in Newcastle.
“We will be funding this treatment with the money that has been raised for them as this is a trial that is currently in America and not yet in the UK.
“We are delighted that Bradley's consultant has agreed to give them this treatment instead of having to travel for it as the staff from the RVI are absolutely amazing and I wouldn't want anyone else looking after him.
“We are very nervous about this new treatment as we are not sure if Bradley's body is strong enough to cope with it and there are some awful side effects but we need to try and miracles can happen.”
Henrikh Mkhitaryan's goal in the 3-0 victory against Sunderland on Boxing Day took the joint Goal of the Month title with Bradley.
Others in the running were Arsenal striker Alexis Sanchez for a goal they scored in the side's 5-1 win at West Ham on Saturday, December 3; Jeff Hendrick's goal for Burnley against Bournemouth at home on Saturday, December 10; Hal Robson Kanu's winning shot in West Brom's 2-1 win against Southampton on New Year's Eve; Wilfried Zaha's goal for Crystal Palace when their team won 2-1 at Hull on Saturday, December 10; a Steve Cook goal for Bournmouth when their side drew 3-3 against Liverpool on Sunday, December 4; Marc Muniesa's goal for Stoke during a 2-0 home game against Burnley on Saturday, December 3; and Sofiane Boufal of Southamption's goal against Middlesbrough in a 1-0 home win on Sunday, December 11.
LAHORE - SSGC and Wapda joined NBP and PIA in the semifinals of the 63rd Zaitoon National Hockey Championship here at the National Hockey Stadium on Sunday.
Army remained unlucky for the second time, as despite registering a 7-1 victory, they couldn't make to the semifinals. Two days ago, Army had to contend with a 2-2 draw against Wapda, after conceding a last minute equaliser. Today, they had to beat SNGPL with a six goal margin and then see Wapda losing to SSGC in the last encounter. The soldiers did their job magnificently, defeating SNGPL 7-1. However, later, Wapda achieved the minimum requirement to move to last four, after drawing 2-2 with SSGC.
Army trounced SNGPL 7-1 in the first match of the day. The first 15 minutes were no indicator of the events to come. Both the sides had phases of ascendancy and entered the opposition's circle but there was no attempt on the goal. The second quarter was electrifying. First five minutes witnessed as many attempts from either side. Last 10 minutes were completely dominated by the soldiers. On their first penalty corner, the ball remained in the circle for some time with a little ping pong.
Eventually, promising forward Nauman netted it by flicking a risen ball. Soon, a good attack saw a parallel pass near the goal line on circle's left side availed by well positioned Abbas. Army made it 3-0 in the 29th minute. Yasir sprinted into the circle and their seemingly weak push surprisingly went in off a defender's stick.
The young SNGPL, making their debut at the nationals, rallied well in the third quarter. They had more goal scoring opportunities though, yet only one was availed. Dawood beautifully first timed a good ball into the circle.
With only two goals ahead, and 15 minutes left, Army's hopes to keep the semi final dream alive were fading. In the 50th minute, after a wonderful run along the right flank, ball was back passed to Nauman, who had all the time to make it 4-1. Fifth goal was a mirror image of the previous. Hence, Nauman completed their hat trick. An excellent one touch move found Jabbar slotting the ball into the goal from a close range. Army, 6-1 up, required one more to achieve the objective. It came to the final minute, as an excellent M Rizwan Senior long ball was well trapped on the left flank. An equally good feed in was pushed into the cage by Jabbar again.
SSGC drew with Wapda 2-2 in the last match of the Pool B. Wapda held onto semifinal spot by skin of their teeth. For Wapda, the minimum requirement was a draw. SSGC, already qualified, still went for a victory and it was a competitive match throughout.
Wapda started in earnest and had the upper hand most of the first quarter; made two good attempts on the goal apart from earning two penalty corners. But it finished 0-0. Wapda's Asad Bashir scored after receiving an excellent flat backhander from the left. SSGC made an instant comeback; not only equalising but going ahead within the next two minutes. Rizwan Ali's inch perfect long pass was shot into the net by Naveed Alam in the flash of an eye. Then Rana Sohail sent in an excellent diagonal through ball from the left. Adeel was brought down by the advancing goalkeeper. Umpire had no hesitation in pointing to the penalty stroke spot. Abbas Haider sent the goalkeeper the wrong way - it was 2-1 in favour of SSGC.
But soon, the SSGC had a severe setback, Adnan Maqsood had to leave the field after receiving a nasty injury to nose. Wapda were now faster in their attacks but SSGC defended well. Their net minder Amjad Ali affected a couple of fines saves.
Wapda entered veteran Waseem early in the second half. They exerted sustained pressure with good moves. After the fourth penalty corner was dramatically deflected away by the line stopper, the leveller arrived off the next PC in the 43rd minute. Aleem Bilal's stinger thundered against the top left of the net.
The absorbing battle continued in the last 15 minutes with both the sides going forward. However, SSGC had the only real opportunity. Their only penalty corner of the day was well cleared by the line stopper. It ended 2-2, much to the relief of Wapda.

The CW drama series The 100 is back for its fifth season, with Clarke (Eliza Taylor) struggling to survive on Earth while their friends in space think they may have finally figured out a way to get back to the ground. At the same time, a new ship of prisoners – this time made up of some really bad criminals – has landed and is led by a woman (Ivana Milicevic) whose motives do not immediately reveal themselves, but clearly are a threat to anyone that crosses their path.
During this 1-on-1 phone interview with Collider, showrunner Jason Rothenberg talked about what fans can expect from Season 5, how this season started to take shape, why the six-year time jump provides a bit of a reboot, the challenges of the premiere episode, the threat of this new group of prisoners, the eventual reunion between Clarke and Bellamy (Bob Morley), which character has had the biggest character journey in the six years that have passed, the biggest threat in Season 5, and their plan for the series, going forward. Be aware that there are some spoilers discussed.
Collider: How close does this season look to you what you thought it might look like, if you actually got to this point?
JASON ROTHENBERG: When we first started, when I wrote the pilot, I was just trying to get a series order. I hadn't thought about anything. I knew there were people on Earth, obviously. We had the spear come out of the woods and kill Jasper. They literally are dead in the pilot script. That didn't end up happening and that spear barely missed their heart. So, I knew there were survivors on the ground, but I didn't have any idea what that culture was. Ultimately, I fairly quickly began to build out the world and what it was. Every season, as I'm breaking, with the writers, the season that's currently being produced, I'm always thinking about what the next season is, so that we can begin to plant the seeds of what that might be. That way, the ending can take us there. And also, to keep it creatively interesting for me, I like to change it up, radically, every season. But we're beyond the point that I initially envisioned, as an end point, at this moment. That's fine. It's elongated, in terms of where the story's going now. Wait till you see where it goes, at the end of Season 5. We're talking about a change that will make the last change look like nothing. It's really, really exciting, where it could potentially continue to go, and that's how we keep it interesting for all of us, and the audience, too.
Are you at a point where you have to think about how much further, realistically, you see the show going? Do you have a plan for a certain amount of seasons more, or are you taking it season by season?
ROTHENBERG: Well, yes and no. I definitely feel like I have a plan in mind. I'm not gonna say what the plan is, at this point, but it does have this nice ability to elongate, and by that, I mean we can push that out, as far as we need to or as far as we're lucky to. I'm not sure how much more I have in me. Its been a very, very long run. I feel like I've been blessed in playing with winnings, as they say in the casino, for awhile. At some point, it's a business decision, as much as it is a creative one. I also don't want the show to stick around, past its sell by date. I feel like, as of now, it functions as a really great five-season show, and I have a great idea for Season 6. As long as we continue to come up with what I think are great ideas and stories I'm excited to tell, and that keep everybody inspired, then we'll keep doing it.
Does this season feel like a re-invention for you, especially as the showrunner, or does it just feel like the next step in the story?
ROTHENBERG: It feels like the next step in the story. Every season for me is so different. The story of the season is always its own unique thing. This one had some added obvious evolution, in the idea of the time jump and how different the characters can be, based on those six years spent changing while we were away, so in that way, it is a little bit of a reboot. It's definitely presented interesting challenges that hadn't existed in prior seasons, but there were things that we were excited about and I feel like we handled well. The audience will be the judge, but I think this season is easily one of our best.
What were the challenges you were most excited about, in doing a premiere episode with really only one actor for the majority of it, and what were the challenges that you were dreading?
ROTHENBERG: I never, ever was dreading. I always thought, “Oh, my god, this is a huge idea and it's totally unique and not like anything we've ever done before.” I feel like the idea of them being the omega woman – the last person on Earth – was baked into a cake, in terms of the way we ended Season 4. The idea of getting to play with that, and getting to see Eliza [Taylor] in that tour de force, was really exciting to me. Obviously, we all know how good they are, but I still think they haven't even scratched the surface of how good they are. This was really an opportunity to get them to shine and showcase them for 20 minutes. Not a lot of actors could pull that off. She's special.
A woman has been arrested and charged with manslaughter in the mysterious death of a Penticton teenager more than one year ago.
Kiera Bourque, 21, was scheduled to appear in Penticton provincial court Tuesday to face the charge in connection with the death of 17-year-old Devon Blackmore at a Penticton home April 2, 2017.
Police said the teen's death was initially thought to be due to a medical condition.
Bourque allegedly contacted 911 claiming their companion was in medical distress and the victim was pronounced deceased at the scene.
RCMP said upon further investigation, evidence came to light that foul play may have been involved.
In August 2017, Blackmore's death was categorized as a homicide.
WATCH BELOW: Extended interview with Devon Blackmore's mother, Lorrie Blackmore, on their son's life and untimely passing in Penticton last April.
Police did not notify the public that a homicide occurred until December 2017, eight months after the incident.
The death was only revealed when Penticton RCMP Supt. Ted De Jager was questioned by a local news outlet in a year-end interview about the number of open homicide investigations in 2017.
RCMP said due to the sensitive nature of the case and to not compromise the integrity of the investigation, few details were released to the public.
Court records show Bourque will make their next court appearance on June 20 at B.C. Provincial Court in Penticton Law Courts to consult with counsel.
The community came together for the Blackmore family following their death, raising more than $6,800 for the funeral expenses on a GoFundMe page.
Calvin Hector, a friend who played midget league hockey in Salmon Arm with Blackmore, said the news of their death was hard to believe.
“I was sitting in the middle of my math class last spring when I found out the sad news of their passing,” Hector told Global News. “Immediately I didn't want to think it was true but as I started seeing more and more memorials for Devon I knew it wasn't a mistake or something I miss-read.”
Hector remembers the 17-year-old as a well-liked young man.
“I noticed that they were never alone and that they were always in the hallways sitting with someone or striking up a conversation,” they said. “He was a really good caring guy and they are gone too soon.”
Blackmore was a Penticton Secondary School student at the time of their death.

From the most awkward moment to the biggest roadhog, Red Bull's Daniel Ricciardo reveals their end of season awards. (3:43)
Formula One's pit-to-car radio is a constant source of entertainment and amusement throughout any season. This season has been no exception. But who won our award for radio rant of the season? Read on to find out.
Fernando Alonso versus The world
ANDREJ ISAKOVIC/AFP/Getty Images
Fernando Alonso has not exactly been shy about their voicing frustrations with Honda these past few years. This year was full of the two-time world champion waxing lyrical at McLaren's engine partner, though it wasn't just Honda who got caught in the crosshairs....
"How the hell they can overtake me? 300 metres behind me at the beginning of the straight. I never raced with less power in my life."
The extent of Honda's third successive failure was laid bare in the opening races and Alonso had no problem sticking the knife in when they had the change.
"Remember your drinks..."
"I don't need f---ing drinks! There is enough concentration just to keep the car on the road."
A gentle reminder in China to stay hydrated is met with an angry response as Alonso tries to wrestle the MCL32 into the points.
"The engine feels good. Much slower than before. Amazing!"
The Spaniard delivers their finest dose of sarcasm during another frustrating session at their home race in Barcelona.
"We have embarrassing power in this mode."
Alonso comes back to earth with a bang at the Canadian Grand Prix after their heroics at the Indy 500.....

"Embarrassing. Really embarrassing."
...An opinion they maintained five races later at the Belgian Grand Prix, where the Japanese manufacturer failed to deliver promised upgrades. It was the race which appeared to finally signal the beginning of the end of the McLaren-Honda partnership.
"I don't know why they push me so much, you know? They cannot play bowling."
Their frustrations weren't limited just to their power unit, however. Here they question the driving of some of their midfield rivals after being punted off at Turn 1 in Austria.
"Where is Palmer?"
"Palmer has retired."
"Karma."
Alonso and Jolyon Palmer came to blows early on in the Italian Grand Prix. Sympathy was hard to come by when the Renault failed to make the chequered flag.
"What an idiot! Hulkenberg is right...."
Alonso makes reference to Nico Hulkenberg and Kevin Magnussen's heated exchange at the Hungarian Grand Prix -- where the Danish driver was called "the most unsporting driver on the grid" -- during a close fight in Malaysia.
Honourable mentions
Sky Sports
"Let's get the f--- out of here!"
Daniel Ricciardo's season started in frustrating circumstances at the opener, their home race in Australia. After retiring at mid-distance, the Honey Badger was in no mood to hang around Albert Park .
"Jenson, my friend, I'm sure you wanted to hear my voice before starting the race! Just wishing you the best of luck. We followed you here on TV you did amaze yesterday. Take care of my car!"
"Ok... I'm going to pee in your seat!"
"[laughs] No please!"
Hours before starting their rookie Indy 500, Fernando Alonso wishes Jenson Button good luck from across the Atlantic as their former teammate prepares for their stand-in appearance in Monaco. They probably had even less desire to return to the McLaren cockpit after the 2009 world champion's joke.
"How can this take so long? If this is a solid blue they should just f---ing move out of the way!"
It wouldn't be a list of radio grievances without Kimi Raikkonen ranting about lapped traffic and blue flags. This one was from Austria but, let's face it, it could have been from any of the races for the last six years since theirs return....
"Hey what the f--- is this Williams guy doing? If they cannot see they should stay on the reporting stuff."
Paul di Resta's one-off return in place of the unwell Felipe Massa in Hungary (where they had originally been as a Sky Sports pundit) seemed to be popular with everyone -- everyone, that is, except from Raikkonen.
Sky Sports
"Yee-haaa! Yeah guys! Yeeeeaahhhhhhhhh!!! RAGGGGGHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!"
Ricciardo celebrates holding off the charging Lewis Hamilton for the final place on the podium in Austria as only Ricciardo could...
"Massa is next, they are alone now."
"I like 'em vulnerable."
...and then delivers one of their most memorable messages of the season when closing in on Felipe Massa in Italy.
"He wants to play bumper cars or something!"
Max Verstappen questions Sebastian Vettel's attempt to pass during a tussle for position at the British Grand Prix.
And the winner is...
Kimi Raikkonen will give us at least one more year of radio gold after gaining a 2018 contract extension with Ferrari. Sutton Images
There is only one man who deserves the award for radio rant of 2017. When you think of amusing radio messages in F1, one man comes to mind: The Iceman, Kimi Raikkonen. They delivered on that this year on more than one occasion (see above).
But they saved one of their all-time best for during the red-flag stoppage during the dramatic Azerbaijan as Ferrari wheeled them down the pit lane -- minus their steering wheel and race gloves, that is, which were being carried by an engineer next to their car. Cue the most frantic message you're ever likely to hear from the usually-monosyllabic Finn.
"Steering wheel! Gloves and steering wheel yeah. Hey! HEY!! Steering wheel, somebody tells them to give it to me! COME ON! MOVE!"
Never change, Kimi.

The public is not being told the truth about what really went down in Las Vegas. As you will see below, the evidence is mounting that there were multiple shooters and that this was an operation that was planned well in advance. But according to the mainstream media, a 64-year-old retired accountant with a flabby physique that had no military training whatsoever and that wasn't very experienced with guns was able to pull the whole thing off all by himself. We are being told that Paddock was a “lone wolf” that didn't have any ties to terror groups, and since they are now dead nobody is ever going to be able to interrogate him. But the American people definitely deserve some answers about what took place, and that means that all of us should keep digging.
The following are 16 unanswered questions about the Las Vegas shooting that the mainstream media does not want to talk about…
#1 Photos of Stephen Paddock's hotel room have been leaked, and one of those photos appears to show a suicide note. Why hasn't the public been told what is in that note?
#2 Were there additional shooters? A taxi driver clearly captured video of an automatic weapon being fired out of a lower level window. A video from another angle and brief footage captured by Dan Bilzerian also seem to confirm that automatic gunfire was coming from a floor much lower than the 32nd floor room that Stephen Paddock was located on. And if you weren't convinced by the first three videos, this fourth video should definitely do it.
#3 Why were law enforcement authorities discussing “another suspect on the fourth floor”, and why isn't the mainstream media talking about this?
#4 As Jon Rappoport has pointed out, it would have been impossible for Stephen Paddock to kill and wound 573 people in less than five minutes of shooting with the kinds of weapons that they are alleged to have used. So why won't law enforcement authorities acknowledge this fact?
#5 How in the world did Paddock get 42 guns and “several thousand rounds of ammo” into their hotel room without anyone noticing?
#6 How did someone with “no military background” and that wasn't a “gun guy at all” operate such advanced weapons? Because what we are being told by the mainstream media just doesn't make any sense whatsoever. I really like how Natural News made this point…
Far from what the firearms-illiterate media claims, these are not systems that any Joe off the street can just pick up and use to effortlessly mow down 500 people. Running these systems requires extensive training, experience and stamina. It is physically impossible for a guy like Stephen Paddock to operate such a system in the sustained, effective manner that we witnessed, especially when shooting from an elevated position which throws off all the ranging of the weapon system. Far from being a Navy Seal, Stephen Paddock is a retired accountant senior citizen with a gambling problem and a flabby physique. The only way they could have carried out this shooting is if they were transformed into a human superweapon through a magic wand. I'm calling this “Mission IMPOSSIBLE” because of the physical impossibility of a retired, untrained senior citizen pulling this off.
#7 Why was one woman telling people in the crowd that they were all going to die 45 minutes before the attack?
#8 Why did it take law enforcement authorities 72 minutes to get into Stephen Paddock's hotel room?
#9 Why did Paddock wire $100,000 to the Philippines last week?
#10 Why was Paddock's girlfriend, Marilou Danley, in the Philippines when the attack took place? Did they know what was about to happen?
#11 Was Paddock on antidepressants like so many other mass killers in the past have been?
#12 Why was ISIS so eager to take responsibility for this attack, and why was the FBI so quick to dismiss that connection?
#13 Apparently Paddock had earned millions of dollars “through real estate deals”. If they were so wealthy, why would they all of a sudden snap like that?
#14 Why did they move so frequently? It is being reported that Paddock had 27 different residences during their adult life.
#15 Why were nearly all of the exits out of the concert venue completely blocked?…
In essence, the concert trapped the people, preventing them from escaping, and denying them the ability to seek cover. From there, sustained, full-auto gunfire is almost impossible to survive. From Fox News, a caller named Russell Bleck, who survived the shooting, said live on air, “There were ten-foot walls blocking us in. We couldn't escape. It was just a massacre. We had nowhere to go.”
#16 Why was a country music festival chosen as the target? Was the goal to kill as many Trump supporters and other conservatives as possible? And is there evidence that Stephen Paddock was connected to Antifa in any way?
At first I thought that this was a fairly straightforward story too, but the more I have dug into it the more complex things have become.
Personally, I have come to the conclusion that Stephen Paddock definitely did not act alone. That means that the others involved in the shooting are still out there, and they must be brought to justice. Let us never forget what these extremely wicked individuals did to innocent civilians such as 27-year-old Tina Frost…
A 27-year-old woman has lost their right eye after a bullet ripped through their face during the Las Vegas concert massacre. Tina Frost remains in a coma in hospital after undergoing surgery to remove the bullet that became lodged in their eye when a gunman opened fire on the crowd of country music fans on Sunday night. Frost, who is originally from Maryland but moved to California several years ago, is expected to remain in the coma for a week.
Whoever did this is going to pay greatly. Yes, I do believe that Stephen Paddock was involved. But they did not act alone, and the mainstream media is doing the public a great disservice by ignoring all of the evidence that this was not just a “lone wolf” operation.

Don't expect any great things from this Trojan team this year so long as Tee Martin remains the offensive coordinator and is setting the game plan and calling plays. It is an embarrassment to think that someone who was a starting quarterback for a championship team has such an inept and ineffective approach to not only the running game, but even more importantly to a creative and dynamic passing game. They manage the game as if they are not there and is not watching what is actually happening on the field.
USC's defeat to Washington State was not to a better team ... it was to a better-coached team.

There is no rule against sending in a linebacker or safety when the opposing quarterback is picking you apart.
Really, you are allowed to blitz in the second half of an important game. Winning teams do lots of it.

If anyone needs an example of a contest where two opposing sides played not to lose, Washington State 30, USC 27 is it. The Cougars just happened to be better at it than the mighty Trojans. When your defense plays like your offense and your offense plays like your defense, bad things can happen.
It's getting to the point where USC looks like UCLA. Time to retool this band of underachievers.

And the Bruins
In an article on Sept. 30, Jim Mora stated, “Great competitors and really good teams, they respond in these situations.” They were referring to the Bruins' two-game losing streak. One could also state that great competitors and really good teams are NOT ranked 102 in rushing offense, 119 in time of possession, tied for 113 in turnover margin, 113 in punt returns, and 123 in penalty yards per game.
Wonder what would happen if you asked them (or their father) about getting to the playoffs.
Gary Yates

Analyze this
So reader Jerry Hiller thinks Troy Aikman was a bad choice to analyze the pro prospects of Josh Rosen and Sam Darnold, because their Bruin teams lost twice to USC. Never mind their three Super bowl rings and 15-year career as the top TV analyst, who meets with, dissects and breaks down NFL quarterback play every week.
Darnold proved last week that with a weak offensive line, they can be just as average as the UCLA walk-on forced to play behind a decimated offensive line last year. They have much less zip on their ball than Rosen, despite a nice scrambling ability that's wonderful for college quarterbacks.
At the same time, how much longer do we have to listen to homerKeyshawn Johnson on ESPN radio every day, as if knows it all about college football? Despite stabbing the fake sword into the Coliseum turf for their last game vs. UCLA, they were also 0-2 vs. the Bruins.

Here's a synopsis of the Dodgers' playoff schedule and the season.
Division series: Win- Expected; Lose-Totally surprising, Season-Major Disappointment;
Championship series: Win-Hoped for; Lose- Unforeseen, Season- Disappointment;
World Series: Win-Fabulous; Lose- Underwhelming and “Wait till next year”.

Almost half of my life has passed since the Dodgers last won the World Series in 1988. Few of the current Dodgers were a alive way back then. Traveling to away games during that span the Dodgers have flown more than twice as far as Aldrin, Collins and Armstrong did on Apollo 11. The Soviet Union was still a country. It was 10 years before Staples Center was built. It has been long enough, eh?

As a lifelong Giants fan, I never thought I would be saying this. The thrill of winning the World Series is so unbelievable, so emotional, especially doing it three times in six years, I hope that all Dodgers fans get to share that experience.

The non-playoffs
It's always amazing to me when I see former Angels playing for other teams; they often seem so much more confident, relaxed and successful. When they played for the Angels they seemed rather tentative and unsure. Jeff Mathis and Ervin Santana are the most recent examples. Mike Napoli was another glaring example. It looks like it is not fun to play for the scowling Mike Scioscia; consider how Joe Madden builds confidence in their players and makes the game fun.

Mike Scioscia is a nice guy, but selecting them as the best manager in California is a bad joke. Shouldn't one at least pretend to look at overall records? If Arte Moreno weren't so tight with a buck, Scioscia would have been gone years ago.

Sam Farmer details the downward spiral the L.A. Chargers franchise is in, but can anyone be surprised? Owner Dean Spanos failed in getting a new stadium approved in fan-friendly San Diego, then made every marketing mistake possible in their relocation to L.A. Remember their first preposterous plan, to partner with the Raiders on a stadium project to be built on a toxic landfill dump? The StubHub Center experiment has proved that the Chargers cannot even sell 27,000 seats for home games.
Kirstenbosch Garden, Cape Town
Known as one of Africa's most beautiful gardens, the Kirstenbosch Garden, which has the Table Mountains overlooking it, is an ideal spot to declare your wish to spend the rest of your life with your loved one. The garden was established in 1913 to promote, conserve and display the extraordinarily rich and diverse flora of southern Africa and was the first botanical gardens in the world to be devoted to a country's indigenous flora. It has a variety of plant life, including fynbos and cycads. It lies in the heart of the Cape Floristic Region, also known as the Cape Floral Kingdom, which was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2004.
Kirstenbosch is open to visitors every day from 08h00 to 19h00 in summer and from 08h00 to 18h00 in winter.
Last Sunday, January 28th, Ruins Rock Worlds Heritage Café, one of Dominica's hottest tourist spots, welcomed hundreds of tourists to its unique, cozy confines. These tourists were all passengers of the MV Mein Schiff 3 of TUI Cruises which became the first major cruise ship to visit Dominica after the passage of Hurricane Maria.
The proprietor Serge L'Homme, a heritage advocate who is fluent in 7 languages, gave a speech in German. They expressed their gratitude to the visitors and told them that despite the destruction and difficulties caused by the last hurricane, Dominicans remained strong and resilient. They told them that the hurricane was not able to break the nation's spirit and the rebuilding effort is well underway.
The visiting cruise passengers received those statements with rousing applause and enthusiastic cheers.
Ruins Rock Café even unveiled a program for these tourists that its management and staff have prepared especially for that day. Dubbed “Give Thanks Sunday”, the program included rum punches and other cocktails prepared especially for that day; local food, exotic rums, DJ music and a live band that provided the much-appreciated entertainment and got the crowd dancing, jumping, and cheering loudly.
“Indeed, we rolled out the ‘green carpet' of the Nature Isle for them.” L'Homme said.
L'Homme also expressed appreciation to the cooperation shown by the various local tourism stakeholders and the support shown by various Government units like the Ministry of Tourism & Urban Renewal and the Discover Dominica Authority and other key tourism non-governmental organizations like the Dominica Hotel & Tourism Association (DHTA).
Tourists were also quick to note that aside from the unique, cozy ambience of the place, they also appreciated the local rum punches and warm customer service provided to them not just by the service crew but by L'Homme himself.
“We had a number of new staff who served that day with some help from some old reliables. But I believe we did quite well. We are investing in a good training program for our staff precisely for that purpose: to provide our customers the best possible service and to be able to represent our country the best way we know so all our guests would end up having good words about our nation.” L”homme explained.

The film is based on the life of Dante ‘Tex' Gill (Johansson), a notorious figure in the Pittsburgh underworld in the late 70s and early 80s, who masqueraded as a man in order to run a massage parlour and prostitution business.
They also ran an anabolic steroids ring for NFL team the Pittsburgh Steelers and used their connections in the gay community to deceive the mob until they were eventually convicted of tax evasion in 1984 and spent seven years in prison.
The film will also include Tex's turbulent relationship with their girlfriend Cynthia, comingsoon.net reports
The movie will see Johansson reunite with director Rupert Sanders - whom they worked with in ‘Ghost in the Shell' - as they lead from a script by Gary Spinelli.
Johansson, Spinelli, Joel Silver, Tobey Maguire, Matthew Plouffe and Jonathan Lia will produce, while Joel Silver's Silver Pictures, Tobey Maguire's Material Pictures and Johansson's These Pictures will co-produce.

The rest of the casting is yet to be announced.
Lansing Man Drowns At Spring Mill Pond Sunday
August 14, 2017
A drowning at the Island Lake State Recreation Area sparked a large scale recovery effort involving multiple departments this past weekend.
The Green Oak Township Police and fire departments were called out around 7:19pm Sunday to the Spring Mill Pond for a reported drowning. Authorities say an 18-year-old Lansing man had been floating on a personal inflatable raft in the Spring Mill Pond when they fell and became submerged below the surface. The man was said to be outside of the marked swim area and was relying solely on the inflatable raft to stay afloat. Police say the victim did not know how to swim and the drowning had been witnessed by other family members that had gathered at the park for a party.
A coordinated effort to locate the victim was started once emergency responders arrived on scene. After conducting an underwater search, the victim was located by members of the Livingston County Dive Team in water that was approximately 24 feet deep, roughly 35 yards from the shoreline. The victim was submerged beneath the surface for approximately one hour and 45 minutes before being removed from the water and pronounced deceased. Their identity is not being released, pending notification of all family members.
The Hartland and Howell Fire Departments, U of M Survival Flight and Livingston County EMS assisted at the scene. (JM)

Volunteers have helped keep a tearoom running in a North Lincolnshire village after the owner was diagnosed with breast cancer.
At the end of July, Lisa Younes opened Harrison's Past & Present in Barrow's Market Place with their partner Andy Harrison. It is a a coffee shop/antiques and collectables centre.
This is something they had dreamed of for years but in October, they received the devastating news that they had breast cancer.
Lisa had to go into hospital for an operation so was faced with closing the cafe as they only has one member of staff who wouldn't be able to run it without help.
However, an appeal went out on the Better Barrow Community Project website for helpers and within a short time, enough people had come forward for a rota to be organised so that there were sufficient people to keep it running.
The operation was successful and Lisa is now able to be in the cafe and the help will continue to be available as long as they need it.
Lisa said they have always wanted to open a cafe ever since they met Andy at a tearoom in Whitby in 2011.
Sadly, their parents both died of cancer. Lisa said they started getting pains a few months ago and shortly after, found a lump.
They went to the doctors who sent them to the hospital. Lisa was diagnosed with breast cancer in October.
In late October, they underwent a successful operation to have it cut out and they will shortly be starting radiotherapy.
Lisa said it has had a big impact on their life.
"Once the word cancer is mentioned, it changes your outlook on life. It has made me appreciate how lucky I am and it has made me see how amazing everybody is round here," they said.
Lisa said had it not been for the volunteers, they would have had to close the cafe.
"It is like a little Christmas fairytale. Everyone is working together," they said.
Lisa wanted to thank everyone that has helped out.
Ann Boulton, a committee member on the Better Barrow Community Project, said a number of volunteers got in touch when the appeal went out.
Lisa said the company their partner works for has been very supportive throughout.  They are also donating proceeds from cakes to Grimsby's Pink Rose Suite.

A charity has amassed £30,000 for a Hartlepool cause thanks to years of devoted fundraising.
The Pansies Breast Cancer Support group has long supported the work of Alice House Hospice.
We know first-hand of the care and support that is given to local women coping with breast cancer, especially through the Day Hospice. We are proud to make this donation and achieve more than £30,000 Isobel Wilson
It has fundraised for the cause for the past 16 years and has recently reached the fundraising milestone.
Pansies is a group of like-minded ladies who meet once a week. Their fundraising has supported many aspects of hospice care such as the lymphoedema service, complementary therapies; as well as providing funds to buy vital equipment such as portable oxygen machines and nebulisers.
Hospice senior fundraising manager Rebecca Jobson praised the amazing backing and said: “The Pansies have supported the hospice for a long time now and they have continued to raise an amazing amount of money each year. It is always heart-warming to work with the people and groups from within our local communities. Thank You.
“The ladies of Pansies Breast Cancer Support group visited the Holistic Wellbeing Centre to present the cheque and have a cuppa and mince pies with staff from the hospice.”
Isobel Wilson, from Pansies, said: “We know first-hand of the care and support that is given to local women coping with breast cancer, especially through the Day Hospice. We are proud to make this donation and achieve more than £30,000.”
Alice House Hospice, based in Wells Avenue, Hartlepool, is a registered charity offering specialist palliative care to hundreds of adults from Hartlepool and East Durham each year.
Individuals who access hospice services can be living with illnesses such as Cancer, Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disorder, Motor Neurone Disease, end stage heart disease and Parkinson's.
Each patient and their family or carers receives tailor-made services to meet their physical, emotional, spiritual and psychological and cultural needs in comfort and dignity.
It costs £2.3 million to continue providing the current range of services. The Hospice receives 24% NHS funding so the outstanding £1.7 million must be raised through the local community and other fundraising initiatives.
Manhattan DA said Weinstein was brought ‘another step closer to accountability' by the indictment.
Harvey Weinstein has been indicted on rape and criminal sex act charges.
The film producer was brought “another step closer to accountability” by the indictment, Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr said as they made the announcement.
It comes hours after a statement issued through a spokesperson said Weinstein would not testify before the grand jury over sex charges on the advice of their lawyers.
The film producer was charged last Friday on two counts of rape and one of a criminal sexual act for alleged incidents involving two separate women.
Weinstein was due to face the grand jury – the panel convened by the Manhattan District Attorney.
They say the former movie mogul did not have enough time to prepare to testify, and that they only learned on Friday of the identities of the two women relating to the charges.
A statement from the Manhattan DA announcing the grand jury indictment said: ““A grand jury has voted to indict Harvey Weinstein on charges of rape in the first and third Degrees, and Criminal Sexual Act in the first degree.
“This indictment brings the defendant another step closer to accountability for the crimes of violence with which they are now charged.
“Our office will try this case not in the press, but in the courtroom where it belongs. The defendant's recent assault on the integrity of the survivors and the legal process is predictable. We are confident that when the jury hears the evidence, it will reject these attacks out of hand.”
Harvey Weinstein was arraigned on rape and other charges (Bebeto Matthews/AP) More
A statement issued on behalf of Weinstein's lawyer Benjamin Brafman said: “After being unfairly denied access to critical information about this case that was needed to defend them before the grand jury, Mr Weinstein's attorneys decided there was not sufficient time to properly prepare Mr Weinstein.
“The identities of the accusers and the specific charges were provided to Mr Weinstein last Friday on the eve of the Memorial Day weekend and a deadline for their appearance set for Wednesday, 2pm.
“Our request for a postponement of their appearance before the grand jury was denied.
“Accordingly, Mr Brafman will inform the District Attorney today that Mr Weinstein intends to follow the advice of their attorneys and not testify before the grand jury.”
The statement continued: “Not having access to these materials is particularly troubling in this case, where one of the unsupported allegations is more than 14 years old and the rape allegation involves a woman with whom Mr Weinstein shared a 10-year consensual sexual relationship that continued for years after the alleged incident in 2013.
“Finally, Mr Weinstein's attorneys noted that regardless of how compelling Mr Weinstein's personal testimony might be, an indictment was inevitable due to the unfair political pressure being placed on Cy Vance to secure a conviction of Mr Weinstein.”
Weinstein, 66, was in court on Friday in New York in their first public appearance since facing numerous allegations of sexual misconduct.
They posted a one million dollar (£751,060) cash bail and agreed to wear an electronic monitor which tracks their movements 24 hours a day, seven days a week.
They also surrendered their passport and agreed to stay within the states of New York and Connecticut.
Weinstein, who has repeatedly denied allegations of non-consensual sex, intends to plead not guilty to the charges, Mr Brafman said outside court.

But people protesting in Des Moines on Tuesday want more action from the bank, starting with the resignation of Chief Executive Timothy Sloan, a longtime Wells Fargo executive who was promoted to the corner office in 2016. They succeeded John Stumpf, the CEO who resigned in the weeks after the initial scandal over unauthorized accounts.
South Korea's pilot project for a coinless society has gained momentum as it enhances convenience for ordinary people, the central bank said Thursday.
Under the project that began in mid-April, consumers can deposit small change left from purchases of goods into their prepaid or mobile cards at convenience stores, discount stores and department stores, according to the Bank of Korea.
(Yonhap)
It means that consumers won't have to carry coins in their pockets after making cash payments.The number of deposits came to 36,617 in the first 10 days of June on average, up from 32,862 between April 20 and 30. The value of deposits also came to 6.56 million won ($5,840), up from 6.43 million won in late April, according to the BOK.The project could lower the cost of producing coins, though the BOK said the outcome of the experiment remains to be seen. Last year, South Korea spent 53.7 billion won producing coins.Participants in the pilot project include CU, a major South Korean convenience store chain; 7-Eleven; E-Mart, the country's largest discount store outlet by sales; Lotte Mart; and Lotte Department Store.

AN audacious bid by the Dadaya High's school development committee (SDC) to force Primary and Secondary Education minister Lazarus Dokora to stall the implementation of the new education curriculum has suffered a stillbirth after the Bulawayo High Court ruled it was not urgent.
Source: Dadaya case against Dokora stalls – NewsDay Zimbabwe February 14, 2017

Dadaya filed an urgent chamber application at the Bulawayo High Court on February 9 challenging the minister over the introduction of the new education curriculum, which the school argued was “disruptive”. The SDC cited the school's principal and Dokora as respondents.
“There is no basis upon which this matter can be allowed to jump the queue. I refuse to deal with it on an urgent basis. The matter will proceed by ordinary application,” Justice Nicholas Mathonsi ruled.
In its application the SDC submitted that on February 4, 2017 a parents' meeting was held at Dadaya High School, where the principal said a curriculum change was to be implemented, as per the minister's directive through a Circular Number 2 of 2017.
“When the first respondent [school head] was asked why the parents or applicants were not consulted about such a significant change in the education system, they highlighted that consultations were carried out with villagers, who were randomly picked in the surroundings of the school and it must be noted that Dadaya High is a boarding school and the majority of parents do not reside within the surrounding areas,” the application read.
The disgruntled parents then authorised the SDC to file an urgent application against Dokora, arguing the school did not have the requisite infrastructure, skills and facilities to implement the changes.
The SDC said the Constitution provides for the consultation of interested parties in law making processes and failure to consult the parents violates section 68 of the Constitution.
SDC chairperson, Leopold Mudisi, in their founding affidavit, submitted that they were seeking an interdict against Dokora and the school head from effecting the new curriculum, which they said has been imposed on their children.
Mudisi said the changes have profound, deep-rooted and catastrophic implications to the education needs of its children.

Bob Dylan has been accused of stealing a number of sentences about the novel "Moby-Dick" from an online study guide and dropping them into their recent Nobel Prize lecture.
Inspired by commentary by writer Ben Greenman, who noted that Dylan appeared to have invented a quote from the sizable book, Slate's Andrea Pitzer analyzed the portion of the lecture pertaining to Herman Melville's book and found that "more than a dozen" of Dylan's 78 sentences about it "appear to closely resemble lines from the SparkNotes site."
"[M]ost of the key shared phrases in these passages (such as 'Ahab's lust for vengeance' ... ) do not appear in the novel 'Moby-Dick' at all," Pitzer said Tuesday.
In their lecture, Dylan also named "All Quiet on the Western Front" and "The Odyssey" as books that had stuck with them since childhood.
Greenman, in noticing the apparently invented "Moby-Dick" quote (“Some men who receive injuries are led to God, others are led to bitterness") seemed to chalk it up to Dylan being Dylan and had no problem with it.
"It appears, from all available evidence, that Dylan invented the quote and inserted it into their reading of 'Moby-Dick,' " they wrote. "Was it on purpose? Was it the result of a faulty memory? Was it an egg, left in the lawn to be discovered in case it's Eastertime too? Answering these questions would be drilling into the American Sphinx, and beside the point anyway. As it stands, it's very much in the spirit of their entire enterprise: to take various American masterworks and absorb and transform them. The mystery of it makes a wonderful lecture even more wonderful."
Dylan, who won the Nobel in Literature prize last year, didn't travel to Stockholm to accept the honor and its nearly $1-million prize on Dec. 10 but instead recorded the customary lecture in Los Angeles on June 4 and uploaded it to YouTube on June 5, just beating a six-month deadline to deliver it. The Nobel Foundation posted a transcript as well.
"Triplicate," the 76-year-old's newest release — a three-album set covering songs from the Great American Songbook, which followed two other albums of songs written by other people —came out at the end of March.
In their review, The Times' Randy Lewis noted:
"[Th]e vast majority of the songs Dylan included on 2015's 'Shadows in the Night,' last year's 'Fallen Angels' and now this follow-up were popularized by Frank Sinatra.
"It's therefore probably no coincidence that in form, content and title, 'Triplicate' echoes Sinatra's latter-years magnum opus, 'Trilogy,' a three-album 1980 release organized with a different theme for each disc: 'The Past,' 'The Present' and 'The Future.'
"In Dylan's case, the separate discs are individually themed ' 'Til the Sun Goes Down,' 'Devil Dolls' and 'Comin' Home Late.' "
In their Nobel lecture, Dylan summarized their takeaway from "Moby-Dick" thusly:
"Ishmael survives," they wrote. "He's in the sea floating on a coffin. And that's about it. That's the whole story. That theme and all that it implies would work its way into more than a few of my songs."
KHANEWAL-No doubt that the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) is a game-changer and will bring economic revolution, peace and massive employment opportunities to Pakistan.
PML-N MNA Saeed Ahmed Manais stated while talking to a delegation of senior journalists here the other day.
They said that the Chinese investment in the country reflects successful economic policies of the incumbent government led by Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, adding Pakistan's economy will continue flourishing under the dynamic leadership of the PM. They said that the political elements busy with hooliganism in the parliament actually are fighting for their political survival. They said that the people now have grown mature and have rejected negative politics of such elements.
They said that the PML-N has introduced competent candidates in local bodies who are eligible to address the public problems. Mr Manais said that the government is committed to improve infrastructure, energy and health facilities in the district. They also appreciated the positive role of media in highlighting the civic problems.

Gunmen in Afghanistan kidnapped 52 farmers on Wednesday, most of them members of the minority Uzbek community in the remote northern province of Jowzjan, regional officials said, but the motive for the abductions was not immediately clear.
Afghanistan's once-stable north has become a hotbed of kidnappings and shootings in recent years, as the militant Taliban gains ground, along with small groups loyal to Islamic State, mostly defectors from the Afghan and Pakistani Taliban.
The men seized in Wednesday's incident were kidnapped from three villages in the district of Darz Ab in Jowzjan, while they were at work on their land.
Provincial police blamed Taliban fighters that control most of the district.
"The Taliban is responsible for this act, as they are leading those areas," said Mohammad Riza Ghori, a spokesperson for the police chief of Jowzjan.
"A number of elders from Darz Ab, including the police chief, are trying to talk to the Taliban to release these people, and if this does not work, we will launch an operation."
They did not give further details of plans for such a rescue operation, however.
A Taliban spokesperson, Zabihullah Mujahid, said they were aware of the report, but could not confirm it as they were gathering information.
Jowzjan is the same province where gunmen last week killed six employees of the International Committee of the Red Cross as they helped deliver emergency relief after heavy snow storms.
Two workers were also kidnapped in that attack, which prompted the ICRC to suspend operations in Afghanistan.
Regional officials blamed last week's attack on Islamic State fighters and the Taliban denied involvement.
However, police spokesperson Ghori said there was no Islamic State presence in the area where the farmers were kidnapped, only Taliban.
CINCINNATI -- Rookie wide receiver John Ross was a full participant in practice Monday for the first time since the Bengals took them with the ninth overall pick in the 2017 draft.
Ross, who holds the NFL combine record for the fastest 40-yard dash time, hadn't been able to participate in any contact drills all offseason and was limited to individual noncontact drills.
They have been recovering from offseason labrum surgery for an injured shoulder and did not play in Cincinnati's first preseason game. It seems unlikely Ross will play in Saturday's preseason game against the Chiefs as well
"That's a question for the trainers," they said. "I just want to take everything slowly, I don't want to rush everything. I don't think it's imperative for me to come back right now and play Saturday. I think it's important for me to be ready for Week 1."
Ross said they have been waiting for weeks to get the all-go from the medical staff.
"It's definitely frustrating," Ross said of the waiting. "You get drafted to play football, so to have to be able to watch with all the expectations coming in as a first-round draft pick, you want to come in and play at your best ability. You don't want to have to prove anything to anyone. You want to make sure you're here for what you are drafted for, and I haven't had a chance to, but today was a great start."
Ross spent most of 11-on-11 drills working with the first-team unit and was thrown one deep ball by AJ McCarron, an incomplete pass covered by cornerback William Jackson III that Ross admitted they probably dropped.
"I was a little too excited," Ross said. "I maybe had some mental errors because I was so excited just to be around the guys and maybe showcase to everybody how fast I actually am."
They added: "I think our coaches -- they brought me in for a reason. They know what I'm capable of, I know what I'm capable of, I've just got to trust the plan and trust everything that they're saying and continue to get better every day. That fastest man thing, it really doesn't mean anything. It's football now. It's not 'set, go' from Andy and I'm running 40 yards and I get there first. I have to compete. So from now on it's competing to be the best at my position and being better than I was yesterday."
Artyom Minulin scored 2:53 into overtime as the Swift Current Broncos stifled Saskatoon's comeback for a 5-4 victory over the Blades on Sunday in Western Hockey League action.
Glenn Gawdin had a hat trick for Swift Current (21-11-7) and Conner Chaulk also scored.

Braylon Shmyr scored twice and added an assist for the Blades (14-20-6), who rallied from a 4-2 deficit to tie the game in the third period. Caleb Fantillo and Jesse Shynkaruk, with the tying goal 15:43 into the third, also scored.
Broncos goaltender Travis Child made 38 saves. Saskatoon's Logan Flodell stopped 26 shots in the losing effort.
The Blades play the Wheat Kings next in Brandon, Man., on Tuesday.

In Washington, a city that has gone nine years short of a century without postseason success, this will be a play that will live in infamy.
It was a ground ball, hit hard but not impossibly so, hit directly at the man that committed the fewest errors of any everyday third baseman in the major leagues. Anthony Rendon fielded the ball, lifted their glove to transfer the ball to their hand and ... dropped the ball.
“It's like when you have a car accident,” Rendon said. “It's not a car purpose. It's a mistake. We're human.”
The mistake did not seem immediately ominous. Stephen Strasburg, the pitcher for the Washington Nationals, was throwing a no-hitter. This was the sixth inning. Of the first 15 outs, eight had come by strikeout. They had thrown their fastball as hard as 99 mph.
So what if Rendon had just made their first error in three months? Strasburg retired the next two batters, one on a sacrifice bunt. They should have been out of the inning.
They got strike one, then strike two on Kris Bryant, the defending National League most valuable player. In their previous at-bat, Strasburg struck them out on a change. They went fastball here, a fastball intended to wander high and outside. The pitch did not escape the strike zone, and Bryant poked it into right field, an 0-2 mistake that ended Strasburg's no-hitter and shutout all at once.
“I didn't even know they had a no-no, to tell you the truth,” Washington's Bryce Harper said. “Sorry about that. It's pretty cool that they had one.”
The Nationals, the team that never has advanced past the division series, instantly went from being 10 outs from celebrating a no-hitter to losing yet again. A raucous crowd went silent, sensing October doom yet again.
Bryant had taken second base on the throw home, Anthony Rizzo, like Bryant, had struck out in each of their first two at-bats against Strasburg. And, like Bryant, they singled in their third at-bat, and the Chicago Cubs had a 2-0 lead.
The Nationals never did score. The defending World Series champion Cubs beat the Nationals, 3-0, in Friday's opener of the best-of-five division series. The home- field advantage shifted to the Cubs, with Jon Lester lined up to start for Chicago here Saturday, but Harper said the untimely inning did not trigger images of another postseason defeat in the Nationals' heads.
“That's why we play five,” they said.
Kyle Hendricks might not have been the headliner of the evening, but they were the star. Hendricks throws their fastball in the high 80s. Strasburg was throwing their changeup harder.
No matter. Hendricks, the unheralded right-hander from Orange County, pitched seven shutout innings, giving up two hits: a single to Harper in the first inning, and a single to Michael A. Taylor in the second inning. The Nationals did not get a runner into scoring position — or a hit, for that matter — after the second inning.
Hendricks works in the shadow of Lester, who starred for the Cubs and Boston Red Sox in October, and Arrieta, the 2015 NL Cy Young award winner.
It was Hendricks who started Game 7 of last year's World Series. And it is Hendricks who has a 1.98 postseason earned-run average — better than Lester, better than Arrieta, better than the only man to beat them in October: Clayton Kershaw.
Hendricks thrives on postseason adrenaline, even if they seldom shows it.
“I'm a laid-back guy,” they said, “but you're definitely feeling it.”
Strasburg pitched seven innings, walking one and striking out 10. Never had a Nationals pitcher struck out so many in a postseason game. They did not give up an earned run.
But they and the Nationals lost. They must win three of their next four games, or their autumn will be cold and bitter yet again. Rendon insisted their October failures did not creep into their heads as a no-hitter tilted into defeat.
“That's 2016, 2015, 2014,” they said, apparently forgetting the Nationals had lost in 2016, 2014 and 2012. “What year is it this year?”
2017.
“There you go,” they said, and off they went into the night.

Analogy is well used in startups and most boardrooms around the world to simplify and find parallels between two different things, but the method is often overlooked for more complex tasks surrounding innovation.
Analogous thinking is the process of looking for help with known issues by referring to and connecting with unfamiliar but potentially applicable areas and transferring and adapting learning from one to the other.
The practice is fast invading businesses around the globe for two reasons: it works, and disruption is happening at an unprecedented rate.
Per Yale's Richard Foster, 75 percent of the S&P 500 will be replaced in the next decade—a worrying statistic for any CEO. While some prefer to keep this sort of thinking firmly in the startup toolkit, I believe it can help companies stave off competition and disruption.
While researching my book Disruptive Technologies: Understand, Evaluate, and Respond, I looked at the role analogy has played in businesses like Apple, Intel, Dunkin' Donuts, and even law firms and supermarkets.
It turned out to be more common than you would think.
Analogies enable leaders, scientists, and strategists to look at the picture more widely, quickly grasp its complexities, and evaluate decisions from a new perspective, which is critical in these fast-moving and volatile times.
Why Is Analogy So Powerful?
Analogy helps people digest new ideas quickly because the simpler thing enables the more complex thing to be more easily understood and built upon.
Analogous thinking goes one step further and uses seemingly disparate experts or sources to elevate thinking on an issue or problem.
Here's an example: Imagine there is a food restaurant that needs to serve more customers in less time but still offer a wide variety.
Now, imagine asking an executive who recently flew to Taiwan for a solution. With the baggage conveyor belt fresh in mind, they might come up with something like the Yo! Sushi restaurant conveyer belt.
To think more analogously, increase your inputs and experiences. The more experiences you have, the more connections you can make. Walk a new way home, read different media, go to a talk that has nothing to do with your job or passions, sketch things, create mindmaps, ask all the wrong people you can.
Difference is king. If you make planes don't ask a car mechanic, a chef is a better choice that will produce really different ideas.
How to Run Your Own Analogous Thinking Exercise
To build analogous thinking into your decision-making, a process is needed. Here are six steps to get you started, and you can modify as you see fit.
1. Identify the right stimulus. While some will do this exercise in the office, most people fare better in a neutral or unfamiliar setting. Some of the best sessions have been run in places like playgrounds, kitchens, and churches. If you must complete the task in your office, infuse it with stimuli like print-out collages, Play-Doh, post-its, and whiteboards. Try to avoid business as usual.
2. Identify the issue to be solved. Making sure the problem you want to solve is concretely described or articulated is paramount to maximizing potential for success. Poor analogies are formed when the issue isn't clearly defined. For some companies, this may mean taking an hour or more to refine it down into a simpler form before moving forward.
3. Identify outside arenas to explore. These are the areas you're going to explore for analogous connections. Free association can work, but usually a more guided stream will see tighter results and save time. Focus people by limiting what you will explore in the first session (there can always be further sessions) either beforehand or with an initial ideation exercise.
4. Explore the new arenas for connections. This is the science or strategic part of the exercise. Suggest connections, then list out the attributes of success or failure. Start to examine what makes each successful or why it works. What's similar? What's different? What was key to its success? Make sure you fully understand the new connection before moving on.
5. Review the findings and form a proposition. Now that you have the connections broken down, look at the list and start to re-list and prioritize connections that seem to best fit your issue. Sometimes it helps to put these on separate cards and sort them as a group with discussion. The final part of the sort will be to analyze whether they map directly or indirectly to the issue you want to solve. What you have is unlikely to be perfect, but new similarities will be formed and new connections may be sparked.
6. Decision. Once you have your proposition, you need to decide whether to move forward with it. Will what you have created work for your company and the consumers it serves? If not, continue refining the response and working the analogy so that you have a workable solution.
A word of warning with step six. Know when to admit something is wrong or something has failed. Bad analogies are rife throughout the business world. Go beyond these and challenge yourself to not only stop using them but also challenge your own tendencies to seek out information that confirms your own beliefs (confirmation bias).
Analogy has a huge part to play in education and business as companies look to disrupt competitors and create new markets. Freud is famed for saying that analogies “decide nothing but they can make you feel more at home.” I disagree; analogies might just help save some of the businesses that will disappear from the S&P 500 in the not-too-distant future.
Steve Jobs was a huge proponent of analogy. As Apple has become one of the most valuable businesses of all time, more companies might take a leaf out of the Apple magic book and think more analogously. Your firm's future might just be saved or changed by the chef you spoke to at a dinner party.

(Reuters) - Patients with an advanced form of an aggressive blood cancer who had initially responded to Novartis' new type of gene-modifying immunotherapy continued to respond at least six months after treatment, according to updated data released at a medical meeting on Sunday.
Swiss drugmaker Novartis' logo is seen at the company's plant in the northern Swiss town of Stein, Switzerland October 23, 2017. REUTERS/Arnd Wiegmann
Among 46 patients with at least six months of follow-up after treatment with Novartis' Kymriah for diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), 30 percent still had a complete response, meaning no detectable sign of cancer, with another 7 percent achieving a partial response.
The results indicate that, in the 81-patient study, those with no sign of cancer after three months remained relapse-free at six months and beyond, researchers reported at the American Society of Hematology meeting in Atlanta.
“Patients that are in complete remission by 3 to 6 months are going to have durable remissions,” said Dr. Stephen Schuster, the trial's lead investigator, who has patients from an earlier pilot study alive more than three years after Kymriah treatment.
Kymriah belongs to a new class of therapy called CAR-T. It works by harvesting a patient's own disease-fighting T-cells, genetically engineering them to target specific proteins on cancer cells, and replacing them to circulate possibly for years, seeking out and attacking cancer.
“The technology is spectacular,” said Schuster, from the University of Pennsylvania's Abramson Cancer Center. “We're able to save the lives of people that just a few years ago we couldn‘t. I can't express the amount of satisfaction and excitement that I have.”
The one-time treatment with a list price of $475,000 was approved in August for patients up to 25 years of age with advanced acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), becoming the first CAR-T treatment to market. A second from Gilead Sciences was later approved.
Novartis has applied for U.S. and European approval for Kymriah to treat adults with DLBCL, a common, aggressive type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma.
Patients in the study had relapsed or failed to respond to multiple rounds of chemotherapy plus stem cell transplants for about half of them, exhausting virtually all available options. They were allowed to receive additional chemotherapy while awaiting return of their engineered cells, an average turnaround time of about three weeks.
The cells can also be frozen until a patient is deemed clinically ready to receive them.
At the latest interim analysis, median duration of response had not been reached, meaning more than half the patients who responded had not experienced disease return or progression.
There were no deaths attributed to cytokine release syndrome or neurological side effects, both potentially dangerous reactions to the treatment.
Novartis expects to have 35 centers capable of processing Kymriah fully operational by the end of the year.
“We are in an amazing time,” Schuster said, “and it's really just the beginning.”
NASHVILLE - Two years ago, country singer Scotty McCreery found out they lost their record deal with Mercury/Interscope while shooting an episode for "American Idol," the show they won in 2011. They had come back to mentor new contestants on the show, which was then on Fox, but their own career was at a precipice.
"I was trying to put on a happy face while I was filming," the 24-year-old singer with the baritone voice said. "That was a rough week."
McCreery, who is from North Carolina, had started their career on a high at 18 by becoming the youngest male artist and first country artist to debut their first album on the Billboard 200. Although their albums sold well, McCreery leaned toward the more traditional side of the genre, when bro-country and party songs ruled the airwaves.
They managed to get some Top 10 radio hits with "See You Tonight" and "Feelin' It," but they also dealt with the bias that many talent-show competitors run up against in the music industry.
"I think we've had to work hard to establish ourselves away from 'American Idol,' to not just be the TV guy, but to be the country music artist that writes songs and tells stories and can sing songs," said McCreery, who adds that he's always been proud of their "Idol" beginning. He's even returned to the new season of "Idol," now on ABC, as a mentor.
But McCreery feared that after losing their record deal, they were losing the rights to the songs they had recorded while they were still signed. In particular, they wanted to get back a song called "Five More Minutes," which they wrote after losing their grandfather in 2015.
McCreery spent a year negotiating the purchase of those songs, still out touring as an independent artist and even releasing a memoir.
"In Nashville, in particular, if you get dealt a fatal blow like what we got dealt in 2016, you don't often get a second chance," McCreery said. "So I knew if we were going to bet my career on anything, the resurgence of my career, I am going to bet on 'Five More Minutes.'"
McCreery's rebound play worked. They released "Five More Minutes" last year while still unsigned. The song became an emotional part of their live shows, earning standing ovations. They signed to independent Nashville label Thirty Tigers Records, which pushed it to the top of Billboard's country airplay chart this month, just in time for "Seasons Change," which came out on Friday.
It's hard to imagine staging a career comeback at 24, but McCreery considers their new record an introduction of sorts.
LOS ANGELES — Marvel's continuing space opera Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 has yet to hit theatres, but plans are already in the works for the third instalment.
On Monday, James Gunn announced on Facebook that they would be returning to write and direct Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3. Gunn also wrote and directed the first and second Guardians films.
The franchise stars Chris Pratt, Zoe Saldana, Dave Bautista and features the voices of Bradley Cooper and Vin Diesel.

NEW YORK, Feb 2 (Reuters) - The U.S. bond market's gauges of inflation expectations added to their earlier rise on Friday as domestic wages recorded their strongest annual increase in more than 8-1/2 years, suggesting inflation may be accelerating.
The 10-year inflation breakeven rate, or the yield gap between 10-year Treasury Inflation Protected Securities and regular 10-year Treasury notes, reached its highest level since September 2014 after the latest payrolls data. At 9:02 a.m. (1402 GMT), it was 2.13 percent, up more than 1 basis point from late on Thursday, Tradeweb and Reuters data showed. (Reporting by Richard Leong)

Gabriel Jesus has thanked fans for their support after suffering a broken metatarsal.
The 19-year-old hobbled out of Monday night's 2-0 win at Bournemouth after 14 minutes and will undergo surgery to ensure they do not suffer a recurrence of the injury.
City's medical staff gave forward Jesus the option of physiotherapy or an operation — the former meaning they would be back sooner, within four weeks, but with the risk of fresh damage to the affected area.
The decision was taken for them to undergo surgery to completely fix the broken bone in their right foot, even though it means they may only be back for the last month of the season.
The teenager posted a philosophical message on Instagram and thanked fans for their support after suffering the injury setback.

Jesus flew back to Manchester from the south coast with the rest of the City squad and underwent scans on Tuesday which confirmed the break that will keep them sidelined for a prolonged period.
The injury is a bitter blow to City boss Pep Guardiola, who had made Jesus their first-choice striker at the expense of Sergio Aguero, who started their last three games on the bench.
But the enforced loss of Jesus has reopened the door for Aguero, who had been facing a lengthy spell as a substitute, with Jesus gelling so successfully with fellow attackers Leroy Sané and Raheem Sterling.

Aguero will be restored as City's first-choice striker while Jesus is sidelined, but the 28-year-old is still facing an uncertain future, with a summer move increasingly likely after six years in Manchester.
Real Madrid and Paris Saint-Germain are monitoring Aguero's situation ahead of a potential summer bid, with Guardiola having already declared Jesus, Sane and Sterling as the "future" of City.
Jesus, a £27million signing from Palmeiras in their homeland, made a sensational start to their City career, scoring three goals in their first two Premier League games, as well as providing two assists.
The teenager kept Aguero on the bench for the third game running at Bournemouth but their night was short-lived with the injury that has sabotaged their debut season in England.
A City statement said: "Manchester City can confirm Gabriel Jesus suffered a fractured metatarsal during the 2-0 win over Bournemouth on Monday night.
"The 19-year-old was withdrawn from action after 15 minutes of the game and assessed by the Club's medical staff.
"He will undergo further examinations in the coming days to establish the extent of their layoff.
"We wish Gabriel a speedy recovery and we will keep you updated on their progress via the Club's official channels in the coming days."
Breakups are always emotional, more so when they're expensive. Let's calculate the financial carnage of Aetna's breakup with Humana, a $34-billion merger deal that was shut down by a federal judge three weeks ago and ended by the two big insurance companies on Tuesday.
We figure that Aetna wasted roughly $1.8 billion, pre-tax, in pursuit of a merger that many experts said was so anti-competitive that it probably wouldn't fly. This is a good portion of Aetna's $2.3 billion in reported profit last year, on revenue of $63.2 billion. Of course, the costs are generally tax-deductible, so the U.S. taxpayer effectively is footing at least part of the bill — perhaps one-third, based on standard corporate tax rates.
Given that Aetna is a company that whined piteously about much smaller losses on its Affordable Care Act business — so much so that it cut loose more than 700,000 individual insurance customers to save money — it's proper to ask what they were thinking.
We know what they say they were thinking: Aetna Chairman and Chief Executive Mark Bertolini mouthed the boilerplated platitudes in the announcement of the breakup. “We continue to believe that a combined company would create greater value for healthcare consumers through improved affordability and quality,” they said.
An expensive and risky bet on an uncertain outcome... with consequences that could limit competition and have a negative impact on consumer choice. — Sen. Elizabeth Warren, et al, on Aetna's $1-billion merger breakup fee
This is the usual unspecific pap employed to justify any big merger, especially in healthcare. If we've learned anything from experience, it's that such mergers end up raising prices and reducing efficiencies and innovation. In other words, the opposite of what Bertolini claimed. That's because lower prices and greater efficiencies and innovation stem from competition, which is exactly what mergers like the Aetna-Humana deal destroy.
The sophistry that surrounded the deal didn't stop there. Last August, Aetna withdrew from 11 of the 15 states where it was offering individual insurance plans under the Affordable Care Act. The company claimed this was a business decision based on mounting losses in the market. But U.S. Judge John D. Bates, in their decision blocking the merger, called that deceitful: Aetna dropped much of that business, they found, to improve its litigation position in the government lawsuit over the merger.
Bertolini also had asserted in public that Aetna's discussions with the government about the merger and about its participation in the ACA exchanges were “separate conversations.” Internal company documents revealed that Aetna had explicitly tied them together, telling the Justice Department that if it tried to block the merger it would pull out of the exchanges. The department sued to block the merger, and Aetna made good on its threat.
Now that the merger deal is dead, let's turn to the cost of the funeral.
The biggest single chunk is a $1-billion termination fee that Aetna now owes to Humana. Traditionally, such breakup fees are owed by the selling company (Humana, in this case) to the buyer; the idea is to discourage the seller from shopping around for a higher bidder.
Technically speaking, the Aetna arrangement is a “reverse termination fee” owed by the buyer to the seller. These have become more common on deals that are vulnerable to regulatory challenge. The goal, according to Afra Afsharipour, a law professor at UC Davis whose specialties include mergers and acquisitions, is to compensate the target for the disruption that results from a blocked merger.
Aetna's is at the low end of the range of such fees, coming to about 2.9% of the value of the transaction. Typically they're closer to 4%. Anthem, for example, will have to pay Cigna a $1.85-billion fee, or 3.4%, for its failed $54-billion merger, which was also blocked by a judge and called off by Cigna on Tuesday.
What's problematic about the Aetna case, Afsharipour adds, is that Aetna cited the breakup fee as a reason for the Justice Department to approve the merger, placing it among the costs it would incur if the agency sued. “Their argument was, ‘If you don't allow the deal, we'll have to pay $1 billion,'” they observed. “But they're the ones who agreed to the fee.”
Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and four Democratic colleagues made this very point in a September letter to Bertolini, in which they noted that the companies had ample warning that their merger would invite a stiff regulatory challenge. They called the breakup fee “an expensive and risky bet on a highly uncertain outcome… with consequences that could limit competition in the marketplace and have a negative impact on consumer choice.” They asked, “When Aetna agreed to pay this fee, was Aetna aware that it would endanger participation in the ACA exchanges?” It isn't clear if they ever got an answer.
There's more to the cost of the failed merger. In June, Aetna floated $13 billion in bonds to fund the merger. It was the third-largest bond deal of the year up to that point, at interest rates ranging from 1.9% to 4.375% a year. The bond issuance cost Aetna $82.5 million in commissions and fees, according to the bond prospectus. On Tuesday, the company said it would buy back all the bonds at 101% of their face value, at a cost of $13 million. The company also owes interest from June to mid-March, when the repurchase will be done, which we figure will come to about $304 million. Total bond expenses: about $400 million.
Finally, there are the transaction costs — lawyers, accountants and other money crunchers. Aetna reported “transaction and integration-related costs” of $517 million last year and $258 million in 2015, which it attributed jointly to the Humana deal and its acquisitions of Coventry Health Care and Bswift, a retail technology company. But the $6.9-billion Coventry deal closed in 2013 and the $400-million bswift acquisition in 2014, so most of the $775 million in transaction costs in 2015 and 2016 was likely due to Humana. Let's conservatively add another $400 million to the invoice.
MGM and Warner Bros. have tapped up-and-coming director Steven Caple Jr. to direct Michael B. Jordan and Sylvester Stallone in “Creed 2,” sources tell Variety, with production expected to start in spring 2018.
Along with Jordan and Stallone, Tessa Thompson will also return for the sequel, reprising their role as Bianca.
Sources also say that Ryan Coogler, who directed “Creed,” is expected to join in an executive producer role, though a deal has not yet closed, as Coogler is currently wrapping up post-production on Marvel's “Black Panther.”
Stallone had considered directing “Creed 2” at one point, but after talking it over with Jordan and the execs, they made the decision to find another director. After a lengthy search, Jordan and Stallone personally picked Caple to take the reins.
Caple will direct from an original screenplay written by Stallone and Cheo Hodari Coker (showrunner of “Luke Cage”) based on characters from the Rocky franchise. The film is being produced by Irwin Winkler, Charles Winkler, William Chartoff, David Winkler, and Kevin King-Templeton. Jordan and Guy Riedel will executive produce.
“We could not be more fortunate and excited about the collaboration of Steven, Sly, Michael and the producers, to build upon the success of ‘Creed,'” said Jonathan Glickman, MGM's president, motion picture group. “The combination of Steven's talent and unique vision makes them the perfect director to continue the Rocky franchise's storied lineage.”
The upcoming installment follows Adonis Creed (Jordan)'s life inside and outside of the ring as they deal with new-found fame, issues with their family, and their continuing quest to become a champion.
“It's an honor to be a part of such an iconic franchise and to work with such great collaborators,” Caple said. “Mike, Sly, and Tessa are extraordinarily talented and bring something special to today's culture. I look forward to joining the family and continuing the precedent set by this franchise's alumni of incredible filmmakers.”
Production is set to begin in Philadelphia in March.
“We recognized Steven's talent for telling ambitious stories with incredible heart in ‘The Land,'” said producer Irwin Winkler. “We are confident what they will bring to ‘Creed 2' will result in a story that resonates with audiences all over the world.”
The gig is Caple's first feature at a major studio. Insiders say their work on the IFC pic “The Land,” Caple's coming-of-age tale that they directed right out of USC, was a big selling point for Jordan, Stallone, and the execs. “The Land” premiered at the 2016 Sundance Film Festival and tells the story of four teenage boys who devote their summer to escaping the streets of Cleveland to pursue a dream life of professional skateboarding.
“The character of Adonis Creed reflects this generation and its challenges,” Stallone said. “I believe it's important for the director to also be a part of this generation like I was in mine, to make the story as relatable as possible. We are extremely lucky to have the talented young filmmaker Steven Caple Jr. step up and accept the role of director. I am confident that they and Michael B. Jordan will hit it out of the park!”
MGM recently announced that it was back in the theatrical distribution game and will handle domestic distribution rights for “Creed 2,” with WB handling international.
The movie is dated for Nov. 21, 2018. The most recent “Creed” completely revamped the Rocky series, not only grossing $110 million at the domestic box office, but also earning Stallone an Oscar nomination for their performance.
While plot details about the sequel are still vague, Stallone had hinted that the story would revolve around the Ivan Drago character who infamously killed Creed's father Apollo in “Rocky IV.”
Caple recently wrote HBO's high-profile Emmett Till project, produced by Will Smith and Jay-Z. Their directing credits include the season finale of Freeform's upcoming “Grown-ish.” Forbes named Caple one of this year's 30 Under 30 in Hollywood & Entertainment.
Capel is repped by WME and Untitled Entertainment. Jordan is represented by WME; Stallone is represented by WME; and Thompson is represented by Green & Associates Talent Agency, Mosaic, and Jackoway Tyerman.
More Laws, More Restrictions… But Waitaminute!
By Dave Workman
Less than 12 hours after the 32nd annual Gun Rights Policy Conference wrapped up in Dallas last Sunday, a madman opened fire on a crowd of thousands in Las Vegas, and the reaction from anti-gun politicians and lobbying groups was as predictable as Seattle rains in November.
“We need to beef up our gun control laws,” say gun control advocates. Writing in The Nation, Washington editor George Zornick declared that purchasing 33 firearms over the course of 12 months should be illegal.
According to Zornick, “the gun control movement…needs to push for action on reducing the number and kinds of weapons that Americans can possess. Creating a nationwide registry of gun owners and their firearms would be a start, along with enacting federal laws that prohibit more than one handgun purchase per month.”
The only use of a handgun in Sunday night's horror appears to have been the shot Paddock fired through their mouth and the back of their skull with what appeared to be a J-frame Smith & Wesson, according to a gruesome image that has circulated this week. But this is a way gun control proponents slip in part of their long-standing agenda.
Is anybody up for a national gun registry?
Hillary Rodham Clinton rushed to a microphone to attack the proposed Hearing Protection Act that would make suppressors (aka “silencers”) more available to more shooters, without all the government red tape.
Sen. Dianne Feinstein, California's inveterate gun control extremist, introduced legislation to ban the “bump stock,” an aftermarket device that fits semi-auto rifles enabling users to mimic the rate of fire of a full auto machine gun. They would ultimately like to ban semi-auto sport-utility (“modern sporting”) rifles, and they are no fan of concealed carry.
Killer Stephen Paddock's monstrous crime is likely to be used as fodder to turn back concealed carry reciprocity, even though they didn't cross a state line to commit mayhem with a concealed handgun. Published reports uniformly include references to so-called “universal background checks,” as though no such checks exist.
But Paddock passed numerous background checks when purchasing firearms at retail. That fact seems to be overlooked, probably because it doesn't fit the narrative, say some gun rights activists.
According to John Lott, who spoke at the weekend Gun Rights conference, there are now an estimated 16.5 million Americans who are licensed to carry. One official at one state agency discussing concealed carry with Insider Online earlier this week predicted that after Las Vegas, that number is likely to go up fast.
There are now an estimated 16.5 million concealed carry permits and licenses in the United States.
Some people think that number will spike in the wake of the Las Vegas outrage.
Republicans ‘Shelve' Hearing Act, Delay Action
Predictably, House GOP leaders announced that the Hearing Protection Act has reportedly been “shelved” for the time being.
It's also doubtful that there will be any action on the proposed concealed carry reciprocity act. According to the Chicago Tribune, “a vote on that measure…seemed unlikely.”
At the same time, it doesn't appear that Democrat demands for tougher gun laws will make any headway, either. Capitol Hill is at its favorite place: Deadlock.
However, Gun Rights Groups Take Initiative
Reacting to the Las Vegas massacre, three gun rights groups have taken the initiative and it just might back the prohibition lobby and Capitol Hill anti-gunners into a corner.
The National Rifle Association on Thursday called on the ATF to “review” the controversial “bump stock” device to determine if it is legal. In a statement, the NRA decried the Las Vegas attack while noting, “In Las Vegas, reports indicate that certain devices were used to modify the firearms involved. Despite the fact that the Obama administration approved the sale of bump fire stocks on at least two occasions, the National Rifle Association is calling on the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (BATFE) to immediately review whether these devices comply with federal law.”
And then the Second Amendment Foundation and Citizens Committee for the Right to Keep and Bear Arms issued a joint statement calling for “a productive dialogue concerning ‘bump stocks,' National Concealed Carry Reciprocity and the Hearing Protection Act.”
This puts the gun prohibition lobby in a tough spot. For years they have been calling for a “dialogue” that presumably involves some give and take (rather than just demand and take, then demand more). Anti-gunners have zeroed in on “bump stocks.” But if they want something they need to give ground on reciprocity and hearing protection, otherwise they're a crowd of hypocrites.
Guns Not Necessary For Mass Murder
Back on Bastille Day (July 14) in 2016, a terrorist identified as Mohamed Lahouaiej Bouhlel drove a large truck through a crowd of people in Nice, France.
When they came to a stop there was an exchange of gunfire with police. When the smoke cleared, Bouhlel was dead, but so were 86 of the people they struck with the truck. That's more people than were killed in Las Vegas.
This is not intended to lessen the brutality and horror of the Las Vegas slaughter, but it does illustrate the fact that mass killers don't always use guns.
On April 19, 1995, Timothy McVeigh left a truck filled with a fertilizer bomb that exploded in front of the Murrah Building in Oklahoma City. The blast killed 168 people and injured more than 680 others, according to an account at Wikipedia. They didn't shoot any of them.
And One More Thing…
The District of Columbia decided this week not to appeal their concealed carry loss to the U.S. Supreme Court.
The city's “good cause” requirement to get a carry permit was declared unconstitutional in July by a three-judge panel of the U.S. District Court of Appeals for Washington, D.C. When the city sought a full review by an en banc panel of all judges on the court, the request was rejected.
The city had a tough choice. They could take the case to the high court, but if they lost – which seemed highly probable – a court ruling that declared “good cause” requirements unconstitutional would threaten similar laws in several states including California, Hawaii, New York, New Jersey and Maryland.
The alternative: bite the bullet and start issuing carry permits to any qualified applicant. Pressure on the city to not take their case to the Supremes was likely intense. The city essentially fell on the proverbial sword, allowing the state gun laws to remain intact, at least for the time being.
But as SAF's Alan Gottlieb noted, “this decision opens the gate farther to an inevitable high court confrontation because there are now conflicting opinions on concealed carry from the different circuit courts. Common sense says that the 14th Amendment's equal protection clause will not allow that conflict to continue.”
The case was brought by SAF. It's known as Wrenn v. District of Columbia.

The effort by congressional Republicans and the Trump White House to sabotage the Affordable Care Act reached another milestone Friday when the big insurer Anthem announced it will be pulling out of Virginia's ACA marketplace next year.
Anthem has been the biggest insurer in the Virginia individual market. Its enrollment base of 165,000 in 2017 is nearly three times the size of the No. 2 insurer, Kaiser, which has 60,000.
In its statement announcing its flight, Anthem cited “a shrinking and deteriorating individual market, as well as continual changes and uncertainty in federal operations, rules and guidance, including cost sharing reduction subsidies and the restoration of taxes on fully insured coverage.” Anthem said it will leave the individual market in Virginia except for sales of off-exchange plans, which aren't eligible for premium or cost-sharing subsidies, in Scott and Washington counties and the city of Bristol, which are on the border of North Carolina.
Anthem...[cited] the President's threats to cut off cost-sharing reduction payments...and their deliberate efforts to dismantle the individual insurance market. — Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe in a released statement
The statement may have been couched in bureaucratese, but its meaning was unmistakable. The references are to policies and politics of the GOP Congress and the administration. Their dithering already has led to increases nationwide of as much as 23% in requested insurance premiums for next year, according to an analysis by the Kaiser Family Foundation.
The flight of insurers from Virginia and other states has occurred as Obamacare's popularity is rising. The program notched its highest favorable reading ever, according to Kaiser Family Foundation's ACA tracking poll, reaching 52% this month — its first such reading above 50% since July 2010, just after its enactment. (To check on demographic, political, and income breakdowns, see KFF's interactive chart here. The public's regard for the law has risen steadily since the November election, possibly because the Republican threat to coverage has become more tangible.
The cost-sharing reduction subsidies, as we have reported numerous times, are payments the federal government makes to ACA insurers to reduce or eliminate deductibles and co-pays charged to customers earning less than 250% of the federal poverty level, or $61,500 for a family of four this year. They were thrown into doubt when the House GOP sued to block them in 2014, arguing that because the money hadn't been specifically appropriated, paying the subsidies is illegal.
They won the first round in U.S. District Court last year, but the judge stayed their ruling pending an appeal. Since then the subsidies have been in limbo. Under President Trump, the government has continued to pay the subsidies, but they haven't said whether he'll continue the Obama administration's defense of them in the appeals court, and they constantly hint at shutting them off as a way of forcing the ACA to “implode.” On Aug. 1, the appeals court granted 17 states and the District of Columbia, led by California and New York, the right to defend the subsidies if Trump bails out. About $7 billion in payments to insurers with about 7 million ACA customers are at issue this year.
The other acts of sabotage include the soft-pedaling of the individual mandate by the Trump Department of Health and Human Services. HHS has indicated in word and deed that it won't be enforcing the individual mandate, which compels individuals to carry health insurance, as rigorously as the Obama administration. That would raise insurer costs by skewing their customer pool more toward older and sicker customers, who have greater incentive to buy coverage regardless of the mandate.
The administration reportedly also has cut back or eliminated outreach to community groups and affinity organizations such as the League of United Latin American Citizens which the previous administration counted on to get out the word and sign up lower-income customers eligible for premium- and cost-sharing subsidies under the ACA.
The harvest has been the departure of several major insurers, including Aetna, Humana and Cigna from the ACA marketplace, despite signs — noticed, among others, by the Congressional Budget Office and Standard & Poor's — that the individual market was stabilizing and earnings improving in 2017.
KFF At 52% favorability, the ACA's popularity has never been higher, and it's rising, according to this poll by the Kaiser Family Foundation. At 52% favorability, the ACA's popularity has never been higher, and it's rising, according to this poll by the Kaiser Family Foundation. (KFF)
After sticking with the individual market through this year, Anthem has recently stepped up its withdrawals, announcing its departure from all or portions of Wisconsin, Georgia and Nevada.
Virginia's Democratic governor, Terry McAuliffe, released a statement saying that company officials were blunter about their reasoning in a conversation with them than in their public statement. “Anthem leadership [cited] the President's threats to cut off cost-sharing reduction payments to insurers and their deliberate efforts to dismantle the individual insurance market,” they said. We've asked Anthem to comment on McAuliffe's version, but haven't heard back as of this posting.
Anthem's abandonment of Virginia, where it had a 56% share of the ACA market, is a blow that will force state healthcare officials to scurry to find alternatives for residents. One insurer, Optima Health has said it will offer coverage in counties that otherwise would be left without insurers. But Optima already has revised its rate request for 2018 from an increase of 9.8% over 2017 rates to an increase of 19.3%, in part to reflect possible changes in federal policies and rules.

In a grassy corner of the Ontario Agricultural College (OAC), near the end of September 1907, the anxious freshmen stood together in a crowd.
In their midst was a tall pole where their flag — a red cloth — hung in the air. Facing them was the sophomore class, planning their assault. The occasion was first flag fight, a part of the annual initiation of the freshmen into the student body of the college.
Since its founding, each sophomore class at the OAC took responsibility for initiation of the freshmen. Far from the genteel Orientation Week at today's University of Guelph, early initiations typically involved filth, combat and a dose of humiliation. The sophomores varied the routine each year but it frequently involved wrestling, rending of clothing and putrid missiles or showers. The sophomore class of 1907 decided on something a little different. They came up with the flag fight — a pitched battle — and prohibited any form of weaponry such as rotten eggs or knotted towels.
The annual initiation was a local spectacle watched by many Guelphites — as well as the girls of the nearby Macdonald Hall, which surely raised the stakes for the male participants.
It seems that the flag fight impressed the townsfolk so much that Mr. Alexander Petrie, owner of a local drugstore, among other enterprises, had photos of the event turned into a series of postcards. The postcards present the combat in four phases: (1) The Challenge, in which the freshmen on the left surrounding their flag await the charge of the sophomores massing on the right; (2) The Attack, in which sophomores attempt to break through the pack, climb the pole, and tear down the flag; (3) The Repulse, in which the freshmen fend off the attackers and individual wrestling matches break out; and (4) The Finish, in which the sophomores give up after 20 minutes or so, leaving the field to the freshmen. As the final photo shows, few participants left the field with their shirts and hats intact, long considered a signature of OAC initiations. Many sported shiners and bloody noses too.
The flag fight became an enduring part of initiation at the OAC in later years, although each sophomore class changed its conditions as it saw fit. In 1908, for example, the sophomores introduced the use of eggs and tomatoes, liberated from campus labs and nearby gardens, as missiles to soften up their opponents. The stratagem worked — the sophomores were able to tear down the flag and win the contest.
The flag fight was typical of the sort of hazing rituals then common in colleges. The rationale for these rituals is disputed. They may be intended to foster group solidarity, express dominance for one group over another, or identify committed group members. S.J. Neville, one of the sophomores who organized the 1907 event, reported that it established goodwill between the freshmen and themselves, who they described as "natural enemies" otherwise.
Neville expressed dismay with other occasions when the flag fight was more vicious. In 1913, for example, the sophomores doused the freshmen with a mixture of water, tar and carbon disulphide — a noxious chemical known to cause tingling or numbness, cramps, muscle weakness, pain, distal sensory loss, and neurophysiological impairment. Neville reports that, not surprisingly, this display of dominance resulted in a lot of bad blood between the two classes thereafter.
Authorities sought to curtail initiations. Nocturnal events were banned at the OAC in 1916. In 1922, the flag fight was the only event allowed. Initiations were banned in Ontario universities in 1926; however, the flag fight continued for some time at the OAC, perhaps because it was governed by the Ministry of Agriculture.
Today, however, the flag fight and the sort of college initiation it exemplified are but a memory recorded for us in Mr. Petrie's popular postcards.

BENGALURU: India and Russia are nearing a joint venture to make light helicopters in India, reviving a plan announced by Russian President Vladimir Putin in 2015.
Delhi needs to replace hundreds of ageing utility helicopters deployed along its Himalayan border with China as well as in the disputed Kashmir region.
This means an initial order of 200 Kamov-226 helicopters, of which 140 will be built in India as part of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's drive to build a domestic defence industrial base and cut imports, is expected to be increased.
And final documents relating to the $1 billion Kamov deal involving Russian Helicopters, Rosoboronexport and India's state-run Hindustan Aeronautics (HAL) has been submitted to Putin, HAL's chief T. Suvarna Raju, told reporters on Wednesday.
While India has sealed deals with the United States for 22 Apache attack and 15 heavy lift Chinook helicopters at total cost of about $2.5 billion, plans to buy Russian helicopters and fifth generation fighter aircraft have been dogged by problems.
"There are issues between parties, but these are being tackled," Sergey Goreslavsky, deputy director general of Rosoboronexport, said at India's biggest air show in the southern city of Bengaluru.
A team will assess the Indian manufacturing facilities over the next few months. "We are keeping our fingers crossed about launching production this year," an executive at Russian Helicopters said.
The executive, who did not want to be named, said the joint venture will be modelled along the lines of Brahmos, the India-Russia entity producing supersonic missiles, which which military analysts say are among the deadliest in their class.
Russia was long the main supplier of military equipment to India, but Delhi has turned to France, Israel and increasingly the United States for supply of hardware in recent years.
US aerospace and defence firms Lockheed Martin and Boeing have both offered to set up production lines in India to make combat planes.

The new OM654 turbo-diesel engine from Mercedes-Benz displaces 1,950 cc with its four cylinders. It was first seen in the new E 220 d producing 194 PS and 400 Nm. Mercedes-Benz had stated then that the motor was capable of well over 120 PS/litre in terms of specific output. We expected a 250 d with about 240 PS and 500 Nm to replace the aging 2,143-cc turbo-diesel presently doing duty with 204 PS and 500 Nm. However, the new ‘300 d' engine specification has made its début.
In the new CLS 300 d, the 1,950-cc turbo-diesel engine delivers 245 PS at 4,200 rpm and a full 500 Nm now in a much more accessible and considerably wider torque band of 1,600-2,400 rpm. The engine is paired to the 9G-Tronic nine-speed automatic transmission driving the rear wheels. This is, of course, the entry diesel model for the ‘C257' third-generation pioneering four-door coupé. The top speed is 250 km/h. It will be available in Germany at a retail price of €60,571 (Rs 49 lakh).
The same engine is expected to follow suit and replace the ‘250 d' models in the C-Class saloon, coupé and convertible model lines, E-Class model line, as well as a potential entry-level S 300 d in the future, among others. Watch this space.

The feel-good trend of NFL fans giving to player's charities has made its way to the Alex Smith Foundation.
I just made a donation to the alex smith foundation in appreciation for the time they played here in KC. Would encourage you do so as well. #AlexSmith #AlexSmithTrade https://t.co/v8cbjRRpPF â David Mertz (@DMertz_GDR) January 31, 2018
On Tuesday, Smith was traded -- in principle -- to Washington in exchange for CB Kendall Fuller and a third-round pick in this year's draft. The Pro Bowl QB took the Chiefs to the playoffs in four of their five seasons in Kansas City and led the league in passer rating (104.7) in 2017.
Though there is excitement over officially ushering in the Patrick Mahomes era, some Chiefs fans, like the one above, wanted to thank Smith for making Kansas City a perennial playoff team.
Thank you, Alex, for all you did for #ChiefsKingdom. Best of luck in Washington.
I think this is a brilliant way for @Chiefs fans to be thanking Alex. Well done @ArrowheadPride for sharing the idea. Here is the link If you want to donate & say thanks too:https://t.co/J2VBOcyWhW pic.twitter.com/xiWkN7rY42 â Blake Clarensau (@BlakeClarensau) February 1, 2018
The donation amount of $11 represents Smith's Chiefs jersey number. According to its website, The Alex Smith Foundation "provides foster teens with the tools and resources needed to transition to successful adulthood by developing and promoting mentoring, education, housing, internship, job, and advocacy programs."
As of Friday morning, Smith's wife, Elizabeth, said donations had topped $45,000.
Thank you, Alex, for all you did for #ChiefsKingdom. Best of luck in Washington.

Double eviction week in the Big Brother house is always tense. Fans and houseguests are permanently on edge as the battle for Head of Household, Power of Veto and the live eviction play out within a few nail-biting minutes. But nothing could prepare the BBCAN5 Odyssey for what was about to happen when the first double eviction shook up this season as Emily Hawkin and the season's veteran queenpin Neda Kalantar exited the house after a shocking major-alliance mutiny.
“I don't know how you're supposed to come to terms with losing out on your dream the second time,” Neda said in much better spirits than how fans last saw them when they exited the house in tears on Thursday night.
The evening's events escalated so quickly once their close ally Sindy Nguyen won the HoH competition and put Dillon Carman and Jackie McCurrach immediately on the block. But when Jackie saved themselves with a veto win, Sindy was swayed by Ika Wong into backdooring Neda – even though they were all members of The Six alliance, who had been dominating the game all season.
The three faced off in a screaming match in the pantry before Neda was eventually evicted by a 7-1 vote.
“Sindy likes to make big moves for television. I think Sindy just took that opportunity to do it,” Neda explained, walking Postmedia Network through one of the most jaw-dropping evictions in the Canadian reality franchise's history.
“It was really tense. Me and Ika are really intense people already so for us to be going at each other, everyone's faces were like ‘What the heck is going on right now?' When I was named as the replacement nominee, I just kind of wanted to tell Sindy to stop their fake crying. That's all I wanted to say.”
But the 25-year-old entrepreneur stated that they knew Ika would turn on them eventually, as there were cracks in their alliance from the very beginning of the game.
“It really started early on. From Day 3, there was always something maybe every other day that happened with Ika where they were just an emotional person and very exhausting to work with. It was just a long time coming where the trust was getting chipped away.”
But Emily – who exited the Odyssey just prior to the drama – believes that it was the immunity advantage that Canada gifted Neda that really impacted how they played the game this season by contributing to how they treated people.
“That makes me so happy. Oh my god. That is fantastic. I love it,” Hawkin said when they found out it was Neda who left the house immediately after them
“I think their whole game strategy would have been different if they didn't get that immunity. I think they started rubbing people the wrong way and was more entitled because they had that immunity and they knew nobody could touch them But for Sindy to do that, it's kind of surprising. It's wicked-awesome but it just goes to show that nobody really trusts Neda 100%.”

Mon, Dec 11: Losing a loved one is a stressful time. But itâ€™s even more stressful when someone in the funeral industry persistently pushes a product. And as Sean Oâ€™Shea reports, itâ€™s shocking when the salesperson unleashes a barrage of expletives when you say no.
DUBLIN - When Leo Varadkar's Indian father, Ashok, moved to Ireland in the 1970s, they chose one of Western Europe's most socially conservative countries to call home.
Thirty-eight years later, their youngest child became the once-staunchly Catholic country's first openly gay prime minister, its first of Indian descent and the youngest person ever to hold the office.
Varadkar's election in parliament on Wednesday, 10 days after they succeeded Enda Kenny as leader of the governing Fine Gael party, marks another symbolic moment for Ireland.
“If my election today shows anything, it is that prejudice has no hold in this Republic,” Varadkar said to huge applause on June 2 after winning the leadership of the centre-right party.
“I know when my father travelled 5,000 miles to build a new home in Ireland, I doubt that they ever dreamed that one day their son would grow up to be its leader and despite their differences, their son would be judged by their actions not their identity.”
“Every proud parent in Ireland today can dream big dreams for their children,” Varadkar said.
The fact the milestone of electing a gay premier is barely mentioned in local media and has taken place - in the words of one former government minister - “without anybody batting an eyelid” shows just how far Ireland has come.
Instead, after six years of Kenny's steady flight attendantship, the focus has been on the stark change of style likely to follow the election of a minister known as a straight talker. Colleagues giddily proclaim that their new leader has the ‘X Factor'.
Varadkar had not been born when Kenny, 66, was first elected as a member of parliament and comes from the generation hit hardest by Ireland's economic meltdown. They owned an apartment that fell into negative equity at the turn of the decade.
They will also be a year younger than France's Emmanuel Macron when they attend their first EU leaders summit later this month. But Varadkar has been quick to point out that the favourite to become Austria's new prime minister, Sebastian Kurz, is eight years younger.
“He's a once-in-a-generation politician,” said Fine Gael member of parliament Jim Daly, echoing the comments of most of their colleagues who have placed high hopes in Varadkar.
Such a dramatic change of style could go two ways, analysts warn. Varadkar's tendency to shoot from the hip can backfire. As a novice minister they said Ireland would likely need a second bailout six months after signing its 2010 EU/IMF package.
Colleagues were furious and Ireland went on to exit the bailout on schedule in 2013.
“When you're Taoiseach (prime minister), you can't speak as open and freely as when you're a maverick, straight-shooting minister. If they don't temper their more colourful contributions, that could actually become a liability quite quickly,” said Theresa Reidy, a politics lecturer at University College Cork.
They said that although they have held three cabinet post since 2011, Varadkar is relatively inexperienced. With the exception of Kenny, every prime minister since the 1960s either served as finance or foreign minister prior to taking office.
Kenny sat in parliament for 35 years before their elevation. Varadkar was first elected in 2007.
Seen as being on the right wing of the centrist Fine Gael, Varadkar also upset Ireland's left with a recent publicity campaign highlighting social welfare fraud.
And their management style will be tested by Fine Gael's weak minority government that is backed by independent lawmakers and facilitated by the main opposition party.
As someone who once described themselves as not being “a natural people's person”, the trained doctor will need a good bedside manner.
“We don't really know how they will react under pressure and it is different when you're Taoiseach,” Reidy said.

Despite only outselling the Honda Ridgeline and the GMC Canyon last year, the new Nissan Titan has a lot going for it. It's been recently redesigned, looks a lot better than the old Titan, offers a 390-hp V-8 as standard, and in Titan XD form, it can out-tow every other standard full-size pickup. But while Nissan had previously said it plans to add a V-6 to the lineup, according to the latest report, it still hasn't decided when to do so.
Recently, AutoGuide decided to check in with Nissan to see if it had any new information on when the six-cylinder Titan would go on sale. Considering it's been nearly two years since we first heard the Titan would get a V-6, it was a fair question. Sadly, Nissan's response wasn't very encouraging.
“We did confirm that a V-6 will be coming,” said the Nissan spokesperson. “However, that's all we are able to say as of now–no official timetable.”
The good news is the six-cylinder Titan hasn't been canceled. At least not yet. But anyone who has been holding out for the V-6 should probably look elsewhere. That's too bad, too, because a basic single-cab Titan with a V-6 would make a nice, practical truck for a lot of people.
Then again, Nissan could simply be overwhelmed by demand at the moment. Last year, Chevrolet sold about 10 times as many Silverados as Nissan sold Titans, but if you compare it to the previous generation, the new Titan has been a huge success. In 2016, the first full year that the redesigned truck was available, sales nearly doubled. Last year, sales more than doubled.
So over the last two years, Nissan more than quadrupled Titan sales, something we consider pretty impressive. Even if we still wish we could get the Titan with a dang V-6.

Elon Musk has big dreams for Puerto Rico. On Thursday, the Tesla Inc. chief executive said they would discuss building a high-tech solar grid for the island with Ricardo Rossello, Puerto Rico's governor.
"Let's talk," Rossello tweeted at Musk.
"I would be happy to talk," Musk replied. "Hopefully, Tesla can be helpful."
Although Musk's idea doesn't solve Puerto Rico's current crisis — 90% of the island is still without power, and many are having trouble getting clean water — it could set the island on the path to sustainable, renewable energy, which could reduce its dependence on imported fossil fuels and ultimately bolster its economy. The proposal, in other words, makes a great deal of sense, even if it doesn't help right away.
Puerto Rico's electric company already was in shambles. In July, it basically filed for bankruptcy, saying it owed $9 billion and needed an additional $4 billion to revamp its power plants, whose median age is 40 years old.
That was before Hurricane Maria struck. Now, in light of the damage to Puerto Rico's electric grid, people such as Musk are seeing the crisis as a chance for the island to move away from centralized, vulnerable electricity systems.
"The Tesla team has done this for many smaller islands around the world, but there is no scalability limit, so it can be done for Puerto Rico too. Such a decision would be in the hands of the PR govt, PUC, any commercial stakeholders and, most importantly, the people of PR," Musk posted Thursday on Twitter.
Among the "many smaller islands" to which Musk is referring is the island of Ta'u in American Samoa. Last year, Tesla said it had wired Ta'u with thousands of solar panels and batteries that would meet nearly all of the energy needs of its 600 residents. It was an example of how, under the right conditions, an island population could shift almost entirely away from fossil fuels.
According to Musk, there's no reason something similar couldn't be achieved in Puerto Rico.
Musk isn't exactly going out on a limb here. Scientists and energy experts say that a distributed grid that doesn't rely on a single power plant for energy generation could help vulnerable island regions such as the Caribbean weather strong storms like Irma or Maria.
Solar panels, which can feed their power into batteries and be linked together into local or regional power grids, are one example of a technology that could spread the potential risk out across a population. And at tropical latitudes, you get the most bang for your solar buck: Photovoltaic panels located there are even more effective at energy generation than they are at higher latitudes.
The long-term economic benefits could be equally transformative. Island residents face some of the highest energy prices in the world because the vast majority of their fuel must be imported. Reducing those fuel costs by switching to wind or solar could permanently set these island economies on a more positive trajectory.
"When we are facing the sort of infrastructure destruction we have seen this hurricane season, it only makes sense to give some pause before reinvesting in the exact same system that proved too vulnerable," Gwen Holdmann, who directs the Alaska Center for Energy and Power at the University of Alaska in Fairbanks, said in an email.
"If [Puerto Rico's] system were redesigned around microgrids incorporating local power production," Holdmann said, "there would still be losses, but the number and duration of outages due to severe weather events would decrease."
So it's really no surprise to see solar advocates such as Musk reaching out to Puerto Rico.

KARACHI - Sindh Minister for Excise and Taxation and Narcotics Control Mukesh Kumar Chawla has said that E&T department has recovered Rs41,646.893 million from July 2016 to March 2017 in various heads compared to Rs34,731 millions collected during same period of last fiscal year.
The minister expressed these remarks while presiding over a meeting in their office here on Monday. ET&NC Secretary Abdul Haleem Shaikh and Director General Shoaib Ahmed Siddiqui also attended the meeting. While briefing the meeting, Siddiqui told that Rs4,445 million were recovered in terms of motor vehicle tax, Rs29,587 million in terms of infrastructure cess, Rs147 million in cotton fee, Rs307 million in professional tax and Rs1,592 million in terms of property tax were collected. The minister, while expressing their satisfaction over the collection of the taxes and performance of the officers, directed the officers to achieve the targets before the financial year ended.
Investigators say three men are facing a total of 101 charges for stealing from relatives, businesses and a church.
Thomas Horne, 20, James Beason, III, 21, and Austin Tindall, 21, are facing 101 charges filed with the Orangeburg County Magistrate's Office ranging from first-degree burglary to petit larceny.
“These individuals started stealing items such as lawn mowers and similar yard equipment before moving up to breaking into at least one church,” Sheriff Leroy Ravenell said. “Fortunately, we've recovered a portion of these items which are on the way back to the owners.”
OCSO officials say another subject is being sought for questioning while more charges could be possible.
According to authorities, at least 20 cases going back to late March involving nearly $30,000 worth of stolen items were closed by the arrests.
Ravenell said the items taken included power lawn equipment, utility trailers, and electronics. Many items were recovered during the search of a Branchville home.
During a hearing on Tuesday and also including a June 9 bond hearing on initial charges, bond was set on Horne at $118,501. Beason's total bond was set at $92,500 while Tindal's was set at $73,000.
“Some people may ask if we're throwing the book at them,” the sheriff said. “Actually we aren't - they threw the book at themselves.”
According to a report, the three were initially charged with a few counts of petit larceny and breaking into a church before discovering a trail of thefts that led from Neeses to Bowman.
"Investigators say the trio or at times a combination of the three stole a four-wheeler and lawn equipment as well as stealing a pressure washer from a local business," OCSO officials said.
The sheriff's office stated that Victim's Advocate Alexis Guinyard told the court the thefts were committed against not only relatives of the subjects but businesses and also at least one church that was broken into.
"A woman who was one of several victims present Tuesday said that their riding mower was taken," authorities said."She said their concern, however, was they felt unsafe due to the mower being only a few steps from them door."
Horne faces 39 charges, including a first-degree burglary, four counts of second-degree burglary, two counts of grand larceny, 10 counts of criminal conspiracy, two counts of malicious injury to real property, one count of malicious injury to personal property, 17 counts of petit larceny, one count of shoplifting, and one count of malicious injury to a place of worship.
Beason is charged with one count of first-degree burglary, three counts of second-degree burglary, two counts of grand larceny, nine counts of criminal conspiracy, one count of malicious injury to real property, one count of malicious injury to personal property, 12 counts of petit larceny, and one count of shoplifting.
Tindall is facing one count of first-degree burglary, three counts of second-degree burglary, one count of grand larceny, seven counts of criminal conspiracy, two counts of malicious injury to real property, two counts of malicious injury to personal property, 15 counts of petit larceny, and one count of shoplifting.

If you want to be part of this initiative, you are welcomed to be at the table. With all that being said, there will be NO PARTICIPATION on behalf of “Our Voice Matters” in the parade or football game."
Many people started New Year's Day quietly getting over the celebrations of the night before.
But Paul Suggitt, from Hartlepool, was up bright and early as they embarked on a challenge that will hopefully see them complete 10,000 miles running, walking or cycling, over the next 365 days.
New Years Day and Paul Suggitt from Hartlepool starts their 10,000miles in 365 days challenge, running, cycling or walking.
The dad of two began their epic task, called the Walk/Run/Ride Challenge, which will see them have to complete roughly the distance of a marathon a day, at 10am yesterday (Sunday) in driving wind and rain.
Paul, 37, was joined by a small group of supporters as they helped them notch up their first mile by running along Hartlepool seafront.
 They are doing it to raise money and awareness for regional charity, the Chris Lucas Trust which raises money for research into an aggressive form of teenager cancer, rhabdomyosarcoma.
Paul, who works as a website and app developer, said: “I thought I need to do something that's going to get me healthy, that pushes me beyond what I'm used to and at the same time help bring awareness to this trust.
“Not a lot of people know about it year it does an absolutely sterling job for children and teenagers with aggressive cancer.”
Paul, of Deer Park, forwent the New Year celebrations, instead preparing for their mammoth task.
They said: “I spent New Year's Eve quietly thinking ‘what have I done?' and about what's going to come.
“I was up at 3am watching the weather when the rain was lashing against the windows.”
After completing yesterday's initial run, Paul set off on their bike to Whitby about 50 miles away.
Working around their day job, they plan to travel all over the country throughout the year to help raise the profile of the charity.
People can follow their progress online where they will be posting regular updates.
They added: “The thing that drives me is the community support I have got behind me.”
Lynn Lucas, who founded the Chris Lucas Trust, after the death of their 18-year-old son Christopher in 2000, said: “It's fantastic what Paul is doing.
“We wish them all the success.”

Several senators are giving away money donated to them by Harvey Weinstein, seeking to distance themselves from the Oscar-winning movie producer as their sexual harassment scandal erupts.
Among them is Sen. Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.), who said they will take the $14,200 that Weinstein has contributed to them and donate it to charities supporting women.
Over the years, Weinstein has given hundreds of thousands of dollars to Democratic politicians and causes, most notably to the presidential campaigns of Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama.
Democratic Sens. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut, Cory Booker of New Jersey, Martin Heinrich of New Mexico and Patrick J. Leahy of Vermont confirmed that they will be donating money given to them by Weinstein to various charities. Those amounts range from $2,700 to $7,800.
A spokesperson for Booker said their campaign has donated the $7,800 received from Weinstein to the New Jersey Coalition Against Sexual Assault, a nonprofit charity organization.
Heinrich is giving the money to Community Against Violence, a nonprofit organization in New Mexico, according to a spokesperson.
Reports on Friday said Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts is returning money to Weinstein, but their office did not reply to a request for comment.
Weinstein is facing accusations from several actores and former employees that they made unwanted sexual advances on them, according to a Thursday report in the New York Times.
The fallout from the scandal is having repercussions in Washington, D.C., affecting numerous politicians who have received money from the liberal movie mogul, including some who have publicly supported women's rights and feminist causes.
During the most recent presidential election, Weinstein threw ritzy fundraising parties for Hillary Clinton that added millions of dollars to their campaign's coffers and were attended by celebrities such as Leonardo DiCaprio and Jennifer Lopez. One of the fundraisers was a Broadway musical concert featuring an appearance by “Hamilton” creator Lin-Manuel Miranda.
Weinstein has also donated to the Clinton Foundation. The foundation says on its official website that Weinstein gave in the range of $100,001 to $250,000 through June 2017.
Obama has had ties to Weinstein for many years, and their daughter Malia worked as an intern for Weinstein Co. in New York this year before entering Harvard University.
Other politicians who have received donations from Weinstein include Sen. Kamala Harris of California, who received $2,500 in 2014 for their campaign to become California's attorney general.
The Clinton Foundation and Harris' office did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Obama could not immediately be reached for comment.

KARACHI, Feb 15 (APP): The launch of Tesco Label products at
Alpha Supermarkets in Pakistan was announced by the British High Commissioner Thomas Drew and Limestone Private Limited at the British Deputy High Commission in Karachi.
According to a statement issued by British Deputy High Commission
here on Wednesday, the Tesco PLC is one of the world's biggest companies and is a British multinational grocery and general merchandise retailer with stores in 12 countries across Asia and Europe.
Tesco products will soon be available at Alpha Supermarkets in
Pakistan including food and nonfood items in three categories: Tesco Goodness, Tesco Finest and Tesco Everyday.
British High Commissioner to Pakistan, Thomas Drew, said on the
occasion that ‘UK brands- especially those as big as Tesco' have
a real advantage in Pakistan, as British brands are so recognisable
already to the many people in Pakistan who have visited the UK.
This is a particularly important year for this to be happening in
Pakistan, as we are celebrating 70 years of UK-Pakistan relations.
While we will, of course, be remembering all the things that have linked
us over the last 70 years, we are just as focused on the future of our relationship. At the heart of this will be increased trade between our
two countries and I hope Tesco's launch is just the start of a new era
of British-Pakistani trade'.

Three suspected cases of the dreaded Monkey Pox have been reported in Rivers State.
This is according to the Commissioner for Health in Rivers state, Professor Princewill Chike, who disclosed this to newsmen in Port Harcourt.
Professor Chike said the state government is watching the victims even as they have been placed under surveillance.
Professor Pincewill Chike said the suspects are identified in Rumuolumeni, Eneka and Rumoimoi all in Obio/Akpor local government area, noting that the ministry have deployed every means to prevent the spread of the disease.
“In Rivers State we have three suspected cases already.
“One is from the Rumuorlumeni area. We saw it and think it is not a serious matter so we have ruled it out.
“Another one is a thirteen year old boy at Eneka. We discovered they took the boy to a native doctor. The parents think they can handle it the native way.
“We have activated our isolation centres and we have put all our Health centres on red alert.
“The University of Port Harcourt Teaching Hospital, UPTH, Braithwaite Memorial Specialist Hospital and all our Primary Health Centres have been reactivated.
“We can assure you that there is no course for alarm because we are on top of the situation,” they said.

The “new” Vi at Aventura recently made its debut during a ribbon-cutting party to celebrate the culmination of a multi-million-dollar remodeling project. On May 24, dozens of guests gathered at the luxury retirement community including Aventura Mayor Enid Weisman and Vice Mayor Gladys Mezrahi along with Vi residents and Vi corporate leadership to mark the facility's “Grand Reveal.”
The massive renovation project, part of a two-year investment in Vi at Aventura, extended to all common areas including the pool, locker and fitness rooms, art studio, and onward reaching every part of the facility. Not only did this remodel touch all of the living and event areas, but it also added two brand new dining options for residents.
According to Vi's Director of Interior Design Misha Mann, “The new facilities are beautiful, but are made even more amazing by Executive Chef Christian Martin's experienced hand, bringing new ingredients and new dishes throughout the new Vi at Aventura.”
Featuring a world traveler interior design theme, the Vi is now alive with color and incorporates a variety of nuances from around the globe. Mann cited examples such as custom-designed carpeting featuring Celtic and Asian symbols; Moroccan-, Spanish-, and Mediterranean-style tiles; Italian light fixtures; and a wall with postcards from Russia, China, South America and other far-flung corners of the world.

“Travel has shaped the lives of our residents, so we wanted the theme to reflect that worldliness,” Mann said. “The redesign creates a mystery that residents can solve over time, while also serving as great conversation pieces.”
In remarks presented at the ceremony, City of Aventura Mayor Enid Wiesman said, “This community is very fortunate to have such a fine organization call our the City home.
“Naturally, we are excited to see Vi at Aventura continue to prosper and grow, while providing the utmost in continued living services to the people in our community who need – and appreciate – their services and quality accommodations most.”
The design team used pops of colors that bring Florida's ambience inside. The redesign also highlights picturesque views of Turnberry Isle Golf Course and lush landscaping from patio and indoor windowed spaces.
Vi at Aventura Executive Director Renee Garvin said designers also improve the functionality of the common areas. All light fixtures feature brand-new LEDs to enhance each area's appearance, and a new platform was built in the Everglades Room to better facilitate meetings and performances. Upgraded audio-visual technology improves the room's acoustics, especially an added hearing loop, which provides a magnetic, wireless signal picked up by hearing aids.
“Our goal was to create different feelings and experiences throughout the community to increase social interactions and encourage residents to truly live in the space,” Garvin said. “We believe they will thoroughly enjoy the many enhancements we've made and the exceptional lifestyle they produce.”
The family of long time resident Dr. Walter Furr is pleased to know their stepfather is in the best care at Vi, but also to see that they are enjoying the upgraded accommodations.
“It's comforting to see Walter taking part in the many meaningful activities here, and making so many new friends in the process,” said Furr's stepdaughter Karyn Cunningham of Palmetto Bay “In fact, we just gathered to celebrate their 96th birthday in the newly renovated dining room – and wow, what a refreshing difference. We are so glad they are here at Vi.”
Vi at Aventura is a place where residents enjoy an uncompromising lifestyle in an extraordinary setting they love calling home. As a Continuing Care Retirement Community, Vi at Aventura combines vibrant independent living with a full continuum of care, including assisted living, memory support, and skilled nursing should the need arise.
Vi at Aventura is located at 19333 West Country Club Drive. To learn more, visit https://miami.viiliving.com, call 888-820-2148, or email Aventura@viliving.com.
THE PAS, Man. — Rising ice and flood waters have forced hundreds of people from their homes in Manitoba.
Jason Small of the Canadian Red Cross says 107 people from the Opaskwayak Cree Nation are being temporarily housed in hotels in The Pas about 500 kilometres northwest of Winnipeg.
RELATED: Looking back at the Winnipeg blizzard that led to the Flood of the Century
They say another 325 people were evacuated from their homes earlier this month from five other First Nations.
Manitoba forecasters issued a flood warning on the weekend for some areas affected by ice jams on the Carrot and Saskatchewan rivers.

The province says water levels were going down in some rivers until storms dumped about 25 millimetres of precipitation on the weekend.
Small says the evacuees are being provided with lodging, food and other living expenses.
“We are doing this on behalf of the federal government and supported by them,” Small said Monday.

The other First Nations affected include the Peguis near Winnipeg, the Sioux Valley and Canupawapka Dakota near Brandon, the Waywayseecappo near Russell and the Long Plain near Portage la Prairie.
Manitoba says it issues warnings when rivers or lakes are expected to exceed flood levels within the next 24 hours.
There was no immediate word on when people might be allowed to return to their homes.

At this moment there are over 500,000 pieces of space debris hurtling around the Earth. Traveling at speeds of up to 40,000 kilometers per hour, a satellite collision with these fragments is enough to damage and even destroy our communications networks
Accion Systems is building the technology to prevent that. The company, which spun out of MIT in 2014, manufactures ion engines that enable satellites to maneuver in space and avoid these collisions.
In an interview for Flux, I sat down with Natalya Bailey, the co-founder and CEO of Accion Systems. They reveal how the company is able to meet the needs of the burgeoning small satellite industry and why legacy manufacturers can't keep up, how she's handled the jump from academia to business, and what she's learned from Bill Swanson of Raytheon about managing a team.
Bailey also discusses how the Apollo mission helped push computing forward, why space exploration is critical for our survival, and how to get more women into STEM fields.
An excerpt of the conversation is published below.
AMLG: Today I'm excited to welcome Natalia Bailey, founder and CEO of Accion Systems. Accion was founded three years ago — they build liquid ion systems that power the electric propulsion in satellites. It's a technology that could change the dynamics in space by enabling satellites to maneuver and reposition, extending their lifetime, which is pretty huge, and could be used for a lot of missions including (one day) interplanetary exploration. Welcome Natalya, great to have you here.
NB: Thanks for having me on the show.
AMLG: Let's jump in. I'd love to hear how you came to found Accion — how did you get where you are now?
NB: My path to founding Accion started with my interest in studying space propulsion and doing research in the field. That brought me to MIT for my PhD in aeronautics and astronautics.
Actually prior to starting there, I was doing my masters at Duke and tried to start a rocket company, with different technology but similar ideas, and that company kind of imploded. I thought that would be my last go at entrepreneurship and startups, so I went to do my PhD and thought I would end up as a professor or at a research lab. And I started working on this new type of ion engine. We ended up getting a lot of interest from industry. The timing was phenomenal — as we were testing proof of concept of this technology the whole industry was getting more interested in smaller satellites. There was this huge technology gap as far as propulsion goes and we were working on exactly the thing that could fill that gap. We had some of the big aerospace companies, the Lockheeds and the Boeings of the world, coming to MIT and trying to license the technology or buy systems from MIT. My research advisor remembered that I had tried to start a company once before so they knew I had entrepreneurial leanings and suggested I try again.
It was in 2012 that my lab mate and I decided to spin out, so we formed a placeholder company to grab the IP. Then I defended my PhD and they dropped out, and we officially spun out in 2014 and hit the ground running.
AMLG: Were you surprised by all the interest coming from these big companies — the Lockheeds, the Boeings? Did you have to ward them off? Was it tempting to license out all the core tech, or did you feel a huge relief that you knew you'd hit on the right opportunity?
NB: Looking back it feels like a pretty clear sign of product market fit. I think it was Marc Andreessen or Ben Horowitz who said, if the market really wants a technology it will pull it out of a company. So even if the team is inexperienced and moving slowly and there are other challenges, if the market really wants something, that strong force can make it happen. We also still live under the fantastical notion that no one out there can necessarily manufacture these systems better than we can, because they're non-traditional for aerospace. There aren't established manufacturing plants or processes at a Lockheed that could make these technologies better than we can. So that was a neat position to be in.
AMLG: It seems crazy that they don't have this capability. Is it just too niche for them to allocate resources? What's the advantage of being a startup doing this?
NB: The technology itself is very different, and the manufacturing. We leverage MEMs fabrication techniques — the same manufacturing lines that are used to make Intel computer processors — we use those to make our thruster chips. A Lockheed, who wouldn't traditionally be making computer processors, doesn't have those capabilities set up.
AMLG: So you found this specific niche that they can't tackle. For listeners that don't know what a propulsion system on a satellite does, can you explain why it's so important?
NB: The main application is for onboard propulsion systems, that's what we're working on. That's different from launching from the surface of the Earth. We deal with when the satellite's already in space. If you look at the progression of a mission, a satellite is launched into orbit on a big bulky rocket that's not very precise, so first it will have to reposition itself to get where it actually intended to go.
Then over the lifetime of the mission, there are always small disturbances pulling the satellite off of its intended track. It has to correct for those, like gravity and atmospheric drag and other perturbations.
You also have to budget for collision avoidance. If NASA notifies you that you're on track to collide with something, you're responsible for moving out of the way. Then at the end of a lifetime of a satellite you're also responsible for de-orbiting it. You can't leave a satellite in orbit indefinitely — that's called space junk and it's a hot button topic for us. So that's one of the most typical missions, but as we start going beyond low-earth orbit, propulsion systems are also useful for transferring orbits, for reaching the moon and Mars and other interplanetary exploration missions.
Can you talk about the concrete applications for the first set of satellites that will be using your technology?
NB: Ultimately the two main applications are imaging or earth observation and communications. Those are the two main applications commercially that we'll be addressing. Our initial batch of customers happens to be folks that can tolerate higher risk. We haven't been launching propulsion systems into space for the past 10 years like some of the more established players would like for their suppliers. So our initial batch of customers is trying to do things like take a small satellite from low-earth orbit to lunar orbit, or trying to demonstrate other novel technology or mission components that haven't been proven before. So we're focusing on those higher risk tolerance customers right now.
AMLG: You mentioned interplanetary and Mars — a bunch of people in the industry are complaining that SpaceX's focus on Mars colonization has pulled attention away from regular rocket launches and supporting the ecosystem of near-earth satellites, and those near-earth satellites are probably most of your customer base. What are your thoughts on that?
NB: Two thoughts on that. First, it's analogous to Apollo in the sense that when you have an incredible, audacious goal that you set out to achieve, the spin-off technologies and other challenges you have to solve along the way are actually extremely beneficial in other areas not just space. Looking at Apollo, you could even argue that some of the returns on that investment were computers in general, and everything else that came out of that program.
AMLG: What did we get specifically out of Apollo in terms of computer advances?
NB: The personal computer was just starting to be thought of around that time, and in a lot of the early Apollo missions everything was done by hand calculations, then later they started to input the punch hole cards into a computer on board. It was right at that transition point to computing, and a lot of money was being funneled into developing it for Apollo. So fans of Apollo say that computers came about because of that program. I think in general, setting big hairy goals for an entire nation to achieve usually ends in a lot of cool spinoff technologies.
The other thing about Mars colonization is, if you think about humankind as a species, if we're around 300-400 years from now, it's probably not because we stayed put on Earth. For our long-term preservation, it's worth starting to explore other planets in the solar system and hopefully eventually beyond that.
AMLG: Where did this interest in exploring other planets come from. You grew up in Oregon right? What was that like and how did you get interested in space?
NB: Growing up in Oregon was great. It was very outdoorsy, I don't really remember spending any time indoors. I would spend nights outside on my trampoline. In Oregon there's not a lot of light pollution so I could look at the stars. I would think about aliens and then notice these very solid specks of light moving across the sky and I realized they weren't airplanes. So I tried to figure out what they could be and realized I was watching the space station. Mostly I wanted to study aliens but my family is quite practical so I decided to combine that with math, which I loved, and ended up in aerospace engineering. I haven't looked back since.
AMLG: Were you always interested in science? Were your parents interested in science?
NB: Yeah. My dad was a biologist. I was always gathering bugs and studying them and keeping them in tanks in my bedroom until my parents found them. In school I started excelling in math and found that it came easily to me. That combined with the science and alien bit led me to engineering.
AMLG: When you talk about aliens I think of one of my favorite books by Carl Sagan — Contact. I don't know if you ever watched the movie or read the book, but I picture you like Ellie in that film. She's this brilliant scientist and stumbles across something big.
NB: I've definitely seen it. I'm currently making my way through Carl Sagan's original Cosmos again.
AMLG: I love the original Cosmos. I'm a huge Carl Sagan fan, I love their voice he's so inspiring to listen to. Talking about books, I know you're an avid reader. Did any books in particular influence you or your path to building Accion?
NB: Well I'm a gigantic Harry Potter fan and a lot of things around Accion are named after various aspects of Harry Potter including the name Accion itself.
AMLG: Is that the Accio spell? The beckoning spell?
NB: Yes exactly. My co-founder and I were g-chatting late one night on a weekend and looking through a glossary of Harry Potter spells trying to name the company. Accio, the summoning spell, if you add an “N” to the end of it, it becomes a concatenation between “accelerate” and “ion” which is what we do. That's the official story of how we named the company, but really it was from the glossary of spells.

When veteran New York rocker Frankie Rose moved out to Los Angeles at the beginning of the decade, they dove straight into releasing a string of solo albums, the most recent of which was 2013's Herein Wild. After taking a quick detour with Beverly in 2014, she's back to releasing music under their own name. Today, she's announced their new album, Cage Tropical, whose creation actually coincided with a move back to New York. They recorded it with Jorge Elbrecht, and it was inspired by old horror and sci-fi movie soundtracks. “I love old sci-fi. They Live is one of my favorite movies ever, same with Suspiria,” they said in a press release. “80's sci-fi movies with a John Carpenter soundtrack, with silly synths – that makes it into my file, to the point that I'll write lyrics incorporating that kind of stuff. It's in there.” Cage Tropical's first single, “Trouble,” certainly bares some of that influence, with a creeping and pulsating beat blinking underneath Rose's dreamy vocals. Watch a visual for the new track below.
Cage Tropical is out 8/11 via Slumberland/Grey Market.

JONNY BAIRSTOW is confident England can finally put all the off-pitch distractions behind them in order to hit back against Australia and go on to retain The Ashes.
The current tour Down Under seems to have created as much media interest for what has gone on off the pitch as on it, as Yorkshire's Bairstow knows only too well to their cost.
As if the furore over their ‘headbutt' on Cameron Bancroft in Perth before the Test series had not been enough, the weekend's revelations concerning Lions tour party member Ben Duckett pouring a drink over James Anderson's head gave the collective press, TV and internet media plenty more material to chew over ahead of this week's third and, possibly, deciding Test in Perth.
Duckett, 23, has since been suspended for the remainder of the England Lions tour of Australia and received a final written warning over their conduct.
But, coming on top of Bairstow's bizarre ‘coming together' with Bancroft in a Perth bar and the much-publicised pre-tour incident in Bristol concerning all-rounder and vice-captain Ben Stokes – currently keeping their eye in playing some 40-over cricket over in New Zealand – it has led to an unprecedented level of scrutiny on what England's players do once off the field of play.
Bairstow admits it has been difficult to avoid all the negative publicity over the past few weeks – of which they have formed a central part – but believes only by getting their game right out in the middle can England start to create headlines and take up air time for the right reasons.
“There's been a lot of stuff spoken about since we've been over here,” said Bairstow, speaking ahead of the third Test at the WACA, which starts on Thursday. “We knew it was going to be tough coming to Australia, the cricket is always going to be tough.
“But that's what we can control and we need to control more of that. I'm sure you can imagine what the toughest part of the tour has been. Naturally, it's been everywhere and all that anyone has been talking about – whether it's right or wrong, true or false. It is what people have been talking about.
“But we need to just put all that to the back of our minds when we get on the pitch – go out there and try and do something special.”
At 2-0 down and with three Tests to play heading to a venue that has brought only one win in 13 matches for England – even then against an Australian side severely depleted after the exodus to Kerry Packer's controversial World Series – it does not augur particularly well for Joe Root's side.
But Bairstow is having none of it and is almost boastful in their belief that England can hit back from defeats in Brisbane and Adelaide to square the series.
“As a group, there's no way we see this series as being over,” said Bairstow. “We've lost two games, but we've been in both of them for decent periods of time. We just need to do what we've been doing for longer and do it in the key periods of the games where we've come unstuck.
“So, yes, it is frustrating, but we have a group of players who can win games here and we still have three chances to put things right.”
One reason Bairstow appears so confident that England can turn things around over the next three weeks or so lies in their faith in Yorkshire team-mate and England captain Root.
Still a relative rookie when it comes to international captaincy, the Sheffield-born batsman has impressed since taking over the reins from Alastair Cook earlier this year. Naturally, in the more intense heat of an Ashes battle. their tactics and decision-making were always going to come under a bigger spotlight in Australia.
For example, some have queried Root's decision to field first in Adelaide after winning the toss, with some critics suggesting they had handed a significant advantage to the hosts at a ground where many observers felt the conditions favoured England more.
Ultimately, Root's players were left dispirited by a second heavy defeat, the 120-run loss coming hot on the heels of a 10-wicket pounding in Brisbane. But while there may be critics outside the dressing room, Bairstow revealed that Root has the total backing of their players.
“I think Joe's captaincy has been brilliant – there aren't many things that you can fault with what he's done,” added Bairstow.
“He's still learning as a captain, but if you're captain of England you're going to be learning for a while.”

“Are you interested in trucks that grow hair on your chest?” my editor emailed me. I looked down at my barren torso and looked up again to read the subject line: “2017 Ram Power Wagon drive.” My dormant macho emotion had been stirred.
The 4×4 Power Wagon has one of the longest automotive histories in America. What originally started as a vehicle to defeat the Axis in World War II, the former Dodge Power Wagon arrived on the market in 1946 with the intention of taking its customers on incredible off-road adventures. Now 71 years and several interrupted generations later, the Ram Power Wagon continues delivering on that promise—but with considerably more power and enhanced technology.
At 149.3 inches of wheelbase, there's no doubt the Power Wagon is a big pickup. Based on the Ram 2500 HD 4×4 Crew Cab, the off-road-capable truck comes with only a 6-foot-4-inch bed yet is 237.3 inches in overall length. With 14.3 inches of ground clearance, it was difficult for this 6-foot-tall journalist to jump into the cabin without having to hoist myself up—but that's partly a consequence of the side steps having been removed.
Because the Power Wagon was built to spend most of its time off-road, Ram equipped it with a unique 2-inch lift suspension system composed of high articulation three-link front and five-link rear live axle suspension and Bilstein monotube shocks for better axle control. Added to that is an electronically disconnecting front stabilizer bar that allows the truck even more axle articulation. Although the Power Wagon was designed to conquer the great outdoors, it also has a towing capacity of 10,030 pounds and can carry a payload of 1,510 pounds.
To test Ram's latest addition, we headed to the Logandale Trails, which is about an hour outside Las Vegas. Located adjacent to the Valley of Fire, the terrain is a playground of sand dunes, rocks, and steep hills. Before getting the trucks dusty, the pressures of the 33-inch Goodyear Wrangler DuraTrac tires were knocked down to 30 psi from the on-road recommended 65 psi. Once we got the thumbs-up from our guide, Nena Barlow of Barlow Adventures, we were ready to start our off-road rumbling.
A small input on the throttle brought a quick answer from the 6.4-liter Hemi V-8. With 410 hp and 429 lb-ft of torque under the sprawling hood, our caravan was instantly spewing a dust wake. The only transmission available is a six-speed automatic. But once connected to a part-time transfer case, it allowed us to enable 4WD High for better traction on the sand. As the terrain started to change from sand to rock and the trails became narrower, the Power Wagon's width became noticeable, and we were all hitting the branches curtaining the trail.
Climbing steep hills was effortless for the Power Wagon, but descending was even easier with hill-descent control, a system that allows the drivers to control the truck's speed without touching the throttle or brake pedal. Using the buttons on the shift column, the drivers can select the descent speed, and the truck applies brake pressure to all four wheels in order to slowly guide the 7,000-pound truck down rugged terrain. The driver need only aim the steering wheel.
Being able to lock the front and rear differentials gives the Power Wagon a big advantage when rock crawling. In 4WD Low and with the anti-roll bar disconnected, we slowly climbed what seconds before seemed impassable. With an approach angle of 33.6 degrees, we avoided (barely) hitting any rocks, and the axle articulation allowed our hulking truck to crawl another 150 turbulent yards before getting to the finish line. There was zero drama. The Power Wagon makes rock crawling downright easy. A small and steady throttle input moved the truck just enough to slowly avoid obstacles; the Bilstein shocks minimized cabin movement, and the Articulink suspension gave the axle extra articulation for a better crawling performance.
Although one would only use the 12,000-pound electric winch behind the front bumper in an emergency, Barlow performed a stunt with one of their crew's Toyota 4Runners. With the Toyota sprawled on its right side and the Ram's winch hooked to the 4Runner's underbody, the Toyota was back on its four wheels in less than five minutes. Operating the winch was simple thanks to a controller that's plugged in behind the front bumper.
With such a big truck, you would expect the interior to be spacious—and it is. In fact, you can even slot a third person in the front—a middle seat acts as part of the center console when folded. Sure, whoever sits there will have trouble with legroom, but at least there's a lap belt. Our fully equipped Power Wagon came with leather seats, which were comfortable after most of the day, but you can also opt for cloth. The Power Wagon's floor is covered in hard plastic, making it easy to clean after a day in the dust.
Ram gave the Power Wagon a strong posture. Evidently, the smaller Rebel 1500's visual formula has struck a nerve with Ram's customers. And if you're a fan of the thunderous Power Wagon from the late '70s/early '80s, you can even add the Power Wagon graphics to the truck's flanks and the hood. A two-tone paint job is optional.
With pricing starting at around $53,000, the Power Wagon is hardly inexpensive. But that's typical for the truck market these days. If you add goodies to it, such as the Leather and Luxury package ($4,995), the Cargo View Camera located next to the stop lamp ($345), and the RamBox Cargo Management System ($1,295), you'll wind up close to the $60,000 mark. Our tester included even more toys than that, ringing in at $62,610.
For that price of admission, the Power Wagon resolutely keeps its promise to deliver off-roading smiles while simultaneously awakening your inner machismo.
When The Wanted's Tom Parker originally auditioned for Grease, they aren't expecting to land the role of Danny.
Speaking to us ahead of the visit to Milton Keynes Theatre from Monday August 28 to Saturday September 2, they said: “I was originally asked if I was interested in Teen Angel which meant one song and a brief role so I went for the audition.
Grease
“I got a phone call a few days later asking if I was interested in playing Danny and after an extra audition, they offered me the part which I was delighted about.”
The original high-school musical, features unforgettable songs including You're The One That I Want, Grease Is The Word and Summer Nights.
You might think that there wouldn't be too much of a challenge to go from singer to musical theatre lead but Tom says there has been difficulties.
They said: “It has been a challenge learning the script but there are a lot of transferable skills over from performing in the band. While we weren't known for lots of dancing in the band, we did a little bit.
“But when we did have some complex choreography in this show, I did go a little bit like, ah yes, I can do this.
“I did watch the film just to get the style of acting that is required in this field. John Travolta had a huge impact playing the film so I have tried to take little things from their performance but not all of it.”
Even the relatively short period of rehearsals didn't stop Tom from taking the role seriously.
They added: “We only had three weeks of rehearsals before we went out on the tour so I asked for the script a couple of months before we started the rehearsals just so I could get my head in the right place. I wanted to get into the rehearsals and nail it.
“But it is a great show and if you like the film then come along and see it.”
Tom is still best known for their role in the five-piece band The Wanted and is proud of their achievements with the band.
They said: “We played some amazing venues when we were in The Wanted and I think when I look back, my biggest memories are meeting people like Michelle Obama. A few years, I was just a lad from Bolton and then I was meeting the first lady of the United States.
“I would hope that we would reform the band, it is something that I would really push for us to do. There was something special that we had between the four of us, and we would love to recreate that experience again.”
 They are also in just a small select group of people. Tom is one of the few contestants that hasn't suffered an injury on The Jump.
Tom laughed before adding: “I was lucky to be probably one of the only people not to be injured in The Jump.
“I initially turned it down as I wasn't keen on doing television work. However after a couple of months, I regretted the decision so asked if there was a chance to do.
“All of the spaces on the show were full but they put me on the reserve list. And then the injuries happened and I ended up being on it.
“I had done some skiing but not for about 10 years before doing that show. It is quite scary doing those 30/40 foot jumps.”
But it is probably safe to say that another tour isn't top of Tom's list to do in the near future.
“I wouldn't rule out doing more musical theatre but doing a long tour does put a strain, especially as I am due to get married next year, so maybe I wouldn't do something as intense in the future.”

UNITED NATIONS - A top Pakistani diplomat has told the United Nations that Pakistan has "turned the tide" against terrorism through a series of determined actions that led to the destruction of terrorist infrastructures and bases in its Tribal Areas and along the Pak-Afghan border region.
"Terrorism in Pakistan is an unfortunate by product of the political and geo-strategic developments and foreign interventions in our neighbourhood over the past 40 years," Ambassador Maleeha Lodhi, Pakistan's permanent representative to the UN, told the UN General Assembly's Sixth Committee, which deals with legal matters.
Speaking in a debate on terrorism, Ambassador Maleeha Lodhi highlighted measures such as a dedicated counterterrorism force and an acrossthe-board military campaign, the largest anti-terrorism operation anywhere in the world, to destroy terrorist infrastructures and bases in the Pakistan-Afghanistan border region and Pakistani Tribal Areas.
Pakistan, they said, had lost over 27,000 citizens and law-enforcement personnel to this scourge, with many more injured and maimed for life as well as economic losses of over US $120 billion.
"But neither the human nor financial losses have diminished my country's commitment to fight this menace. It has only reinforced our will to fight until the last terrorist is eliminated from our soil."
Success of its counter-terrorism operations had resulted in the sharp reduction of terrorist activities across Pakistan over the past two years, they said.
Still terrorism continues to pose a challenge, but its nature has changed, they added. "The threat that we face today is primarily supported and financed from outside our borders," the Pakistani envoy pointed out.
“We are confident that we will be able to defeat these forces too, they stated.”
Maleeha Lodhi reaffirmed Pakistan's support for the OIC position on a consensusbased comprehensive convention on international terrorism.
The proposed convention must be consistent with international humanitarian law and must clearly differentiate between acts of terrorism and the legitimate struggles for selfdetermination of people living under foreign occupation, they said.
"The malicious attempts by those who seek to manipulate the international consensus against terrorism to justify the suppression of people struggling for their right to self-determination must never be permitted to succeed," they said in an obvious reference to continuing persecution of peoples in Kashmir and Palestine.
At the same time, they called for urgent and focused attention to addressing the festering disputes and unresolved conflicts, unlawful use of force, aggression, foreign occupation and denial of the right to self-determination.
"Political and economic injustice fuels animosities, breeds hostility and often also leads to violent reactions.
"Without a holistic approach, we will be fighting only the symptoms and not the underlying causes of this deadly phenomenon."
Emphasising that terrorism should not be associated with any religion, faith, race, ethnicity, value system or culture, the Pakistani envoy also called for addressing defamation of religions and demonisation of communities that provoke violent reactions.

PanARMENIAN.Net - The leader of Israeli political party Yesh Atid, Yair Lapid, has spoken out against Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, invoking the Armenian Genocide to denounce the leader of the Muslim nation, The Times of Israel reports.
Their comments came after Erdoğan vowed to use “all means to fight” against the US recognition of Jerusalem as the country's capital.
“Palestine is an innocent victim… As for Israel, it is a terrorist state, yes, terrorist!” Erdoğan said. “We will not abandon Jerusalem to the mercy of a state that kills children.”
“Those who deny the murder of children in the Armenian Genocide should not preach morality at us,” Lapid tweeted on Sunday.
Israel — along with other countries, including the United States — has refrained from formally recognizing the Armenian Genocide over fears of angering Turkey. Lapid has publicly called on Israel to recognize the targeted mass killings of 1.5 million Armenians as genocide.
CHICAGO -- Notre Dame and Wisconsin on Monday announced future games to be played at Lambeau Field in Green Bay, Wisconsin, and Chicago's Soldier Field, which will mark the first meetings between the schools since a three-game series from 1962 to 1964.
The Fighting Irish and Badgers will play Oct. 2, 2020, at Lambeau Field and Sept. 25, 2021, at Soldier Field. Ticket distribution and revenue will be split evenly.
Notre Dame has designated both games as part of its annual Shamrock Series. NBC will broadcast the 2020 game at Lambeau, and the Big Ten controls the television rights to the 2021 game in Chicago.
"These are two schools with a host of reasons to play each other," Notre Dame athletic director Jack Swarbrick said during a news conference at the Under Armour Brand House. "We will play in two iconic venues that will be a great experience for our students."
Among the connections between the schools is Wisconsin athletic director Barry Alvarez, who served as a Notre Dame assistant from 1987 to 1989 before taking the top job at Wisconsin. Green Bay Packers president Mark Murphy said Alvarez was the driving force behind the series, which took several years to finalize.
There are several Notre Dame-Packers links, including Curly Lambeau, who played briefly for the Irish before founding the Packers.
Wisconsin opened the 2016 season against LSU at Lambeau Field, which Alvarez described to ESPN as a "Packers game on steroids." The LSU-Wisconsin game marked the first major college contest at Lambeau and the first college game since Fordham and St. Norbert in 1983.
Murphy said the Packers would like to do one non-NFL event per year at Lambeau, whether it's a concert or a college game.
"The majority of our team is from the state of Wisconsin," Alvarez said. "They grew up watching the Packers and watching the Badgers. Every Sunday, they watched the Packers. ... To play a game there, the atmosphere turned into a college atmosphere, the excitement of it and just the electricity around Green Bay and in the stadium was truly special for our athletes."
Notre Dame has played 12 games at Soldier Field, most recently against Miami in 2012. The year before, Wisconsin played Northern Illinois at Soldier Field, designated as the visiting team.
The Wisconsin series gives Notre Dame at least one Big Ten opponent every season for the foreseeable future. Notre Dame faces Michigan State this season, Michigan and Northwestern in 2018, Michigan in 2019 and both Wisconsin and Purdue in 2020 and 2021.
"We want annually to have a Big Ten opponent on our schedule," Swarbrick said. "It's important to us. It's a premier conference, obviously, and we attempt to create a body of work to make a case for our inclusion in the College Football Playoff, we want to be able to have a marker, a game against the Big Ten, against the SEC. We will always have Pac-12 and ACC markers."

A North Lincolnshire woman has been nominated for an award at Parliament for taking action to protect the things we love from climate change.
Laura Carolan, from Winteringham, travelled to Parliament for the Green Heart Hero Awards ceremony on March 13.
Laura was nominated in the Best Green Heart category in recognition of their creative efforts to craft a green heart from clay to show their love for the environment.
The brooch is made from air dried clay and was made by hand to create an organic shape. Although they didn't win, they did incredibly well to reach the final three.
Green hearts are the emblem of The Climate Coalition's Show the Love campaign. With the campaign culminating on Valentine's Day, each heart represents the people, places and things you want to protect from climate change.
The awards, which range from accolades for green schools or business to sustainable sports projects, were presented by high-profile figures such as broadcaster Clive Anderson and historian Bettany Hughes as part of a campaign by The Climate Coalition.
Laura said: "'I was very surprised to be nominated for an award. I heard about the #ShowTheLove campaign from another artist and I thought it was a fantastic opportunity to combine my love for arts, crafts and the environment. It feels amazing to be recognised for my work.
"Living in a rural area next to the Humber estuary, I've witnessed the effects of our changing climate during the devastating flooding in our area in 2013. It's clear to see that it's an issue that affects each and every one of us and so I believe everyone has a responsibility to look after our planet."
The Green Heart Hero Awards are the brainchild of The Climate Coalition – a group of more than 130 organisations representing over 15 million people ranging from groups such as the Women's Institute and the Woodland Trust, trade unions such as Unison, and aid agencies such as CAFOD.
The awards were the culmination of events by The Coalition to Show The Love and celebrate the things we love which are at risk from climate change – whether sports rained off or natural beauty spots damaged by increased flooding.
Clara Goldsmith, from The Climate Coalition, said: "It's fantastic to see the work that individuals such as Laura Carolan are doing to protect the things we love from climate change.
"The people who have been nominated are just normal people who decided that they wanted to make a difference and help change the world – and they have achieved extraordinary things.
"We are really glad to have had the chance to celebrate at Parliament the great work people across the country are doing."

PONDA: Come April 1, thirty-five per cent liquor outlets in Ponda taluka will be closed down if the Supreme Court (SC) order not to renew licences of shops within 500-metre radius of the national and state highway is implemented.
Out of 789 licenced liquor outlets, the excise department has identified around 280 to be coming under the 500-metre radius and the number may rise as the departmental survey is still underway.
The 280 outlets comprise of 190 bars and restaurants and around 90 wholesale liquor shops. The excise department is likely to suffer 40 per cent revenue loss in Ponda alone, excise inspector Amol Harwalkar told this daily.
Panaji-Belgaum national highway (NH-4A) runs through many parts of Ponda and many liquor outlets have come up along the highway. NH-4A enters Ponda at Banastarim and extends up to Usgao. Liquor shops along almost 23 km stretch of the national highway will come under SC order radar.
Also the road from Farmagudi-Dhavali bypass road to Dada Vaidya Chowk in city and from Dada Vaidya Chowk till Panchwadi area through Shiroda is notified as state highway. Along the said road also, there are a large number of liquor outlets which will face closure if the SC order is implemented.
Excise inspector Amol Harwalkar said that so far the department has identified 280 liquor outlets that will be affected by the SC order and the number may rise as the departmental survey to identify liquor shops that come in 500-metre radius of national and state highway is underway.
Excise department in Ponda taluka generates most of its revenue through renewal of the licences and higher fees are paid by the outlets in city area only. With SC's order most of the outlets in city area will be affected resulting in major loss of revenue to the department.
The total expected loss will be clear after the taluka-level committee identifies all the affected parties. The committee has been formed to implement the Supreme Court order on ban on sale of liquor along the state and national highway. It comprises of excise inspector, mamlatdar, PWD engineer, member from town and country planning, talathi and panchayat secretary. The committee members will physically visit the areas and do a detailed survey of affected parties, said Harwalkar.
Santosh Tamse, the owner of a wine store situated at Curti-Haveli a stone's throw from the Panaji-Belgaum highway said that the SC order and ignorance on part of the state government has put a question mark on their source of livelihood.
President of Ponda Bar and Restaurant Owners Association Peter Fernandes said, “We are just waiting for the new government to form from which we hope to get some relief. We are hopeful that the new government will take some resolution in assembly over the ban and then challenge it in a court. We have received positive response from the state government. If the government fails to help us, then coming on the roads will be the last alternative.”
