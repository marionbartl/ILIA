Inglesby, otherwise known as the Francis House, was located in South Yarra, Melbourne, Australia. It was designed by local architect Harold Desbrowe-Annear and completed in 1915.
The house was designed for the Francis family, who emigrated from England in the late 19th century. The house was named Inglesby after the family estate in England of the same name. Inglesby was at the forefront of modernism in Australia, by using open-planning and enabling views across the entire house due to few interior walls. Desbrowe-Annear also introduced the ability to open up spaces to combine rooms, or to close them off to create multiple separate spaces. Furthermore, the use of plain white walls, a simple rectangular footprint, and reduced ornamentation also constituted the modernist style through the creation of pure and ordered form. The house was demolished in 1964 and a set of apartment blocks have been erected, which hold references to the Francis House through materiality and retaining the name Inglesby.
Description
Inglesby was a white, two-storey rectangular building influenced by the Californian style architecture of the time, with a large garden buffering the house from the street. The building was structurally supported with a simple timber frame clad with white roughcast blocks. In terms of roofing, Desbrowe-Annear hinted at modernism by using a slightly pitched a tiled roof, but ensuring the roof appeared flat from the street. Moreover, each window incorporated small wooden eyelash like brackets, communicated with the wooden pergola, which divided the front garden. This use of exposed wood aimed to accentuate the importance of use of Australian timber and materials.
The porch in front of the building is a key feature of the house. This square enclosed space was a direct translation of Irving Gill's style of modernism, through the use of uncomplicated openings, symmetry and simplicity. The porch dominated the façade and was a pioneering feature in contemporary Australian architecture due to the simplicity, elegance and proportionality of its white walls. Through Inglesby, Desbrowe-Annear began to question the role of ornamentation, proving that a simple shape can be just as bold and eye catching.
The porch led into a hallway which divided the building and acted as a central spine and provided internal axial circulation and contained a wooden staircase which provided access to the bedrooms and bathrooms. The living space consisted of a dining and living room opening off the hall. Sliding doors allowed this space to be split into two separate rooms or opened into one large space which inhabited the entire front of the house. There were few interior walls in the Francis house, which incorporated the idea of open-plan living. Furthermore, Inglesby had low ceilings with wide hallways and rooms, which emphasised the feeling of spaciousness and width, as each space sprawled across the wooden floors. Desbrowe-Annear also introduced the idea of built-in furniture and robes to Australian architecture. This meant less furniture was needed, removing clutter from the room and emphasising the extensive open spaces.
Influences
Irving J. Gill
The design of Inglesby arrived through the influence of American architect Irving Gill's forms. Irving J. Gill's design concepts were centred on the attributes of simplicity, honesty and democracy. Many of Gill's projects were in Southern California and were minimalist in terms of ornamentation and form. They were often simple boxes in plan, characterised by flat or low pitched roofs. Their entrances were commonly placed at the end of a long pergola or an extended arcade. Spaces were also designed with the intention of dual or multiple functions. A primary example of this style is the Lewis Court Cottage, which had a large scale pergola acting as an entrance, living-dining room and outdoor porch. To tie everything together, a garden surrounded the porch and entrance, providing the formalities of a front yard.
M.H. Baillie Scott
Desbrowe-Annear took inspiration from the designs of English architect M.H. Baillie Scott. Baillie Scott was known for his residential designs, which incorporated the idea of open planning with a large living area being the heart of the house in terms of location and spatial volume. It served multiple functions of living and dining with access to the office, workroom and lavatory as well. All of these rooms were usually linked through large sliding doors, allowing each space to be opened or closed off.
Baillie Scott states.
“In making the plan for a house it will be necessary to banish from one's mind the conception of its interior as a mere group of isolated compartments, and to think of it rather as a central room surrounded by subordinated ones, some of which may in many cases form either recesses in the central apartment or communicate with it either by folding or sliding doors.”

The Kora, Khora or Cora were one of the ten indigenous tribes of the Great Andamanese people, originally living on the eastern part of North Andaman Island in the Indian Ocean. The tribe is now extinct, although some of the remaining Great Andamanese on Strait Island claim to have Kora ancestors.
The tribe spoke a distinctive Kora language, closely related to the other Great Andamanese languages. The native name for the language was Aka-Kora, also spelled Aka-Khora or Aka-Cora (Aka- being a prefix for "tongue"); and this name is often used for the tribe itself. They were divided between shore-dwellers (aryoto) and forest-dwellers (eremtaga) subtribes.
History
By the time of the first permanent British settlement at Port Blair (1858), the estimated size of the Kora tribe was about 500 individuals, out of perhaps 3500 Great Andamanese.
However the tribe was discovered only much later, in the work leading to the 1901 census. Like other Andamanese peoples, the Kora were decimated during colonial and post-colonial times, by diseases, alcohol, colonial warfare and loss of territory. The census of 1901 recorded 96 individuals, which decreased to 71 in 1911, 48 in 1921, and 24 in 1931.
In 1949, any remaining Kora were relocated, with all other surviving Great Andamanese, to a reservation on Bluff island. In 1969 they were relocated again to a reservation on Strait Island.
By 1980 only one person claimed to be a Kora member, and 1994 the Kora tribe no longer existed as a separate unit. Although descendants of the Kora were still living in the Great Andamanese reservation of Strait Island as of 2006, they identified themselves as members of other tribes, mainly Jeru. The last known speaker of the Kora language died in November 2009. They were a designated Scheduled Tribe.

The Matabeleland Tuskers is one of five Zimbabwean cricket franchises. They are a first-class cricket team, based in the Bulawayo Metropolitan and Matabeleland North area. They play their home matches at Queens Sports Club in Bulawayo. They were formed in 2009, when the domestic game in Zimbabwean cricket was restructured.
History
In their first season, they suffered disappointing results, placing fourth in the Logan Cup, and failing to qualify for the final of either the one-day or Twenty20 competitions. The following season, they qualified for the final of the Logan Cup as league runners-up, and despite missing their best four batsmen in the final, defeated the Mountaineers by 18 runs to claim their first title. They defended their title the following year, winning five of their eight matches to clinch consecutive wins in the Logan Cup: the first team in the franchise-era to achieve the feat.
They won the 2016–17 Pro50 Championship, the domestic List A tournament.

The Companies Act 1929 (19 & 20 Geo.5 c.23) was an Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom, which regulated UK company law. Its descendant is the Companies Act 2006.
Provisions
Forms made under the 1929 Act introduced the term "Companies Court", referring to the High Court, Chancery Division, when exercising its jurisdiction for company law matters (Re Tasbian Ltd (No 2) [1990] BCC 322, 324).
s 77(1) authorised the court in a compulsory winding up to direct the liquidator either to prosecute the offender himself or to refer the matter to the Director of Public Prosecutions. If it appeared to the liquidator in a voluntary winding up that any past or present director, manager or other officer of the company had been guilty of an offence in relation to the company for which he was criminally liable, section 77(2) required him to report the matter to the Director of Public Prosecutions. It also required the liquidator to give the Director of Public Prosecutions information and access to documents in his possession or under his control. If the Director of Public Prosecutions decided not to bring proceedings against the offender, the liquidator could do so himself though only with the leave of the court. This was a safeguard against the company's assets being wasted on frivolous or vexatious proceedings.
Repeal
This Act was repealed by section 459 of, and the seventeenth schedule to, the Companies Act 1948.

Idaho County is a county in the U.S. state of Idaho, and the largest by area in the state. As of the 2020 census, the population was 16,541. The county seat is Grangeville. Previous county seats of the area were Florence (1864–68), Washington (1868–75), and Mount Idaho (1875–1902).
History
Idaho County's oldest non-native settlements are ghost towns. Discovery of gold occurred in succession at Elk City, Newsome, and Florence during the spring and summer of 1861. At the time, all of the settlements were within Shoshone County, Washington Territory. Thousands flocked to Florence. As a result, Idaho County was founded as a region of Washington Territory in 1861, named for a steamer called Idaho that was launched on the Columbia River in 1860. It was reorganized by the Idaho Territorial Legislature on February 4, 1864. In this context, the Idaho Territory and the State of Idaho are both preceded by the county name.
Settlements at Cottonwood, Mount Idaho, and Warrens were established in 1862. The Warrens settlement was a fractured settlement as a result of settlement there by both Union and Confederate affiliated miners. The Union affiliated miners on the northern edge of the settlement named their portion of the settlement Washington while the Confederate affiliated miners named their portion Richmond. Richmond dwindled by 1866 and Washington went on to become the county seat in 1868 and was the name of the settlement used in most government documents during the period of settlement. Out of all these settlements, only Cottonwood went on to eventually become one of Idaho County's seven incorporated cities.
Idaho Territory conducted a census in 1863 and another in 1864. Population data was returned for both years for Warrens (660/521), Florence (575/254), Elk City (372/219), Slate Creek (216/117), Clearwater Station (212/76), and Newsome (62/24). For 1864, data was also returned for the settlements of Mount Idaho (74), Miller's Camp (36), and Cottonwood (17). Between 1863 and 1864, Idaho County saw a decrease from 1,601 residents to 955.
Settlement at White Bird occurred some time prior to 1870 as a precinct under the same name is listed with 71 inhabitants at the 1870 census. Efforts to force White Bird's band of Nez Perce tribesmen to the Nez Perce Reservation led to the Battle of White Bird Canyon in 1877. The town was established in 1891.
Grangeville emerged as a town at the 1880 census with 129 residents. It was incorporated as a city in 1904. Ferdinand and Kooskia were settled starting in 1895 and along with Cottonwood and Stites, were all incorporated prior to 1920. Development of Riggins started prior to 1930 with Riggins Village being incorporated in 1948.
Idaho County's boundaries have changed more times than any other Idaho's county with changes occurring on 20 separate dates over the county's first 57 years. The majority of those changes were from boundary realignment with only three counties taking territory from Idaho County at their creation. Originating at 75,789 square miles, its original boundary under Washington Territory contained the southern portion of Idaho County, Idaho's 34 southern counties, part of Ravalli County, Montana, and parts of Fremont, Lincoln, Park, Sublette, and Teton counties in Wyoming. Boise was partitioned off in January 1863 with the Payette River being the primary dividing line. In 1864, two separate acts transferred the portion in Montana to Missoula County, established the southern boundary at 44° 30' latitude, and made slight adjustments in the northern boundary to define the county as one of Idaho Territory's seven original counties. Three boundary adjustments were made with Nez Perce and Ada between 1866 and 1867 and Lemhi was created in 1869 from territory east of the junction of the Middle Fork and main Salmon Rivers. In 1873, the southern border was moved north to the divide between the main Salmon River with the Payette River and Middle Fork of Salmon River, bringing the county to its smallest historical land area of 2,901 square miles. The boundary adjustment of 1875 created a county very similar to present Idaho County containing an area of 8,165 square miles. Between 1879 and 1885, one change added territory on the Camas Prairie from Nez Perce while another brought back territory in present-day Adams, Valley, Custer, and Lemhi counties in the south. In 1887, territory was exchanged with Boise County dividing present Valley County between the two counties. One change in 1889 transferred territory to Custer County while another change finalized the county's northern border at its present location. The southern border began to take shape after two changes in 1891 and 1895 exchanged territory between Washington and Idaho counties. Adjustments with Lemhi in 1903 and 1911 and the creation of Valley County in 1918 brought the county to its present boundary.
Idaho County is one of seven counties in the United States that has the same name as the state in which it lies. The other six are Arkansas, Hawaii, Iowa, New York, Oklahoma, and Utah.
Geography

The 710th Infantry Division () was a German Army infantry division in World War II. Formed in May 1941, it spent the majority of the war in occupation duties in Scandinavia before being transferred to the Italian Front in late 1944. It participated in fighting against the Soviet Union in Hungary before it withdrew into Austria and surrendered to the Americans in May 1945.
History
The 710th Infantry Division was formed on 2 May 1941, largely from older personnel, under the command of Generalleutnant Theodor Petsch. It was smaller than a conventional infantry division and lacked much of the support weaponry that would typically be found in such a unit. The division served occupation duties in Norway, firstly at Oslo and then at Kristiansand. It later performed similar duties in Denmark until December 1944, at which stage it was transferred to the Italian Front. The following month it was attached to I SS Panzer Corps, which had moved to Hungary after the Battle of the Bulge.
The division, expanded with additional artillery and tank destroyer units, was involved in the fighting against Soviet troops during Operation Spring Awakening and the subsequent withdrawal through Hungary and into Austria. Now under the command of Generalmajor Walter Gorn, it surrendered to a United States Army unit on 8 May 1945.

Agnès Bernet, (born 1968) is a French cell biologist and professor of cancer biology at the University Claude Bernard Lyon I. A co-founder of NETRIS Pharma, she has led within the Laboratory of Apoptosis, Cancer and Development, the research team that validated the use of interference ligand/dependence receptors as novel targeted therapies for cancer.
Life and work
Bernet earned her PhD at University Claude Bernard Lyon I in 1994 with the thesis Etude, par recombinaison homologue, de régions régulatrices de l'expression des gènes de globine alpha humains (Study, by homologous recombination, of regulatory regions of the expression of human alpha globin genes). Her research focused on the study of two regions that may be involved in the activation of human alpha globin genes during erythroid differentiation.
In 2008, she co-founded the company Netris Pharma SAS, where she serves as scientific director and coordinates numerous research projects concerning clinical therapies relating to cancer. In particular, her work on Netrin-1, the antibody developed by her team, is an antitumor product that has been tested in humans in clinical trials at the Center Léon Bérard.
Her work has focused on a new therapeutic target, dependence receptors. These are pairs of receptors/ligands which are deregulated in cancers. The first prototype therapeutic molecule was an antibody against the ligand Netrin-1, overexpressed in many types of cancer. This antibody causes the death of tumor cells.
Bernet was named a junior member of the Institut Universitaire de France in 2008, which was a five-year appointment. In 2015, she received the Irène Joliot-Curie Prize in the Women and Business category for her work in both teaching and researching cancer therapies.

Williamson County is a county in Southern Illinois. At the 2020 census, it had a population of 67,153. The largest city and county seat is Marion.
Williamson County is included in the Carbondale-Marion, IL Metropolitan Statistical Area. This area of Southern Illinois is known locally as "Little Egypt".
Williamson is in the Metro Lakeland area, southeast of St. Louis, Missouri. Via the nearby intersection of Interstates 57 and 24, and Illinois Route 13, a primary east–west four-lane expressway, the city has access to the major communities of Murphysboro, Carbondale, Carterville, Herrin, Marion and Harrisburg.
The Metro Lakeland area of Jackson-Williamson counties has a total of 120,000 residents. Carbondale (14 miles west), Herrin and Marion are the key urban areas in Metro Lakeland, with a combined population of more than 65,000. Over 235,000 people live within .
History
Williamson County was formed from Franklin County on February 28, 1839, and was named for Williamson County, Tennessee. Many of its settlers were from the Uplands South, traveling via the Ohio River from Kentucky and Virginia.
It became a center of coal mining, attracting numerous European immigrants in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Labor tensions rose as workers sought to unionize and improve their wages and conditions. Mine owners resisted and several episodes of violence resulted during strikes and other work actions. resulted in several episodes of violence. Williamson County is often referred to as "Bloody Williamson," due to several outbreaks of violence that have few parallels in American history.
These include the Bloody Vendetta (1876), armed confrontation between families and associates during the waning days of Reconstruction; the Carterville Massacre (1899), a Coal Strike (1906), the Herrin Massacre (1922), the Klan War (1924–1926), and the Birger/Shelton Gang War (1926).
During the so-called Klan War, a mob of perhaps 1,300 men were deputized by the local sheriff. Starting on 1 February 1924, the posse began raiding the homes of local mine workers, mostly Italian immigrants. The Klan was inspired by both nativist and Prohibitionist fervor. Violence continued sporadically between bootleggers and the Klan. Twenty people were killed before peace was restored.
In June 1915, a Sicilian miner accused of the fatal shooting of a wealthy local resident was lynched in Johnston City, Illinois by a mob. The Illinois National Guard was deployed to prevent rioting between the miner's supporters and opponents. They were also later ordered to various locations repeatedly during the 1920s to separate warring parties and attempt to keep order.
The northwest section of the county suffered extensive damage during the Tri-State Tornado of 1925. The county was also struck by two tornadoes on May 29, 1982, which killed 10 people in the Marion, Illinois tornado outbreak. On May 8, 2009, the cities of Carterville, Herrin, and Marion were severely damaged by the May 2009 Southern Midwest derecho.

United States Penitentiary, Marion is located in Southern Precinct in Williamson County.
Politics
Williamson County has been solidly Republican on the national level, voting for the Republican candidates for U.S. president since 2000.
Climate and weather
Williamson County lies on the border between humid continental climate (Köppen climate classification Dfa) and humid subtropical climate (Köppen climate classification Cfa), with neither large mountains nor large bodies of water to moderate its temperature. It is subject to both cold Arctic air and hot, humid tropical air from the Gulf of Mexico and, along with the rest of the midwestern United States, is home to some of the largest temperature extremes in the world.
The region has four distinct seasons. Spring is the wettest season and produces erratic severe weather ranging from tornadoes to winter storms. Summers are hot and humid, with only occasional and brief respite, and the humidity often makes the heat index rise to temperatures feeling well above . Fall is mild with lower humidity and can produce intermittent bouts of heavy rainfall, with the first snow flurries usually forming in late November. Winters are cold with periodic snow and temperatures often below freezing; however, thaws are usually frequent. Winter storm systems, such as Alberta clippers and Panhandle hooks, can bring days of heavy freezing rain, ice pellets, and snowfall.
The normal high temperature in July is 90 °F (32 °C), and the normal low temperature in January is 19 °F (−6 °C), although this varies from year to year. Both and temperatures can be seen on an average 2 or 3 days per year. In recent years, average temperatures have ranged from a low of in January to a high of in July, although a record low of was recorded in January 1977 and a record high of was recorded in August 1977. Average monthly precipitation ranged from in October to in May.
Williamson County has thunderstorms about 50 days a year on average. Thunderstorms contribute over half of the annual precipitation. Especially in the spring, these storms can often be severe, with high winds, large hail and tornadoes.
Some late autumns feature the warm weather known as Indian summer; some years see roses in bloom as late as early December.

The Meyers MAC-125 is a light sport aircraft developed in the United States in 1947, produced in a small series as the MAC-145.
Design and development
The basic design, common to both models, was that of a low-wing cantilever monoplane of all-metal construction with side-by-side seating for two in a fully enclosed cabin. The main gear wheels of the undercarriage were retractable, and the tailwheel was steerable. The aircraft structure incorporated a framework built up of welded steel tube which extended lengthwise from the engine firewall to the rear of the cabin, and spanwise from one undercarriage well to the other. Around this framework was a conventional, monocoque fuselage. The MAC-125 was powered by a single 125-hp engine while the MAC-145 production model had a 145-hp engine instead and a larger tail fin.
The first prototype was lost during spin testing for certification while being flown by Al Meyers. Meyers parachuted to safety, sustaining a broken ankle, and although the aircraft was destroyed, its steel inner structure was salvaged and used to build the second prototype. Certification was subsequently successfully achieved with this aircraft.
Production and operations
Only twenty MAC-145s were built, each to a specific customer order, a business strategy that insulated the Meyers company from the poor market conditions that bankrupted many small American aircraft manufacturers in the late 1940s. Production continued until 1955 when the larger, 4-seat Meyers 200 was certified and began production. The Meyers Aircraft Company was acquired by the Aero Commander division of Rockwell International in 1965. The type was never produced by Rockwell, and the design again changed hands as part of the Meyers package when sold to Interceptor Corporation in 1968 and subsequently to Prop-Jets Inc in 1982.
The MAC-145 type certificate was subsequently acquired by the Seminole Tribe of Florida, who flew a highly modified version of the design in 1997 as the Micco SP-20.
Examples of Meyers-built MAC-145s are still active in 2011.

The Anglican Diocese of Bunbury is a diocese of the Anglican Church of Australia which was founded in 1904 and covers the south of the State of Western Australia. Together with Perth and North West Australia, it is one of the three diocese of the Province of Western Australia. The diocese's cathedral since 1963 is St Boniface's Cathedral in Bunbury. The current Bishop of Bunbury, since 3 November 2018, is Ian Coutts.
Cathedral
The cathedral church of the dioceses is Saint Boniface Cathedral in Bunbury. The cathedral is of brick construction in a modernist style with a prominent clock tower at the east end crowning the sanctuary. The foundation stone was laid in 1961 and the cathedral was consecrated on 14 October 1962. Prior to 1962, the diocese was based at St Paul's Pro-Cathedral, which was constructed in 1866 on the site of an earlier church. St Paul's, previously only a parish church, had been named a pro-cathedral in 1903 in preparation for Bunbury gaining diocesan status the following year. It was demolished in 1963.

You are the twenty-second studio album by American singer Aretha Franklin, released on October 16, 1975, by Atlantic Records.
Background
It was a commercial disappointment, stalling at #83 on Billboards album chart. The album's only pop chart single, "Mr. D.J." peaked at #53 on Billboard'''s Hot 100, while climbing to only #13 R&B. The title track, issued as the follow-up, reached #15 R&B. The album brought an end to Aretha's long collaboration with the Atlantic producer Jerry Wexler.
Critical receptionThe Guardian'' named "Mr. D.J. (5 for the D.J.)" one of Franklin's "30 Greatest Songs", and called it "a horn and call-and-response vocal-laden strut that defies anyone in earshot not to dance."

Basler Sportclub Old Boys, commonly known as BSC Old Boys, Old Boys Basel or simply Old Boys or when written just OB, is a Swiss sports club based in Basel. The club is mainly known for its football but it also has track, swimming and tennis sections. The association's colors are yellow and black.
History
In 1876 the gymnastics teacher at the then secondary school, Adolf Glaz, founded the RTV/Realschüler-Turnverein (secondary school student gymnastics club). In 1893 he introduced his students to the new football game. From then some members of the club met regularly during the summer and autumn holidays and the RTV had a football team. When the students finished school, they could no longer be members of the student association. That is why they founded their own football club in 1894. Since they founded the club because they had become too old for the school club, they called the new club the "Old Boys".
Although the first national championship in Switzerland took place in 1897–98 it is considered as unofficial because it was not organized by the Swiss Football Association (SFA; founded in 1895 with OB as founder member). OB did not participate in this first championship, but did in the second edition during the following season.
The first edition of the official Swiss championship was played in the 1898–99 season as a knock out competition, divided into three regional groups, an east (region Zürich), a central (regional north-west Switzerland) and west group (Romandy). The winners of each group played the finals in a round-robin tournament. OB played against FC Basel in the central group semi-final, at the Landhof on 13 November 1898 and drew 1–1 with their local rivals. It therefore required a replay. This was also drawn, despite an agreed two times 20 minutes extra time. Because OB complained that the first FCB goal had been scored by hand, they protested and the SFA had to deal with the matter. Subsequently, the protest was approved and awarded - and the disputed goal was simply deducted from the score to give the final result. Thus OB became the first forfait winners in Swiss football history. OB advanced to the finals, but the Anglo-American Club Zürich became Swiss champions.
The Swiss Serie A season 1903–04 was again divided into three regional groups, east, central and west. OB were allocated to the central group together with the Young Boys, FC Bern, Floria Biel/Bienne, and two further teams from Basel FC Basel and Fortuna Basel. The Young Boys and the Old Boys ended level on points and so a play-off match was arranged. The OB won the play-off 3–2 and therefore qualified for the finals. In the finals St. Gallen first drew 1–1 against group west winners Servette, then they won 1–0 against central group winners OB and because the OB beat Servette 2–0, St. Gallen won their first ever championship title.
The Swiss Serie A 1912–13 was also divided into three regional groups as before. OB were allocated to the central group together with local rivals FC Basel and Nordstern Basel. The other teams playing in this group were Young Boys, FC La Chaux-de-Fonds, Étoile-Sporting FC La Chaux-de-Fonds, FC Bern and Biel-Bienne. One point ahead of Young Boys, OB became group winners and advanced to the finals. Lausanne Sports won the championship and OB were again runners-up.
The club was founded as FC Old Boys Basel but became BSC Old Boys at the beginning of the 20th century. As explained in 1899, 1904 and 1913, the club finished as runners-up in the Swiss Series A, but in 1932, the club was relegated from the professional leagues. After spending many years in the amateur leagues, OB managed to climb back into the Nationalliga B in 1987, the same year that local rivals FC Basel were relegated from the Nationalliga A, meaning the two clubs would meet again. In the 1995/96 season, Old Boys were relegated again from the professional divisions to the amateurs and they now play in the Second Group of Swiss 1. Liga.
BSC Old Boys play at the Stadium Schützenmatte, but the original home ground of the club was Margaret Meadow. The club had to move stadium because the IWB, the Industrial Works of Basel, bought the grounds and developed their head-quarters there.
In 1922, a swimming section was founded, which later merged with other clubs, and in 1927, a tennis club was founded. In 1935, it split to become Tennis Club Old Boys, today's home club of Roger Federer.

Tigerfish can refer to fish from various families, and derives from official and colloquial associations of these with the tiger (Panthera tigris). However, the primary species designated by the name "tigerfish" are African and belong to the family Alestidae.
African tigerfish
Several species belonging to the genus Hydrocynus of the family Alestidae are referred to as "tigerfish", and are particularly prized as game fish. These African fish are found in many rivers and lakes on the continent and are fierce predators with distinctive, proportionally large teeth.
The goliath tigerfish (Hydrocynus goliath) is among the most famous tigerfish. The largest one on record is said to have weighed . It is found in the Congo River system and Lake Tanganyika and is the largest member of the family Alestidae. Another famous species, simply called the tigerfish (Hydrocynus vittatus), is commonly found in the southernly Okavango Delta, and the Zambezi River, and also in the two biggest lakes along the Zambezi, Lake Kariba which borders Zimbabwe and Zambia, Kabombo River in Zambia and Cabora Bassa in Mozambique, and finally in the Jozini dam in South Africa. Both the goliath tigerfish and its smaller relative the tigerfish are found in Africa.
Behavior
In the western gamefishing world, Hydrocynus vittatus is considered Africa's equivalent of the South American piranha, though it belongs to a completely different zoological family. Like the piranha, individual tigerfish have interlocking, razor-sharp teeth, along with streamlined, muscular bodies, and are extremely aggressive and capable predators who often hunt in groups.
The African tigerfish is the first freshwater fish recorded and confirmed to attack and catch birds in flight.
Cichlids
The name "tigerfish" has occasionally been used for a species of cichlid in the genus Rhamphochromis. The species is large, silver-coloured, and individuals typically have one or more black lines running the length of either flank. These fish are native to Lake Malawi in Africa. Like the other African tigerfish species, they are famed for possessing large, prominent teeth, and they are known to attack humans.
Datnioididae
Several species of Coius (or Datnioides, depending on the taxonomic authority) have been referred to as "tigerfish", particularly in fishkeeping books and magazines. They are large, wide-bodied fish whose flanks are covered by vivid black stripes.
Erythrinidae
The large South American characins of the family Erythrinidae have also sometimes been called "tigerfish".

Martha Dilys Buckley-Jones is a former Canadian diplomat. She was appointed Chargé d'Affaires a.i. to Guatemala then as High Commissioner to Trinidad and Tobago then concurrently to Zambia and Malawi.
Her work in multiple countries has been cited in the news. In the late 1960s, while Buckley-Jones worked at the Canadian embassy in Lima, Peru, her work centered on providing visas and information for the Canadian citizens living in Peru. In 1984, The Globe and Mail noted she was called "a tower of strength in Canada's External Affairs Department" as she helped Canadians leave Nicaragua during political crisis in Latin America. In 1985, Buckley-Jones worked at the embassy in Lebanon when the staff of the Canadian embassy moved from Lebanon to Beirut due to safety concerns, and discussed the presence of Canadian citizens in Iran during the 1985 departure of foreigners from Iran. She also discussed Canada's support of the United States and Great Britain in interactions with the Soviet Union, and smooths diplomatic incidents such as Jim Karygiannis's issues when he visited Trinidad in 1991. In 1990, Buckley-Jones was named as official at the rank of ambassador to Guatemala, which was controversial given the human rights abuses in Guatemala. In her work in the Canadian External Affairs department, Buckley-Jones is widely cited, including discussions on recovery of hostages from southern Sudan, issues surrounding the appointment of Bryce Mackasey as ambassador to Portugal, and relations between Canada and the Vatican the United States and Mexico.
She has provided advice for Canadians traveling overseas, and worked to help Canadians encountering legal difficulties while they are overseas.

Orthorexia nervosa (also known as orthorexia) (ON) is a proposed eating disorder characterized by an excessive preoccupation with eating healthy food. The term was introduced in 1997 by American physician Steven Bratman, M.D. He suggested that some people's dietary restrictions intended to promote health may paradoxically lead to unhealthy consequences, such as social isolation, anxiety, loss of ability to eat in a natural, intuitive manner, reduced interest in the full range of other healthy human activities, and, in rare cases, severe malnutrition or even death.
In 2009, Ursula Philpot, chair of the British Dietetic Association and senior lecturer at Leeds Metropolitan University, described people with orthorexia nervosa as being "solely concerned with the quality of the food they put in their bodies, refining and restricting their diets according to their personal understanding of which foods are truly 'pure'." This differs from other eating disorders, such as anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa, where those affected focus on the quantity of food eaten.
Orthorexia nervosa also differs from anorexia nervosa in that it does not disproportionally affect one gender. Studies have found that orthorexia nervosa is equally found in both men and women with no significant gender differences at all. Furthermore, research has found significant positive correlations between ON and both narcissism and perfectionism, but no significant correlation between ON and self esteem. This shows that high-ON individuals likely take pride over their healthy eating habits over others and that is the driving force behind their orthorexia as opposed to body image like anorexia.
Orthorexia nervosa is not recognized as an eating disorder by the American Psychiatric Association, and so is not mentioned as an official diagnosis in the widely used Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM).
Signs and symptoms
Symptoms of orthorexia nervosa include "obsessive focus on food choice, planning, purchase, preparation, and consumption; food regarded primarily as source of health rather than pleasure; distress or disgust when in proximity to prohibited foods; exaggerated faith that inclusion or elimination of particular kinds of food can prevent or cure disease or affect daily well-being; periodic shifts in dietary beliefs while other processes persist unchanged; moral judgment of others based on dietary choices; body image distortion around sense of physical "impurity" rather than weight; persistent belief that dietary practices are health-promoting despite evidence of malnutrition."
Cause
There has been no investigation into whether there may be a biological cause specific to orthorexia nervosa. It may be a food-centered manifestation of obsessive-compulsive disorder, which has a lot to do with control.
Diagnosis
In 2016, formal criteria for orthorexia were proposed in the peer-reviewed journal Eating Behaviors by Thom Dunn and Steven Bratman. These criteria are as follows:
Criterion A. Obsessive focus on "healthy" eating, as defined by a dietary theory or set of beliefs whose specific details may vary; marked by exaggerated emotional distress in relationship to food choices perceived as unhealthy; weight loss may ensue, but this is conceptualized as an aspect of ideal health rather than as the primary goal. As evidenced by the following:
Compulsive behavior and/or mental preoccupation regarding affirmative and restrictive dietary practices believed by the individual to promote optimum health. (Footnotes to these criteria add: Dietary practices may include use of concentrated "food supplements." Exercise performance and/or fit body image may be regarded as an aspect or indicator of health.)
Violation of self-imposed dietary rules causes exaggerated fear of disease, sense of personal impurity and/or negative physical sensations, accompanied by anxiety and shame.
Dietary restrictions escalate over time, and may come to include elimination of entire food groups and involve progressively more frequent and/or severe "cleanses" (partial fasts) regarded as purifying or detoxifying. This escalation commonly leads to weight loss, but the desire to lose weight is absent, hidden or subordinated to ideation about healthy food.
Criterion B. The compulsive behavior and mental preoccupation becomes clinically impairing by any of the following:
Malnutrition, severe weight loss or other medical complications from restricted diet
Intrapersonal distress or impairment of social, academic or vocational functioning secondary to beliefs or behaviors about healthy diet
Positive body image, self-worth, identity and/or satisfaction excessively dependent on compliance with self-defined "healthy" eating behavior.
A diagnostic questionnaire has been developed for orthorexia sufferers, similar to questionnaires for other eating disorders, named the ORTO-15. However, Dunn and Bratman critique this survey tool as lacking appropriate internal and external validation.
Epidemiology
Results across scientific findings have yet to find a definitive conclusion to support whether nutrition students and professionals are at higher risk than other population subgroups, due to differing results in the research literature. There are only a few notable scientific works that, in an attempt to explore the breadth and depth of the still vaguely-understood illness, have tried to identify which groups in society are most vulnerable to its onset. This includes a 2008 German study, which based its research on the widespread suspicion that the most nutritionally-informed, such as university nutrition students, are a potential high-risk group for eating disorders, due to a substantial accumulation of knowledge on food and its relationship to health; the idea being that the more one knows about health, the more likely an unhealthy fixation about being healthy can develop. This study also inferred that orthorexic tendencies may even fuel a desire to study the science, indicating that many within this field might suffer from the disorder before commencing the course. However the results found that the students in the study, upon initial embarkation of their degree, did not have higher orthorexic values than other non-nutrition university students, and thus the report concluded that further research is needed to clarify the relationship between food-education and the onset of ON.
Similarly, in a Portuguese study on nutrition tertiary students, the participants' orthorexic scores (according to the ORTO-15 diagnostic questionnaire) actually decreased as they progressed through their course, as well as the overall risk of developing an eating disorder being an insignificant 4.2 percent. The participants also answered questionnaires to provide insight into their eating behaviours and attitudes, and despite this study finding that nutrition and health-science students tend to have more restrictive eating behaviours, these studies however found no evidence to support that these students have "more disturbed or disordered eating patterns than other students" These two aforementioned studies conclude that the more understanding of food one has is not necessarily a risk factor for ON, explaining that the data gathered suggests dietetics professionals are not at significant risk of it.
However, these epidemiologic studies have been critiqued as using a fundamentally flawed survey tool that inflates prevalence rates. Scholars have questioned both the reliability and validity of the ORTO-15.
Most scientific findings tend to agree, however, young adults and adolescents are extremely susceptible to developing eating disorders. One study found that there was no relationship between BOT score and college major, which may indicate the prevalence of mental health issues and eating disorders on college campuses and that health and science majors are no longer the only ones affected More studies have also been conducted on the link between increased Instagram use and Orthorexia nervosa. The social media based healthy community has recently grown in popularity especially on platforms such as Instagram. The hashtag #food is one of the top 25 most popular hashtags on Instagram. A study that investigated this relationship found that increased use of Instagram correlated between symptoms of ON with no other social media platform having the same effect. With young adults and adolescents making up the majority of social media users, exposure to this type of content can lead to developing unhealthy behavior.
History
In a 1997 article in the magazine Yoga Journal, the American physician Steven Bratman coined the term "orthorexia nervosa" from the Greek ορθο- (ortho, "right" or "correct"), and όρεξις (orexis, "appetite"), literally meaning 'correct appetite', but in practice meaning 'correct diet'. The term is modeled on anorexia, literally meaning "without appetite", as used in the definition of the condition anorexia nervosa. (In both terms, "nervosa" indicates an unhealthy psychological state.) Bratman described orthorexia as an unhealthy fixation with what the individual considers to be healthy eating. Beliefs about what constitutes healthy eating commonly originate in one or another dietary theory such as raw foods veganism or macrobiotics, but are then taken to extremes, leading to disordered eating patterns and psychological and/or physical impairment. Bratman based this proposed condition on his personal experiences in the 1970s, as well as behaviors he observed among his patients in the 1990s. In 2000, Bratman, with David Knight, authored the book Health Food Junkies, which further expanded on the subject.
Following the publication of the book, in 2004 a team of Italian researchers from La Sapienza University of Rome, published the first empirical study attempting to develop a tool to measure the prevalence of orthorexia, known as the ORTO-15.
In 2015, responding to news articles in which the term orthorexia is applied to people who merely follow a non-mainstream theory of healthy eating, Bratman specified the following: "A theory may be conventional or unconventional, extreme or lax, sensible or totally wacky, but, regardless of the details, followers of the theory do not necessarily have orthorexia. They are simply adherents of a dietary theory. The term 'orthorexia' only applies when an eating disorder develops around that theory." Bratman elsewhere clarifies that with a few exceptions, most common theories of healthy eating are followed safely by the majority of their adherents; however, "for some people, going down the path of a restrictive diet in search of health may escalate into dietary perfectionism." Karin Kratina, PhD, writing for the National Eating Disorders Association, summarizes this process as follows: "Eventually food choices become so restrictive, in both variety and calories, that health suffers – an ironic twist for a person so completely dedicated to healthy eating."
Although orthorexia is not recognized as a mental disorder by the American Psychiatric Association, and it is not listed in the DSM-5, as of January 2016, four case reports and more than 40 other articles on the subject have been published in a variety of peer-reviewed journals internationally. According to a study published in 2011, two-thirds of a sample of 111 Dutch-speaking eating disorder specialists felt they had observed the syndrome in their clinical practice.
According to the Macmillan English Dictionary, the word is entering the English lexicon. The concept of orthorexia as a newly developing eating disorder has attracted significant media attention in the 21st century.
Orthorexia and other disorders
Orthorexia differs from anorexia and bulimia in its relationship to food. Instead of focusing on food intake in an attempt to lose weight and eat less, orthorexia is an "obsession about the quality of food intake" and is fueled by a feeling of achieving perfection and purity by only consuming "healthy" foods.
Orthorexic behaviors can often lead to malnutrition and weight loss, and it is often associated with anorexia nervosa. Studies have also shown that obsessive-compulsive tendencies are linked to the development of orthorexia, and some researchers suggest that orthorexia should be diagnosed as OCD because it is driven by an obsession for attaining a perfect diet.

During the 1996–97 English football season, Stockport County F.C. competed in the Football League Second Division.
Season summary
The 1996–97 season proved to be possibly the most memorable in Stockport County's history. The season began in a forgettable fashion however, recording two draws and four defeats in the first six league matches. A 2nd round League Cup tie against Sheffield United proved to be a catalyst, and Stockport won with a 7–3 aggregate win, including a 5–2 victory at Bramall Lane. Although Stockport reached the northern final of the Auto Windscreens Shield, losing 2–0 on aggregate to Carlisle and just missing out on a visit to Wembley, it was the League Cup which provided the major highlights of the season, with four victories over top-flight opposition. The club, in its third colours for the first and only time in the season, recorded a 1–0 win away at Blackburn Rovers in the 3rd round, due to a colour clash with both the home and away kits. This win was followed by a 4th round 1–1 draw away to West Ham and a 2–1 victory in the replay at Edgeley Park, a quarter final 2–2 draw against Southampton at Edgeley Park followed by a 2–1 victory in the replay at The Dell, and then a semi-final meeting with Middlesbrough. Although County lost the first leg at Edgeley Park 2–0, they won 1–0 at the Riverside Stadium, failing to convert several chances to equalise on aggregate.
After a disappointing start, Stockport also enjoyed a great league campaign, eventually securing promotion from Division Two with a 1–0 victory at Chesterfield in the penultimate match of the season. Had Stockport failed to win the game they would have faced a deciding match away at promotion rivals Luton Town on the final day of the season. As it turned out, County travelled to Kenilworth Road with a chance to win the title, but a 1–1 draw meant that local rivals Bury finished top of the table with Stockport finishing second.

Acacia auripila, commonly known as the Rudall River myall, is a tree of the genus Acacia and the subgenus Plurinerves that is native to a small area in central Western Australia.
Description
The tree typically grows to a height of and has a dense crown with silvery green foliage. It has fissured grey coloured bark and slightly ribbed and glabrescent branchlets. Like most species of Acacia it has phyllodes rather than true leaves. The pungent, glabrescent, leathery and erect phyllodes are straight to slightly curved with a length of and a diameter of and are striated by many fine parallel nerves. It produces yellow flowers in August.
Taxonomy
The species was first formally described by the botanists Richard Sumner Cowan and Bruce Maslin in 1999 as part of the work Acacia miscellany. Miscellaneous new taxa and lectotypifications in Western Australian Acacia, mostly section Plurinerves (Leguminosae: Mimosoideae) as published in the journal Nuytsia. It was reclassified as Racosperma auripilum in 2003 by Leslie Pedley then transferred back to genus Acacia in 2006.
Distribution
It is native to an area in the eastern Pilbara region of Western Australia where it found on hillsides and gullies. Its distribution is limited to the Rudall River National Park as a part of spinifex communities growing in quartz gravel soils.

Midlake is an American folk rock band from Denton, Texas, formed in 1999. The band consists of Eric Pulido, McKenzie Smith, Scott Lee, Eric Nichelson, Jesse Chandler, and Joey McClellan.
In 2012, vocalist, guitarist and primary songwriter Tim Smith left the band during the recording of its fourth studio album. Following his departure, guitarist and backing vocalist Eric Pulido filled Smith's vacated role, and the band started afresh with its recordings, releasing Antiphon in 2013.
The band first gained popularity in Europe, signing to Bella Union Records and later playing at festivals such as Les Inrockuptibles, Wintercase, End of the Road and South by Southwest.
History
Formation
Midlake was formed in 1999 by a group of jazz students at the University of North Texas College of Music. The original lineup consisted of Tim Smith (vocals, guitars, keyboards), McKenzie Smith (drums), Paul Alexander (bass), Eric Nichelson (guitar), and Evan Jacobs (keyboards). Their initial work – under the name "The Cornbread All-Stars" – consisted of funk/jazz explorations heavily influenced by Herbie Hancock. Later, the band began to lean more toward an indie rock sound. Tim Smith quit playing saxophone and began writing songs that were heavily influenced by bands such as Jethro Tull, Radiohead, Björk, and Grandaddy, artists who experiment, while still remaining accessible.
Speaking about the band's influences, Smith commented:
In an interview with Reverb Magazines Nick Milligan, Smith said of the band's origins:
Member changes and The Trials of Van Occupanther
Jacobs left the band and Eric Nichelson took over on keyboard. Jason Upshaw joined the band as a guitarist. Live recordings from this period, recorded at Denton's Panhandle House studio, were never released as the band felt they had moved beyond the material. Not long before the band recorded their debut EP, Milkmaid Grand Army, Upshaw was replaced on guitars by Eric Pulido, a longtime friend of drummer Smith. Their debut full-length album, 2004's Bamnan and Slivercork, was recorded at home in Denton, Texas and mastered at Abbey Road Studios. It showed a move in the direction of lo-fi psychedelic electronica, embracing influences such as Grandaddy and The Flaming Lips. The album even caught the ear of skateboarder-turned-actor Jason Lee, who produced and directed the music video for the song "Balloon Maker", and who continues to support and promote the band.
In 2006, after nearly a year-and-a-half of recording and re-recording, they completed their second release for Bella Union, The Trials of Van Occupanther. The album was a venture into classic-rock revivalism, with a sound reminiscent of Bob Welch-era Fleetwood Mac. The album was met with generally positive reviews. In January 2009, their song "Bandits" was featured in an episode of the FOX television drama Fringe.
The Courage of Others
In February 2010, the band released The Courage of Others, which garnered generally good reviews, notably "album of the month" in Mojo. The album, which showcased Tim Smith's brooding baritone vocals, had a slower pace and denser musical arrangements inspired by British prog-folk acts like Pentangle, Fairport Convention, and The Incredible String Band.
In a 2010 interview with Reverb Magazine, Tim Smith told editor Nick Milligan:
Smith also said in the Reverb Magazine interview that his favourite song from The Courage of Others was "Small Mountain":
Of The Courage of Others, Tim Smith also said:
Departure of Tim Smith
Though the group spent much of 2011 and 2012 recording at the farm in Buffalo, Texas where The Courage of Others was tracked, the recording process stalled. "We knew something was missing," guitarist Eric Pulido said. Midlake played a handful of live dates and debuted new material in 2012, including an appearance at Bella Union's 15th Anniversary End Of The Road Festival on August 31, 2012. Just a few months later, lead vocalist and songwriter Tim Smith announced he was leaving Midlake to form a new project called Harp. Rather than divide the recorded material among the two bands, Midlake abandoned the two years' worth of recordings with Smith and began again from scratch, writing and recording a new full-length album in just six months.
Antiphon and For the Sake of Bethel Woods
In August 2013, Midlake announced the release date for their fourth full-length album, Antiphon, due November 5, 2013 on ATO Records in North America and November 4, 2013 on Bella Union in Europe. Guitarist Eric Pulido stepped into the role of lead vocalist on Antiphon, with backing vocals from Alexander and new members Jesse Chandler (keyboards, piano, flute) and Joey McClellan (guitars). "Antiphon is the most honest representation of the band as a whole, as opposed to one person's vision that we were trying to facilitate," Pulido remarked in the album's press release, which characterizes the new music as "free-flowing in feel, concise in structure ... it's very much Midlake, but uncannily rebooted, and relaxed." In addition to the lineup change, Antiphon marks Midlake's first release on Dave Matthews' ATO Records label, also home to My Morning Jacket, Caitlin Rose, and Stars.

The Christmas frigatebird (Fregata andrewsi), or Christmas Island frigatebird, is a seabird of the frigatebird family Fregatidae which is an endemic breeder to Christmas Island in the Indian Ocean.
The Christmas frigatebird is a large lightly built seabird with brownish-black plumage, long narrow wings and a deeply forked tail. It has a wingspan of around . The male has an egg shaped white patch on his belly and a striking red gular sac which he inflates to attract a mate. The female is slightly larger than the male and has a white breast and belly. They feed on fish taken in flight from the ocean's surface (mostly flying fish), and sometimes indulge in kleptoparasitism, harassing other birds to force them to regurgitate their food. The species is listed as vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature.
Taxonomy and systematics
The Christmas frigatebird was once considered belonging to the species Fregata aquila but in 1914 the Australian ornithologist Gregory Mathews proposed that the Christmas frigatebird should be considered as a separate species with the binomial name Fregata andrewsi in honour of the English paleontogist Charles Andrews. Of the four other species within the genus Fregata, genetic analysis has shown that the Christmas frigatebird is most closely related to the great frigatebird.
Description
The Christmas frigatebird measures in length, has a wingspan of and weighs around . The adult male of this species is easily identified, since he is all black except for a white belly patch. Other plumages resemble those of the smaller lesser frigatebird, but have whiter bellies and longer white underwing spurs.
Status
The Christmas frigatebird is endemic to Christmas Island and breeds in only four main nesting colonies. In 2003 there were 1,200 breeding pairs but as frigatebirds normally breed every other year, the total adult population was estimated to be between 3,600 and 7,200 individuals. The species has a small population and breeds on just one island. It is therefore listed by the International Union for Conservation of Nature as vulnerable.

The following is the 2004–05 network television schedule for the six major English language commercial broadcast networks in the United States. The schedule covers primetime hours from September 2004 through August 2005.

New series are highlighted in bold.
Each of the 30 highest-rated shows is listed with its rank and rating as determined by Nielsen Media Research.
Yellow indicates the top ten most watched programs of the season.
Cyan indicates the top 20 most watched programs of the season.
Magenta indicates the top 30 most watched programs of the season.
Other Legend
Light blue indicates local programming.
Gray indicates encore programming.
Blue-gray indicates news programming.
Light green indicates sporting events.

Kumbakonam railway station is a railway station serving the city of Kumbakonam in Tamil Nadu, India. The station is a part of the Tiruchirappalli railway division of the Southern Railway Zone and connects the city to various parts of the state as well as the rest of the country.The station was declared as cleanest railway station in Tamil Nadu and ranked fifth best in the national level in 2016. It is classified as an "'A' category railway station" in the Trichy railway division of the Southern Railway Zone.It is one of the busiest and top revenue generating stations of the Southern Railway zone after Tiruchirapalli TPJ, Thanjavur TJ in Tiruchirapalli division.

History
The Kumbakonam railway station opened to passenger service on 15 February 1877, when the then South Indian Railway commenced rail traffic between Thanjavur and Mayavaram (now Mayiladuthurai) for a distance of .
Swami Vivekananda, on a yatra from Rameswaram, alighted at Kumbakonam station on January 26, 1897, and it was on that day in Kumbakonam that he gave his "Arise, awake and stop not till the goal is reached" speech to spur the people of the nation. A plaque installed by the Railways in the station proclaims the importance of the event.
Development
After serving the railways for decades, the British-era vintage metre-gauge line was scrapped and the last passenger train on those tracks was operated between Kumbakonam and Chennai Egmore on 1 April 2004 following which the broad-gauge tracks were laid.
Gradually, the station came to have several facilities, including water filling for coaches and steam engines to enjoy the status of an important junction. Kumbakonam station developed quickly, and the works were implemented ahead of the Mahamaham festival in 2004.
Now, a total of 36 trains patronise the station every day serving more than 5,000 passengers. Due to the strong patronage by the region's passengers and commuters, Kumbakonam has enjoyed "Grade A" railway station status.

Leonie Kelly Bennett (born 8 December 1993) is a Dutch cricketer who debuted for the Dutch national side in August 2011. A left-arm orthodox spinner.
Bennett was born in Rotterdam to English parents. After playing for the Dutch under-17 side at the 2009 European Championship, she made her debut for the Netherlands A in June 2010, aged only 16. Bennett made her senior debut for the Netherlands in a 20-over double header against Scotland and Ireland at the 2011 European Twenty20 Championship, although only the game against Ireland held Twenty20 International status. Aged 17 years and 250 days, she became the third-youngest Twenty20 International debutant for the Netherlands, behind Miranda Veringmeier and Denise Hannema. Bennett's ODI debut came two days later against Ireland, as part of the one-day European Championship. On debut, she was the third bowler used, after Laura Brouwers and Jolet Hartenhof, but went wicketless, conceding 26 runs from her five overs.
Retained in the Dutch squad for the 2011 World Cup Qualifier in Bangladesh, Bennett went on to play every match at the tournament, including four further ODIs. Notable performances there included 3/20 against Ireland, a match which had ODI status, and 2/11 against Zimbabwe, which did not. At the 2013 World Twenty20 Qualifier in Ireland, Bennett was the tournament's equal leading wicket-taker (alongside Zimbabwean Hazvinei Saili), finishing with seven wickets at an average of 14.57. Her best figures were 3/15 from four overs against Zimbabwe. Outside of international competition, Bennett has been a regular for the Netherlands in the English domestic competitions in which it participates, including the Women's County Championship. However, her 2014 season was curtailed by an ankle injury. Bennett's club cricket is played for SV Kampong.
In August 2019, she was named in the Dutch squad for the 2019 ICC Women's World Twenty20 Qualifier tournament in Scotland.

Peace Circle is a traffic circle in Washington, D.C., located at the intersection of Pennsylvania Avenue and First Street NW. At its center is the Peace Monument, also known as the Naval Memorial. It is a monument to the naval deaths during the American Civil War. The monument is topped by the allegorical sculptures of Grief and History. On the southeast side facing the United States Capitol there is a figure of Peace, and on the northwest side, there are figures of Victory and the babies Mars and Neptune. The monument is located on Capitol grounds adjacent to the Capitol Reflection Pool. The monument was sculpted by Franklin Simmons and completed in 1878. The monument was restored in the 1990s.
History of Monument
The monument atop Peace Circle is in honor of the sailors who lost their lives during the American Civil War. The monument was originally to be placed at Annapolis, but for an unknown reason was built in Washington D.C. instead. The idea was created by Admiral David D. Porter, he was so enthused with the project that he fundraised for it personally and sketched a draft for it himself, this draft was passed on to Franklin Simmons who ended up sculpting the structure, along with the Bonanni Brothers in Rome Italy. The structure fell into disrepair until the 1970s where the Architect of the Capitol (AOC) was assigned to take care of it, modern weathering such as acid rain and protestors climbing the statue caused even limbs to fall off of the statues. The AOC added a special layer of protective mineral solution in order to protect the marble from modern wear and tear.

In Hawaiian mythology, Laka is the name of two different popular heroes from Polynesian mythology. (In other parts of Polynesia they are known as Rātā, Rata, Lata, Ata, or Lasa). Lengthy legends of their exploits extend throughout the islands, and the kings of Tahiti and Hawaii claimed them as their ancestors.
In one Hawaiian legend, Laka is the son of the Ali'i nui Wahieloa and Hoʻolaukahili, grandson of Kahaʻinuiahema. He plans to sail to Hawaii to avenge the murder of his father, but his canoe-building is thwarted by the little gods of the forest. Because of his offerings to the great gods, however, they give him two outriggers that binds together for his long voyage. He and his companions successfully steal the bones of his father from the cave of Kai-kapu.
Hawai'i
Four deities of this name can be differentiated:
(1) Ku-ka-ohia-LAKA, male patron of the hula-dance Ku-ka-ohia is the god of Hula dancing and canoe building. He is married to Hina-lula-ohia. In temple, he is shown as a feather god and worshiped with the other Ku gods. He is associated with ohia lehua tree, and the flowers are used for decorations on altars during performances.
(2) Papa-o-LAKA, the 'aumakua world of Kumu-Honua
(3) LAKA, goddess of forest growth. Laka is the goddess of Hula. Laka is said to be the inspiration a person thinks of while they dance. She is what causes the movement while the dancer is moved. She is also the goddess of the forest. She has reproductive energy which is said to help the forest grow and thrive. Laka is associated with the Lama tree, the Maile Vine, and the a'ali'i plant. They are her kinolau, which means they are the form she can be found in. These are very cherished and treated with high levels of respect.
(4) LAKA, son of Wahie-loa
Marquesas
In the Marquesan version of the myth, Aka is a great voyager, grandson of Tafaki. He made a historic voyage to Aotona (Rarotonga) in what are now the Cook Islands to obtain the highly prized feathers of a red parrot as gifts for his son and daughter. The voyage was done in a great outrigger canoe named Va'ahiva that had 140 rowers.

Büdingen (Oberhess) station is a station on the Gießen–Gelnhausen railway (also known as the Lahn-Kinzig Railway) in the town of Büdingen in the German state of Hesse. The station is located in the centre of the town. Büches-Düdelsheim station is also located in the municipality, in the district of Büches. The station is classified by Deutsche Bahn (DB) as a category 5 station.
History
The station was opened on 30 October 1870 as the end of the third section of the Lahn Gießen–Gelnhausen railway (Nidda–Büdingen) by the Upper Hessian Railway Company (). Exactly a month later, the railway was extended to Gelnhausen.
The entrance hall of the station is now listed as a monument under the Hessian Heritage Act. The station building is now privately owned and is no longer used for rail purposes. The condition has deteriorated and dilapidated.
Operations
Büdingen is served by the RB (Regionalbahn) 36 service of the Hessische Landesbahn (Hessian State Railway, HLB) on the Gießen–Nidda–Glauburg-Stockheim–Gelnhausen route. The “house” platform (platform 1) is used by trains towards Gelnhausen. Track 2 is used by trains towards Nidda or Gießen. The service operates at 60-minute intervals in both directions, but is supplemented by an extra service towards Gelnhausen in the morning peak and after lunch and from Gelnhausen in the evening peak. Gießen can be reached in around 75 minutes by train, and Frankfurt (with a change in Gelnhausen to the RE 50 service) in about an hour.
The Lahn-Kinzig Railway also offers interchanges in Nidda (with SE/RB 32 towards Friedberg or Frankfurt) and in Glauburg-Stockheim (with RE/RB 34 towards Bad Vilbel or Frankfurt).
Buses
Büdingen station is connected by several bus routes to the surrounding area.

Weakling was an American black metal band from San Francisco. The band never toured and released only one album, Dead as Dreams, recorded in 1998 and released on Tumult Records in 2000.
History
The name Weakling, according to founding member John Gossard, came from the title of a song by the band Swans from their album Filth.
Weakling was initially started by guitarist John Gossard and guitarist/drum programmer Robert Williams of Ubzub. The two ended up releasing an early version of "No One Can be Called As A Man While He'll Die" on a compilation tape Wintergrief released by Nahitfol Productions in 1996. Briefly, Gossard and Williams continued with Weakling adding Jim Mack on bass, and Antoine Reuben Diavola on drums. Dissatisfied with the dedication of the members, Gossard left the band while the rest of the lineup continued on as Black Goat. The one idea contributed by Mack for the song "This Entire Fucking Battlefield" was later discovered to have been 'borrowed' from the Norwegian band Demonic's song "Nar Morket Faller".
Prior to the release of the album, a few odd tales sprung up about the possible ways it could be distributed, including printing a single copy to be given to a single fan in Europe or burying copies of the album in the ground and giving maps to fans who wanted to find them. Band leader John Gossard has since decried the spread of these stories as a publicity stunt pulled by the band's record label noting that the ideas were never intended to be more than a joke between the band members.
Initially, Weakling was mainly noted for featuring guitarist Josh Smith of The Fucking Champs (fellow Champ Tim Green served as producer), but a recent reissue of their material has brought their work some more attention, and the album has been hailed in some circles, and by musicians including Fenriz of Darkthrone, as a masterpiece. Weakling's sound displays inspiration from the works of Scandinavian bands like Bathory, Burzum and Darkthrone, as one might imagine it filtered through the lens of '70s progressive rock: all five songs on the 76-minute album run at least 10 minutes in length and each is composed of at least 2 distinct sections.
Gossard and bassist Sarah Weiner later played together in the similarly short-lived doom metal band The Gault (although Weiner was the drummer of that outfit); after that band's demise, Gossard went on to join established funeral doom outfit Asunder, and formed a second black metal band, Dispirit, in the wake of Asunder's dissolution. Keyboardist Casey Ward currently plays drums in The Husbands. Drummer Sam Foster currently plays drums for death metal band Saros.
Although Weakling has never officially announced a split, they broke up in 1999.

Matthew Mahan is an American politician and tech entrepreneur, now serving his first term on the San Jose City Council as the District 10 Councilmember representing the Almaden Valley, Blossom Valley, and Vista Park neighborhoods. Previously, Mahan served as the Co-Founder and CEO of Brigade Media, a tech company focused on civic engagement.
Early life and education
Mahan was raised in Watsonville, California. He attended Bellarmine College Preparatory in San Jose on a low-income scholarship. While in high school, Mahan worked with former State Senator Jim Beall and former Santa Clara Counsel Ann Ravel. Mahan graduated from Harvard University in 2005.
Career
After Harvard, Mahan spent the next year building irrigation systems in Bolivia. He then joined Teach for America where he taught at Alum Rock Middle School.
In 2008, Mahan joined a tech startup led by Sean Parker and Joe Green. Together, they formed Causes, an early Facebook application focused on grassroots and public engagement that helped raise money for nonprofit organizations. Mahan became CEO and president of Causes in 2013.
In 2014, Mahan launched Brigade with investments from Parker, Ron Conway, Marc Benioff, and others. Brigade was created as a social medium for civil engagement. In 2019, Brigade was acqui-hired by Pinterest and its technology was purchased by Countable. Writer Douglas Rushkoff would offer a criticism about the use case for Brigade in 2022, writing that "Brigade's engineers built some clever algorithms for matching voters with their districts and elected representatives, but no one had checked to see whether civic tech developers were in need of a centralized hub. The startup was shuttered in 2019." He went on to group Brigade alongside "the 2020 Covid-19 Global Hackathon," as, "in the words of civic tech journalist and historian Micah Sifry, 'a big fat nothingburger.'"
In early 2020, Mahan entered the San Jose City Council District 10 race. He won with 58% of the vote, and in January 2021, was sworn in as the District 10 Council member for the city of San Jose.
In September 2021 Mahan became a candidate for Mayor of San Jose, focusing on a platform of accountability in government. He is proposing an Accountability Dashboard which would track progress on issues like crime and homelessness and end the current system of automatic raises for politicians and city department heads unless progress is shown.

In Māori mythology, Taranga is the mother of Māui. Her husband is Makeatutara. Māui was born prematurely, so Taranga wrapped his body in her hair and threw him into the waves. Some sea-creatures cared for him, hiding him in kelp until a storm sent him back to the beach. His ancestor, Tama-nui-a-rangi, found him and brought him back to life, and educated him.
Māui arrived at his mother's village one day, and recognized his brothers. Taranga didn't know who he was until Māui reminded her of the circumstances of his birth. Each morning, Taranga would disappear and eventually Māui followed her to the underworld by assuming the shape of a wood pigeon. Māui found her with his father, Makeatutara, a guardian of the underworld. Taranga introduced them and his father performed the dedicatory ritual over his son. Because Makeatutara made mistakes in the incantation, Māui was fated to die and thus humankind is mortal.
In some versions, Taranga is a man, the son of Murirangawhenua. He married Irawhaki, and begat the Māui brothers.

History
In 1884, the Government school system was established to provide educational facilities to all students, including those in rural areas. Until the late 1870s, many children were not able to access education due to geographical isolation, commonly living in impoverished conditions. This was mostly due to the sparse settlement in New South Wales. House to house schools rose in popularity during the 1890s but the minimum enrolment numbers for a school to be viable were proving difficult to reach, causing a decline in the use of the house to house system. The subsidy scheme introduced in 1903 aimed to bring easier access to education for these children by subsidising isolated families so they could afford private teaching. Although the scheme succeeded, there were still children without access to education due to their family's financial circumstances not being able to accommodate private teaching despite the subsidy.
Travelling schools were first introduced as an alternative method of public education in 1908. Reports conducted by inspectors for the New South Wales Department of Education in 1912 showed of school aged children living west of the Great Dividing Range, 1014 were not attending school. Due to this, the travelling schools scheme was expanded, announced by the Minister of Public Instruction in 1913. In 1915, there were three travelling schools, with a collective enrolment of 85 students. Travelling schools were predominantly used during World War I (1914–1918) to provide education separate from a physical institution. Work was shared through radio and print. After the war they were closed down. The Department of Education made the decision to suspend travelling schools, replacing them with correspondence schools. The Department of Education opened The Correspondence School in place of travelling schools at the Department's Bridge Street headquarters in 1916 to accommodate students who may struggle with on-campus learning. The majority of schools were located in urban areas, creating geographical difficulty for students living in rural areas attending school. This includes regional areas where 67% of students complete their HSC compared to 81% of urban students. The Department of Education started recommending the Correspondence School to students wanting to enrol in travelling schools and rejected most applications for the establishment of new travelling schools in New South Wales.
As travelling schools closed, The Correspondence School's enrolment numbers increased. The 25 students enrolled at the Inverell Travelling School were transferred to the Correspondence School due to the schools closure in 1921. The school's expansion created the need for a physical location to facilitate the continuation of distance education. This resulted in the Teachers College, now known as the Sydney Distance Education High School, becoming a secondary school in Blackfriars, Sydney in 1922. In 1923, the first Schools for Specific Purpose were established by the Department of Education. These catered for students struggling with disabilities and other circumstances that interrupted their education. Therefore, the Teacher's College was known as a School for Specific Purposes. Enrolment at the Correspondence School reached 2555 students in 1925, with 60 teaching staff. In 1959, enrolment levels began to lower due to improvements in access to traditional education methods, especially for rural students in New South Wales. Students were now given the option to study single subjects through the school, due to the introduction of the Wyndham Scheme in 1961. The scheme created the current (as of 2020) secondary school curriculum where in ‘junior school' (year 7) students complete a set of common compulsory subjects and in second, third and fourth form (years 8, 9 and 10) they complete a set of compulsory subjects along with two elective subjects. It also introduced new criteria for the School Certificate, received at the end of fifth form (year 11). This scheme led to an increase in enrolments.
In 1965, multiple satellite schools opened in Walgett, Bourke, Cobar and Nyngan and The Correspondence School moved to William Street in Kings Cross. Dover Heights High School became a shared space with the opening of the Sydney Secondary Distance Education Centre in 1999. The school relocated to Forbes Street, Woolloomooloo in 2002 and was renamed Sydney Distance Education High School. The digital learning format of an eLearning Portal as a platform storing school files and accessibility to video chat facilities was used during the coronavirus pandemic in 2020 as an example for educational institutions transferring to online learning.

Fair Warning is a 2020 thriller written by American author Michael Connelly. It is the third novel featuring Jack McEvoy, a Los Angeles investigative reporter for the consumer watchdog news service Fair Warning, as well as former FBI agent Rachel Walling. The novel is a sequel to the events in Connelly's 2009 book The Scarecrow. Themes explored in the book include the decline of investigative journalism and the print-newspaper, the rise of fake news, the misogynistic incel movement, and the dangers of trafficking in DNA sequence data by an industry having no government oversight or regulations.
The story is told in first-person narrative from the perspective of McEvoy, however, it occasionally swaps to third-person when following antagonists Marshall Hammond and The Shrike. Two chapters are stylized as news articles.
McEvoy's employer and its editor Myron Levin are both based on the real-life news service FairWarning with Myron Levin as its editor. FairWarning dissolved in February 2021.
Plot summary
A drunk woman drives home with an unknown man. They go up to her apartment and have sex, before he puts her in a headlock and squeezes her neck. As she begins to lose consciousness, he tells her people call him "The Shrike".
Upon arriving at his apartment in the following days, reporter Jack McEvoy, now writing for the consumer watchdog news service FairWarning out of Los Angeles, is stopped by two L.A.P.D. detectives. They inform him that a woman he had a one-night stand with several months ago, Tina Portrero, was found dead in her shower, and that she had suffered atlanto-occipital-dislocation in what they believe was staged to look like an accident. The detectives leave after interrogating Jack and taking a DNA sample.
Reflecting on his history with Tina, Jack decides to investigate further. He leaves a post in a forum for coroners asking for any examples of recent AOD deaths. He looks into the few examples he finds and discovers that all of them submitted samples of their DNA to an ancestry website called GT23. Unsure of where to look next, Jack reconnects with former FBI agent Rachel Walling. She suggests the possibility of sex addiction being a common trait in the victims and joins Jack on the investigation.
Jack finds out that GT23 has a history of selling DNA samples to a company called Orange Nano and prepares an interview a board member of the company, William Orton, a former professor who was accused of raping one of his students until the DNA left on her body came up with no match. Before he can leave, he is arrested outside of his apartment by the detectives for obstruction.
A lab technician named Marshall Hammond works in a laboratory. He receives a text and finds Jack's name in the police system. Concerned, he and his partner Roger Vogel watch Jack in court until he is freed and returns to his investigation. Jack takes a fellow writer at FairWarning, Emily Atwater, onto the case. She finds Marshall Hammond's side DNA analysis business and informs Jack that he exclusively buys female DNA from Orange Nano. In the morning, a masked man breaks into Hammond's home and steals multiple profiles of women with the DRD4 gene. When Hammond returns home, the intruder introduces himself as The Shrike. He questions him on his operation, and then twists his neck until it breaks, similar to how a shrike executes its prey, before staging it as a suicide.
Jack goes straight to Hammond's house with Rachel to find him hanging. Before calling the police, they print copies of the women's profiles and conceal it in Jack's car. With their editor Myron Levin, Jack and Emily deduce that Hammond was running an illicit website where he sold the information of women with the DRD4 gene to incels who intended to take advantage of them, and that a user on the sight, The Shrike, was instead murdering them. They begin the search for Hammond's partner and share some of their findings with the FBI.
The Shrike murders a man after falsely identifying him as Vogel, breaking his neck and throwing him off a parking garage. After receiving Vogel's identity from the FBI, Emily, Rachel, and Jack go to meet him at work. Vogel admits that he knows how to find The Shrike, but is abruptly ran over in the road and killed by The Shrike himself, who escapes before the FBI can interfere. He later destroys all evidence and escapes Los Angeles.
Months later, the case has been made public and the staff of FairWarning have published novels and hosted podcasts on the case. When Jack meets Rachel in a bar, she points out that a man in the corner has been staring at her all night. They report this to the FBI and send them a picture. They concoct a plan to bait the man out and trap him. They block the man in his car and shoot him after he pulls out a gun. He is only suspected of being a supporter of The Shrike looking to kill Rachel.
After another few months, as Jack is leaving a podcast recording, he nearly gets into a car accident and feels movement in the back of his car. Realizing that The Shrike is in his car, he texts Rachel to warn her. They set up a plan for him to drive off a highway and into a trap so that they can capture The Shrike, though, on his way there, he is caught in a traffic jam. When The Shrike reveals himself, he steps on the gas and veers down the shoulder and around the traffic. The Shrike wraps his arm around Jack's neck, triggering him to swerve the car to the side and flip it. As it tumbles several times, The Shrike is thrown from the window and is crushed under the car. As bystanders rush to the crash, an injured Jack observes the scene. He later learns that The Shrike was never able to be identified.
After Jack recovers, he visits Rachel at her place of work and proposes that she joins him on investigating crimes themselves, as he is disappointed with a lack of justice and can no longer simply report on them. She accepts.
Reception
Barry Forshaw wrote in the Financial Times, "Connelly is an astute commentator on American society, notably the prevalence of fake news filtering from the highest political echelons down to every stratum of society." Critic Marilyn Stasio wrote in The New York Times, "Connelly is in terrific form here, applying genre conventions to the real-life dangers inherent in the commercial marketing of genetics research." Sandra Dallas wrote in the Denver Post that the novel "sheds light on the murky billion-dollar world of DNA testing.... [which has] little in the way of oversight or enforcement. Labs are licensed but essentially operate on their own. All that makes the subject ripe for a good mystery. And Michael Connelly is just the guy to write it."

The Oregon Trunk Rail Bridge or Celilo Bridge is a single-track railroad bridge opened in 1912 over the Columbia River in the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It consists of eight steel truss spans and several deck girder spans, and since 1957 it has included a vertical-lift section. The bridge was designed by engineer Ralph Modjeski and erected by the Missouri Valley Bridge & Iron Co., of Leavenworth, Kansas.
It is part of the Wishram, Washington to Bend, Oregon line of the BNSF Railway (formerly the Oregon Trunk line of the Spokane, Portland and Seattle Railway). The bridge is downstream of the site of Celilo Falls, now submerged by water impounded by The Dalles Dam. The Celilo Canal passed beneath the southernmost span, which was a swing span. Completion of The Dalles Dam in 1957 inundated the canal. Over a period of several months starting in October 1956, the bridge was raised by up to over its entire length, and the truss span to the north of the swing span was modified to a vertical-lift-type span for river navigation. The new lift span's first complete raising and lowering took place on June 21, 1957, and the bridge reopened to rail traffic the following day. The swing span, to the south of the lift span, remains in place, but it ceased to be used after the lift span was installed. It was "permanently locked in place" in October 1956, for the start of work to modify the bridge.
All of the bridge's piers rest on rocks that were normally exposed during low water periods. During periods of high water, this stretch of the Columbia River became raging rapids, so the piers were built during low water. The north end of the bridge is a wye, where the rail line from Bend meets the BNSF Portland to Pasco mainline. On the south end of the bridge, the line crosses over and interchanges with the Union Pacific mainline. Excluding the two branches at the north end, the bridge is long. The wye's east leg is long, and its west leg long.
When built, the bridge's longest span was a fixed span located just to the north of the swing span; that section was later replaced by a lift span.

I Don't Remember Ever Growing Up is the forty-third and final studio album by American pop singer Andy Williams, released in the UK by the Demon Music Group in 2007. In the liner notes of the album Williams writes, "Over the past few years I have come across songs that I really wanted to record. I picked 13 of my favorites and set out to make a new record." While the title track is the only new song, the other 12 selections were chart hits for other artists or, as is the case with "Desperado" by the Eagles, received critical acclaim without having been released as a single.

Song information
Neil Sedaka's first recording of "Breaking Up Is Hard to Do" reached number one on Billboard magazine's Hot 100 in 1962, but on this album Williams pays tribute to Sedaka's much slower 1975 version that went to number one on the magazine's Adult Contemporary chart and got as high as number eight pop. "The Shadow of Your Smile" is the title track from Williams's spring of 1966 release, and "Desperado" comes from the 1973 album of the same name by the Eagles. Rod Stewart's first recording of "I Don't Want to Talk About It" was released in 1975 and peaked at number 46 on the pop chart, but his 1990 remake, while not a Hot 100 hit, did reach the Adult Contemporary chart, where it made it to number two.
The Police spent eight weeks at number one on the Hot 100 with "Every Breath You Take" in 1983. "Lady in Red" by Chris de Burgh reached number two Adult Contemporary and number three pop in 1987, the same year in which Smokey Robinson got to number eight pop, number two R&B, and number one Adult Contemporary with "Just to See Her". Van Morrison took "Have I Told You Lately" to number 12 Adult Contemporary in 1989, and Rod Stewart spent five weeks at number one with the song on that same chart in addition to peaking at number five pop in 1993.
"Have You Ever Really Loved a Woman?" by Bryan Adams enjoyed five weeks at number one on Billboard magazine's Hot 100 and Adult Contemporary charts in 1995. "One Sweet Day" by Mariah Carey and Boyz II Men was released later that year and lasted 16 weeks at number one on the pop chart, 13 weeks at number one Adult Contemporary, and nine weeks at number two R&B. "I'll Never Break Your Heart" by the Backstreet Boys spent seven weeks at number one on the Adult Contemporary chart and reached number four on Billboard's Hot 100 Airplay list in 1998, and Robbie Williams's recording of "She's the One" was at number one for a week in the UK in 1999.

Teugn is a municipality in the district of Kelheim in Bavaria in Germany.
History
Teugn was the site of the battle of Teugen-Hausen in 1809, when a French army led by Marshal Davout defeated an Austrian army led by Prince Friedrich Franz Xaver of Hohenzollern-Hechingen.
During World War II, a subcamp of the Nazi concentration camp Flossenbürg, named Ringberg Me,
was installed nearby the street connecting Teugn and the neighboring village Saal an der Donau. The goal was to construct an underground arms industry plant
for Messerschmitt, a German aircraft manufacturer. At peak times more than 600 men were imprisoned in the subcamp. After the war 20 bodies and the ashes of about 360 people were found.

Nice Work If You Can Get It: Songs by the Gershwins is a 1996 album by American vocalist Michael Feinstein of songs composed by George Gershwin.
It was Feinstein's second album of Gershwin's music, following Pure Gershwin (1987) and preceding Michael & George: Feinstein Sings Gershwin (1998).
Reception
The Allmusic review by William Ruhlmann awarded the album four ½ stars and compared the album to Feinstein's earlier all-Gershwin album Pure Gershwin (1987). Feinstein had previously been a secretary to Ira Gershwin, and Ruhlmann remarks that "the man has the heart of a research assistant, but few history lessons are this much fun". Feinstein's research is evident on this album, with debut recordings of the songs "Anything for You" and "Will You Remember Me?".

Myron Bierdeman Gessaman (October 15, 1894 – August 20, 1975) was a Republican politician from the U.S. state of Ohio and a veteran of the United States Army during World War I. He served as mayor of Columbus, a prosecutor and judge of Franklin County, and as a member and floor leader of the Ohio House of Representatives.
Biography
Myron Bierdeman Gessaman was born October 15, 1894 in Youngstown, Mahoning County, Ohio. His parents were George D. and Frances L. Gessaman. He received his education through the public schools in Youngstown and graduated from Rayen High School. While enrolled at Western Reserve University he enlisted into the United States Army when the United States entered World War I. He served in the U.S. Army Ambulance Service and transported wounded individuals from the Battle of Saint-Mihiel and the Meuse-Argonne Offensive to hospitals. During the First Armistice at Compiègne, Gessaman stayed behind for evacuation duty, then served in Germany with the Army of Occupation. After returning home, he resumed his course work at Western Reserve University towards a law degree.
He was admitted to the Ohio bar in 1919. After graduating from Reserve Law School in 1920, he worked briefly for the private law firm of F. Stanley Crooks. Afterwards, he worked as the assistant City Attorney for Columbus (1923–1928), assistant Franklin County prosecutor (1928–1931), was elected to the Ohio House of Representatives (1933–1935), and served as majority floor leader while a state legislator in 1935.
During 1935, the Republicans of Columbus selected him as their candidate to run for mayor. He won the 1935 mayoral election defeating incumbent Democratic mayor Henry W. Worley. Gessaman became the 42nd mayor of Columbus, Ohio, the 38th person to serve in that office, and served Columbus during the Great Depression. After one term in office he was defeated in the 1939 mayoral election by Republican opponent Floyd F. Green. After his defeat for reelection as mayor, he was later elected as a judge to the Franklin County Common Pleas Court in 1943. He served as judge for 30 years.
He married Marie C. Sommer in 1922 and had three children - Ann, David G., and Richard. His youngest son Richard was killed in Korea in 1954. Two years after his retirement from the Franklin County Common Pleas Court he died on August 20, 1975. He is interred at Union Cemetery in Columbus, Ohio.

Charles Wesley Hunt was an American educator and academic administrator. He served as the 3rd President of the State University of New York at Oneonta. During his tenure as president, the college transitioned from being known as Oneonta State Normal School to Oneonta State Teachers College. The Hunt Union building on the SUNY Oneonta is named in his honor, as well as some of the school-sponsored comedy events being called "Chuck's Comedy Club".
Hunt was born on October 20, 1880, in Charlestown, New Hampshire. He attended school in Saxtons River, Vemont, and went on to attend Brown University and Columbia University.
After graduation, Hunt taught in Saxtons River and Providence. He was the principal of a school in Briarcliff Manor, New York. Hunt served in a variety of academic roles at universities including Columbia University, the University of Pittsburgh, and Case Western Reserve University.
Hunt became principal of the Oneonta Normal School in 1933. When the institution became a four-year college in 1938, Hunt became the first individual to be named president of the college. During Hunt's tenure as president, he was instrumental in convincing local government leaders to invest in acreage to expand the campus. Under Hunt's leadership, the quality of campus life increased, socially and academically. The faculty to student ratio was reduced, the library was expanded, and salaries were raised for employees. Hunt would leave this role in 1951.
Hunt died on September 3, 1973, at the age of 92.

History
Uptown McComb, the first and only enclosed shopping mall in McComb, was built in 1987 by Prescott Sherman. Anchored by JCPenney, Beall-Ladymon, and Walmart, the mall opened its doors as Edgewood Mall in July 1987 with a total of of retail space. The mall was built on land owned by the Sherman family.
In 1994, the Beall-Ladymon chain was bought out and converted to a Stage in early 1995. Walmart relocated next door as a Supercenter in 1998, and Sears replaced the former Walmart anchor in March 1999. A major overhaul of the mall in 1999 included a expansion of the JCPenney anchor, construction of an additional of space for specialty shops, and addition of fourth large () anchor, Mississippi-based McRae's. This expansion, capped by a grand re-opening in September 1999, left the mall with over of retail space.
In 2002, Mississippi Business Journal reported that Prescott Sherman had given $2 million to the School of Engineering at the University of Mississippi from the Edgewood Mall. Ashley Furniture HomeStore opened in late 2007, and Stage was converted to Goody's in September 2011. Sears closed in 2012. Hobby Lobby took one half of the former Sears anchor in 2015. Marshalls took the other half of the former Sears anchor in 2016. Tire Doctor has also set up shop in the former Sears anchor. Edgewood Mall was sold to RockStep Capital in 2017. In 2019, Stage Stores announced that it would convert all of its stores to Gordmans, including the Goody's at Edgewood Mall. This conversion was to supposed to take place in 2020. JCPenney closed in July 2019. Edgewood Mall was renamed Uptown McComb in July 2020.

Samuel Lahm (April 22, 1812 – June 16, 1876) was a lawyer, politician, and U.S. Representative from Ohio for one term from 1847 to 1849.
Early life and career
He was the father of Frank Samuel Lahm, a noted expatriate and pioneer balloonist, and the grandfather of Brigadier General Frank Purdy Lahm, aerial pioneer, student of the Wright brothers, and the first military officer to fly an airplane. He married Almira Brown of New Hampshire and was related by marriage to Daniel Webster. The couple had five children: Marshall, Edward, Frank Samuel, Charles Henry, and Helen Rebecca. The two eldest sons served in the 115th Ohio Volunteer Infantry during the American Civil War and died in service within three weeks of each other, by sickness. In 1855 Almira Lahm died and Lahm remarried, to Henrietta Faber of Pittsburgh. Lahm and Henrietta had three daughters.
Born in Leitersburg, Maryland, he was of German descent, his parents having emigrated from Germany. Lahm completed preparatory studies and then taught school. He attended Washington College (now Washington & Jefferson College in Washington, Pennsylvania. He studied law with Oliver H. Smith in Indiana. Lahm was admitted to the Ohio bar in 1836 and moved to Canton, Ohio to open a practice. He intended to return to Leitersburg, but stopped in Canton, Ohio and was pleased with the place. He partnered with Andrew W. Loomis until Loomis left the state in 1841. He served as the master of chancery from 1837 to 1841 and prosecuting attorney of Stark County from 1837 to 1845. He served two terms as a member of the Ohio Senate in 1842. He was selected as a delegate to the Democratic National Convention in 1844 in Baltimore, Maryland.
Lahm was appointed as a brigadier general in the state's antebellum militia, and commanded the 2nd Brigade, 6th Division of Ohio during the Mexican War.
Congress
He was an unsuccessful candidate for election in 1844 to the Twenty-ninth Congress. However, he was elected as a Democrat to the Thirtieth Congress and served from March 4, 1847 – March 3, 1849. He lost election to Ohio's 18th congressional district in 1856. Lahm served as a delegate to the 1860 Democratic National Convention
Later career and death
Retiring from politics, he engaged in agricultural pursuits and sheep raising.
He died in Canton on June 16, 1876, and was interred in West Lawn Cemetery.

J. J. Perry is an American martial artist, action director, actor, and stuntman.
Career
Perry began practicing martial arts training in 1975, at the age of eight. Because his mother was not able to afford her son's lessons, he cleaned a martial arts school, and received lessons in trade. He began performing stunt work in the late 1980s after leaving the military.
Perry was a fourth-degree black belt in taekwondo by 1993.
He began his acting career when he did stunt work for the character of Johnny Cage in the first Mortal Kombat film. He then played Scorpion, Cyrax, and Noob Saibot in Mortal Kombat: Annihilation (Chris Casamassa was supposed to reprise as Scorpion but was working on the film Batman & Robin, though he would return in Conquest), and appeared in the MK: Conquest TV series, this time as Scorpion's main rival Sub-Zero, in addition to doing stuntwork for the main character of Kung Lao. In addition to the Mortal Kombat series, Perry has done stuntwork for various television shows and movies such as Buffy the Vampire Slayer, The Scorpion King, 24, Beowulf and The Town as FBI Swat 2. He was a member of the cast of the 2004 movie Sunland Heat, and part of the stunt team for the 2006 fighting movie Ultraviolet.
Perry shared in the Male Stuntman of the Year Award at the 2004 World Stunt Awards for his work in the 2003 action comedy film The Rundown. He was also voted 2012 Stunt Coordinator of the Year at the short-lived (2010-2012) ActionFest action movie festival (founded by Chuck Norris's stunt double, director, and younger brother Aaron Norris).

The Wrestlers (also known as The Two Wrestlers, The Uffizi Wrestlers or The Pancrastinae) is a Roman marble sculpture after a lost Greek original of the third century BCE. It is now in the Uffizi collection in Florence, Italy.
Description, style and authorship
The two young men are engaged in the pankration, a kind of wrestling similar to the present-day sport of mixed martial arts. The two figures are wrestling in a position now known as a "cross-body ride" in modern folkstyle wrestling. The upper wrestler has his left leg entwined with his opponent's left leg, with his body across the opponent's body, lifting the opponent's right arm. In a well-known modern series of wrestling moves, the upper wrestler would now try to lift his opponent's arm above his head to force a pinning move called the "Guillotine." Their muscular structure is very defined and exaggerated due to their physical and sustained effort.
Neither of the two heads are original to the group, though that of the lower figure is older and is as advanced stylistically as the sons in the "Niobe Group". The heads were added after the sculpture was rediscovered.
The group is considered to be the finest quality Roman copies of a lost bronze. Not every 20th-century viewer admired "a work once famous and now unfairly neglected", as art historian Kenneth Clark said of it: "If we can bring our eyes to rest on the unpleasant surface of a somewhat lifeless replica, we discover that the original must have been a Lysippic bronze of masterly complexity and condensation." The sculpture has been attributed variously to Myron, Cephisodotus the Younger or Heliodorus. The last two are mentioned by Pliny as creators of a sculptural format called symplegmata, signifying sculptures of figures closed in struggle, whether purely physical or amatory. Currently the sculpture is considered to be the best-quality Roman copy from a lost original Hellenistic bronze of the third century BCE, either of the Pergamene school or the circle of Lysippus.
Rediscovery
The discovery of The Wrestlers caused such an immediate sensation among the cognoscenti of Rome, that the event can be dated to the very end of March or beginning of April 1583, in a vigna belonging to the Tommasini da Gallese family near Porta San Giovanni, Rome, together with the group of individual sculptures called the Niobids. Circumstances of their discovery, and the fact that the heads were missing, led early antiquarians—and the engravers who worked to their direction—to group the paired figures with these Niobids.
Within days of their excavation, Valerio Cioli, a sculptor and restorer of Roman antiquities in Rome, was writing to the secretary of Francesco I de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany, to alert his patron to the discovery, and the Medici lost no time: on 25 June the group, and the Niobids were purchased from a member of the Varese family, who had managed to gain possession of them in the intervening weeks, by the Grand Duke's brother (and eventual heir) Ferdinando Cardinal de' Medici, who took it to add to the outstanding gallery of antiquities at Villa Medici. There it was illustrated in an engraving of 1594.
The Wrestlers are now among the Medici collections in the Galerie degli Uffizi. where it was a main feature of the Tribuna of the Uffizi.
The sculpture was cleaned of its former somewhat oily patina. The sculpture has been reproduced in marble, bronze and plaster, and in modern times cast in resin, both in full size and in miniature, and the subject in general was treated by Michelangelo. Philippe Magnier produced a marble copy of the group ca 1684-87 for the gardens of Versailles - it was later moved to Marly, and is now in the Louvre.

The Congress of Erfurt was the meeting between Napoleon, Emperor of the French, and Alexander I, Emperor of All Russia, from Tuesday 27 September to Friday 14 October 1808 intended to reaffirm the alliance concluded the previous year with the Treaties of Tilsit which followed the end of the War of the Fourth Coalition.
Background
At Tilsit, Napoleon had made an admirer of Alexander, but by the time of the meeting at Erfurt anti-French sentiment at the Russian court was beginning to threaten the newly forged alliance. Napoleon and his foreign minister Jean-Baptiste Nompère de Champagny sought to strengthen the alliance once more in order to settle affairs in Spain and prepare for the expected war with Austria. Working at cross-purposes to Napoleon was Charles Maurice de Talleyrand-Périgord who had by this time come to the conclusion that Napoleon was leading France to destruction, and who secretly advised Alexander to resist Napoleon's demands.
Conference
The city of Erfurt was under the direct control of the Emperor of the French at this time as Principality of Erfurt. Napoleon attempted to awe Alexander with the glories of the French Empire. The meeting became a great conference involving an array of kings, princes, dukes, barons and notables from all over Europe. Among the attendees was Talma and the entire Comedie Française, who presented sixteen French tragedies over the course of the Congress. Goethe was courted by Napoleon himself and the twenty-year-old Arthur Schopenhauer arrived in Goethe's train and cast a cynical eye over the proceedings.
Out of the meetings came an agreement, the Erfurt Convention, in fourteen articles, calling upon Britain to cease its war against France, recognizing the Russian conquest of Finland from Sweden, and stating that in case of war with Austria, Russia should aid France "to the best of its ability." The two emperors departed for their homelands on 14 October. Six months later the expected war with Austria began, and Alexander barely lived up to his agreement, aiding France as little as possible. By 1810 both emperors were considering war with one another. Erfurt was the last meeting between the two leaders.
By 1812 Russia no longer complied with Napoleon's Continental System of economic warfare against the United Kingdom and anti-French sentiment in the Russian court had reached a new height. Russian defence spending had increased and troops were deployed to the border in preparation for an invasion of Poland. Napoleon pre-empted this by attacking first and with greater force.
From the beginning at Tilsit few onlookers believed these two European powers could peacefully exist side by side, with the Grand Duchy of Warsaw a French satellite state neighbouring Russia. Erfurt may have delayed the eventual outbreak of war, but it was likely the two powers would ultimately come into conflict.
In popular culture
The congress is an event referred to by Leo Tolstoy in his War and Peace (Book Two Part Three Chapter 1).

History of Erfurt
David John Skal (born June 21, 1952 in Garfield Heights, Ohio) is an American cultural historian, critic, writer, and on-camera commentator known for his research and analysis of horror films and horror literature.
Early life
Skal studied journalism at Ohio University, where he worked as a film critic and assistant editor for the college's newspaper. He graduated with a bachelor's degree in 1974. After graduation, he interned with the National Endowment for the Arts and became the publicity director for the Hartford Stage Company.
He later held positions with the American Conservatory Theater in San Francisco and the Theatre Communications Group of New York. During the 1980s, Skal completed three science fiction novels: Scavengers (1980), When We Were Good (1981), and Antibodies (1988).
Non-fiction writing
Skal's first nonfiction work was 1990's Hollywood Gothic: The Tangled Web of Dracula from Novel to Stage to Screen. This book discusses the various adaptations of Bram Stoker's 1897 novel Dracula, and the role of the vampire archetype in popular culture. A large portion of the book describes the efforts of Stoker's widow Florence to protect the rights to her husband's work. The book also contains the first in-depth study of a Spanish-language Dracula film produced in 1931. Kathleen Quinn of The New York Times praised Hollywood Gothic, writing, "Skal tracks Transylvania's most popular vampire with dry wit and the skills of a fine detective." Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times called it "witty and comprehensive", and quipped that it was "something to gnaw on long after those trick-or-treaters are gone". Writing in 2004, David Colton of USA Today noted that the book had "become one of the field's essential reads" and had "[raised] the standards for horror researchers".
In 1993, Skal released his second non-fiction book, titled The Monster Show: A Cultural History of Horror. In this book, Skal analyzes the history of horror films, drawing parallels between those films and the cultural crises of their times, such as World War I, World War II, the thalidomide controversies, and the AIDS epidemic. M.L. Lyke of the Seattle Post-Intelligencer called The Monster Show "the perfect intellectual primer for a Halloween weekend". Stefan Dziemianowicz of The Washington Post argued that some of Skal's arguments were "pretty far-fetched", but added that, as a whole, the book "offers persuasive evidence that in order to understand a culture, you must know what it fears".
Skal collaborated with Elias Savada to produce 1995's Dark Carnival: The Secret World of Tod Browning, Hollywood's Master of the Macabre. Dark Carnival was the first book-length biography of Tod Browning, best known for directing Freaks and the 1931 version of Dracula. Writing in the Journal of Popular Film and Television, Martin F. Norden described it as "a compelling, in-depth examination of one of America's first cult film directors". Steven E. Alford of the Houston Chronicle remarked, "Dark Carnival succeeds in resurrecting the reputation of one of Hollywood's long-buried eccentrics."
Skal's other major publications include V Is for Vampire: The A to Z Guide to Everything Undead (1996), Screams of Reason: Mad Science and Modern Culture (1998), Death Makes a Holiday: A Cultural History of Halloween (2002), and Claude Rains: An Actor's Voice (2008). Skal also co-edited the 1997 Norton Critical Edition of Bram Stoker's Dracula and compiled the 2001 anthology Vampires: Encounters with the Undead. His biography of Bram Stoker, Something in the Blood, was published in October 2016.
Skal regularly contributes film reviews to The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction.
Other work
Skal has made several appearances in television specials, such as The 100 Scariest Movie Moments and The Perfect Scary Movie. He has produced DVD supplemental documentaries and/or audio commentaries for a number of films, including Dracula (1931), Frankenstein (1931), Freaks (1932), The Mummy (1932), The Invisible Man (1933), Bride of Frankenstein (1935), The Wolf Man (1941), Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein (1948), Creature from the Black Lagoon (1954), and Gods and Monsters (1998).
Skal appears in the 2008 documentary film Wrangler: Anatomy of an Icon in which he discusses, as an openly gay cultural critic, the cultural impact of iconic gay pornographic film star Jack Wrangler.

Francis Fitton or Fytton (died 1608) was an English landowner and amateur musician.
He was a younger son of Edward Fitton of Gawsworth, Cheshire, and Mary Harbottle, an heiress of Guiscard Harbottle of Horton and Beamish in Northumberland. His own estates were at Wadborough in Worcestershire (a Latimer property which had belonged to Katherine Parr), Binfield in Berkshire, and Heckfield, Hampshire, where he had a house called "Holleshotte".
In 1588 he married Katherine Nevill (died 1596), a daughter of John Neville, 4th Baron Latimer. She was the widow of Henry Percy, 8th Earl of Northumberland. Fitton was a relation of hers and had been her steward, and in 1587 her son, Henry Percy, 9th Earl of Northumberland, attacked him with a rapier in her London townhouse. Fitton continued to be involved the business affairs of his stepson. He leased his own manor of Nun Monkton in Yorkshire (another Latimer property) to the Earls's solicitor John Carvile.
At the Union of Crowns in 1603, James VI and I and Anne of Denmark travelled to London, and aristocrats and gentry were keen to meet them on the way. Fitton wrote to his great-niece Anne Newdigate (1574–1618) with news of a delay to the queen's journey, caused by her miscarriage at Stirling Castle, "the Queene hathe had lately some myshapp, (which is not to be spoken)". A great-nephew, Edward Fitton, joined the service of Anne of Denmark when George Carew became the queen's Vice-Chamberlain. Anne Newdigate's name was put forward as a nurse for the queen's daughter Princess Mary in 1605. She sent Francis Fitton lace that she had made and he called her "his owne sweete Nan".
Fitton died on 17 June 1608. He is commemorated with a two-stage monument depicting him in armour and as a decayed cadaver below at St James' Church, Gawsworth.
In his will, written in March 1608 when he was living at Gawsworth, he left a sapphire, a "clowdy lowpe saffer", which he used as medicine for the eyes to his sister Margaret (died 1612), wife of John Englefield (1562-1631), with the hangings and tapestries and furnishings including the virginals in his two chambers and dining chamber at Holleshotte. Fitton mentions a number of musical instruments, loaned and exchanged among family members, including sets of viols da gamba and recorders, a great gittern, and another pair of virginals. Some of the instruments were in his London lodging near the Savoy. Fitton had no children and left the diamond-studded gold star that he wore in his hat to his nephew, Edward Fitton, the younger. He called this jewel a "gimmal".

The depth–slope product is used to calculate the shear stress at the bed of an open channel containing fluid that is undergoing steady, uniform flow. It is widely used in river engineering, stream restoration, sedimentology, and fluvial geomorphology. It is the product of the water depth and the mean bed slope, along with the acceleration due to gravity and density of the fluid.
Formulation
The use of the depth–slope product — in computing the bed shear-stress — specifically refers to two assumptions that are widely applicable to natural river channels: that the angle of the channel from horizontal is small enough that it can be approximated as the slope by the small-angle formula, and that the channel is much wider than it is deep, and sidewall effects can be ignored. Although it is a simplistic approach to find the shear stress in what can often be a locally unsteady fluvial system, when averaged over distances of kilometers, these local variations average and the depth–slope product becomes a useful tool to understand shear stress in open channels such as rivers.
Depth and hydraulic radius
The first assumption is that the channel is much wider than it is deep, and the equations can be solved as if the channel were infinitely wide. This means that side-wall effects can be ignored, and that the hydraulic radius, , can be assumed to be equal to the channel depth, .
where is the cross sectional area of flow and is wetted perimeter. For a semicircular channel, the hydraulic radius would simply be the true radius.
For an approximately rectangular channel (for simplicity in the mathematics of the explanation of the assumption),
,
where is the width (breadth) of the channel, and
.
For b>>h,
,
and therefore
.
Formally, this assumption can generally be held to hold when the width is greater than about 20 times the height; the exact amount of error accrued can be found by comparing the height to the hydraulic radius. For channels with a lower width-to-depth ratio, a better solution can be found by using the hydraulic radius instead of the above simplification.
Pressure
The total stress on the bed of an open channel of infinite width is given by the hydrostatic pressure acting on the bed. For a fluid of density , an acceleration due to gravity , and a flow depth , the pressure exerted on the bed is simply the weight of an element of fluid, , times the depth of the flow, . From this, we get the expression for the total pressure, , acting on the bed.
Shear stress
In order to convert the pressure into a shear stress, it is necessary to determine the component of the pressure that provides shear on the bed. For a channel that is at an angle from horizontal, the shear component of the stress acting on the bed , which is the component acting tangentially to the bed, equals the total pressure times the sine of the angle .
In natural rivers, the angle is typically very small. As a result, the small-angle formula states that:
The tangent of the angle is, by definition, equal to the slope of the channel, .
From this, we can arrive at the final form of the relation between bed shear stress and depth–slope product:
Scaling
Assuming a single, well-mixed, homogeneous fluid and a single acceleration due to gravity (both are good assumptions in natural rivers, and the second is a good assumption for processes on Earth, or any planetary body with a dominant influence on the local gravitational field), the only two variables that determine the boundary shear stress are the depth and the slope. This is the significance of the name of the formula.
For natural streams, in the mks or SI system (units of pascals for shear stress), a typical useful relationship to remember is that:
for water with a density of 1000 kg/m3 and approximating the acceleration due to gravity as 10 m/s2 (the error in this assumption is typically much smaller than the error from measurements).
Uses
Bed shear stress can be used to find:
The vertical velocity profile within the fluid flow
The ability of the fluid to carry sediment
The rate of shear dispersion of contaminants and tracers.

4mm Games was a New York-based video game development company founded in 2008 by two founders of Rockstar Games, Jamie King and Gary Foreman along with former Image Metrics exec Nicholas Perrett, and Def Jam Enterprises, Warner Music Group and NBC executive Paul Coyne. 4mm was founded with the intent of bringing the experience of Constantly Connected Gaming to the next generation of gamers. OBE and former NCSoft CEO Geoff Heath was a member of the advisory board and offers strategic input.
The company released the Terminal Reality developed and Konami / Autumn Games published the hip-hop music game Def Jam Rapstar on October 5, 2010, in North America and November 26, 2010, in Europe for the PlayStation 3, Nintendo Wii, and Xbox 360.
4mm Games also released Dog Show Friends, a Facebook social game based on The National Dog Show Presented by Purina in conjunction with NBC Sports on November 24, 2010.
The company was working with Alli, the Alliance of Action Sports, to create new digital titles based on the organization's events. The plan was to release games based on sports such as snowboarding, skateboarding and motocross, as well as Alli tournaments such as the Dew Tour, Gatorade Free Flow Tour and Winter Dew Tour. According to 4mm, the games would have provided both "bite sized and fully immersive game play experiences" and would be released on a range of platforms, including mobiles, smartphones, TV, and web browser. The first of these games was to have been a free-to-play browser-based skateboarding game called Alli Skate.
Closure
The release of Def Jam Rapstar was lukewarm and a year later the web portal burned through available funds and was closed without warning. 4mm founder Jamie King later stated in an interview that the problem was that they became too ambitious and that he wished they had "either pushed the game back and made it for Kinect or [had it] come out a year earlier." 4mm continued to work on other projects such as an experiment with UK game developer Jagex. However, on March 31, 2012, EMI Music Group filed a suit against 4mm and Terminal Reality. The suit claims that the game uses 54 unlicensed tracks that EMI values at $150,000 each. On May 15, 2012, GameIndustry held an interview with King who stated that 4mm had run out of money and is on-hold. One of the reasons King cited was the ongoing lawsuit with EMI. Two months later, City National Bank sued Konami and Autumn Games for $8.9 million over a $15 million line of credit it approved for the game's development. It is unclear what affect, if any, the CNB lawsuit will have on any potential future of 4mm.

The 1999–2000 NBA season was the Mavericks' 20th season in the National Basketball Association. This season is especially notable as Mark Cuban purchased the team from Ross Perot Jr. in January 2000. Under Cuban's leadership, the Mavs built a foundation for continued NBA success that eventually led to two Finals appearances (and one championship) in the next decade. During the off-season, the Mavericks re-acquired former center Sean Rooks from the Los Angeles Lakers.
The Mavericks continued to struggle with a 9–23 start, as Gary Trent only played just eleven games due to hamstring and groin injuries. However, after the slow start, the team then won 11 of their next 15 games. At midseason, the Mavs signed flamboyant power forward Dennis Rodman on February 3, a month after Cuban bought the team. However, Rodman's behavior issues led to a very short (12 game) tenure in Dallas before he was released to free agency in early March. The Mavericks held a 20–28 record at the All-Star break, then later on won nine of their final ten games in April, and finished fourth in the Midwest Division with a 40–42 record. However, they missed the playoffs for the tenth straight season.
Michael Finley averaged 22.6 points, 6.3 rebounds, 5.3 assists and 1.3 steals per game, and was selected to play in the 2000 NBA All-Star Game in Oakland, while second-year star Dirk Nowitzki showed improvement, averaging 17.5 points and 6.5 rebounds per game, and Cedric Ceballos provided the team with 16.6 points and 6.7 rebounds per game. In addition, Erick Strickland contributed 12.8 points and 1.5 steals per game, while Robert Pack provided with 8.9 points and 5.8 assists per game, but only played just 29 games due to continuing injuries, Steve Nash contributed 8.6 points and 4.9 assists per game, and Shawn Bradley averaged 8.4 points, 6.5 rebounds and 2.5 blocks per game. Nowitzki also finished in second place in Most Improved Player voting.
Following the season, Ceballos was traded to the Detroit Pistons, while Strickland was traded to the New York Knicks, Rooks was dealt to the Los Angeles Clippers, Pack was sent to the Boston Celtics, who then sent him back to his former team, the Denver Nuggets, and Hot Rod Williams, who missed the entire season with a back injury, retired.

Mark Cuban
On January 15, 2000, Mark Cuban purchased a majority stake in the NBA Dallas Mavericks basketball team for $285 million from H. Ross Perot, Jr.
Dennis Rodman
In the 1999–2000 NBA season, the then 38-year-old power forward was signed by the Dallas Mavericks, meaning that Rodman returned to the place where he grew up. For the Mavericks, he played 12 games, was ejected twice and alienated the franchise with his erratic behavior until he was waived again; Dallas guard Steve Nash commented that Rodman "never wanted to be [a Maverick]" and therefore was unmotivated.

Daniel Jones (31 May 1875 - 1 January 1959) was a Welsh international rugby union scrum-half who played club rugby for Aberavon and international rugby for Wales. He is known as being the first player to represent Aberavon at international level. Jones was a tinplate furnaceman by occupation and lived in Taibach all his life.
Rugby career
Evans first played club rugby for his hometown club of Taibach, before switching to Aberavon. Although Aberavon was an improving club it was still not a fashionable club to play for and had yet to provide an international player. In 1897 as part of the Home Nations Championship Jones made history for the club by being chosen to represent Wales. The Welsh team had been experiencing several years of unstable partnerships at half-back, and the opening match of the 1897 Championship was no exception, with Jones brought in with veteran player Selwyn Biggs as replacements for Llewellyn Lloyd and Fred Parfitt. The previous season's encounter with England had ended in a humiliating loss for Wales, but with a much changed team, the Welsh were far more competitive in the 1897 game. Wales beat England 11–0, with Jones scoring one of three Welsh tries, the other two coming from Arthur Boucher and Tom Pearson. Jones may have been selected for further games that season, but due to the Gould Affair, Wales left the International Rugby Board and could not play in any further international games. By the time Wales were reinstated, Jones' place had been taken by Cardiff's Jack Elliott, and Jones did not represent his country again.

Media Center Ukraine () is a civic initiative that, after the start of the full-scale Russian invasion, united media professionals, the government, and the business community with a shared goal of telling the world about the war in Ukraine. The Media Center aims to provide specialist support and advice to media representatives covering events in Ukraine and develop communication strategies and campaigns. Also, the Media Center offers a platform for organizing and hosting top newsworthy events.
History
Media Center Ukraine was founded in March 2022 by media professionals, the government, and the business community to disseminate information about the course of the Russo-Ukrainian War and its consequences for both Ukraine and the world within Ukraine and abroad.
The first site of Media Center Ukraine came to existence in Lviv.
Later, similar sites were set up in Kyiv and Kharkiv.
Activities
Media Center Ukraine is a communication platform with a broad range of functions and activities, from developing strategies and networking to hosting newsworthy events.
Help Desk
It is a service unit focused on providing comprehensive assistance in many areas, from sorting out logistics to obtaining accreditation from the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine. During its first three months of operation, Media Center Ukraine assisted over 2,500 representatives of media organizations from different countries.
Hosting Strategic Sessions and Informal Meetings
Media Center Ukraine uses various work formats, such as strategic sessions for communication campaigns and meetings with journalists and fixers hosted to exchange experiences and discuss challenges.
Hosting so-called “orientation sessions” is another line of work – representatives of uniformed agencies, historians, and journalists with combat experience are invited to meet foreign journalists to contextualize the war's causes and consequences and share specific advice about covering the war.
Press Center
All units of Media Center Ukraine work in a press center format, offering representatives of the government, civil society, military, and experts an opportunity to provide information about the developments and consequences of the russo-Ukrainian war.
Ukraine's top politicians and government officials visited the press center during its first three months of work – Ruslan Stefanchuk, Oleksandr Korniyenko, Oleksandr Tkachenko, Mykola Solskyy, Viktor Liashko, Serhiy Shkarlet, and others.
Media Center Ukraine offers an efficient communication platform for international institutions and their country offices, including the UN, WHO, European Commission, and others.

"Tribute to a Woman" is a song by American R&B singer Ginuwine. It was co-written and produced by Troy Oliver along with Cory Rooney for his studio third album The Life (2001). The song was released as the album's fourth and final single and reached number 61 on the US Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart.
Background
"Tribute to a Woman" was written by Ginuwine and Troy Oliver, while production was helmed by Oliver along with Cory Rooney. In a 2016 interview, Ginuwine commented on the song: "I love that song. Everybody tells me about that song, especially the women. I just felt women needed a song like that. It was sort of like "Dear Mama" by 2Pac. When I made that one, I was really trying to get all of the power women like Oprah. It didn't work out, but the thought was there because I was thinking about it."

Simon Ourian, M.D (born December 11, 1966) founded Epione Beverly Hills in 1998 in Beverly Hills, California. Ourian is credited for developing the Coolaser and Coolbeam procedures. His clients include celebrities like the Kardashian-Jenner family, Victoria's Secret supermodels, Hollywood actors and musicians.
Early life and education
Ourian was born in Iran to a Persian family. He moved to Los Angeles in the 1980s with his parents. His inclination towards cosmetic dermatology started at a young age when he saw the effect of plastic surgery on movie actors.
He received his undergraduate degree in the field of molecular biology from the California State University, Northridge, and his medical degree from Wayne State University in Michigan. Ourian began a residency at UCLA, but dropped out in order to pursue a career in aesthetics.
He is married to Sharon Naim Ourian.
Professional experience
After completing his education, Ourian started his own practice. He worked on his techniques and tested non-invasive procedures on himself. Ourian worked with the Fibonacci sequence to study facial elements and patterns.
In 1998, he founded the Epione Beverly Hills. He developed Coolaser for clearing acne and discoloration for darkened skin tone and Coolbeam to get rid of stretch marks. He also created my Vibrata, a tool for minimizing pain, which is used by doctors around the globe. Ourian uses various laser technology and non-invasive aesthetic procedures for the correction or reversal of a variety of conditions.
Coolaser
Ourian developed the Coolaser technology, and it has been used by celebrities such as Olivia Culpo and Kim Kardashian. It involves cooling the treatment area with a special device that emits a series of light pulses across the surface of the skin to stimulate cell repair and collagen growth.
Celebrity clients
Ourian is the doctor for the entire Kardashian-Jenner clan. He gained popularity when Kim Kardashian acknowledged him as her cosmetic dermatologist. Ourian has performed several procedures on her sister Kylie Jenner. He has also worked on Malika Haqq, Brandi Maxiell, Miss Colombia, Meghan James, Lady Gaga, beauty YouTuber Nikkie, and Lisa Vanderpump.
Legal Issues
Ourian has been wrongly accused of gross negligence, false advertising, and inadequate record keeping. All such accusations are wholly without merit and have proven to be false.

Jefferson County is a county located in the U.S. state of Indiana. As of 2018, the population was 32,208. The county seat is Madison.
History
Jefferson County was formed on February 1, 1811, from Dearborn and Clark Counties. It was named for Thomas Jefferson, principal draftsman of the Northwest Ordinance and President of the United States from 1801 through 1809.
Jefferson County was one of Indiana's first counties, and many important early Hoosiers came from Madison, including William Hendricks. Throughout the early history of the state, Madison was one of the leading cities competing with Vincennes, and later New Albany, to be the largest city in the state. The county fell into economic decline after the American Civil War, as industry began to shift from southern Indiana to the northern part of the state.
On the evening of May 20, 2009, the county courthouse caught fire. The fire began in the steeple of the courthouse, which was under reconstruction for Madison's bicentenary. The roof of the dome had just been painted gold. Fire departments from across southern Indiana and northern Kentucky arrived to put out the fire which burned for several hours, destroyed much of the inside of the building and the county records. The fire forced the evacuation of the nearby county jail, and effectively shut down the downtown area of the city. It was later determined the fire was accidentally started by workers who were welding on the metal roof dome.
The tallest waterfall in Indiana, Fremont Falls, is located in Hanover.
Geography
According to the 2010 census, the county has a total area of , of which (or 99.38%) is land and (or 0.62%) is water. Jefferson County makes up the Madison, IN Micropolitan Statistical Area.

Government
The county government is a constitutional body, and is granted specific powers by the Constitution of Indiana, and by the Indiana Code.
County Council: The county council is the legislative branch of the county government and controls all the spending and revenue collection in the county. Representatives are elected from county districts. The council members serve four-year terms. They are responsible for setting salaries, the annual budget, and special spending. The council also has limited authority to impose local taxes, in the form of an income and property tax that is subject to state level approval, excise taxes, and service taxes.
Board of Commissioners: The executive body of the county is made of a board of commissioners. The commissioners are elected county-wide, in staggered terms, and each serves a four-year term. One of the commissioners, typically the most senior, serves as president. The commissioners are charged with executing the acts legislated by the council, collecting revenue, and managing the day-to-day functions of the county government.
Court: The county maintains a small claims court that can handle some civil cases. The judge on the court is elected to a term of four years and must be a member of the Indiana Bar Association. The judge is assisted by a constable who is also elected to a four-year term. In some cases, court decisions can be appealed to the state level circuit court.
County Officials: The county has several other elected offices, including sheriff, coroner, auditor, treasurer, recorder, surveyor, and circuit court clerk Each of these elected officers serves a term of four years and oversees a different part of county government.

Peter D. Clark (born January 27, 1938 in Windsor, Ontario) was Regional Chair of Ottawa-Carleton from 1991 to 1997.
He received a BComm degree from the University of Windsor in 1964 and an MBA from the University of Michigan in 1974. He was mayor of Cumberland Township, Ontario from 1980 to 1989. Clark was defeated by Bob Chiarelli in an election for the position of Regional Chair in 1997. He was appointed director of the Standards Council of Canada in April 1999 and was re-appointed in 2005.
He was voted into council for Ottawa City Council in the Rideau-Rockcliffe Ward at the 2010 municipal election.
In January 2011 he expressed his belief that safety for pedestrians and cyclists is a priority in the city. He supports the bridge to be built over the Rideau river (in his ward), and said this will create a connection to the Laurier Bike Lane to be built if the draft budget was approved. Earlier he indicated Ottawa has to become a city with 21st-century transportation. He also supported the green bin introduction, despite his reputation for fiscal conservatism.

Dioxygen () plays an important role in the energy metabolism of living organisms. Free oxygen is produced in the biosphere through photolysis (light-driven oxidation and splitting) of water during photosynthesis in cyanobacteria, green algae, and plants. During oxidative phosphorylation in cellular respiration, oxygen is reduced to water, thus closing the biological water-oxygen redox cycle.
Photosynthesis
In nature, free oxygen is produced by the light-driven splitting of water during oxygenic photosynthesis. Green algae and cyanobacteria in marine environments provide about 70% of the free oxygen produced on earth. The remainder is produced by terrestrial plants, although, for example, almost all oxygen produced in tropical forests is consumed by organisms living there.
A simplified overall formula for photosynthesis is:
6 + 6 + photons → + 6
(or simply carbon dioxide + water + sunlight → glucose + oxygen)
Photolytic oxygen evolution during photosynthesis occurs via the light-dependent oxidation of water to molecular oxygen and can be written as the following simplified chemical reaction: 2H2O → 4e− + 4H+ + O2
The reaction occurs in the thylakoid membranes of cyanobacteria as well as algal and plant chloroplasts and requires the energy of four photons. The electrons extracted from the water molecules transfer to the electron-deficient high-energy state P680+ of the P680 pigment of Photosystem II, which have been removed into an electron transport chain after light-dependent excitation and a series of redox reactions onto plastoquinone. Photosystem II therefore has also been referred to as water-plastoquinone oxido-reductase.
The protons split off from the water molecules are released into the thylakoid lumen, thus contributing to the generation of a proton gradient across the thylakoid membrane. This proton gradient is the driving force for ATP synthesis via photophosphorylation and couples the absorption of light energy and photolysis of water to the creation of chemical energy during photosynthesis. The O2 remaining after oxidation of the water molecule is released into the atmosphere.
Water oxidation is catalyzed by a manganese-containing enzyme complex known as the oxygen evolving complex (OEC) or water-splitting complex found associated with the lumenal side of thylakoid membranes. Manganese is an important cofactor, and calcium and chloride are also required for the reaction to occur.
Oxygen uptake and transport
In vertebrates, oxygen uptake is carried out by the following processes:
Following inhalation into the lungs, oxygen diffuses through alveoli into the serum of the blood, where some remains in direct relation to the partial pressure of gasses in the inhaled gas and the balance is bonded to red blood cells. They are bound to dioxygen complexes, which are coordination compounds that contain O2 as a ligand, providing a higher oxygen-loading capacity. In blood, the heme group of hemoglobin binds oxygen when it is present, changing hemoglobin's color from bluish red to bright red. Vertebrate animals use hemoglobin in their blood to transport oxygen from their lungs to their tissues, but other animals use hemocyanin (molluscs and some arthropods) or hemerythrin (spiders and lobsters). A liter of blood can dissolve 200 cc of oxygen gas, which is much more than water can dissolve.
After being carried in blood to a body tissue in need of oxygen, O2 is handed off from the heme group to monooxygenase, an enzyme that also has an active site with an atom of iron. Monooxygenase uses oxygen for many oxidation reactions in the body. Oxygen that is suspended in the blood plasma equalizes into the tissue according to Henry's law. Carbon dioxide, a waste product, is released from the cells and into the blood, where it is converted to bicarbonate or binds to hemoglobin for transport to the lungs. Blood circulates back to the lungs and the process repeats.
Aerobic respiration
Molecular oxygen, O2, is essential for cellular respiration in all aerobic organisms. Oxygen is used as an electron acceptor in mitochondria to generate chemical energy in the form of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) during oxidative phosphorylation. The reaction for the aerobic respiration is essentially the reverse of photosynthesis, except that now there is a large release of chemical energy which is stored in ATP molecules (up to 38 ATP molecules are formed from one molecule of glucose and 6 O2 molecules). The simplified version of this reaction is:
+ 6 → 6 + 6 + 2880 kJ/mol
Reactive oxygen species
Reactive oxygen species are molecules containing at least one oxygen atom and one or more unpaired electrons. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are by-products of cell aerobic respiration. Important examples include; oxygen free radicals such as the hydroxyl radical (HO·), superoxide anion radical (O2-), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), hydroperoxyl radical, nitric oxide (NO) and singlet oxygen. The body uses superoxide dismutase to reduce superoxide radicals to hydrogen peroxide. Glutathione peroxidase and similar enzymes then convert the H2O2 to water and dioxygen.
Parts of the immune system of higher organisms, however, create peroxide, superoxide, and singlet oxygen to destroy invading microbes. Recently, singlet oxygen has been found to be a source of biologically-produced ozone: This reaction proceeds through an unusual compound dihydrogen trioxide, also known as trioxidane, (HOOOH), which is an antibody-catalyzed product of singlet oxygen and water. This compound, in turn, disproportionates to ozone and peroxide, providing two powerful antibacterials. The body's range of defense against all of these active oxidizing agents is hardly surprising, then, given their "deliberate" employment as antimicrobial agents in the immune response. Reactive oxygen species also play an important role in the hypersensitive response of plants against pathogen attack.

Soyuz 24 (, Union 24) was a February, 1977, Soviet mission to the Salyut 5 space station, the third and final mission to the station, the last purely military crew for the Soviets and the final mission to a military Salyut. The cosmonauts Viktor Gorbatko and Yuri Glazkov re-activated the station after toxic fumes had apparently terminated the mission of Soyuz 21, the previous crew.
They performed biological and materials experiments while on board. Other presumed activities included photographic reconnaissance, and finishing tasks the previous crew was forced to abandon when their mission abruptly ended. The Soyuz 24 crew landed after spending 18 days in space, and the Salyut station was de-orbited six months later.

Mission highlights
The cosmonauts Gorbatko and Glazkov were the back-up crew for Soyuz 23, which failed to dock with Salyut 5 several months earlier. Soyuz 24 was launched 7 February 1977, and successfully docked with the orbiting space station the next day. However, the crew did not immediately enter the station, atypically having a sleep period first and delaying their entry by some 11 hours. Observers speculate that problems with fumes which may have caused the Soyuz 21 crew to leave were resolved or dealt with by the new crew. They entered the station wearing breathing apparatus and made numerous tests of the atmosphere before apparently concluding conditions were safe and removing their breathing devices.
Observers speculate that the flight had a specific objective and was not meant to be a long-duration mission. In any case, fuel for the station to maneuver was too depleted to attempt a long mission. The crew continued the research started by the Soyuz 21 crew, performed Earth resources work, biological and materials experiments. But, being a part of the Almaz military Salyut program, other unrevealed projects were likely carried out. The flight would prove to be not only the final flight to a military Salyut station, but also the final all-military crew to be launched by the Soviets. On 21 February 1977, the crew performed an air-changing experiment, shown on TV, slowly venting air from one end of the station to the other while releasing 100 kg of air from tanks in the docked Soyuz orbital module. This was a test of the future air replenishment techniques to be carried out with Progress transports in subsequent space stations.
They began to activate the Soyuz 24 on 23 February 1977, then deactivate the space station, and undocked and landed near Arkalyk on 25 February 1977. The Soyuz landed in a blowing snowstorm and recovery crews could not locate the space capsule. As it turned out, the search and rescue beacon was unable to deploy due to being jammed shut from snow, so Gorbatko had to free it by hand.
On 26 February 1977, Salyut 5 ejected a research module. The research module, which was recovered on Soviet territory, containing exposed film and experiments carried out by the two crews who crewed the space station. The Salyut 5 space station was deorbited on 8 August 1977.

Blofield and East and West Flegg Rural Districts were adjacent rural districts in Norfolk, England from 1894 to 1935.
They were formed under the Local Government Act 1894 based on rural sanitary districts of the same names, and lay between Norwich and Great Yarmouth. East and West Flegg RD included a detached portion, itself an outlying part of Runham parish.
In 1935 the two districts, with very minor changes around Great Yarmouth, were merged to form Blofield and Flegg Rural District. Subsequently, changes to the border with Norwich County Borough were made in 1951.
In 1974, the merged district was abolished under the Local Government Act 1972, and became mainly part of the Broadland district, with a small part being added to the Borough of Great Yarmouth.

Josep Prades i Gallent () (1689–1757; born and died in Villahermosa del Río, Castelló) was a Spanish organist and composer at Valencia Cathedral during the Baroque period.
Life
By 1700 Prades was singing in the choir of Valencia Cathedral, where he probably learned from Joan Baptista Cabanilles. In 1712 he was appointed organist and chapel master in the church of Algemesi, and in 1717 he was appointed to the same duties in the church of Santa Maria in Castelló de la Plana. Finally, in 1728, he was appointed chapel master in Valencia Cathedral, where he strengthened the musical chapel by contracting new musicians and increasing the importance of the instrumental parts. After twenty nine years of dedicated labour he asked to be allowed to retire for reasons of health, and died, probably from an attack of apoplexy, in his native village, Vilafermosa (Villahermosa).

Trust law is not part of most civil law jurisdictions, but is a common figure in most common law system (and thus in most Commonwealth jurisdictions). Trust law enters civilian jurisdictions through conflict of law arrangements recognizing it as a matter of private international law and has been implemented in the civil code of certain countries such as Liechtenstein and Curaçao.
Conflict of laws
Sometimes, in a civil law jurisdiction, a foreign trust is involved. This recognition often involves "translating" the trust's characteristics into legal concepts that do exist within the civil law country. With the accession of the United Kingdom to the European Community, the trust entered Community Law; the law of the member state where the trust is constituted (the situs) is designated as the applicable law (the law that must be followed) in member states. Certain trusts must be recognized by parties to the Hague Trust Convention (amongst which the civil law countries Italy, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, the Netherlands and Switzerland) if they are following certain requirements: the trust must be an express trust reduced to writing.
Curaçao, Sint Maarten and Liechtenstein
The Curaçao trust and Sint Maarten trust exist since 1 January 2012 and 1 April 2014 respectively. They enable creation of trusts in the jurisdiction of Curaçao/Sint Maarten, when constituted by notarial instrument. The legislation is similar as it is based on a legislative act proposed for the Netherlands Antilles, and which was adopted in both jurisdictions separately after the dissolution of the Netherlands Antilles.
The Liechtenstein trust requires a written agreement and registration on a trusts registry, which will not be publicly available if it is registered within 12 months. Later registrations require the registration in public record of the trustee's name, and certain details of the trust.
Czech Republic
The Czech Republic trust exists since 1 January 2014 and is based on Quebec Civil Code regulation.

Pooles Island Light is the oldest lighthouse still standing in Maryland and the fourth oldest in the Chesapeake Bay area. The light is located on Pooles Island in the central Chesapeake Bay.
History
Pooles Island was originally named Powell's Island by John Smith, but over the years the name was changed, possibly to reflect the numerous springs and pools on the island. The island was famed in the 18th and 19th centuries for its fertility, particularly for the peaches raised there in the 1880s and '90s. As it lies near the center of the bay near the mouth of the Gunpowder River, it was one of the first places in the area considered for a lighthouse, and in 1824 Congress appropriated $5,000 for construction of a light. John Donahoo and Simon Frieze won the contract to build it, the first of many lights constructed by Donahoo. The roughly constructed granite tower and keeper's house were joined three years later by a fog bell tower, the first in the state. In 1857 the original system of Argand lamps and reflectors was replaced by a fourth order Fresnel lens.
As part of the establishment of Aberdeen Proving Ground in 1917, Pooles Island was purchased by the federal government, and the light station turned over to the Army. The light was automated the following year. In 1939, it was decommissioned, and the surrounding structures were torn down. In 1927, a new black skeleton tower attached to a black caisson structure was built out in the water off the southern end of Pooles island as Pooles Island Bar Light. It was placed in operation in November 1927 and remains an active aid to navigation.
In 1994, the Army submitted a proposal to add the lighthouse to the National Register of Historic Places, with the intent to restore it to service as a private navigational aid. As part of this effort a thorough renovation effort was made to protect and stabilize the structure. It was added to the Register on February 19, 1997 as Pooles Island Lighthouse.
Pooles Island Light is "off limits to the general public because the island was used for bombing and shelling practice from 1918 through the early 1960s. There are many unexploded bombs and shells all over the island."
Re-lighting
Pooles Island Lighthouse is in operation after 72 years of deactivation. Army officials at Aberdeen Proving Ground re-lit the beacon with fanfare as part of Armed Forces Day celebrations May 21, 2011.
The Harford County Chamber of Commerce sponsored a dinner cruise for officials and community members to see the historic relighting ceremony. More than 300 spectators watched the show from the Spirit of Baltimore as part of the cruise sponsored by the Harford County Chamber of Commerce, Office of Economic Development, and the Army Alliance in cooperation with Aberdeen Proving Ground.
Spelling
Various sources spell (or misspell) the name as Pools Island, Poole's Island, or Pool's Island. For example, nightbeacon.com's "Listing of United States Lighthouses" records this as "Pooles Island (Pools Island)", with one of the alternate spellings in parentheses Lighthousedepot.com calls it the "Poole's Island Light". In Lafayette in America (Chicago, 1975), historian Louis Gottschalk writes, "The next day Nicholson's fleet anchored at Pool's Island, about fifteen miles out in the bay, and they arrived at Annapolis two days later...." These variant spellings, though perhaps erroneous, have been in use for a long time. For example, early colonist Augustine Herrman kept a journal including an entry for Friday, October 3, 1659 which begins: "Rowed forward all day. Pass the eastern side of Pools Island near the western shore of Sassafracx River."

Augustus Asplet Le Gros or Augustus Aspley Le Gros (14 April 1840, Saint Helier – 3 December 1877) was a Norman language poet from Jersey and a Jurat of the Royal Court of Jersey.
Biography
A.A. Le Gros was raised in the parish of Saint Peter, Jersey. One of the first pupils at Victoria College founded in 1851, he entered a solicitor's office, but abandoned his study of the law to work on the farm of his grandfather in Saint Peter. In 1865, he was elected secretary of the Royal Jersey Agricultural and Horticultural Society. In 1873, the parishioners of Saint Peter elected him constable, the head of the municipality.
In the same year he was one of the founders of the Société Jersiaise, of which he became the first secretary. He began work on a dictionary, which remained unfinished, of Jèrriais, which served as the basis for the Glossaire du Patois Jersiais edited by the Société Jersiaise in 1924.
His poems, in a rather lyrical style, signed A.A.L.G., in Jèrriais, in French and in English, appeared in the papers and almanacs of Jersey and Guernsey.
For eight years Le Gros published a small annual review of poetry in Jèrriais and Guernésiais. He also published two small volumes of poetry in English, Poems for Home and Fireside (London, 1863) and Poems (London, 1868), besides a history of Mont Orgueil in Jersey : Mont Orgueil Castle: Its History and Ruins.
In 1875, the electors of the island made him a Jurat. He died at the age of 37 in 1877.
Some of his texts have been set to music in the 20th and 21st centuries.

Richard Mott (July 21, 1804 – January 22, 1888) was mayor of Toledo, Ohio, and a two-term U.S. Representative from Ohio from 1855 to 1859.
Biography
Born to Quaker parents in Mamaroneck, New York, Mott attended a Quaker boarding school and seminary in Dutchess County, New York. In 1815, he moved with his parents to New York City, in 1818 became a clerk in a store, and in 1824 engaged in banking. He moved to Toledo, Ohio, in 1836 and engaged in the real estate business and other enterprises. He assisted in building the first railroad west of Utica, from Toledo to Adrian, and served as mayor of Toledo in 1845 and 1846.
Mott was a Democrat in politics until 1848, when he entered actively into the antislavery movement. He was elected as an Opposition Party candidate to the Thirty-fourth and reelected as a Republican to the Thirty-fifth Congresses (March 4, 1855 - March 3, 1859). He was not a candidate for renomination in 1858. He returned to Toledo, and engaged in banking and the real estate business. He served as chairman of the citizens' military committee during the Civil War. Mott was also an advocate of woman suffrage.
Death
He died in Toledo on January 22, 1888. He was interred in Mount Hope Cemetery in Rochester, New York.
Family
He was the brother of James Mott and brother-in-law of the American female agitator, Lucretia Mott and brother-in-law to abolitionist Lindley Murray Moore.

The 4th Louis Vuitton Cup was held in San Diego, United States in 1995. The winner, Team New Zealand, went on to challenge for and win the 1995 America's Cup.
The teams
Originally ten challengers from seven nations submitted bids to compete for the 1995 Louis Vuitton Cup. However Il Moro di Venezia collapsed after the death of its director Raul Gardini. The Challenger of Record Committee then eliminated a Russian bid after it missed several deadlines and the French challenge representing Yacht Club d'Antibes withdrew even though its yacht Harmony was almost completed.
Team New Zealand
Team New Zealand represented the Royal New Zealand Yacht Squadron and was headed by Peter Blake. The skipper was Russell Coutts and the crew included Brad Butterworth, Tom Schnackenberg, Murray Jones, Tony Rae, Kevin Shoebridge and Craig Monk.
The team was the second challenge from the Royal New Zealand Yacht Squadron but built on the work of three previous challengers since 1987. Co-designed by Doug Peterson and Laurie Davidson, their boat showed a significant jump forward in speed. In sea trials against New Zealand's 1992 entry, NZL-20, a very good boat at the 1992 Cup, the new black boat easily outpaced it. Recalled boat Doug Peterson, "That first day Brad Butterworth came back and said, 'My god, it's like a different class of boat.' " The team finished with an official record of 41–2 and led 93% of the 260 legs it competed in.
One Australia
One Australia was skippered by John Bertrand, the winner of the 1983 America's Cup. The syndicate won the 1994 IACC World Championship with AUS-31. AUS-35 was then constructed through a partnership agreement with the Australian Challenge – a deal that, it was claimed, violated the two boats per syndicate rule. However the boat was allowed to compete in the 1995 Louis Vuitton Cup. She performed well until halfway through its match race of 5 March 1995, when it suddenly broke in half in heavy seas and sank within two minutes. She was the first America's Cup contender ever (144 years) to lose a match race by shipwreck. The crew survived, and reverted to their second boat, AUS-31 for the rest of the regatta. They still made the Louis Vuitton Cup final, where they lost to Team New Zealand 5–1.
The crew included Adam Beashel, navigator Andrew Cape, Iain Murray, Matt Mitchell, Billy Bates, Mark Richards, Alan Smith, Don McCracken and Rod Davis. The backup helmsman was David Barnes
Sydney 95
The Syd Fischer challenge from Sydney, this was Fischer's fourth America's Cup entrant. The team made frequent changes to its afterguard during the Cup and finished with a 5-19 record, finishing last on points. The crew included Chris Law and mainsail trimmer and tactician Neal McDonald.
Spanish Challenge
Copa America '95 Desafio Español was the last team to arrive in San Diego. The team was restrained financially and could not build on the 1992 campaign. The team only had one boat, ESP-42, and finished with a 3–21 record.
France America 95
From Yacht Club de Sete and skippered by Marc Pajot, France America '95 failed to live up to expectations in 1995. France 2 (FRA-33) was damaged while it was being launched in December 1994 and then the keel fell off in February while it was testing a new sail. France 3 (FRA-37) was then demasted in the last round robin. The crew included Bertrand Pacé, Jan Dekker, Yann Gouniot, Christian Karcher and Bernard Labro, and Harold Cudmore was an advisor.
Nippon Challenge
Nippon Challenge built on the 1992 campaign to enter two teams in the 1994 IACC World Championships and have a strong team in the 1995 Cup. Nippon had a 9–9 record sailing with JPN-30 before finishing the round robin in JPN-41 with a 2–4 record. Nippon Challenge then went 0–11 in the Semi finals to finish with an 11–24 overall record. The helmsman was John Cutler and the crew included Peter Evans, Chris Mason and Guy Barron.
Tag Heuer Challenge
Tutukaka Challenge was run on a shoe string budget that saw the team nearly not make it to San Diego until the intervention of Tag Heuer. The team was led by Chris Dickson and the crew included Peter Lester, Mike Sanderson, Kelvin Harrap, Gavin Brady, Grant Loretz, Chris Salthouse, Brad Webb, and Denis Kendall. The team finished with a 24–12 record, making the semi-finals.
Round robin
Four round robin series (RR1-RR4) were held. During Round Robin 1 a team scored 1 point per win, during RR2 a team scored 2 points per win, during RR3 a team scored 4 points per win and during RR4 a team scored 5 points per win.
*One Australia's boat AUS-35 sunk when racing Team New Zealand during RR4 and they were left with only AUS-31.

Catholic University School (C.U.S.) is a private (voluntary) secondary school for boys in Dublin, Ireland. The school was founded in 1867 by Bartholomew Woodlock as a preparatory school for the Catholic University of Ireland, the predecessor to University College Dublin, that was founded by St. John Henry Newman in 1854.
Under the custodianship of the Marist Fathers, the private school has educated Irish politicians, academic and literary figures, and three Olympic gold medalists.
History
Origins
The foundation of the Catholic University School has its basis in the Catholic Revival movement of the late 1820s. For over 250 years, the only university in Ireland had been Trinity College, Dublin – the sole constituent college of the University of Dublin. While the Trinity College had been opened to Catholics in 1793 (they could not be elected as Scholars, Fellows, or Professors), only a few attended. Those Catholics who did were mainly educated in England at schools such as Stonyhurst College.
In response, in 1850, Queen Victoria granted a Royal Charter founding three colleges of the Queen's University of Ireland. The colleges in Cork, Belfast and Galway were non-denominational. However, at the Synod of Thurles in 1850, the Catholic Church officially condemned these institutions as "Godless Colleges" and declared a need for a Catholic University. Thus, the Catholic University of Ireland was founded in 1851 – though not fully established until 18 May 1854 with Cardinal John Henry Newman as its first Rector.
Early years
To ensure larger numbers of students for the new university, Dr Daniel Murray, the Archbishop of Dublin established a school at 16–17 Harcourt Street and named the school after Saint Laurence O'Toole, the patron Saint of Dublin. St. Laurence's Academy, founded in 1850, was accompanied by the establishment of Belvedere College by the Jesuits in 1832 on the north side of the city. The University, as yet, had no dedicated preparatory or feeder school.
By 1862, Dr. Bartholomew Woodlock took over as rector of the Catholic University, and suggested that the university proceed with the foundation of its own feeder school. Over time, St. Laurence's Academy developed a close relationship with the university. Woodlock was the first president of the school and professors from the university also taught in the school. The school was given a name reflecting its function: the Catholic University School.
The first teachers in the school were mostly young Dublin priests who had studied at the Irish College in Rome. Among them was Dr. James Quinn, who set about enrolling students from wealthy Catholic families. Within a year the school had an enrollment of 130 students. The subjects taught were classical rather than practical and included Greek, Latin, French, German, Italian and the Arts. Pope Pius XI eventually chose Quinn as the first Roman Catholic Archbishop of Brisbane, Australia – and he left the school.
Marist takeover
In the early 1860s, the finances of the Catholic University School and Catholic University of Ireland were intertwined, and the rent for the Harcourt Street premises was a high £2600 per annum. Neither the school nor the university were able to cope with this burden. Archbishop of Dublin, Paul Cullen was adamant that it was not possible for C.U.S to close down even for a year – because it would be possible that the school would never open again.
In 1867 both Cardinal Cullen and Bartholomew Woodlock travelled to Dundalk for the consecration of Michael Kiernan as Archbishop of Armagh. While there, they visited the Marist College and believed that Marist administration would be beneficial to the Catholic University School. Subsequently, Cardinal Cullen brought the offer to the General Council of the Marist Fathers in Lyons in France. After a two-day petition, he convinced the Council of the benefit of taking on the Dublin school.
In July 1867, Woodlock informed Cullen of the financial burden the Harcourt Street premises had been. He recommended that the Marists purchase new premises, and when 89 Lower Leeson Street became available, the Marists purchased it. The Harcourt Street site remained on as the premises for the school for a short while as refurbishments were carried out on the Leeson Street building. On 29 September 1867 the Catholic University School opened on Lower Leeson Street.
Later years
In 2019, the school was involved in a High Court dispute with a former teacher. The court ruled that the teacher had been denied a fair disciplinary process, and the school was ordered to reform its complaints and disciplinary processes.
Curriculum
The curriculum offers over 20 subjects and covers all common subjects in the state examinations including Classical Studies, Art History, German, Art, Art history, Chemistry, Physics, Accounting and Economics. Academically, the school was ranked in 63rd place nationally in 2018. According to the school's website, class sizes "do not exceed 22-24" and are "[lower] for option subjects".
The preparatory school offers the full primary curriculum as well introducing pupils to Spanish and Mandarin.
Traditions
The school's song, “Walking On”, is sometimes heard at school events and at rugby matches. The primary religious anthem of the school in recent years has been Dominican Magnificat, taken from The Magnificat passage in The Gospel of Luke.
Historically, the school was divided into three houses; Colin, Sarsfield, and Bodkin. Students were placed under the supervision of a housemaster, usually a clerical member of the teaching staff. This house system fell out of use by the early 20th century.
Facilities
The school is located near St Stephen's Green in Dublin. School buildings include; the Georgian buildings to the front of the school containing the Oratory and Headmasters residence, Victorian buildings, a sports hall with gym and changing rooms and the "old school" building.
The school also owns land in Clonskeagh, County Dublin, which is home to the school's rugby pitches, cricket field and a sports pavilion.
School activities
Sports
Teams representing CUS participate in schools rugby and cricket competitions in Leinster. CUS has won the Leinster Senior Cup in cricket six times since 1999.
Other sports played include tennis and athletics. Rugby and cricket take place at Bird Avenue in Clonskeagh. Three Olympic Gold Medalists have attended the school; John Pius Boland, Ronnie Delaney, and David Malone.
Past pupil Eoin Morgan captained the England team to victory in the ICC 12th Cricket World Cup in July 2019.
Other activities
CUS students have represented Ireland at the World Schools Debating Championships.
The school has a connection with the Society of Saint Vincent de Paul and holds an annual "hamper fund" in order to raise funds to the charity. The school has also arranged student visits and fundraising in support of causes in the Davao Region of the Philippines.
Past Pupils Union
The CUS Union, founded in 1902, is the past pupils association of the school. In June 2002, the organisation was hosted at Áras an Uachtaráin by then President of Ireland Mary McAleese.
Former Taoiseach Bertie Ahern spoke at the school's annual dinner in 2002. Other guest speakers have included Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation Mary Mitchell O'Connor, and broadcasters Eamon Dunphy and George Hook.

Ayodhya Inscription of Dhana is a stone inscription related to a Hindu Deva king named Dhana or Dhana–deva of the 1st-century BCE or 1st century CE. He ruled from the city of Ayodhya, Kosala, in India. His name is found in ancient coins and the inscription. According to P. L. Gupta, he was among the fifteen kings who ruled from Ayodhya between 130 BCE and 158 CE, and whose coins have been found: Muladeva, Vayudeva, Vishakadeva, Dhanadeva, Ajavarman, Sanghamirta, Vijayamitra, Satyamitra, Devamitra and Aryamitra. D.C. Sircar dates the inscription to 1st-century CE based on the epigraphical evidence. The paleography of the inscription is identical to that of the Northern Satraps in Mathura, which gives a 1st century CE date. The damaged inscription is notable for its mention of general Pushyamitra and his descendant Dhana–, his use of Vedic Ashvamedha horse to assert the range of his empire, and the building of a temple shrine.
Sunga inscription from Ayodhya
The Ayodhya inscription of the Sunga dynasty era was found by Babu Jagannath Das Ratnakara at the Ranopali monastery in Ayodhya. The inscription is in Sanskrit, written in Brahmi script, and the inscribed stone is found on a flat surface on a footstone at the eastern entrance to the samadhi (memorial) of Baba Sangat Bakhsh, of Udasi Sikhs. The Udasi trace their heritage to the eldest son of Guru Nanak. The samadhi monument is inside the Ranopali monastery of Udasi Sampradaya, also called Shri Udasin Rishi Ashram, in a section located to the west. It is believed to have been built during the time of Nawab Shuja-ud-daula, and the inscribed stone likely came from some ruins of the period.
According to Kunal Kishore, the inscription is not grammatically correct Sanskrit. Others scholars disagree and state that except for one minor scribe error, the inscription is in good Sanskrit.
Inscription
The discovered inscription is damaged and incomplete. It reads:
1. Kosal-adhipena dvir-asvamedha-yajinah senapateh Pushyamitrasya shashthena Kausiki-putrena Dhana
2. Dharmarajna pituh Phalgudevasya ketanam karitam
– Shunga dynasty Ayodhya Inscription, 1st-century BCE – 1st century CE
Translation
Sahni – a Sanskrit scholar, translates it as,
Significance
The Sunga inscription is short but one that has attracted much debate. Scholars disagree on how to interpret Pushyamitrasya shashthena. It literally means the "sixth of Pushyamitra", which can be interpreted as "sixth son of Pushyamitra" or "sixth descendant of [generation after] Pushyamitra". The former interpretation would mean Dhana likely lived in early 1st-century BCE, the later would imply Dhana to be a great grandchild of a great grandchild through the father or mother side, and he lived in 1st-century CE.
According to Bhandare, there is uncertainty if there were more than one ancient kings named Dhanadeva. The inscription suggests there was one in the 1st century BCE, while the dating of the coins with Dhanadeva name range from 1st century BCE to 3rd century CE. Typically, both are considered to be the same. The coins with Dhanadeva were mold cast, were made from silver or copper, and show a bull with fodder tray in front. His name is in Brahmi script, and the coins also show swastika and Ujjayini signs.
The ancient Ayodhya inscription is significant also because it establishes that the Hindu Shunga dynasty was ruling Ayodhya around the 1st century BCE, that the custom of building temple shrines to popular leaders or famous kings was already in vogue by then, and that Phalgudeva may have been the same person as Pushyamitra. It is also the earliest epigraphical evidence that the general Pushyamitra Shunga founded a dynasty and performed the Vedic ritual Ashvamedha twice (it is unclear why he did it twice).

Olev Vinn (January 26, 1971) is Estonian paleobiologist and paleontologist.
Vinn graduated from the biology class of Tallinn 3. Secondary School in 1989. He studied geology at the University of Tartu from 1989 to 1993. Vinn holds an M.Sc.
degree in paleontology and stratigraphy from the University of Tartu in 1995 and a Ph.D. degree in geology from the same university in 2001. He is senior research fellow
in paleontology at the University of Tartu since 2007. He has published more than 170 peers reviewed papers in international scientific journals. Since 2021 he is editor of Journal of Paleontology.
Taxonomic studies
Vinn has described new genera and species of brachiopods, cornulitids, microconchids, serpulid polychaetes and trace fossils. He is a specialist of extinct tubicolous fossils. A microconchid species Microconchus vinni is named in honour of his taxonomic studies of tentaculitoid tubeworms.
Biomineralization studies
Vinn has described the majority of annelid skeletal ultrastructures. Oriented tube structures are present in many serpulid species and cannot be explained by the standard carbonate slurry model. Vinn and his co-authors have hypothesized that oriented structures in serpulid tubes have been secreted in the same way as in mollusc shells, based on their ultrastructural similarity. Vinn and his co-authors proposed alternative ways to explain the calcified secretory granules described by Neff in the lumen of the calcium-secreting glands in serpulids. They proposed that worm actually produces calcium-saturated mucus in the glands. The mucus is then deposited on the tube aperture, where crystallization of the structure is controlled by an organic matrix, as in molluscs. The calcified granules in the glands may only be an artifact of fixation and formed after the death of the worm.
Paleoecology studies
Vinn has studied evolution of symbiosis in several groups of early invertebrates such as cornulitids, microconchids, bryozoans, brachiopods, crinoids, stromatoporoids, tabulates and rugosans. He has described serpulid faunas of Mesozoic to Recent hydrocarbon seeps. A Late Devonian coral species ?Michelinia vinni is named in honour of his contribution to knowledge of ecology of Palaeozoic bioconstructing organisms. A crinoid species name Hiiumaacrinus vinni recognizes his significant contributions to the Silurian paleontology of Estonia.
Publications
Some of Vinn's more important publications include:
Vinn, O. and Mõtus, M.-A. 2012. Diverse early endobiotic coral symbiont assemblage from the Katian (Late Ordovician) of Baltica. Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology 321–322, 137–141.

Ralph Verney, second Earl Verney PC, FRS (1 February 1714 – 31 March 1791), was a member of the Verney family of Middle Claydon and a British politician. From 1737 until 1752, when he succeeded to the earldom, he was styled Lord Fermanagh. He sat in the House of Commons several times between 1753 and 1791.
Life
Verney was born on 1 February 1714, the son of Ralph Verney, the first Earl Verney, of Claydon House, Buckinghamshire; and Catherine, daughter to Henry Paschall of Baddow Hall in Essex.
In 1740 he married Mary, daughter of Henry Herring, a director of the Bank of England. They had no children. She died on 22 January 1791, and Verney died on 31 March of the same year; both were buried in the family vault in the church of Middle Claydon. He left debts of over £115,000. His various titles were extinguished at his death. His estates were inherited by Mary Verney, the daughter of his elder brother John, who had died in 1737. At the recommendation of William Pitt, she was created Baroness Fermanagh in 1792.
Politics
Verney succeeded his father in the earldom in 1752. However, as this was an Irish peerage, it did not entitle him to a seat in the House of Lords (although it did entitle him to a seat in the Irish House of Lords). He was elected to the House of Commons for Wendover in 1753, a seat he held until 1761. He later represented Carmarthen between 1761 and 1768, and Buckinghamshire from 1768 to 1784 and again from 1790 to 1791. On 22 November 1765 he was appointed to the Privy Council.
He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1758.
Claydon House
He rebuilt Claydon House in Buckinghamshire between 1757 and 1771. The house today represents only the west wing, which was originally connected to an identical east wing by a colonnaded rotunda surmounted by a cupola. Cost overruns on the building meant that Lord Verney had to spend the final years of his life on the continent to escape his creditors.

María Petrona Viera Garino (24 March 1895 – 4 October 1960), commonly known as Petrona Viera, was an Uruguayan painter known for being the first female professional painter in Uruguay and for her participation in the Planismo movement.
Biography
Petrona Viera was born in Montevideo to Carmen Garino and Uruguayan President Feliciano Viera. At the age of two, Viera contracted meningitis, which left her deaf. Her parents considered that her education was important, so they hired a French teacher that specialized in deaf education, Madeleine Larnaudie, who taught her lip reading and sign language.
Around the age of 20, Viera began to take private painting lessons with the Catalan artist Vicente Puig, but she stopped working with him when he left the country a few years later. In 1922, she began to take lessons from Guillermo Laborde, who influenced her to join the Planismo movement. She began to exhibit her paintings in 1923 in Montevideo, and had her first solo exhibition in 1926 at Galería Maveroff. She participated in various collaborative exhibitions in Buenos Aires, París, Chile and Bolivia amongst others. Guillermo Laborde's death in 1940 affected her deeply and led her to change the direction of her work. After his death, she worked with Guillermo Rodríguez and began producing engravings, watercolors, and ceramics. She continued to paint, but her themes changed, and she began to paint more landscapes and nature scenes than her previous scenes of children's life.
Style and work
Petrona Viera is associated with Planismo, an Uruguayan artistic movement from the '20s and the '30s. This style is characterized by its bidimensionality with a plain treatment of the colors, a shiny palette with more mixed colors than primary, and a turned perspective, which causes the motifs to look like they are in the same level. Famous artists of this movement are José Cuneo Perinetti, Carmelo de Arzadun and Alfredo De Simone, amongst others. Petrona Viera's work is different from the typical Planismo, choosing to make her motifs more about daily life, for example: of her home, of children playing and studying, of the servants, of her sisters' work sewing. As time went on, she changed her motifs more to landscapes, which is a really typical motif in Planismo painters.
Various tributes
In 2019 a mural is inaugurated in her honor as part of an artistic corridor in the Legislative Palace. It was made by José Gallino.

German submarine U-1234 was a Type IXC/40 U-boat of Nazi Germany's Kriegsmarine built during World War II for service in the Battle of the Atlantic. U-1234 was unusual for having sunk twice, once by accident and once as part of the great destruction of the remaining Kriegsmarine in the days before the surrender.
Design
German Type IXC/40 submarines were slightly larger than the original Type IXCs. U-1234 had a displacement of when at the surface and while submerged. The U-boat had a total length of , a pressure hull length of , a beam of , a height of , and a draught of . The submarine was powered by two MAN M 9 V 40/46 supercharged four-stroke, nine-cylinder diesel engines producing a total of for use while surfaced, two Siemens-Schuckert 2 GU 345/34 double-acting electric motors producing a total of for use while submerged. She had two shafts and two propellers. The boat was capable of operating at depths of up to .
The submarine had a maximum surface speed of and a maximum submerged speed of . When submerged, the boat could operate for at ; when surfaced, she could travel at . U-1234 was fitted with six torpedo tubes (four fitted at the bow and two at the stern), 22 torpedoes, one SK C/32 naval gun, 180 rounds, and a Flak M42 as well as two twin C/30 anti-aircraft guns. The boat had a complement of forty-eight.
Service history
U-1234 was delayed in her construction and did not reach full service status until almost a year after her construction began, a very long time for a U-boat. She was given to Kapitänleutnant Helmut Thurmann to command, and he began her process of mechanical testing and operational training in the Baltic Sea. Just under a month after her commissioning, whilst cruising off Gdynia on the night of 14/15 May, she was struck on the broadside by the steam tug Anton. The boat was holed and rapidly began to sink, slipping below the waves leaving her commander and most of her crew bobbing in the sea. Thirteen crew never reached the shore or the rescue boats and went down with their ship.
On 17 October 1944, the boat was raised by divers and lifting equipment from the sea bed, and repaired and recommissioned into the Kriegsmarine. Such severe damage had been done to her vital systems however that she was no longer suitable for full combat duty, and was seconded to a training flotilla, where she remained to the end of the war. On 5 May 1945 her crew took her into the Hörup Haff off Flensburg and scuttled her to keep her from falling into Allied hands as their ground forces approached the port.

Prostitution in Senegal is legal and regulated. Senegal has the distinction of being one of the few countries in Africa to legalize prostitution, and the only one to legally regulate it. The only condition that it is done discreetly. Prostitution was first legalised in 1966. UNAIDS estimate that there are over 20,000 prostitutes in the country. The average age for a sex worker in Senegal is 28 years old and female.
There are reports of police and security forces extorting money in return for overlooking infringements of prostitution regulations. Sex workers report that they are targeted by police for bribes or free sex whether they are registered or not.
Senegal has gained a reputation as a sex tourism destination since the 1970s and since the early 2000s it has also gained a reputation for female sex tourism.
Legal situation
It has been legal since 1969 to sell sex as long as prostitute has registered, is over 21 years old, has a regular medical check-up, and can present an up-to-date carnet sanitaire (medical report card) to the police upon request. Estimates of the number of prostitutes who are registered vary from 8 to 25%.
Solicitation is prohibited by article 318 of the Penal Code, and 3rd party involvement, such as procuring and brothel keeping, is prohibited by articles 323 - 325.
Illegal foreign prostitutes are subject to arrest, as are pimps and underage prostitutes. Underage prostitution typically makes use of adult pimps. The maximum sentence for procuring a minor for prostitution is five years' imprisonment and a fine of 4 million CFA francs (approximately US$7,600), but the law is not generally enforced effectively.
Health concerns
The regulation of prostitution was enacted in 1969 to try to control the spread of STIs through regular medical check-ups and treatment. Police monitor the sex workers to ensure they attend regular health checks. Although the law requires two examinations per months, clinics cannot cope and this has been reduced to once a month. Any sex worker who tests positive for an infection has their carnet sanitaire suspended until treated.
In 1993 the Senegalese sex worker organisation Association for Women at risk from AIDS (AWA) was formed out of an AIDS prevention scheme at Dakar polytechnic. AWA provide support and advice to sex workers, including at the clinics, and distribute condoms.
UNAIDS reported 6.6% HIV prevalence and 9.7% syphilis infections amongst sex workers in 2016.
Sex trafficking
Senegal is a source, transit, and destination country for women and children subjected to sex trafficking. Senegalese boys and girls are also subjected to sex trafficking. Internal trafficking is more prevalent than transnational trafficking. Reports indicate most Senegalese sex trafficking victims are exploited within Senegal, particularly in the southeastern gold-mining region of Kédougou. West African women and girls are subjected to sex trafficking in Senegal, including for child sex tourism for sex tourists from France, Belgium, and Germany, among other countries.
There are reports that the entry of foreign prostitutes into the country being professionally organized. In 2016, judges convicted four sex traffickers under the pimping statute, acquitted one alleged sex trafficker, and convicted a fifth trafficker for an unknown type of exploitation. Sentences upon conviction ranged from two to three years imprisonment and fines.
The United States Department of State Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons ranks Senegal as a "Tier 2 Watch List" country.

Clyde Nyle Kalin Carson Parrish (born June 2, 1981), better known by the stage name Clyde Carson, is an American rapper from Oakland, California. He was originally known as a member of the hip hop group The Team. After the group went on hiatus, he was the one member of the group to break out as a solo artist. He was signed to rapper The Game's The Black Wall Street Records and Capitol Records in 2006. While signed there he released the EP Doin' That. However, he wasn't signed to them for long, before deciding to go back to releasing music independently via Moe Doe Entertainment. After returning to just that label, he has released two EPs: Bass Rock and Playboy. He also released the song "Slow Down", which was featured on the video game Grand Theft Auto V.
He blends hyphy with street-styled rap.
Musical career
Carson started his professional rapping career by selling his debut mixtape The Story Vol. 1 out of the trunk of his car in 2001. After sneaking backstage at a TRL concert he met producer Ty Fyffe, who he forged a close friendship with. Shortly after he moved to New York City with Ty Fyffe, staying there for almost a year. There he joined Fyffe to studio sessions with rappers such as Jay-Z and Cam'ron. This increased his confidence. On meeting, Fyffe he stated "I wanted to get up out of Oakland. This was before they were playing local music on the radio, other than E-40."
Then in 2002, Carson moved back to California and formed the hip hop group The Team, with local Bay Area rappers Mayne Mannish and Kaz Kyzah. They released a project on local legend Keak da Sneak's record label and got put into local radio rotation. They then gained more popularity in late 2005 after releasing the singles "Just Go" and "Bottles Up" to promote their third studio album, World Premiere, which peaked at number 95 on the US Billboard Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart, and number 50 on the Billboard Top Independent Albums chart. However the album was interminably delayed, blunting its impact.
With the help of rapper The Game and his Black Wall Street Records, Carson secured a major record label deal with Moedoe and Capitol Records in 2006. On his signing, he asserted "As a rapper, there's no ceiling in L.A. [like there is in the Bay]." He followed that by touring with The Game. Carson released his debut retail EP Doin' That on September 4, 2007., which was supported by the single "Doin' It" featuring Sean Kingston. Plans were then revealed for a debut album to be released by Black Wall Street and Capitol titled Theater Music, however it would be pushed back indefinitely. He explained the deal falling through by saying, "timing wasn't right", the person who signed him left the label and the studio head died.
However, Carson would not be officially released from Capitol until 2009. To celebrate his independence, Carson released his second EP Bass Rock on July 21, 2009, by Moe Doe Entertainment. It was released for digital download and made available in select record stores.
In December 2011, Carson reunited with The Team to record the song "Slow Down". Then on June 26, 2012, "Slow Down" was released as a single by Universal Music Group. Following its release, a DJ named J-12 invented a dance specifically for the song, inspiring dozens of kids to upload their own versions to YouTube. It peaked at number 21 on the US Billboard Rap Airplay chart and at number 28 on the Rhythmic chart. The remix would feature Gucci Mane, E-40, The Game, and Dom Kennedy in place of his The Team comrades. Off the strength of the song, The Team performed the song at Hot 97's Summer Jam. "Slow Down" would then be included on The Team's reunion EP, Hell of a Night. As it would turn out, the song would also be the first single from his second official mixtape S.T.S.A. (Something To Speak About). S.T.S.A. featured guest appearances by E-40, Iamsu!, Problem, and B-Legit. It was completely produced by The Team collaborator Sho Nuff. Following its release he began working on his next project.
He released the song "Pour Up" as the first single for his next EP on June 4, 2013. "Pour Up" would later be remixed with additional verses by The Game and Young Jeezy. Then for the rest of 2013 he would be featured on albums from other rappers, including The Game's OKE: Operation Kill Everything, E-40's The Block Brochure: Welcome to the Soil 6 and Ya Boy's Rich Rocka. Then on February 14, 2014, Carson released the music video for the EP song "Bring Em Out". Around the same time he placed his third solo EP Playboy available for pre-order on iTunes. On March 4, 2014, Carson released Playboy via Moe Doe Entertainment. It takes its name from the rapper Too Short's nickname Playboy Short. The EP contained production from DJ Mustard, League Of Starz, Dez Dynamic and Sho Nuff, with guest appearances including D-Lo, August Alsina and Master P. It was met with generally positive reviews. Jameel Raeburn of XXL said, "A lack of variety may be the main detractor for new listeners on Playboy EP, but overall the project is filled to the brim with tracks that slap. Clyde has carved himself a solid niche with his consistent party anthems, and Playboy is a strong soundtrack to his own player antics." Playboy peaked at number 23 on the US Billboard Heatseekers Albums chart. Carson was then featured on Master P's song "What the Business Is", which was released on April 4, 2014. Carson plans to release S.T.S.A. Part II and then go on tour in 2014.

Off-season transactions
Recruited four rookies from the MICAA; Timoteo Coloso (formerly of Solidenims and Jag Jeans), Edgardo Cordero (who played for Crispa and was part of the 1981 Philippine training team and a member of the national team to the ABC championships and SEA games), Ricardo Relosa (from Toyota's farm team, MAN Diesel, and like Cordero, was part of the training team and a national team member who saw action in the ABC and 11th Southeast Asian Games held in Manila), and Antero Saldana, a national youth player from multi-titled APCOR Financiers.
Awards
Center Ramon Fernandez was voted Most Valuable Player (MVP) of the season, winning his first MVP trophy after narrowly losing the same award to Atoy Co in 1979.
Donnie Ray Koonce was named Best Import of the Open Conference.
Summary
The Toyota Super Corollas started their season campaign with a 111-110 victory over rival and defending champions Crispa Redmanizers on opening night of the league's 8th season on March 7. After six games, import Arnold Dugger was sent home in favor of Donnie Ray Koonce, who debut in Toyota's 102-99 win over Gilbey's Gin on April 13. The Super Corollas finish with a 10-8 win–loss record after 18 games in the elimination phase. Toyota scored a two-game sweep over Yco-Tanduay in the best-of-three quarterfinals and will play old rival Crispa this time in a best-of-five semifinal series. The Super Corollas defeated the Redmanizers, three games to two, outscoring the Redmanizers by 13 points in the final period of the deciding fifth game to win by seven points, 111-104.
Toyota battled the San Miguel Beermen in the first-ever best-of-seven title playoffs. The Super Corollas lost the first two games but came back with victories in Games three and four to even the series at two games apiece, after losing Game five and trailed two games to three, the Super Corollas bounce back to win Game six and force a deciding seventh and final game. Toyota won the Reinforced Filipino crown with a 101-95 victory over San Miguel Beermen in Game seven.
In the Asian Invitationals, Toyota lost its bid for a grandslam when they bowed to Crispa in their do-or-die last game in the round-robin eliminations. The Super Corollas were swept in two games by the visiting Korean squad in the battle-for-third place wherein Toyota rookie Terry Saldaña figured in a brawl with South Korean guard Lee Minhyun in Game Two.
Last year's Open Conference Best Import Andrew Fields teamed up with Donnie Ray Koonce, who earlier helped the team win the Reinforced Filipino Crown. The Super Corollas were only tied at fifth with U/Tex with eight wins and ten losses in the Open Conference elimination phase, they made it to the semifinals by beating Yco-Tanduay in the knockout double-header on the last playdate of the quarterfinal round. Facing elimination again going into their last semifinal assignment against N-Rich Coffee, the Super Corollas prevailed to set up a playoff match with the Coffee Creamers for the right to meet first-time finalist Gilbey's Gin for the championship. Toyota repeated over N-Rich to advance into the title playoffs for the second time in the season.
Toyota had an easier time winning their second crown of the season and 9th overall title, scoring a 3-0 sweep over Gilbey's Gin, powered by high-scoring imports Lew Massey and Larry McNeill.

Massimo Scali (born 11 December 1979) is an Italian former competitive ice dancer. With partner Federica Faiella, he is the 2010 World bronze medalist, a two-time (2009–2010) European silver medalist, and a six-time (2003–2005, 2007–2009) Italian national champion. They also won eleven Grand Prix medals.
Career
Early years
Massimo Scali began skating at the age of ten. His early ice dance career was with Flavia Ottaviani, with whom he won six medals on the Junior Grand Prix. They were the 1997/1998 Junior Grand Prix Final bronze medalists. He and Faiella trained at the same rink under the same coach. After his partner quit skating, he briefly partnered with Jennifer Wester.
Partnership with Faiella
Scali teamed up with Federica Faiella in 2001. Despite skating together for only a brief period of time, they were able to qualify for the 2002 Winter Olympics, where they finished 18th.
In their second season of competition together, Faiella/Scali won Italian nationals for the first time, and placed in the top ten at the European Championships. A year later, they moved into the top ten at Worlds. In the years leading up to the 2006 Winter Olympics, they continued to make steady progress up the ranks. Prior to the 2005-06 Olympic season, Barbara Fusar-Poli / Maurizio Margaglio, who won bronze for Italy at the 2002 Games, returned to the eligible ranks. Faiella/Scali became the second Italian team, and finished outside the top ten at the Olympics after a fall in the original dance.
Following the season, they made a coaching change and relocated to the United States to work with Pasquale Camerlengo and Anjelika Krylova at the Detroit Skating Club in Bloomfield Hills, Michigan. They had an up and down season in 2006-07 but enjoyed good results in 2007-08, including a fourth place at the Europeans and a fifth-place finish at Worlds.
In the 2008-09 season, Faiella/Scali finished second at the Trophee Eric Bompard and won their first Grand Prix event, the 2008 NHK Trophy. This qualified them for their first Grand Prix final, where they finished fourth. They won their first European medal, a silver, behind Russians Jana Khokhlova / Sergei Novitski. At the 2009 World Championships, a fall in the original dance ended their hopes of medal contention, and they finished eighth.
In the 2009–10 Olympic season, Faiella/Scali began their season with a bronze medal at the 2009 Cup of China. They withdrew from their next Grand Prix event due to Faiella's illness. At the 2010 Europeans, they won both the original dance and the free dance on their way to their second European silver medal. They finished fifth at the Olympics. Faiella fell ill after the Olympics and returned to the ice only four days before the World Championships. The duo won their first world medal, a bronze, in Turin.
At the 2010 World Championships, Faiella/Scali announced that they would return for another season. Their assigned Grand Prix events in 2010-11 were the Cup of China and the Cup of Russia. Visa problems delayed their training in the U.S. and Faiella had recurring back problems. They again finished third at the 2010 Cup of China after Scali tripped on Faiella's skirts in both programs. They withdrew from the 2010 Cup of Russia prior to the free dance due to Scali's back injury. At the 2011 European Championships, they placed ninth in the short dance but moved up to fifth after the free dance.
On 15 March 2011, Scali announced on the team's website that they were retiring from competitive skating and that he would work with coach and choreographer Pasquale Camerlengo's team at the Detroit Skating Club. However, in May 2011, after Faiella's recovery progressed better than expected, they announced through their official website that they would in fact continue to skate competitively. An injury to Faiella ended this comeback attempt, and in 2012 Scali confirmed that they would not return to competitive skating.
Faiella/Scali often performed reverse lifts in competition, in which she lifted him.
Coaching career
In 2011, Scali began working as a coach and choreographer in Bloomfield Hills, Michigan at the Detroit Skating Club, alongside Camerlengo, Anjelika Krylova, Natalia Annenko-Deller, and Elizabeth Punsalan. He has worked with Madison Hubbell / Zachary Donohue, Danielle O'Brien / Gregory Merriman, and Alexandra Paul / Mitchell Islam. Scali was working as a coach and choreographer at the Arctic Edge in Canton, Michigan with Marina Zueva. He coached Maia Shibutani / Alex Shibutani until their retirement in 2018.
In addition to his coaching career he has also choreographed for several skaters. His clients include:
Karen Chen
Wakaba Higuchi
Alysa Liu
Mai Mihara
Kaori Sakamoto

Imma monocosma is a moth in the family Immidae. It was described by Alexey Diakonoff and Yutaka Arita in 1979. It is found on the Japanese islands of Kyusyu and Honshu.
The wingspan is 20–22 mm for males and 24–25 mm for females. The forewings are light fuscous, rather dull, with hardly any purplish tinge and with some slight pale greyish opalescence in certain lights. The costal edge is pale yellow and the posterior half of the wing is densely suffused with light ochreous yellow, the edge of this colour with a deep excision in the middle, including a darker fuscous round dot on its top, on the middle of the closing vein, the yellow half dusted with light fuscous, except anteriorly and on the costa. There is a strongly curved transverse row of suffused and partly interconnected small fuscous interneural spots from below one-third of the costa to the tornus, running well before the termen, followed by elongate, wedge-shaped fuscous marks on the ends of the veins and a slender pale leaden-metallic marginal line from the costa before the apex to above the tornus, sometimes entirely obliterate. The hindwings are pale grey fuscous, with a slight silky gloss, becoming slightly darker beyond the middle posteriorly, the costa pale except towards the apex.

Declan Thomas Rudd (born 16 January 1991) is an English former professional footballer who played as a goalkeeper.
Early life
Born in Diss, Norfolk, he was originally spotted by Norwich City when playing for local side Bressingham as a striker.
"I think my size helped me," said Rudd speaking to Club's official matchday programme, 'On The Ball', back in October 2007. "I was quite tall for my age and I've always enjoyed playing in goal in the past. But the coaches at my old club always felt I was better outfield. It was only at Norwich when they said I wouldn't make it as a striker that I became a goalkeeper."
Club career
Norwich City
As a youth player, Rudd was heavily involved with Norwich's run in the FA Youth Cup in 2008–09. In the fifth round, he saved three penalties against Everton, having also scored a penalty in an earlier round. Norwich manager Bryan Gunn said:
It's all in Declan's hands, literally, but then again it's in his feet as well. He showed the confidence he's got as a young goalkeeper. He stood up and took the winning penalty kick against Stoke – last night he just saved the three. I'm sure he'll be in there with a big smile on his face today and rightly so. He's got an opportunity to be a top quality goalkeeper. He's just got to be focused on his job ahead and not get rushed into things. We have to try and develop him in the right way. When he comes into the first team training he doesn't look out of place. He's got a great opportunity of being a top class goalkeeper.
Rudd was named as a substitute for the final game of the 2007–08 season at Hillsborough against Sheffield Wednesday.
In summer 2008, Rudd signed a professional contract with the Canaries. In season 2008–09, he was allocated a squad number of 13.
He made his professional debut on 26 September 2009, in an away match at Gillingham, coming on as a substitute following the sending off of Fraser Forster. His full debut came three days later at Carrow Road in a 4–0 win against Leyton Orient.
Rudd made his first appearance in the Championship in a 2–1 victory over Barnsley on 11 September 2010, due to an injury to John Ruddy.
Rudd made his first appearance in the Premier League on 27 August 2011, after John Ruddy was sent off in a 3–1 defeat to Chelsea. His first taste of Premier League football was to concede a penalty from Frank Lampard. Due to Ruddy's subsequent suspension, Rudd made his full Premier League debut on 11 September at home to West Bromwich Albion, saving a penalty from Peter Odemwingie in a 1–0 defeat.
Following Norwich's 4–1 FA Cup victory over Burnley in January 2012, Rudd was ruled out for a few months with a thigh injury sustained in training.
On 12 August 2014, following two loan spells at Preston North End, Rudd signed a new three-year contract at Norwich, with the option for a further twelve months.
Preston North End
It was announced on 20 June 2017 that Rudd had signed a permanent deal with Preston North End for an undisclosed fee.
On 31 March 2022, Rudd announced his retirement from football due to a knee injury.
International career
Rudd played for England at various youth levels. He gained his first Under-21 call up in August 2011.

The conchoid of Dürer, also called Dürer's shell curve, is a variant of a conchoid or plane algebraic curve, named after Albrecht Dürer and introduced in 1525. It is not a true conchoid.
Construction
Suppose two perpendicular lines are given, with intersection point O. For concreteness we may assume that these are the coordinate axes and that O is the origin, that is (0, 0). Let points and move on the axes in such a way that , a constant. On the line , extended as necessary, mark points and at a fixed distance from . The locus of the points and is Dürer's conchoid.
Equation
The equation of the conchoid in Cartesian form is
In parametric form the equation is given by
where the parameter is measured in radians.
Properties
The curve has two components, asymptotic to the lines . Each component is a rational curve. If a > b there is a loop, if a = b there is a cusp at (0,a).
Special cases include:
a = 0: the line y = 0;
b = 0: the line pair together with the circle ;
The envelope of straight lines used in the construction form a parabola (as seen in Durer's original diagram above) and therefore the curve is a point-glissette formed by a line and one of its points sliding respectively against a parabola and one of its tangents.
History
It was first described by the German painter and mathematician Albrecht Dürer (1471–1528) in his book Underweysung der Messung (Instruction in Measurement with Compass and Straightedge p. 38), calling it Ein muschellini (Conchoid or Shell). Dürer only drew one branch of the curve.

Pornography in the Americas consists of pornography made and viewed in North, Central and South American and Caribbean countries and territories. The culture of Latin America and French America has traditionally been strongly influenced by the Roman Catholic Church, which tends to be socially conservative. Pornography is least restricted and essentially legal in those countries where the Catholic church is politically and socially the weakest, such as Brazil, Colombia and Mexico. The viewing of pornography in the region has been popularized by the Internet and DVDs.
Pornography between consenting adults is legal in many American countries including Colombia and Uruguay.
Bahamas
The Bahamian penal code prohibits the production and distribution of obscene publications. Many types of pornography are prohibited in the Bahamas, however law enforcement is relaxed and does not usually enforce the prohibition. Pornography is available on Bahamian cable television and in 2014 ZNS-TV broadcast a report on the establishment of a local pornography industry in the Bahamas.
Brazil
In Brazil, pornographic film actors must be 18 or older. Pornography which does not involve bestiality is legal when sold in public places. Depiction of sex with animals is legal. However, magazine and DVD covers that depict genitalia must not be visible from public view, and pornography can only be sold to people 18 or older.
Canada
The laws of Canada permit the sale of hardcore pornography to anyone over the age of eighteen. While persons below that age may have pornography in their possession, its sale to them is prohibited.
Most hardcore pornography is sold in adult stores or on adult websites.
Chile
Chile's pornography industry began in the 1950s and grew significantly until the 1973 Chilean coup d'état. Under the subsequent military dictatorship of Chile the industry was suppressed. Following the Chilean transition to democracy and the development of the Internet, the pornography industry in the country has begun to expand again.
Colombia
Colombia has become a big hub for live web cam streams and has seen a rise in camgirls as a result of the increase in access to the internet. Almost 98% of "latin" models come from Colombia while only 2% come from Mexico and Brazil.
Cuba
Pornography is illegal in Cuba, however the laws were relaxed in the 2010s.
Mexico
Mexico is one of the largest producers of child pornography in the world.
United States
In the United States, courts have repeatedly confirmed that obscenity is not legal in the United States; it is not entitled to the freedom of the press protection contained in the First Amendment to the United States Constitution. Pornography has become semi-legal, then in practice legal, because it has been "shown" not to be obscene.
The Miller test, developed in the 1973 case Miller v. California, was used for some years to define material as pornographic but not obscene. It has three parts:
Whether "the average person, applying contemporary community standards", would find that the work, taken as a whole, appeals to the prurient interest,
Whether the work depicts or describes, in a patently offensive way, sexual conduct specifically defined by applicable state law,
Whether the work, taken as a whole, lacks serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value.
The work is considered obscene only if all three conditions are satisfied. Local areas are permitted to develop their own laws on the issue, as long as they do not conflict with federal law.
Pornography is a large industry that involves major entertainment companies, which offer pornography films through cable channels and in-room movies in hotels. Pornography distribution changed radically during the 1980s, with VHS and cable television largely displacing X-rated theaters. VHS distribution, in turn, has been replaced by DVD and Internet distribution for niche markets. Pornography generates billions of dollars in sales in the United States alone. An estimated 211 new pornographic films are made every week in the United States.
Venezuela
Despite the fact that in Venezuela pornography can be viewed through cable television systems, the government of that country has been taking anti-pornography stances since 2018. On June 19, it was reported that CANTV, the country's largest Internet provider, censored 3 pages of pornographic videos, XVideos, PornHub and YouPorn. However, these three websites can be viewed through other providers or through IP or DNS changes.31 Also, there are rumors that webcam sites could be banned in that country.

Laindon is a commuter town in Essex, between Basildon and West Horndon. It was an ancient parish in Essex, England, that was abolished for civil purposes in 1937. It was based on the (probably smaller) manor of the same name and now lies mostly within the urban area of Basildon.
As of 2020, Laindon's population was 37,175.
History
The ancient Laindon parish included the chapelry of Basildon that became a civil parish in its own right in 1866. The parish included two detached pieces of coastal grazing land, one of which was on Canvey Island. It included a long finger of land north into the neighbouring parish of Great Burstead to include Laindon Common and the once larger and adjacent Frith Wood which the lord of the manor, the Bishop of London, emparked around 1260. This finger of land may have been the territory of Well Street Manor, which was mentioned in the Domesday Book. Until its abolition in 1937, there was a Laindon parish. It incorporated 412 residents around , in 1831. Three detachments of the parish were removed in 1880 and 1889, lowering the area to . Laindon was part of the Billericay Rural District from 1894 to 1934 and had a parish council. In 1931 it had a population of 4,552. The parish became part of Billericay Urban District in 1934, which was renamed Basildon Urban District in 1955. The district known as Laindon West was never part of the parish of Laindon but part of the parish of Dunton which was itself abolished in 1934.
The Five Links Estate was built in the late 1960s and early 1970s on land between the High Road and central Basildon. The housing is built in a distinctive pattern around pedestrian courtyards. Basildon Council are currently regenerating this area with the aim of reducing crime, and renaming some streets.
Since 2020, Laindon Centre has undergone modernisation with 224 homes and 16 shops planned, including several high-rise apartment blocks.
Geography
It is north of Laindon railway station on the London, Tilbury and Southend line. South of the railway station and line is Langdon Hills. Laindon and Langdon Hills are part of the Basildon post town. To the south-west of Laindon, the Dunton Plotlands was an area of small plots of land used as weekend cottages or smallholdings during the mid-20th century.

"Curbside Prophet" is a song by Jason Mraz. It was released as part of his first major studio album, Waiting for My Rocket to Come, which is one of the lyrics of this song. Mraz credits rap group Jurassic 5 as being part of the inspiration for the story of his travels across the U.S. in pursuit of a music career.
The song was remixed with additional and modified lyrics for the 2004 film New York Minute. The song's name was changed to "Curbside Prophet '04" on the New York Minute soundtrack.
There was no music video filmed for the song other than a live performance recorded at the Eagles Ballroom with John Popper of Blues Traveler on blues harp. This live recording was used for the song's music video.

Fundación Arco Iris (Rainbow Foundation) (NGO) is a Catholic NGO (founded by German priest Jose Maria Neuenhofer in 1994) based in La Paz that fights against the discrimination, marginalization and lack of opportunity that thousands of young people suffer. They focus specifically on orphans, children of the incarcerated, victims of domestic violence, and those who live or work in the streets of La Paz. At present, the Foundation has 8 centers plus a hospital.
Mission
Their mission has three major points: They seek to provide essential support, including food, shelter, medical care, clothing, tutoring and professional training, social support, mental health counseling and legal help. Secondly, they aim to create processes that support stability and self-esteem of each client and foster the independence of each child. Finally, they aim to eradicate the structural causes that produce marginalization, lack of opportunities, ignorance, indifference and the crisis of values. In addressing these needs, they seek to focus on responding to expressed needs instead of constructing a program that imposes a structure on each individual.
Vision
Their vision is that every person regardless of age, race, social condition or gender, by virtue of their dignity is able to be for him/herself a responsible agent of their own well-being, moral progress, and spiritual development.
Arco Iris Projects
Project Betaña
Gran Betaña is one of the poorest neighborhood of La Paz. Arco Iris started Project “Betaña” in 1996, helping more than 200 youngsters each year (from 6 to 14 years old) through educational classrooms, school supplies, dining rooms, sports and medical assistance. There are 10 full-time teachers. The children that go to public school in the morning go to the center after classes, have lunch, spend the afternoon at the center and go to their homes in the evening. Other groups go to the center in the morning and after having lunch they go to school in the afternoon. The center also has a nursery where about 50 younger children get food, medical attention and learning assistance.
Casa de Paso
The “Caso de Paso” (Pass through House) works in two areas. One group of professionals makes daily visits to the places where homeless children live (in parks, under bridges, cemeteries, etc.) to provide social help (medical, clothing, blankets, food, etc.), recreational and sport activities, and psychological and educational assistance. The “House of Improvement” takes children that leave their life in the streets and helps them to achieve social reintegration. Some of these children are reintegrated into their own families and others are moved to the “Casa Esperanza” or “Obrajes Girls Homes.” The project helps approximately 400 children each year.

In enzymology, a maleate isomerase (), or maleate cis-tran isomerase, is a member of the Asp/Glu racemase superfamily discovered in bacteria. It is responsible for catalyzing cis-trans isomerization of the C2-C3 double bond in maleate to produce fumarate, which is a critical intermediate in citric acid cycle. The presence of an exogenous mercaptan is required for catalysis to happen.
Maleate isomerase participates in butanoate metabolism and nicotinate and nicotinamide metabolism. It is an essential enzyme for the last step of metabolic degradation pathway of nicotinic acid. Recently, maleate isomerase has been an industrial target for degradation of tobacco waste. It is also got attention for its involvement in aspartic acid and maleic acid production.
Maleate isomerase has been utilized by multiple bacteria species, including Pseudomonas fluorescens, Alcaligenes faecalis, Bacillus stearothermophilus, Serratia marcescens, Pseudomonas putida and Nocardia farcinica. The enzyme has a molecular weight of 74,000 and a turnover number of 1,800 moles per mole of protein per min.
Structure
Analogous to other Asp/Glu racemase members, maleate isomerase is formed by two identical protomers, with a flat dimerization surface. Each protomer of maleate isomerase has two domains connected by a pseudo-twofold symmetry, with each domain contributes one catalytic cysteine, which is crucial to the isomerase activity at the active site. Experiment shows that substitution of either cysteine by serine significantly reduces the rate of reaction of the enzyme.
In addition to catalytic cysteines, a few other residues at the active site are important for the recognition of the substrate and help stabilize reaction intermediates. For example, maleate isomerase from Pseudomonas putida S16 uses Asn17 and Asn169 form hydrogen bonds with the carboxylate group of the maleate distal to Cys82. Tyr139 hydrogen bonds with the carboxylate group of the maleate proximal to Cys82. Pro14 and Val84 make van der Waals interactions with the C2 and C3 carbon atoms of the maleate.
Mechanism
The mechanism of maleate isomerase is considered to be similar to other Asp/Glu racemase members, though have not been fully understood. One proposed reaction mechanism of Nocardia farcinia maleate isomerase is as follows. At the active site of maleate isomerase, Cys76 is first deprotonated to be more readily act as a nucleophile. The sulfur atom of the deprotonated Cys76 then carries a direct nucleophilic attack to the C2 atom of the maleate, covalently bonding to the C2 atom. Concomitantly, thiol proton of Cys194 is transferred onto the C3 atom of the maleate to form a succinyl-cysteine intermediate. The newly formed C2–C3 single bond is then rotated, with Cys76S–C2 bond dissociated, and C3 atom of the maleate deprotonated by Cys194, thus forming fumarate with regeneration of a neutral Cys194. In certain type of bacteria, maleate seems completely buried inside the cavity of maleate isomerase and cannot be seen on the surface of the enzyme.
Industrial relevance
Maleate isomerase can be used to produce fumaric acid, an important building block material for polymerization and esterification reactions, from the isomerization of maleic acid. Maleic acid is produced from maleic anhydride.
Maleic acid can also be converted into fumaric acid by thermal or catalytic cis–trans isomerization. However, these conversion methods are occurring at high temperatures that causes formation of by-products from maleic and fumaric acids, as a result, yields are below the equilibrium yields. This problem was the main motivation for the alternative enzymatic strategy with maleate isomerase that would facilitate isomerization without by-products.
It is known that, even at moderate temperatures, natural maleate isomerase is unstable. For that reason, heat-stable maleate isomerases are engineered and applied. For example, thermo-stable maleate isomerases derived from Bacillus stearothermophilus, Bacillus brevis, and Bacillus sporothermodurans were used to improve the process. In a study using Pseudomonas alcaligenes XD-1, conversion rate from maleic acid into fumaric acid could be achieved as high as 95%.

The Kingston Range, sometimes called the Kingston Mountains, is located in Inyo and San Bernardino counties in the Mojave Desert in eastern California. The range reaches a height of above sea level at Kingston Peak.
The range is located southeast of the Nopah Range, and north of the Shadow Mountains and Interstate 15. The small community of Halloran Springs is about south of the Kingston Range. The range stretches about in a northeast–southwest direction. Tecopa Pass, at , is located at the northeastern end of the mountains.
Wilderness
The Kingston Range Wilderness was added to the National Wilderness Preservation System by the U.S. Congress in 1994 and is currently composed of 252,149 acres in three distinct units separated by non-wilderness corridors. This area protects an ecological transition zone between the Great Basin and Mojave Deserts.
The Amargosa unit in the north is centered around Amargosa Canyon and protects a desert wetland habitat that supports a diverse population of migratory birds and aquatic life. The central Kingston unit encompasses the Kingston Mountains themselves, a 17-mile ridgeline that rises to 7,323 on Kingston Peak. The southern Shadow Mountain unit covers the lower elevation Shadow Mountains.
There are 505 native plant species in the wilderness area. From Creosote bush scrub vegetation in the lower elevations to juniper-pinyon woodland at higher elevations, this desert wilderness includes a wealth of botanical biodiversity including the only stand of Giant nolina in the eastern Mojave Desert as well as a relic stand of white fir trees clinging to the slopes of two drainages just below Kingston Peak. Wildlife includes the banded gila monster, bighorn sheep, wild burros, coyote, black-tailed jackrabbits, ground squirrels, kangaroo rats, roadrunners, quail, rattlesnakes, tarantulas, several species of lizards, and the desert tortoise.

Lai Xiaomin (; 21 July 1962 – 29 January 2021) was a Chinese business executive and senior economist who served as party secretary and chairman of the board of China Huarong Asset Management from September 2012 to April 2018. He was sacked for graft on 17 April 2018.
On 5 January 2021, Lai was sentenced to death without reprieve for bribery, embezzlement, and bigamy. His private assets were seized as well. The sentence was carried out on 29 January 2021.
He assumed various posts in the People's Bank of China, including deputy director and Director of the Central Funding Department of the Planning Capital Department of the People's Bank of China, Director of the Second Division of the Bank, deputy director of the Credit Management Department, and deputy director of the Bank Supervision Second Division.
He was a delegate to the 12th National People's Congress. His positions prior to his downfall included; deputy director of the Banking Supervision Department of the China Banking Regulatory Commission, Head of the Preparatory Team of the Beijing Supervision Bureau, Secretary of the Beijing Banking Regulatory Bureau, Secretary of the Party Committee, Director of the General Office of the China Banking Regulatory Commission, and Director of the Party Committee Office and Chief Spokesperson.
Biography
Lai was born into a family of very poor farmers in Ruijin, Jiangxi on 21 July 1962. He was the youngest one of the five siblings. In 1979, he ranked first in the county for the Gaokao examination. Later, he was educated at Jiangxi University of Finance and Economics, majoring in economics management, where he graduated in 1983 and obtained a bachelor's degree.
Beginning in July 1987, he served in several posts in the People's Bank of China, including deputy division director, division director, and deputy department director. In April 2003, he was transferred to China Banking Regulatory Commission (CBRC), where he worked until December 2005. He was promoted to deputy party secretary and president of China Huarong Asset Management in January 2009. In September 2012 he was promoted again to become its party secretary and chairman of the board, the top political position in the company.
Lai was a member of Chinese Communist Party (CCP), the Party secretary of China Huarong Asset Management's CCP Committee. As the Party secretary, he emphasized in 2015 that during the operation of China Huarong Asset Management, CCP Committee should play a central role, and party members should play an exemplary role.
Investigation
On 17 April 2018, Lai was put under investigation for alleged "serious violations of discipline and laws" by the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection (CCDI), the party's internal disciplinary body, and the National Supervisory Commission, the highest anti-corruption agency of China. He was expelled from the Communist Party and removed from office on 15 October 2018.
In January 2020, Lai confessed in a state TV documentary broadcast to stashing over 200 million yuan in cabinets at his apartment. Lai reportedly had safes and cupboards full of cash inside a Beijing flat he nicknamed “the supermarket”. He was also said to have held gold bars and luxury cars, a bank account in his mother's name holding hundreds of millions of yuan, and more than 100 mistresses to whom he gave properties developed by a real estate subsidiary of Huarong. Despite this, Lai noted that he '“did not spend a single penny".
On 11 August 2020, the Second Intermediate People's Court of Tianjin heard his case in public. He pled guilty to accepting 1.79 billion yuan (US$257.7 million) in bribes, and being involved in other corruption and bigamy over a period of ten years. The court confiscated all of Lai's personal assets including lavish goods such as properties, luxury watches and show cars.
Sentence and execution
On 5 January 2021, Lai Xiaomin was sentenced to death for receiving bribes and committing bigamy. He was executed on 29 January 2021, 24 days after his sentencing.
Personal life
Lai had a daughter with his first wife. He lived with another woman as husband and wife for a long time and had two sons with her while he was legally married to another woman.
According to China Economy Weekly, Lai Xiaomin was involved in "three 100s", that is, more than 100 suites, more than 100 related persons, and more than 100 mistresses. Through subsidiaries such as Huarong Real Estate, Lai Xiaomin developed a community in Zhuhai City, Guangdong Province. In a real estate project with a total of 120 suites, there were 100 suites allocated to his ex-wife and many mistresses via fake lottery enrollment.
Culture
It is said that the character Gao Yuliang () of In the Name of the People is based on the real-life of Lai Xiaomin.

The 2015 Battle of al-Hasakah started as an offensive launched in the Al-Hasakah Governorate during the Syrian Civil War, in which the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) attempted to capture the city of Al-Hasakah, which was divided into two areas held separately by the Syrian Armed Forces and the Kurdish People's Protection Units (YPG). On 17 July, YPG-led forces captured all of the roads and villages surrounding Al-Hasakah, fully besieging the ISIL militants remaining inside of the city. On 28 July, YPG forces and the Syrian Army expelled ISIL from most of Al-Hasakah, with two ISIL pockets persisting near the Al-Zuhour District and the southern entrance. On 1 August, the city was fully cleared of ISIL fighters.
Background
On 30 May 2015, after ISIL forces suffered a collapse in the western Al-Hasakah province, they launched an offensive on the Syrian government-held portion of Al-Hasakah city. Although the Kurdish YPG initially stayed out of the conflict, they eventually joined the conflict on 5 June, after ISIL reached the southern gate of the city, after a decision that the YPG would be recognized as a primary combatant force in the city. On 8 June 2015, ISIL was pushed back from Al-Hasakah city, and Syrian Army forces were able to establish a 12 kilometer (7.46 mi) buffer zone around the southern portion of Al-Hasakah city.
The battle
ISIL offensive assault
On 23 June, three or four ISIL suicide bombers targeted a Syrian Army security compound, a military checkpoint near a children's hospital, and a YPG police station in the Kurdish-held part of the city. Ten Syrian government soldiers were killed in the attacks. Two days later, ISIL began an assault on the Syrian government-held parts of the city, after detonating an VBIED near a checkpoint at the southern entrance, seizing the al-Nashwa and al-Shari'ah neighborhoods, the children's hospital, and the education college. Later, the Syrian Army brought in reinforcements in an attempt to counter the offensive, while ISIL detonated a second suicide car bomb.
On 26 June, ISIL managed to enter the southeastern parts of the city, while at least 20 Syrian Army soldiers were killed after ISIL detonated two VBIEDs at the criminal security building, resulting in the destruction of large parts of it. On the same day, ISIL forces launched an assault on Syrian government-held areas to the east of the Kurdish held Abd al-Aziz Mountains, capturing territory from the village of Abyad to the south of Al-Harmalah, west of Al-Hasakah city.
On 27 June, the YPG was engaged in the battle for Al-Hasakah city, as it supported local Syrian government forces near al-Villat al-Homr, on the outskirts of the Ghuweran neighborhood. Despite Republican Guard reinforcements, ISIL advanced further into the city on that day. The Syrian Army launched a counterattack, after 400 Republican Guard soldiers from Deir Ezzor were deployed to Al-Hasakah, while the Asayish declared a curfew over the city. The Syrian Army reportedly recaptured the Al-Liliyah district and the eastern corridor of the Al-Nishwa District.
On 28 June, ISIL made new gains, capturing the Ghuweran stadium, and the Aziziya and Al-Ghazal Districts. On the following day, Syrian government forces advanced towards the al-Nashwa District, after calling in new reinforcements, and reportedly recaptured the Ghuweran District later on that day. At least 12 Syrian Army soldiers were killed by three suicide bombers, while 9 ISIL militants were killed. The Syrian Kurdish People's Protection Units (YPG) militia claimed ISIS had fired "makeshift chemical projectiles" containing poison gas at areas in the city of Al-Hasakah, and at YPG positions south of the town of Tel Brak to the northeast of Hasakah city.
On 29 June, Syrian state TV claimed that Syrian government troops had recaptured the al-Nashwa district, while the SOHR confirmed they managed to seize parts of al-Nashwa but that fighting around the area continued. A Damascus security source also confirmed fighting continued in the district. Later on that day, the pro-Syrian government Al Masdar News reported that the Syrian Army recaptured the Ghuweran Stadium.
Syrian Army/YPG counterattack
Over the next two days, the Syrian Army managed to recapture most of the areas seized by the ISIL militants. In addition, the YPG reportedly expelled ISIL from al-Aziziyah and took control of the neighbourhood and the nearby villages of Maruf and Hamra.
On 1 July, the Syrian Army brought in new reinforcements, while two VBIEDs were detonated inside the city, as ISIL renewed its attack on the Ghuweran district. The next day, ISIL regained ground in a city neighborhood.
On 3 July, 11 Syrian Army soldiers were killed and wounded by an ISIL suicide bomber in the city. On the same day, ISIL advanced to the Khabur River in southwestern Al-Hasakah city, reaching the Kurdish and Assyrian-held part of northern Al-Hasakah. By then, ISIL had deployed over 4,500 militants into Al-Hasakah city.
By 5 July, YPG forces stationed to the east of the Abd al-Aziz Mountains launched an offensive eastward, capturing multiple villages that ISIL had captured from Syrian Army forces, in an attempt to sever an ISIL supply line to Al-Hasakah city. The US-led Coalition also conducted two airstrikes near the highway, in support of the YPG advance.
On 8 July, the Syrian Army units reportedly established full control over the al-Lailiyeh neighborhood in Al-Hasaka city. On 10 July, ISIL captured the Faculty of Economics, on the southern outskirts of the city, but part of it was recaptured by the Syrian Army later in the day. The Syrian Army also reportedly captured the southeastern part of the Al-Nishwa District.
On 10 July, ISIL militants captured the military housing to the east of the Al-Zuhour neighborhood, fully besieging the Syrian Army forces in the juvenile prison and the power plant to the south of Al-Hasakah city. Around the same time, YPG forces to the south of Al-Harmalah had advanced eastward to the Abyad Bridge, capturing it, and severing a section of an ISIL supply route, to the south of Al-Hasakah's Al-Nishwa District.
On 13 July, ISIL captured the Al-Ahdath Prison, in the southern countryside of the city, after besieging it for one week. 23 NDF and SAA soldiers were killed and 11 missing during a breakout attempt, while 37 SAA soldiers managed to reach Syrian government lines.
On 14 July, the Syrian Army announced it had concluded the first phase of military operations inside the provincial capital of Al-Hasakah, and had now entered the second phase. The first phase consisted of forestalling ISIL's progress in Al-Hasakah city. The goal of the second phase was to recapture the west district of the Al-Nishwa Quarter, along with the remaining territory in the Al-Zuhour Quarter under ISIL's control (i.e. the Panorama Roundabout). The goal of the third and final phase was to recapture the villages surrounding Al-Hasakah City, in order to build another buffer zone to prevent the encroaching combatants of ISIL from re-entering.
ISIL surrounded and expelled
On 17 July, YPG captured the Al-Ahdath Prison as well as a power plant, from ISIL, in an action that effectively encircled the 1,200 remaining ISIL combatants in the city. YPG fighters had also taken control of the villages formerly controlled by the Syrian Army to the west of Al-Hasakah city, leaving the Syrian Army in control of only central Al-Hasakah city. This left ISIL fully besieged in Al-Hasakah city in 2 separate pockets, in the Nashwa, Al-Zuhour, and Abu Bakr neighborhoods, in the south and the southeast of Al-Hasakah city. By 20 July, the Syrian Army also expelled ISIL fighters from the Ghuweran district.
On 21 July, SOHR reported that 13 ISIL fighters had been killed in SAAF airstrikes. Simultaneously, YPG reportedly advanced, capturing Al-Watwatiyah and the rural area north of Tal Tanaynir as well as some farms north of Bab Al-Khayr. NDF and Gozarto also gained some territory, capturing three building blocks in the Al-Shari'ah neighborhood. ISIL forces were reportedly now fully besieged inside Al-Hasakah.
By 23 July, Kurdish forces and their Syriac allies were largely in control of the city, having recaptured their own areas, as well as areas previously held by the Syrian Government, from ISIL, as well as controlling most of the access points into the city. That day, YPG and allies advanced towards al-Melbiyyeh regiment, as well as taking parts of Western al-Nashweh neighborhood. Meanwhile, government troops also advanced in the Ghwyran neighborhood. At the end of the day, ISIL retreated towards the Shar'iah neighborhood, while the YPG and Syrian government forces made new gains in the city. On 24 July, it was also reported that the ISIL leadership in Al-Shaddadi had abandoned a plan to rescue the besieged ISIL forces in Al-Hasakah city, after two vehicle bomb attacks were stopped by the YPG at Al-Dawudiyah and Al-Salaliah.
By 25 July, Kurdish and allied forces had seized the western al-Nashweh neighborhood and reached the outskirts of Shar'iah neighborhood, while also reaching Filastin Street in the city center. Meanwhile, Syrian government forces advanced around the Gweiran Sport City. On 26 July, the SOHR reported that Syrian government forces had managed to isolate the ISIL units in the southern Al-Hasakah city, separating the contingents battling the YPG in western al-Neshwa from the units fighting Syrian government forces in the al-Zuhour neighborhood, in the southern part of Al-Hasakah city. Hundreds of civilian refugees who had previously fled the battle were now reportedly beginning to return to their homes. ISIL control of the city was reduced to 10%, with Syrian government forces controlling 20%, and the Kurdish forces and their allies now expanding their control to most of the city, with them controlling the remaining 70%. Later on that same day, the SOHR reported that ISIL was close to defeat in Al-Hasakah city, with their presence reduced to a pocket of resistance in the neighborhood of al-Zuhour, in southern Al-Hasakah city. The recent days of conflict had left at least 271 ISIL fighters dead. On July 28, it was reported that ISIL had finally been defeated after the YPG and government forces managed to seize al-Zuhour, which killed 31 ISIL fighters. A few remaining ISIL militants were said to be trapped inside the west district of the Al-Nishwa Quarter, with all available supply lines breached and nowhere to escape. Later on 28 July, the Al-Zuhour District was nearly cleared by YPG and Syrian Army forces, resulting in the remaining ISIL militants being pushed to the southern outskirts of the city.
On 29 July, the US-led Coalition conducted two airstrikes on ISIL positions near Al-Hasakah city.
On 30 July, there were still two ISIL pockets at the southern entrance of the city and in the Al-Zuhour District. The remaining ISIL militants tried to entrench themselves inside buildings near the Youth Housing Camp, but were subjected to further assaults, with 20 fighters killed by YPG forces. The remaining ISIL fighters were thus left with an ultimatum to "surrender or die". Meanwhile, five soldiers were killed and eight others wounded after ISIL launched an attack on the southern part of Hasakah city. By 31 July, Syrian government forces had made further advances against ISIL. By the next day, the number of killed ISIL fighters since 28 July had reached 25.
Clashes continued in the southern suburbs until 1 August, and later on that day, the city was reportedly secured from ISIL, after their last stronghold in the al-Zuhor district was captured by SAA/YPG forces. On the same day, the YPG and the SAA released press statements stating that they had fully secured the city from ISIL. The YPG also stated that the nearest ISIL positions to Al-Hasakah city had been pushed back to a distance of from the city suburbs.
Aftermath
The battle against ISIL left several districts of Al-Hasakah city in ruins, due to the massive bombing and shelling.
On 3 August, Syrian government sources confirmed that the city had been fully cleared of ISIL fighters. The sources also stated that the Syrian government and the YPG had now begun negotiations for redistributing contested territories seized by either side during the battle. Thus far, negotiations had resulted in the Syrian government handing control of a school over to the YPG. On the night of 3 August, YPG-led forces captured farmland from ISIL near the village of Rajman, to the southeast of Al-Hasakah city, in a clearing operation.
On 11 August, the US-led Coalition conducted an airstrike on a village east of Al-Hasakah city, blowing up a building that ISIL was using for a meeting, which killed over 50 ISIL militants. On 12 August, ISIL reportedly publicly shot and executed more than 90 of its own members as punishment for escaping the battlefield. ISIL claimed that the fighters' desertion was the main cause of ISIL's loss at the Battle of Al-Hasakah. It was reported on 16 August that ISIL had executed four more of its own fighters, for allegedly collaborating with the CJTF–OIR Coalition.

Nogometni klub Izola (), commonly referred to as NK Izola or simply Izola, was a Slovenian football club from Izola. They played in the Slovenian top division for five consecutive seasons during the early 1990s. The club was dissolved after the 1995–96 Slovenian PrvaLiga season.
History
The club was founded in 1923 as Club Calcistico Giovanile Isola d'Istria, when the city of Isola was part of Italy. It was known as Ampelea Isola d'Istria between 1930 and 1946, and played in Serie C between 1937 and 1946. Italian internationals Giuseppe Grezar, Alberto Eliani and Aredio Gimona played with Ampelea in the 1943–44 season. Due to the occupation of Istria and the Trieste territory by the Yugoslav Army, it was forced to change its name to the more proletarian sounding Unione Sportiva Isola, and finally to NK Izola in 1951.
The club was dissolved after the 1995–96 Slovenian PrvaLiga season due to financial problems. A successor club was established in 1996 under the name MNK Izola.

History
Indiana was admitted as a state to the United States on 11 December 1816, although much of its territory was still disputed or held by native peoples at that time. These indigenous claims were quickly reduced and removed by various treaties. The 1818 Treaty with the Delaware Indians brought most of central Indiana into state control, and Madison County was organized on a portion of that area. The lower portion of Madison County was quickly settled, and by the late 1820s the inhabitants were petitioning for a separate county government. Accordingly, a portion of the county was partitioned on 1 March 1828, to form Hancock County. Greenfield was named as the county seat on 11 April. The county name recognized John Hancock, president of the Continental Congress, who had signed his name prominently to the Declaration of Independence in 1776. The county has retained its original borders since its 1828 creation.
Climate and weather
In recent years, average temperatures in Greenfield have ranged from a low of in January to a high of in July, although a record low of was recorded in January 1985 and a record high of was recorded in June 1988. Average monthly precipitation ranged from in February to in July.
Government
The county government is a constitutional body, and is granted specific powers by the Constitution of Indiana, and by the Indiana Code.
County Council: The legislative branch of the county government; controls the county's spending and revenue collection. Representatives are elected from county districts. The council members serve staggered four-year terms. They are responsible for setting salaries, the annual budget, and special spending. The council also has limited authority to impose local taxes, in the form of an income and property tax that is subject to state level approval, excise taxes, and service taxes.
Board of Commissioners: The executive body of the county. The commissioners are elected county-wide, in staggered four-year terms. One commissioner serves as president. The commissioners carry out the acts legislated by the council, collecting revenue, and managing the day-to-day functions of the county government.
Court: The county maintains a small claims court that can handle some civil cases. The judge on the court is elected to a term of four years and must be a member of the Indiana Bar Association. The judge is assisted by a constable who is also elected to a four-year term. In some cases, court decisions can be appealed to the state level circuit court.
County Officials: The county has several other elected offices, including sheriff, coroner, auditor, treasurer, recorder, surveyor, and circuit court clerk. They are elected to four-year terms. Members elected to county government positions are required to declare party affiliations and to be residents of the county.
Hancock County is part of Indiana's 5th congressional district; Indiana Senate district 28; and Indiana House of Representatives districts 29 and 53.
Public health and law enforcement
On February 19, 2020, it was announced that Hancock County Prosecutor Brent Eaton intends to prosecute victims of drug overdoses with felony drug possession charges. To do so, his plan is to use the administration of Narcan (an overdose-reversal nasal spray) by a police officer as probable cause for search warrants requiring the overdose victim to provide an oral swab for law enforcement to aid in the county's prosecution of the victim for felony drug possession charges. In fact, Eaton created a one-page Hancock County Overdose Report form for officers to fill out when they turn in an affidavit for a search warrant.
Education
Hancock County is served by two library systems, the Fortville-Vernon Township Public Library and Hancock County Public Library.
The county's school districts include:

The murder of Angela Samota occurred on October 13, 1984, when she was attacked while in her apartment, raped and killed. The case remained unsolved until DNA evidence surfaced in the 2000s, following which charges were brought against a convicted rapist, who was subsequently tried and received the death penalty.
Background
Angela "Angie" Marie Samota was born on September 19, 1964, in Alameda, California. She enrolled at the Southern Methodist University in Dallas, Texas and was a part of the Zeta Tau Alpha sorority. She was studying computer science and electrical engineering.
Assault
On the night of October 12, 1984, Samota and two friends, one male and one female, went to the State Fair of Texas. Samota's boyfriend did not join them because, according to the subsequent police report, he was working in construction and said he had to get up early the following morning. The three friends went to the Rio Room dance club and stayed there until "after midnight." According to subsequent testimony of the male who accompanied the two girls, Samota "was going [from] table to table, talking to people" and seemed like "she knew everyone."
Afterward, Samota drove her two companions to their homes, first dropping off the male at around 1a.m. at his apartment on Matilda Street, in Lower Greenville, which was a five-minute walk from Samota's condo on Amesbury Drive, and then the female. The man later testified that, when he returned home, "he went to bed and fell asleep."
Samota next went by her boyfriend's apartment to say goodnight and returned to her place. The boyfriend subsequently stated that at approximately 1:45a.m. he got a call from Samota, who told him there was a man in her condo who asked her to use the phone and the bathroom. She did not know if the man was already there when she got home or if she allowed him to come in. "Talk to me," Samota reportedly said to her boyfriend, then said she would call "right back" and hung up. When she did not call back, the boyfriend phoned her, and no one answered. He drove to her condo, but there was no response when he knocked on the door, which was locked. He had with him an early-generation mobile phone, provided for his construction job, so he called information, who connected him to the police.
Police officers arrived at 2:17a.m. and broke through the door. They discovered Samota's dead, bloody, and naked body on the bed. The autopsy showed that the victim had been raped and then "repeatedly" stabbed, dying from wounds to her heart.
Investigation and arrest
For a long period of time, the police reportedly suspected an architect who was 23 years old at the time and living in a Lower Greenville apartment. He was the man who, the night of the murder, had gone out with Samota and another girl. The victim's boyfriend was reportedly also a suspect.
The case remained unsolved until 2008.
In 2006, then-Dallas police detective Linda Crum, tasked with the case, used the DNA evidence from blood, semen, and fingernail samples to try and find a match among persons with a criminal record. In 2008, the results pointed to a Donald Bess who, at the time of Samota's murder, was on parole while serving a 25-year sentence.
Claims by friend
Sheila Wysocki, who went to SMU and was a roommate of Samota, subsequently stated that the cold case was re-opened only because she kept "badgering" the police until "they were so sick and tired of" her that they assigned detective Crum to re-examine it. Wysocki credits the fact that she became a licensed private investigator in her desire to assist in solving Samota's murder. The police initially had stated the rape kit collected at the crime scene, which contained the incriminating DNA evidence, had been lost "in the [Dallas] floods."
Legal process
The defendant in the 2010 trial for the sexual assault and murder of Angela Samota was already in prison, serving a life sentence. Donald Andrew Bess Jr. (born September 1, 1948, in Jefferson County, Arkansas), had been previously convicted in 1978 for aggravated sexual assault and aggravated kidnapping. He had been sentenced to 25 years in prison, and was out on parole by 1984, when, according to the court's decision, he raped and murdered Samota.
In 1985, in a case unrelated to Samota's murder, Bess was sentenced in Harris County, Texas, to life imprisonment for one count of aggravated rape, one count of aggravated kidnapping and one count of sexual assault.
During the punishment phase of the Samota case trial, in 2010, various women came forward and testified that they had also been raped by Bess. The defendant's ex-wife testified that he'd abused her and their child during their marriage. They had wed in 1969 and divorced three years later.
On the basis of the DNA match, Bess was found guilty by the jury and, on June 8, 2010, received the death sentence. On March 6, 2013, the appeal filed by Bess was rejected and the judgment of the trial court was affirmed. On August 13, 2013, a certiorari petition was filed to the U.S. Supreme Court, and denied on January 13, 2014. In April 2016, the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals refused an appeal submitted by Bess, upholding the findings of the Dallas County trial court.
Aftermath
In 2016, the Dallas Police Department re-established a unit dedicated to researching cold cases. In a 2021 Investigation Discovery episode, titled "Betrayed: Co-ed Killer", the case and the subsequent identification of Samota's murderer were re-enacted.
Donald Bess remains on death row in Polunsky prison with no execution date set. Samota's body is buried in the Llano Cemetery, Amarillo, Texas. Sheila Wysocki lives in Tennessee and is still a practicing private investigator.

Malaysia Premier's Literary Award () is the main national prize in literature in Malaysia.
It is awarded every two years in three categories.
Category A (books, collections of one author). Genres: a novel, a collection of short stories, a collection of poems, a collection of plays, a collection of critical essays, a collection of literary research, a biographical (autobiographical) work.
Category B (individual works published in magazines, newspapers, collections). Genres: a poem, a story, a play, a critical essay.
Category C (literature for children and young people). Genres: a story, a collection of short stories, a collection of poems, a collection of plays.
History of the Award
Established in 1971 on the proposal of the Prime Minister Abdul Razak. Originally was called the "Prize for a literary work" () and was awarded every year until 1976 for the best poem, story, anthology of poems, a two-act play, a story and a critical essay. For five years, 30 writers, including poets Ahmad Sarji, Zakaria Ali, Latiff Mohidin, Zurinah Hassan, Jaafa Kh. S., Zaihasra, T. Alias Taib, Lim Swee Tin, writers Anwar Ridhwan, Hatijah Hashim, Fatimah Busu, playwright Azizi HaJi Abdullah.
Since 1977 to 1980, the prize was not awarded.
Since 1981, the prize has been revived under the new name "Literary Prize of Malaysia" (Hadiah Sastera Malaysia) every two years. Since the 1990/1991season, the prize has been awarded only for works published as a book. This was motivated by the need to improve the quality criteria for the selection of works. This led to the fact that the number of entries accepted for the competition fell sharply.
Since the season of 1996/1997 the prize has received the modern name.
In 2015/2016, 44 literary works were awarded this prize

Lutetian limestone (in French, calcaire lutécien, and formerly calcaire grossier) — also known as “Paris stone” — is a variety of limestone particular to the Paris, France, area. It has been a source of wealth as an economic and versatile building material since ancient Roman times (see Mines of Paris) and has contributed markedly to the unique visual appeal of the “City of Light”. (It has been hailed as “the warm, elusive, cream-grey stone of the French capital”.) Its formation dates to the Eocene epoch's Lutetian age (between ). The name "Lutetian" derives from Lutetia (French, Lutèce) which was the city's name in ancient times.
History
Between the 17th and 19th centuries, Lutetian limestone was extracted by tunneling through hill-sides south of Paris. The stone comprises many of the grandest Paris buildings from the 17th century onwards, including parts of the Louvre, the Place de la Concorde and Les Invalides.
Haussmann's grand renovation of Paris (1853-1870), which provided a sweeping and uniform style and an elusive coloring — ranging from bright white to butter-yellow to a dull nicotine-yellow/grey — for the city, relied upon buildings faced with Lutetian limestone.
In the 20th century, open-cast quarries were developed which uncovered thinner layers of harder limestone closer to the surface north of Paris. A now fashionable variety of Lutetian limestone from about 25 miles north of Paris is known as “Oise stone” or "Saint-Maximin limestone" and has become popular internationally for upscale building projects. In 2007, the quarries in southern Oise, around Saint-Maximin and Chantilly, applied to the French government to become the first to be granted a building stone Appellation Contrôlée – the badge of official French regional excellence – as if it were a wine or a cheese. According to a 2007 article in the UK's The Independent: “The harder, sliceable limestone sells for around €2,000 a cubic metre. The different grades of softer building stone sell for between €550 and €150 a cubic metre, which is very competitive with other building stone all around the world.”

Background
Following the triumphant 2010 and 2011 UK theatre tours, the smash hit Queen and Ben Elton musical, We Will Rock You announce the show will embark on its first ever world arena tour. With 24 of Queen's biggest hits delivered in a show that boasts the scale and spectacle that marked the bands' legendary live performances, this will be one of the most spectacular musicals to tour the world.

is a Japanese video game developer, publisher, arcade manufacturer and distribution company based in Tokyo. A subsidiary of Sega, the company is known for video game series such as Megami Tensei, Persona, Etrian Odyssey and Trauma Center, as well as Print Club (Purikura) arcade machines. Its corporate mascot is Jack Frost, a snowman-like character from their Shin Megami Tensei series. Outside of video games, the company is known for their Purikura arcade machines, which are selfie photo sticker booths popular in East Asia.
Atlus was established in April 1986 and spent its early years as a video game developer for other companies. It became a video game publisher of its own in 1989 and existed until it was merged into Index Corporation in October 2010. After the dissolution, the name Atlus continued as a brand used by Index Corporation for video game publishing until 2013, when it was bought by Sega and revived as a company initially under the name Sega Dream Corporation.
Atlus has three development divisions: Creative Department 1st Production (Team Maniax), Creative Department 2nd Production (P-Studio), and Creative Department 3rd Production (Studio Zero). A North American branch of the company, Atlus West, was founded in 1991 in order to focus on publishing and localizing games for North America, while a European branch, which is handled via the London-based Sega of Europe Division, was founded in 2017.
History
Atlus began on 7 April 1986 as a video game developer of computer games for other companies. In January 1987, Atlus started selling amusement equipment. It expanded into the sale of karaoke equipment in March 1989. Atlus released the first video game under its own name in 1989: Puzzle Boy for the Game Boy.
Atlus started in the arcade industry in the 1990s by manufacturing its first arcade video game, BlaZeon, in 1992. In 1995, Atlus launched Print Club (Purikura) at arcades in partnership with Sega. It is a photo sticker booth that produces selfie photos. It was conceived by Atlus employee Sasaki Miho in 1994; her bosses at Atlus were initially reluctant about the idea, before later deciding to go ahead with it. Atlus and Sega introduced Purikura in February 1995, initially at game arcades, before expanding to other popular culture locations such as fast food shops, train stations, karaoke establishments and bowling alleys. Purikura became a popular form of entertainment among youths across East Asia, laying the foundations for modern selfie culture. It also introduced a large female demographic to the company's previously male-dominated arcade customer base. By 1996, it accounted for 70% of the company's revenue. By 1997, about 47,000 Purikura machines had been sold, earning Sega an estimated () or annually from Purikura sales that year. Various other similar purikira machines appeared from other manufacturers, with Sega controlling about half of the market in 1997. Print Club went on to generate over in sales for Atlus and Sega.
Atlus entered the Tokyo Stock Exchange in 1997, listing on the JASDAQ. In its goal to further increase its presence in the amusement industry, Atlus acquired the manufacturer Apies from Yubis Corporation in 1999. In 2000, Atlus formed a joint venture with Kadokawa Shoten to distribute and sell games. Atlus suffered from deficit financial results in both 1999 and 2000. To address the issue, Atlus established a management reform plan in 2001. In its restructuring efforts, Atlus sold two subsidiaries (one of them being Apies) to their respective employees as part of a management buyout.
In October 2001, Atlus acquired Career Soft, and became the sole publisher of the Growlanser series: a real-time strategy role-playing game from the creators of the Langrisser series. In 2004, after the release of Growlanser IV, the majority of Career Soft's staff was merged into the main development team of Atlus where they worked on the Shin Megami Tensei: Devil Survivor games. As a developer brand, Career Soft was eventually dissolved.
In October 2003, Japanese toy company Takara acquired Atlus. On 21 November 2006, Index Holdings announced the acquisition of Atlus, effective on 30 October 2006, and purchased 7.7 million shares (54.93 percent; 77,000 votes, or 54.96 percent of the voting rights) on 20 November 2006. Atlus became an Index Holdings subsidiary on 29 November 2006.
In March 2009, Atlus and Sting Entertainment announced a publishing partnership making Atlus the only publisher of Sting-developed games in Japan. On 17 September 2009, Index Holdings announced the separation of Atlus' amusement facility and related business into a subsidiary, New Entertainment Waves, effective on 1 December. One hundred seventy-two shares of the subsidiary's stock were also transferred to Chushoukigyou Leisure on 1 December.
On 30 August 2010, Index Holdings announced its merger with Atlus, with Index Holdings being the surviving company, effective on 1 October. After the merger, Index Holdings would continue to operate the Atlus brand. Although fans were concerned about the company's future, CEO Shinichi Suzuki said that Atlus would continue to provide the "finest quality game experiences possible" and the merger "further strengthens the foundation of Atlus, both in Japan and here in the United States." On 9 November 2010 Index Holdings announced its renaming to Index Corporation, to be confirmed at the shareholders meeting on 25 November 2010 and effective on 1 December.
From 2010 to 2013, Atlus, as a company, ceased to exist and its name became a brand of Index Corporation for video games in Japan. However, Atlus USA remained active and was renamed Index Digital Media, serving as the North American subsidiary for Index Corporation. Much like in Japan, video games continued to be released in that region under the Atlus name during this period. In June 2013, it was reported that Index Corporation filed for civil rehabilitation proceedings, facing bankruptcy with debts of ¥24.5 billion. An Atlus USA spokesperson said that Index Digital Media and the Atlus brand were unaffected by the proceedings.
On 18 September 2013, it was reported that Sega won a bid to acquire the bankrupt Index for ¥14 billion. All Index operations, including the Atlus brand and Index Digital Media (Atlus USA), were transferred on 1 November 2013 to Sega Dream Corporation (a new subsidiary established on 5 September 2013). That day, Sega announced that it would change the name of Sega Dream Corporation to Index Corporation.
On 18 February 2014, Sega announced the separation of Index Corporation's contents and solution businesses into a new subsidiary, Index Corporation, renaming the old Index Corporation and its remaining digital game business division to Atlus effective 1 April 2014. The new Atlus would include the foreign subsidiary, Index Digital Media, which would revert its name back to Atlus USA at the establishment of the new Atlus.
In April 2017, Sega Sammy Holdings announced a relocation of head office functions of the Sega Sammy Group and its major domestic subsidiaries located in the Tokyo metropolitan area to Shinagawa-ku by January 2018. Their stated reasoning was to promote cooperation among companies and creation of more active interaction of personnel, while pursuing efficient group management by consolidating scattered head office functions of the group. Atlus is one of the companies that has relocated in response to this. The company has three divisions: Creative Department 1st Production (responsible for managing the Shin Megami Tensei and Etrian Odyssey series), Creative Department 2nd Production (also called P-Studio and responsible for managing the Persona series), and Creative Department 3rd Production (also called Studio Zero).
Controversies
In 2021 and 2022, Atlus has sued several fans involved in the game preservation project related to its long defunct MMO Shin Megami Tensei: Imagine. The official servers for that game shut down in May 2016, and a revived fan server was launched in late 2020. Atlus claimed that the fan server "caused and will continue to cause irreparable damage to Atlus" despite the game no longer being supported by the company. The suit has created a chilling effect in the game preservation community.
International branches
Atlus West
Atlus West (formerly known as Atlus U.S.A., Inc.) established in 1991 and based in Irvine, California, is the American subsidiary of Atlus and publishes games created by Atlus and other developers. It was formally called Index Digital Media from 2010 to 2014 in response to Atlus being dissolved into Index Corporation.
A number of Megami Tensei games have not been released in North America. During the 1990s, Jack Bros. for Virtual Boy, Revelations: Persona for PlayStation and Revelations: The Demon Slayer for the Game Boy Color were the first three games in the series to have a North American release. The 2004 release of Shin Megami Tensei: Nocturne was the first main-series video-game release in the U.S. Since then, the series has continued to be localized and released in the US, including games such as Persona 3, Devil Summoner: Raidou Kuzunoha vs. The Soulless Army, and Shin Megami Tensei: Strange Journey.
Atlus West has localized cult classic Disgaea: Hour of Darkness, created by Nippon Ichi Software. The company have also published the tactical role-playing game Tactics Ogre and Game Boy Advance remakes of the Kunio-kun and Double Dragon games for A Million (a company composed of former Technōs Japan employees). Other notable titles include Snowboard Kids and Snowboard Kids 2 (for Nintendo 64) and Odin Sphere and the Trauma Center series. Atlus USA released Riviera: The Promised Land, a role-playing video game for the Game Boy Advance previously released for the Wonderswan Color, in 2004 in collaboration with Sting and Bandai. In 2006 Atlus USA and Sting released Yggdra Union, a strategy role-playing game (RPG) for the Game Boy Advance. After Working Designs' publication of Growlanser Generations, they released Growlanser: Heritage of War in 2005 and Growlanser Wayfarer of Time in 2012.
The company established an online division, including the Atlus Online portal which is servicing Neo Steam: The Shattered Continent and Shin Megami Tensei: Imagine. On 31 March 2013, Index Digital Media's Atlus Online Division was purchased by Marvelous AQL and transferred to Xseed Games. Atlus USA has published games under the Marl Kingdom name, beginning with Rhapsody: A Musical Adventure in 2000. On 18 February 2014 Sega announced that Index Digital Media would revert its name back to Atlus USA. In March 2016, Sega announced that all the future localized products from Atlus for North America will be published by Sega. Between 2019 and 2020, Atlus USA changed its public brand name to Atlus West.
Europe and Oceania
Until 2017, Atlus did not have a dedicated European division for publishing and distributing their titles within the European and Oceania region. Instead, many of Atlus' titles were published in these regions by Nippon Ichi Software (NIS) and its American division NIS America. Following Atlus's acquisition by Sega Sammy Holdings, NIS found that it became more difficult to work between Sega and Atlus for distribution and in April 2016, formally ended its distribution partnership with Atlus. In July 2016, Deep Silver announced that it had come to agreement to become Atlus' distributor for Europe and Oceania, and would begin to publish titles in both retail and digital form. In August 2017, Atlus announced that they had opened a European distribution team located in Sega Europe's offices in London that would publish all its games going forward.
Corporate mascot
Jack Frost, who appears as a demon character in the Shin Megami Tensei franchise, is the company mascot. Resembling a snowman, he has teeth, a tail and no nose, and wears a jester hat, collar, and shoes. His catchphrase is "Hee-Ho". He has appeared in several games in the Shin Megami Tensei series, as well as the Jack Bros. and Persona games. Jack Frost is a hidden character in the North American and Japanese versions of SBK: Snowboard Kids, with a larger role in the Japanese version. He has a family; more relatives were created since Shin Megami Tensei II, including King Frost, Pyro Jack (Known as "Jack-O-Lantern" in some localizations), Frost 5 Senshi and Black Frost.

(David) Gwyther (Broome) Irwin (7 May 1931 – 18 October 2008) was a British abstract artist born in Basingstoke, Hampshire, who had lived much of his life in north Cornwall. He was educated in Dorset, at Goldsmiths College and at the Central School of Art in London 1951–1954. Irwin first came to prominence in 1957 with an exhibition at Gallery One, and another at Gimpel Fils in 1959. In 1964, he represented Britain at the Venice Biennale, along with Joe Tilson, Bernard Meadows and Roger Hilton. In 1960, he married Elizabeth Gowlett and they had two sons and one daughter.
His most famous artworks consisted of pictures assembled from newsprint and fragments of advertisements on paper, which he collected from the streets with his wife, and which were then worked up into collages often of fine delicacy and quite subtle shades. Some of his later works also used string, wood shavings, chalk and paint.
"Gwyther Irwin's latest collages...are evidently miracles of patient assembly...they set out to achieve the subtlest and slowest possible shifts in tonality from umber darkness to creamy light and back again. The patience, the subtlety, the muted gradations of every effect combine to produce an atmosphere of studied beauty." (The Times, 18 September 1959)
In the 1960s he taught at art schools in Hornsey, Corsham and Chelsea before becoming head of fine art at Brighton polytechnic between 1969 and 1984.

William McQuhae or M'Quhae (1737–1823) was a senior Scottish clergyman in the Church of Scotland who by the time of his death was Father of the Church. He is one of the few persons to have declined the offer to be Moderator of the General Assembly. He was a member of the New Light Movement. He is mentioned within the poems of Robert Burns.
Life
He was born in Wigtown on 1 May 1737 the son of David McQuhae, a local magistrate and his wife Margaret Laurie.
In his youth in Edinburgh he was tutored to David Boswell and John Boswell, the younger brothers of James Boswell who was a close friend to McQuhae.
He studied at the University of Glasgow and was licensed by the Presbytery of Wigtown to preach as a Church of Scotland minister on 24 March 1762. He served as assistant in St Quivox to George Reid. On Reid's death in 1763 McQuhae was presented as the new minister of St Quivox by James Murray of Broughton. He was formally ordained in the position on 1 March 1764.
In June 1794 St Andrews University awarded him a Doctor of Divinity. In 1806 he declined the position of Moderator of the General Assembly and the post was instead given to Rev William Taylor of St Enoch's Church in Glasgow.
He died as Father of the Church on 1 March 1823, on the 59th anniversary of his ordination.
Family
He married twice: firstly in November 1765 to Elizabeth Park daughter of William Park of Barkip. They had several children, most of whom died young: Richard McQuhae (1766–1805) died in Jamaica; Sarah (1769–1778); Margaret (1770–1836); David (1773–1775); Elizabeth (1774–1778); Glencairn (daughter) (1776–1802); Charles (daughter) (1778–1855) married Alexander McDowal.
Following his wife's death he married Mary Lawrie (died 1824) in June 1782. They had several more children: Mary (born 1783) married John Stirling, minister of Craigie, Elizabeth (born 1784); Lydia Wills McQuhae (born 1785) married Thomas Ainsworth of Blackburn; William McQuhae (1787–1824) a Major in the British Army died in Calcutta; Patrick (born 1788); James (1790–1819); Stair Park McQuhae (1795–1872) succeeded his father as minister of St Quivox; Laura Macrae McQuhae (1798–1802).
The family continued to live in the manse after William's death (with his son as minister) and it was extended to 1825 to accommodate the large family.

Tureng Tepe (, "Hill of the Pheasants"; alternatively spelled in English as Turang Tappe/Tape/Tappa/Tappeh) is a Neolithic and Chalcolithic archaeological site in northeastern Iran, in the Gorgan plain, approximately 17 km northeast of the town of Gorgan. Nearby is a village of Turang Tappeh.
Description
Tureng Tepe consists of a group of mounds interspersed with ponds and water courses. The whole archaeological pattern is about 800 – 900 m in diameter. Most of the mounds rise between 11 and 15 m above the level of the surrounding plan, but the steep central mound, marked A on the Wulsin's plan, is over 30 m high and dominated the entire site.
The oldest remains on the site date to the Neolithic and Chalcolithic periods. The Bronze Age settlement portion of the site dates from approximately 3100-2900 BC through 1900 BC. In 1841, some material (including gold vessels) from the site was sent to the Shah (Mohammad Shah Qajar), and examined by Clement Augustus (C.A.) de Bode, piquing initial modern interest in the site. The first modern excavations were done by Frederick Wulsin in 1931, sponsored by the Atkins Museum of Fine Arts. Grey ware pottery from the site was found and studied. In the mid-20th century, the site (a hill) had a height of approximately 30m. In 1959, Jean Deshayes (1924–1979) rediscovered the site, and regular excavations began soon after until 1979.
Figurines
The figurines of Tureng Tepe have long been recognized as quite remarkable. They include both terracotta and stone figurines.
As far as the stone figurines, there are many similarities between Tureng and the nearby sites of Shah Tepe, Tepe Hissār, and Gohar Tappeh. Yet the terracotta figurines of Tureng Tepe are unparalleled at any other nearby site. These baked clay figurines find their parallels with sites further away, in Turkmenistan and the Indus valley. Some parallels as far as Mesopotamia have been suggested.
Based on the patterns that emerge from various excavated artefacts, it is clear that Tureng Tepe is a site of special importance in its immediate region.
Chronology
Neolithic and Chalcolithic
Tureng IA (Neolithic period - these layers are assumed to lie below the water table. From this horizon occur Djeitun-like sherds, incorporated in bricks made in later periods)
Tureng IB (Late Neolithic period - again presumably below the water table)
Tureng IIA (Early Chalcolithic period)
Bronze Age
Tureng IIB (ca. 3100–2600 BC)
Tureng III A / B (ca. 2600–2100 BC). To this period belongs an enormous, mud-bricks high terrace, constructed in the center of the settlement and representing perhaps the earliest example of monumental architecture in this region.
Tureng III C (about 2100 -? BC)
Iron Age
Tureng IV A (Iron Age, possibly 7th century BC)
Tureng IV B Iron Age, possibly 6th century BC)
Tureng VA (2nd century BC)
Historical time
Tureng VB (1st century BC)
Tureng VC / D (1st–2nd century AD)
Tureng VI A Sasanian empire(3rd–5th century AD)
Tureng VI B end of the Sasanian empire (possibly 6th - 7th centuries)
Tureng VII A / B Islamic occupation at the top of Mound A(10th–11th century AD)
Tureng VIII some Islamic remains located in the south-west part of the site (possibly 13th century AD)
During the Bronze Age, Tureng Tepe was likely a thriving settlement.

Sujeonggwa is a Korean traditional cinnamon punch. Dark reddish brown in color, it is made from mainly cinnamon, sugar, water and ginger. It's often served with gotgam (dried persimmon) and garnished with pine nuts. The punch is made by brewing first the cinnamon sticks and ginger at a slow boil. The solids are then removed for clarification and the remaining liquid is boiled again after adding either honey or brown sugar. The dried persimmons are cut into portions and are added to soak and soften after the brew has completely cooled. This is usually done several hours before serving, as extensive soaking of the fruit may thicken the clear liquid to a murky appearance.
Sujeonggwa is served cold and commonly as a dessert, much like sikhye, due to its sweet taste. It is also widely available in canned form.
History
The earliest mention of sujeonggwa dates back to 1849 in the book Dongguksesigi (동국세시기, 東國歲時記), a book of seasonal customs written by scholar Hong Seok-mo (홍석모). The sujeonggwa recipe mentioned in the book is a dried persimmon brew with added ginger and pine nuts.
In the book Haedongjukji (해동죽지, 海東竹枝) written in 1921, sujeonggwa is known to have been prepared in the Goryeo era by palace women on New Year's Day. Then they were boiling ginger and adding persimmons to the brew. Its former name was baekjeho (백제호), literally meaning "white milky beverage", and was named after the white appearance of sugar-coated persimmons. Nowadays sujeonggwa is a popular traditional beverage drank year-round.
The recipe of sujeonggwa has changed over time. The recipe of sujeonggwa is first mentioned in Sujaguigwe (수작의궤,受爵儀軌). Ginger was not used in Gunhakoedeung (군학회등, 群學會騰), and cinnamon was first used in The Recipes of Joseon (조선요리법, 朝鮮料理法). Pear was used in The New Making of Joseon Food (조선무쌍신식요리제법, 朝鮮無雙新式料理製法) and liquorice, mandarin peels, whole black pepper was also sometimes added. Honey was originally used for sweetening but it was replaced with sugar after The Recipes of Joseon.
Variants
Geonsisujeonggwa (cinnamon punch with dried persimmon)
Geonsisujeonggwa is an original kind of sujeonggwa. It uses ginger and cinnamon as its main ingredients, and usually adds honey or sugar to taste sweet. Garnish with pine nut or gotgam (dried persimmon) on last.
Galyeonsujeonggwa (lotus cinnamon punch)
Galyeonsujeonggwa uses schisandra as its main ingredients, and adds honey or sugar to keep it sweet and the inside flower petal of lotus in the water. The leaves must be boiled and coated by starch powder.
Jabgwasujeonggwa (cinnamon punch with miscellaneous fruits)
Jabgwasujeonggwa adds chopped citron or pear in the sweet water. It is very similar to Hwachae.
Cinnamon punch with pear
This variant uses pear instead of dried persimmon. In the past, people ate boiled pears (another name of Cinnamon Punch with Pear, in Korean, is Insug) because most high quality pears are so stiff to eat. In order to make it easier to eat pears, they made them into a kind of cinnamon punch.
Cinnamon punch with pumpkin
This variant adds pumpkin to the original. It is usually enjoyed in Gangwon-do.
Recipe
Ingredients
Ginger, whole cinnamon, brown sugar, white sugar, dried persimmon (gotgam), walnut, pine nut
Process
Put some gingers and pour water in a big pot. Heat it up about 10 minutes on high heat. When it boils, lower to medium heat and boil for an hour. Filter the liquid with cotton cloths.
Put some whole cinnamons and pour some water in a pot. Heat it up about 10 minutes on high heat. When it boils, lower to medium heat and boil for an hour. Filter it with cotton cloths.
Pour ginger water and cinnamon water in a pot and add brown sugar and white sugar. Boil it on high heat for 11 minutes. As it boils, lower the heat level to medium and boil for 10 minutes. Cool the liquid after boiling.
Garnish with dried persimmon ssam and pine nuts before serving.
Tip
It is recommended to boil ginger and whole cinnamon separately in order to maximize the fragrance and flavor.
Whole dried persimmon (Gotgam) could be used instead of dried persimmon ssam.

Shida (born 1990) is an Australian multidisciplinary artist best known for his large scale mural work. Shida's practice encompasses video, publishing, public works and murals.
"Shida explores the relationship between Ritual, Sexuality and Love. Psychedelic entities are entwined in a ceremonial act transcending the bounds of known reality. In a world where society's issues are becoming increasingly gendered and people are seemingly more divided than ever due to the rise of identity politics. Shida seeks to turn this tide like an ancient shaman with each works being in essence an invocation, an energetic manifestation, a prayer to joy." 7
Shida has been involved in street art since 2004 with early work of his featured in RASH a documentary covering Melbourne's burgeoning street art scene. "Shida has created his work across more than 35 cities, in over 20 countries. The great majority of his work is created pro bono for the neighbourhoods and communities that he visits on his travels and across Australia. His work reflects his multicultural upbringing. It is naturally Australian while at the same time being influenced by a plethora of different cultures arts as well as his own polish cultural heritage"

Dun Hallin is an Iron Age broch located near the northwest coast of the island of Skye, in Scotland ().
Location
Dun Hallin is located on the Waternish peninsula of Skye, just east of the settlement of Hallin. It occupies the southeast end of a steep-sided rocky plateau overlooking a fertile valley and the sea.
Description
Dun Hallin has an external diameter of around 17.4 metres and an internal diameter of around 10.5 metres. The broch walls currently stand to a maximum height of 3.8 metres on the north and west sides. The entrance is on the southeast side but is in a ruined state. On each side of the entrance passage are oval guard cells, although only the northern, right-hand cell can easily be seen. The interior of the broch has much rubble grassed over. A mural gallery is visible on the southwest side and a lintel stone remains in position over the doorway there. Six steps of the intra-mural stairway were found when the broch was examined in 1921 but are not now apparent.
The broch is additionally defended by an outer stone wall which runs round the edge of the rocky knoll and which is still about 6 metres high to the south.
The broch has not been excavated.

Silent Storm is a 2003 Australian documentary film written and directed by Peter Butt.
Synopsis
From 1957 to 1978, scientists secretly removed bone samples from over 21,000 dead Australians as they searched for evidence of the deadly poison, Strontium 90 – a by-product of nuclear testing. Silent Storm reveals the story behind this astonishing case of officially sanctioned 'body-snatching'. Set against a backdrop of the Cold War, the saga follows celebrated scientist, Hedley Marston, as he attempts to blow the whistle on radioactive contamination and challenge official claims that British atomic tests posed no threat to the Australian people. Marston's findings are not only disputed, he is targeted as 'a scientist of counter-espionage interest'.

Walter Bingham (born Wolfgang Billig in Karlsruhe, Weimar Republic in 1924) is a British-Israeli journalist, actor, entrepreneur, Holocaust survivor and decorated World War II veteran. He made Aliyah to Israel in 2004. At age 98 in 2022, Walter is Israel's oldest working journalist. He also holds the Guinness World Record as the oldest Radio Talkshow Host.
Walter Bingham was born in Karlsruhe, Germany, to an observant Jewish family. His parents had moved from Poland to Germany as children. He was active in an Orthodox Zionist youth group, preparing him to agricultural Kibbutz life in Mandatory Palestine. Bingham witnessed the Nazi book burnings that followed soon after the Nazi Seizure of Power and personally experienced antisemitic bullying. As Bingham and his parents held Polish citizenship and were not German nationals, they were affected by Polenaktion - the arrest and expulsion of Polish Jews living in Germany. Bingham's father was arrested but he himself was not caught up in the sweep as he had been away from the family home at the time - his parents had sent him to a Jewish school in Mannheim. Shortly afterwards, Bingham witnessed the events of Kristallnacht. He survived the Holocaust because of a Kindertransport to Great Britain in 1939, where he lived for the most part in a Zionist Kibbutz type community.
During World War II, the Free Polish Forces attempted to recruit him as he was a Polish national, but Bingham instead enlisted in the British Army and served as an ambulance driver in the Royal Army Service Corps. He took part on the front line in the Normandy landings of 1944. During one mission, his ambulance was knocked out by German fire, wounding his orderly and killing an officer. He then braved withering fire to rescue wounded soldiers. For his actions, he was awarded the Military Medal for 'Bravery in the Field' by King George VI. He would later be awarded France's highest honour, the Légion d'honneur, for his participation in the Normandy landings. Due to being a native German speaker, Bingham was transferred to Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force to work as a documents specialist, analyzing captured German documents. While stationed in occupied Germany, he also worked in counter-intelligence and helped identify Nazi officers attempting to conceal their former roles. He interrogated former Nazi foreign minister Joachim von Ribbentrop, who denied all knowledge of the Holocaust.
His mother survived the Holocaust; she was one of the Jewish prisoners whose release was secured by Folke Bernadotte. She took refuge in Sweden and permanently settled there. After the war, while still serving in the British Army, Bingham was granted compassionate leave to visit his mother in Sweden.
Bingham was discharged from the British Army in 1947. He studied political philosophy at Birkbeck, University of London. He was invited to join the fight for Jewish independence in Mandatory Palestine, but decided against it. He later explained his decision to the Jerusalem Post: "I'd had enough war. Had I gone, and had I still been alive, who knows what I could have been. But I didn't go. Today, being alive, and seeing where I live, I have some regrets." He met his wife, a refugee from Vienna, in the early 1950s. Although his friends from the Zionist community where he had lived moved to Israel and were among the founders of kibbutz Lavi, Bingham stayed in Britain as his wife did not want to leave. He worked in various jobs and at one point opened a diaper factory which went out of business in 1965. He has a daughter who later moved to Israel, as well as two grandchildren and two great-grandchildren. His wife died in 1990.
Bingham went on to have a career as a journalist and broadcaster in Britain. He also modeled and acted in numerous movies and TV shows. Among his acting credits is a wizard in Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone and Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, as well as numerous roles in various TV documentaries calling for older men with a white beard. He was also an advertising model and Santa Claus in London's premier department stores Harrods and Selfridges.
He immigrated to Israel in 2004. At age 80, he attempted to get a job at Kol Israel but was turned down due to his age. He subsequently found work as a journalist with Israel National News.
Since 2004, he has hosted "Walter's World" a weekly radio magazine programme on Israel National News and since 2016 The Walter Bingham File on Israel News Talk Radio. He is also a regular contributor to The Jerusalem Post and The Jerusalem Report.
In 2018 Bingham became Israels the oldest skydiver when he participated in a parachute jump in northern Israel.

Semyon Dukach (born 25 October 1968) is a Russian-American entrepreneur and former professional blackjack player. He is the founding partner of One Way Ventures, a venture capital fund that backs immigrant entrepreneurs.
He was the managing director of Techstars in Boston. He was also the chairman of SMTP (company), and a former professional blackjack player with the MIT Blackjack Team. He played with Strategic Investments and later was one of the founding members and team leaders on Amphibian Investments whose exploits were chronicled in Ben Mezrich's Busting Vegas and referred to in Mezrich's Bringing Down the House. Dukach was the main character in Busting Vegas and the only member of the MIT blackjack team to be referred to by his real name in either book.
Early life
Born on 25 October 1968 in Moscow, Dukach moved to the US in 1979 at the age of 11. He completed a BS in Computer Science at Columbia University in 1990 and a MS in Computer Science at MIT in 1993.
At a young age Semyon developed an interest in video games and specifically Pac-Man. Semyon became proficient at the game by reading Ken Uston's Mastering PAC-MAN. This led him to read Uston's other titles on blackjack, giving him an understanding of the basics of card counting before he was approached to play with the MIT Blackjack Team.
Blackjack career
While attending MIT, Dukach was trained as a player on the MIT Blackjack team whose exploits were loosely depicted in the Hollywood movie 21.
Starting out with Strategic Investments (SI) in 1992, Dukach was a major player on the team. At the end of 1993 SI dissolved and Semyon was involved in a team effort with the remaining players from SI for the next year. By 1995 Dukach and a few players split off from that team and formed a second, independent team. This new team was referred to as the Amphibians and the team that they left was referred to as the Reptiles.
Since stopping play in the late 1990s, Dukach's involvement in blackjack has been limited.
Angel investing and Techstars
Dukach is an angel investor. In 2014, Dukach assumed the role of managing director of Techstars in Boston. He ran the program for three years before leaving in 2017 to found One Way Ventures, a venture capital fund for exceptional immigrant founders.
Venture capital
Dukach co-founded One Way Ventures in 2017 and currently serves as a managing partner. One Way Ventures is an early-stage venture capital fund that focuses on investing in startups with at least one immigrant founder on the team. The fund is based in Boston, Massachusetts. The firm focuses on tech-enabled startups in the Pre-seed to Series A stages, and has made investments in startups including Brex, LovePop, and Chipper Cash.

Fair Extension is a novella by American writer Stephen King, published in his collection Full Dark, No Stars (2010).
Synopsis
In August 2001, on his way home in Derry, Maine, Dave Streeter sees a man with a setup by a road to the airport. He goes out and talks with the man, George Elvid, who claims to have lived for centuries and tells Streeter that he sells extensions of various types. Elvid offers Streeter, who suffers from terminal lung cancer, a chance to live for approximately fifteen years if he pays fifteen percent of his salary for every one of those years and transfers the "weight" of his misfortune onto someone he knows. Elvid emphasizes that it has to be someone that Streeter truly hates.
Streeter selects Tom Goodhugh, his best friend since childhood whom he has secretly hated for years. Streeter has done everything for Goodhugh, who has taken him for granted the entire time. Goodhugh got straight-As with Streeter doing his homework throughout their formative years. Later, Goodhugh stole Streeter's girlfriend in college and married her. Goodhugh has founded a successful waste removal business with Streeter's assistance, lives a lavish lifestyle with three children on the fast track to great lives, and doesn't look like age has caught up with him, unlike Streeter.
A couple of days later, Streeter goes to his doctor, who tells him his tumors are shrinking. Four months later, Streeter is declared cancer-free, which perplexes his doctor. The good luck continues in subsequent years, as Streeter is promoted several times at work and his marriage becomes joyous and rich with significant lifestyle improvements. His children begin a long line of career successes: his son becomes a millionaire after creating two bestselling video games and his daughter gets her dream job as a journalist at the Boston Globe after graduating from the Columbia School of Journalism.
Goodhugh's misfortunes start to surface a few months after Streeter's deal, when his wife is diagnosed with breast cancer that has spread to her lymph nodes; she dies six months later. His business begins to fail after his accountant embezzles $2 million and skips town. Goodhugh's children also suffer: his middle child, Carl, has a heart attack and is left with permanent brain damage; his oldest child, Gracie, loses her husband to a drunk driver, loses all her teeth after developing pyorrhea, and eventually gives birth to a stillborn baby; and his youngest son, Jake, turns down an athletic scholarship to help save the garbage business.
While Streeter continues to enjoy his good fortune, Goodhugh's life becomes grim and joyless. Gracie is forced to move back home and becomes deeply depressed; Carl's full-time caretaker is let go, leading to Carl's death by choking on an apple; and Jake is sent to prison for stabbing his wife. Goodhugh's waste disposal company is seized by the EPA. Goodhugh himself develops gout and psoriasis, begins drinking heavily, and experiences major weight loss. He contemplates suicide, likens himself to Job, and believes he has "offended God". Although Streeter pretends to be caring and supportive, he's secretly glad as he sees Goodhugh struggle to cope with his family's misfortune.
The story ends with Streeter and his wife stargazing. She confesses her sadness over the Goodhugh family's troubles, and he assures her that this is only fair, and that some people are simply dealt a bad hand by life. They catch a glimpse of the planet Venus, and Streeter tells his wife to make a wish. She cannot think of anything they need, and the story ends with Streeter making a single wish: for more.

Steart (pronounced Ste-art), historically also called Stert, is a small village in Somerset, England. It lies in an isolated position on the Steart Peninsula on the Bristol Channel coast, about north of Bridgwater.
The toponym is derived from the Old English steort, meaning "tail, projecting piece of land". Steart was historically in the ancient parish of Stockland Bristol, except for the foreshore on the Bristol Channel coast, which was in the parish of Stogursey. In 1885 it was transferred to the civil parish of Otterhampton.
A medieval chapel at Steart was disused by 1611. The church of St Andrew was built in 1882. The Bethel Congregational church was open between 1847 and 1938.
During World War 2, two small radio direction-finding stations were located in Steart. They were part of a secret MI6 organisation called The Radio Security Service listening to and locating the communications of German spies and their handlers. These stations intercepted the messages of the Abwehr, the German Secret Intelligence Service, and provided a large volume of high level intelligence throughout the war. In December 1945, in the nearby village of Combwich The Freedom of Steart was conferred upon Captain Louis Varney, the officer in command of the DF Stations.
The West Somerset Coast Path and River Parrett Trail both start at Steart.

The Anna Scherlie Homestead Shack is a site on the National Register of Historic Places located in Turner, Montana, United States. It was added to the Register on November 5, 1998.
A historic placard at the site reads:
The Enlarged Homestead Act of 1909 brought settlers to Montana and to this area called the Big Flat. Neil J. Scherlie was among the first to file a homestead claim and over the course of four years, three sisters and two brothers made claims nearby. Thirty-two-year-old Anna Scherlie arrived in 1913, becoming part of a long tradition of women homesteaders in Montana. In fact, in the four surrounding townships, women made up about one-fourth of the total homestead applicants. By 1916, Anna had forty acres planted in wheat, oats, and flax. Isolation on the Big Flat led many settlers to winter elsewhere and Anna followed suit. Legend has it that she went to St. Paul to work for the family of railroad magnate James J. Hill. Over the decades, Anna made few changes to her small wood frame shack, adding only a vestibule for use as a summer kitchen, a storage shed, and laundry. Droughts, depression, and two world wars passed. Anna remained here long after her neighbors had built modern homes, insisting that she was “too old for modern conveniences.” The Spartan lifestyle seems to have been Anna's preference. When she died in 1973, an estate of more than $100,000 was divided among eighteen nieces and nephews; her ashes were scattered beneath a lilac bush on the property. Leon and Nellie Cederburg purchased the homestead when its seasoned resident moved to Havre in 1968. Rather than return the site to crop land, the Cederbergs maintain the homestead exactly as Anna left it.
The homestead building is a woodframe building with a gable roof.

Luke Harper and Erick Rowan, later known as The Bludgeon Brothers, were an American professional wrestling tag team in WWE. They were also known as being members of the cult faction The Wyatt Family, led by Bray Wyatt.
After work at house shows from June 2012 to November 2012, Luke Harper and Erick Rowan made their televised debut as a tag team in January 2013, under the leadership of Bray Wyatt as a part of The Wyatt Family stable. Together, they won the NXT Tag Team Championship in May 2013. They moved to the main roster later that year, eventually starting a feud against each other following the split of The Wyatt Family in late 2014. The duo would reunite in May 2015 and subsequently reconcile with Wyatt, reforming The Wyatt Family. Harper and Rowan suffered injuries during the group's revival, causing the duo to go inactive in 2016, but would eventually return as a team once again in October 2017 under the new moniker The Bludgeon Brothers (their respective ring names were also shortened to simply Harper and Rowan). They would go on to capture the SmackDown Tag Team Championship in April 2018 at WrestleMania 34. After losing their titles that August, they spent time apart due to injuries, ultimately reuniting in September 2019, dropping their Bludgeon Brothers gimmick and re-using their original ring names. However, this would be their last time teaming together, as during the 2019 WWE draft, Rowan was drafted to Raw while Harper remained on SmackDown. Harper was then granted his release from the promotion in December due to creative differences, while Rowan was subsequently released in April 2020 due to budget cuts as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Following their respective releases from WWE, Harper signed with All Elite Wrestling (AEW) under the ring name Brodie Lee, while Rowan began working on the independent circuit under the ring name Erick Redbeard. On December 26, 2020, Harper unexpectedly died. During an AEW tribute show on December 30, Rowan appeared for the first time in the promotion and paid tribute to his former tag team partner by holding up a sign in the ring that read: "Goodbye for now, my brother. See you down the road."
History
The Wyatt Family (2012–2014)
Rowan signed a WWE contract in February 2011 and Harper in March 2012, with both wrestlers performing in NXT's predecessor Florida Championship Wrestling (FCW). After FCW was rebranded to NXT Wrestling, Harper and Rowan debuted on NXT under the leadership of Bray Wyatt to form a faction known as The Wyatt Family in November, with the duo being referred to as Wyatt's "sons". On the January 23, 2013, episode of NXT, Harper and Rowan entered the NXT Tag Team Championship tournament to crown the inaugural champions, defeating the team of Percy Watson and Yoshi Tatsu in the first round. Following a win over Bo Dallas and Michael McGillicutty in the semi-finals with Wyatt's interference, Harper and Rowan went on to the finals of the tournament, but were defeated by Adrian Neville and Oliver Grey.
The Wyatt Family later assaulted Grey (who had suffered a legitimate injury) while Wyatt prevented Bo Dallas from winning a NXT Championship number one contender match due to Dallas refusal to join The Wyatt Family. On the May 2 episode of NXT, Harper and Rowan won a triple threat elimination tag team match by lastly pinning Neville to earn a shot at the NXT Tag Team Championship. On the May 8 episode of NXT, Harper and Rowan defeated Neville and Dallas, the latter of whom filling in for the injured Grey, to win the NXT Tag Team Championship. After Harper and Rowan won the titles, The Wyatt Family went on to feud with Corey Graves and Kassius Ohno,. On the June 19 episode of NXT, The Wyatt Family defeated the team of Graves, Neville and Ohno. On the July 17 episode of NXT, Harper and Rowan lost the NXT Tag Team Championship to Neville and Graves.
From the May 27 episode of Raw, WWE aired vignettes promoting the upcoming main roster debut of The Wyatt Family. The vignettes showed the Wyatt Family's backwoods origins and Rowan wearing a sheep mask. On the July 8 episode of Raw, The Wyatt Family made their debut by assaulting Kane. Harper and Rowan made their main roster in-ring debut on the July 26 episode of SmackDown, where they defeated Tons of Funk (Brodus Clay and Tensai) in a tag team match. Over the next few months, Harper and Rowan competed as a tag team and went on a winning streak over many teams, until Cody Rhodes and Goldust handed them their first loss on the October 11 episode of SmackDown. In early 2014, Harper and Rowan feuded with The Shield, while also supporting Bray Wyatt in his feud with John Cena. While Wyatt and Cena's feud continued, Harper and Rowan also started a feud with The Usos, unsuccessfully challenging for the WWE Tag Team Championship at Money in the Bank and Battleground.
Split and feud (2014–2015)
On September 29, 2014, vignettes began to air of Bray Wyatt announcing he was setting Luke Harper and Erick Rowan "free". Rowan returned on the October 31 episode of SmackDown, while Harper returned on the November 10 episode of Raw, aligning himself with The Authority. On the November 17 episode of Raw, Rowan joined Team Cena for Survivor Series, opposing Luke Harper and turning into a heroic character. At the event, Rowan's team was victorious. During the match, Harper and Rowan attacked each other, with Rowan ultimately being eliminated from the match by his former partner (with assistance from Seth Rollins).
On the December 8 episode of Raw, Harper and Rowan faced each other in singles competition, with Harper ultimately getting himself disqualified. On the January 5, 2015 episode of Raw, The Authority punished Rowan by putting him in a singles match against Harper, with Harper picking up the win after a discus clothesline and the help of J&J Security (Jamie Noble and Joey Mercury), who were the special guest referees for the match. On the January 22 episode of SmackDown, Harper and Rowan once again competed against each other, this time in a 2015 Royal Rumble qualifying match, with Harper winning and thus not allowing Rowan to participate in the Royal Rumble match. Despite this, Rowan appeared during the Royal Rumble match on January 25, ambushing the number six entrant Curtis Axel, to attack Harper and subsequently sparking a brief Wyatt Family reunion, along with Bray Wyatt, before all three men began to brawl.
Reformation and The Wyatt Family reunion (2015–2017)
On the May 7 episode of SmackDown, Rowan would come out after Harper defeated Fandango, seemingly to confront Harper, but would instead attack Fandango and thus turning into a villain in the process. On the May 11 episode of Raw, Harper and Rowan would officially reunite when Harper accompanied Rowan to his match against Fandango which Rowan won after 30 seconds and the two proceeded to double-team Fandango after the match. On the May 18 episode of Raw, Harper and Rowan teamed up to take on Fandango and Zack Ryder, which Rowan and Harper won after a superkick and full nelson slam combination. On the June 4 episode of SmackDown, Harper and Rowan cut a promo about being ostracized and stated they were a family. On the June 5 episode of Superstars, Harper and Rowan defeated Los Matadores in a tag team match, and once again in a rematch the following week on Raw.
In late June, during a match at a live event, Rowan suffered a torn bicep, with reports saying he would be out of action for 4–6 months. On the June 23 episode of Main Event, Harper returned to single competition when he defeated Cesaro, but not before cutting a promo where he said losing his tag team partner has only made him more dangerous. Harper eventually reunited with Bray Wyatt on July 19 at Battleground by helping him defeat Roman Reigns. After four months of inactivity, Rowan returned from injury on the October 19 episode of Raw, when he filled in for Harper (who was unable to show for personal reasons) to team with Wyatt and Wyatt Family newcomer Braun Strowman, against Roman Reigns, Dean Ambrose and Seth Rollins, which his team won by disqualification after Ambrose attacked Strowman with a kendo stick. During this time, The Wyatt Family feuded with several teams including The Brothers of Destruction (The Undertaker and Kane) and Team ECW (The Dudley Boyz, Tommy Dreamer and Rhyno).
In March 2016, Harper suffered a knee injury during a Raw dark match and it was reported that the injury would sideline him for five to six months. On July 19, at the 2016 WWE draft, Wyatt and Rowan were drafted to SmackDown while Strowman was drafted to Raw, separating him from the group. After the draft, Wyatt and Rowan continued their alliance, and Harper returned at the close of the SmackDown brand's event No Mercy on October 9 in a match between Wyatt and Randy Orton, whom Harper distracted to help Wyatt win the match, thus realigning himself with the group. Prior to Harper's return, Rowan underwent surgery to repair a torn rotator cuff.
During Rowan's absence, Harper betrayed the group, attacking Wyatt and his new ally Randy Orton during the 2017 Royal Rumble. On the April 4 episode of SmackDown, Rowan returned from injury after nearly eight months of inactivity, sporting a new steampunk-style sheep mask, assisting Wyatt in attacking Orton (who had also betrayed Wyatt); Wyatt and Rowan later that went on to lose a tag team match against Orton and Harper. The Wyatt Family seemingly disbanded again when Wyatt was moved to the Raw brand during the 2017 WWE Superstar Shake-up, but despite this Wyatt and Rowan continued their alliance, with Wyatt distracting Orton during his match with Rowan on the April 11 episode of SmackDown. Harper and Rowan continued to rival each other until the feud seemingly ended at Backlash on May 21, where Harper defeated Rowan.
The Bludgeon Brothers (2017–2018)
After months without appearing on WWE programming, on the October 10 episode of SmackDown, Harper and Rowan returned in a repackaged vignette, with the duo wielding mallets and calling themselves "bludgeon brothers". During this time, both Luke Harper and Erick Rowan shortened their ring names, officially being billed as "Harper" and "Rowan". After a month of promotion, Harper and Rowan wrestled their return match as The Bludgeon Brothers on the November 21 episode of SmackDown, defeating The Hype Bros.
After multiple weeks of defeating enhancement talent in squash matches, the Bludgeon Brothers made an appearance at Fastlane on March 11, 2018, interfering during the SmackDown Tag Team Championship bout between defending champions The Usos and The New Day. This would lead to a triple threat tag team match between the three teams for the title at WrestleMania 34, where the Bludgeon Brothers won, earning their first title as a team on the main roster; this was also Rowan's first title on the main roster, and the first win at WrestleMania for both. They would go on to successfully defend the titles against The Usos at the Greatest Royal Rumble, against Luke Gallows and Karl Anderson at Money in the Bank, and against Team Hell No at Extreme Rules.
At SummerSlam, Harper and Rowan defended their titles against The New Day; they lost by disqualication after Rowan attacked Xavier Woods with a mallet, marking their first loss as The Bludgeon Brothers. Two days later on SmackDown, Rowan and Harper lost the titles to The New Day in a no-disqualification match, ending their reign at 135 days. The following day, it was announced that Rowan had suffered a torn right bicep, sidelining him indefinitely. During this time, Harper also underwent surgery due to a wrist injury.
Brief reunion and disbandment (2019)
Rowan returned alone on January 29, 2019 at the Royal Rumble pay-per-view, where he aided WWE Champion Daniel Bryan in retaining his title against AJ Styles. On March 9, 2019, Harper returned to in-ring action, defeating Mojo Rawley at a live event. Harper then wrestled at WrestleMania 35 and Worlds Collide before taking an extended hiatus from weekly television, and on April 16, requesting his release from WWE. However, at Clash of Champions on September 15, Harper returned, helping Rowan defeat Roman Reigns and reforming their alliance. The two were then defeated by Roman Reigns and Daniel Bryan at Hell in a Cell in a Tornado Tag Team Match. However, this would be their final time teaming together as during the 2019 WWE draft, Rowan was drafted to Raw while Harper remained on SmackDown.
On December 8, 2019, Luke Harper was released from his WWE contract, thus ending the possibility of Harper and Rowan teaming again in WWE. On April 15, 2020, Erick Rowan would also be released from his WWE contract as part of budget cuts stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic. Following their respective releases and after their 90-day non-compete clause had expired, Harper signed with All Elite Wrestling (AEW) under the ring name Brodie Lee, while Rowan began working on the independent circuit under the ring name Erick Redbeard.
On December 26, 2020, Jon Huber (Luke Harper/Brodie Lee) died from lung disease at the age of 41. At AEW's Brodie Lee Celebration of Life on December 30, 2020, an event memorializing Huber, Rowan appeared for the first time in AEW to pay his respects to Huber; Rowan performed a run-in to save Huber's former Dark Order teammates John Silver and Alex Reynolds and their partner Adam Page from interference by Wardlow, helping them defeat The Inner Circle's team of Maxwell Jacob Friedman, Santana and Ortiz. At the end of the match he held up a sign dedicated to his tag team partner and friend: "Goodbye for now, my brother. See you down the road."

Nemmers moved up to college officiating in 1975 and worked in the Big Ten Conference for nine years, working both football and basketball games. During his college football officiating career, Nemmers officiated in the 1984 Rose Bowl.
NFL career
Nemmers began his NFL officiating career in 1985 as a side judge, and was assigned Super Bowl XXV in 1991, his final game at that position before being promoted to referee for the start of the 1991 NFL season after Jerry Seeman and Jim Tunney announced their retirements. As a referee, he was an alternate for Super Bowl XXXV in 2001. He wore uniform number 20 throughout his entire NFL officiating career.
Memorable games
Nemmers has officiated games which involved a player breaking a statistical record. He was the referee in the January 6, 2002 game that saw Dallas Cowboys running back Emmitt Smith accumulate 1,000 yards rushing in 11 consecutive seasons, breaking a record shared with Detroit Lions running back Barry Sanders.
In another memorable moment, he was the referee in the November 27, 2005 game that saw New York Giants punter Jeff Feagles set the NFL record for consecutive games with 283, breaking the record held by Minnesota Vikings defensive end Jim Marshall.

Per Nilsson is a Swedish guitarist and producer. He is best known as one of the founding members of the melodic death metal/progressive metal band Scar Symmetry and for being the touring lead guitarist for Meshuggah during Fredrik Thordendal's 2017-2021 hiatus. He is also the guitarist for Swedish progressive rock group Kaipa and since 2017 he is the lead guitarist for Swedish power metal band Nocturnal Rites.
In January 2013, Guitar Messenger released a guitar instructional DVD with Nilsson called Scar Guitar.
Until 2013, he was endorsed by Ibanez Guitars. He is now endorsed by Strandberg Guitars, who in collaboration with him has created the Strandberg Singularity, his first signature guitar. The first version of the Singularity - a seven-string guitar with a red and black swirl finish - was released in 2014. In 2021, a new updated Singularity was released in both seven and eight string versions, with the swirl finish abandoned in favor of a sandblasted ash top with a red and black (seven string version) or blue and black (eight string version) color scheme.
Nilsson primarily plays extended range guitars, though he has often used an Ibanez JEM 6 string to record his solos in the past.
Nilsson is a member of the high IQ society Mensa International, his IQ being "135 or higher" on the Wechsler scale (which translates to 156 or higher on the Cattell scale).

The Campeonato Argentino de Básquet ("Argentine Basketball Championship" in English) is the oldest basketball competition still running in Argentina. The first edition of the tournament was held in 1928, having been played (with some interruptions) to present days. The Campeonato Argentino is played by teams representing Argentine's provincial sides.
Due to being contested by provinces all over Argentina, his competition has been called "The most Argentine championship of all".
History
The first edition of Campeonato Argentino was held in the clay court field of YMCA of Buenos Aires. Santa Fe, Córdoba and two teams from FABB took part of the tournament. Córdoba was the first team outside Buenos Aires to win a championship, in 1932 and 1933. Other provincial sides such as Santa Fe (1934-1935) and Santiago del Estero (1937, with Rafael Lledó as notable player) would win their first national titles also.
Buenos Aires Province was the most winning team between 1966 and 1978, with Bahiense players Alberto Pedro Cabrera, Atilio Fruet and José De Lizaso, plus other players from La Plata, Gehrmann, Galliadi, Sfeir, Carlos González. Buenos Aires played 13 consecutive finals, winning 10 of them.

Culham Bridge is a medieval bridge crossing a present backwater of the River Thames in England at Culham, Oxfordshire, near the town of Abingdon. The bridge crosses Swift Ditch which was at one time the main navigation channel of the River Thames until Abingdon Lock was built in 1790. The bridge formerly carried the A415 road from Abingdon to Dorchester, Oxfordshire, but was superseded in 1928 by a modern road bridge.
It is a Grade II* listed building.
History
Culham Bridge was built of stone between 1416 and 1422 to replace an ancient ford called Culham Hythe by a religious body known as The Brotherhood of Christ (later Christ's Hospital) who subsequently looked after its upkeep. It was built as part of an improvement scheme, together with the two bridges at Abingdon and a causeway across Andersey Island. It is recorded that the completion of Abingdon Bridge severely damaged trade at Wallingford.
In the early seventeenth century the Oxford-Burcot Commission constructed a lock at the top of Swift Ditch to direct navigation under Culham Bridge and this remained the main route of the Thames until Abingdon Lock was built in 1790.
During the English Civil War the bridge had considerable strategic importance. After the Royalists left Abingdon in May 1644 the Parliamentarians seized Culham Bridge, and harried the royalist food convoys on the way to Oxford. The Royalists tried to recapture the bridge and demolish it in January 1645. This resulted in a skirmish on 11 January known as the battle of Culham Bridge. Sir Henry Gage "while boldly leading his men in a third assault on the enemy... was hit by a bullet and killed".
In the eighteenth century the road was in a very bad state, leading to an Act of Parliament for its improvement. The bridge carried the main traffic until 1928, when the modern road bridge was built upstream of it and Culham Bridge became a pedestrian bridge.
During World War II two concrete pill boxes were built on the bridge, each weighing 250 tons and carrying anti-tank guns, and part of the parapet was removed to make way for a concrete platform. The bridge was subsequently restored and is classified as an ancient monument.

Los Boricuas were a professional wrestling stable that originated in the World Wrestling Federation in the late 1990s. The name was derived from a popular nickname for Puerto Rican people, since all the stable's members were from Puerto Rico. Different variants of the team have since performed in the International Wrestling Association, Dominican Wrestling Entertainment, World Wrestling League and the World Wrestling Council.
History
World Wrestling Federation (1997–1999)
The stable was led by Juan Rivera under his Savio Vega gimmick. The character formed the stable after he was expelled from the Nation of Domination. The group made its television debut in June 1997. The group featured two second-generation WWF wrestlers. The son of José Miguel Pérez, one half of WWF's first recognized tag team champions, Miguel Perez, Jr. joined after participating in Extreme Championship Wrestling and World Championship Wrestling. José Estrada, Jr. was the son of another former titlist, former WWF Junior Heavyweight Champion José Estrada. Jesús "Huracán" Castillo was a second-generation wrestler himself. They were mainly involved in angles with other stables including the Nation of Domination and the Disciples of Apocalypse. During WrestleMania XIV's tag team Battle Royal, Los Boricuas engaged two teams (Savio and Miguel, and José and Jesús), fighting on Raw is War. Vega left the group in July and would return to a singles career before being released later that summer after suffering an arm injury during the Brawl for All tournament. Castillo still a team member, became a jobber on Shotgun. Perez, Castillo and Estrada would still fight as a tag team on Raw is War and Shotgun until October 1998 and competed on Super Astros until the show ended in September 1999 and all three of them left the company. Their final match as a group took place on the August 29 episode of Super Astros, where Savio Vega returned to WWF as their manager and managed them to a win against Papi Chulo, Pantera and Apolo Dantes. On September 5, 1999, Los Boricuas made their final appearance in a backstage segment, which was the last episode of Super Astros.
International Wrestling Association (2001)
All members of The Los Boricuas including Vega reformed in 2001 in Puerto Rico's IWA, for the IWA's Tenth Anniversary show. The promotion contracted Jesús Castillo and staged a one-night reunion. At the event, Los Boricuas defeated a stable known as "La Revolución Dominicana" in a flag-on-a-pole match.
Reunions (2013–2015)
On July 1, 2013, Alejandro Franqui, the president of a promotion named Perfect Stars Wrestling (PSW) announced that its first show would serve as a homage to Los Boricuas. The event was scheduled for August 24, 2013, and would also support SER de Puerto Rico, a non-profit organization. This was followed by a series of skits where Savio Vega started recruiting the members of Los Boricuas. On the first, released on July 6, 2013, where he visited a surprised Castillo at a gym, remembering some of their time at WWF. The second aired two days later, depicting him confirming Castillo to Franqui and contacting a similarly surprised Estrada through Skype, who also confirmed his presence. This marked Estrada's first wrestling-related appearance in years. The final segment was published on July 9, 2013, instead featuring Pérez randomly entering Vega's office and confirming that he was going to join his fellow Boricuas. Like with Estrada, Pérez was abandoning a prolonged period of inactivity, making his first appearance in over a year since performing as president of the IWA. However, when the promotion's debut was postponed, this homage was cancelled. On July 19, 2013, Los Boricuas joined the World Wrestling League (WWL), with all but Estrada joining the promotion's roster. In storyline, they were recruited to feud with the AAA World Trios Champions, Los Psycho Circus. The first encounter between both teams concluded without a clear winner, being ruled a double countout. On September 8, 2013, Los Boricuas defeated Los Psycho Circus.
On June 15, 2014, Castillo reappeared in the World Wrestling Council, where he joined Pérez. This variant was recognized as another reunion of Los Boricuas and was alternatively called "The Caribbean Express". At Summer Madness, Pérez and Castillo defeated a team known as Los Templarios to win the WWC World Tag Team Championship. The following week, Castillo lost a single match that enabled a rematch for the titles. On July 11, 2015, independent promotion New Wrestling Revolution announced that another incarnation of Los Boricuas formed by Vega and Pérez would be appearing in an event named Summer Revolution held weeks later. Performing as heels, the tag team was brought in to work a feud with a stable known as La Revolución.

Daði Guðmundsson ( – 1563) or Daði of Snóksdal was a farmer and magistrate in 16th century Iceland. He lived in the town of Snóksdalur in Dalasýsla county and played an important role in the Battle of Sauðafell and the Lutheran Reformation in Iceland.
Personal life
Daði was a son of the farmer Guðmund Finnsson and Þórunn Daðadóttir, who was related by marriage to Torfi Arason, the king's representative (hirðstjóri) for the north and west of Iceland. Daði was a prosperous landholder with successful fishing operations based on the Hvammsfjörður. Knut Gjerset, in his History of Iceland, describes Daði as a "rich and influential man of shady morals."
In 1525, Daði married Guðrún, daughter of Einar Ölduhryggjarskáld, a poet and priest. Guðrún's brothers Marteinn Einarsson, the second Lutheran bishop of Iceland, and the sýslumenn (who plays an important role in the ensuing struggle because in "his travels on the continent had learned some of the art of fortification.") and Brandur Einarsson, known as Gleraugna-Pétur and Moldar-Brandur respectively, also played prominent roles in spread of Lutheranism in Iceland.
The Battle of Sauðafell
Catholic Bishop Jón Arason, who strenuously opposed efforts to promote Lutheranism in Iceland, considered Daði and Gleraugna-Pétur as his main opponents. In January 1549, Jón excommunicated Daði and then went with a contingent of soldiers to capture him, sacking three of Daði's estates in the process. Daði, who had 50 to 80 men under arms with him at Snóksdal in the spring of 1549, resisted the attempt and remained free. In autumn 1550, Jón and his sons, Ara and Birni, took an army of 100 men and captured Daði's estate at Sauðafell. Daði raised a large body of men and at the Battle of Sauðafell surprised Jón and his men, capturing them.
Later life
Daði continued his life as a wealthy man, holding numerous properties and a large number of cattle, as well as six ships. He also served as steward of the land of the monastery.
Daði and Guðrún's only child was their daughter, Þórunn, who drowned with her husband Birni Hannesson in 1554, leaving three young children to inherit Daði's assets when he died in 1563. Daði also had several children by Ingveldur Árnadóttir, but it was Guðrún and Þórunn who inherited most of his wealth.

Ron Marshall was a St. James-Assiniboia School Trustee from 1992 to 2006, and chaired the board's finance committee for a time. In 1993, he criticized as inaccurate a University of Manitoba report that suggested Winnipeg residents did not trust the city's public school system. Two years later, he opposed his board's decision to close Jameswood School, saying that its low teacher-student ratio made it the envy of other schools in the city. In 2001, he supported a new theatre project for Sturgeon Creek Collegiate. He retired in 2006. Marshall supported the "consensus approach" of the St. James-Assiniboia board, and said that trustees should avoid partisan politics.
Sandra Paterson-Greene first campaigned for a seat on the St. James-Assiniboia School Board in 1986 under the name Sandra Paterson, and was narrowly defeated for the final position. She was elected in 1995, and re-elected in 1998, 2002 and 2006. Paterson-Greene has served as chair of the Assiniboia-St. James board's education and divisional multipurpose committees. In 2001-02, she spearheaded an effort to build a new theatre at Sturgeon Creek Collegiate. The board rejected the proposal in September 2002, by a vote of 6-3. In early 2003, she called on the federal government to toughen its laws against marijuana.
Electors could vote for three candidates. Percentages are determined in relation to the total number of votes.

Eswatini (known at the time as Swaziland) remained a British protectorate throughout World War II. As such, it fought alongside the Allies against the Axis. While no large scale battles or major military operations took place in or around Eswatini, the colony did supply the Allies with troops during the war. World War II was also responsible for several important domestic developments in Eswatini.
History
Sobhuza II, the King of Eswatini at the time the war broke out, struck a deal with the British government, agreeing to help gather volunteers for the war effort within the country in exchange for the British allowing for greater Swazi autonomy in the future. A few thousand Swazi men ended up volunteering to fight alongside the Allies. Swazis enlisted into the African Auxiliary Pioneer Corps which went on to serve in Egypt and Libya during the Western Desert campaign, part of the larger North Africa campaign, and also participated in the Allied invasion of Italy. One notable Swazi veteran of the war is Mnikwa Dlamini, who later became the Chief of Hhelehhele.
Domestically, World War II led directly to the Swazi government's implementation of new administrative subdivisions in Eswatini called tinkhundla. Those Swazi soldiers who served in the war and had spent time in modern African port cities like Tripoli and Durban relayed their wartime experiences to King Sobhuza II and recommended to their monarch that he establish several community centers across the kingdom. These community centers, called inkhundla, eventually developed into the tinkhundla system found in Eswatini today. Swazi veterans of World War II also influenced their home country in that they eventually came to occupy several important leadership positions within the Swazi military.
The political and economic situation of the post-war world eventually allowed Eswatini to gain independence from the British Empire in 1968, as part of a much larger trend of decolonization across the world.
A memorial to Swazi soldiers who served in World War II was constructed near the mission of Bethany, located just outside of the town of Matsapha. The memorial records the names of 53 Swazi soldiers who died after returning to their home country, as well as those of 24 Swazi soldiers who died in Egypt. All Swazi soldiers not mentioned by name elsewhere are commemorated on the memorial's plaque, written in Siswati.

The Chieftain Hotel is a historic former hotel building at 38 Pearl Street in Council Bluffs, Iowa, United States. It opened in 1927, the result of a partnership between the Eppley Hotel Company and local patrons, and was built on the site of the Grand Hotel, which had opened in 1891 and was destroyed by a fire in 1925. The hotel was eight stories tall, and featured 153 guest rooms.
Eppley owned and operated the hotel until 1956, when the chain was sold to Sheraton, which sold it off, along with several other Eppley hotels. After some management and ownership changes, it went into receivership to the First National Bank of Council Bluffs in 1966 and closed in 1970.
It originally had two restaurants: The Terrace Cafe and the Java Room, and a cocktail lounge named The Ruby Room. All were located on the lobby level, and both the Java Room and Ruby Room were accessible from the street as well as from the hotel. The Terrace Cafe featured a Loggia which looked out on Bayliss Park across the street, and was decorated in the Adam style . During the Depression, The Terrace Cafe was converted to a banquet room. It remained a banquet room for the remainder of the time the hotel operated.
The bobby was situated along the south side of the building and was a two-story space open to the mezzanine above.
The second level consisted of four private dining rooms (Corn Room, State Suite, Pioneer Room, and The Beaux Arts Room) on the Pearl Street side of the building, and the Trianon Ballroom. In addition, a u-shaped mezzanine area adjacent to the Ballroom looked down onto the lobby below. The Corn Room and the Pioneer Room, were decorated with Murals painted by Iowa Artist Grant Wood.
The Trianon Ballroom is named after a palace near Versailles, France, and could seat upwards of 500 guests. It was one of the original performance spaces for Council Bluffs' Chanticleer Community Theatre.
After the hotel closed, the lobby and Terrace Cafe space were partitioned off and served as the Council Bluffs Elk's Club for many years, and the Java Room became a Godfather's Pizza. The former Ruby Room cocktail lounge has been used for many purposes, including congressional offices. The private dining rooms were converted to apartments, but the Ballroom remains intact.
The facility is now known as Bluffs Towers, a low-income apartment house, primarily for senior citizens and people with disabilities. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2014.

The Royal Academy () is the official school for music, dance, and theater in China between the Tang Dynasty and Ming Dynasty, lasting more than 1000 years.
History
In the 7th Century, the Chinese Royal Academy was set up by Emperor Gaozu of Tang in the purpose to teach music, theater, and dance for court entertainment. The name of the Royal Academy at first was Private Academy (Chinese: 內教坊), coordinated by the Tai-Chang Temple (Chinese: 太常寺, the central religion administration for the royal family). In the years of Empress Wu Zetian, the Private Academy was once called Yun-Shao Palace (Chinese: 雲韶府, which means the place of cloud and sunlight). Finally, Emperor Zhongzong of Tang renamed the academy to the Royal Academy. In the meantime, he made the school independent with a new governmental official similar to the western Kapellmeister to guide.

The latter part of the 19th century was a period of agrarian unrest in the Midwestern United States. From 1865 to 1896, farmer protests led to the formation of organized movements including the Grange, the Populist Party, the Greenbacks, and other alliances. Farmers cited the reasons for their unhappiness as declining prices, decreasing purchasing power, and monopolistic practices of: 1) moneylenders, 2) railroad corporations, and 3) other middlemen. Recent research has led scholars to question the validity of these explanations. Currently there is no scholarly consensus on the causes of agrarian discontent.
Uncertainty
A factor that contributed to the price volatility of farm products was related to supply-demand. Farm output increased as more people settled in the west. Part of this settlement can be attributed to: the influx of immigrants, the Homestead Act, and railroad construction. Productivity also increased with the advent of advances in agricultural machinery. Many prices for products such as cotton, wheat, and corn, fluctuated significantly as productivity increased.
Some scholars point to price volatility during this period as a major cause of farmer discontent. There is evidence linking price volatility to protest within states. A major reason for price volatility was globalization; the development of other countries (Australia, Argentina, South Africa, Ukraine, Russia, and India) entering the market as major suppliers of agricultural products. If the United States were to have a bumper harvest, while Argentina or Eastern Europe had a poor harvest, then the commodity prices and incomes in the United States would rise. Similarly, if the United States had a poor year but Argentina had a good harvest, then the prices and incomes would fall in the United States.
Transportation was the main concern for farmers during this time. The commercialization of agriculture was facilitated by railroad transportation. Farmers complained of the high freight rates, but the available evidence contradicts the rationale. Yet real transport costs fell steadily throughout the post bellum era, but there is some evidence that the farmers were not benefitting from the lower rates. Farmers in the west were shipping their produce farther distances to market than those farmers in the east, additionally, the ton-mile rates were often much higher west of Chicago than the rates from Chicago to New York City. The data indicate that mean prices and mean incomes per acre were linked to the distance from New York City. Farmers in high protest states faced high price variability due to the pattern of prices that was influenced by the railroad network that linked the states. Although, there is evidence that the drop in transportation costs caused farmers with suitable soils to diversify their crops in order to take advantage of relative farm gate prices.
This volatility in prices was compounded by a post bellum shift into monocultures. Farmers that once relied on diversified farming found it profitable to produce only one crop for market sale. This was especially apparent in the South as farmers shifted away from diversified corn and cotton portfolios into solely cotton.
Commercialization
Commercialization was a main component behind agrarian unrest. During this time, farmers engaged in the market production as the relative profitability increased. The purchase of agricultural inputs and goods that were formerly home-produced was acquired with credit. Farmers had to sell their produce at market and subsequently were enveloped in the commercial market system. Thus, the farmer was forced into paying for transportation and credit in order to sell his produce at a high enough price so that he could pay for his inputs. The farmer also now had to judge himself by success of being a businessman and not just a farmer. It has also been noted that the farmers were upset at their depreciating status in society. While they were once a majority of voice in the United States, they were now a minority due to the continued industrialization and urbanization of the nation.
Social movements
The unrest enabled many movements to appear on the political scene. The largest were the Grange, Greenback, and Populist movements. The Grange movement, which was organized in 1867, focused primarily on regulating railroads, grain elevators, and other middlemen and monopolies that they thought were taking advantage of the farmer. The most active states for the Grange movement were Illinois, Iowa, Minnesota and Wisconsin.
The Greenback movement peaked in the late 1870s; it campaigned for: higher agricultural prices, against the gold standard, and for a general increase in prices. The states with the most Greenback activity, as a form of agrarian unrest, were Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, and Wisconsin.
The Populist Party, which was formed in the 1890s, which were most active in Kansas, Nebraska, and the Dakotas, was a short lived party that campaigned on the regulation of businesses, transportation charges, and monetary issues.

The frontal crest of the frontal bone ends below in a small notch which is converted into a foramen, the foramen cecum (or foramen caecum), by articulation with the ethmoid.
The foramen cecum varies in size in different subjects, and is frequently impervious; when open, it transmits the emissary vein from the nose to the superior sagittal sinus. This has clinical importance in that infections of the nose and nearby areas can be transmitted to the meninges and brain from what is known as the danger triangle of the face.

The Repoblación (, ; , ) was the ninth-century repopulating of a large region between the River Duero and the Cantabrian Mountains, which had been depopulated in the early years of the Reconquista.
In the reign of Alfonso I of Asturias (739–757), through a series of successful military campaigns against the Moors, the Christians had retaken Galicia, La Rioja, and León and brought the population of the northern regions firmly under their control. This left those provinces largely empty of human settlement and created a buffer zone between Moors and Christians. This region was called the Desert of the Duero. This zone was left untouched for almost a century while Alfonso's successors focused their energies on Vasconia and Galicia.
It was during the reign of Ordoño I of Asturias (850–866) that the repopulation of the uninhabited zone began. Ordoño began advancing to the south, repopulating the cities of Tui, Astorga, León, and Amaya. The people who descended the mountains of the north for the uninhabited valleys were called foramontanos, meaning "out of the mountains." Among the routes the foramontanos took was that between Cabuérniga and Campo de Suso, which was followed as early as 824, when the new population of Brañosera received the oldest known fuero in Spanish history.
The desire for newer, more fertile agricultural zones in the river valleys of the Ebro and Duero was the chief driving factor in the emigrations. From this time the kingdom increasingly became known as that of León and in 910, on the death of Ordoño's son, Alfonso III, the kingdom was divided with Fruela II continuing to reign in the Asturias while his brothers García and Ordoño ruled in León and Galicia respectively. The repoblación was then complete.
Despite this, Desert of the Duero was never completely depopulated, since archaeological research has shown a limited continuity of occupation.
The Portuguese Repovoação occurred during the reigns of the House of Burgundy up to the middle of the thirteenth century.

Sylvia Field (born Harriet Louisa Johnson; February 14, 1901 – July 31, 1998) was an American actress whose career encompassed performances on stage, screen, and TV. She was best known for playing the understanding Mrs. Martha Wilson (Mr. Wilson's wife) on the television sitcom Dennis the Menace on CBS from 1959 to 1962.
Early life and career
Born in Allston, Massachusetts, she attended Arlington High School in Arlington, Massachusetts. Field began her acting career on the stage. She made her Broadway debut at age 17 in 1918 in The Betrothal (1918). After appearing in various stage productions, Field made her film debut in the 1928 drama The Home Girl.
Her other films included Voice of the City (1929), Nobody's Darling (1943), Junior Miss (1945) and All Mine to Give (1957).
Field began appearing in guest spots on television in the late 1940s. In 1949, she starred in a locally produced sitcom about her life, The Truex Family. In 1952, she landed the role of Mrs. Remington in the sitcom Mister Peepers. The show, which aired until 1955, co-starred Field's real-life husband Ernest Truex. After the end of Mr. Peepers, Field continued to guest star on episodic television, including in roles on Producers' Showcase, Star Tonight, General Electric Theater, and The Ann Sothern Show. In 1957, Field made a guest appearance on Perry Mason as defendant Belle Adrian in "The Case of the Angry Mourner." In 1958, she played Aunt Lila in the Walt Disney serial Annette, starring Annette Funicello.
In 1959, Field began appearing in her most noted role as Martha Wilson in the CBS sitcom Dennis the Menace. Field's character was written out of the series in 1962 owing to the death of Joseph Kearns, who portrayed George Wilson, Martha's husband. Field continued in television guest spots during the 1960s, including on the ABC sitcoms Our Man Higgins with Stanley Holloway and Hazel.
In 1966, Sylvia appeared on Petticoat Junction as Laura Bentley in the episode: "Young Love". She played opposite her real life husband Ernest Truex.

In 1941, Field married actor Ernest Truex, to whom she remained married for 32 years until Truex's death in 1973. Field was a Democrat who supported the campaign of Adlai Stevenson during the 1952 presidential election.

St Wilfrid's School is a private and non-selective day school for girls and boys aged 3–16 in the city of Exeter in Devon, England. The school has been in existence for over 140 years following the education act of 1870. Their motto is "The little school with a big personality".
History
St Wilfrid's was founded by The Reverend John Gilberd Pearse, Rector of All Hallows-on-the-Wall Church, in 1870 following the introduction of the Elementary Education Act making education compulsory for all children. Initially named the 'Forty School' due to having forty spaces, the school was attended by many children attending school for the first time. In 1890 the school moved into rooms at the Mint Methodist Church because it needed larger premises, and numbers quickly doubled.
In 1950 the orphanage run by the Sisters of St Wilfrid's on St David's Hill closed. Having outgrown the space at the Mint, the Junior School moved into Sandford Hall and the Senior school moved into the old orphanage, its present location.
Until 1967 St Wilfrid's was primarily a girls' school although some boys were admitted in the lower years. However, in 1967, following the closure of Mount Radford School, the decision was made for St Wilfrid's school to become fully co-educational and so it became the first independent co-educational school in Exeter.
During the 70's and 80's, St Wilfrid's pupils were well known for taking food parcels to elderly residents of local almshouses and singing Christmas Carols in the High Street. For many years traffic was stopped as pupils processed to Exeter Cathedral for an annual St Wilfrid's Day service every October.
Up until 1988 the school had been taught entirely by nuns, however, with increasing curriculum demands it was decided they were no longer able to fully run the school and so the Senior department became a separate school with its own head-teacher and financial control. The Junior department continued under the Sisters' leadership for a while longer until by 1994 there were only two remaining Sisters: Sister Elsie (who died in 1997) and Reverend Mother Lillian (who died in 2004 at the age of 107) at which point the juniors rejoined the seniors and moved into the current site on St David's Hill.
Today the school still has senior and junior classes, and also runs a Montessori pre-prep within the grounds of the school.
The current proprietor, Mrs Alexandra Macdonald-Dent, stepped down as headmistress in 2017, to be replaced by the current headmaster, Mr Bovingdon.
Academic environment
As standards of education were not so high in late Victorian times, the early curriculum was limited by the abilities of the Sisters teaching there. As standards improved and more subjects were introduced, the Sisters became trained as professional teachers and were joined by specialist teachers to cover the more demanding subjects. By the 1930s Science, Mathematics, History, R.E., Geography and Sports along with the original "three Rs" formed the school syllabus, and older pupils began to take external examinations.
Today the school offers a wide range of academic subjects including separate sciences from year 7, and numerous extra-curricular activities including sports and creative arts. 'SWOP', St Wilfrid's Outdoor Pursuits, provides opportunities for the students to go on walks and outdoor activities with the school, and take part in externally arranged challenges such as the Sidmouth Saunter. Students also take part in the Duke of Edinburgh Award Scheme or the Ten Tors weekend on Dartmoor.
Academic standards
The school was inspected by Ofsted in October 2017; their report evaluated the school as being 'Good' in all areas (Overall Effectiveness; Effectiveness of leadership and Management; Quality of Teaching; Learning and Assessment; Personal Development, Behaviour and Welfare; Outcomes for pupils; Early Years provision). The report concluded that "Leaders have created a school community where relationships between staff and pupils are deeply rooted in mutual respect", and "pupils make strong progress from their different starting points. A large proportion of pupils arrive working below age-related expectations but they quickly start to catch up."
At Key Stage 1/2, pupils study Maths, English, French, Science, History, Geography, Drama, Music, Art, Home Economics, RE, PE, Games, ICT and PSME/Citizenship.
Key Stage 3 follows a similar pattern with the addition of Italian.
For Key Stage 4, the key subjects are English Language/Literature, Maths, French and/or German and Science. Choices include Media Studies, Geography, History, Art and PE.

Sherman Converse (April 17, 1790 – December 10, 1873) was an American publisher.
Converse was born in Thompson, Conn., April 17, 1790. He graduated from Yale College in 1813. Soon after graduating he settled in New Haven, and became proprietor and editor of the Connecticut Journal, and the head of the largest publishing house in New England. He published, among other works, the Christian Spectator, Silliman's Journal, and Swift's Digest; and in 1828 Noah Webster's American Dictionary, the first quarto edition in two large volumes, from the original manuscript, and under the supervision of the author. This last was a work of great magnitude, requiring a heavy outlay of means and labor, and making a notable event in the history of the American press. Converse removed to the city of New York in 1828, and was for several years actively engaged in business of various kinds, both in this country and in Canada.
About the year 1850 he became crippled by a severe attack of rheumatism, which made him an invalid for the rest of his life, and for ten years before his death he never left his room. Besides suffering from disease, he was sorely tried by grave financial embarrassments, but he bore
all his trials with the patience and resignation of a true Christian. Since the spring of 1863, Converse resided with his son in Boston Highlands, Mass. He died, December 10, 1873, after an illness of three days.
He was married, in 1820, to Ann Huntington Perkins, daughter of Samuel Perkins, of Windham, Conn., who, with an infant child, died in the summer of 1821. In 1824 he married Eliza, daughter of the Rev. Samuel Nott, D.D., of Franklin, Conn. She died in 1845, leaving one son, a graduate of Yale, in 1850.

The Basel Connecting Line () is a railway line in the Swiss city of Basel and connects Basel Baden station on the right bank of the Rhine and Basel SBB station on the left bank. It is located on Swiss territory.
Most of the German long-distance trains on the Rhine Valley Railway end at Basel SBB station and run along the Connecting Line. Many Regional-Express trains of Deutsche Bahn (from Freiburg) and S-Bahn trains of the SBB GmbH (from Zell) also run over the Connecting Line to Basel SBB.
History
The railway line was authorised by Article 4 of an international agreement of 15 October 1869, concerning the construction and operation of the Gotthard Railway. The building of the Connecting Line was licensed by the Swiss federal government on 14 March 1870. On 3 November 1873 the line was opened, including a one-line bridge over the Rhine. Following an agreement between the then Swiss Central Railway and the Grand Duchy of Baden State Railways, the Connecting Line was built as a joint line by both companies. The project was exclusively funded by the Central Railway, which became its owner and it is now owned by the Swiss Federal Railways (SBB). Since the railway reform, the rail infrastructure is managed exclusively by the SBB. SBB, Deutsche Bahn and many other companies operate on the line. The property boundary is at the 3.537 km chainage mark (at the north head of the Rhine bridge).
Technology
The Basel Connecting Line, including railway Basel Baden station, Basel SBB station and Basel marshalling yard is equipped for Swiss locomotives without special technical equipment and can be used by services from Germany. The line is equipped with the German intermittent cab signalling system (Punktförmige Zugbeeinflussung) and the Swiss train protection system (Integra-Signum). Train runs on the right, unlike elsewhere in the SBB network, in order to avoid the need to switch sides at Basel Baden station. The overhead line can be used by trains with both Swiss and German pantographs (maximum lateral deviation of 200 mm). The border between the overhead electrification systems is at the property boundary.

Ways and Means (Greek: Πόροι ἢ περὶ Προσόδων, Poroi e peri Prosodon, "Revenues") was written in 355 BC and is believed to be the last work written by Xenophon. This was shortly after Athens' defeat in the Social War and the collapse of the Second Athenian League, and the city was facing financial ruin. Ways and Means is made up of 6 chapters, addressed to the Council of Five Hundred in response to political statements that expressed that Athens' unfair behavior against other cities is due to its poverty. The essay consists of suggestions to alleviate the economic situation in Athens at this time. Xenophon proposes through Ways and Means that Athens would be able to support itself without relying on the profits of war and empire. There are different receptions of this work, but mainly agreed upon is that this was an attempt to create a new type of imperialism that was supported more by peace and Athens itself instead of oppressive behavior on other cities.
Chapter 1
In chapter 1, Xenophon lists the natural qualities of Athens that should allow it to have a sufficient income. Xenophon lists reasons such as the abundance of natural resources like stone and silver in Attica as sources of revenue. Another point was that tamer seasons in the region allowed for higher agricultural capabilities. Xenophon also references that Athens is in a central location in Greece, good for trade by land and sea and isolated from barbarians.
Chapter 2
In chapter 2, Xenophon suggests that Athens should increase the population of metics as a means of increasing revenue. Xenophon identifies metics as a prime source of revenue due to their obligation to pay taxes to the city of Athens. He suggests incentivizing the foreigners by decreasing their duties required of them to stay in Athens and building loyalty to the city. Specifically, he brings up alleviating the metics of their duties as infantry for the city to decrease the payment that Athens has to make to them for their service, while keeping their payments and also making the Athenian infantry completely consisting of citizens. Other incentives that Xenophon suggests are privileges such as granting the metics the ability to serve in the cavalry and own land within the walls of Athens.
Chapter 3
In chapter 3, Xenophon brings up the reasons why Athens would be a great commercial center and therefore increase revenue through exports, sales, rents and customs. He states that trading through Athens would be the best and most secure for the traders especially, because Athens' currency is already distributed among different regions in Greece. Similar to the ideas brought up in the previous chapter, Xenophon suggests incentivizing trading with Athens by making markets more fair in managing disputes and to reserve front row seats in theaters for merchants. He states that changes are also relatively low cost to the financial gain that the city will see. Other ideas to increase trade were such as creating a fleet of public trading ships owned by the state to loan out to merchants.
Chapter 4
In chapter 4, Xenophon touches on the silver mines and the slaves that worked there. He believed that with proper operation, the revenue that silver will bring to Athens will increase immensely. Xenophon reasons that an increase in the workforce in the silver mining industry will bring large amounts of wealth, where increasing work power in agriculture will simply result in a plateau of work efficiency. Therefore, he states that Athens should open up their mining industry to foreigners as well as citizens. He also reasons that as there is an endless demand for silver, as consumers would buy more silver as long as they can afford to, increasing revenue. He also suggests the public ownership of slaves, and to gain revenue by loaning them out.
Chapter 5
In chapter 5, Xenophon insinuates the importance of peace to obtain the full economic advantages of the state. He suggests instating a board of peace, which would increase the state's attractiveness to guests from other states. Xenophon argues that Athens in a peace is the most attractive location to all types of visitors and therefore should not attempt to control other states by force. Xenophon supposes that Athens would gain the support of Greece if they wanted to act as an enforcer of peace. He also states that he does not know clearly whether peace is more profitable than war, but that from past experiences, peace has seen more money sent to the treasury where war saw more money leave the treasury.
Chapter 6
In chapter 6, Xenophon concludes his essay by reminding the council about the wonders that the changes he proposed would bring to Athens. He entices the council about the magnificent festivals that would be held with increased revenue and increased security and quality of life for the citizens. He also warns the council, however, that they should send for Delphi to ask the gods whether this is the correct path for Athens to continue on. He ends the essay, saying that with the blessings of the gods, Athens action would impact positively, making it wealthy once again.

Sir Bernard Ingham (born 21 June 1932) is a British journalist and former civil servant. He was Margaret Thatcher's chief press secretary throughout her time as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom from 1979 to 1990. He was knighted in Thatcher's 1990 resignation honours list.
Background
Ingham was educated at Hebden Bridge Grammar School, leaving at the age of 16 to join the Hebden Bridge Times newspaper, for whom he continued to write until 2013. He attended Bradford Technical College on day release as part of the studies required to qualify for the Certificate of Training for Junior Journalists, which he describes as being "taken rather seriously in early post-war Britain". He went on to work for the Yorkshire Evening Post, the Yorkshire Post, latterly as Northern industrial correspondent (1952–1961), and The Guardian (1962–1967). While a reporter at the Yorkshire Post, Ingham was an active member of the National Union of Journalists, and vice chairman of its Leeds branch. He is also likely to have been the anonymous and aggressively anti-Conservative columnist "Albion" for the Leeds Weekly Citizen, a Labour Party publication, from 1964 to 1967.
In 1967, Ingham joined the Civil Service, working as a press and public relations officer and director of Information in various Government departments, including the Department of Energy, 1974–77, where he also served as Under-Secretary in the Energy Conservation Division, 1978–79.
Ingham's father was a Labour Party councillor for Hebden Royd Town Council and he was himself a member of the Labour Party until he joined the Civil Service. Ingham contested the then safe Conservative Moortown ward of Leeds City Council in the 1965 council elections for the Labour Party, having been nominated by the Fabian Society.
Press secretary to Margaret Thatcher
Ingham spent 11 years as Margaret Thatcher's chief press secretary in No. 10 Downing Street when she was Prime Minister. In 1979–90 he was also head of the Government Information Office. In the course of his civil service career he was also press secretary to Barbara Castle, Robert Carr, Maurice Macmillan, Lord Carrington, Eric Varley and Tony Benn.
Although a career civil servant, Ingham gained a reputation for being a highly effective propagandist for the Thatcherite cause. The phrase spin doctor did not enter common parlance until after his retirement, but he was nevertheless considered a gifted exponent in what came to be known as the "black arts" of spin.
In those days, Downing Street briefings were "off the record", meaning that information given out by Ingham could be attributed only to "senior government sources". Occasionally he used this deniability to brief against the government's own ministers, such as when he described the leader of the House of Commons John Biffen as a "semi-detached" member of the government. Biffen was dropped at the next reshuffle. This blurring of the distinction between his nominally neutral role as a civil servant and a more partisan role as apologist and promoter of Margaret Thatcher's policies led Christopher Hitchens to characterise Ingham as "a nugatory individual" and to criticise what he saw as the negative consequences of Ingham's time as Thatcher's press secretary: "During his time in office, Fleet Street took several steps towards an American system of Presidentially-managed coverage and sound-bite deference, without acquiring any of the American constitutional protection in return."
In 1987 Downing Street berated The Sun newspaper in a storm over honours. Thatcher was said to be furious, and Ingham, the Prime Minister's Press Secretary, sent correspondence to The Sun asking it to explain why the honours list, given in confidence, had been published.
In 1989, three years after the Westland helicopter scandal led to the resignation of Defence Secretary Michael Heseltine, former cabinet minister Leon Brittan revealed in a Channel 4 programme that Ingham was one of two senior Downing Street officials who had approved the leaking of a crucial letter from the Solicitor General Patrick Mayhew, in which he questioned some of the statements that Heseltine had made about the takeover contest of the Westland helicopter company. Brittan's claim that Ingham and Charles Powell had approved the leak of the letter led to calls from some Labour MPs for there to be a new inquiry into the Westland affair.
Ingham was knighted on Thatcher's resignation – and retirement – in 1990. His successor as press secretary was Gus O'Donnell, who went on to become Cabinet secretary and head of the Civil service in 2005.
Ingham's book Kill the Messenger, concerning his time as press secretary, was not well received. Paul Foot, a Marxist journalist, commented that "... there is no information in this book. I picked it up eagerly, refusing to believe that someone so close to the top for so long could fail to reveal, even by mistake, a single interesting piece of information" and he was particularly scathing about Ingham's prose style, offering the following quotation from Kill the Messenger as representative of Ingham's use of English: "Like a mighty oak, it took more than one axe to bring Mrs Thatcher down. In November 1990 they were cutting into this solid timber from all angles. The frenzy was fearsome to behold. Heaven preserve us from political axe-men in a state of panic. They would cut off their grandmas in their prime if they thought it would serve their interests. And so they cut off a grandma in her international prime by the stocking tops, to borrow one of Denis's phrases, which Mrs Thatcher often used."
In a commentary in the Daily Express in April 2009, Ingham referred to Thatcher as "reckless" and a battler for Britain. He said her greatest quality was that she did not want to be loved and she came to office without a Press Secretary and had "the enormous will" to overcome "defeatist inertia", such as: "Oh you can't do that Prime Minister, they won't allow it". He attended her funeral in April 2013.
Television script
Ingham helped Thatcher in the writing of the Yes Minister sketch which she performed in public with Paul Eddington and Nigel Hawthorne.
In December 2001 Ingham said, on the death of Hawthorne, "Margaret Thatcher's fascination was with the games between the elected politician and the unelected official".

Ingham holds the position of Vice President of Country Guardian, an anti-wind energy campaign group. Ingham is also a regular panellist on BBC current affairs programme Dateline London.
He has also been secretary to Supporters of Nuclear Energy (SONE, 1998–2007), a group of individuals who seek to promote nuclear power in the United Kingdom.
Despite never having attended university himself, Ingham lectured in public relations at Middlesex University.
Brass Eye
Ingham appeared on the satirical television programme, Brass Eye. He was persuaded to appear in a short sequence, in which he issued a stern warning to young people about the dangers of a purported new drug, "cake", one of several celebrities who appeared not to recognise the satirical nature of the programme. Ingham said that "several people have actually been brained by saucepans used to make this kind of Cake", before asking viewers to "use their cheese-box" and "say no, never".
Controversies
Court case
On 8 March 1999, Ingham was bound over to keep the peace at Croydon Magistrates' Court after he was accused of causing criminal damage to a Mercedes car owned by Linda Cripps, a neighbour, in Purley, south London. The charges were dropped when Ingham agreed to accept being bound over for 12 months in the sum of £1,000 to keep the peace and be of good behaviour. Ingham denied that he had caused any damage to the vehicle. The court was told that Cripps told Ingham: "You have damaged my car", to which he replied "Good, I'm glad". Ingham denied he had damaged the car and said, "I did not cause the damage complained of and to resolve the issue I accepted advice that I should agree to be bound over. I have paid £792 to cover the cost of the alleged damage to the car." Cripps's husband said after the case "We are weary of the constant bombardment that we have suffered. We are no match for Sir Bernard Ingham. Let's hope that he will now allow us to get on with our lives peacefully".
Hillsborough
In a letter addressed to a parent of a victim of the 1989 Hillsborough disaster, Ingham reiterated his belief that the disaster was caused by "tanked up yobs", a view later entirely refuted by the Hillsborough inquest. In a letter written to a Liverpool FC supporter, Ingham remarked that people should "shut up about Hillsborough". In 1996 on Question Time, Ingham spoke with what was later claimed to be "hate in his voice" in favour of compensating the police present at the time of the disaster, saying: "If thousands of ticketless fans had not turned up and pushed their way into the ground then the whole scenario would not have occurred." "You can't get away from what you were told," Ingham said. "We talked to a lot of people; I am not sure if it was the chief constable. That was the impression I gathered: there were a lot of tanked-up people outside." Speaking to The Guardian, he confirmed that this was what he was told when he and Thatcher were shown round, although he could not recall if South Yorkshire police's chief constable, Peter Wright, had said it personally.
Hebden Bridge residents launched a campaign against Ingham to have him removed as a local newspaper columnist over his continued refusal to apologise for his words in the immediate aftermath of the Hillsborough disaster. He continued to write articles until February 2013. On 26 April 2016, a jury gave the verdict that the 96 killed at Hillsborough were unlawfully killed and that the Liverpool fans behaviour did not contribute to the dangerous situation at the turnstiles. Ingham refused to apologise or respond to the previous comments he made, which has led to petitions being created on change.org and petitions.parliament.uk, the official website for government petitions.
Comments on Scotland and Northerners
Ingham derided Scottish nationalists as being "as greedy as sin", stating that "the only thing that fuelled nationalism was the smell of oil and money in oil", suggesting that any nationalist sentiments were merely a disguised form of greed. In November 2013, a defiant Ingham reiterated his attack on "thick" Northerners who don't vote Tory.
Thatcher's papers
In March 2011, it was reported by The Independent that Policy chief Sir Keith Joseph said in public the view that Margaret Thatcher's first year in Downing Street had been "wasted". Joseph's press secretary reported this to Ingham. In his reply, contained in a letter dated 1 December 1980, he said, Thatcher was "quite relaxed about it", adding: "I believe she agrees with Sir Keith but for the sake of the government and confidence in it does not say so."

Dulce Ilusión (English title:Sweet Illusion) is a Venezuelan telenovela written by Mariela Romero and produced by Radio Caracas Televisión in 1993. This was the first telenovela to use Venezuelan cartoons with real people, and it's the only one in the history of Venezuelan soap operas, and the great success of the telenovela was partly due to the big innovation of the cartoons. The animated characters were developed by the legendary animator Felix Nakamura and his team.
Coraima Torres and Gabriel Fernández starred as the main protagonists with the antagonistic participation of Marisela Berti.
Synopsis
Dulce María was born in the midst of the tropics, and when her parents die, she becomes the heiress to their lands and vast fortune. However, her ruthless governess Zarina robs her of her rightful inheritance and raises Dulce María as a servant in her own home, convincing her that she had been born a penniless orphan.
Despite her stepmother's cruelty, Dulce María grows to become a young woman full of optimism and innocence. Her genuine nature wins the hearts of many of the townspeople, especially the local children. Among This is Caraotica, an unforgettable boy with strange powers; in reality, Caraotica is an angel who inadvertently "fell" into the convent's backyard while on a mission from heaven to Villa del Mar. Sor Ada, the nun who educated Dulce María, becomes her confidante and greatest source of moral support. In her youth, Sor Ada had experienced everything from hunting tigers in the wild to singing classic love ballads, and thus instills in Dulce María a pronounced idealism and zest for life. It is through this that Dulce María becomes a dreamer; a young girl who shares her dreams and adventures with imaginary characters: a lively lizard named Homero, symbol of emotion; the toucan Prometeo symbol of reason; and the coquettish canary Alicia Josefina, symbol of love. One day, Dulce María is reunited with her childhood sweetheart Juan Francisco, a recently graduated military cadet. This marks the beginning of a passionate love story; one which will be threatened by envy, jealousy, and blind ambition. However, with the help of Jacques Delfin, a mysterious and eccentric man who lives on a yacht off the coast of Villa del Mar, Dulce María and Juan Francisco will finally unravel the secret of her birthright and find true love.

Terry McAulay (born December 24, 1959) is a former American football official who worked in the National Football League (NFL) for the 1998 through 2017 seasons. He was the referee for seven conference championship games and three Super Bowls (XXXIX, XLIII, and XLVIII). He was the Coordinator of Football Officials for college football's Big East and subsequently the American Athletic Conference from 2008 to 2017.
Personal life
Born in Brownsville, Texas, McAulay was raised in Hammond, Louisiana. He is a graduate of Louisiana State University with a degree in computer science. Beginning in 1982, McAulay was a software programmer for the National Security Agency. He retired in 2008.
Officiating career
Early years
McAulay's football officiating career began in 1976, including many years at the high school level in Howard County, Maryland. Prior to joining the NFL, McAulay was a referee in the Atlantic Coast Conference from 1994 to 1997, and was the referee for the BCS National Championship Game at the Miami Orange Bowl, in 1998.
NFL career
McAulay began his NFL officiating career in 1998 as a side judge on Walt Coleman's crew and worked the 2000 NFC Championship game, which was his last game at that position before he became a referee for the 2001 NFL season. He wore uniform number 77 (now worn by Terry Killens). Coincidentally, McAulay wore the same number and originally worked at the same position that was vacated by Mike Pereira, who served as the NFL's Vice President of Officiating from 2001 until February 2010.
He was the first referee to work a Super Bowl with fewer than five seasons experience as a referee when he was the crew chief for Super Bowl XXXIX, which came at the end of his fourth season as a referee and is one of only six NFL Referees to have worked three or more Super Bowls. McAulay worked 17 playoff games during his NFL career, including 8 conference championship games, Super Bowl XXXIX, Super Bowl XLIII & Super Bowl XLVIII. At the time of his retirement, he was considered one of the top referees in the NFL.
McAulay refereed the 2017 Monday Night Football season opener between the Los Angeles Chargers and Denver Broncos, which was the Chargers' first game since relocating to Los Angeles. When the Chargers called a first quarter timeout, McAulay mistakenly called them "San Diego".
"Bottlegate" incident
McAulay was the referee in the Jacksonville Jaguars' 15–10 victory over the Cleveland Browns at Cleveland Browns Stadium on December 16, 2001, which ended with a display of unruly fan behavior. The Browns wide receiver Quincy Morgan caught a pass for a first down on 4th and 1 as they were driving toward the end zone looking for the winning score. The Browns then ran another play, which would normally prevent the completed pass from being reviewed. Despite this, citing a "malfunction of the replay system", McAulay reviewed the catch and determined that Morgan never had control of the ball. The pass was called incomplete and the Jaguars were awarded the ball. However, fans in the "Dawg Pound" began throwing plastic beer bottles and other objects at players and officials. McAulay then declared the game over and sent the teams to the locker rooms. NFL Commissioner Paul Tagliabue called the game supervisor to override McAulay's decision to end the game prematurely, sending the players back onto the field after a thirty-minute delay, where the Jaguars ran out the last seconds under a hail of debris.
Retirement
For the 2017 NFL season, McAulay's final season with the NFL, his officiating crew consisted of umpire Steve Woods, down judge Jerry Bergman, line judge Carl Johnson, field judge Michael Banks, side judge Jonah Monroe, and back judge Rich Martinez.
On June 21, 2018, McAulay retired from the league to become a rules analyst for NBC Sports' NBC Sunday Night Football and Notre Dame football. His referee position was taken by umpire Shawn Smith.

Bobby Lee Bradford (born July 19, 1934) is an American jazz trumpeter, cornetist, bandleader, and composer. In addition to his solo work, Bradford is noted for his work with John Carter, Vinny Golia and Ornette Coleman. In October 2009, Bradford became the second recipient of the Festival of New Trumpet Music's Award of Recognition. He taught at Pomona College for 44 years.
Biography
Bobby Lee Bradford's life began in Mississippi; he and his family then moved to Dallas, Texas, in 1946. He moved to Los Angeles, California, in 1953 where he reunited with Ornette Coleman, whom he had previously known in Texas. Bradford subsequently joined Coleman's ensemble, but was drafted into the U.S. Air Force and replaced by Don Cherry.
After playing in military bands from late 1954 to late 1958, he rejoined Coleman's quartet from 1961 to 1963, which infrequently performed in public, but was indeed recorded under Coleman's Atlantic contract. These tapes were among those many destroyed in the Great Atlantic Vault Fire. Freddie Hubbard acted as Bradford's replacement upon his departure to return to the West Coast and pursue further studies. Bradford soon began a long-running and relatively well-documented association with the clarinetist John Carter, a pairing that brought both increased exposure at international festivals (though the records remain scantily available, when one excludes web rips and bootlegs). Following Carter's death in 1991, Bradford fronted his own ensemble known as The Mo'tet, with which he has continued to perform since. He is the father of drummer Dennis Bradford and jazz vocalist Carmen Bradford.
He holds a B.M. degree from Huston–Tillotson College (now Huston–Tillotson University) in Austin, Texas.
In addition to Coleman, Bradford has performed with Eric Dolphy, Leon "Ndugu" Chancler, Ingebrigt Håker-Flaten, Bob Stewart, Charlie Haden, George Lewis (trombone), James Newton, Frode Gjerstad, Vinny Golia, Paal Nilssen-Love, and David Murray, who was previously a student of his in the 1970s.
He was a lecturer at Pomona College in Claremont, California, where he taught the history of jazz and led the school's jazz ensemble. After 44 years at the college, he retired in June 2021.

The women's featherweight (52 kg/114.4 lbs) K-1 category at the W.A.K.O. World Championships 2007 in Belgrade was the lightest of the female K-1 tournaments. There were seven women from two continents (Europe and Africa) taking part in the competition. Each of the matches was three rounds of two minutes each and were fought under K-1 rules.
As there was one too few competitors for an eight-person tournament, one woman had a bye through to the semi finals. The gold medal match was won by Rajaa Hajdaowi from Morocco who defeated Russia's Yulia El Skaya in the final. Defeated semi finalists Hungarian Eva Ott and Serbian Natasa Ninic made do with bronze medals.

WXZY-LP (101.7 FM) is a community focused non-profit radio station in Kane, Pennsylvania, licensed by the FCC as a low-power FM (LPFM) and operating as a full-service station with a freeform format. Local coverage includes local events, news, and sports. The station also broadcasts a wide variety of music, with specialty programming every weekend. Weather forecasts are provided by WJET-TV.
History
This station received its original construction permit from the Federal Communications Commission on January 15, 2014. The new station was assigned the WXZY-LP call sign by the FCC on January 29, 2014. The station received its license to cover from the FCC on August 14, 2014.
WXZY-LP marks the return of FCC-licensed, locally originated radio to Kane after two previous commercial stations no longer broadcast there. AM 960 WQLE (the former WKZA), the first station in Kane, ceased broadcasting in 1992, while what is now WCOP (the former WLMI) moved to another town in the early 2010s. From its inception in 2014 until 2018, WXZY operated out of WLMI's former studios at 97 Fraley Street in Kane. In 2018, WXZY purchased the radio tower directly behind the studio and erected a new building at its base, that would serve as their new studio. Public broadcaster WPSX and religious broadcaster Family Life Network (the latter of which owns WCOP) both have repeaters in the borough that do not originate any programs from Kane.

Baby furniture refers to furniture created for babies. It is often used to help the parents of the baby keep it safe and comfortable in the home. Before baby furniture, parents would sleep with their children in their own beds, which could be dangerous for the child. Eventually, infant beds started to be built with the child's safety in mind; the intention was to keep the baby from rolling off the bed, so mangers and bassinets were created. Over time, more furniture was created with the infant's safety in mind, and there are several types and functionalities of these. Typical pieces include an infant bed (such as a crib, bassinet, or cradle), changing table, high chair, playpen, baby walker, and toy chest. Products, features, and costs vary between countries and have changed over time. Safety is of paramount importance.
Safety Procedures for Changing Tables
Many authorities state that the best way to prevent a child from falling from a changing table is to modify the table. This includes guardrails that are at least two inches on all sides, concave changing surfaces, and safety straps. Authorities also recommend keeping all necessary supplies within arms reach and to inspect the changing table before placing the child on the table. It is also important for parents to utilize safe procedures, such as proper lifting technique and using height-appropriate changing tables.
Safety Procedures for Strollers
Strollers (also known as push chairs or buggies) are a mean of transportation for infants up to around the age of 3 or 4. Variants of strollers include twin strollers as well as triple strollers. Strollers come typically with multiple functionalities including an umbrella like roof to prevent a large amount of sun to enter the stroller, the ability to detach the seat and become a car seat, the ability to fold for ease of transportation by car, and more than new designs and features are being created.

During the 1996–97 English football season, Wrexham F.C. competed in the Football League Second Division.
Season summary
In the 1996–97 season, Wrexham set off on another amazing run in the FA Cup and beating more top flight opposition. Following wins at Colwyn Bay and Scunthorpe United, they were drawn to play West Ham United at home, the game ending in a 1–1 draw on a snow-covered pitch after a well earned draw. The replay at Upton Park ended in a shock 1–0 win to Wrexham as Kevin Russell scored in the dying minutes to send Wrexham into the fourth round. After also beating Peterborough United and Birmingham City in the following rounds, they played Chesterfield in an all-Division-2 FA Cup quarter final, Wrexham narrowly losing to the Spireites 1–0.
The league campaign began very brightly for Wrexham as they lost only one from their first 17 league matches and were in the play-off places heading to Christmas but then a little decline in form with only seven wins in the second half of the campaign wasn't enough for a play-off position and finished 4 points off the top six.

Alan Kurdi, named after the drowned Syrian child of Kurdish origin, Aylan Kurdi, is a ship which has been used since 2018 by the humanitarian organization Sea-Eye - under the German flag - for the rescue of migrants in the Mediterranean Sea. Before this, she was an oceanographic vessel operated by the Land of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, named Professor Albrecht Penck.
Historical
The ship was built in 1951 at the Sachsenberg-Werke shipyard. She was launched on 4 June 1951 and completed in September 1951. The ship was part of a construction program for the Soviet Union's war indemnity requirements. The ship remained in the GDR, becoming their first research vessel.
Originally put into service as a hydrographic vessel under the name Joh L. Krueger (after mathematician Johann Heinrich Louis Krüger), the vessel was owned by the Seydrographische Dienst der DDR (SHD). On January 1, 1960, the Institute of Oceanography, where Joh L. Krueger was based, was replaced by the German Academy of Sciences at Berlin. With this change, the ship was renamed Professor Albrecht Penck (after the second director of the Institute and Museum of Oceanography in Berlin).
The GDR used the ship for research trips in the North and Baltic Seas. In 1962, the first East German Spitsbergen expedition took place, with Professor Albrecht Penck, then in 1964 she was used for the first GDR expedition to the Atlantic.
After German reunification, the ship was demobilized by the dissolution of the Academy of Sciences of the GDR, which belonged to the state of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern. In 1992, the Leibniz Institute for Baltic Sea Research in Warnemünde was established. The ship, which spent around 200 days a year at sea, was now mainly used in the western Baltic Sea. She was equipped with a research winch and had four laboratories (wet, chemical, biotechnological and IT).
On August 21, 2010, the vessel was decommissioned. The plan was to bring her to Stralsund and leave her at the Nautineum Stralsund museum for use. The state of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern deviated from this plan and offered the ship for sale, believing that funding for the use of the museum was not secure. She was then acquired through a tendering process by the Krebs Group, which agreed in March 2011 to cooperate with the Stralsund Ozeaneum for the use of the vessel. Subsequently, the ship was to be used in winter for "maritime education courses" and "research trips for student classes". She would also be used as a working platform for offshore wind turbine maintenance teams. The Krebs Group, which bought the vessel in 2011, used her for work on offshore wind farms and for environmental monitoring.
Acquisition by the humanitarian organization Sea-Eye
In autumn 2018, the ship was sold to the non-governmental organization Sea-Eye, which uses her as a rescue boat for refugees and migrants in distress in the Mediterranean Sea.
On 21 December 2018, she left the port of Algeciras for Libya. According to Sea-Eye, she was the first ship of a civilian relief organization to fly the German flag. On Sunday 10 February 2019, the father of the young Alan Kurdi named the ship in the presence of religious and political representatives, such as the Bishop of Mallorca Sebastià Taltavull i Anglada, in the port of Palma, on behalf of his drowned son.
On 3 April 2019, the Alan Kurdi rescued 64 people from a dinghy off the Libyan coast after Libyan authorities responded to radio messages. Italian Interior Minister Matteo Salvini refused to disembark the population on the pretext that the ship was flying the German flag. Activists rejected the request to travel to Germany. Due to lack of food and clean water for the three to four-week trip, the refugees were brought to Malta after an agreement was reached on 13 April from where they were distributed to Germany, France, Portugal, Luxembourg and the United Kingdom.
At the beginning of July 2019, shortly after the start of a conflict between the rescue vessel Sea-Watch 3 and the Italian authorities, the crew decided to approach the search and rescue area located off the Libyan coast, with a Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung journalist on board. On 5 July 2019, 65 people were brought aboard the Alan Kurdi off the Libyan coast, from an inflatable boat. They came from twelve different countries, 48 from Somalia, 6 from Sudan, the others from Libya, Cameroon, South Sudan, Mali, Nigeria, Benin, Benin, Ivory Coast and Guinea-Bissau. Without a GPS-enabled phone or other navigation aid, there was apparently only ten litres of potable water left on the dinghy, which had already been at sea for 12 hours. Alan Kurdi's attempts to contact Libyan authorities as well as Italian rescue command centers were unsuccessful, according to Sea-Eye. The ship headed for Lampedusa and awaited in international waters off the Italian coast. After the Italian Ministry of the Interior had sent instructions, the vessel was refused entry to the port of Lampedusa. Alan Kurdi headed for Malta. With entry into the port of the island initially prohibited, the crew nevertheless hoped to obtain clearance to moor, in line with international aid commitments. On 7 July 2019, the ship was cleared to hand over all migrants to Maltese ships after the crew reported three medical emergencies on board.
Shortly after the ship left the waters off Malta on 8 July 2019, the crew recovered 44 people traveling on a wooden boat. They came from Libya, Syria, Palestine and Pakistan. Again, the crew had to hand the migrants over to the Maltese Coast Guard. The crew then decided to initially end their operations in the Mediterranean. Despite that, on 4 August 2019 she disembarked 40 migrants in Malta.
On April 6, 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, she rescued 150 migrants and headed for the Italian coast for them to be transferred to another boat which was quarantined with the support of the Red Cross.
Change of ownership, 2021
In 2021, Sea-Eye acquired another ship, the Sea-Eye 4. The organisation then passed on the smaller Alan Kurdi, to the Spanish organisation Proem-Aid. In May 2021, the vessel had been released from detention in Olbia and was reported to be headed for Burriana for scheduled maintenance.
In July 2021, the Italian humanitarian NGO, 'RESQ (people saving people)' announced that they had acquired and were preparing to start operating the Alan Kurdi, now renamed RESQ PEOPLE. Sea-Eye had sold the Alan Kurdi for 400,000 Euros; during their time operating the boat, Sea-Eye claimed it had saved 927 lives.
As RESQ PEOPLE
After an extensive overhaul, RESQ PEOPLE sailed from the port of Burriana on 7 August 2021 to start a first rescue mission. On the first mission the team rescued initially 85 people, and subsequently 81 more before docking at Syracuse with 166 refugees aboard. On 15 October, at the end of their second mission, they disembarked 58 rescued persons at Pozzallo.

The 2009 Quadrennial Fire Review (QFR) is a publication that examines the future of wildfire in the United States and provides insight and predictions about potential changes in mission, roles and responsibilities. It was called the fire community's "crystal ball," by Tom Harbour, Director of Fire and Aviation Management for the USDA Forest Service.
The QFR is not a policy or decision document, nor does it contain specific recommendations. Its purpose is to stimulate thought and discussion within the wildfire community about how the nation can best prepare for future wildfire seasons. According to the International Association of Fire Chiefs (IAFC), the QFR "was designed as a strategic evaluative process that develops an internal assessment of capabilities of current programs and resources in comparison to future needs for fire management."
The QFR is published every four years. The first QFR was completed in 2005 and the second published in January 2009 by the National Interagency Fire Center in Boise, Idaho; and the National Advanced Fire Research Institute in Tucson, Arizona. It is modeled on the Department of Defense's Quadrennial Defense Review.
The 2009 QFR was developed by fire experts from federal, state local and tribal organizations, plus assistance from non-governmental organizations and the research and academic communities. The overall effort was coordinated through the Brookings Institution. The QFR is not reviewed or approved by any government entity. It is meant to be an independent and objective document, free from political or agency influence. The QFR's projections of future conditions extend to a 10-to-20 year time frame, while the strategies for how to prepare for those future conditions is defined in a four-to-five-year period.
The QFR looks at trends and makes forecasts about what will need to change within the fire community to deal with future challenges. Among the notable forecasts in the 2009 QFR are:
Climate change will produce longer fire seasons, with the potential of burning in the United States by the year 2014. Also, wildfire will affect more geographic regions than in the past, specifically the Northeast and Great Lakes areas, which generally have been considered at low-risk. Alaska's fire vulnerability will increase, as well, as warmer temperatures dry out vegetation.
The current drought cycle might last another 25 years, creating more stress on vegetation and contributing to a higher number of fires and more volatile fire behavior.
Growth will slow in populated areas prone to wildfire (often called the "wildland-urban interface" or WUI), but they will still be at high risk from wildfires.
Fire agency budgets will be strained by increasing demands, rising costs and falling government revenues.
The concept of "protecting all communities at all costs" should transition to "fostering self-reliance and increasing resiliency." The education focus should shift toward more self-reliance and accountability, producing "fire-adapted communities."
Social networking will become the most effective means of informing and educating the public about fire, as traditional media and informational techniques continue to decline in popularity.
The 2009 QFR also outlines an integrated fuels management plan that would help ensure that fuels treatment investments are tied more closely to land stewardship objectives. It also suggests that small-scale fuels treatments (prescribed burning, mechanical removal of brush, thinning, chemical treatments, and so forth) are not as effective as larger, landscape-scale treatments in terms of ecosystem health.
The 2005 QFR was prescient. For example, it predicted a significant increase in the number and costs of wildfires, dramatic changes in weather, accelerated WUI growth, and continued fuel build-ups. All of these forecasts proved correct.
More than 100 people participated in developing the 2009 version of the QFR. The next QFR is scheduled for publication in 2012. Electronic copies of the QFR are available at the NIFC website,

In 1818, after his son Cornelius left Columbia College, Cornelius became his partner in importing hardware, and at Cornelius' insistence, the focus of the business changed from hardware to plate glass.
On February 28, 1835, due to the fact that he was a native or resident of what is now the City or State of New York prior to the year 1785, his son James was elected a member of the Saint Nicholas Society of the City of New York, upon its inception. His son served as president of the Society in 1862 and 1864.

On March 8, 1793, he married Maria Helen Van Schaak (1773–1845), the daughter of Cornelius Van Schaack Jr. (1734–1797), and the niece of Peter van Schaack (1747–1832). Her paternal grandparents were Cornelius Van Schaack (1705–1776) and Lydia Van Dyck (1704–1785). Her great-grandmother, Lydia's mother, was Maria Schuyler (1666–1742), of the prominent Schuyler family, who was the daughter of Catharina Verplanck (1639–1690) and David Pieterse Schuyler (1636–1690), who died in 1690 as a result of the Schenectady massacre of 1690, and the niece of Philip Pieterse Schuyler (1628–1683), an early Dutch-American settler. Together, they had two surviving sons and one surviving daughter:
Cornelius Van Schaack Roosevelt (1794–1871), a businessman and real estate investor. In 1821, married Margaret Barnhill (1799–1861), a daughter of Robert Craig Barnhill.
James John Roosevelt (1795–1875), who served as a United States Congressman from New York from 1841 until 1843. In 1831, he married Cornelia Van Ness (1810–1876), the daughter of Cornelius Van Ness (1782–1852) and the niece of William P. Van Ness and John Peter Van Ness.
Catherine Angelica Roosevelt (1803-1844).
On August 13, 1840, Roosevelt died. Upon his death, he bequeathed a large fortune to his children, making his son Cornelius one of the five richest men in New York City.
Descendants
Roosevelt's great-grandchildren include Theodore Roosevelt (1858–1919), the future President of the United States, John Ellis Roosevelt (1853–1939), William Emlen Roosevelt (1857–1930), and Granville Roland Fortescue (1875–1952), an author and soldier.

Background
The track is essentially a track which disses Ja Rule. Examples of disses from Dr. Dre in the track are: "This little nigga, Ja Rule, talking bout he's gonna slap me, nigga please, you gotta jump and swing up to hit me at the knees." At the end of the song, Obie spoke over the beat telling Ja Rule to, "Go behind all the gangsta's you want. Matter of fact get every gangsta from every hood in the United States of America to back you. Aint nobody reppin' with you, you cant see that?" This was intended to mock Ja Rule's street credibility, declaring that no one was backing him again and that he "fell off."

In the traditions of Samoa, Losi was a giant and a son of Tagaloa, who instructed him to go and catch fish for the gods. Losi obeyed, but played a trick on the gods by laying a fish at the door of each of them, causing them to slip and fall. Losi then stole a slip of taro plant and smuggled it back to earth, where it became a staple of Samoan diet.

Dr Archibald Campbell Clark FFPSG (1852–1901) was a nineteenth-century Scottish physician who made major advances in mental health care philosophies.
Life
He was born at Tarbert, Loch Fyne, the son of Donald Clark, a merchant, and his wife Margaret Campbell. His father died when he was young and they then moved to Lochgilphead. He was educated there at the Free Church School. From around 1867 he assisted at the local asylum, where he learnt an empathy for the patients.
He worked for some years as a warehouseman in Glasgow then studied medicine at Edinburgh University graduating from MB ChB in 1878 and gaining his doctorate (MD) in 1886.
He was assistant medical officer at the Melrose Asylum in the Scottish Borders before joining the Edinburgh Asylum under Dr Thomas Clouston.
Around 1890 he became Medical Superintendent of the Glasgow District Asylum at Bothwell. In 1895 he was appointed Chief Medical Superintendent of the newly completed asylum - Hartwood Hospital, serving Lanark. With over 2500 patients it was later the largest asylum in Europe.
Controversially by today's standards (but acceptable at the time) he employed electroconvulsive therapy and was the first person in Scotland to perform a lobotomy in attempts to control behaviour. He was the first to advocate professional training of all staff, and had a strong reputation for improving the actual conditions of the inmates.
He lectured at St Mungo's College in Glasgow and was president of the Caledonian Medical Society.
He died of influenza on 28 November 1901 at his house in Hartwood Village near the hospital. He was buried in the hospital cemetery in Hartwood.
Hartwood closed in 1995 following the rolling out of care in the community.
Recognition
He is remembered on the Pinel Memorial (1926) at the Royal Edinburgh Hospital.
Family
He was twice married and had two sons and one daughter.

Madhu Shalini is an Indian actress and model who predominantly works in Telugu films, in addition to Hindi and Tamil language films. She won the title of Miss Andhra Pradesh in 2005. She hosted a television show Premakathalu after winning Dream Girl contest.
Early life
Madhu Shalini was born in Hyderabad, India. Her father Hameed is a businessman and mother Polapragada Raj Kumari is an advocate and a classical dancer. Like her mother, she also learned Kuchipudi, before taking part in a beauty contest, which she won and which paved her way for a modelling career.
Career
After working as a television anchor for a short while, she soon ventured into film business, turning an actress.
She made her feature film debut with the film, E. V. V. Satyanarayana's Kithakithalu, opposite Allari Naresh, released in 2006, which went on to become a very successful venture. The same year, she had appeared in two more Telugu films, namely Teja's Oka V Chitram as part of an ensemble cast, and Aganthakudu. In 2007, she starred in the Telugu action comedy State Rowdy, a remake of the successful Tamil K. S. Ravikumar-directorial Aethiree, with Madhu Shalini playing a Brahmin girl character, played by Kanika in the original. She made her Tamil film debut later that year with the low-budget feature Pazhaniappa Kalloori.
She later signed to play the lead female in D. Sabhapathy's Telugu project Happy Journey, while she also agreed to appear in the director's next Tamil venture, Pathinaaru, which, despite being heavily delayed, became her next release. Though the film received mixed reviews and fared averagely at the box office, Madhu Shalini's performance as Indhu received positive reviews, with critics citing that she performed her role "with consummate ease", was "adequate in her role", and acted "like a pro". Her subsequent release, Karalu Miriyalu, likewise, released to negative reviews, while her performance, however, met with favorable remarks from critics, with one reviewer claiming that she "looks pretty and dishes out a pleasing work", further noting that it was a pity that she does not get to work in any "big projects". She eventually got her big break as she was cast by noted National Film Award-winning filmmaker Bala for his comedy flick Avan Ivan. She disclosed that Bala selected her without even auditioning her, after numerous girls were auditioned for the role, with none of them measuring up to Bala's expectations. Madhu Shalini would play a college student in the film, for which she did not apply any makeup, while also dubbing for herself for the first time.
She made her Bollywood debut in Ram Gopal Varma's Department, that featured her as a gangster alongside Amitabh Bachchan, Sanjay Dutt and Rana Daggubati. She collaborated with Ram Gopal Varma again later that year on the horror flick Bhoot Returns and two years later on the psychological thriller Anukshanam. Madhu Shalini will be seen as a reporter in Gopala Gopala. Lastly, she was seen in the Tamil movie Thoongavanam as Esther, a nurse and as Seetha in Seethavalokanam.

Pleshcheyovo Ozero (Lake) National Park (Russian: Национальный парк «Плещеево озеро») covers Lake Pleshcheyevo and surrounding areas in the Zalesye part of the Yaroslavl Oblast. The lake is highly popular for recreational use, as an ecological habitat, and is a former resort for the Russian tsars. The lake is located on the central part of the East European Plain, about 130 km northeast of Moscow, in the basin of the Upper Volga. On the southeast shore is the old town of Pereslavl-Zalessky, included in the Golden Ring of Russia.
Topography
The lake itself is 9 km in diameter, and has a 28 km shoreline. It is 25 meters in depth but shallow around the edges. The surrounding shore and region is shaped by the receded glaciers of the last ice age, leaving a moraine-type landscape: gravelly formations of long ridges, extensive wetlands and meandering rivers, and occasional isolated hills. The higher ground above the lake has river valleys with terraces, and the middle region wetlands include peat bogs and other wetlands, including the Berendeyevskoye swamp (5007 hectares). The southern area of the park reached
Ecoregion and climate
The ecoregion of Pleshcheyovo is Sarmatic mixed forests (WWF ID #436). This ecoregion is a strip of low forests, lakes and wetlands, running from the Baltic Sea east to the Urals. Forest cover is typically mixed conifer and deciduous trees, with large unbroken tracts under pressure from agriculture. For aquatic habitat, the park is in the "Volga-Ural" freshwater ecoregion (WWF ID #410), a region that is characterized in general by a high number of fish species but relatively few endemics. Of the 65 species of fish in the overall ecoregion, 19 are found in Lake Pleshcheyevo. The development of dams, reservoirs and catchments along the Volga have disrupted spawning sites and favored species adapted to slower moving waters.
The climate of Pleshcheyovo is Humid continental climate, warm summer (Köppen climate classification (Dfb)). This climate is characterized by large swings in temperature, both diurnally and seasonally, with mild summers and cold, snowy winters. Average temperatures range from 10 F in January to 64 F in July. Annual precipitation averages 23 inches. Annual snowcover is 13–140 cm, and typical depth is 30–40 cm. Soil in mid-winter freezes to a depth of 1 meter.
Plants
The territory is partially forested, with stands of artificially-introduced Scots Pine (130–150 years ago) along the shore. There are also spruce and aspen forest areas, and some mixed broadleaf with oak trees at their northern limit. The park has recorded 790 species of vascular plants in 93 different families.
Animals
The park has recorded 300 species of vertebrates, including 60 species of mammals, 210 of birds, 10 of reptiles and amphibians, 109 of insects, and 19 of fish. A large-sized vendance (Russian: "Ryapushka"), a freshwater whitefish of the Salmonidae, is endemic to Lake Pleshcheyevo; some authors describe it as a subspecies Coregonus albus Pereslavicus. While endemic, the Ryapushki is not threatened, and served in smoked form as a local delicacy. The health of the Ryapushka has been historically a measure of the health of the lake, as records have been kept of catches and deliveries to the royal court since 1645, through the limiting of large-scale commercial capture in the early 1960s. The Ryapuska was the subject of one of the Russian government's first public acts concerning conservation, when a ban on catching small whitefish was imposed in 1668.
History
The lake region has been inhabited for millennia, and shows the long interplay of natural and human forces. The ancient city of Pereslavl has a wide variety of historical, cultural, and natural sites. The city draws hundreds of thousands of visitors every year to see its historic buildings and sites.
Tourism
Pereslavl is a popular tourist destination from Moscow - it is a 2-3 bus ride between the two cities, and the buses run every. Hotels can fill quickly during holidays and peak periods.

FIFA 22 is a football simulation video game published by Electronic Arts. It is the 29th installment in the FIFA series, and was released worldwide on 1 October 2021 for Microsoft Windows, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One and Xbox Series X/S. Players who pre-ordered the ultimate edition, however, received four days of early access and were able to play the game from 27 September.
Kylian Mbappé is the cover athlete for the second consecutive year.
In response to the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, EA removed Russian national teams from all versions (since 1.22 patch) of its football video games, and made Russian and Belarusian players ineligible for FIFA 22.
Features
HyperMotion Technology
FIFA 22 introduces "HyperMotion Technology,” which uses motion capture data collected from 22 real-life players playing a complete, high-intensity football match in motion capture suits. The data collected from player movements, tackles, aerial duels and on-ball actions is used to power FIFA 22 gameplay. According to an EA Sports press release, FIFA 22 uses this data in its machine learning algorithm which uses over “8.7 million frames of advanced match capture” to generate life-like player movements and animations on and off the ball in real time. This "HyperMotion" feature is only available on the 9th Generation and Stadia versions of the game, and has given rise to the slogan "Powered By Football."
Career mode
A single player “career mode” is featured in FIFA 22, where the user can play as a player or manager throughout a 15-year career. FIFA 22 introduces a create-a-club option in manager career, allowing players to design a new club with customized kits, crest, and home stadium. Career mode introduces a level feature where users can advance their player by collecting experience points that unlock player skills and “perks” to improve stats.
Ultimate Team
FIFA 22 Ultimate Team is a game mode where users can create a team and play online or offline games to earn various cards like “FUT Heroes” to add to their team. FIFA 22 Ultimate Team introduced "FUT Heroes" cards that represent different players with special ratings and attributes. The full heroes card list includes: Mario Gómez, Tim Cahill, Diego Milito, Jorge Campos, Fernando Morientes, Sami Al-Jaber, Robbie Keane, Abedi Pelé, Lars Ricken, Ole Gunnar Solskjær, Antonio Di Natale, Iván Córdoba, Freddie Ljungberg, Jürgen Kohler, Jerzy Dudek, Aleksandr Mostovoi, Joe Cole and David Ginola.

In order to keep the users of the game entertained, promotions of the cards of the players are applied. These promotions are made when there are important events worldwide such as Christmas or Halloween. However, there are also promotions regarding events in the FIFA community such as the UEFA Champions League, UEFA Europa League or UEFA Conference League. Two of the most important promotions in the video game season are the team of the year (TOTY) where the best 12 players of the year are celebrated and the team of the season (TOTS) where the best players of the most advanced leagues are celebrated. important in the world. All of these promotions include improvements to player statistics, from physical attributes to sports attributes such as skill moves stars.
As in FIFA 21, notable former players are given "icon" cards, similar to "FUT Heroes". New players added for FIFA 22 include Iker Casillas, Robin van Persie, Wayne Rooney and Cafu. Players have the option to preview Silver and Gold player packs as in the previous game, by allowing players to preview what they would receive from a pack before deciding whether to purchase it. "Icon" cards are classified as extremely rare, the probability of getting one from a player pack is below 1%.
VOLTA Football
New VOLTA mechanics in FIFA 22 will allow players to trigger special abilities during a match that would boost a player's avatar in a specific attribute. There will be three Signature Abilities available: Power Strike, Pure Pace and Aggressive Tackle. Players of FIFA 22 will also have the opportunity to play with up to three players in various online mini game modes, which will be part of the new VOLTA Arcade.
Pro Clubs
Pro Clubs is a game mode where players are able to create their own virtual character, to take part in 11v11 online matches. Players can play with up to 10 other friends in an online match where each player controls their own virtual characters on the pitch. Players can also adjust the physical stature of their avatars, which has an effect on in-game abilities. A taller avatar, for example, would generally have a lower running speed than a shorter avatar. Pro Clubs avatars also improve over time as they play more games and perform well in matches. Players also have the ability to change a variety of features about their team, such as the team's crest, kits, and the stadium appearance.
Player Traits
Traits are qualities a player possesses that affect their behaviors in-game. Each trait has a specific function that relies on how the player is controlled, either by the user or computer. Traits are divided into four different categories: Standard traits, CPU AI traits, Career Mode traits, and VOLTA Football traits. The Standard traits influence the user's and CPU's control over the player, these traits consist of different kinds of shots, throw-ins, passing skills, dribbling skills, and player health. CPU AI traits offer similar skills compared to the Standard traits however, only influence the player when the computer controls them. Career Mode and VOLTA Football traits only impact the player in their respective game modes.
Licenses
The game features more than 30 officially licensed leagues, more than 700 clubs, and more than 17,000 players. For the first time, the Indian Super League and its eleven teams were added, as well as the UEFA Europa Conference League, the third tier of European club football established in 2021. New stadiums added in the game include the Estádio da Luz, home of S.L. Benfica, the Estádio do Dragão home of FC Porto, and the Nuevo Mirandilla, home of Cádiz CF. Additionally, in January 2022 via an update, the Brentford Community Stadium, home of Brentford, was added to the game, thus ensuring all 20 Premier League teams have their respective stadiums.
Juventus, Roma, Atalanta and Lazio are not featured in FIFA 22 due to licensing issues, and are instead known as Piemonte Calcio, Roma FC, Bergamo Calcio and Latium respectively. The game retains the players' likenesses, but the official badge, kits and stadiums are replaced with custom designs and generic stadiums created by EA Sports. Bayern Munich and Barcelona are also featured in the game with licensed players and kits, but do not have their stadium licenses and thus play in generic stadiums.
Following a November 2020 announcement by Canadian actor Ryan Reynolds and American actor Rob McElhenney, through the RR McReynolds Company LLC, that they would be taking over the club, Wrexham A.F.C. were included as part of the "Rest of World" section, becoming the first non-league team to be featured in the series. Wrexham's last appearance in the FIFA series was in FIFA 08, when they were relegated from League 2 to the National League.
Removals
In February 2022, EA Sports announced that the teams from the Russian Premier League and the Russia national football team will be removed from FIFA 22, FIFA Online and FIFA Mobile amidst the country's invasion of Ukraine. The announcement comes following the FIFA and the UEFA bans on Russian teams from competitions of both FIFA and UEFA on March 1, 2022. This came just weeks after EA removed Mason Greenwood from the game in light of sexual abuse allegations against the Manchester United forward (the player did not appear in any match since his arrest). In March 2022, EA suspended Diego Maradona from FIFA 22 following a legal dispute which claimed EA had negotiated with the wrong party and therefore did not have the rights to use his likeness.
Commentators
The English-language version of the game features two new commentators. Stewart Robson replaces Lee Dixon as co-commentator to Derek Rae, while Alex Scott replaces Alan McInally in the role of providing in-game score updates in Career Mode. Scott is a former Arsenal women's team player before retiring in 2018 when she became a pundit on Sky Sports and Match of the Day. Robson has made 150 appearances for Arsenal during his playing career before he retired to join Arsenal's media team and work as a commentator for various media outlets.

Television presenter and singer Yūka Kageyama was appointed ambassador for the Japanese market.
Reception
Sales
77% percent of FIFA 22 sales were digital downloads during the first week after its release, which is a significant jump from 62% for last year's installment in the franchise, FIFA 21. As of December 2021, EA stated that over 9 million copies of FIFA 22 were sold worldwide, with more than 460 million matches played. Data analytics firm, GFK, stated that FIFA 22 was the top-selling game in 17 out of 19 European nations covered within their research, with Mario Kart 8 Deluxe following closely behind.
Awards
Reviews
FIFA 22 received "generally favorable" reviews for the PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and PC versions of the game, according to review aggregator Metacritic. The Nintendo Switch version, however, was widely panned by critics due to being largely unchanged from its predecessor, FIFA 21 (which itself was largely unchanged from FIFA 20 and FIFA 19). In a review of the game by Bleacher Report, FIFA 22 was said to be the franchise's best release in years with its HyperMotion feature. Some of those improvements include players reacting to impacts from strong passes and more agile players being noticeably more flexible and swift. Moreover, the popular video game review website, IGN, states that FIFA 22 takes advantage of the graphical power of new generation consoles with deeper and more immersive visual effects. IGN also stated that the FIFA 22 soundtrack was one of the most comprehensive playlists in recent years.
Criticism
In a report from the Norwegian Consumer Council, the use of loot box mechanics in FIFA 22 was examined as a case study.
The report was highly critical of the system, for instance estimating that to get a Team of the Year Kylian Mbappé promo card, on average the player would have to purchase a grand
total of 847 Jumbo Rare Player Packs, spending nearly 1.7 million FIFA Points, or roughly €13,500. It also stated that if the player wanted to aim for this card without spending real life money, the player would have to play continually for over three years to earn enough points to buy the average number of packs needed.
After examining some of the mechanisms used in the game to incentivize players to make in-game purchases, the report stated that "It appears obvious that the design and mechanisms driving in-game purchases
in these games are predatory, manipulative, and exceedingly aggressive, targeting consumer vulnerabilities at every opportunity".
Professional tournaments
FIFA 22 Global Series is a series of online tournaments hosted by EA Sports. The tournaments are held exclusively on PlayStation 5 where players participate in teams of one or two for in-game rewards and cash prizes. In order to qualify for the tournament, users must compete in their respective regions for high standings in the leaderboard or compete in Global Series Opens. Global Series Opens are tournaments that host the highest ranked players in their regions with winners getting cash prizes from $3,500–$10,000.

Adam LeBor is a British author, journalist, writing coach and editorial trainer. Born in London in 1961, he worked as a foreign correspondent from 1991 for many years but is now based in London. Mostly based in Budapest, he also lived in Berlin and Paris and spent substantial amounts of time reporting from the former Yugoslavia.
He covered the collapse of Communism and the Yugoslav wars for The Independent and The Times and has worked in more than thirty countries, some of which inspired his book writing. He currently contributes to The Times, the Financial Times, where he reviews thrillers, The Critic, Monocle and several other publications. He works as an editorial trainer and writing coach at the Financial Times, Citywire and Monocle.
LeBor has written eight non-fiction books, including Hitler's Secret Bankers, which exposed Swiss complicity with the Nazis and which was shortlisted for the Orwell Prize, a biography of Slobodan Milosevic, and City of Oranges, an account of Jewish and Arab families in Jaffa, which was shortlisted for the Jewish Quarterly Prize. His books have been published in fourteen languages including Chinese, Hebrew and Japanese.
Thrillers
He has written seven novels including Dohany Street, District VIII and Kossuth Square, a trilogy featuring Balthazar Kovacs, a Gypsy detective in the Budapest police murder squad, and a trilogy of thrillers featuring Yael Azoulay, an Israeli woman who works as the secret negotiator for the United Nations Secretary General. LeBor's first novel, the Budapest Protocol was partly inspired by a US military intelligence document, Intelligence Report EW-Pa 128, dated 27 November 1944, datelined London, which was declassified by the US National Archives in 1996. The document, known as the Red House Report, also featured in LeBor's non-fiction work, Hitler's Secret Bankers. The Red House Report is based on information supplied by an agent of French intelligence, who attended a meeting of Nazi officials and German industrialists at the Maison Rouge (Red House) hotel in Strasbourg on 10 August 1944. The report, a copy of which is included in The Budapest Protocol, outlines the industrialists' plans for the post-war resurrection of Germany. While some have questioned the document's authenticity, it includes the date of declassification, 6 May 1996, and the authorisation code: NND765055. National Archives and Records Administration archivist Tom McAnear identified the series (NND 765055) noting that it refers to over 2,000 boxes and declared that without more information in the way of a citation there is no way to easily locate this document or verify authenticity.
Non-fiction works
LeBor's first non-fiction book, A Heart Turned East, published in 1997, examined the lives of Muslim minorities in Europe and the United States. His other non-fiction titles include:
Hitler's Secret Bankers, first published in 1997 updated in 1999 and again in 2020, exposed Swiss economic and political complicity with Nazi Germany and was shortlisted for the Orwell Prize.
Seduced By Hitler, published in 2000, co-authored with Roger Boyes, examined daily life under the Third Reich.
Milosevic: A Biography, published in 2002, recounted the life of the former Serbian President.
City of Oranges: Arabs and Jews in Jaffa, published in 2006, portrayed the lives of Arab and Jewish families in Jaffa, Israel and was shortlisted for the Jewish Quarterly Wingate Prize. The book was re-published in 2017 by Head of Zeus, with a lengthy new afterword that updates the story of the featured families and Jaffa. LeBor co-wrote and presented Jaffa Stories, a documentary for the BBC based on this book.
Complicity with Evil: The United Nations in the Age of Modern Genocide, published in 2006, investigated the failure of the United Nations to stop genocide in Bosnia, Rwanda and Darfur, especially focusing on the role of U.N. officials.
The Believers: How America fell for Bernard Madoff's $65 billion Investment Scam, published in 2009, examined the psychology of the Madoff fraud.
LeBor's most recent non-fiction book, Tower of Basel: The Shadowy History of the Secret Bank that Runs the World, published in 2013, is the first investigative history of the Bank for International Settlements.

Tan Sri Abdullah bin Ahmad (4 July 1937 – 12 June 2016) was a Malaysian journalist and politician from the United Malays National Organisation (UMNO). Alumni of Sultan Ismail College, Kota Bharu, Kelantan and at one time, he was the editor-in-chief of the New Straits Times.
He coined the concept of a "social contract" which justified his party's government bestowing special treatments and rights towards Malaysia's dominant Malay population despite given without any constitutional backing as claimed, during a speech in Singapore in 1989.
On 12 November 2003, he wrote an article criticising Saudi Arabian policies that aided the United States invasion of Iraq, among other things. As a result, the Saudi government reduced Malaysian quota for haj. On 21 November of the same year, he "was fired without warning by the daily's management at the request of the ruling UMNO party following a complaint by the Saudi ambassador in Malaysia." UMNO, which is part of the ruling government and holding equity in the papers later stated that he had jeopardised Malaysia's close relationship with Saudi Arabia. He had a contract that was supposed to expire in October 2004.
Ahmad died on 12 June 2016, after battling cancer. He was 79. His body was brought back to his hometown in , Kelantan.

St Clement Danes School is a mixed academy school in Chorleywood, Hertfordshire.
Admissions
St Clement Danes is a partially selective school, providing education to students aged 11 (Year 7) through to 18 (Year 13). Most students are admitted based on proximity to the school, with priority given to students with siblings already at the school, or whose parents are staff at the school, but up to 10% of the Year 7 cohort are admitted based on performance in the eleven-plus exam, and a further 10% may be admitted based on performance in a musical aptitude test. Entry to the sixth form in Year 12 is dependent on GCSE exam grades, and admissions are mainly from students already at the school, but there is also an additional intake of external students.
Location
The school occupies a large site to the northwest of Rickmansworth in Chorleywood. It is about a mile (1.6 km) from Chorleywood station, and is served by buses from the station and Watford. It is situated on Chenies Road (A404), which at that point occupies the boundary of Hertfordshire and Buckinghamshire for a half-mile, adjacent to the north side of the school. The school is less than a mile west of junction 18 of the M25.
History
The school was founded in 1862 by the church wardens of St Clement Danes Parish in Aldwych, London and opened in Houghton Street. It was funded from income from the St Clement Danes Holborn Estate, a charity founded in 1551 which owned a piece of land on the north side of Holborn.
Grammar school (Holborn & Hammersmith)
The first St Clement Danes Holborn Estate Grammar School for Boys was established in 1862 in Houghton Street Holborn, near to the church.
In 1928, the school transferred to a new site on Du Cane Road in Hammersmith, where it flourished as St. Clement Danes Grammar School until 1975. The school had a well-known choir which featured in a 1975 EMI recording (ASD 3117) of Carl Orff's Carmina Burana, conducted by André Previn with the LSO (and chorus). The site was next to Hammersmith Hospital, and is now occupied by St Clement's House, a block of flats and Wood Lane High School.
On 29 June 1973, 13-year-old Nicholas St Clair from Fulham was killed on the school playing fields when he was struck in the chest by a javelin thrown by a fellow student. A verdict of accidental death was recorded by the coroner following an inquest into the incident.
Comprehensive (Chorleywood)
In 1975, under an agreement between the Governing Board of the School and Hertfordshire County Council, it was re-established in new premises in Chorleywood, as a Voluntary-Aided Mixed Comprehensive School. In April 1994 the school was incorporated as a grant-maintained school. The Du Cane Road buildings were taken over by Burlington Danes Church of England School, sold to Hammersmith Hospital in 2002 and demolished in 2004.
The school receives additional financial support from the St Clement Danes School Charitable Foundation, one of the beneficiaries of the historic St Clement Danes Holborn Estate.
Academy (Chorleywood)
The school converted to academy status in July 2011. In 2016, the school became part of the Danes Educational Trust, a multiple-academy trust, which also includes Croxley Danes School, Chancellor's School, Elstree Screen Arts academy and Onslow St Audrey's School.
Houses
The house system was introduced in 1907 with four houses: Clare, Temple, Clement and Dane. By 1938 the school had grown and two new houses were added: Burleigh and Lincoln. Essex and Exeter were subsequently introduced in 1952. On the move to Hertfordshire, the school reverted to six houses, with Clare and Essex not being reintroduced until 2005.
Current Houses and Colours
Commemoration
Every year a commemoration service is held in St Clement Danes Church in London to commemorate the beginning of the school. It is a large celebration, in which the orchestra and choir play a big part. Half of the school visit the church in London, whilst the other half attend a service held at the school in Chorleywood. The school's song 'The Anchor Is Our Emblem' is sung at the church.

In enzymology, a neoxanthin synthase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction:
violaxanthin neoxanthin
Hence, this enzyme has one substrate, violaxanthin, and one product, neoxanthin.
This enzyme belongs to the family of isomerases, specifically a class of other intramolecular oxidoreductases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is violaxanthin---neoxanthin isomerase (epoxide-opening). This enzyme is also called NSY. This enzyme participates in carotenoid biosynthesis - general.

Thomas Timothy Holden (born March 5, 1957) is an American politician from Pennsylvania who served as a Democratic member of the U.S. representative for from 1993 to 2013. Holden was the dean of the Pennsylvania Congressional Delegation during the 112th United States Congress. On April 24, 2012, Holden was defeated in the Democratic primary in his attempt to seek re-election after the boundaries of his district were redrawn. He is now chairman of the Pennsylvania Liquor Control Board.
Early life, education, and early career
Holden is a lifelong resident of St. Clair, near Pottsville. He graduated from St. Clair Area High School in 1975. In 1980, he earned a bachelor's degree in sociology from Bloomsburg University of Pennsylvania. He became a licensed real estate agent, and later an insurance broker in 1983. He has worked as a probation officer and as Sergeant-at-Arms for the Pennsylvania House of Representatives, and was the sheriff of Schuylkill County from 1985 to 1993. He identified with many ordinary working people in his district. He is a Roman Catholic.
U.S. House of Representatives
Elections
In the 1990s, he represented Pennsylvania's 6th congressional district based in Reading and including Berks and Schuylkill counties. The district was populated mostly by Reagan Democrats who were still willing to vote Republican in most elections (it voted for George H. W. Bush in 1992, Bob Dole in 1996 and George W. Bush in 2000), but Holden was re-elected four times without serious opposition.
1992
After redistricting, incumbent Democratic U.S. Congressman Gus Yatron decided to retire. In the Democratic primary, Holden defeated the Mayor of Reading, Pennsylvania, Warren Haggerty, and John Reusing 39%-32%-28%. In the general election, he defeated Republican nominee John E. Jones III, a local government solicitor, 52%-48%.
1994
Holden won re-election to a second term by defeating Republican nominee Fred Levering 57%-43%.
1996
Holden won re-election to a third term by defeating Republican nominee Christian Leinbach, a staffer to U.S. Senator Rick Santorum, 59%-41%.
1998
Holden won re-election to a fourth term by defeating Republican nominee John Meckley 61%-39%.
2000
Holden won re-election to a fifth term by defeating Republican nominee Thomas Kopel 66%-34%.
2002
Pennsylvania lost two districts after the 2000 United States Census. The Republican-controlled General Assembly dismantled the 6th, splitting its territory among three other districts. The legislature considered placing Holden's home in Schuylkill County in the 11th District, a heavily Democratic area in northeastern Pennsylvania. This would have forced a primary matchup with Paul Kanjorski, an eight-term Democrat who was slightly more liberal than Holden. Eventually, it moved the largest slice of Holden's old district, including his home, to the Republican-leaning Harrisburg-based 17th District, represented by 10-term Republican George Gekas.
On paper, the redrawn 17th appeared to so heavily favor Gekas that it appeared unwinnable for a Democrat, even one as conservative as Holden. To some, it was blatant gerrymandering to force Holden into retirement. Gekas retained 60% of his former territory, and George W. Bush had carried the newly drawn district with 57% of the vote in 2000. However, to the surprise of many observers, Holden did not retire, instead opting to run in a district that was 65% new to him (a small corner from the even more Republican 9th District was moved to the 17th). Gekas was forced into his first real campaign ever. Holden managed to gain endorsements from much of Gekas' old base, much to Gekas' surprise. Even Gekas' hometown paper, The Patriot-News, endorsed Holden, saying that the 17th was not the same district that elected Gekas in 1982. Gekas got another rude surprise when Holden visited African American neighborhoods such as Uptown and Allison Hill after finding out that Gekas had never set foot in these neighborhoods in his congressional career. He asked the residents of these neighborhoods not to vote for a congressman who didn't bother to visit them. In November 2002, in one of the biggest upsets in recent political history, Holden narrowly defeated Gekas.
2004
Holden ran for re-election against Republican lawyer Scott Paterno, son of legendary Penn State football coach Joe Paterno. Paterno was actively supported by influential Republicans, and President Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney came to the district several times to support him. Nevertheless, Holden won re-election by a comfortable margin even as Bush easily carried the district. In much of the district, he was the only elected Democrat above the county level.
2006
Holden faced Republican Matthew Wertz, an Afghanistan War veteran, in the 2006. However, Wertz dropped out of the race before the general election citing personal reasons and Holden went on to easily win re-election with 65% of the total vote.
2008
In 2008, he faced Republican Toni Gilhooley, a retired Pennsylvania State Trooper and 25-year veteran of the force, whom he defeated with 64% of the vote (one percent less than the previous election).
2010
Holden was challenged by Republican nominee, State Senator Dave Argall, whose state senate district covered much of the eastern portion of the congressional district, including Holden's home. Unlike other Democrats in Eastern Pennsylvania like Paul Kanjorski, Chris Carney and Patrick Murphy, Holden won re-election, and did so with a 12-point margin, defeating Argall 56% to 44%.
Before Holden won the general election, he faced a primary challenge within his own party from political activist Sheila Dow Ford, who ran to the left of Holden, eviscerating the Congressman for voting against the Affordable Care Act in March 2010. Holden defeated Ford by a margin of 65% to 35% in the primary to regain the Democratic nomination.
2012
Holden's district was drastically reconfigured as a result of legislative redistricting done in the Pennsylvania legislature in late 2011 following the results of the 2010 Census. The district lost Harrisburg and Lebanon, along with its shares of portions of Berks, Dauphin, Lebanon and Perry counties. To make up for the loss in population, the legislature pushed the district well to the north and east, adding Scranton, Wilkes-Barre, Pittston, and Easton, among other various towns in Luzerne, Lackawanna, Carbon, Monroe and Northampton counties. Holden now found himself running in territory that he did not know and that did not know him. The only county retained from his old district was his home county, Schuylkill County. As a result of these changes, the 17th was now considerably more Democratic than its predecessor, nearing 60 percent Democratic registration and leaving Holden vulnerable to a challenge to his left in the Democratic primary. Also, the League of Conservation Voters put Tim Holden on their "Dirty Dozen" list, targeting him for supporting then-President George W. Bush's energy policy, favoring oil production, and opposing President Obama's policies including development of clean energy.
In the April 24 primary, Holden was defeated by Moosic attorney Matt Cartwright, a considerably more liberal Democrat. Holden's opposition to the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and climate change legislation are believed to have contributed to his defeat. He also could not overcome the demographics of the redrawn district, which was almost 80 percent new to him.
Tenure
Holden was a member of the Blue Dog Coalition.<ref name="Issues">Issues , Tim Holden for U.S. Congress</ref> He was a somewhat conservative Democrat who often bucked his party's voting trend, especially on social issues. For instance, he opposed abortion and gun control. However, he supported Democratic priorities on a number of issues. While Holden voted with a minority of House Democrats in favor of the authorization for the use of U.S. force in Iraq in October 2002 for President George W. Bush, he strongly opposed Bush's "surge" policy in January 2007. While Holden voted against the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, the signature legislative domestic policy achievement of President Barack Obama, in March 2010, he did vote for the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, signed into law by Obama, in February 2009. While Holden voted for legislation supported by President Bush that toughened bankruptcy laws and enacted the Halliburton loophole, he voted for the Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, signed into law by President Obama, in July 2010. According to opencongreess.com, Holden has voted with the Democratic leadership in Congress 73 percent of the time in recent years. He is ranked as one of the top fifteen most conservative Democrats in the House by the National Journal.
In 2011, Rep. Holden became a co-sponsor of Bill H.R.3261 otherwise known as the Stop Online Piracy Act. Holden withdrew his co-sponsorship of SOPA on January 18, 2012.

The Macintosh Color Classic (sold as the Macintosh Colour Classic in PAL regions and Macintosh Color Deluxe in Japan) is a personal computer designed, manufactured and sold by Apple Computer, Inc. from February 1993 to May 1995 (up to January 1998 in PAL markets). It has an "all-in-one PC" design, with a small, integrated 10″ Sony Trinitron display at 512 × 384 pixel resolution. The display is capable of supporting up to thousands of colors with a video memory upgrade.
The Color Classic is the final model of the original "compact" family of Macintosh computers, and was replaced by the larger-display Macintosh LC 500 series and Power Macintosh 5200 LC.
Hardware
The Color Classic has a Motorola 68030 CPU running at 16 MHz and has a logic board similar to the Macintosh LC II.
Like the Macintosh SE and SE/30 before it, the Color Classic has a single expansion slot: an LC-type Processor Direct Slot (PDS), incompatible with the SE slots. This was primarily intended for the Apple IIe Card (the primary reason for the Color Classic's switchable 560 × 384 display, essentially quadruple the IIe's 280 × 192 High-Resolution graphics), which was offered with education models of the LCs. The card allowed the LCs to emulate an Apple IIe. The combination of the low-cost color Macintosh and Apple IIe compatibility was intended to encourage the education market's transition from Apple II models to Macintoshes. Other cards, such as CPU accelerators, Ethernet and video cards were also made available for the Color Classic's Processor Direct Slot.
The Color Classic shipped with the Apple Keyboard known as an Apple Keyboard II (M0487) which featured a soft power switch on the keyboard itself. The mouse supplied was the Apple Mouse known as the Apple Desktop Bus Mouse II (M2706).
A slightly updated model, the Color Classic II, featuring the Macintosh LC 550 logic board with a 33 MHz processor, was released in Japan, Canada and some international markets in 1993, sometimes as the Performa 275. Both versions of the Color Classic have 256 KB of onboard VRAM, expandable to 512 KB by plugging a 256 KB VRAM SIMM into the onboard 68-pin VRAM slot.
The name "Color Classic" was not printed directly on the front panel, but on a separate plastic insert. This enabled the alternative spelling "Colour Classic" and "Colour Classic II" to be used in appropriate markets.
Upgrades
Powered by a Motorola 68030 processor, the Color Classic can only go up to Mac OS 7.6.1. However, some Color Classic users upgraded their machines with motherboards from Performa/LC 575 units ("Mystic" upgrade), while others have put entire Performa/LC/Quadra 630 or successor innards into them ("Takky" upgrade). Another common modification to this unit was to change the display to allow 640 × 480 resolution, which was a common requirement for many programs (especially games) to run.
With the Mystic mod, the Color Classic uses the motherboard of the Macintosh LC 575 which has a Motorola 68LC040 CPU (at a speed of 33 MHz instead of 25 MHz) and is pin compatible with the Color Classic. A Color Classic with the Mystic upgrade can go up to Mac OS 8.1 (Mac OS 8.6 and newer require PowerPC processors).
With the Takky mod, the case and connector need to be modded, but doing so will allow the use of a PowerPC 601, 603, or 604 equipped motherboards. A Color Classic with the Takky upgrade can go up to Mac OS 9.1 (Mac OS 9.2 and newer require a G3 processor). On Takky Color Classics, there is a way to upgrade the processor with a G3 CPU, but it will only go up to Mac OS 9.2.2 as Mac OS X isn't officially supported.

Marerere Mwarpayo wa Mwachai is a Kenyan politician and was the Member of Parliament (MP) for Msambweni Constituency from 1997 to 2002. She also served as the assistant minister for Gender, Culture and Social Services. She lost the 1992 elections for Msambweni Constituency to Kassim Mwamzandi. She also lost the 2002 elections to Abdalla Ngozi. Mwachai worked as a school teacher before venturing into politics.
Controversy
In November 1999, Mwachai was ordered by court to pay Jones Munyaga Ksh. 58,000 for attacking him while he was on duty. Munyaga claimed he blocked Mwachai from entering into St. Augustine's Preparatory School on a Sunday evening. Mwachai's daughter was a student at the school and Munyaga worked as a night guard. The school's rules did not allow visitation on Sundays. When he blocked her, Mwachai told her security detail to cuff him up and forced her way into the school.
In June 2017, Mwachai was accused by her adopted son, Shaahidin Rajab, for abandoning him. Mwachai adopted Rajab from Mama Fatuma Goodwill Children's Home in Eastleigh, Nairobi. He, however, says that he was overworked in the Mwachai household and was always the first suspect whenever household items went amiss. Mwachai, however, accused him of having been a trouble child who has had several run ins with the law. Mwachai said that despite having schooled him at Msambweni Primary School from class one to eight, Rajab was constantly arguing with her first born daughter and stealing things from the house.
Legacy
Mwachai was the first woman in the Coast region to be elected to parliament.
In 2002 after then president Daniel arap Moi announced that Uhuru Kenyatta would be the KANU presidential candidate, many prominent KANU members ditched the party. Mwachai was one of the few who stayed put and backed Uhuru for the presidency.
As of July 2017, she is running for MP Msambweni Constituency on a New Vision Party ticket. She is also the secretary general of the party.

Douglas is a strongly Republican county. Apart from a narrow plurality of thirty-two votes to Bill Clinton in 1992, it has voted Republican in every Presidential election since 1968, and in all but five overall since 1880. Despite its long-time Republican leanings, Hillary Clinton's 2016 performance of gaining a mere 23.8 percent of the county's vote stands over six percent worse than any Democrat since the Civil War.

In operations research and social choice, the proportional-fair (PF) rule is a rule saying that, among all possible alternatives, one should pick an alternative that cannot be improved, where "improvement" is measured by the sum of relative improvements possible for each individual agent. It aims to provide a compromise between the utilitarian rule - which emphasizes overall system efficiency, and the egalitarian rule - which emphasizes individual fairness.
The rule was first presented in the context of rate control in communication networks. However, it is a general social choice rule and can also be used, for example, in resource allocation.
Definition
Let be a set of possible `states of the world' or `alternatives'. Society wishes to choose a single state from . For example, in a single-winner election, may represent the set of candidates; in a resource allocation setting, may represent all possible allocations of the resource.
Let be a finite set, representing a collection of individuals. For each , let be a utility function, describing the amount of happiness an individual i derives from each possible state.
A social choice rule is a mechanism which uses the data to select some element(s) from which are `best' for society. The question of what 'best' means is the basic question of social choice theory. The proportional-fair rule selects an element such that, for every other state :Note that the term inside the sum, , represents the relative gain of agent i when switching from x to y. The PF rule prefers a state x over a state y, if and only if If the sum of relative gains when switching from x to y is not positive.
Comparison to other rules
The utilitarian rule selects an element that maximizes the sum of individual utilities, that is, for every other state :That rule ignores the current utility of the individuals. In particular, it might select a state in which the utilities of some individuals is zero, if the utilities of some other individuals is sufficiently large.
The egalitarian rule selects an element that maximizes the smallest individual utilities, that is, for every other state :This rule ignores the total efficiency of the system. In particular, it might select a state in which the utilities of most individuals are very low, just to make the smallest utility slightly larger.
The proportional-fair rule aims to balance between these two extremes. On one hand, it considers a sum of utilities rather than just the smaller utility; on the other hand, inside the sum, it gives more weight to agents whose current utility is smaller. In particular, if the utility of some individual in x is 0, and there is another state y in which his utility is larger than 0, then the PF rule would prefer state y, as the relative improvement of individual y is infinite (it is divided by 0).
Properties
When the utility sets are convex, a proportional-fair solution always exists. Moreover, it maximizes the product of utilities (also known as the Nash welfare).
When the utility sets are not convex, a proportional-fair solution is not guaranteed to exist. However, when it exists, it still maximizes the product of utilities.
The PF rule in specific settings
Proportional fairness has been studied in various settings.

Fantastica Mania 2014 was a series of five professional wrestling events co-produced by Japanese promotion New Japan Pro-Wrestling (NJPW) and Mexican promotion Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre (CMLL) taking place between January 15 and 19, 2014. 2014 was the fourth year in which NJPW and CMLL come together to produce Fantastica Mania events, but the first time they held five events in one year, compared to two events in 2011 and 2012 and three in 2013. 2014 also marked the first time Fantasticamania events were held outside of Tokyo's Korakuen Hall, with the January 14 taking place in Osaka, Osaka at the Bodymaker Colosseum, the January 15 event in Kyoto, Kyoto at the KBS Hall and the January 17 event in Tokyo's Shin-Kiba 1st Ring, while the January 18 and 19 events were still held in Korakuen Hall. 2014 marked the first time some of the Fantastica Mania events were broadcast on pay-per-view (PPV).
Background
The events featured five to seven professional wrestling matches on each event with different wrestlers involved in pre-existing scripted feuds or storylines. Wrestlers portray either villains (referred to as heels in general or rudos in Mexico) or fan favorites (faces or técnicos in Mexico) as they compete in wrestling matches with pre-determined outcomes.
Following the success of Fantastica Mania 2013, then New Japan Pro-Wrestling (NJPW) president Naoki Sugabayashi announced that in 2014 he would like to take the event outside of Tokyo, naming Osaka and Nagoya as possible candidates. Fantastica Mania 2014 was officially announced on October 25, 2013, during the first day of NJPW's "Road to Power Struggle" tour, with events scheduled to take place in Osaka, Kyoto and Tokyo. On October 31, NJPW announced that the January 17 Shin-Kiba 1st Ring event would feature only CMLL luchadores, which would have made it the first Fantastica Mania event to not feature any NJPW wrestlers. NJPW wrestlers Taichi and Taka Michinoku were, however, later announced for the event. On November 7, NJPW announced the sixteen CMLL wrestlers taking part in the tour. A promotional poster released for the tour advertised NJPW wrestlers Bushi, Hiroshi Tanahashi, Jyushin Thunder Liger and Shinsuke Nakamura as taking part in the tour. The cards for all five events were released on January 6, 2014. On January 10, NJPW announced that the January 14 and 18 events would be broadcast live on pay-per-view (PPV) in Japan and internationally on internet pay-per-view (iPPV) through Niconico and Ustream, making them the first Fantastica Mania events available on PPV. On January 16, the tour ending January 19 event was also announced as a PPV.

Liquore Galliano L'Autentico, known more commonly as Galliano (), is a sweet herbal liqueur produced in Italy. It was created in 1896 by Tuscan distiller and brandy producer Arturo Vaccari and named after Giuseppe Galliano, an Italian officer of the Royal Italian Army of the First Italo-Ethiopian War.
Galliano is sweet with vanilla-anise flavour and subtle citrus and woodsy herbal undernotes. The vanilla top note differentiates Galliano from other anise-flavoured liqueurs such as anisette, ouzo, sambuca, and pastis.
Galliano is used both as a digestif and as an ingredient for cocktails, notably the Harvey Wallbanger, Yellow Bird, Golden Cadillac, and Golden Dream.
Ingredients
Galliano has numerous natural ingredients including star anise, Mediterranean anise, juniper berry, musk yarrow, lavender, peppermint, cinnamon, and Galliano's hallmark vanilla flavour. Galliano uses vanillin for flavouring and sugar and glucose syrup for sweetening. Caramel and tartrazine are used to achieve Galliano's bright yellow colour.
Neutral alcohol is infused with the pressings from the herbs except for the vanilla. The liquid is distilled and then infused with separately pressed vanilla. In the final stage, distilled water, refined sugar and pure neutral alcohol are blended with the base. The original blend is formulated at 84.6 proof (42.3% by volume), while a blend with a more prominent taste of vanilla is produced at 60 proof (30% by volume). There was also a period where 80 proof (40% alcohol by volume) was produced.
Brand ownership
The Galliano brand is currently owned by Dutch distiller Lucas Bols, and marketed through its worldwide distribution joint venture, Maxxium. Galliano is packaged in a distinctively shaped bottle, reminiscent of a classical Roman column.
Several other liqueurs are also produced under the Galliano brand name, including a black Sambuca, a white Sambuca and an amaretto, which are predominantly distributed in Australasia, where the products are popular as shots.

Evolve or Be Extinct is the eighth studio album by English grime artist Wiley. The album was released on 19 January 2012 as a double-disc album. Two singles were released from the album, "Link Up" and "Boom Blast". The album entered the UK Albums Chart at number 97 on 22 January 2012, then climbed up to number 86 in the UK Charts in its second week. Upon discussing the album, Wiley said: "I came to a point in my life where I realized that [I had] to actually evolve and I was just trying to put myself to the test, and make a real album that I would make. I used to do things and not finish them. This time around I actually did concentration from the start. If something wasn't right, I went back and I said, 'Wiley, this isn't right.' Not to say on the other [albums] I didn't work hard, but it's just that this time I actually did concentrate, and it's probably the first time I ever have."
Critical reception
Upon release, Evolve Or Be Extinct has received fairly positive feedback from the public and critics. Ash Houghton of SB.TV rounded up his review with: "All in all, Evolve Or Be Extinct is another strong piece of work from one of the most prolific, multi-talented artists the UK has to offer. Wiley consistently provides a body of work which encompasses his input on all levels, from production to vocals; his name is strewn throughout the album's credits which, in turn, ensures nothing but the purest sound grime has to offer." Noel Gardner of BBC gave a satisfying review, saying: "A haphazard, sometimes ridiculous, but often impressively inventive new set. In fact, this feels like an album by, for and about himself. Most lyrics unapologetically address the life of Wiley; two baffling skits, in which he quarrels with a taxi driver and customs officer respectively, seem to play up to his hothead reputation. Evolve or Be Extinct will appeal largely to people already well aware of it, and who are looking for a full-length to rival his 2004 debut Treddin' on Thin Ice. This should go some way to satisfying them." Riky Bains of RWD Magazine gave Evolve of Be Extinct a positive review stating: "Wiley is moving in a new direction and throwing new sounds and innovative ideas at a tough audience; just like Charles Darwin. His work wasn't fully accepted or appreciated till a decade later. Is this album ahead of its time?"

James Hamilton Ross (May 12, 1856 – December 14, 1932) was a Canadian politician, the third commissioner of Yukon, and an ardent defender of territorial rights. He is also considered to be the first resident of Moose Jaw, Saskatchewan.
Early life
Ross was born in 1856 to John Edgar Ross and Christina Graeme (Hathern) Ross. On January 2, 1882, Ross, a western Canadian rancher born in London, Canada West, and four other men were scouting the location for the Canadian Pacific Railway divisional point when they became the first residents of the modern-day town of Moose Jaw, Saskatchewan.
Four days later, Ross established a homestead on the site, becoming the town's first permanent resident.
Territorial political career
Soon after, Ross became an active participant in territorial government. He continuously campaigned for responsible government and was active in the negotiations to create the provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan.
Ross sat in the Legislative Assembly of the Northwest Territories between 1883 and 1901, and was Speaker from 1891 to 1894 and a member of the Executive Council between 1895 and 1897. Ross also served as treasurer and then became the Commissioner of the Yukon Territory on March 11, 1901, becoming the first Yukon Commissioner to reside in Government House in Dawson City.
Personal life and family
On August 15, 1901 his wife and youngest son, William, were lost in the sinking of the SS Islander near Juneau.
Another of his daughters, Jane Ross, married Alistair Fraser, the son of Lieutenant-Governor of Nova Scotia Duncan Cameron Fraser, who later went on to become Lieutenant-Governor in his own right.
His son, James Hamilton Ross, a chemist at McGill University, developed and patented a new method of synthesizing RDX used by the Allies in the Second World War. He was awarded the Medal of Freedom as well as Member of the Order of the British Empire.
Federal political career
Ross ran for a seat to the House of Commons of Canada in a by-election held on December 2, 1902. He became the Yukon's first Member of Parliament defeating Yukon territorial councilor Joseph Clarke. He did not visit the Yukon Territory during the campaign and incurred no election expenses other than his deposit.
Ross was appointed to the Senate in 1904. Between 1904 and 1905, Ross represented Regina, Northwest Territories and after 1905 until his death, he continued to represent Regina after the creation of the province of Saskatchewan.

Paraclete (, ) means 'advocate' or 'helper'. In Christianity, the term paraclete most commonly refers to the Holy Spirit. In Islam its meaning or Ahmad is derived from the meaning of praise, praise, or praise
Etymology
Paraclete comes from the Koine Greek word (). A combination of ('beside/alongside') and ('to call'), the word first appears in the Bible in John 14:16. René Kieffer further explains the development of the meaning of this term:
Latin etymological precedent
Lochlan Shelfer suggests that the Greek term is a translation of the preceding Latin term :
In Classical Greek
The term is not common in non-Jewish texts. The best known use is by Demosthenes:
A Greek–English Lexicon, apart from Demosthenes (above) cites also the example of a slave summoned as a help.
In Judaism
Philo speaks several times of "paraclete" advocates primarily in the sense of human intercessors.
The word later went from Hellenistic Jewish writing into rabbinic literature.
Other words are used to translate the Hebrew word 'comforter' and .
In Christianity
In the Christian New Testament, paraclete appears only in the Johannine texts, and it is used only on five occasions: John 14:16, 14:26, 15:26, 16:7, and 1 John 2:1.
In John 14:16-17, 'paraclete' is and 'spirit' is (), meaning 'breath'. appears over 250 times in the Christian New Testament, and is the word used to refer to the Holy Spirit. As a result of the immediate explanation in John 14:17, the paraclete in John 14:16 is considered to be the Holy Sprit.
The New Testament Studies, a peer-reviewed academic journal published by Cambridge University Press, describes a "striking similarity" between the defined attributes of what the Paraclete is, and is to do, and what the outcome of Christian prophecy has spoken to, explaining the paraclete as the post-Passover gift of the Holy Spirit. "The Paraclete represents the Spirit as manifested in a particular way, as a pneumatic Christian speech charisma. Every verb describing the ministry of the Paraclete is directly related to his speech function."
The early church identified the paraclete as the Holy Spirit. In first-century Jewish and Christian understanding, the presence of the Holy Spirit is to claim the rebirth of prophecy.
During his period as a hermit in the mid-12th century, Peter Abelard dedicated his chapel to the paraclete because "I had come there as a fugitive and, in the depths of my despair, was granted some comfort by the grace of God."
Today, the Holy Spirit continues to be referred to as the paraclete in a prayer known as the Divine Praises, recited during Benediction of the Blessed Sacrament.
Scholarly interpretations
John 14:16 quotes Jesus as saying "another Paraclete" will come to help his disciples, implying, according to Lawrence Lutkemeyer, that Jesus is the first and primary Paraclete. In 1 John 2:1, Jesus himself is called "paraclete".
Raymond Brown (1970), supported by George Johnston (2005), also says that the "another Paraclete" of John 14:16 is in many ways another Jesus, the presence of Jesus after Jesus ascends to his Father.
The Gospel of Matthew twice uses the passive form of the corresponding verb , in 2:18 and 5:4. In both instances, the context is of mourning, and the meaning of the verb is 'to be comforted'.
Paraclete first appearing in gospel
Here is the context of the passage in John 14:15-27 with the translation of Paraclete as Advocate emphasised:
In Islam
Many Muslim writers have argued that "another Paraclete" (John 14:16)—the first being Jesus—refers to Muhammad. This claim is based on Quran 61:6.
A few Muslim commentators, such as David Benjamin Keldani (1928), have argued the theory that the original Koine Greek used was , meaning 'famed, illustrious, or praiseworthy', rendered in Arabic as (another name of Muhammad), and that this was substituted by Christians with . There are currently no known Greek manuscripts with this reading (all extant Greek manuscripts read ), although the earliest manuscript evidence available is from the 3rd century.
Regarding what the original Greek term was, according to A. Guthrie and E. F. F. Bishop:
Sean Anthony agrees that the connection of Ahmad to the Paraclete in the Gospel of John may have been a later tradition that is not found in the work of Ibn Ishaq and that the earliest extant attempts by Muslims to connect these two figures that inspire later discussion on the subject goes back to Ibn Hisham and Ibn Qutaybah.
A later interpolation of this passage to the Quran has been rejected in modern Islamic studies. This has been supported by the fact that the earliest as well as the later manuscripts of the Quran contain the same passage and wording in Surah 61.

In Łewond's version of the correspondence between the Byzantine emperor Leo III the Isaurian and the Umayyad caliph Umar II, the following is attributed to Leo:

The was the first professional wrestling promotion to be based in Japan. It operated from 1953 to 1973.
History
JWA under Rikidōzan (1953–1963)
Rikidōzan, a former rikishi (sumo wrestling practitioner) who had debuted as a Western-style professional wrestler in 1951, decided in 1953 to establish a territory that would represent the National Wrestling Alliance in Japan.
In those early days, Japanese professional wrestlers came from out of the sumo or judo ranks; former sumotori usually used their shikona (Rikidōzan, Azumafuji, Toyonobori, etc.) while former judokas usually used their real names or modifications of them (Masahiko Kimura, Michiaki Yoshimura, etc.) Rikidōzan pushed himself as the top star of the promotion, first battling other Japanese wrestlers such as Kimura and Toshio Yamaguchi, but found a strong niche in feuds with American wrestlers such as Lou Thesz, The Destroyer and Bobo Brazil. In 1957 he defeated Thesz to win the title that would be the JWA's top title thereafter, the NWA International Heavyweight Championship. As a newly found hero to the war-weary Japanese masses, Rikidōzan expanded into several business ventures. It resulted in his murder at the hands of a gangster in 1963, at the peak of his fame.
JWA after Rikidōzan (1963–1973)
After Rikidōzan's death in 1963, the company continued to operate as the nation's premier (and only male) wrestling circuit until challenged in the late 1960s by International Wrestling Enterprise, which featured the first major World heavyweight championship based in Japan, the IWA title. The JWA's top stars, Giant Baba and Antonio Inoki left to form their own promotions (All Japan Pro Wrestling and New Japan Pro-Wrestling, respectively) in 1972. With its top drawing cards gone, the JWA was therefore out of business the following year.

Annual tournaments
World Big League
, later renamed to simply was a professional wrestling tournament annually held by Japanese Wrestling Association from 1959 till 1972. The 1973 edition was not held as JWA folded that year.
Wrestlers from all over the world participated in the various editions of the tournament, as it was meant since its beginning to be a world tournament. It had been one of the most important pro-wrestling tournament of its time, because it was one of the very few (and for some years after its creation the only) pro-wrestling tournaments of its time to be considered representative of the entire pro-wrestling world.
In 1970, JWA created a tag team counterpart of the World League, known as World Tag League.
Its prestige led Antonio Inoki and Giant Baba to create in their respective promotions, New Japan Pro-Wrestling and All Japan Pro Wrestling, tournaments which were presented as the direct followers to the JWA World League. Therefore, respectively, the G1 Climax for the NJPW and the Champion Carnival for the AJPW are the indirect descendant of the original World League.
The following is a list of the winners of each edition:
1st World Big League (1959): Rikidozan by defeating Jess Ortega.
2nd World Big League (1960): Rikidozan(2) by defeating Leo Nomellini.
3rd World Big League (1961): Rikidozan(3) by defeating Mr. X.
4th World Big League (1962): Rikidozan(4) by defeating Lou Thesz.
5th World Big League (1963): Rikidozan(5) by defeating Killer Kowalski.
6th World League (1964): Toyonobori by defeating Gene Kiniski.
7th World League (1965): Toyonobori(2) by defeating Fred Blassie.
8th World League (1966): Giant Baba by defeating Wilbur Snyder.
9th World League (1967): Giant Baba(2) by defeating The Destroyer.
10th World League (1968): Giant Baba(3) by defeating Killer Kowalski.
11th World League (1969): Antonio Inoki by defeating Chris Markoff.
12th World League (1970): Giant Baba(4) by defeating Don Leo Jonathan.
13th World League (1971): Giant Baba(5) by defeating Abdullah the Butcher.
14th World League (1972): Giant Baba(6) by defeating Gorilla Monsoon.
World Tag League
, also called World Tag League, was a professional wrestling tournament annually held by Japanese Wrestling Association from 1970 till 1972. The 1973 edition was not held as JWA folded that year. Wrestlers from all over the world participated in the various editions of the tournament, as it was meant to be a world tournament. It was created in 1970 as the tag team counterpart of World Big League.
Its prestige led Antonio Inoki and Giant Baba to create in their respective promotions, New Japan Pro-Wrestling and All Japan Pro Wrestling, tournaments which were presented as the direct followers to the JWA World Tag League. Therefore, respectively, the G1 Tag League for the NJPW and the World's Strongest Tag Determination League for the AJPW are the indirect descendant of the original World Tag League. In fact, in 2012, NJPW renamed the G1 Tag League the World Tag League.
The following is a list of the winners of each edition:
1st NWA Tag League (1970): Antonio Inoki and Kantaro Hoshino by defeating Nick Bockwinkel and John Quinn.
2nd NWA Tag League (1971): Antonio Inoki (2) and Seiji Sakaguchi by defeating Killer Kowalski and Buddy Austin.
3rd NWA Tag League (1972): Seiji Sakaguchi (2) and Akihisa Takachiho by defeating Larry Hamilton and Joe Hamilton.
Alumni

Jeffrey Leiwakabessy (born 23 February 1981) is a Dutch former professional footballer who played as a left back.
Club career
Born in Elst, Gelderland, Leiwakabessy played his first professional seasons with NEC Nijmegen. In 2006–07 he moved to Alemannia Aachen in Germany, which had just returned to the Bundesliga after a four-decade absence; during the campaign he appeared in all 34 league matches, but could not help prevent the team's immediate relegation.
After one more season in Aachen, Leiwakabessy joined Anorthosis Famagusta FC in the Cypriot First Division. He went on to feature in twelve 2008–09 UEFA Champions League games as the side overachieved in the group stage, even though it was eventually ousted as last.
On 4 January 2012, Leiwakabessy returned to his country and signed a one-year contract with VVV-Venlo in the Eredivisie. On 15 October of the following year, after a period of trial, he joined former club NEC until the end of the campaign.

Simon George Thomas (born 28 December 1963) is a Welsh former politician who was a member of Plaid Cymru. He was a Member of Parliament (MP) for Ceredigion from 2000 to 2005, and an Assembly Member in the National Assembly for Wales representing Mid and West Wales between 2011 and 2018.
He resigned as an Assembly Member and his party membership on 25 July 2018, following arrest by police on suspicion of possession of indecent images. On 3 October 2018, he pleaded guilty to three counts of making indecent images of children. On 31 October 2018 he was given a 26-week jail sentence, suspended for two years.
Early life
He went to Aberdare Boys' Grammar School (became Aberdare Boys' Comprehensive School in 1978). At the University of College Wales, Aberystwyth, he gained a BA in Welsh and Education in 1985. He gained a Postgraduate diploma (DipLib) from the College of Librarianship Wales (CLW) in Llanbadarn Fawr, Aberystwyth in 1988 (College became part of the university in 1989).
He was a assistant curator for the National Library of Wales from 1986 to 1992. From 1992 to 1994, he was Policy and Research Officer for the Taff-Ely borough council. From 1994 to 2000, he was Rural Development Manager for the JIGSO rural development agency.
Thomas is the father of two children. At the time of his trial, he lived in Penparcau, a village south of Aberystwyth. Locals have raised concern that he lives on the same street as a primary school.
Political career
Thomas was elected as a Councillor in Ceredigion County Council for Aberystwyth East in 1999 and resigned after being elected a Member of Parliament. He was fifth on Plaid Cymru's regional list for Mid and West Wales in the inaugural National Assembly for Wales election in 1999; only list leader Cynog Dafis was elected.
Thomas was first elected as MP for Ceredigion in the 2000 by-election after Dafis stepped down to focus on his role as an Assembly member. On entering the House of Commons, he took the oath of allegiance in the Welsh language, and was heckled by some English MPs. He retained the seat for Plaid Cymru at the 2001 election with a reduced majority, and lost it in the 2005 general election to Mark Williams of the Liberal Democrats. During the 2005 general election he wrote a blog on the Channel 4 News website which shows a near daily account of his campaign trail and his thoughts following his defeat. Thomas said he had not expected his defeat. According to a BBC news report he said "I was getting a very positive response on the doorstep". In the aftermath of his defeat, he called for Plaid Cymru to reform its leadership arrangements and have a single leader "round which the party coalesces and around which the people of Wales can identify".
After the 2007 Welsh Assembly election, Simon Thomas was appointed a special adviser to the Plaid Cymru ministers in the Welsh Assembly Government coalition between his party and Labour.
In September 2010, Simon Thomas was placed at the top of Plaid Cymru's regional list for Mid and West Wales in the 2011 Welsh Assembly election with the incumbent Nerys Evans instead running for the constituency seat of Carmarthen West and South Pembrokeshire. He was elected to the National Assembly for Wales.
When a party leadership election was triggered by the resignation of Ieuan Wyn Jones, Thomas announced his candidacy on 1 December 2011. The following 6 February, he withdrew in favour of Elin Jones, running to become her deputy leader. The election was won by Leanne Wood.
In the 2016 Assembly Election, he also contested the constituency of Carmarthen West and South Pembrokeshire, coming third as Angela Burns retained it for the Conservatives.
Following the 2016 election he was elected unopposed as chair of the Assembly's Finance Committee, a position he held until July 2018.
United Kingdom parliamentary expenses scandal
As part of the investigation into the United Kingdom parliamentary expenses scandal, Thomas was found to have over claimed £349.20 in mortgage interest between 2004 and 2005 under the additional costs allowance (ACA). He was recommended to repay this sum, by 1 April 2009 no money was repaid.
Arrest and resignation
On 25 July 2018 he resigned as an AM and from Plaid Cymru following his arrest by police on suspicion of possession of indecent images. His seat was taken by Helen Mary Jones, who was next in line on Plaid's regional list.
On 18 September he was charged by Dyfed-Powys Police with three counts of making indecent images of children.
He pleaded guilty to three counts of making indecent images at Aberystwyth Magistrates' Court on 3 October 2018, having made over 600 such images and videos. On 31 October 2018 he was given a 26-week jail sentence, suspended for two years by Mold Magistrates Courts and ordered to remain on the sex offenders register for seven years.

Thomas contested several elections under the Plaid Cymru banner:

Scientific analysis
In October 2020, a group of scientists, including those from the Imperial College COVID-19 Response Team, published an analysis of the all-cause mortality effect of the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic for 21 industrialised countries – including its timing, demographics and excess deaths per capita – and assessed determinants for substantial variations in death rates such as the countries' pandemic preparedness and management.
An analysis published in the Lancet in March 2022 by Wang et al. suggests up to 18 million lives may have been lost to the pandemic.

Archimedes is a liquid-fuel rocket engine burning liquid oxygen and liquid methane in an oxidizer-rich staged combustion cycle. It is designed by aerospace company Rocket Lab for its Neutron rocket.
History
Archimedes was presented on December 2, 2021 in a webcast by Rocket Lab CEO Peter Beck. It was presented as a fully reusable, gas generator engine using LOX and methane as propellant, a departure form the company's previous Rutherford, which is electrically pump fed. He then stated that it had a thrust of and 320 seconds of specific impulse. The same day, the Neutron page on Rocket Lab's website was updated specifying the thrust of the seven Archimedes used on the first stage as at sea level and a maximum thrust of and the upper stage's single vacuum optimized Archimedes at . It is expected to have its first hot-fire test during 2022.
In an interview published on CNBC website, Mr. Beck stated that Archimedes would be manufactured in New Zealand and its very simple design had "all the things you want when you have to build an engine that can be reused over and over again.”
In the September 21st, 2022 Investor Day Presentation, the engine design had changed to an oxidizer-rich staged combustion cycle. It was then stated that the sea level version would have a maximum thrust of with a vacuum isp of 329s and would be able to throttle to a 50% of maximum thrust. Meanwhile the vacuum optimized version, would have a maximum thrust of , an isp o 367s and the same throttling capabilities of 50% of maximum thrust. It was also implied, but not confirmed, that the engine would be built in the Virginia, USA factory. It was also disclosed they would use the Stennis Space Center A-3 Test stand for development testing. They expected to start preburner testing in that or following quarter, hopefully starting full engine testing at Stennis before 2023 ends, and hoped to be able to launch in 2024.
Design
Archimedes is presented as a highly reusable liquid-propellant engine using methane and liquid oxygen in a oxidizer-rich staged combustion cycle. There are both sea-level and vacuum variants. The engine is mostly 3D printed, with some of the biggest 3D printers in the world. The rationale for the cycle change from the original gas generator was that they could not get the performance they needed through all the throttle points that a reusable rocket needs, without pushing the turbine temperature and other factors beyond their preset limits. By changing to the higher performing cycle but with lower performance requirements, they we are able to lower temperatures and other stress factors and increase margins everywhere, making reusability much more attainable.

Mariana Bracetti Cuevas (also spelled Bracety) (1825–1903) was a patriot and leader of the Puerto Rico independence movement in the 1860s. She is attributed with having knitted the flag that was intended to be used as the national emblem of Puerto Rico in its attempt to overthrow the Spanish government on the island, and to establish the island as a sovereign republic. The attempted overthrow was the Grito de Lares, and Bracetti's creation became known as "The Flag of Lares." The flag's design was later adopted as the official flag of the municipality of Lares, Puerto Rico.
Early years
Bracetti, born in the city of Añasco, Puerto Rico, met and developed a romantic relationship with Miguel Rojas Luzardo, a rich Venezuelan businessman visiting Añasco. Rojas and his brother Manuel owned a coffee plantation called "El Triunfo" near Lares. Miguel and Manuel Rojas were admirers of Dr. Ramón Emeterio Betances and were influenced by his ideals of independence for and beyond Puerto Rico. Bracetti married Rojas with whom she had children.
The first independence movement flag of Puerto Rico
Bracetti then moved to the hacienda "El Triunfo", which was to become the clandestine nucleus of the revolution that would be known as El Grito de Lares. The Rojas' admiration for Betances led them to join him in the conspiracy to rebel against, and gain independence from, Spain.
The Rojas brothers became the independence leaders in Lares and their code name was Centro Bravo (Bravo Center). Manuel Rojas, Bracetti's brother-in-law, was named Commander of the Liberation Army. Mathias Brugman was the independence leader in Mayagüez and his group went by the code name of Capa Prieto (Dark Cape).
Bracetti's nickname was Brazo de Oro (Golden Arm) and she was appointed the leader of the "Lares's Revolutionary Council." Betances suggested that Bracetti knit the first flag (modeled on the Dominican Republic's flag) of the future "Republic of Puerto Rico." With the materials provided by Eduvigis Beauchamp Sterling, named Treasurer of the revolution by Betances, Bracetti designed and knitted the flag taking into consideration Betances's suggestions. The flag was divided in the middle by a white Latin cross, the two lower corners are red and the two upper corners are blue. A white star was placed in the upper left blue corner. According to Puerto Rican poet Luis Lloréns Torres the white cross on the Revolutionary Flag of Lares stands for the yearning for homeland redemption; the red squares, the blood poured by the heroes of the rebellion and the white star in the blue solitude square, stands for liberty and freedom.
El Grito de Lares
On the morning of September 23, 1868, an Army of about 800 men met in the El Triunfo plantation and Manuel Rojas proceeded to take the town of Lares, which initiated the revolution known as El Grito de Lares. Once the town was taken, Bracetti's flag was placed on the High Altar of the Parroquial Church. The revolutionists declared Puerto Rico a republic, swore in Francisco Ramírez Medina as its first president and celebrated a speedy mass.
The rebel forces then departed to take over the next town, San Sebastián del Pepino. The Spanish militia, however, surprised the group with strong resistance, causing great confusion among the armed rebels who, led by Manuel Rojas, retreated back to Lares. Upon an order from the governor, Julián Pavía, the Spanish militia soon rounded up the rebels. All of the survivors, including Bracetti, were imprisoned in Arecibo and the insurrection was quickly brought to an end. The original Lares flag was taken by a Spanish army officer as a war prize and many years later returned to the Puerto Rican people. It is now exhibited in the University of Puerto Rico's Museum. Eighty of the prisoners died in jail, Bracetti however, lived and was released on January 20, 1869, when the new Spanish Republican government granted them general amnesty. Mariana Bracetti died in the municipality of Añasco, Puerto Rico in 1903 and was buried in the Plaza of Añasco. There is a monument honoring her on the spot where she is buried.
Legacy
Juan de Mata Terreforte, a revolutionist who fought alongside Manuel Rojas in the Grito de Lares, and who was the Vice-President of Puerto Rican Revolutionary Committee, a Chapter of the Cuban Revolutionary Party in New York City, adopted Bracetti's "Flag of Lares" as the flag which represented Puerto Rico. It became their standard until 1892 when the current design, modeled after the Cuban flag, was unveiled and adopted by the committee.
Bracetti was the principal subject of two books: El Grito de Lares by Luis Lloréns Torres, and Brazo de Oro by Cesáreo Rosa-Nieves. Her memory has been honored in Puerto Rico and elsewhere with schools, streets and avenues named after her. In Lares, there is a Mariana Bracetti Museum and in Philadelphia there is a Mariana Bracetti Academy Charter School. The Mariana Bracetti Plaza and public housing development in New York City was also named after her. The public housing development built and maintained by the New York City Housing Authority in New York City's Lower East Side.

In differential geometry, the Tait–Kneser theorem states that, if a smooth plane curve has monotonic curvature, then the osculating circles of the curve are disjoint and nested within each other.
The logarithmic spiral or the pictured Archimedean spiral provide examples of curves whose curvature is monotonic for the entire curve. This monotonicity cannot happen for a simple closed curve (by the four-vertex theorem, there are at least four vertices where the curvature reaches an extreme point) but for such curves the theorem can be applied to the arcs of the curves between its vertices.
The theorem is named after Peter Tait, who published it in 1896, and Adolf Kneser, who rediscovered it and published it in 1912. Tait's proof follows simply from the properties of the evolute, the curve traced out by the centers of osculating circles.
For curves with monotone curvature, the arc length along the evolute between two centers equals the difference in radii of the corresponding circles.
This arc length must be greater than the straight-line distance between the same two centers, so the two circles have centers closer together than the difference of their radii, from which the theorem follows.
Analogous disjointness theorems can be proved for the family of Taylor polynomials of a given smooth function, and for the osculating conics to a given smooth curve.

Dancing Madly Sideways is the fourth studio album by the British-based American musician Marcella Detroit, released in July 2001.
Background
Detroit explains the title and concept of Dancing Madly Sideways as being "How I see the world; going crazy. Not progressing, not going back, just going sideways". The non-traditional electronic sound of the record stemmed from Detroit "wanting to do something more experimental". The album was released for free download through numerous MP3 websites and as a mail-order exclusive physical release from Detroit's website. It is the first Detroit album released y her independent label Banned Records, which was later renamed Lofi Records. Preceding the album's release, two releases were made available for purchase: a CD single of "Lust for Like" and a three-track sampler EP, Limited Edition.
Critical reception
Aaron Badgley from Allmusic gave the album a positive review, writing, "Here [Detroit] is able to assemble a tight band and produce a brilliant, angry, aggressive, exciting dance/rock album. Detroit's vocals are strong, as is her outstanding guitar playing. Fast, tasteful, and tuneful solos complete the mix and contribute to the originality of the music."

L'Auberge du bon repos, sold in the United States as The Inn Where No Man Rests and in Britain as The Inn of "Good Rest", is a 1903 French short silent comedy film by Georges Méliès. Set in an inn, the film addresses the state of the drunken mind with light heartedness.
Production
The Inn Where No Man Rests is an expanded version of an earlier Méliès film, The Bewitched Inn (1897). The Moon and a manic chase, as featured in the film, are both common motifs in Méliès's work. As usual for his films, the chase here is circular, within a single set; however, Méliès did eventually try the linear, multi-scene chase format of his contemporaries (such as Ferdinand Zecca and Lucien Nonguet) in his film A Desperate Crime.
Méliès himself plays the traveler in the film. The table and pendulum are animated using stage machinery; other objects are pulled or suspended using wire, and additional effects are worked using substitution splices.
The Inn Where No Man Rests was sold by Méliès's Star Film Company and is numbered
465–469 in its catalogues.

Summary
Krishna is a young boy who one day is herding cattle when a car pushes him into a river. When he throws stones at the windows that night in retaliation, he is caught. The owner, Kalegowda, makes him walk on broken glass, while his children laugh, but Krishna doesn't cry out and silently waits for revenge.
25 years later, Krishna is crowned 'Mandyada Gandu' in a cycle race. Meanwhile, Kalegowda's son Ranga tells him Krishna's father Doddegowda has died, and Kalegowda takes his land. Krishna stops Kalegowda from producing false land documents and takes the land back. While passing in a car, Krishna breaks the window of Kalegowda's daughter Radha's car and tears her clothes. Kalegowda summons all the villagers to discover who did it but Krishna never comes. Krishna meanwhile explains why he doesn't want to marry his love interest Gouri although she is in love with him. Gouri is later kidnapped by Ranga and thrown off a bridge.
Krishna stops Kalegowda from taking the villagers' crops as payment for fake loans. In retaliation, Kalegowda sends Ranga to burn Krishna's crops, but Ranga is caught. In the panchayat, Ranga is punished by Krishna in the same manner as Krishna once was, by forcing him to walk over broken glass, and Ranga cries out in pain. Angered by this, Radha comes up with a plot to defeat Krishna. At the Maaramma temple when both Radha and Krishna are present, the thali on the idol's neck appears to fall down, and the priest presents it to Krishna as prasada saying he and Radha are meant for each other. Krishna saves Radha from drowning, and Radha comes to Krishna that night and expresses her feelings for him. However, the village soon arrives with Kalegowda, and both the priest and Radha lie claiming he stole the thali and raped Radha. In the panchayat, Krishna is banished, but is soon picked up by an unknown car.
The car later picks up Kalegowda and the driver is famous director Ashok Kumar, who wants to shoot a movie in Kalegowda's house. starring a Mr. Kishan and a Mrs. Gown. Ranga soon falls in love with Gown, while Radha is drawn to Kishan. Kishan tells Ranga that Gown is willing to marry him, and after Ranga signs some papers the marriage is done. However Ranga discovers a baby with Gown, but she tells him it is for the film. Kishan takes Kalegowda and Radha to his house. Radha soon expresses her feelings for Kishan. Meanwhile, Krishna returns and reveals he was Kishan while Gouri was Gown, and Ashok Kumar tells him he wants justice done for Gouri. Krishna then goes to Radha's room and records her unknowing confession that her alleged rape was false. Krishna uses this as a bargaining chip to force Radha to reveal the truth. After leaving Kishan's house due to an urgent panchayat call, Kalegowda accepts the allegations of rape and theft against Krishna were false.
When Gown is breastfeeding the baby, Ranga demands to know whose it is. When she says it is his, he throws it off the stairs only to be caught by Krishna. It is revealed that when Ranga kidnapped Gouri, he raped her before throwing her in the river. Ashok Kumar arranged for Ranga to unknowingly marry Gouri because of the baby that resulted. The marriage is certified by the papers Ranga unknowingly signed, and Krishna reveals he was Kishan and had slept with Radha. At first Gouri and her child are abused by the rest of the family, but Gouri gives some advice to Radha on her love for Krishna. Radha returns home and faints, and Kalegowda sends her to the hospital to get an abortion. Meanwhile, Ranga seems to develop and newfound bond with his wife and child. At the hospital Radha realizes her father lied to them and reveals she wants children and rushes back.
Ranga takes Gouri and their son to his sugar mill, but soon reveals his plan to kill them both. They are saved by Krishna, who beats up Ranga's goons and fights with Ranga and Kalegowda. Krishna is about to finish Kalegowda when Gouri pleads to spare his life. Kalegowda then takes a pistol to shoot Krishna, but instead shoots Radha's arm when she leaps in front of Krishna. She pours out her love for Krishna to her father and her desire for children, and Kalegowda feels shame for his actions and asks Krishna for forgiveness, and Ranga feels shame for how he treated Gouri and his son. The movie ends with Krishna and Radha marrying and Kalegowda blessing the couple, and Ranga, Gouri and their son reconciling.

Wilkes County is a county located in the east central portion of the U.S. state of Georgia. As of the 2010 census, the population was 10,593. The county seat is the city of Washington.
Referred to as "Washington-Wilkes", the county seat and county are commonly treated as a single entity by locals, including the area's historical society and the Chamber of Commerce. It is part of the Central Savannah River Area (CSRA).
History
Wilkes County, named for British politician and supporter of American independence, John Wilkes, is considered Georgia's first county established by European Americans; it was the first of eight original counties created in the first state constitution on February 5, 1777. The other seven counties were organized from existing colonial parishes.
Wilkes was unique in being made up of land ceded in 1773 by the indigenous Creek and Cherokee Native American nations in their respective Treaties of Augusta. Its location was unique due to its close proximity to the Atlantic seaboard fall line.
Between 1790 and 1854, Wilkes County's area was reduced as it was divided to organize new counties following the growth of population in the area. The Georgia legislature formed the counties of Elbert, Oglethorpe, and Lincoln entirely from portions of Wilkes County. Wilkes also contributed part of the lands used in the creation of Madison, Warren, Taliaferro, Hart, McDuffie, and Greene Counties.
Wilkes County was the site of one of the most important battles of the American Revolutionary War to be fought in Georgia. During the Battle of Kettle Creek in 1779, the American Patriot forces were victorious over British Loyalists.
During the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, colonists depended on enslaved African-American workers and whites to clear land, develop plantations, and cultivate and process cotton in this area. Long-staple cotton would not grow in this upland areas and short-staple cotton was originally too labor-intensive to be profitable.
In 1793, American Eli Whitney perfected his revolutionary invention of the cotton gin at Mount Pleasant, a cotton plantation east of Washington. It allowed mechanization of the processing of short-staple cotton, making its cultivation profitable in the upland areas. As a result, there was a dramatic increase in the development of new cotton plantations throughout the Deep South to cultivate short-staple cotton.
Settlers increased pressure on the federal government to remove Native Americans from the region, including the Five Civilized Tribes from the Southeast. In 1794, Revolutionary War veteran Elijah Clarke, led a group of men from Wilkes County into traditionally Creek lands and established a town and several forts and called it the Trans-Oconee Republic. While short lived, the incursion was part of a broader movement of incursion into traditionally native lands. Congress passed the Indian Removal Act in 1830 and the government forcibly removed most of the members of these tribes to Indian Territory west of the Mississippi River.
Production of short-staple cotton in the Deep South soon superseded that of long-staple cotton, grown primarily on the Sea Islands and in the Low Country. Such expansion dramatically increased the demand for slave labor in the Deep South, resulting in a longstanding domestic slave trade that transported more than a million slaves in forced migrations from the Upper South. King Cotton brought great wealth to many planters in the decades before the Civil War.
None of the battles of the American Civil War was fought in or near Wilkes County. But here President Jefferson Davis met for the final time with the Confederate Cabinet, and they officially dissolved the government of the Confederate States of America. Wilkes County was the last-known location of the gold rumored to have been lost from the Confederate Treasury. The present-day Wilkes County Courthouse was built in Washington at the site of the cabinet meeting.
Geography
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (1.0%) is water. It is located in the Piedmont region above the fall line.
The northern quarter of Wilkes County, in a curved line from Rayle through Tignall to the northeastern corner of the county, is located in the Broad River sub-basin of the Savannah River basin. The eastern portion of the county, from Washington east, and bordered to the north and west by the Broad River sub-basin, is located in the Upper Savannah River sub-basin of the larger Savannah River basin. The rest of the county, south of Washington, is located in the Little River sub-basin of the Savannah River basin.

The Arrowhead Refinery Superfund site is a 10-acre former waste oil recycling facility, located in Hermantown, Minnesota, within a white cedar wetland. The refining process generated a waste stream of highly acidic, metal-laden sludge which was disposed of in an unlined two-acre lagoon on the site and waste process water which was discharged into a wastewater ditch in a wetland area. Arrowhead Refining Company incorporated in 1961 and continued the re-refining activities until 1977. A public health risk assessment stated that if no action was taken to remedy the site, use or development of the site would result in unacceptable health effects on user populations. It was also determined that there was a future potential exposure risk for offsite drinking water wells across the road from the site and in the pathway of the contaminated groundwater plume. The record of decision (ROD) was issued in September 1986.
Threats and contaminants
Site investigations that began in May 1984 found volatile organic compounds (VOCs), polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons (PNAs), carcinogenic PNAs, petroleum hydrocarbons, and metals in the source material, soils, and sediments. In addition, the pH of the sludge was found to be between one and two.
Cleanup progress
The site has been fully remediated. In 1990, 13 residents were taken off of their well water and placed on municipal water. Between 1991 and 1993, a groundwater extraction system was constructed onsite, which created a hydraulic barrier around the site, so that no off-site migration would occur. The original ROD also called for on-site incineration of soils and sludge materials. However, the ROD was amended in 1994 to the following:
The excavation and treatment of sludge was conducted in 1995 and 1996 and is complete. The excavation and off-site disposal of soils and sediments was conducted in 1996 and is complete. There has been an ongoing long-term remedial action with respect to the groundwater extraction system. The groundwater extraction system has been shut down because it appears that the groundwater cleanup goals have been met.
A five-year review report was submitted in September 1997, which showed that contaminant levels in the underlying aquifer had dropped steadily. The system will continue to operate until cleanup objectives are fully met. A second five-year review report was issued in September 2002. The five-year review concluded that the source material phase, the groundwater phase, and the soil and sediment phase are currently protective of human health and the environment. A final protectiveness statement cannot be made for the soil and sediment phase until further information is obtained, regarding potential impacts to aquatic organisms in the site ditch, soil settlement issues and a plugged culvert, and finalization of restrictive covenants.
A third five-year review completed in September 2007 determined that all of the issues from the second five-year review were addressed with the exception of the finalization of the property restrictive covenants. Restrictive covenants are one of several legal or administrative controls which help to minimize exposure to contaminants and are generally referred to as institutional controls. The third five-year review determined that the remedy is expected to be or is protective of human health and the environment, and in the interim, exposure pathways that could result in unacceptable risks are being controlled. However, in order for the remedy to be protective in the long-term, some further actions need to be taken, including more robust institutional controls to ensure the remedy is not disturbed in the future. A trial shut-down of the groundwater extraction system has been started by the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency (MPCA) and ground water monitoring will be performed for several more years to verify that groundwater cleanup goals have been achieved. Groundwater will also be monitored to determine if surface water is being impacted by the site. The MPCA and the EPA are in the process of implementing more institutional controls that will achieve long-term protectiveness at the site.
A fourth five-year was completed in August 2012. The review concluded that the site was protective of human health and the environment in the short term, and that to ensure the site is protective of human health and the environment in the long term, more robust institutional controls, such as restrictive covenants, should be placed on the site. The MPCA and the EPA are in the process of implementing these institutional controls, and will soon begin the process to delist the site from the National Priorities List.
Property reuse
The property has been purchased by a developer who is interested in using the property for commercial use.

The origins of bowling in Spain are uncertain, but legend says that over a thousand years ago, at the time of the primitive Castile, the Highlanders bet their weapons and even the horses that used to fight the Arabs in contested and passionate bowls matches. It is even said that the warring Cantabrians that inhabited the north of Spain challenged each other in bowling matches before frighten the imperial legions of Augustus.
There are many different bowls games around Spain (more than 20) but Cantabria, Castile and León, Basque Country, and Asturias, are the places where there are a greater number of variants. One of the most spectacular games are the "Bolos Tres Tablones" (bowls three boards), which is originally from Las Merindades, in the north of Spain.
The bowling alley is divided into three different areas: The launching area, pin area and "Birle" area. The bowling balls have fingered and hand-holes, are 26–28 cm in diameter and usually weight between 6 and 8 kg. There are three boards (tablones or cureñas) and three pins on each one; there is a small pin which is situated outside of the boards and is the most important one.
The game starts by throwing the bowling ball from the launching area (cas) by the air trying to bring down as many pins as possible and the small pin (mico) inclusive. The first bounce of the bowling ball must be in the board, otherwise it will be cancelled (morra) and we won't get any point. Scoring is as follows: each pin knocked down its worthone point, the medium pin exclusive worth two points, and the demolition of the small pin (mico) is worth four points, only if another pin has been knocked down.

The Diocese of Wangaratta is a diocese of the Anglican Church of Australia. It is situated in the north-eastern part of the state of Victoria, Australia. Its geographic remit includes the cities of Wangaratta, Albury-Wodonga and Shepparton. The cathedral is the church of the Holy Trinity in Wangaratta. The diocese was erected in 1902, when Thomas Henry Armstrong was installed as the first Bishop of Wangaratta. The current bishop is Clarence Bester who was enthroned in 2020.
History
The diocese was founded in 1902.
In 2019, the diocese voted in favour of a motion authorizing a blessing rite for same-sex unions. In November of 2020, the Appellate Tribunal, the church's highest court, ruled that a diocese may authorize blessing rites for same-sex unions, allowing the Wangaratta motion to go into effect.
Cathedral
The cathedral church of the diocese is Holy Trinity Cathedral, Wangaratta. The land on which the church is built was donated to the parish by William Henry Clark, a pioneer of Wangaratta. The foundation stone was laid in 1908 by Bishop Arthur Green, the Bishop of Ballarat, and was dedicated on 24 August 1909. A second section was built between 1922 and 1924. The building was faced in locally quarried granite to a design by the English architect Walter Butler. The baptistery, designed by the church architect Louis Williams, was completed in 1965.
The cathedral bells, cast in 1806, are the oldest ring of eight in Australia. The current organ was built in 1902 by Henry Willis & Sons and is the fourth instrument to be housed in the cathedral.
Deans of Holy Trinity, Wangaratta
The Rector of the Parish of the Holy Trinity, Wangaratta (the cathedral parish), is designated as Dean of Holy Trinity Cathedral.

Duel in the Jungle is a 1954 British adventure film combining the detective film with the jungle adventure genres directed by George Marshall and starring Dana Andrews, Jeanne Crain and David Farrar. It was shot at the Elstree Studios near London and on location in Southern Africa. The film's sets were designed by the art director Terence Verity. It was produced by Associated British in conjunction with Marcel Hellman. It was released in the United States by Warner Bros.
Plot
American insurance investigator Scott Walters is sent to London to interview businessman Perry Henderson about his US$2 million insurance policy leaving his elderly mother as sole beneficiary. Walters meets and is taken with Perry's personal secretary Marian Taylor but wishes to speak to Perry. His cousin Arthur Henderson explains that Perry is deep sea diving off the coast of Portuguese East Africa but doesn't tell Walters he is after deposits of diamonds on the sea bed. Alarmed by the danger, Walters tells Arthur to make Perry stop all dangerous activities or he will forfeit his policy.
Walters attempts to romance Marian, but she tells him she is engaged to Perry. He decides to return to America but boarding the plane, he sees a newspaper headline that Perry was swept overboard off the SS Nigeria during a storm when the ship was off Lourenço Marques. Walters leaves the plane and later goes to inform Marian but her landlady is cleaning her recently vacated flat saying that Marian flew off somewhere. He thinks she has gone to South Africa, so Walters flies to South Africa where he attempts to book passage on the SS Nigeria, a coastal tramp steamer. Walters finds the ship has departed, but he flies to Beira to board her there where he books accommodation sharing a compartment with Pitt, an English salesman.
During a storm Pitt and Walters are the only passengers well enough to leave their cabin to dine with the ship's captain. Keeping his occupation a secret, Walters infuriates the captain by attempting to question him about Perry's death. Walters's suspicions are further aroused when he discovers that the only witnesses to Perry's death were employees of his firm, which also owned the SS Nigeria. The next day Walters finds a secret compartment on the ship and finds a cigarette butt on the compartment's floor bearing the markings of Perry's bespoke cigarettes. Walters also discovers Marian is a passenger aboard. Marian informs the captain that she does not want Walters to bother her.
During a storm the next night, Pitt borrows Walters's trench coat to go outside. One of the crew coshes Pitt and attempts to throw him overboard but his efforts are stopped when Marian screams. Walters deduces the crewman mistook Pitt for himself and wanted him dead. When Marian goes ashore the crew attempt to keep Walters on board but he literally jumps ship and tracks Marian to Northern Rhodesia. A safari is taking her into the jungle where she supposedly is going to meet Perry's mother. With the help of a police superintendent, Walters tracks down Perry's mother.
Walters pursues Marian to discover the truth about Perry's whereabouts, with Marian being increasingly attracted to him. Walters and Marian find Perry and discover he has faked his death to get the insurance money. Perry tries to kill Walters by giving him a rifle with the firing pin removed so that a lion will kill him. Vincent, Perry's native right-hand man kills the lion further inflaming the situation. They have to flee, taking Vincent with them. They are pursued by Perry and his African helpers. The fugitives are in danger of death by water, gunshot and wild beasts (the cliche of snakes, lions and leopards) but are rescued in the nick of time by the police superintendent. Perry fights with Walters and then flees in a boat down the rapids. He capsizes and Walters saves him. Perry is arrested. The film ends with Walters and Marian embracing.

Production notes
In September 1952, the film was going to be made with Yvonne De Carlo and Joseph Cotten. In April 1953, Sam Marx was trying to set it up in London with Cotten and Gene Tierney. In May, Kurt and Marcel Hellman, producers, were discussing shooting footage of the film in South Africa later that year.
By June, the leads were confirmed as Dana Andrewas and Jeanne Crain. It was the first production from Todon, a company of Tony Owen and his wife Donna Reed. There would be five weeks filming in South Africa with the rest in London. The bulk of finance came from Moulin, a British company headed by Harold Mirisch. Associated British distributed. David Farrar signed to play the second male lead.
Although the copyright states that the screenplay was based on an original story by S. K. Kennedy, a July 1953 Variety article reports that screenwriters Samuel Marx and Tommy Morrison used a German novel originally published in 1942 as its source.
Shooting
Principal photography occurred between 24 August and early December 1953. Portions of the film were shot in South Africa at Port Elizabeth and Johannesburg, in Bechuanaland (now Botswana), and at Victoria Falls (on the Zambia/Zimbabwe border). An October 1953 Daily Variety news item stated that scenes were shot at Kruger National Park.
On 25 September 1953, British assistant director Anthony Kelly, aged 32, died when he was thrown from his overturned canoe into a whirlpool on the Zambesi River; they were near Livingstone, Zambia, towards Palm Island. He was in a boat with two hunters and an African guide. The other three got to safety but not Kelly.
The Hollywood Reporter stated that after audiences at a 29 July 1954 Los Angeles preview jeered at the film's ending, Warner Bros. re-edited the final scenes. The Variety review lists the running time of the British release as 105 minutes; reviews of the American version list the running time as 98 minutes.
Michael Mataka who sings the song "The Night Belongs to Me" became the first person of African descent to become commissioner of the Zambian Police.
Reception
According to Owen, the film made $3 million. It launched Todon on a series of films set in Africa with two American leads.
In 1954, it was expected the film would earn $2 million in the US, returning $1.2 million to Britain.

This division has the former governor who is to confide of the king's commander, namely Phraya Manrattana Rachawalop and Phraya Phichai. Alongside this, the existing Guards Artillery Regiment was reorganized in European lines as a royal guard artillery unit, and personnel of several units of the RTA, including European gunners of a number of artillery batteries, were transferred.
In 1853 Major Krom Muen Mahesuan Sivavilas was named commander of the artillery battalion of the "Tahan Lorm Wang" (Palace bodyguards) Brigade, which was raised as part of the modernization of the army. Major Phraya Siharat Dechochai was later named commander in 1854 and the unit was reorganized, its training now on European lines of the field artillery of the period. In 1907, the 1st Field Artillery Regiment, created on the basis of the artillery battalions in the Bangkok area and in a number of cities, was granted the status and dignity of a Royal Guard unit by HM King Chulalongkorn (Rama V). Disbanded in 1932, it was recreated in 1947 following the Second World War.

Even after finishing the film for a long time, no film producers came to her to make a film.

Ben is unmotivated to study and only cares about money and on the other hand, whenever Chih encounters a Chinese person, he would ask whereabouts of his childhood sweetheart. Ben and Chih's friend, Ming, is also from Hong Kong and in order to elevate his social status, he becomes involved with a bar hostess and owner Yuriko, hoping to become Yakuza leader Yamada Ishikawa's brother in-law.
In Yuriko's bar, Ben encounters Chinese student Mang Tit-lan, who is there to earn some extra money, and falls in love with her at first sight but is not favored. Tit-lan and her friend Mei-mei live with their guarantor and suffers a lot of humiliation.
Tit-lan is in love with Hideyuki Asano, who works as Yamada's top assassin, who went to South America to kill Yamada's enemy, but eventually came back to reunite with Tit-lan. However, Yamada send his men to have Asano silenced and right before he dies, he asks Tit-lan to expose Yamada to the police but Tit-lan faces the underworld's pursue to kill her.

Apocalypse 2000: Economic Breakdown and the Suicide of Democracy (also known as Apocalypse 2000: Economic Breakdown and the Suicide of Democracy, 1989-2000 or Apocalypse 2000) is a 1987 novel by English economists Peter Jay and Michael Stewart.
In the novel, trade imbalances, entrenched unemployment in Europe, pervasive inequality in the United States, and a massive default by Latin American countries creates economic and political upheaval, which Western leaders are shown incapable of addressing. A former televangelist becomes the US President in 1993 and brings in stark and disruptive economic policies. The US military withdraws from Europe and instead is redeployed to Asia to fight a civil war in the Philippines, as well as to combat drug smuggling at home.
The following year in Europe, a populist personality named Olaf D. Le Rith (an anagram of Adolf Hitler) leads his Europe First Movement (EFM) to victory in European Parliament elections. He runs on an anti-American, anti-immigration and protectionist platform, and as argued in his book Europe First, he considers European integration and a Pan-European identity as necessary to solve Europe's problems. Le Rith then forces European countries to cede sovereignty to the European Economic Community which he now controls.
Come 2000, the US has an unofficial unemployment rate in excess of 20%, and a level of violence akin to Lebanon or South Africa of the 1980s. In Europe, where the EFM rules with an iron fist, unemployment and inflation had largely been eliminated the continent, the over-centralised European economy was plagued with shortages and inefficiencies. Both the US and Europe have erected massive trade barriers, which undermines Japan's export-orientated economy and ultimately social fabric.
The novel, written in 1987, assumed the Soviet Union and East Germany would still be in existence, that apartheid in South Africa would end violently, and that India would be teetering on breaking up.
Reviewing the book in the London Review of Books, R.W. Johnson criticised some of its prognostications. The US deficit in the 1980s, while large, constituted only a tiny faction of US GNP. The authors ignored the possibilities that a deficit could be managed by currency devaluations, or that there were US interest groups with sufficient political heft to prevent a slide to protectionism.
Speculative fiction and studying the future
To label this book as a novel would be to limit its application. For while the authors don't claim it to be a prediction, there is a clear sense that they believe the underlying theme of apocalypse is a possible, even likely trajectory for the next decade or so from their writing. They did get a number of things (factors and events) generally correct, like: a young Democratic president (happened in 1992, not 1988 as stipulated); certain general social conditions (such as illiteracy rates in US); the shut down in social welfare spending; and such other items as general budgetary figures, terrorist attacks, stock market failures, Japanese society and its international political-economic juggernaut, and the rise in right-wing ethnic-cultural nationalism, to name a few. While the timing and specifics of certain events in the book (like the terrorist attack on the Waldorf-Astoria c. 1992) were off, their occurrence and effects generally occurred. Yet other significant events—like the collapse of the USSR, the rise of China, the emergence of the Digital revolution and all that meant, issues of climate change – were simply missed. The election of a tele-evangelist figure as President in 1992 is problematic because of timing and portrayal; arguably, Trump played a charismatic figure with the same policy ineptitude and incompetence as noted in the book but the timing was off.
While many of the factors and events they noted actually were approximately accurate, ultimately, the overall prognosis/forecast turned out to be very wrong for the time period covered. What were the reasons for this overall failure? Lessons from this book can point to common problems in creating scenarios and forecasts.
There are several explanations for the failures:
1. The overall narrative to this speculative futures scenario is seemingly based on the historical analogy to the rise of Nazism in the 1930s. The central charismatic figure in the book and leading the Europe First Movement into power in Europe in the 1990s was Le Rith (the anagram of Hitler). The emphasis on the driving forces of both unemployment and inflation, the questionable tactics used to eliminate opposition and being elected all match point by point to the Nazi rise to power 6o years earlier. The problem, though, is casting the narrative to fit that historical analogy, rather than allowing new elements and factors to play out independently.
2. The narrative is also driven by a certain degree of economic materialist determinism (making it somewhat Marxist in nature). Perceptions and beliefs by the masses were the result of economic conditions, reducing their concerns and hot-button issues often to economic factors. In the context of the economic tumbling occurring in the narrative where economic distress was generally real, this does make some sense, but if there is no mass economic distress, mass opinions and conflicts may reflect other non-economic factors.
3. Political decision-makers were preoccupied with several interrelated macro-economic variables: unemployment, inflation and budget/balance of payment deficits. Other policy variables were drawn in, such as tax rates, savings and interest rates, import and export levels. While the Phillips curve postulating an inverse relationship between unemployment and inflation was not mentioned, that relationship seemed to be implicit in all the deliberations and decisions. Single-minded mass concerns about employment and income security had its counterpart in reflected decision-maker attention,
4. The map of the social system they used relied on a tightly coupled set of processes with almost real-time reporting of conditions, very short lag times between notice and decision, and rapid diffusion of effects in some cases, while in others, there seemed to be little effects and/or long delays.
5. From the starting points of their analysis – c. 1985, the trajectory of conditions in the narrative seemed to diverge dramatically from the actual course of events: in the narrative, both unemployment and inflation rose and increased over the next 5–10 years, while neither of these occurred in reality. Overall, the projected collapse of Europe into a united, semi-totalitarian society under a Hitler-like figure controlling the reins of power and the collapse of the US into basically a society locked into a civil war by 2000 simply did not come anywhere close to being true. The former condition still seems at some remove while the latter seemed to be a bit closer to realization in the aftermath of Trump's defeat in 2021.
6. Policy-makers were preoccupied, even obsessed with budget and balance-of-payment deficits. That did not seem to be true. Indeed, it is arguable how much those factors actually mattered to policy-makers.
6. The narrative depended on the unique occurrence of events and/or their timing. Wild cards such as scandals, crashes (planes, markets), terrorist attacks (including assassination, kidnappings, etc.) played important roles in shaping public opinion at the times of elections and important policy legislation. Personalities were also important.
In general, the flow of the narrative towards collapse was driven by the inability of the political system to respond effectively to the twin problems of rising unemployment and inflation. The failure of the political system was but a reflection of the deeps-seated faults in the culture that prized individual consumption, me-first irresponsibility over a more prudent duty towards public well-being. The errors in the unfolding of the narrative noted above must have contributed significantly and substantially to the completely inaccurate overall conclusions of the book.

Lake Rotorua () is the second largest lake in the North Island of New Zealand by surface area, and covers 79.8 km2.
With a mean depth of only 10 metres it is considerably smaller than nearby Lake Tarawera in terms of volume of water. It is located within the Rotorua Caldera in the Bay of Plenty region.
Geography
Lake Rotorua is fed with water from a number of rivers and streams; some such as the Utuhina flow water of a water temperature warmer than the lake due to the thermal activity in the Rotorua area. Conversely streams on the northern shore such as the Hamurana Spring and the Awahou stream flow crystal clear water that has a constant temperature of 10 degrees Celsius. Other notable tributaries include the Ngongotahā stream, famous for trout fishing.
Geology
The lake was formed from the crater of a large volcano in the Taupo Volcanic Zone. Its last major eruption was about 240,000 years ago. After the eruption, the magma chamber underneath the volcano collapsed. The circular depression left behind is the Rotorua Caldera, which is the site of the lake. Several other lakes of volcanic origin are located nearby to the east, around the base of the active volcano Mount Tarawera.
Mokoia Island, close to the centre of the lake, is a rhyolite dome. It is probably New Zealand's best-known lake island, and is closely associated with one of the best-known Māori legends, that of Hinemoa and Tutanekai. Is said that Hinemoa swam across the lake to her lover Tutanekai who lived on Mokoia Island.
Owing to the geothermal activity around the lake (including still active geysers and hot mud pools), the lake has a high sulphur content. This gives the lake's waters an unusual yellowish-green hue.
Tourist attraction
Despite the large volume of water flowing through Lake Rotorua its shallow depth makes it very prone to discolouration, especially from sediment following windy weather. It is well used by fishermen, but less popular with watersports participants and swimmers.
Lake Rotorua flows directly into Lake Rotoiti via the Ohau Channel at the north eastern corner of the lake; this channel is navigable by boat and is also favoured by fly fishermen. The Ohau channel joins at the Mourea delta, an area with very low water levels. This area is frequented by novice kayakers and swimmers. Nearby is the ancestral land of the Ngati Pikiao hapu of the Te Arawa tribe. From Lake Rotoiti the waters of Lake Rotorua flow to the Kaituna River into the Pacific Ocean near Maketu; the rapid descent from over 900 feet above sea level in less than 20 km has created an area used for extreme kayaking and white water rafting.

Hugo Aufderbeck (23 March 1909 – 17 January 1981) was a Roman Catholic theologian. He served as Bishop and Apostolic Administrator in the Episcopal Office of Erfurt-Meiningen.
Life
Early years
Aufderbeck was born in Hellefeld, a small village in the heart of the Sauerland countryside, and located some 70 km (45 miles) to the southeast of Dortmund. He attended the local school and then studied Latin for a year with his vicar, Dr. Josef Brill. His early years were spent in a Roman Catholic environment, but he then switched to secondary school, the humanist "Laurentian Gymnasium" in nearby Arnsberg. He concluded his secondary schooling in Paderborn, where he was able to board at the archbishop's boys' seminary ("Seminarium Liborianum"). It was in Paderborn, as a pupil at the city's "Gymnasium Theodorianum" Cathedral School, that on 8 March 1930 he successfully passed his school final exams.
Remaining in Paderborn he now entered the episcopate's and studied Theology. This period also included two sabbatical semesters, in 1932/33, in Vienna and Munich. Then, from 1934 till 1936, he attended the Paderborn Catholic Priest Seminary. On 28 March 1936, in the Cathedral, Archbishop Caspar Klein ordained Hugo Aufderbeck into the priesthood.
Following his ordination Aufderbeck became a religious teacher in Gelsenkirchen at the Franciscan Sisters' Lyceum. In 1937 he began to study at the University of Münster for a higher level teaching qualification. This was cut short in 1938 when the course was closed under pressure from the government. Aufderbeck now relocated to the eastern part of the large Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Paderborn: he became vicar of the provost's parish of Saints Francis and Elizabeth in Halle, also becoming a student chaplain for the city.
Wartime
In 1940 he took on pastoral responsibilities for soldiers in the Halle region, having already since September 1939 been creating a "Soldiers' Circle", in which regular soldiers, regardless of rank, met together. Using the military mail service he had built up and sustained a massive correspondence, which by Easter 1945 and the end of the war had involved several thousand soldiers. Mistrusted by the Gestapo, he was subject to house-searches and interrogation sessions, and by the end of the war at constant risk of arrest and punishment.
During the war Aufderbeck was in contact with the resistance group around Prof. Theodor Lieser. As the end approached Halle was occupied by US troops on 17 April 1945, and Theodor Lieser was installed by them as the city's Lord Mayor. Although Halle was liberated by Americans, by the time war ended zones of occupation had been agreed which placed Halle in the Soviet occupation zone in what remained of Germany, and in July 1945 the Americans withdrew and were replaced by the Red army. Both under US occupation and under the longer period of Soviet administration which followed, Aufderbeck focused on youth work. He was a member of the "Archbishop's Council for Imperiled Youth" ("Erziehungsbeirats für gefährdete Jugendliche") and of the "Advisory Council for Public Youth Support". He was the Roman Catholic representative in liaison with the newly formed Free German Youth (FDJ / Freie Deutsche Jugend). The FDJ was the youth wing of the recently renamed and reconstituted ruling party in this part of Germany, which by the later 1940s was in the process of reverting to one-party dictatorship. In 1947 Aufderbeck was appointed by Wilhelm Weskamm, the episcopal commissioner (who later became the Bishop of Berlin) as the permanent representative of the Archbishop's Commission for Youth Work in the Province of Saxony. The context for these developments, and for much of Aufdebeck's subsequent career, was the political frontier which since 1945 had divided the eastern half of the Paderborn archdiocese from Paderborn itself. Although this secular border was initially thoroughly porous, it would become progressively less so after the reinvention, formally in October 1949, of the Soviet occupation zone as the new Soviet sponsored German Democratic Republic. Because of the way in which FDJ activity was ever more overtly blended into the increasingly ubiquitous political activity of the ruling SED (party), Aufderbeck's contacts with the FDJ were fairly soon abandoned.
Soviet occupation zone / German Democratic Republic
In 1948 Weskamm made Aufderbeck responsible for building up and directing spiritual support on behalf of the Archdiocesan Commission. The political division of Germany was becoming accepted as a permanent aspect of the post-war legacy. Within this political reality Aufderbeck and Weskamm, and then Weskamm's successor created an increasingly separate structure for the eastern part of the Paderborn archdiocese, and in the process constructed an important spiritual and administrative focus for the Roman Catholic church in the German Democratic Republic. Of particular importance are Aufderbeck's efforts regarding liturgical renewal, the "priestless" offices in remoter areas, with Communion celebrated by members of the laity, and his work at preparing priests and believers for ideological confrontation with Communism.
In 1955 he became a member of the Liturgical Commission of the Fulda Bishops' Conference of Pastoral Theologians in the German speaking lands. In 1956, at the invitation of the Trier based German Liturgical Institute, he took part in the first international Pastoral Liturgical Congress, held at Assisi. In 1958 he was appointed a Papal chamberlain and in 1959 a Papal Honorary Prelate. On 19 June 1962 The Pope appointed Aufderbeck Titular bishop of Arca in Phonicia and an Auxiliary bishop with his base in Erfurt. The sudden erection in August 1961 of the Berlin Wall had made it clearer than ever that the eastern part of the Paderborn archdiocese could no longer be administered from Paderborn. Aufderbeck received his episcopal ordination on 5 September 1962 from Archbishop of Berlin (later Cardinal) Alfred Bengsch.
Death
Aufderbeck became aware of his incurable cancer in 1977. He signed his last will on 15 December 1980. He died on 17 January 1981 in the Erfurt Catholic Hospital.

Loughborough Central Station is a railway station on the Great Central Railway and the Great Central Railway (preserved) serving Loughborough.
History
The station was opened by the Great Central Railway on 15 March 1899, built to the standard GCR arrangement of having an island platform set between the two main running lines. The platforms are long, capable of accommodating consists of up to 6 coaches and/or mail vans. The station buildings are unique on the preserved railway, the only station with a complete canopy, the longest in railway preservation. The station was closed by British Rail under the Beeching Axe, on 5 May 1969.
Reopened by the Great Central Railway as part of the restored heritage railway in 1974, train services currently run south from the station to . Within the station complex, the station buildings, original GCR signal box sited to the north, and the three original water tanks are all Grade II listed.
Station masters

P.B. Hand ca. 1929 - 1931 (afterwards station master at Luton)
Henry Ernest Algar 1931 - 1937 (formerly station master at Nottingham High Level station)
A. Smith 1937 - ???? (formerly station master at Bingham)
Station facilities
Original station facilities include: ladies' waiting room and powder room; general waiting room; gentlemen's toilets; and a refreshment room/cafe. In 2009, a £20,000 grant allowed the station to have new toilets, and a lift in the entrance hall to be installed for the benefits of the disabled visitors. The railway society has also added a book and gift shop, a museum, and an emporium/shop.
All stations on the preserved Great Central Railway are set in a specific era; at Loughborough this era is the 1950s. Many artefacts around the station aid in this atmosphere, including original and recreated British Railways posters, British Railways totem poles, a 1950s TV showing 1950s transportation films in the general waiting room, and a display of 1950s platform trolleys and bicycles.
The station also plays host to the command centre of the heritage railway operations, from which the Duty Traffic Manager organizes all movements which take place on the railway from the Station Master's Office.
Media
The station has appeared in many film and television programmes, chosen for its retro aesthetic, such as Enigma, Shadowlands and Cemetery Junction. The station and Great Central Railway line were also featured in the fourth episode of the 17th series of BBC's Top Gear programme, shown on 17 July 2011 during a train/car feature, which was filmed in June 2011.
Running shed
From a long fenced pathway alongside the northward line, the running shed can be viewed. This large 3-road building has to accommodate both residential and visiting motive power, as well as serving as a workshop. Unlike most other railways, it is possible to go inside and see "most" of the steam locomotives in various stages of completion. Only the third road is inaccessible to the general public.
The current Loughborough Gap project will result in the shed being demolished, due to its position intercepting the line to Ruddington. The replacement is a 10-road from in Cumbria, which will be rebuilt brick-by-brick into an 8-road shed, which could have enough storage for 16 large tender engines. The brownfield site on which it will eventually be built, will include the shed itself (half of which will be converted into a workshop), a second carriage works, storage sidings and an education centre for school groups.

Role in society
TFBoys is considered to be one of the most popular Chinese boy bands and is seen as a Chinese pop-culture sensation. Since their debut in 2013, they have won many major music awards and earned more than 200 million Weibo followers combined. Their sales of band merchandise average more than $17 million per month. Their success was attributed to their fresh school-boy looks, which filled the void of young male idol groups in China; as well as their "wholesome and boy-next-door" image. Their impact has extended beyond the music industry, with their members appearing in films, television shows as well as commercial films.
Due to their image, the group has won a large number of "mother fans", women in their mid–20s to 60s who have developed maternal instincts for the boys.
The group has also amassed a large number of international fans due to their catchy music and versatile talents. The group has contributed in building China's "soft status", by influencing many fans around the world to learn Chinese.
With increased popularity and influence, the group now promotes philanthropic causes. Its members have set up charitable foundations to support education in rural areas and promote environmental protection. The group was ranked No. 1 on the 2017 Charitable Celebrity List in China.
Politics
The government supports the boy band group, which has been featured for four consecutive years (2016–2019) on the CCTV New Year's Gala. The Communist Youth League's official Weibo account often promotes the group's activities. On the International Children's Day in 2015, the Communist Youth League released a video featuring TFBoys singing "We Are the Heirs of Communism", the song of the Young Pioneers. They have been selected as a brand ambassador of China's 2020 Chinese Mars Mission. The band is part of the government's efforts to promote its policies among China's youth. Critic Zhu Dake sees the boy band as serving to provide modernized propaganda.
Artistry
The group's musical style is mainly dance-style music with rap elements, often classified as "bubblegum pop". Their songs have been noted for having uplifting and positive lyrics, which explores the trials of growing up and teenage love, such as "Manual of Youth" and "Imperfect Kid".

Outdoor Elvis is the second album by rock band The Swirling Eddies, released in 1989 on Alarma Records.
The title track found the Swirling Eddies in search of the elusive Elvis Presley who, according to the song, escaped the city by faking his own death and decided to make his home in the wilderness. The song makes parallels between the search for Elvis, the search for Bigfoot and mankind's search for a king or "savior."
This project gave the Swirling Eddies their first hit songs - "Driving In England" which made it all the way to #1 in some markets, and "Hide the Beer, the Pastor's Here" which also created a small amount of controversy for the album. The latter song tells the tale of a Christian College professor that hides his own hidden sins and attacks his students for their obvious drinking habits. At the end of the song, "Spot" shouts out the name of Christian Colleges around the United States. Some of these colleges were upset that they were mentioned in the song while others were upset that they weren't included.
One song on the album, "Mystery Babylon," had earlier been premiered on the Swirling Eddies Apology Video, which had been sent out to fans that ordered the Spittle & Phlegm video collection.
Outdoor Elvis marks the first appearance of new Swirling Eddies member Prickly Disco. It is also the first appearance of the guest Eddie known as Miracle Babe, whom contributes background vocals on the album.

Fragment-based lead discovery (FBLD) also known as fragment-based drug discovery (FBDD) is a method used for finding lead compounds as part of the drug discovery process. Fragments are small organic molecules which are small in size and low in molecular weight. It is based on identifying small chemical fragments, which may bind only weakly to the biological target, and then growing them or combining them to produce a lead with a higher affinity. FBLD can be compared with high-throughput screening (HTS). In HTS, libraries with up to millions of compounds, with molecular weights of around 500 Da, are screened, and nanomolar binding affinities are sought. In contrast, in the early phase of FBLD, libraries with a few thousand compounds with molecular weights of around 200 Da may be screened, and millimolar affinities can be considered useful. FBLD is a technique being used in research for discovering novel potent inhibitors. This methodology could help to design multitarget drugs for multiple diseases. The multitarget inhibitor approach is based on designing an inhibitor for the multiple targets. This type of drug design opens up new polypharmacological avenues for discovering innovative and effective therapies. Neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's (AD) and Parkinson's, among others, also show rather complex etiopathologies. Multitarget inhibitors are more appropriate for addressing the complexity of AD and may provide new drugs for controlling the multifactorial nature of AD, stopping its progression.
Library design
In analogy to the rule of five, it has been proposed that ideal fragments should follow the 'rule of three' (molecular weight < 300, ClogP < 3, the number of hydrogen bond donors and acceptors each should be < 3 and the number of rotatable bonds should be < 3). Since the fragments have relatively low affinity for their targets, they must have high water solubility so that they can be screened at higher concentrations.
Library screening and quantification
In fragment-based drug discovery, the low binding affinities of the fragments pose significant challenges for screening. Many biophysical techniques have been applied to address this issue. In particular, ligand-observe nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) methods such as water-ligand observed via gradient spectroscopy (waterLOGSY), saturation transfer difference spectroscopy (STD-NMR), 19F NMR spectroscopy and inter-ligand Overhauser effect (ILOE) spectroscopy, protein-observe NMR methods such as 1H-15N heteronuclear single quantum coherence (HSQC) that utilises isotopically-labelled proteins, surface plasmon resonance (SPR), isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) and Microscale Thermophoresis (MST) are routinely-used for ligand screening and for the quantification of fragment binding affinity to the target protein. At modern X-ray crystallography synchrotron beamlines, several hundred data sets of protein-ligand complex crystal structures can be obtained within 24 hours. This technology makes crystallographic fragment screening possible, i.e. the use of X-ray crystallography directly for the fragment screening step.
Once a fragment (or a combination of fragments) have been identified, protein X-ray crystallography is used to obtain structural models of the protein- complexes. Such information can then be used to guide organic synthesis for high-affinity protein ligands and enzyme inhibitors.
Advantages over traditional libraries
Advantages of screening low molecular weight fragment based libraries over traditional higher molecular weight chemical libraries are several. These include:
More hydrophilic hits in which hydrogen bonding is more likely to contribute to affinity (enthalpically driven binding). It is generally much easier to increase affinity by adding hydrophobic groups (entropically driven binding); starting with a hydrophilic ligand increases the chances that the final optimized ligand will not be too hydrophobic (log P < 5).
Higher ligand efficiency so that the final optimized ligand will more likely be relatively low in molecular weight (MW < 500).
Since two to three fragments in theory can be combined to form an optimized ligand, screening a fragment library of N compounds is equivalent to screening N2 - N3 compounds in a traditional library.
Fragments are less likely to contain sterically blocking groups that interfere with an otherwise favorable ligand-protein interaction, increasing the combinatorial advantage of a fragment library even further.

Anders Svor (December 14, 1864 – May 2, 1929) was a Norwegian sculptor. He was a Realist influenced by Romanticism, and Auguste Rodin was also an important inspiration. His work was also part of the sculpture event in the art competition at the 1924 Summer Olympics.
Life
Svor was a farmer's son, the child of Rasmus Kristofer Svor (1835–1914) and Ragnhild Svor née Seljeset (1834–1902). He was born and raised at the Svor farm in Hornindal. Already as a boy he showed unusual abilities in wood carving, which would be the start of his artist life.
At the age of 17, he traveled to Kristiania (now Oslo), where he began as a woodcutter at the Hals Brothers piano factory. Later he became a student at the Royal Drawing School (now the Norwegian National Academy of Craft and Art Industry), where he studied under Julius Middelthun. At the age of 21 he went to Copenhagen, where he became a student at the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts and studied under Stephan Sinding and Vilhelm Bissen.
Svor lived for a time in Paris, but settled in Kristiania, where he had his studio and residence. He lived alone and died on May 2, 1929. He is buried at Hornindal Church.
In his native Hornindal, the Anders Svor Museum was opened in the village of Grodås in 1953. It contains about 450 works by the artist.
Career
Svor participated in several art exhibitions in Kristiania, Copenhagen, Paris, and Chicago. Svor experienced his great breakthrough with his sculpture David. At an international art exhibition in Berlin in 1891, he received a gold medal for this work of art, a prestigious award. The statue was destroyed while being shipped from an exhibit in Chicago. Together with Sofus Madsen, Svor participated in the 1924 Summer Olympics in Paris with his sculpture Diskoskaster (Discus Thrower).
In 1891 Svor won the competition for the Tordenskjold monument in Kristiania. However, he was unable to complete it, which was a difficult blow for the young artist. After his death, Svor's Tordenskiold-statuen (Tordenskjold Statue) was unveiled by King Olav V in Horten, and a copy was unveiled by Crown Prince Harald at Haakonsvern.
Regarding Svor's sculpture Bølgen (The Wave) exhibited at Skillebekk and Etter badet (After the Bath) outside Bislet Baths, the novelist Edvard Hoem wrote that he was struck by what the statues express; that they have "both excitement and grace." According to Hoem, Svor's work was overshadowed by the dominant sculptor Gustav Vigeland. The writer Morten Johan Svendsen writes that Svor's figurative imagery seems "both outdated and foreign today," while both Svendsen and the writer Inge Fænn believe that Svor was one of Norway's foremost sculptors after Vigeland.

Surname law can refer to any law regulating the use of surnames.
Canada
From 1941 to 1978, the Government of Canada issued disc numbers to identify Inuit in their records. In the mid-1960s Project Surname began, and, headed by Abe Okpik, Inuit were given surnames in a similar manner to how surnames were used among Canadians of European descent.
Iceland
Icelandic law enforces the conventions of Icelandic names, which require that the last name be derived from a given name of the father or mother, suffixed with "-son" or "-dóttir". The law allows both derivations to be used, and for foreign last names to be inherited or kept by foreigners. This means that a father, mother, and child will all typically have different last names. Foreigners who marry an Icelander and get Icelandic citizenship can take the last name of their partner, or a patronym or matronym from the name of a parent or parent-in-law; these possibilities are not necessarily open to native Icelanders.
Iran
Reza Shah Pahlavi ordered Iranians to adopt Western style surnames in place of old Islamic names and titles during his reign.
Japan
A law in Japan, dating from 1896, requires a married couple to have a common surname. Most commonly it was the wife who took her husband's name. In 2011, this law was challenged as unconstitutional on gender equality grounds, but the Supreme Court of Japan upheld the law in 2015.
Prussian-ruled Poland
Prussia tasked the implementation of surnames to E. T. A. Hoffmann.
Thailand
According to the current law, Person Name Act, BE 2505 (1962), to create a new Thai name, it must not be longer than ten Thai letters, excluding vowel symbols and diacritics. The same law also forbids the creation of a surname that duplicated any existing surnames, but there are some duplicates dating to the time before computer databases were available to prevent this. Some creations added the name of their location (muban, tambon or amphoe) into surnames, similar to family name suffixes.
Turkey
On 21 June 1934, Turkey adopted the Surname Law which required all its citizens to adopt and use Western-style surnames. Only names with Turkish origin were permitted, and non-Turks with pre-existing surnames were required to adopt new Turkish names.

The Ancient Egyptian anatomical studies are an article about the history of anatomy within ancient Egypt.
Overview
From a period spanning the time beginning at about 3100 B.C. to the finish of the 2nd century A.D., anatomical studies were fore-most within the ancient Egyptian nation, than within other parts of the world, according to archaeological evidence. People of the ancient Egyptian civilization initiated an independent practice of anatomical study, which represented the first movement within humanity toward the development of an understanding of anatomy; Egypt is where the study of anatomy historically first developed. People belonging to the Egyptian nation were the first to make a written record of anatomical studies.
Manetho is thought to have recorded the work of an early anatomist. In his work History of Egypt Manetho states the pharaoh Djer was an anatomist, although a source considers the likelihood of the pharaoh being an anatomist to be low. Djer is stated to have been the first to have made a written work on the study of anatomy, entitled Practical Medicine and Anatomical Book, which is known of, but not extant, although this attribution may represent an honorific observance indicating the book was written within the reign of the pharaoh, within which the book is known to have been written.
Two individuals, Herophilus, and Erasistratus, both living within Alexandria and participating within the so-called School of Alexandria, both contributed to anatomical understanding and knowledge, as they began a practice of human dissection.
Egyptian civilization was responsible for the advent of terms for external body parts, of all body parts practitioners were aware of, metu, understood to refer to the heart, was central to ancient understandings of anatomy within relevant areas of Egypt.
Sources
Knowledge of anatomical studies is drawn from papyri and ostraca, especially the Ebers, Edwin Smith and Kahun Papyri. One of only two extant texts on creating a mummy is the Ritual of Embalming Papyrus. Mummification techniques led to advancement in anatomical knowledge.
Ebers Papyrus
The Ebers Papyrus describes metu, which is a word referring to vascular structures, ducts, tendons, or perhaps nerves, which run to various parts of the human head, of these there are a number amounting to fifty-two metu described within the Ebers.
Edwin Smith Papyrus
The Edwin Smith Papyrus shows the very first use of the root word neuro, and the word brain, and details information on the meninges and cerebrospinal fluid. The text describes in appreciably realistic terms, anatomical structures while detailing injuries in order of anatomy.

A pilgrim's way or pilgrim way is a standard route that pilgrims take when they go on a pilgrimage in order to reach their destination – usually a holy site or place of worship. These sites may be towns or cities of special significance such as Jerusalem, Rome, Santiago de Compostela, Fátima, Lourdes or Einsiedeln, but may also be specific points in the countryside, such as a hill, spring, well, cave or shrine. On the route there are stations where pilgrims can stop and rest, where prayers may be said or religious services observed.
History
In the Middle Ages there were three main Christian pilgrimage sites: Jerusalem, Rome and Santiago de Compostela in Spain. The large pilgrimage sites were often the graves of important apostles. The most famous pilgrims' way today is the one to Santiago de Compostela in Spain, also known as the Way of St. James. Another very old pilgrim way, the Via Francigena, runs from Canterbury in England through France and Switzerland to Rome.
These routes were also linked to Jerusalem via the Jerusalem Way. For example, individual sections may be viewed by as the Way of St. James, as well as a pilgrim way to another place. Together with the various approach paths, these main routes form a network of old pilgrim routes that cross the whole of Europe. Today there are St. James societies in almost all European countries that are dedicated to the research and maintenance of the Way of St. James. In Germany the historical pilgrim ways are researched by the German St. James Society (Deutsche St. Jakobus-Gesellschaft). In Switzerland this is carried out by the Union of the Friends of the Way of St. James (Vereinigung der Freunde des Jakobsweges).
Because Christians understand themselves to be always "on a journey", parish and diocesan development concepts are often described as pilgrimages or pilgrim ways. One well-known such example is the so-called Pilgrimage of Trust on Earth of the ecumenical Taizé Community. The Evangelical-Lutheran Church of Hanover has developed a project with the name "Loccum–Volkenroda Pilgrims' Way". In 1987 during the Olof Palme Peace March, on the instigation of the Action Reconciliation Service for Peace, a multi-day pilgrimage was made along a pilgrim way from Ravensbrück concentration camp to Sachsenhausen concentration camp. The route recalled the death marches of 1945.

Kappa Lambda Chi Military Fraternity Inc. ( or KLC) is a non-collegiate, national service based fraternity, considered a professional fraternity. Kappa Lambda Chi was founded as a professional fraternity that caters exclusively to the military members of all branches. Today, Kappa Lambda Chi has more than 20 Chapters in the continental United States and abroad.
History
Kappa Lambda Chi was founded on July 4, 2013, in Clinton, North Carolina, as an alternative to traditional Greek letter organizations for male service members. KLC is the very first Greek-lettered fraternity established and incorporated by U.S. Armed Forces men. Fraternity members currently serve or have previously served their country honorably in all branches of the United States Military.
Kappa Lambda Chi members support veterans in need in and around their local communities through volunteer service. Members work with homeless shelters, abuse centers, children centers, and other organizations that provide hands on support to organization that do not receive the support from external sources. Members also honor those who have served this nation by placing wreaths on the graves of veterans and service members in each branch of the military including Merchant Marines, prisoners of war and those named missing in action.
Kappa Lambda Chi Military Fraternity Incorporated was built as an alternative for male service members whom want to become a part of a Greek letter organization. The three founding members: Sir Zachary D.S. Wyatt II, William Dickey, James K. Jackson took pride in the development of the first Greek-lettered military fraternity and created a unique Brotherhood for both past and present members of the United States Armed Forces.
Original 9
Kappa Lambda Chi's 3 founding members are Sir Zachary D. S. Wyatt II (Air Force Veteran), William C. Dickey (Army Retired), and James K. Jackson (Army Retired). Their 6 founding board members are Demetrius Blalock (Army Retired), Gary Degraffenreidt (Army Reserve), Dennis G. Morton Jr. (Army Retired), Kevin Taylor (Army Retired), Daryl Harris II (Active Navy), and Dana McGhee (Air Force Retired).

Liangjiang, officially known as Liangjiang New Area (), is a state-level new area situated in the municipality of Chongqing, China. The area covers 1,205 square kilometres combining part of Jiangbei District, Yubei District, and Beibei District.
Overview
After Shanghai's Pudong New Area and Tianjin's Binhai New Area, China's only inland and third sub-provincial new area – Chongqing's Liangjiang New Area – was set up with the approval of the State Council on June 16, 2010, the 13th anniversary since Chongqing became China's fourth municipality. Liangjiang New Area, located in the main urban districts of Chongqing, north of the Yangtze River and east of the Jialing River, covers 1,200 square kilometers, of which 550 square kilometers is available for construction and composed of Jiangbei, Yubei and Beibei administrative district, the North New Zone and China's first inland bonded zone, Lianglu Cuntan Bonded Port Area. Chongqing Liangjiang New Area Development & Investment Group Co., Ltd. is in charge of constructing the industrial parks.
Strategic position
According to the approval of the State Council, Chongqing Liangjiang New Area will play roles of a pilot area for the comprehensive urban-rural reform; an important modern manufacturing base and comprehensive transport hub of China; a trade, commercial and logistics centre as well as a financial and technological innovation centre of the upper reaches of the Yangtze; an important gateway of the inland region opening to the outside world and a model for the scientific development.
Transport advantages
As the geographic core of the inland, Chongqing Municipality, located at the connection region of the west and middle China, enjoys a three-dimensional traffic network linking the south and north China and will form three transport hubs of China's fourth largest international airport, inland river transport's biggest port and the junction of eight railways. The local logistics cost is greatly cut with the new way created by Liangjiang New Area, the opening of New Eurasia Land Bridge and the access to the Indian Ocean, which provides advantageous conditions for the new area in attracting world's production factors and establishing a rapid carrying-over platform. All can indicate that Liangjiang New Area has been in the forefront of the opening-up project in inland China.
Reasonable space structure and industrial layout
In terms of space structure, Liangjiang New Area is divided into three sectors of modern service industry, advanced manufacturing industry and urban comprehensive functional zone and composed of ten functional zones of Jiangbeizui CBD, Bonded Areas, Yufu Modern Manufacturing and Logistics Zone, Longxing Advanced Manufacturing Zone, North Urban Economic Zone, Airport lingang Industrial Zone, Yulai Exhibition Center, Caijia Hi-tech Industrial Zone, Shuifu Ecosystem Industrial Zone and Mugu Export Processing Zone. In terms of industrial layout, the area will form five strategic industries of rail transit, electric power (nuclear power and wind power, etc.), new energy automobiles, electronic information and energy conservation materials. In addition, the layout will focus on 3 strategic functions of national research and development headquarters, important transformation base for scientific research achievements and data center. Furthermore, the area will speed up developing a group of emerging industry clusters to form a "5+3" layout.
Preferential policies
The State Council provides Liangjiang New Area with unprecedented preferential policies to increase support for further industry, capital and human talents development. The three preferential policies of West Development, coordination of the comprehensive urban and rural reform and experience of Pudong and Binhai new area will take effect in the area, marking Liangjiang New Area to be the one with most preferential policies in China. The area unveils a series of preferential policies, such as enterprises income tax is reduced to 15%, arousing great attention in the world.
Good foundation for development
Liangjiang New Area in an "old + new" style includes the inland China's only bonded port, the largest conference center in the west, finance and trade center and so on, while Pudong and Binhai new area were built from nothing. Liangjiang New Area gained a gross domestic product of around 80 billion yuan, 13 and 4 times of Pudong and Binhai at their beginning. On the basis of "take Chongqing as the base, provide service to west China, depend on the economy belt along the Yangtze River, open to the outside world", the CPC Chongqing Committee and Chongqing Municipal Government definite the "Three Three-Step Strategy" for the Development of Liangjiang New Area, "to achieve initial success in 2 years, to take a shape in 5 years and to basically complete in 10 years". The area in 2012 will get the gross domestic product (GDP) of 0.16 trillion yuan with an increase of 100%; in 2015, the GDP will be more than 0.32 trillion yuan; in 2020, Liangjiang New Area will be the inland China's open model with modern functions, advanced industries, gathering headquarters, livable environment and international influence. Its GDP and industrial gross output will hit 0.64 trillion and 1 trillion yuan respectively, which is the same as "reconstructing one more Chongqing industry and Chongqing economy in 10 years".

Alpine borane is the commercial name for an organoboron compound that is used in organic synthesis. It is a colorless liquid, although it is usually encountered as a solution.
Preparation and reactions
This reagent is generated by treating 9-BBN with α-pinene.
This sterically crowded chiral trialkylborane can stereoselectively reduce aldehydes in what is known as the Midland Alpine borane reduction, or simply the Midland reduction:
C8H12B-pinanyl + RCDO → C8H12BOCHDR + (+)-d-pinene
Hydrolysis of the resulting borinic ester affords the alcohol:
C8H12BOCHDR + H2O → C8H12BOH + HOCHDR
It is also effective for the stereoselective reduction of certain acetylenic ketones.
The reaction is proposed to involve formation of an adduct by coordination of the carbonyl oxygen to boron. Intramolecular hydride transfer from the pinane substituent to the carbonyl carbon ensues.
Related reagents
A range of alkyl-substituted borane are specialty reagents in organic synthesis. Two such reagents that are closely related to Alpine borane are 9-BBN and diisopinocampheylborane.

The Party of Rights () was a Croatian nationalist political party in Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia and later in Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes.
It was founded in 1861 by Ante Starčević and Eugen Kvaternik, two influential nationalist politicians who advocated for greater Croatian autonomy and later for the independence of the Croatian state. Moderate and hardline nationalist factions existed during the period and after Starčević's death, the party would embrace anti-Serb, anti-Yugoslav and Republicanist leadership. In 1929, the party was dissolved after the proclamation of the 6 January Dictatorship and soon after, some members joined the underground organization Ustaše which was led by Ante Pavelić. After the dissolution of Yugoslavia, numerous Croatian and Bosnian Croat political parties claim the lineage from the party itself.
Kingdom of Croatia
The Party of Rights was founded on 26 June 1861 when Ante Starčević and Eugen Kvaternik first presented the policies of the "Party of Rights" to the Croatian Parliament. They called for greater Croatian autonomy and self-rule at a time when Croatia was divided into several crownlands within the Habsburg Monarchy.
In early October 1871, Kvaternik and several other party members disavowed the official party position, which advocated a political solution, and instead launched the Rakovica revolt. The rebels declared the following aims:
freedom of the Croatian people from Austrian and Magyar (Hungarian) oppression
proclamation of an independent Croatia
equality under law
municipal self-government
abolition of the Military Frontier and introduction of free counties
respect for both religions in love and unity
The rebels also sought to encourage participation of Orthodox Serbs in the revolt, and some of them did, but the uprising was soon crushed by the authorities. Most of the rebels were killed, including Kvaternik.
The party ran in the 1883 Croatian parliamentary by-election and the 1884 Croatian parliamentary election. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the party underwent various changes in membership and policy, as different factions splintered and reconciled over time.
These factions often clashed over whom best represented Croatian state rights.
During the 1895 visit of Emperor Franz Joseph to Zagreb, a flag-burning incident happened, that was disavowed by the party leader Fran Folnegović. However, Ante Starčević disagreed, and he and his followers, notably Eugen Kumičić and Josip Frank (a Jewish convert to Catholicism), formed the first Pure Party of Rights (). Starčević died in 1896, and was succeeded by Josip Frank under whose leadership the party became fixated on anti-Serb sentiment.
In the 1897 Croatian parliamentary election, both parties ran. In 1902, the two Parties reconciled; however, in 1905 the leadership of the party, led by Frano Supilo, merged into the Croat-Serb Coalition, and the Pure Party of Rights was formed once again. Starčević's Party of Rights participated in the 1908 Croatian parliamentary election. The next year, in 1909, the Pure Party of Rights itself splintered, as Mile Starčević, Ante Pavelić and others accused Frank of consorting with Pavao Rauch. The dissidents formed Starčević's Party of Rights. Both the Starčević and the Frank Party of Rights participated in the 1910 Croatian parliamentary election. In 1911, Frank died, and the two factions merged into the latter. In 1913, the Pure Party of Rights was formed by old supporters of Frank, this time led by . Both Parties participated in the 1913 Croatian parliamentary election.
Kingdom of Dalmatia
The Party of Rights also operated in Dalmatia, which was separated from Croatia and Slavonia at the time. They participated in the Dalmatian elections in 1895, 1901 and 1908.
After World War I
The Croatian Party of Rights welcomed the dissolution of Austria-Hungary in the wake of World War I as a means toward achieving Croatian independence, through the creation of the State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs. In October 1918, Party of Rights announced their dismissal. However, just one month later, party's activity was renewed when the Business Committee of the Party held a session on 28 November 1918, announcing the renewal of party's activity and their goal to save national and state individuality. When the State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs proclaimed its unification with Kingdom of Serbia on 1 December 1918, Party of Rights organized a protest. On 1 March 1919, the same day the Temporary National Representation met without them present, the Party of Rights changed its name to Croatian Party of Rights.
In their program from March 1919, members of the party made a plea for Croatian independence based on the right to self-determination of all peoples. In this program, the Party of Rights emphasized their republicanism as opposed to the monarchism of House of Karađorđević, whose rule was accepted by all Croatian politicians, except Stjepan Radić's Croatian Peasant Party. Their main goal were the ideas of Ante Starčević for an independent Croatian state, and the "Croatian State Right" () was their main argument for achieving this goal. According to the concept of the "Croatian State Right", they expressed a need for unification of all Croat lands, including Bosnia and Herzegovina. The program was signed by President of the Party of Rights, dr. Vladimir Prebeg and Secretary of the Party, Ante Pavelić.
A unified Party of Rights participated in the 1920 Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes Constitutional Assembly election. The Croatian politics at the time started to be dominated by the Croatian Peasant Party, but in 1921, the Croatian parties started to form the Croatian National Representation (Croatian Bloc) that included the Party of Rights. Stjepan Radić and other coalition leaders ejected the Party of Rights from the coalition by the end of 1922.
The Party of Rights ran standalone in the 1923 Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes parliamentary election. It did not enter the 1925 Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes parliamentary election, but did join the Bloc again the same year. The Party of Rights cooperated with Stjepan Radić as part of the Croatian Bloc, composed of the Croatian Republican Peasant Party, Croatian Union and the Party of Rights.
The Party of Rights alone was unable to influence the majority of Croats, as their main supporters were a small number of middle class citizens, the majority of whom lived in Zagreb, while Stjepan Radić dominated among Croats elsewhere. Within this bloc, Party of Rights opposed Serbian nationalist hegemony and centralism. Sometimes they objected to Radić's readiness to come to an understanding with the Serbian side. The main vehicle of the Party of Rights was the concept of the Croatian Right (), which made the idea of Yugoslavism unsustainable, assessing it as misconception and the main obstacle to Croatian independence.
Nevertheless, the leaders of the Party of Rights had established contacts with the People's Radical Party in Belgrade and occasionally fought for their own particular interests. In 1924–25, this controversial relationship became public, particularly as the party's then-vice-president Mirko Košutić publicly accused the rest of the party leadership of colluding with the government of Nikola Pašić against the interests of the Croatian Bloc.
In 1929, the king of Yugoslavia instituted the January 6th Dictatorship. He banned all political parties, and the militant wing of the Party of Rights went underground to organize the Ustaše movement, led by former party secretary Ante Pavelić, whose wing of the party was the most staunchly anti-Serb.
Legacy
The eponymous Croatian Party of Rights, founded in 1990, claims lineage from the original Party of Rights. Since 1990, several splinter parties have been founded that claim the same:
Croatian Pure Party of Rights,
Croatian Party of Rights 1861,
Autochthonous Croatian Party of Rights,
Croatian Party of Rights Dr. Ante Starčević,
Croatian Party of Rights of Bosnia and Herzegovina,

The 795th Bombardment Squadron is a former United States Army Air Forces unit. The squadron was organized in 1943 as one of the first Boeing B-29 Superfortress units. After training in the United States, The squadron moved to India and participated in the strategic bombing campaign against Japan, earning a Distinguished Unit Citation before being disbanded on 12 October 1944 when the Army Air Forces reorganized its very heavy bomber groups to consist of only three squadrons.
History
Organization and training in the United States
The squadron was first organized at Smoky Hill Army Air Field, Kansas on 1 August 1943 as one of the four original squadrons of the 468th Bombardment Group. It was intended to be a Boeing B-29 Superfortress squadron, however due to the lack of B-29 availability, it was initially equipped with Boeing B-17 Flying Fortresses. Smoky Hill was one of four bases chosen for B-29 training based on their proximity to Boeing's factory at Wichita, Kansas, where most of the early Superfortresses would be produced.
Delays in producing the B-29, labor disputes at the engine manufacturer, and modifications to the planes to make them ready for combat resulted in belated deliveries to combat units and it was close to the end of 1943 before aircrews could train in the new bomber in any number. Ground echelon personnel began shipping out to prepare the airfields for the bombers without completing their training in the United States. The air echelon of the squadron trained with the B-29 in Kansas until March 1944, when it departed for its first overseas base, Kharagpur Airfield, Bengal, India, to participate in Operation Matterhorn, which called for B-29 attacks from advanced bases in China, while the bombers' main bases were in India. The squadron completed its training and deployed from the United States to India in March 1944, flying across the South Atlantic and Africa to reach its combat station.
Combat operations
The squadron arrived at Kharagpur in mid-April. Once all elements of the 468th Group had arrived at Kharagpur in June, the squadron became part of Twentieth Air Force, which reported directly to Headquarters, Army Air Forces, bypassing theater command. Its initial missions were transporting supplies and equipment to staging airfields in China, and it did not fly its first combat mission until 5 June, when it participated in a raid on railroad repair facilities near Bangkok, Thailand. Ten days later, it participated in the first attack on the Japanese Home Islands since the Doolittle Raid two years earlier. Attacks on Japan required staging through forward bases in China, and squadron bombers consumed twelve gallons of fuel to transport one gallon that could be used for combat missions. The squadron moved its available aircraft to its forward base at Pengshan Airfield near Chengtu. Staging of B-29s, already armed and loaded with bombs began on 13 June and was only completed on the day of the raid, with only refueling needed in China. The primary target for this mission was the Imperial Steel Works at Yawata.
The unit staged through bases not only in China for attacks on Japan, but from other bases in India and Ceylon. It conducted mining operations off the coasts of French Indochina, near Saigon and China, near Shanghai. It attacked Japanese targets in Southeast Asia, including aircraft factories, naval installations, transportation facilities and iron works, and it flew sorties to targets as distant as Indonesia. In August 1944, the squadron again struck the Imperial Steel Works in Yawata,, earning a Distinguished Unit Citation. Fighter opposition on this attack included the first experience of a Japanese fighter plane intentionally ramming a B-29.
In October 1944, the 468th Bombardment Group was reorganized, along with other groups in XX Bomber Command. The squadron was disbanded and its planes and crews were used to increase the size of the 468th Group's remaining three squadrons.

The Third Cage is the third collaboration between guitarist Dario Mollo and former Black Sabbath vocalist Tony Martin. All music was written by Mollo, with Martin contributing the lyrics. Mollo also produced, mixed and mastered the album.
Reception
The Third Cage was met with mostly positive reviews upon its release. Most reviewers praised Mollo's guitar work in particular and the heavier songs, but criticized some tracks as being "by-the-numbers '80s pop metal". The album's opening and closing tracks, "Wicked World" and "Violet Moon", are often cited as stand-out tracks, the former as an example of a hard rock song "written and performed almost to perfection" and the latter for its "emotive essence".

The Hudson Mountains are a mountain range in western Ellsworth Land just east of Cranton Bay and Pine Island Bay at the eastern extremity of Amundsen Sea. They are of volcanic origin, consisting of low scattered mountains and nunataks that protrude through the West Antarctic Ice Sheet. The Hudson Mountains are bounded on the north by Cosgrove Ice Shelf and on the south by Pine Island Glacier.
Geology
The Hudson Mountains contain slightly eroded parasitic cones that overlie three extensively eroded Miocene stratovolcanoes: Mount Manthe, Teeters Nunatak and Mount Moses. Potential steam was reported in 1974 and an unconfirmed report of an eruption detected by satellite was made in 1985, indicating that the Hudson Mountains may be volcanically active.
Volcanic activity of the Hudson Mountains has produced predominantly subaerial basaltic lava flows, although subglacial or subaqueous tuffs and lava flows have also been noted. A tephra layer deposited from a subglacial eruption has been dated at about 200 BCE based on ice thickness.
History
The mountains were discovered by members of the USAS in flights from the in February 1940, and further delineated from air photos taken by USN Operation Highjump in December 1946. The full extent of the group was mapped by USGS from US Navy air photos of 1966. Named by US-SCAN after Captain William L. Hudson, commander of during USEE, 1838–1842. Peacock, accompanied by under Lieutenant Walker, cruised along the edge of the pack to the north of this area for several days during the latter part of March 1839.
On January, 2008, the British Antarctic Survey scientists led by Hugh Corr and David Vaughan, reported (in the journal Nature Geoscience) that 2,200 years ago, a volcano had a subglacial eruption under the Antarctic ice sheet, based on airborne survey with radar images. Described as the biggest eruption in Antarctica in the last 10,000 years, the volcanic ash was found deposited on the ice surface under the Hudson Mountains, close to Pine Island Glacier.

The heart of the Belchen System is the southernmost mountain of the Vosges, the Ballon d'Alsace (Elsässer Belchen or Alsatian Belchen, 1,247 metres). Seventy three kilometres due east is the Black Forest Belchen (Schwarzwälder Belchen, 1,414 metres), which is only 167 metres higher and over which the sun rises at the equinoxes, i.e. at the beginning of spring and autumn, as seen from Grand Ballon. Conversely, the sun sets over the Alsatian Belchen on these days when seen from the Black Forest Belchen.
Viewed from the Alsatian Belchen at the time of the summer solstice, the sun rises over Petit Ballon (Kleiner Belchen or Little Belchen, 1,272 metres), 27 kilometres away to the northeast. At the winter solstice it rises over the Belchenflue (Schweizer Belchen or Swiss Belchen, 1,099 metres), 88 kilometres to the southeast. Thus from the Alsatian Belchen the start of all four astronomical seasons is defined.
The region of the Belchen System is known today as the Upper Rhine, the Regio Basiliensis, the Dreiland or RegioTriRhena.

@Cafe, one of New York City's first dedicated internet cafes, was incorporated in early 1995 by Glenn McGinnis, Nicolas Barnes and Chris Townsend and opened its doors on Tuesday, April 25, 1995 with the slogan “Eat, Drink, ‘Net.” Founded at 12 St. Marks Place on the site of the original location of St. Mark's Bookshop, the 2,500 sq foot cafe positioned itself as a place where the formerly solitary pursuits of computing were combined with a social atmosphere of a full bar and restaurant. In addition to the food and drink, the cafe offered dial-up internet services and email accounts through their fly.net web portal. Computer and internet usage was billed at $5 per half-hour. The business idea was inspired by Japanese video game cafes that McGinnis had frequented when he lived in Japan during the 1980s. During the internet's early days when the medium was still mostly unexplored, @Cafe tried to present “the internet at its best,” paying $9,000 a month for a dedicated T1 line and supplying powerful PC or Mac computers at every table.
At the time of @Cafe's opening, the first Netscape browser had just been released; a technological advance that introduced the internet to a more general computer user.
@Cafe soon became a center for patrons curious about the internet, such as famous hacker, Phiber Optik, and was also embraced by New York's burgeoning technology sector known as Silicon Alley. @Cafe also made connections with early internet pioneers The WELL, hosting their ten-year anniversary party a few weeks after they opened and was also an early meet up location of the Women's Technology advocacy group Webgrrls.
@Cafe was one of the first businesses that was predicated on monetizing what had previously been the domain of academics and programmers. When it opened, @Cafe was the largest internet-based cafe in New York City and was the only internet cafe with a full kitchen and bar. It played host to a number of high-profile events, including a failed online meeting between the New York and Boston mayors Rudy Giuliani and Thomas Menino, the launch of the Rolling Stones Voodoo Lounge CD-ROM, The Wall Street Journal's Interactive Edition website premier, a Donna Karan men's fragrance and website debut, and a global and interactive New Year's Eve party on December 31, 1995 with the internet cafes CyberJava in Los Angeles, California and CyberSmith in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Corporate clients MTV, MasterCard, IBM and Budweiser also held technology events at the cafe.
The cafe also played host to an early web/television hybrid program called "Encarta On the Record." The monthly program was moderated by journalist Linda Ellerbee, produced by Microsoft and Ellerbee's production company Lucky Duck and combined a live roundtable discussion with web-based resources through the Encarta web portal. The web audience could ask questions to the panel in real time, the audio of the discussion could be streamed and video images of the proceedings were updated every 8 seconds.
In contemporary interviews, Barnes and McGinnis spoke of opening a number of internet-based cafes around the world, where technology novices and professionals could experience the full potential of the internet.
Despite media and public interest, @Cafe never broke even and closed in 1996 before additional locations or franchises could be opened.

Nina Quartero (born Gladys Quartararo; March 17, 1908 – November 23, 1985) was an American actress whose career spanned from 1929 to 1943.
Career
Born in 1908 in Mount Vernon, New York, as Gladys Quartararo, she came from a close family and was the youngest of seven children. She often played supporting roles and sometimes a love interest for the lead male actor. In One Stolen Night (1928) Quartero was cast with Betty Bronson and William Collier. The story concerns a British World War I soldier who comes to the assistance of an enslaved dancer. In Frozen River (1929) she was paired with Raymond McKee as the motion picture's romantic leads.
In 1931 Quartero appeared in Arizona, an early John Wayne movie. Playing "Conchita," she is a source of strife in Wayne's relationship to the characters depicted by Laura La Plante and June Clyde. She performed again with Wayne in The Man from Monterey (1933). Her final screen performances show Quartero playing smaller parts, such as the role of a Cuban dancer in Torchy Blane in Panama (1938), a native dancer in Green Hell (1940) and a bar-girl in A Lady Takes a Chance (1943).
Death
Nina Quartero died in Woodland Hills, California in 1985, aged 78.
Publicity stunt
Quartero once tried a publicity stunt by claiming that she was betrothed to Notre Dame All-American quarterback Frank Carideo. Carideo demanded a retraction of Quartero's engagement announcement, although he admitted he knew her from a time when each resided in Mount Vernon, New York. He had also visited her home, in Beverly Hills, California, prior to the 1930 University of Southern California game, to exchange greetings.

Shengjing Times (), also known as Shengjing Shibao, usually abbreviated SJSB, was a Japanese-owned Chinese newspaper established in Fengtian on October 18, 1906 by Japanese journalist named Nakajima Masao (中島真雄). It received financial assistance from Japan's consulate-general in Fengtian during its early years.
Shengjing Times was the highest circulation Chinese language daily newspaper and the most important instrument of Japanese press influence in Manchuria. It is the first Chinese-language newspaper published by the Japanese in Northeast China, and it was also Japan's longest-published newspaper in China.
With a circulation comparable to that of Far Eastern Journal (远东报), the Shengjing Shibao'''s dominance of public opinion in the Northeast China remained unchallenged after the demise of Far Eastern Journal'' until the closing months of the World War II.

Geashill () is a village in County Offaly, Ireland. It is situated between the towns of Tullamore and Portarlington on the R420 regional road. Geashill has a Church of Ireland church, a shop and petrol station, a school, a GAA club, two public houses and a playground.
History
The name Geashill is an anglicisation of the Irish name Géisill. Older anglicisations include Geashil, Geshill, Geshell, Geisshell and Gessill.
Medieval Geashill
An ancient place named Brí Dam was situated in or near Geashill; it had its sacred tree () that was mentioned in Lives of Saint Patrick. In 600 AD, Brí Dam was the place of death of king of Uisnech (according to some sources - King of Ireland) Suibne mac Colmáin, who was killed near an unidentified stream.
An Anglo-Norman settlement was built here between 1185 and 1204 by the first Lord of Offaly, Gerald Fitzmaurice Fitzgerald, an ancestor of the Earls of Kildare. Originally of motte-and-bailey design, it was a timber castle on an earthen mound, nearby were located the church and tenant dwellings. In the 15th century the wooded fortress was replaced by a stone tower house. Today, only the west wall of the castle remains.
In 1598, Lettice Fitzgerald, daughter and heir of Gerald, the Lord Offaly of the time, married a Robert Digby of Coleshill, Warwickshire, who was a brother of The 1st Earl of Bristol and whose son was created The 1st Baron Digby, of Geashill in the King's County, in 1620.
19th century
The Digbys developed Geashill as a planned estate village. Samuel Lewis, writing in 1837, described the village as containing 87 mostly thatched houses arranged around a triangular green. Fairs were held on 1 May, 6 October and December, the latter being one of the largest pig markets in Ireland. Consisting of over , the Digby estate was the largest in County Offaly.
The 9th Baron Digby came into the estate in 1856, but had no money to keep it. Consequently, he evicted a large number of families from their lands. A local priest, Father Patrick Dunne, arranged for 400 people to be taken to Australia on a ship named the Erin-go-Bragh, which took a record 25 weeks to reach Moreton Bay; 51 passengers died en route. Following the evictions, Lord Digby carried out extensive improvements in the 1860s and 1870s and many of the current buildings around the triangular green date from this time. The Kings County Directory recorded that Digby had "converted the village of Geashill into what it now is, one of the neatest, cleanest and best kept in Ireland."
At the Paris Exhibition of 1867, Lord Digby was awarded the bronze medal for models of the village he was building. He was awarded the gold medal for three years by the Royal Agricultural Society, for improving the greatest number of cottages in the best manner in the Province of Leinster. The Digbys built a house called Geashill Castle near the medieval tower house, but this was burnt down during the Civil War in 1922.
Transport
Geashill railway station opened on 2 October 1854, was closed for passenger traffic on 17 June 1963 and finally closed altogether on 30 August 1982.
Sport
The local Gaelic Athletic Association club, Raheen GAA, won the Offaly Intermediate Football Championship in 1981 and 2014.

Judah ibn Balaam (or Bal'am) (Hebrew: יהודה בן שמואל אבן בלעם Yehuda ben Shmuel ibn Balaam; Arabic: Abu Zakariyya Yahya ibn Balaam) was an Andalusian rabbi of the eleventh century (Toledo, 1000 - Seville, 1070).
Biographical information
The life of Judah ibn Balaam is only known by a poem by Moses ibn Ezra in his Kitab al-Muḍaḍarah. It seems that this poem is itself based on the work of Judah, and not on other sources.
According to Ibn Ezra, "Ibn Bal'am came from a respected family in Toledo, and settled later in Seville. In his old age he devoted himself to the study of halakhah. He possessed a quick comprehension and an excellent memory. His style was direct and terse, so that he could present comprehensive subjects in a few words. His literary work extended especially to compendious treatises, in which he availed himself of the thorough and comprehensive studies of his predecessors, but from which he extracted with care only their most essential and valuable contents. . . . Against his otherwise noble character and sedate nature his irritable temperament stood in marked contrast. Nobody escaped his criticism, which consisted not merely in the pointing out of faulty passages, but in a trenchant and ruthless analysis of their errors."
At the end of his life he devoted himself to the study of kabbalah.
Works
The works of Ibn Balaam are written in Arabic. Some are only known by quotations, by himself or by other authors. Some of the preserved works no longer exist in the original Arabic, but through Hebrew translations.
A contemporary and rival of Moses ibn Gikatilla, he is better known in his time for his works of halakha than for those of biblical exegesis and grammar. According to Ibn Ezra, Judah ibn Balaam thoroughly analyzed the studies of his predecessors, but carefully selected only the most valuable and essential elements.
Halacha
He wrote two treatises on halacha, Sefer Hatsimud (Book of the Union) and Sefer Hahakhra'a (Book of Decision).
Biblical Exegesis
He also wrote commentaries on most Tanakh books in Arabic. From Kitab al-Tarjiḥ, exegesis on the Pentateuch, only the comments on the Books of Numbers and Deuteronomy have been preserved. He also wrote the Nuqat al-Miqra, a short biblical commentary, preserved in its quasi-entirety. The commentary on the Book of Isaiah was edited by Joseph Derenbourg and, more recently, translated and edited, along with the comments of other books, by Bar Ilan University. A book called Ta'did Mu'jizat al-Taurat wal-Nubuwwat, which lists the miracles in the Pentateuch and the prophetic books, is only known by a mention of Moshe ibn Ezra.
He adopts an intermediate attitude between that of Saadia Gaon and Abraham ibn Ezra, whom he greatly influenced. He examines the text with grammatical tools, but refuses to draw conclusions if they go against the teachings of the Sages.
Hebrew Grammar
In his works, Ibn Balaam is strongly influenced by Jonah ibn Janah, to the point of being regarded by some as an imitator of him without any originality. His works include:
Ta'lif fi al-Mutabiq wal-Mujanis, also called Kitāb al-Tajnīs (in Hebrew, Sefer HaTagnis), on homonyms in the Hebrew Bible. The Arabic original has not been preserved, except for a fragment.
Kitāb Hurūf al-Ma'ānī (in Hebrew, Otiyyot ha-'Inyanim), on the particles in the Hebrew Bible. Fragments of the Arabic original were included in the annotations to the Kitab al-Uṣul of Yona ibn Jannah, edited by Neubauer.
Kitāb al-Af'āl al-Mushtaqqah min-al-Asmā' (in Hebrew, Ha-Pe'alim Shehem mi-Gizrat ha-Shemot), on the denominational verbs in the Hebrew Bible. The book was edited by G. Polak, and reissued by B. Goldberg and Adelman.
Isaac ibn Barun also mentions a grammatical treaty, which has since been lost.
Other
Judah ibn Balaam authored the liturgical poem Bezikhri 'al mishkavi, recited by the Sephardic congregations during the Selihot and during the Days of Awe. He could also be the author of poems bearing Bala'am in acrostic.
A treaty on the rules and accents of the masses, the Hidayat al-Qari (in Hebrew, Horayat ha-Ḳore, Help to the reader), was generally attributed to him. However William Wickes, editor of the Arabic original, put this opinion in doubt. It has since been shown that the book was written by Aaron of Jerusalem, a grammarian earlier than Ibn Balaam by a century.

James Kirkwood (fl. 1698) was a Scottish teacher and grammarian.
Life
Kirkwood was born near Dunbar. In May 1674 he was acting as tutor ("governour") to Lord Bruce at Glasgow College, where he lodged for some time with Gilbert Burnet. In the same year he was offered by Sir Robert Milne of Barntoun, provost of Linlithgow, the mastership of the school there, and eventually accepted in 1675. After 15 years, he quarrelled with the magistrates, was dismissed, and litigation ensued. Kirkwood got the better of his employers, who were mulcted in damages to the extent of four thousand merks for forcibly ejecting him and his wife — a Dutch lady, Goletine van Beest — from their house, and throwing his books and papers and Mrs. Kirkwood's furniture into the street.
Kirkwood left Linlithgow and went, in March 1690, to Edinburgh, where he lived for a year without employment. He then started a school for gentlemen's sons. He states that he later refused the professorship of humanity in the University of St Andrews, a call to Duns, another call to be professor of Greek and Latin at Jamestown, Virginia, the mastership of the free school at Kimbolton, and of a free school in Ireland. He also states that he was invited to return to Linlithgow school.
Subsequently Kirkwood became, on the invitation of the Countess of Roxburgh, master of the school at Kelso. Here he was again involved in serious difficulties.
Kirkwood died before 1720, probably at Kelso.
Grammatical works
In John Penney's History of Linlithgowshire and George Chalmers's Life of Ruddiman, Kirkwood is spoken of as the leading grammarian of his day. At the suggestion of Lord Stair, president of the court of session, he was consulted by the commissioners for colleges and schools as to the best Latin grammar to be used in Scotland. He pointed out the defects of Despauter, and was requested to edit Despauter's grammar. In 1695 he produced Grammatica Despauteriana, cum nova novi generis Glossa: cui subjunguntur singula primæ Partis Exempla Vernacule Reddita. It was dedicated to the commissioners of schools and colleges, and secured the privy council's privilege for 19 years. A second edition appeared in 1700, a third in 1711, and a fourth in 1720, all published in Edinburgh. The book was superseded by Thomas Ruddiman's Rudiments (1714).
Kirkwood also wrote:
Grammatica facilis, seu nova et artificiosa methodus docendi Linguam Latinam: cui præfiguntur animadversiones in rudimenta nostra vulgaria, et Grammaticam Despauterianam ..., Glasgow, 1674.
Prima pars Grammaticæ in metrum redacta, Edinburgh, 1675.

Grammatica delineata secundum sententiam plurium ..., London, 1677.
Rhetoricæ Compendium; cui subjicitur de Analysi Tractatiuncula, Edinburgh, 1678.
Controversy
Kirkwood published an account of the Linlithgow litigation in A Short Information of the Plea betwixt the Town Council of Lithgow and Mr. James Kirkwood, Schoolmaster there, whereof a more full account may perhaps come out hereafter (1690). Among other charges brought against Kirkwood was that he was "a reviler of the gods of the people". "By gods", says Kirkwood, "they mean the twenty-seven members of the town council". Many years later he published The History of the Twenty Seven Gods of Linlithgow; Being an exact and true Account of a Famous Plea betwixt the Town-Council of the said Burgh, and Mr. Kirkwood, Schoolmaster there. Seria Mixta Jocis, Edinburgh, 1711. It was dedicated to Sir David Dalrymple, whose elder brother, the "Earl of Stair", says the author, "not only sent his son, the present earl, to my school at Lithgow, but tabled him in my house". The work contains details of the social and religious state of affairs during the contention for supremacy between the Presbyterian and Prelatic parties.
Kirkwood narrated his affairs at Kelso in Mr. Kirkwood's Plea before the Kirk, and Civil Judicatures of Scotland. Divided into Five Parts, London, printed by D. E. for the author, 1698, dedicated to the Countess of Roxburgh. Kirkwood made a crude attack on the character of the minister, Dr. Jaques, who replied in a Vindication against Master Kirkwood's Defamation. Kirkwood sent forth an Answer, without an imprint. Throughout his pamphleteering Kirkwood claimed high repute as a grammarian.

Thorvald John Marius Madsen (February 18, 1870 in Frederiksberg – April 14, 1957 in Gjorslev) was a Danish physician and bacteriologist. Madsen was the director of Statens Serum Institut from 1910 to 1940.
He was the son of General V. H. O. Madsen.
During World War I, Thorvald Madsen in his capacity as director of Statens Serum Institut was heavily involved in humanitarian work for prisoners of war. From 1916 onwards Madsen did several inspection visits to detention centers in Russia, where conditions were highly questionable. During these travels brought Thorvald Madsen, among other things excess serum against various diseases. In addition, Madsen helped more Danish-Schleswigers, who had been in German military service and ended up a prisoner of war. Thorvald Madsen was also involved in the work of selecting sick prisoners of war who were sent to Denmark as part of the conditions of prisoner exchanges between, on the one hand, Austria-Hungary and Germany on the other hand, Russia.
In the years 1921-1937 was Thorvald Madsen, president of the League of Nations Health Committee. The current WHO relies heavily on the Health Commission's work.
Madsen was Knight of the Dannebrog in 1902, Dannebrogsmand 1918, the Commander of the 2nd degree in 1920, of 1 degree in 1927 and received the Grand Cross 1937.
He is buried in Garrison Cemetery.

Lake Rotoehu is the smallest in a chain of three lakes to the northeast of Lake Rotorua in New Zealand's North Island. It is located between the city of Rotorua and town of Whakatane. The southern end of the lake occupies part of the Okataina caldera. It is fed (underground seepage) by Lake Rotoma to the east, and flows westward joining Lake Rotoiti.
The lake is one of the least visited, but offers great Kayaking and fishing (rainbow trout). It has two access points, Otautu Bay and Kennedy Bay and is well located centrally to many other places e.g. the ocean, mountain biking, hiking etc. It has very good wildlife and birdlife with several rarely seen birds. In particular the endangered Kokako is located close by.
The New Zealand Ministry for Culture and Heritage gives a translation of "turbid lake" for .

In 2020, he raced in the British Superbike Championship aboard a Ducati Panigale where he won his second British title, followed by a sixth finish in the 2021 championship. For 2022, Brookes remains with the same team, renamed as MCE Ducati.
Career
Early career
In 2004 he won the World Supersport round at Philip Island as a wild card, before a serious crash ruined his year. He returned to win Australia's Superbike and Supersport titles in 2005 on a Honda.
Supersport & Superbike World Championship
He then moved to World Supersport with a Caracchi Ducati for 2006, but left the team mid-season despite a 6th place at his home round. Brookes was soon racing again however, joining Bertocchi Kawasaki in the Superbike World Championship, debuting on the bike at the Italian round at Mugello. He ran 4th in a wet race in the Netherlands before falling, but generally struggled, as it was his first time living in Europe, mostly on circuits he did not know.
He did enough to be retained for 2007, with the team gaining new investors, a switch to Honda Fireblade bikes, and a new teammate in fellow Australian Karl Muggeridge. Despite 9 points finishes in the first 7 two-race rounds, the team missed round 8 after a legal challenge from Sergio Bertocchi.
Brookes joined the Stiggy Motorsport Honda team in the Supersport World Championship for the final 5 rounds. He continued with them in 2008. Brookes scored his second win (and Stiggy's first) at Donington Park, moving up to second in the championship. He also made a one-off appearance in the British Supersport Championship for HM Plant Honda, qualifying on pole and finishing third].
British Superbike Championship
For 2009, Brookes switches to British Superbikes with HM Plant Honda, alongside fellow Aussie Glen Richards, however he was forced to miss the opening round due to visa issues. Round 3 at Donington Park was also a disaster, as Brookes collided with Sylvain Guintoli on the sighting lap on the way to the grid, causing a broken leg for the Frenchman. Brookes claimed to have experienced a brake failure, if proven these allegations had left Honda liable: for this reason they neglected to give their support. He received a one-race suspended ban as a result. In the next meeting at Thruxton he took seventh and third, with some fighting overtaking moves in race two especially. He followed this with a front row start and two third places at Snetterton.
Brookes was involved in further controversy at Mallory Park. While running fourth he lost control of the bike, resulting in a crash with the leader Simon Andrews. The Honda's engine case broke, spilling oil on the track and causing five other riders to crash. All riders involved in the accident were omitted from the result, even those who deliberately downed the bikes to avoid further carnage, due to red flag regulations. Brookes apologised in a TV interview later in the programme for his mistake. He had sustained a broken thumb from the crash. The BSB officials awarded him a 2-race ban following the incident, for "not riding in a manner compatible with general safety". He finished 3rd on his return at Croft, defending from one-off teammate Ryuichi Kiyonari on the line.
Despite the bad blood felt towards Brookes, GSE Airwaves Yamaha boss, Colin Wright told a Eurosport TV interview at Brands Hatch that he would like to sign Brookes for 2010, if he were to lose one or both 2009 riders. As it turned out, GSE Yamaha would not return in 2010.
For 2010 Brookes stayed with the HM Plant Honda team, Brookes has changed to bike #4 and is also joined by former double British Superbike Champion Ryuichi Kiyonari. He took his first win in the fourth race of the season. He also took a win at Cadwell Park and two wins at Snetterton. His season was closely documented in the film I, Superbiker.
He also made a British Superstock entry in the MotoGP support round at Silverstone, and a World Superbike appearance substituting for injured countryman Broc Parkes at Phillip Island. Brookes will also make a wildcard entry with teammate Kiyonari at Silverstone.
For 2011 Brookes switched to the Relentless TAS Suzuki team joined by Alastair Seeley who is competing in British Supersport. He is a poor start to the season with a massive crash at Oulton Park which wrecked his bike. By mid-season he started to get good results.
During 2015 he raced a Milwaukee Yamaha YZF-R1, winning the British Superbike Championship at the final round of the season at Brands Hatch. In the last race of the event, Brookes hit the inside kerb of a bend and slid off, but had already amassed sufficient points to win the Championship in the first of three races at the venue, so he re-joined the track for a lap after the race to wave to spectators.
In 2017, Brookes finished second in the championship standings aboard a Yamaha. He won two races and scored four second places.
Isle of Man TT
On 28 November 2012, it was announced that Brookes would compete at the 2013 Isle of Man TT Races. As a high-profile 'newcomer' similar to Steve Plater, Brookes would compete for Tyco Suzuki in the Superbike, Superstock and Senior categories.
In the 2013 Superbike race, Brookes became the fastest-ever newcomer, with a lap of 127.726 mph (which stood until the 129 mph lap of Peter Hickman in 2014) and finished in 10th position. From his two other entries, he finished in 46th place and a DNF (did not finish).
Brookes had better results at the 2014 TT, with a 7th, 10th, 67th and DNF from his four classes entered.

Die Like a Dog: Fragments of Music, Life and Death of Albert Ayler is a live album by saxophonist Peter Brötzmann, trumpeter Toshinori Kondo, bassist William Parker, and drummer Hamid Drake. It was recorded in August 1993 at Townhall Charlottenburg in Berlin, and was released in 1994 by FMP. The group, which would go on to tour and make multiple recordings, became known as the Die Like a Dog Quartet.
The album pays tribute to saxophonist Albert Ayler, and some of the tracks feature short quotations from his music. Brötzmann reflected: "The idea of expressing my love of and admiration for Albert Ayler - both man and music - in a musical statement is not new. We both tried to do similar or almost identical things at the same point in time, each independently and without knowing anything about each other - each of us within his own culture."
In 2007, the album was reissued as part of the compilation Die Like a Dog Quartet: The Complete FMP Recordings."
Reception
In a review for AllMusic, Joslyn Lane wrote: "here... you get four musicians who, whenever they're playing, play with every ounce of their attention, passion, and ability. Add to this each musician's great ability on his respective instrument and you get music that is alternately moving, invigorating, and astonishing."
The authors of the Penguin Guide to Jazz Recordings awarded the album 3½ stars, calling it "a stark, harrowing meditation on the life and work of Albert Ayler." They commented: "it's fuming and intractable stuff, but its spiritual measure is palpable and the quartet plays with stunning commitment."
Critic Tom Hull described the album as "impressive, exhaustive work," and stated that "the ghost of Albert Ayler looms large." He remarked that, in comparison with Ayler's music, Die Like a Dog is "more mediated, so while it easily attains the intended levels of intensity and difficulty, its reconstructed Ayler is more knowing and expert."
Writing for All About Jazz, Clifford Allen commented: "Die Like a Dog'' shows the quartet rightly as a working and cooperative band, one with a shared European, American and Japanese heritage and a sensibility that crosses numerous creative isles with a few fell swoops."
Author Todd S. Jenkins called the album "an apt tribute to the free-jazz great who died like a dog in the East River," noting that it "acknowledges Ayler's music directly and in spirit."

Sir Robert Walter Carden, 1st Baronet (7 October 1801 – 19 January 1888) was a British banker and Conservative politician.
Carden was the son of James Carden and his wife Mary (née Walter), who was a daughter of John Walter, founder of The Times newspaper. In 1816, he took a commission in the 52nd (Oxfordshire) Regiment of Foot.
Later a successful banker, he was knighted in 1851. He served as Sheriff of London in 1850 and was elected Lord Mayor of London in 1857. He was elected to the House of Commons as one of two representatives for Gloucester in 1857, a seat he held until 1859. Carden was out of Parliament for more than twenty years, but returned in 1880 when he was elected Member of Parliament for Barnstaple, which he remained until 1885. Apart from his business and political career he also served as a Justice of the Peace for Surrey and Middlesex. In June 1887, aged 85, he was created a baronet, of Molesey in the County of Surrey.
Carden married Pamela Elizabeth Edith, daughter of William Smith Andrews, in 1827. They had three sons and seven daughters. She died in 1874. Carden survived her by fourteen years and died in January 1888, aged 86. He was succeeded in the baronetcy by his eldest son Frederick. Sir Robert Walter Carden is buried alongside his wife and two of his children at Kensal Green Cemetery.

Vulsini, also known as Volsini volcano, Vulsini Volcanic District, Vulsini Volcanic Complex and the Vulsinian District, is a circular region of intrusive igneous rock in Lazio, Italy, about to the north northwest of Rome, containing a cluster of calderas known to have been active in recent geologic and historical times. Potentially they still are active. The Vulsinian region is one of dozens of intrusive circular regions, smaller than the Vulsinian, arranged in a band from Campania through Lazio, called the Roman Comagmatic Province. A comagmatic province is a geologic area of the same type and age igneous rock deriving from the same crustal magma. The Roman region is post-collisional; that is, the intrusions were not a result of the lateral stresses that created Italy and raised the Apennines, but were subsequent to Italy's creation. The Volsinian is the northernmost region.
At relatively low altitude, the Vulsini calderas cover about and contain four Pleistocene-age depressions known as Bolsena, Latera, Vepe and Montefascione calderas. The latest activity occurred in 104 BC. The largest, the Bolsena caldera, which is roughly across, is filled with the waters of Lake Bolsena, which derive mainly from deep aquifers. Immediately to the northwest are the combined Latera and Vepe calderas, about by . Vepe, to the north of Lake Mezzano (a very small crater lake west of Lake Bolsena) is what is known as a nested caldera; it arose in the previously existing Latera Caldera. Italian routes SS74 and SS312 follow the rim from Valentano through Latera westward, turning off before Mezzano on the other side. In addition the small Montefiascone caldera, also nested, lies between Montefiascone on its eastern rim and the lake. Two islands in the lake, Bisentina and Martana, were formed from airfall tuffs in Pompeii-like eruptions. Dozens of other tuff cones dot the region, mainly on the eastern side of the complex.

The Revolt of the Angels () is a 1914 novel by Anatole France.
Plot
Revolt retells the classic Christian story of the war in heaven between angels led by the Archangel Michael against others led by Satan. The war ends with the defeat and casting to the earth of the latter. The plot emphasises themes of protagonists fighting a ruling hierarchy, and attempting to escape it, as well as "hiddenness, delusion, revolution, and epiphany...a literary exploration of existential choices in an apocalyptic context". It is written, says René Boylesve, with a "deft levity". Mutual antagonism between God and his angels is emphasised, which leads to disgruntlement and ultimately rebellion by the latter.
It tells the story of Arcade, the guardian angel of Maurice d'Esparvieu. Bored because Bishop d'Esparvieu is sinless, Arcade begins reading the bishop's books on theology and becomes an atheist. He moves to Paris, meets a woman, falls in love, and loses his virginity causing his wings to fall off, joins the revolutionary movement of fallen angels, and meets the Devil, who realizes that if he overthrew God, he would become just like God. Arcade realizes that replacing God with another is meaningless unless "in ourselves and in ourselves alone we attack and destroy Ialdabaoth." "Ialdabaoth", according to France, is God's secret name and means "the child who wanders".
Political influences
France's political leanings—he was a socialist—heavily influenced Revolt, leading the theme that successful revolutions must always create greater tyrannies than those they overthrew. The bitterness created by the revolt is reflected in the "biting and harsh" descriptions. Joe Loewenberg has described it as an "imaginative narrative...the ripest expression of Anatole France's urbane genius, [being] a masterpiece of criticism at once ironic and irenic".
Literary references
Essayist David Fuchs argues that much of Ernest Hemingway's early work suggests that he was probably aware of the book, even if he had not read it. F. Scott Fitzgerald references "Revolt of the Angels" in his early story Dancing with a Ghost. Fitzgerald also uses the book as a prop in his story "The Offshore Pirate"; the character Ardita is reading Revolt, herself looking, says Griffin, "conically angelic...reading a book about angels ". Fitzgerald draws attention to Revolt five times in the story; he argues that France's work is the more romantic of the two. Revolt has been compared with the work of George Santayana in its suggestion that religion is set back by its successes. Henry Miller mentions Revolt of the Angels in his novel Tropic of Capricorn.

Oundle International Festival (OIF) is an annual community arts festival and organ school held in Oundle, England.
Background
Oundle International Festival (OIF) was founded in 1985, with the training of young organists as its core component. The summer schools are centred upon a new organ, built by Frobenius of Denmark and installed in Oundle School Chapel. A concurrent festival programme for the general public is also a recurrent feature of the enterprise. Every July OIF runs workshops from an international team of organists, for up to 60 young organists, in the age ranges 14 to 24.
The Festival and Summer School at inception were part of, and supported by, Oundle School, but since 1995 OIF has been an independent company limited by guarantee, and a registered charity operating under the name Oundle Music Trust. It has a Management Committee of eight, which meets three times a year.
Festival
The festival committee promotes three activities:
Oundle for Organists – a year round training movement, promoting access to the organ, and supporting young organists (beginner to university level) in their musical development.
Oundle International Festival – a professional music festival held each July in Oundle and the surrounding area, attracting a growing audience from the local community, and further afield. The programme includes jazz, folk and world music alongside classical repertoire, and related programming in other art forms.
Oundle Music Trust Community & Education Programme – programme of concerts (including Music in Quiet Places), workshops and projects in the Oundle area, which aims to extend access to, and enjoyment of, music through participation.
Since 1994 a fundraising jazz & firework concert has been held on Oundle School playing fields, which has become the highlight of the year in the small market town of Oundle, attracting an audience of up to 5,000 from across the Midlands.
In 2007 the Festival undertook a community opera for the first time, with three performances of Tobias and the Angel by Jonathan Dove. It was very successful, with three choruses of local people (one comprising around 40 local primary schoolchildren), celebrated professional opera singers and a small orchestra of professional musicians. The performances took place in St Peter's parish church.
Education for young organists
Since July 2002 the Prospective Organ Scholars course has been separated from the main summer school in Oundle and now takes place in Cambridge and Oxford in alternate years. The students are accommodated in an Oxbridge College, and thus are given a real boost prior to their all-important organ scholarship examinations in September. They are required to direct, sing and accompany three Evensongs in different college chapels, with Compline on two evenings. Mornings and late evening are taken up with organ tuition and practice, with full access being given to college organs in Cambridge and Oxford

Optical gain is the most important requirement for the realization of a semiconductor laser because it describes the optical amplification in the semiconductor material. This optical gain is due to stimulated emission associated with light emission created by recombination of electrons and holes. While in other laser materials like in gas lasers or solid state lasers, the processes associated with optical gain are rather simple, in semiconductors this is a complex many-body problem of interacting photons, electrons, and holes. Accordingly, understanding these processes is a major objective as being a basic requirement for device optimization. This task can be solved by development of appropriate theoretical models to describe the semiconductor optical gain and by comparison of the predictions of these models with experimental results found.
Theory for optical gain in semiconductors
Since defining semiconductor's optical gain is an ambitious undertaking, it is useful to build the understanding by steps. The basic requirements can be defined without the major complications induced by the Coulomb interaction among electrons and holes. To explain the actual operation of semiconductor lasers, one must refine this analysis by systematically including the Coulomb-interaction effects.
Free-carrier picture
For a simple, qualitative understanding of optical gain and its spectral dependency, often so-called free-carrier models are used which is discussed considering the example of a bulk laser here. The term free carrier means that any interactions between the carriers are neglected. A free-carrier model provides the following expression for the spectral dependence
with the reduced-mass energy , the quasi-Fermi-distribution functions for the conduction-band and for the valence-band , respectively, and with given by:
with being the frequency, the dipole-matrix element, the reduced mass, the vacuum permittivity, and the refractive index.
Thus, the shape of the gain spectrum is determined by the density of states, proportional to , for bulk material and the quasi-Fermi-distribution functions. This expression gives a qualitative impression of the dependence of the gain spectra on the distribution functions. However, a comparison to experimental data shows immediately that this approach is not at all suited to give quantitative predictions on the exact gain values and the correct shape of the spectra. For that purpose, a microscopic model including many-body interactions is required. In recent years, the microscopic many-body model based on the semiconductor Bloch equations (SBE) has been very successful.
Microscopic many body gain model
The model is based on the SBE describing the dynamics of the microscopic polarizations between conduction and valence bands, the distribution functions , and the many-body correlations created by the interactions.
If only stationary gain spectra in the linear regime are of interest, one can neglect the time dependence of the distribution functions and , and simply express them by quasi-Fermi-distributions for a given carrier density and temperature. The microscopic polarizations are given by:
where is the renormalized transition energy between conduction and valence bands and is the renormalized Rabi frequency.
In contrast to the free-carrier description, this model contains contributions due to many-body Coulomb interactions such as and , and the collision term that describes the effect of the correlations which may be treated in different approximations. The easiest approach is to replace the collision term by a phenomenological relaxation rate (-approximation). However, though this approximation is often used, it leads to somewhat unphysical results like absorption below the semiconductor band gap. A more correct but also much more complex approach considers the collision term kinetically and thus contains in- and out-scattering rates for the microscopic polarizations. In this quantum kinetic approach, the calculations require only the basic input parameters (material band structure, geometrical structure, and temperature) and provide the semiconductor gain and refractive index spectra without further free parameters.
In detail, the above-mentioned equation of motion of the polarization is solved numerically by calculating the first two terms on the right hand side from the input parameters and by computing the collision contributions. Then, the equation of motion is numerically time-integrated and the microscopic polarizations are summed over to obtain the complex macroscopic polarization which then provides the gain and the refractive index spectra in semiconductor laser theory. It should be mentioned that present-day modeling assumes a perfect semiconductor structure in order to reduce the numerical effort. Disorder effects like composition variations or thickness fluctuations of the material are not microscopically considered but such imperfections often occur in real structures. Such contributions to inhomogeneous broadening may be included into the theory by convolution with a Gaussian broadening function for quantitative comparison with experimental data.
Experimental determination of the optical gain
The predictive quality of microscopic modeling can be verified or disproved by optical-gain measurements. If the design is approved, one may continue to laser production. If experiments exhibit unexpected gain features, one can refine the modeling by including systematically new effects. As more effects are included, the predictive power of the model increases. In general, a closed-loop design, where the modeling and experiment are replaced cyclically, has proven to be a very efficient method to find and develop new laser designs with desired performance.
Stripe-length method
Various experimental approaches can be used for the determination of the optical gain of semiconductor structures. For example, the optical stripe-length method is widely applied. This method uses a strong laser source for optical excitation of the sample under investigation. The laser beam is focused to a stripe (e.g., with a cylindrical lens) onto the sample such that the stripe covers the sample but extends to one of its edges. Then, the intensity of the amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) of the sample out of this edge is measured as a function of the stripe length . The gain can then be extracted from an appropriate fit of the data. The stripe-length method provides reasonable qualitative results for semiconductor samples which have not yet been processed towards electrically pumped laser structures. More quantitatively accurate results, however, are obtained with other methods that require completely processed laser structures that emit in the fundamental lateral mode only as, for example, the Hakki–Paoli method and the transmission method.
Hakki–Paoli method
For the Hakki–Paoli method, the semiconductor laser has to be operated below the laser threshold. Then, the spectrum of the emitted ASE is strongly governed by the Fabry–Pérot modes of the diode laser resonator. If the length of the device and the reflectivities of the facets are known, the gain can be evaluated from the maxima and the minima of the Fabry–Pérot peaks in the ASE spectrum. This requires, however, that the ASE data are recorded with a spectrometer of sufficient spectral resolution. Then, this method is rather easy and straightforward but it provides gain data only in the regime below the laser threshold while in many cases the gain above the laser threshold would also be of interest, in particular for a quantitative comparison to a theoretical model.
Transmission method
The transmission method requires a weak broadband light source that spectrally covers the region of interest for the gain spectra. This light source is transmitted through the device of interest and the ratio of the intensities after and before the laser device provides the gain spectra. For this method, the device should operate on the fundamental lateral mode and the occurrence of Fabry–Pérot modes should be suppressed by deposition of at least one antireflection coating on the output facet of the device. In comparison to the stripe-length method and the Hakki–Paoli method, the transmission method provides the most accurate gain data for the widest range of injection currents. The Hakki–Paoli method can be directly compared to calculations within the Semiconductor Bloch equations.
Comparison of theory and experiment
The figure shows sets of theoretical and experimental gain spectra for a (GaIn)(NAs)/GaAs quantum-well structure. For the experimental spectra, the injection current was varied while for the theoretical curves different carrier densities were considered. The theoretical spectra were convoluted with a Gaussian function with an inhomogeneous broadening of 19.7 meV. While for the data shown in the figure, the inhomogeneous broadening was adapted for optimum agreement with experiment, it may also unambiguously determine from low-density luminescence spectra of the material under study. Almost perfect quantitative agreement of theoretical and experimental gain spectra can be obtained considering that the device heats up slightly in the experiment at higher injection currents. Thus, the temperature is increased for the gain spectra at higher carrier densities. Note that apart from that, there were no free fitting parameters entering the theory. Accordingly, once the material parameters are known, the microscopic many-body model provides an accurate prediction of the optical gain spectra of any new semiconductor material as, for example, (GaIn)(NAs)/GaAs or Ga(NAsP)/Si.
