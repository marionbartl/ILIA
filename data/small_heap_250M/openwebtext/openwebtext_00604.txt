Update: In September — before all of the other revelations about Republican Senate candidate Roy Moore emerged — CNN reported that Moore had in 2005 argued that homosexuality should be illegal. On Tuesday, a spokesman for the candidate indicated that this was likely a position Moore still held.
Does Judge Moore think homosexuality should be illegal? "Probably," his spokesman just said on CNN. — Caitlin Huey-Burns (@CHueyBurns) December 12, 2017
If he does so, he's in the minority nationally — but a large minority. Our original post from September follows.
Calling Roy Moore controversial is underselling the point a bit.
The front-runner in next week's Senate runoff race in Alabama twice served as chief justice of that state's Supreme Court — and twice got in legal trouble in that office for putting his religious values before the law of the land. In 2003, he was removed from office for refusing to take down a statue of the Ten Commandments from the state Supreme Court building. Last year, he was suspended for refusing to uphold a federal mandate that same-sex marriages be recognized in the state.
Moore's position on homosexuality is probably fairly obvious given that second conflict, but on Thursday, CNN revealed that it at one point went much further. In 2005, Moore told journalist Bill Press that he thought that “homosexual conduct should be illegal.”
Twelve years later, that position seems somewhat hard to fathom. But at the time, it was a contentious issue that Gallup polling indicated had about as many adherents as those who felt that same-sex relations should be legal.
Since that point, Americans have continually come around to the latter view.
What's remarkable about that graph, though, is that, as of May this year, 23 percent of Americans still think that same-sex relationships should be illegal. Whether Moore is among them is not clear; his campaign didn't answer CNN's question on that subject. But given that one in five Americans think that such relationships should be illegal, it would not be surprising if Moore were still among them.
The General Social Survey, a national survey conducted every two years, has regularly asked Americans whether they think sexual relations between adults of the same sex are wrong. Since the 1970s, the percentage saying such relationships are always wrong has steadily declined.
That said, though, the 2016 survey found that three in 10 Democrats, more than a third of independents and more than half of Republicans said that such relationships are always wrong.
Among strong Republicans, a group of which Moore would almost certainly consider himself a member, seven in 10 said such relations were always wrong.
The trend over time is clear: More Americans are more likely to view same-sex relationships as not only legally sound but perfectly acceptable. That said, although the views Moore expressed in 2005 were much more common at that time than they are now, if he still holds those same views, he's far from the only one to do so.

The news station also reported allegations that Valle was charging several men in the crowd and taking off the lower part of her bikini.
Police said she laid naked on a table and poured ketchup on herself while dancing.
According to the report, Valle caused $420 in damage at the restaurant by breaking two tables and two glasses.

CANBERRA, Australia, Jan. 26 (UPI) -- Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott sparked national outrage on Monday when he awarded Prince Philip, Queen Elizabeth's 93-year-old husband, with an Australian knighthood.
"Prince Philip has been a great servant of Australia," Abbott said at a ceremony celebrating Australia Day, a national holiday. "I'm just really pleased that in his 90s, towards the end of a life of service and duty, we in this country are able to properly acknowledge what he's done for us."
Abbott, who was born in London, controversially reinstated knight and dame honors last March. The Order of Australia, the nation's top honor, is meant to recognize "extraordinary and pre-eminent achievement and merit in service to Australia or humanity at large."
But the decision to knight Prince Philip -- who once asked an Aboriginal businessman, "Do you still throw spears at each other?" -- prompted widespread criticism.

"Is it April Fool's Day?" read The Sydney Morning Herald's headline.
"Sending an Australian title to a royal who has more titles than the closing ceremony of the Oscars is politically indefensible," wrote The Australian's political editor, Dennis Shanahan.
Opposition Leader Bill Shorten described Prince Philip as "distinguished," but said Abbott was behind the times.
"I think that on Australia Day, where we're talking about Australia, Australian identity, the government's managed to find a British royal to give a medal to, a knighthood to," Shorten said. "I've just been at citizenship functions, local breakfasts -- some people there wondered whether it was an Australia Day hoax."
Abbott drew some support from his own party, including Defense Minister Kevin Andrews.
"It doesn't cost us anything to give him this award," Andrews said. "How else do we say, in a sense, thank you to someone who's given six decades of public service?"
Australian media outlets and social media users, however, seized on the opportunity to resurrect the gaffe-prone duke of Edinburgh's most infamous missteps.
In 1986, for example, he told a British student studying in China: "If you stay here much longer, you'll all be slitty-eyed."

Linux is such a wonderful kernel for many reasons, but I find its adaptability to be the tops. You can get an operating system based on the kernel running on such a broad range of hardware -- something Microsoft can only dream about with its venerable Windows.
Even though Linux can run on damn-near anything, it is beneficial for developers to have a reference platform to use for creating. Of course, they can always expand from that jumping point. Today, Canonical announces that the Dragonboard 410c hardware will be the reference platform for Ubuntu Core on ARM 64-bit.
"This will be the very first ARM-based 64-bit development board and SoC available for Ubuntu Core, offering makers and Internet of Things (IoT) innovators an affordable, powerful yet flexible development environment, which can scale from ARM-based servers to embedded solutions. This offering builds on the DragonBoard 410c positioning as a standardised development board for the ARM ecosystem under the umbrella of Linaro's open source 96Boards program", says Canonical.
The company further says, "the Dragonboard 410c is the size of a credit card; originally designed to galvanise and inspire IoT developers and innovators by providing a high performance, affordable platform to form the basis of a host of scalable IoT solutions. This 'democratisation' of the business of IoT is designed to breathe life into great 'things' ideas that otherwise, without the proper funding, or access to technology, may never come to fruition. The 'c' in 410c stands for 'community' -- giving developers the tools to work on prototypes without the cost, and provide a smooth path to commercialization through production ready off-the-shelf or custom system-on-modules based on the Snapdragon 410 processor".
This slideshow requires JavaScript.
This developer board features the quad-core Snapdragon 410 ARM processor, clocked at 1.2 Ghz and 1GB of LPDDR3 RAM. It also has 8GB eMMC for storage and 4 USB ports. Owners can utilize microSD cards for expanding storage and the HDMI interface for connecting to a display.
In addition to the upcoming (date to be determined) Ubuntu Core OS image, the Dragonboard 410c is also compatible with Android 5.1 and Windows 10 IoT, making this a very smart buy at only $75. If you want to buy this board in anticipation of Canonical's release, you can get it here.

Canine distemper virus (CDV) (Paramyxoviridae-Morbillivirus) is a worldwide spread virus causing a fatal systemic disease in a broad range of carnivore hosts. In this study we performed Bayesian inferences using 208 full-length hemagglutinin gene nucleotide sequences isolated in 16 countries during 37 years (1975–2011). The estimated time to the most recent common ancestor suggested that current CDV strains emerged in the United States in the 1880s. This ancestor diversified through time into two ancestral clades, the current America 1 lineage that recently spread to Asia, and other ancestral clade that diversified and spread worldwide to originate the remaining eight lineages characterized to date. The spreading of CDV was characterized by several migratory events with posterior local differentiation, and expansion of the virus host range. A significant genetic flow between domestic and wildlife hosts is displayed; being domestic hosts the main viral reservoirs worldwide. This study is an extensive and integrative description of spatio/temporal population dynamics of CDV lineages that provides a novel evolutionary paradigm about the origin and dissemination of the current strains of the virus.
Is the most dangerous country in the world the United States of America? According to a new poll from WIN and Gallup International, the U.S. represents the largest threat to world peace today.
In their annual End of Year poll, researchers for WIN and Gallup International surveyed more than 66,000 people across 65 nations and found that 24 percent of all respondents answered that the United States “is the greatest threat to peace in the world today.” Pakistan and China fell significantly behind the United States on the poll, with 8 and 6 percent, respectively. Afghanistan, Iran, Israel and North Korea all tied for fourth place with 4 percent.
Much of the animosity toward America comes from Muslim Middle Eastern and North African nations, all located in a region most likely to be affected by American military actions over the past decade. Forty-four percent of Pakistani respondents, for instance, voted America as the most dangerous nation, despite Pakistan's acceptance of U.S. foreign aid. The Chinese and Russians rated the United States as dangerous even more than Pakistanis did, at 54 and 49 percent, respectively.
However, a plurality of people polled in several officially American-allied nations also rated the United States as dangerous. Thirty-seven percent of Mexicans and 17 percent of Canadians view their neighboring country with suspicion on the world stage. A surprising 13 percent of American respondents rated their own nation the biggest threat to world peace as well.
While poll respondents seem anxious about the United States' role in world affairs, many of them would have no problems moving to America if they could. The United States topped WIN/Gallup's list of top countries people would move to with 9 percent of the vote. Canada and Australia came in second with 7 percent apiece, while 38 percent said they were happy exactly where they are.
Overall, responders seemed remarkably optimistic about their own futures, despite any misgivings about the United States. Nearly 50 percent of responders say that 2014 will be better than 2013, the first time since 1990 that people thought a better year was on the way.
“Despite an unstable economic situation, our happiness index is extremely high all over the world except in Europe,” Jean-Marc Leger, President of WIN/Gallup International Association, said in a statement. “Moreover people think that 2014 will be better than 2013. Optimism is back in the world.”

Tony Blair has called for a "proper ground war" against so-called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria.
The former British prime minister said it was not possible to defeat the group through air strikes alone.
He also admitted that the West had "underestimated" the problems in Iraq after the toppling of Saddam Hussein.
He refused to answer questions on the Chilcot report into the Iraq war - to be published next month - at the Centre on Religion and Geopolitics event.
But BBC Political Correspondent Iain Watson said he gave a strong steer on his likely response to any criticisms he is likely for face from Chilcot.
Mr Blair said: "We underestimated profoundly the forces that were at work in the region and that would take advantage of the change once you topple the regime.
"That's the lesson. The lesson is not actually complicated, the lesson is simple - it's that.
"It's that when you remove a dictator, out come these forces of destabilisation - whether al-Qeada on the Sunni side or Iran and its militia on the other side."

Tony Blair didn't utter the C word - he won't comment on the Chilcot inquiry into the Iraq war until the report is published on 6 July.
But at an event in central London organised by the Centre on Religion and Geopolitics - a think tank which he helped to set up - he made it clear he would be unapologetic for his role in taking Britain to war in 2003.

Turning to the threat posed by IS - also known as Isis and Daesh - he said it had to be tackled before it could make further inroads in Libya.
He said "proper ground war" was needed to defeat the group, which could include British troops in a support role.
"There is no way of defeating these people without defeating them on the ground. Air strikes are not going to defeat Isis, they have got to be tackled on the ground," he said at the event in Westminster.
That did not necessarily mean British troops doing the fighting, argued Mr Blair, who suggested "our forces could be in support".
Iraq war legacy
But to defeat IS militants "you are going to have to go and wage a proper ground war against them", he added.
He told the event the choice was not between a full-scale ground invasion force, which could govern the land after the fighting, and not making any intervention at all, arguing that smaller-scale deployments by the US were already making a difference.
"You have got to defeat these people on the ground. The armed forces of America, the UK, France, other major countries have both experience and capability so even if we are using them in support of local forces, you have just got to decide what our objective is.
"Is our objective to defeat this enemy? My answer to that is yes."
Asked whether the legacy of the Iraq war meant it was more difficult for a UK leader to deploy troops overseas, Mr Blair said: "You can describe it as a legacy or describe it as a fact that arises from the nature of the conflict."
He added: "We are not being honest with out public if we are saying it is possible to defeat these people without making the commitment to defeat them and to do what it takes to defeat them.
"In my view, defeating them is absolutely fundamental because if we don't defeat them they are going to come and attack us here. This is not someone else's fight, it is our fight as well."
SAN FRANCISCO – It was a historic night for Pac-12 men's basketball at the 2017 NBA Draft as a league-record and national-best 14 former standouts were selected, including six in the first round highlighted by the No. 1 overall selection and three lottery picks.
Over the last five NBA Drafts (2013-17), the Pac-12 has produced 42 picks overall and 23 first-round selections, totals that are second only to the ACC (52, 30).
WASHINGTON's Markelle Fultz was the No. 1 overall selection by the Philadelphia 76ers, joining UCLA's Bill Walton in 1974 and Lew Alcindor (Kareem Abdul-Jabbar) in 1969 as top picks from Conference members. Fultz is the first Husky to be taken first overall in the NBA Draft.
WASHINGTON became the first school and the Pac-12 became the first conference to have both No. 1 NBA and WNBA Draft picks as UW's Kelsey Plum was the first choice of the San Antonio Stars in April's WNBA Draft. UCLA's Abu Danladi was also the No. 1 selection in the 2017 MLS SuperDraft, making the Pac-12 the first league to have the top picks in those three drafts.
UCLA's Lonzo Ball, the 2017 Pac-12 Freshman of the Year, was chosen No. 2 by his hometown Los Angeles Lakers, marking the first time in league history and just the fourth time in the NBA Draft's 71-year history that the top two picks came from the same conference.
ARIZONA's Lauri Markkanen went No. 7 to the Chicago Bulls via a trade from the Minnesota Timberwolves. His selection marked the second straight season and the fourth time in the last 10 years that the Pac-12 had three players selected in the top 10.
The Indiana Pacers took UCLA's TJ Leaf at No. 18, UTAH's Kyle Kuzma went No. 27 to the Lakers via a trade from the Brooklyn Nets, and COLORADO's Derrick White was taken by the San Antonio Spurs at No. 29 to round out the league's six first rounders.
The Pac-12's six first-round selections were the second-most of any conference in the country and tied for the second-most in league history trailing only the 2008 Draft class.
Eight additional Pac-12 players were taken in the second round to raise the overall total to 14, equaling the most of any conference in this year's Draft and eclipsing the previous Pac-12 mark of 12 in 2008.
Five Pac-12 players were taken in a 10-pick span in the second round – CALIFORNIA's Ivan Rabb at No. 35, UCLA's Jonah Bolden at No. 36 and the OREGON trio of Jordan Bell, Tyler Dorsey and Dillon Brooks at Nos. 38, 41 and 45, respectively.
Ike Anigbogu became the 100th UCLA player selected in the modern Draft era, the most of any program in the nation, with the No. 47 pick to the Indiana Pacers. The Boston Celtics took a pair of Pac-12 players late in the second round – ARIZONA's Kadeem Allen at No. 53 and CALIFORNIA's Jabari Bird at No. 56.

This is a rush transcript. Copy may not be in its final form.
AMY GOODMAN: We turn now to a battle over the work of the late historian Howard Zinn, author of many books, including his classic, A People's History of the United States. The book sold over a million copies, is still used in high schools and colleges across the country.
Howard Zinn died at the age of 87 on January 27, 2010. Less than two weeks after Zinn's death, then-Indiana Governor Mitch Daniels sought the removal of Zinn's work from the schools of Indiana. The revelation was made last week by the Associated Press after it obtained Daniels' emails through a public records request.
In an email exchange with top Indiana education officials, Daniels wrote, quote, “This terrible anti-American academic has finally passed away.” After he described A People's History of the United States as a, quote, “truly execrable, anti-factual piece of disinformation that misstates American history on every page,” Governor Daniels asked, quote, “Can someone assure me that it is not in use anywhere in Indiana? If it is, how do we get rid of it before more young people are force-fed a totally false version of our history?'' Daniels asked.
Governor Daniels' comments have sparked outrage within the academic world, in part because he recently became the president of Purdue University, the second largest school in Indiana. On Friday, the American Historical Association issued a statement saying it, quote, “deplores the spirit and intent” of Daniels' emails. The association wrote, quote, “Attempts to single out particular texts for suppression from a school or university curriculum have no place in a democratic society.”
Former Governor Mitch Daniels, now head of Purdue, has defended his actions. In an email to the Associated Press, he wrote, quote, “We must not falsely teach American history in our schools. We have a law requiring state textbook oversight to guard against frauds like Zinn, and it was encouraging to find that no Hoosier school district had inflicted his book on its students,” he wrote.
Well, to talk more about this, we're joined by Anthony Arnove. He is the editor, with Howard Zinn, of Voices of a People's History of the United States, a critically acclaimed primary-source companion to Zinn's best-selling A People's History of the United States. His most recent book is Howard Zinn Speaks: Collected Speeches 1963 to 2009. Anthony Arnove attended public school in Indiana from '72 to 1987. His family lives in Bloomington, Indiana, where Anthony was raised.
Also still with us, Dr. Cornel West, professor at Union Theological Seminary.
We welcome you both to Democracy Now! So, Anthony, this email trail, did it surprise you when AP released it?
ANTHONY ARNOVE: It didn't surprise me at all. I mean, if you look at what Mitch Daniels has done in Indiana, it's been a consistent attack on teachers, consistent attack on unions. He really laid the basis for the model that Scott Walker has been trying to implement in Wisconsin, with an early executive order eliminating collective bargaining rights for union workers in the state, making Indiana the 23rd—I hate to use the expression of a right-to-work state; it's really a right to disenfranchise workers, rather than a right to work—but making Indiana the 23rd so-called right-to-work state, and consistently going after schools of education. There's a national attack, which Daniels is part of, to say that schools of education are polluting the minds of teacher educators. And right after he sent that email that you quoted, he went after a teacher training program that was taking place at Indiana University in Bloomington in July of 2010. And he claims, “Oh, I was only talking about the teaching of K-through-12 students. I didn't—I want to protect K-through-12 students.” He was actually going after a program that was about teacher training, in which people were reading Howard Zinn as part of understanding how to open up students to different perspectives on American history.
AMY GOODMAN: I want to go to Howard Zinn on Democracy Now! We spoke to him in May of 2009—we spoke to him a lot, but in May of 2009—this is the clip—when he was in New York to launch a new edition of A Young People's History of the United States. And I asked him to respond to a question he had frequently been asked about the book: Is it right to be so critical of the government's policies, of the traditional heroes of this country?
HOWARD ZINN: It's true that people have asked that question again and again. You know, should we tell kids that Columbus, whom they have been told was a great hero, that Columbus mutilated Indians and kidnapped them and killed them in pursuit of gold? Should we tell people that Theodore Roosevelt, who is held up as one of our great presidents, was really a warmonger who loved military exploits and who congratulated an American general who committed a massacre in the Philippines? Should we tell young people that?
And I think the answer is: We should be honest with young people; we should not deceive them. We should be honest about the history of our country. And we should be not only taking down the traditional heroes like Andrew Jackson and Theodore Roosevelt, but we should be giving young people an alternate set of heroes.
AMY GOODMAN: The late historian Howard Zinn. Anthony Arnove, where does this go from here? Because Governor Mitch Daniels is now the president of Purdue University.
ANTHONY ARNOVE: Yeah, and, in fact, just a couple days ago, the board of trustees at Purdue gave him a $58,000 pay bonus after only six months in office. Yes.
CORNEL WEST: Wow!
ANTHONY ARNOVE: On top of his $410,000 salary. So he's being backed up by the board, which he, as governor, had helped put in by appointing them as trustees. There's now been a pushback. Faculty at Purdue University are organizing. A number of teachers' unions and National Education Associations are putting pressure on Daniels. But he is very much asserting—you know, holding to his position and escalating his rhetoric around Howard's work. So I think this really is going to continue to be a fight.
AMY GOODMAN: And is it limited to Howard Zinn?
ANTHONY ARNOVE: Well, it's not limited to Howard Zinn. In fact, there's a broader attack on critical education studies. James Loewen has written a piece in which he pointed out that when he wrote a book about “sundown towns” and highlighted the case of Greensburg, Indiana, which is where Honda built a non-union auto factory recently in the state of Indiana with a huge subsidy organized by Mitch Daniels, that he was supposed to give three talks organized by the Indiana Civil Rights Commission. Those talks were canceled under pressure by Governor Daniels' office. So, it's a very politicized situation. And they're aware that there's a certain kind of history which is dangerous to people like Mitch Daniels. If you teach a history that is about the history of social movements, about the history of people challenging those in power, about the importance of unions, about the importance of civil rights struggles, that threatens the agenda of Mitch Daniels as governor, as president of the university, and as someone with national political aspirations.
AMY GOODMAN: Professor Cornel West, we just have 30 seconds. Your response? You knew Howard Zinn well. You, too, are a professor who writes many critical books, critical of U.S. policy, domestic and foreign.
CORNEL WEST: Well, I want to salute the work of my dear brother here, and I was blessed to write the introduction to Howard Zinn's writings on race. But the important thing to keep in mind is that it's a compliment to Howard Zinn, because it shows the power of his work. And it's Howard Zinn today; it's Ira Katznelson, Eric Foner, David Brion Davis, Barbara Fields, Robin Kelley tomorrow. It's part of a larger discourse that says, “Let's tell the truth about the American past and present, and let's do it in such a way that it relates to everyday people, especially the young people coming along.” And, oh, we've got a lot of hope among the young folk. They're tired of all this hypocrisy, mendacity and criminality.
AMY GOODMAN: Well, we're going to have to leave it there. I want to thank Professor Cornel West and Anthony Arnove, editor and collaborator with Howard Zinn.
After her latest failed date, Youmu had decided to get help, and who better to help her weight problem than a weight doctor.
The news she would receive, though, would only continue her woes.
"I... Have a what?" Youmu asked.
"You have... a rare condition. Very rare, I thought it was only a legend, yet here it is. You have... How do I explain..." The doctor pondered. Youmu gulped, suddenly feeling very worried.
"I-it can't be that bad right? I-I mean people with rare conditions always tend to live meaningful lives..."
"That might be, but... This one is a lot more... Immobilizing." The doctor began, "it's called inanis stomachum, or 'phantom stomach.' In a way, you have two stomachs: your normal one, and an insatiable 'phantom' stomach. Some say it's a very literal version of eating for two... except- You see, because this phantom stomach is always empty, your body assumes that you are starving, and thus stores as much body fat as it can, making it very difficult and even impossible to work off. This 'starvation' also leads to increased need for high-calorie food so that some food IS turned into energy, and a vastly increased appetite, exacerbating your weight gain even further- "
Youmu paled, even more so than normal. "What do you mean...? You mean... I'm going to keep getting fat, no matter what...?"
The doctor nodded. "I'm afraid so, miss. I'm sorry, I know this is a lot to take in...."
The young woman was absolutely devastated. She's already a blimp as it was, but to think that she would get even bigger, with no possible end, was too much. She was crying.
"I-I'm... I'll never... Find anyone... I'll never succeed, because... because I'm a fat ugly blimp..."
"Miss... If I may interject, in spite of your condition, I do believe you'll succeed, you seem like a smart girl. Besides, I'm sure you'll find someone who will appreciate your character." The doctor adjusted his glasses.
"You... Think so...?" She looked up, the doctor nodded in return. "Okay... Thank you doctor... I guess, I'll just try to cope..." She would do her best to cope, she told herself.
--
Of course, that meeting was two months ago. With an appetite of her size, Youmu would only get bigger and bigger.
At present day, Youmu weighed over eight hundred pounds, edging on nine hundreds. Yet the girl would not give up.
After succeeding in the momentous task that was getting out of bed, Youmu had breakfast. It was a breakfast big enough for a family of ten- scrambled eggs, french toast, pancakes. She ate it all with gusto- but of course, she was still hungry...
"Ah... Good..." Youmu said to no one in particular. "Time for class..." She slowly got up, and headed to English class.
She promised herself she'd do her best no matter what, but it was in no means easy. Her stomach was wide, and hung down to her knees. Her legs constantly rubbed against each other, each leg as round as a tire. Her rear was was equally large, rising a few feet off the ground- so large she had to fashion panties from her old, smaller ones. Her once modest breasts ballooned into two large orbs rivaling the largest watermelons. And with every passing day she'd only get bigger.
With her size, it wasn't easy. She was very slow to get around, meaning she had to leave early, and she took up a lot of room- she easily took up most the room of a school hallway. Everyone walked around her in an attempt to avoid her, almost a sign of courtesy for the girl's behemoth size.
After ten minutes of lumbering, Youmu had finally arrived at her classroom- it took place within an auditorium- and she was several minutes early too. Feeling victorious, she entered; but alas, it wouldn't be that easy.
"Oh... What now... I'm stuck." She observed, disappointed. "I fit last week..." She was greatly wedged in, and it wouldn't be an easy task to get out.
She sighed, "And today was going to be a good day, too..."

Washington (CNN) Sen. John McCain's brain cancer is "very, very serious," the Arizona Republican said in an interview Sunday night, adding that doctors told him "it's a very poor prognosis."
"So I just said, 'I understand. Now we're going to do what we can, get the best doctors we can find and do the best we can. And at the same time, celebrate with gratitude a life well-lived,'" he said on CBS's "60 Minutes."
He recalled how he went back to Washington, against his doctors' requests because it was only 11 days after his brain surgery, to vote on health care.
"I got very choked up," McCain said, recalling the standing ovation he got on the Senate floor. "And then, of course, you know, all of them coming over and giving me a hug. It was deeply moving, I had never seen anything like that."
During the interview, McCain was asked whether his "no" vote on the Senate's health care bill over the summer was to get back at President Donald Trump for saying he wasn't a war hero during the campaign.

"If I took offense at everybody who has said something about me, or disparaged me or something like that -- life is too short," McCain responded. "You've got to move on. And on an issue of this importance to the nation, for me to worry about a personal relationship, then I'm not doing my job."
And on Trump, McCain refused to say whether he believed he was unfit to be President, instead saying that he trusts the American people for voting for him.
"First of all, I believe in our system. The American people selected Donald Trump to be President of the United States. We have to respect that," McCain said. "Second of all, he has a very strong national security team around him who I know has significant influence over him."
When asked whether Trump ever apologized for saying he wasn't a war hero, McCain said no. He also emphasized he and Trump are from different backgrounds.
"I'd be glad to converse with him. But I also understand that we're very different people. Different upbringing. Different life experiences," McCain said. "He is in the business of making money and he has been successful both in television and Miss America and others. I was raised in a military family. I was raised in the concept and belief that duty, honor, country is the lodestar for the behavior that we have to exhibit every single day."
This past year has been big for nuclear fusion. First there was the announcement from Lockheed Martin claiming they could have a fusion reactor that fits in a truck. Next there is an announcement from Germany that physicists are close to finishing another fusion reactor.
I suspect that when most people read about nuclear fusion, like in this recent TIME feature on a startup called General Fusion, they just focus on the "nuclear" part. But there is a big difference between nuclear fission and nuclear fusion. Let's go over the similarities and differences.
It's All About Mass and Energy
Suppose that I had a 2 million dollars (this is clearly just a hypothetical situation). For some reason I decide to split this money two separate accounts. After doing this, I find that each account has $999,999. Yes, I am missing 2 dollars! But maybe in exchange for this missing 2 dollars, I get a whole bunch of energy. That might be ok.
This is exactly what happens with nuclear fission (fission means to break apart). If you looked at an atom, you would find it has three things: electrons, protons, and neutrons (OK, hydrogen doesn't have any neutrons). The number of protons in the nucleus tells you what element the atom is (nitrogen has 7 protons, silver has 47 protons). Then there is the atomic number atomic mass number. This tells you how many protons plus neutrons the atom has. Uranium-235 has 92 protons (because it's uranium) and 143 neutrons (because 235 - 92 = 143). Oh, one more fact for the next time you are at a party. If two atoms have the same number of protons, but different numbers of neutrons—these are isotopes (like hydrogen-1 and hydrogen-2).
But back to fission. Here is the crazy part. If you break uranium-235 into two pieces, you get krypton-92, barium-141 plus two extra neutrons. OK, that isn't crazy since all the protons and neutrons are accounted for. If you find the mass of the original uranium and the mass of all the pieces, you will find that you are missing some mass. The stuff before has a greater mass than the stuff after. That's a little crazy. It's like spitting 2 million dollars and ending up 2 dollars short. But that energy isn't really lost—it was just converted into other forms of energy. Yes, we can consider mass to be a kind of energy. This is where that famous equation comes into play.
In this expression, E is the equivalent energy, m is the mass of the particle and c is a constant that happens to be the speed of light (with a value of 2.99 x 108 m/s). Because this proportionality constant is so large (and squared), a small amount of mass can give you a HUGE amount of energy. What can you do with all of this energy you get from the change in mass? Obviously, you can heat up water and make steam. Yes, that's usually what these reactors do—they make steam to turn a turbine to generate electricity. Just like a coal burning power plant, but without the coal.
The above example looked at mass changes when you break something apart. This can also happen when you combine hydrogen and deuterium (which is just hydrogen with an extra neutron). When combining low mass elements, the product has less mass than the starting stuff and you also get energy. So, breaking large atoms gives energy (nuclear fission) and combining small atoms also gives energy (nuclear fusion).
Why Is Fission Better Than Fusion?
There are plenty of nuclear fission reactors that actually provide useful energy. As of now, there are zero useful fusion reactors. It turns out that nuclear fission isn't actually too difficult. If you take some uranium-235 and shoot a neutron at it, the uranium absorbs the neutron and becomes uranium-236. However, this uranium-236 is unstable and will break into pieces to give you nuclear fission. Even better, it also creates extra neutrons to break apart even more uranium. Oh, you can also do this with plutonium and thorium.
Fusion, on the other hand, is very difficult. Instead of shooting a neutron at an atom to start the process, you have to get two positively charged nuclei close enough together to get them to fuse. Without the electrons, atoms have a positive charge and repel. This means that you have to have super high atomic energies to get these things to have nuclear fusion. High energy particles are the problem. This is why fusion is difficult and fission is relatively simple (but still actually difficult).
Why Is Fusion Better Than Fission?
There are a couple of problems with fission reactors. First, the staring material. I think Marty McFly said it best in Back to the Future in regards to plutonium:
"Doc, you don't just walk into a store and-and buy plutonium! Did you rip that off?"
These starting materials aren't just laying around. In fact, if you went looking for some natural plutonium you wouldn't find any. The only way to get plutonium is to make it. The other problem with fission is the products. After this nuclear fission reaction, you have this left over stuff that can be both radioactive and chemically active. It's just nasty stuff that you have to deal with.
Nuclear fusion would solve both of these problems. It starts with simpler stuff—although deuterium isn't always so easy to find, you don't have to make it. After fusion, you get something like helium (or helium-3). Think of all the balloons you could blow up.

AWARD-WINNING Belfast tea-blending firm Suki is creating seven new jobs after a government-backed cash infusion to buy new kit to help boost its overseas sales.
The company, based at Twin Spires on Northumberland Street, is investing £250,000 towards the expansion, helped by £35,000 from Invest NI.
The new jobs - three of which are already in place - will mean an additional £127,000 in salaries.
Suki, which blends teas and herbal infusions, already sells to customers in Japan, Europe and Africa, but aims to grow its business in Britain, the Republic and other regions. "Our objective in making this substantial investment in the business is to increase our capacity, capability and flexibility to enable us to exploit opportunities for our existing and new products," said Suki's managing director Oscar Woolley, who founded the company in 2005 with business partner Anne Irwin. "The new equipment we've installed strengthens our blending activity and will also enable us to respond faster to market trends."
John Hood, Invest NI's director of food and tourism, said: "Our support is enabling this ambitious boutique tea blender to respond to continuing year-on-year growth in demand for its 45-strong portfolio of teas and infusions from customers particularly in catering outside Northern Ireland. "It currently sells over 80 per cent of its teas abroad and achieved 25 per cent growth in turnover last year."
Suki Teahouse, which currently employs 12 staff, began business at St George's Market in Belfast (it retains a stall there) and has since expanded to become a supplier to major retailers such as Dobbies, independent delis across the British Isles, and hotels including the Merchant in Belfast.
If you run an OpenStack cloud, attending the next Mid-Cycle Ops Meetup is a great way to swap best practices and give feedback to help shape the next release.
As the name suggests, the two-day Meetup takes place halfway through the development cycle for the upcoming Mitaka OpenStack release.
This time around, it will be held for the first time in Europe February 15 – 16, 2016 at The Landing in Manchester. Sponsors include Canonical, Codethink, Datacentred and Midokura.
Unlike previous editions, tickets are limited to 100 people. This time it offers mostly round table, working groups and discussion sessions, with only a small number of presentations. You still have time to influence the sessions, too – so check out the Etherpad. Suggestions so far include high-performance computing, containers and upgrade challenges.
Superuser talked to one of the organizers, Matt Jarvis head of cloud at Datacentred, about how the first European Mid-Cycle came about, what you can expect to get out of it and, yes, the weather!
This is the first European Mid-Cycle – what inspired you to organize it?
The community of operators around Europe has been building for the last couple of years and having spent a lot of time at conferences talking to other folks from around Europe, it seemed to me that there was now enough of a community to justify doing something European focused.
I'd also noticed that quite a few of the European operators weren't really participating as much at the Ops Meetups at the Summits, or on the operators list, so I really wanted to encourage more of them to get involved.
It's organized slightly differently than previous editions, what's the thinking behind that?
The way it's being organized happened pretty organically really. I put it out to the operators list to gauge interest and we got a lot of responses on the planning Etherpad. Then Tom Fifield from the OpenStack Foundation got in touch with me and we've worked from there.
I've got a team on the ground in Manchester and the city is very well connected in terms of travel links, so it made sense from the start to try and do something there. Tom's been guiding the session planning stuff, as he's an old hand at that side of things and I've been handling the logistical side…
What's the reaction been so far?
The reaction has been great so far, the initial list of interested parties covered pretty much all the large public and private operators, vendors and development organizations we know of in Europe, and the community in Europe is pretty well connected, so we've been reaching out to others who may not have known about it to try and make sure we really get inclusivity.
Tickets are going fast, and we're deliberately limited the numbers for this first event to 100 in order to manage the costs and logistics a bit more easily, so people need to book quickly to make sure you're not disappointed.
What do you hope operators will get out of this meetup?
As with all of the Operators meetups, this is an opportunity for operators to share experience, build relationships, and hopefully to have a voice in the development process. We're the people at the sharp end, and have an important role to play in feeding in our experiences and concerns.
The European landscape in OpenStack is also quite different from the U.S. landscape, there are many more public cloud providers for example due to concerns around data sovereignty, and I think European operators may well have a different voice to add to the discussion.
There's also opportunities emerging across Europe for collaboration, particularly in large scale scientific computing, and new features in OpenStack like federation should enable multiple cloud providers to work together to satisfy those requirements and compete with much bigger players.
What should visitors see in Manchester or surroundings?
Aside from being a fantastic 21st-century city full of great food, music and culture, Manchester has a rich and varied history.
It's known as the birthplace of the Industrial Revolution, and also has a rich history in computing, beginning with the worlds first stored program computer, the Manchester Baby, and continuing to this day with cutting-edge computer science research coming out of Manchester University.
If you're interested in any of that, then the Museum of Science and Industry (MOSI) is well worth a visit. We've also got two world-class soccer teams, with Manchester United's ground Old Trafford a short distance from the venue. Bring an umbrella though, it's also famous for raining a lot!
Tickets for the two-day event are £10.00 (around $15USD.) Please reserve ahead for the Mid-Ops Meetup, so the organizers can keep you properly fed and caffeinated for two full days. If you have any questions about the event, reach out to organizers on the Ops Mailing List.

Starting today, the Royal Bank of Scotland will become the first bank in the U.K. to impose a negative interest rate on depositors. The negative rate will apply only to corporate customers, including mutual fund managers and pension funds, holding deposits of certain foreign currencies including euros. This means that RBS—in which the U.K. government still maintains a majority ownership stake since its 2008 bailout—will actually charge these customers to “borrow” their deposits. A few weeks ago, RBS notified more than one million small-business customers that they could also be charged for deposits if the Bank of England lowered the target interest rate, which now stands at .25%, into negative territory. Experts are warning that the latest move by RBS would “set alarm bells ringing” among small businesses and ordinary customers. The stage is set for a glorious and long overdue old-fashioned bank run if the BOE ventures to push rates into negative territory.
Meanwhile in the eurozone, since the ECB rate cut the interest rate in March to minus 0.4%, banks have paid a total of about 2.64 billion euros to keep their funds on deposit at the eurozone's 19 central banks. With European central bankers threatening further rate cuts, private financial institutions are exploring the feasibility of circumventing the charges by converting central bank electronic deposit credits into cash and storing it in nonbank facilities. The German insurance company Munich Re is reportedly already storing tens of millions of euros at “a manageable cost,” and Commerzbank, Germany's second biggest lender, is considering a similar option.
Of course any significant movement to convert bank reserves into cash would undermine the goal of central-bank rate cutting, because the cost of holding bank reserves in cold hard cash would not respond to a change in interest rates, short circuiting central bank efforts to stimulate further bank lending. More significant, if the movement to convert deposits into cash spreads to the nonbank public, it would bring down the fractional-reserve banking system in short order. And herein lies the real reason why prominent establishment economists are now leading the charge in the War on Cash. By abolishing cash, they seek to lock everyone's money holdings into the fractional-reserve banking system and make the system completely run-proof for all time. This would preserve and strengthen the so-called “transmission mechanism” of monetary policy, whose central element is fractional-reserve bank lending, which creates new deposits out of thin air.
Not coincidentaly, Harvard and former IMF economist Kenneth Rogoff has just published a book a few days ago bearing the lurid title The Curse of Cash. The book garners effusive praise in back-cover endorsements from leading professional economists such as Ben Bernanke, Alan Blinder, and Michael Woodford. Rogoff reportedly calls for the abolition of all cash, not merely large-denomination notes. While admitting that cash has some advantages, Rogoff makes the sensational claim that the bulk of the $1.4 trillion of US currency in circulation is used to facilitate tax evasion and to finance illegal activities like human trafficking and terrorism. Oh yes—Rogoff also argues that a cashless economy would make monetary policy more efficient by preventing savers from hoarding cash whenever central bankers—advised by sage macroeconomists like Rogoff—decide that the “natural” or optimal rate of interest for the economy has become deeply negative.
Cash is a unambiguously a blessing to productive workers, savers, and entrepreneurs who wish to protect their hard earned money from the crazed theories and swindling schemes promoted by statists like Rogoff and the central bankers he advises.

Valeri Nichushkin said it was the National Hockey League or bust if he came to North America.
He's giving himself the opportunity to prove it.
Nichushkin told Semen Galkevich of rsport.ru that he's ready and willing to play in the NHL next season for whichever team picks him in the 2013 NHL Draft on June 30th in New Jersey.
“I had already decided that leave for the NHL,” said Nichushkin, who added both the Tampa Bay Lightning and Nashville Predators have expressed interest in drafting him. – “[Dynamo] calmly reacted to this. I was told that I could leave if I want. No legal problems there.”
Dynamo had acquired the 18-year-old from Traktor Chelyabinsk on May 1st.
According to Nichushkin, his contract with Dynamo “will terminate, and I'm going to be a free agent. I was lucky that I went to the club to make concessions. We agreed that they would let me go, but if across the ocean something goes wrong, I'm right back to them.”
Nichushkin told Future Considerations' Roman Soloviev prior to his trade to Dynamo that he planned to play out his contract with Traktor before jumping to North America and would not consider playing in either the Canadian Hockey League or American Hockey League.
The 6-foot-4, 196-pound power forward is fifth in Future Considerations' final ranking for the 2013 NHL Draft.
I know this is kind of old news, but I still see people going on about it. This is about @DeoTasDevil taking down RMFC (allegedly). — perpetual inadequacy (@GunRoar) July 21, 2017
It's very possible you've heard the assertion that Deo (DeoTasDevil) is responsible for the demise of Rocky Mountain Fur Con. There's been a lot of back and forth about it, and allegedly she's the main and even sole party responsible. Let's put aside the various instances of the fallout and just examine the sequence of events pertaining to Deo's participation.
In January 2017, Deo tweets “can't wait to punch these nazis.” She receives a reply from someone that they would be amused if she were shot in response to her purported action. Deo responds asking if this person was threatening to bring a gun to RMFC. Deo contacts RMFC security to inform them of a potential issue.
Let me be clear: I'm aware of no state that allows you to shoot someone for punching you, then crying self-defense. — Boozy Badger (@BoozyBadger) May 27, 2017
^ A lawyer's opinion.
In April, three months later, the C&D letter and SovCit business happens. RMFC reveals that the hotel and local police have been called numerous times to make various threats (before and after Deo's January tweet.) This concerns the hotel so much that they demand RMFC pay an additional $22,000 for increased police presence at the property. Shortly after the cost demand, RMFC announces they're shutting down. Elsewhere, Deo is accused of having made at least some of the calls to the hotel and police, if not having orchestrated the entire phone-based attack. Essentially, some group of people mass called the hotel of the venue to make bogus threats and fake safety/publicity concerns, which led to the hotel asking for extra funding to be provided for increased security (months after Deo's tweet.)
(Patch:) To update the April article that preceded the closing of RMFC – a clarification was recently added by request. Deo gave an accurate quote of emailing the con only. She didn't contact the hotel or police in Colorado. At the time it was written, there wasn't a group dedicated to blaming Deo, so that wasn't made entirely clear.
Fast forward a few months and Califur experiences the same problem. People begin calling the hotel– though this time regarding the content of one of the panels featured at Califur– making fabricated concerns and threats. The hotel demands a hefty fee for additional security. However, the individuals behind this attack are members of “Alt-furry”. They even discuss formulating a plan to attack AC in a similar fashion.
Who fucked over Califur?
Oh yeah it was those assholes organizing threatening calls inside their AltFurry Discord.
Evidence: pic.twitter.com/nFUa07q7ZE — Deo (@DeoTasDevil) June 27, 2017
Coincidentally, the people claiming that Deo orchestrated the attack on RMFC are also members of Alt-furry. This makes two conventions that have been attacked in this way with a third planned (though no word on whether or not AC was actually attacked has been given). Assuming we don't know the identities of who attacked RMFC, we do know that Alt-furry went after Califur. Both follow the same MO, yet we're told that Deo is guilty by the very people caught redhanded in the second and potentially-third attack.
This is an immediate red flag that the accusation against Deo is little more than deception. The more likely scenario is that members of the Alt-furry group executed both attacks and are attempting to use Deo as a scapegoat, following her sudden notoriety from her tweet being thrust into the public eye. If you add in various things that I've skipped over (RMFC's loss of tax exempt status, the owner's sex offense record, the poor handling of pseudo-nazi instigation)… it just doesn't add up that Deo managed to sink RMFC with a vague threat lacking credibility.
Perhaps you've heard a different account of the debacle surrounding RMFC, but regardless of what, there's no denying the suspicious actions from members of Alt-furry that undermine their claims.
Consider this: Your house is burglarized. Not long after, your neighbor's house is burglarized, but your neighbor manages to catch the burglar. You find out that the thief was planning to rob another home. When you ask, the thief claims that they weren't the one that robbed you. Would you believe it?

Sony filed for an interesting patent in 2010 that shows it has technology that resembles Nintendo's upcoming Wii U game console. Titled Position-Dependent Gaming 3-D controller, and Handheld as a Remote, the patent shows that the game company is at the very least interested in a controller or mobile device with a built-in display to be used as an input device for a console game.
The concept is similar to the Wii U, which was unveiled at E3 last year. The device shows objects onscreen and interacts with the objects on the television while acting as a controller. It suggests that the next-generation game consoles will embrace touchscreen tablets in a big way.
Below is a description of how the device is supposed to function:
Methods and systems for using a position of a mobile device with an integrated display as an input to a video game or other presentation are presented. Embodiments include rendering an avatar on a mobile device such that it appears to overlay a competing user in the real world. Using the mobile device's position, view direction, and the other user's mobile device position, an avatar (or vehicle, etc.) is depicted at an apparently inertially stabilized location of the other user's mobile device or body. Some embodiments may estimate the other user's head and body positions and angles and reflect them in the avatar's gestures.
The device is position-dependent, and the application only describes it as a “mobile device,” so it's difficult to know whether it's a handheld such as the PlayStation Vita or a separate game controller designed for a future console. Still, it's only a patent application, and Sony may only be covering their bases for future control possibilities.
It has been said in the past that the PlayStation Vita and PlayStation 3 combination can do what Nintendo's Wii U can do. Perhaps Sony was way ahead of us on that one.

Never again. Since the end of the second world war, Jews the world over have pledged that the Holocaust can never happen again.
The guns right lobby has perverted this pledge for their own use – to advocate against stricter gun safety laws. The NRA's Wayne LaPierre has argued that firearm registration in Germany in 1938 helped lead to the Holocaust. Charlton Heston rallied NRA members by connecting gun rights with the Holocaust by declaiming "first comes registration and then confiscation". At the NRA convention this past May, conservative media personality Glenn Beck likened New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg to a Nazi. And just in the last couple of weeks, former cop and pro-gun pundit Frank Borelli, speaking on NRA News, applauded sheriffs in Maryland who refused to enforce that state's recently adopted gun safety laws by distinguishing them from Nazi guards who followed orders in the death camps.
As a resident of Sandy Hook and the son and grandson of Holocaust survivors, I find the NRA's attempt to draw on the Nazis' annihilation of my ancestors to further their political and business objectives to be dishonest, offensive and callously calculated to scare Americans into fighting laws that will save lives.
My grandparents met on a train fleeing Poland. They fell in love and married; my mother was born in Riga in the Baltic states in 1942. To escape death from the Nazis in Riga, my grandmother took my mom to Moscow and placed her in a Catholic orphanage where she remained until after the war. My grandparents and mother lived because they were able to move between the shadows, remain a few steps ahead of the SS, and they received assistance from non-Jews, who risked their lives to help them. Their survival had nothing to do with a gun.
My grandparents and my mother immigrated to the United States when my mom was 18, and my grandmother learned that two of her brothers had survived and were living in Buffalo, New York. Although my grandfather had fought in the Israeli army, including during the war of independence, in all the years he lived in the United States, he never owned a firearm. My mother not only never owned a gun, but did not allow my brother or me to have BB guns or toy guns in the house. After seeing what happened in my town of Sandy Hook, she is now a staunch supporter of gun safety legislation.
Yes, that's right, a Holocaust survivor supporting background checks.
I am certain if my grandparents were alive today, they too would advocate for background checks and other common sense measures to reduce gun violence. They would not fear registration – the Manchin-Toomey proposal specifically prohibited it. They would point out that Maryland sheriffs enforcing gun safety laws are not the same as Nazi guards following orders to murder Jews. In fact, it is just the opposite, as the new laws in Maryland will save lives.
Unfortunately, the only similarity between Nazi Germany and Sandy Hook is that innocent children were executed. However, even that comparison is not fair. In Nazi Germany, the government-sponsored genocide resulted in the systematic murder of more than 6 million Jews. It is so different than anything related to the gun safety debate that the NRA's use of imagery from that dark era should be dismissed as fear-mongering rhetoric.
As Americans, we should not tolerate the politics of fear. Instead, we should focus on the fact that way too many children are dying. Shortly after 12/14, the date of the Sandy Hook mass shooting, Nobel Peace Prize recipient and Holocaust survivor Elie Wiesel wrote:
SINGAPORE - The Eurasians are one of the smallest ethnic groups in Singapore, but they have made many significant contributions to the country.
Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said this on Sunday (April 9), as he pointed out prominent Eurasians such as Singapore's second president Dr Benjamin Sheares; Justice Judith Prakash, the first woman appointed as Judge of Appeal; Mr E W Barker, the country's first law minister; and Olympic gold medallist Joseph Schooling.
Speaking at the Eurasian festival at Tampines Hub, Mr Lee said he is also very happy to see Eurasians doing well in many professions all over society, making a name for themselves.
There were about 8,000 Eurasians in Singapore before World War II, Mr Lee noted. The community has grown to nearly 17,000 now.
"We have many ethnic groups in Singapore. Eurasians are one of the smallest groups, but one which has made many contributions to Singapore," he said.
Later, Mr Lee toured exhibition booths where people played childhood games such as hopscotch and five stones, and painted Easter eggs.

The festival was organised by the Eurasian Association and People's Association.
Mr Lee also highlighted the work done by the Eurasian Association, which he said has been very active in rallying the community to serve one another.
The association provides help to students through scholarships, bursaries and mentorship programmes, he said.
Its family support services arm also helps many disadvantaged families and seniors, he added.
Mr Benett Theseira, president of the Eurasian Association, said Eurasians were the descendants of the first "global citizens" whose culture were a mix of East and West.
He hopes events like the festival will promote greater awareness of the Eurasian community here.
After taking on Ryan Murphy's show Glee, now the American Family Association's subgroup One Million Moms is going after a new show Murphy is producing, The New Normal. OMM blasts the show, a comedy about a gay couple and their surrogate, for “using public airwaves to continue to subject families to the decay of morals and values” and promoting content that is “harmful to our society” and “damaging to our culture.” They ask members to email NBC, threatening to contact the show's sponsors (even though it hasn't even aired yet) and asking NBC to “drop all plans to air the program” because it “features homosexuality in a positive light” and is “pushing sin directly into America's living rooms”:
NBC is using public airwaves to continue to subject families to the decay of morals and values, and the sanctity of marriage in attempting to redefine marriage. These things are harmful to our society, and this program is damaging to our culture.
OMM is prepared to contact any and all sponsors of this program if it is aired. It is proven this strategy works! It was not too long ago that NBC announced “The Playboy Club” was canceled after only three episodes because of lack of advertisers!
Millions of Americans strongly believe that marriage should be between one man and one woman. NBC's “The New Normal” is attempting to desensitize America and our children. It is the opposite of how families are designed and created. You cannot recreate the biological wheel.
…
As a mother and a member of OneMillionMoms.com, I am concerned about the proposed new NBC show called “The New Normal.” This program is degrading to families and damaging to our culture.
I am appalled that NBC network intends to air a show that features homosexuality in a positive light. I strongly encourage NBC to drop all plans to air the program “The New Normal.”
My family and I commit to contact sponsors that advertise during this program if your network follows through with this show.
I am also prepared to join thousands of other voices in urging advertisers to place it on their “do not advertise” list and consider pulling all ads from the NBC network in protest of pushing sin directly into America's living rooms.
I look forward to your response.
“Shameless” has been renewed for a seventh season.
The renewal, announced Tuesday by Showtime CEO David Nevins at the Television Critics Association press tour in Pasadena, Calif., comes just two days after the dramedy's Season 6 premiere.
All key cast members are expected to return for Season 7, according to Nevins.
The order, like previous seasons of “Shameless,” consists of 12 episodes. Season 7 will head into production sometime this year.
“Shameless” kicked off its sixth season this past Sunday with nearly 1.5 million viewers up against the Golden Globes on NBC. Last season, the dramedy averaged about 1.6 million viewers in “live plus same-day” estimates from Nielsen, making it the network's second most popular show behind “Homeland.”
Starring William H. Macy and Emmy Rossum, “Shameless” debuted in January 2011. The series revolves around the dysfunctional Gallagher family, headed by patriarch Frank Gallagher, played by Macy.
Also at TCA, it was announced that the fifth season of Matt LeBlanc's “Episodes” will likely be the final season of the series.

Dig New York's "hot cop" Miguel Pimentel? You won't be seeing tattooed officers in these parts anymore. View Full Caption Instagram/Getty Images
CHICAGO — Last week, the Internet went crazy over New York City Sheriff's deputy Miguel Pimentel's Instagram selfies that showed off his tattoos and muscles while out on the job in uniform. Despite clear public demand for more buff, tattooed officers, the Chicago Police Department issued a mandate on Monday that may be bad news for Pimentel fan's and CPD staff alike: Chicago police officers are no longer allowed to have visible tattoos.
The mandate, which takes effect Friday, says "tattoos and body brandings will not be visible while on duty or representing the Department, whether in uniform, conservative business attire, or casual dress."
Police blog Second City Cop did not seem thrilled about the change. The site posted a meme saying "56 shot - 12 fatally - over Memorial Day weekend. ... Change the uniform order."
"No tats - hello long sleeves and ties. All summer," the blog added.
Jen Sabella discusses the new policy:
And they're right: according to the uniform change memo, "members assigned to uniform duty with tattoos or body brandings on their arms or legs that are visible when wearing the short-sleeve shirt or shorts will wear the prescribed long-sleeve shirt and long pants with appropriate neck wear, regardless of season."
If clothing doesn't cover your tattoo, prepare to invest in some Band-Aids.

"Members with tattoos or body brandings on their hands, face, neck, or other area not covered by a long-sleeve shirt, long pants, or appropriate attire will cover them with a matching skin tone adhesive bandage or tattoo cover up tape."
The department has not publicly commented on what prompted the change in uniform policy.
Other updates to the uniform policy include discontinued use of knit caps and baseball caps, though a "trooper cap" (think Elmer Fudd) can be worn when temps fall below 40 degrees and a "nylon mesh (ventilated) cap" can be worn in the summer. Mustaches are still legit (this is Chicago, after all) as long as they're trimmed and beards are still not permitted.
Dig tattooed officers? You might want to follow Pimentel on Instagram. Or in Playgirl, if the magazine gets its wish.

Christina Romer is back with her monthly opinion piece at the NYT:
RECESSIONS after financial crises are long and severe, and the subsequent recoveries are protracted. That is the bold conclusion of “This Time Is Different,” the book by Carmen Reinhart and Kenneth Rogoff, and it has become conventional wisdom. Their title is meant to be ironic. “This time is different” is what policymakers always say before a bubble bursts. Yet each time, according to the authors, the results are fundamentally the same. But while there are strong patterns in the authors' mountains of data, this simple summary misses an important fact: There's dramatic variation in the aftermaths of crises, and much of it is caused by how policymakers respond. This history has important implications today.
Oh yes, how policymakers respond makes a whole world of difference. After all why, if not for responding to “disturbances”, do we have “policymakers”?
And the response to the ongoing crisis has been dismal. Yes, the big banks were saved, so you didn´t experience a “bank fallout” like the one in the early 1930´s, which was certainly an important factor behind the depth and breadth of the GD. But even then, as Chris Romer reminds us:
There was even huge variation within the United States during this period. The Friedman-Schwartz study found four distinct waves of banking panics in the early 1930s. After the first three, output plummeted. But after the last one, in early 1933, output skyrocketed, with industrial production rising nearly 60 percent from March to July. That time was very different.
In the post WWII period, this time around is unique in the sense that it was the only time aggregate nominal spending (NGDP) was allowed to turn negative. I say “allowed” because that most encompassing nominal aggregate is controllable by the Fed.
In a recent comment in Scott Sumner´s post, Luis Arroyo (responsible for the Spanish Blog Illusíon Monetaria) says:
Simply, I see that assets prices change at much more velocity than goods prices, and the influence goes from assets markets toward goods markets, and not the opposite.
To which SS responds:
We are closer than you think. I see the connection as follows: 1. Future expected monetary policy determines future expected NGDP. 2. Future expected NGDP determines future expected asset prices. 3. Future expected asset prices determines current asset prices. 4. Both future expected NGDP and current asset prices determine current NGDP, current AD. Point 4 is similar to your argument. And the biggest fall in NGDP since the Great Depression most certainly could cause a large fall in asset prices.
It could be interesting, in this context, to take a look at the big drop in stock prices (the largest proportional one day fall in history) and the impact it had on NGDP, if any.
The charts below put the 87-89 period side by side with the 07 – 09 period for ease of comparison.
Luis is correct about the speed with which asset prices can change, but as we can attest, nominal aggregate spending can change very quickly too! And that´s related, according to SS´s four points, to how quickly expectations of future monetary policy changes.
For example, in March 09 the Fed announced QE1. Asset (stock) prices immediately reversed, before the same move could be detected in NGDP, but consistent with a change in expectations of future MP.
In 1987 stock prices plunged (the reasons for that are still hotly debated), but note that NGDP kept growing, so future expected asset prices did not change much, inducing a reversal in current stock prices. We get the same “shape” in 2009, but we know, even in 2011, that there is much doubt about future expected NGDP, given that the Fed seems content in keeping the economy “crawling inside the hole”!

The Foreign Office is spluttering. Life was liberal and comfortable under David Miliband, but its new Secretary of State is a rough and unabashed global sales rep for UK plc. William Hague's demand, which he repeated last Friday, for ambassadors to turn themselves into trade envoys is a bit like asking Sir Humphrey Appleby to transform himself into Del Boy.
Diplomats and politicians are now supposed to spend the majority of their time hawking British business. In all meetings with foreign delegations, "they should always have a very clear list of the commercial priorities we are trying to achieve".
Meanwhile, Simon Foster, the man plucked by Lord Mandelson to run his Business ministry, has been parachuted into the FCO to enforce the policy and the Government is even openly talking about appointing businessmen as ambassadors. That must have gone down badly in a department where diplomats spend decades climbing the ladder towards heading a mission.
The air of ministerial desperation is understandable. As the UK shrinks its public sector, the Coalition is gambling that trade and foreign investment will grow to fill the gap in the economy. "We have to pay our way in the world," said the Prime Minister.
It is also time for Britain to abandon the idea that it still has significant diplomatic sway. Our sharply intelligent and linguistically able Foreign Office mandarins are not having much effect on shaping global policy. As one senior foreign diplomat said to me recently: "Britain must accept that its position in the G7 is merely an accident of history."
Why not then put the skills of our mandarins to work boosting our business interests? The approach may well work across large swaths of the globe, but in one very important country at least, the shift in policy has left the UK extremely vulnerable. By prioritising our commercial interests above all else, including human rights, the UK is storing up trouble for the future in China. Whether or not you feel sympathy for the victims of China's human rights abuses, and whether or not the UK has the power to alleviate any oppression, it is essential that human rights remains a central plank of our relationship with Beijing.
Simply in terms of realpolitik, it is clear that human rights is the only lever of power that the UK has left to pull. The move to abandon the emphasis on human rights reform is being greeted with glee in Beijing as a capitulation. In 2008, Britain gave up its position on Tibet too lightly, reclassifying the region as an integral part of China. Back then, the Foreign Secretary was asked what the UK had received in return – the answer was nothing. Britain still exports less to China than it does to Belgium.
The Chinese government is extremely sensitive to its image abroad, regularly sending missives to this newspaper, among others, to complain about what it sees as an unfair weight of reporting on human rights violations. China is also spending an astonishing £4.5 billion to improve the way it is seen abroad, investing in new television stations and foreign‑language newspapers that it hopes will better communicate Beijing's point of view. The Communist Party wants to be seen as serious and efficient, not as a bunch of thugs.
By abandoning the agenda on human rights in favour of trade, we are doing a messy deal that exposes the shallowness of British principles. When Mr Hague meets Chinese leaders, as he did last month, and discusses business deals rather than pressing them to reform their legal system, it leaves British businesses and individuals exposed. Let us not forget that a British citizen, Akmal Shaikh, was controversially executed in China at the beginning of the year, despite entreaties from Gordon Brown.
The US has also recently made the same mistake. Hillary Clinton told Beijing, in the wake of the financial crisis, that human rights were no longer a priority because the US needed China's help to reboot the world's economy. The price that Washington paid for its cravenness was to see an increasingly bold and assertive China go on to sink the Copenhagen talks on climate change and resist attempts to rebalance global trade flows.
The US has now readjusted the power balance, pegging China back by sailing the USS George Washington, an enormous aircraft carrier, into the Yellow Sea and opposing Beijing over delicate border disputes in the South China Sea. But the UK does not have an aircraft carrier at its disposal. We merely have our principles and the skills and gravitas of our Sir Humphreys in advancing our interests. In China, at least, we should let them get on with it.
Several days ago, former Olympic Silver medalist and UFC title challenger Sara McMann revealed that she had retained legal counsel and planned to approach the UFC with issues of ‘gender inequity' in the new Reebok uniform policy.
Apart from the general financial concerns that the majority of fighters share, McMann revealed that the deal presents a strong case for gender inequality. According to McMann, since the women's bantamweight division was only added approximately two years ago, the vast majority of female fighters would be herded into the lowest tier on the compensation scale.
"I feel like this is a really touchy subject just because if you look at the numbers and you look at the facts, there could be a strong case for gender inequity in the way this deal is presented," McMann said on The MMA Hour. "I think the UFC and Reebok would never want to be perceived as somebody who was treating an entire gender poorly."
The following day, the UFC released a statement defending their new policy.
"The new UFC Athlete Outfitting Policy (AOP) equally recognizes each athlete's tenure in UFC, as well as any bout appearances in the WEC and Strikeforce for the period those organizations were under the Zuffa, LLC ownership. Women fighters with limited bouts under the tenure model are treated the same as other experienced men or women new to UFC from other organizations not included in the tenure model. This new policy was designed to provide an equal opportunity for both men and women in each tenure tier. In addition, the champions and challengers, regardless of tenure, will be equally compensated under the AOP for their bouts, something few other sports can claim."
As was recently announced, fighters with 1-5 fights will make @2,500 per fight; 6-10 will make $5000; 11-15 fights gets $10,000; 16-20 fights equals $15,000. Champions make $40,000 per fight.
Here we are, the night before the crowning. I have been predicting that Bianca del Rio would take the crown since episode 3. I still agree with that prediction. However, I was convinced that Joslyn Fox would win Miss Congeniality since episode 5. While I think she deserves it and has campaigned well for the title, I predict that BenDeLaCreme will get Miss Congeniality since she has almost twice as many Twitter followers (28,000) as Joslyn (15,100), has been in 4th place since the Snatch Game, and because RuPaul opened up the voting right after DeLa's elimination. I could be wrong – people could vote based on who is actually the nicest instead of who is the most popular. (And I do think DeLa is nice, but it's not her trademark the way it is for Joslyn.)
In the hashtag race, #teambianca is beating #teamadore by a narrow margin. And Courtney Act is not really in the running. The pink bar shows their rankings after episode 12. The fervor appears to be dying down after Episode 13, although I did not run these numbers until Sunday, May 18th. Perhaps people know that Ru has made his decision and their voting has less of an impact.
I was curious to see how this episode would impact queens' twitter numbers since Ru reminisced about long lost friends such as ViVacious and Kelly Mantle. If you have been reading my blog (Thanks, Chad Michael) then you know that an elimination gives a queen a small spike in Twitter followers and then her growth rate decreases after subsequent episodes, likely due to less screen time. Digging deeper into the numbers, you will see that this episode does not do much to rekindle our love for past contenders. Each queen's relative increase in followers is paltry compared to other episodes.
Rankings
The rankings have held fairly steady since episode 9, but there was one change in the rankings after this episode. April Carrion and Gia Gunn are no longer tied for 8th place. April holds 8th place with 100 more followers than G-G-G-Gia.
Increase in Twitter Followers (#)
Bianca (4,300) and Adore (3,800) got the most new followers. Courtney Act is doing well (2,200), but is not in the same league as the other two finalists.
BenDeLaCreme (1,200), Joslyn Fox (1,000) and Milk (900) are still seeing good growth.
The rest of the queens are seeing less than 600 new followers.
Laganja has gained the fewest followers this episode (149). I predict that she will have a cult following within a couple of years. That prediction has nothing to do with numbers. Just a gut feeling that Mama Alyssa Edwards will give her some publicity guidance.
Increase in Twitter Followers (%)
Bianca del Rio (9%), Adore Delano (8%) and Joslyn Fox (7%) have the highest relative increase in Twitter followers this episode. Normally a 9% increase is fairly unimpressive, but there was nothing new in this episode and a chance of conversion is unlikely.
Laganja saw the smallest relative increase in followers (2%).
Kelly Mantle and Magnolia Crawford, the first queens to be eliminated, increased followers by 3%.

Teacher who sprayed Asian pupils with air freshener for smelling of curry is banned for two years
A teacher who sprayed Asian children smelling of curry with air freshener was banned from the classroom today.
Elizabeth Davies, 50, was struck off the teaching register for a minimum of two years for humiliated children aged between three and six in her primary school class.
She was found guilty today of a string of charges by a General Teaching Council for Wales (GCTW) panel sitting in Cardiff.
Angry: Mother Karen Andrew claims her son Cory, although not Asian, was sprayed with air freshener for smelling. She wants teacher Elizabeth Davies struck off
In a stinging rebuke, panel chairman Peter Williams said: ‘It is our view that Mrs Davies's behaviour strikes at the heart of what it is to be a teacher.'
He went on to describe it as a ‘complete disregard for the children's dignity which should be preserved at all times'.
He said it included an ‘insensitivity to the (children's) needs, in particular in relation to their intimate care'.
The panel heard how she would warn youngsters ‘there is a waft coming in from paradise' moments before targeting them with air freshener.
Mrs Davies, a nursery school teacher for 21 years, also directed class assistants who worked with her to do the same.
She was found guilty of leaving wet or soiled children unchanged and also prevented other support staff changing them.
Children were made to stand on newspaper in their soiled or wet condition until collected by their parents.
The GCTW panel ruled that guilt in all five offences together amounted to unacceptable professional conduct.
A claim that she would mutter ‘black b******s' as she sprayed children was not proven.
The veteran nursery school teacher was working at Hafod Primary School in Swansea at the time.
More than half the pupils at the inner-city school, where she earned £34,000 a year, are of Bangladeshi origin.
Hafod Primary School, Swansea, where Davies taught pupils aged three to six
She was sacked from her job at the school in April 2009 over ‘child protection concerns' having previously been suspended for 18 months.
A police investigation triggered by a series of complaints against her concluded without charges being brought.
The Cardiff hearing was told that Mrs Davies would use the air freshener in the morning after accusing Bangladeshi children of smelling of ‘onions or curry'.
She would then target a short, sharp squirt at an offending child's bottom.
She also instructed classroom assistants to prepare bowls of disinfectant so children could wash their hands before having snacks.
The hearing was told by one teaching assistant that she believed that Mrs Davies discriminated against children based on race.
Mrs Davies did not attend the two-day hearing but had contested the charges against her.
Peggy George, a retired union rep who defended her, said that she admitted using both air freshener and disinfectant, but not in the way described.
She went on to highlight Mrs Davies's previous good record and underline a series of glowing references from people in the teaching profession.
Hafod curate reverend Susan Knight also described her as a teacher that ‘everyone wanted to work with'.
The prohibition order served on the teacher today will operate for a minimum of two years before she is eligible for readmission to the teaching register.
In practice teachers almost never make such an application.
But the decision to only ban Mrs Davies for two years has been criticised by parents.
Karen Andrew, who claimed her seven-year-old son Cory, though he is not Bangladeshi, was sprayed for 'smelling', said she was 'very disappointed'.
'He knew what happened, he doesn't understand it properly but he can remember what she did and being upset by it,' Mrs Andrew told the Metro.
CTO Clive Brown announces new Oxford Nanopore sequencing and library prep devices during his keynote address to the company's user group conference
Stop the presses! Not something we call on a regular basis at FLG towers because, well, our work is largely digital. But when the latest news from Oxford Nanopore landed on our desks this afternoon, this old print journalism adage felt rather apt.
Yesterday, in his keynote address to the company's user group conference in London, CTO Clive Brown announced the development of a new smartphone-powered nanopore sequencer, whimsically (and very Britishly) named ‘SmidgION'.
“Even I can't believe they let me get away with that name,” chuckled Clive during his presentation.
With 256 channels per flow cell, SmidgION will be smaller than the company's existing MinION device, and is expected to come to market in 2017.
MinION has established itself as a versatile field device, and is set to make history later this year as the first device used to sequence DNA in space. With SmidgION Oxford Nanopore are continuing to appeal to the field researcher, with potential applications in monitoring disease outbreaks, and real-time species identification in the fight against wildlife crime.
Brown also revealed Project Zumbador, also in early development, a combined sample and library prep device that would deliver DNA captured on beads directly into the flow cell. Event attendee and one of our favourite genomics bloggers Keith Robison (Omics! Omics!) shared some images of the early prototype during his twitter coverage.
Note – Keith has now written his own coverage of the Oxford Nanopore announcements, including a photo diary in which he takes his personalised MinION device on a bike ride around London.
Interestingly, Brown also announced that Oxford Nanopore are no longer selling devices that contain the R7 nanopore. R7 has given way to R9, the company's name for a membrane protein derived from Escherichia coli. This development may help the company to side-step a recent legal challenge from Illumina, which claimed that the R7 pore infringed a patent license. Oxford Nanopore licensed the new pore from VIB in Belgium and University College London in March 2016.
Android 7.0 Nougat is rolling out to the Xperia Z5 and Xperia Z5 Premium, with the Xperia Z5 Compact expected to follow soon. The updated software, featuring build number 32.3.A.0.372, introduces multi-window support, a “more personal” home screen and improved battery life.
The update takes advantage of Nougat's Doze battery saving system, in addition to Sony's own STAMINA mode, to help manage battery levels, with Sony adding three new power saving settings designed to prioritize performance or standby times.
In the release notes, Sony also mentions a new selfie-timer button for the front-facing camera and Google Now integration into the Xperia launcher, in addition to an update to the messaging app which makes it easier to send videos, photos, audio to contacts
The update comes in at almost 1.3 GB, so best connect to Wi-Fi for the download. It's advised to charge your phone to at least 50 percent battery level before installation also.
The update is rolling out now, with the aforementioned Xperia Z5 Compact, as well as the Xperia Z3+ and Xperia Z4 Tablet, anticipated to be next in line for it. We'll let you know when we learn more.

Nov. 18, 2015, 2:13 PM GMT / Updated Nov. 19, 2015, 12:24 AM GMT By Mark Murray, Chuck Todd and Carrie Dann
First Read is a morning briefing from Meet the Press and the NBC Political Unit on the day's most important political stories and why they matter.
Obama unloads on GOP candidates opposing Syrian refugees
As the world remains transfixed on this morning's police raid in Paris, maybe the best political story played out last night in the Philippines, where President Obama blasted the politicians -- mostly Republicans -- who want to bar Syrian refugees from the United States. And some of the context here: Some Democrats (including Sens. Chuck Schumer and Joe Manchin) were talking yesterday about a pause on accepting Syrian refugees. "When candidates say we should not admit 3-year-old orphans, that's political posturing,” Obama said at a news conference, referring to New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie. “When individuals say we should have religious tests, and only Christians, proven Christians, should be allowed, that's offensive and contrary to American values," he added, referring to Jeb Bush and Ted Cruz. Obama went on to say, "I cannot think of a more potent recruitment tool for ISIL than some of the rhetoric coming out of here in the course of this debate. ISIL seeks to exploit the idea that there's war between Islam and the West, and when you start seeing individuals in position of responsibility suggesting Christians are more worthy of protection than Muslims are in a war-torn land that feeds the ISIL narrative. It's counterproductive. And it needs to stop.” He concluded with this: “These are the same folks who suggested they're so tough that just talk to Putin or staring down ISIL [will work] … but they're scared of widows and orphans… First they were worried the press was too tough on them in the debates, now they're worried about 3-year old orphans. That doesn't sound very tough to me." Ouch.
But is his problem here with GOP presidential candidates?
Or is it now fellow Democrats? Yet while Obama was criticizing Republicans last night, it's worth emphasizing that he was losing Democrats (Schumer, Manchin) on the issue of Syrian refugees. It certainly appears that the Obama White House -- and its PR shop -- was caught flat-footed here. Yet it's also worth noting that we now have some Republicans (John McCain, Michael Gerson) who are criticizing their own party for its reaction to the Syrian refugees.
More Obama: It's time for Russia to step up its involvement against ISIS
Obama made some other news during his press conference in the Philippines: He said Russia needed to step up its involvement against ISIS. “I've also welcomed Moscow going after ISIL. The problem has been in their initial military incursion into Syria, they have been more focused on propping up President Assad... If in fact he shifts his focus and the focus of his military, to what is the principle threat, which is ISIL, then that is what we want to see." More Obama: "We are going to wait and see whether Russia does end up paying more attention to ISIL targets. If it does so, that's something we welcome.”
Bush to deliver speech on U.S. military and national security
Turning to the 2016 race, Jeb Bush today gives a big military/defense speech at The Citadel in South Carolina at noon ET. According to excerpts of his address, Bush will begin by invoking the recent terrorist attacks in Paris. “This brutal savagery is a reminder of what is at stake in this election. We are choosing the leader of the free world. And if these attacks remind us of anything, it is that we are living in serious times that require serious leadership. The last seven years under President Obama have taught us that problems do not take care of themselves in the absence of American leadership.” He also will discuss his belief that U.S. military spending and size should be more robust. “I believe in the principle that the greater our superiority in military power, the less likely it is that we will have to assert that power, or be provoked into using it. Our best Presidents have called it peace through strength.”
Carson campaign performs damage control after adviser questions his foreign-policy knowledge
Speaking of foreign policy, the Ben Carson campaign had to perform some major damage control after one of his foreign-policy advisers, Duane Clarridge, questioned Carson's expertise on the subject in an interview with the New York Times. “Nobody has been able to sit down with him and have him get one iota of intelligent information about the Middle East,”Clarridge told the Times. He added that Carson needed weekly conference calls briefing him on foreign policy so “we can make him smart.” The Carson campaign later responded with this statement, per NBC's Shaquille Brewster: “Mr. Clarridge has incomplete knowledge of the daily, not weekly briefings, that Dr Carson receives on important national security matters from former military and state department officials. He is coming to the end of a long career of serving our country. Mr. Clarridge's input to Dr. Carson is appreciated but he is clearly not one of Dr. Carson's top advisors. For the New York Times to take advantage of an elderly gentleman and use him as their foil in this story is an affront to good journalistic practices.” Folks, read that last sentence again: As Jonathan Chait quips, the Carson campaign says the candidate ‘got tutelage from senile old man, because alternative explanation is worse.”
Carson campaign: Carson “has had more foreign exposure than any Republican candidate save Graham”
NBC's Hallie Jackson gets an additional statement from the Carson campaign: “Nobody likes a story like that, but I don't believe it will hurt us with voters, because a) the premise is false. Mr. Clarridge was over-sold to the NYT reporter as a Senior Advisor and that simply isn't true. Dr. Carson has had daily, DAILY foreign policy briefings for several months. The briefs are an amalgam of no less than five senior foreign policy advisers… Finally, Dr. Carson , who has lived abroad and worked in and/or visited 57 countries, has had more foreign exposure than any Republican candidate, save Sen. Graham. In 1976 and 1980, Gov. Reagan was panned and belittled for his lack of FP experience, with great frequency. At the end of his term, he was hailed for his enormous FP achievements.”
Kasich proposes new government agency to promote Judeo-Christian values
A dispatch from NBC's Leigh Ann Caldwell: “As part of a broad national security plan to defeat ISIS, Republican Presidential candidate John Kasich proposed creating a new government agency to push Judeo-Christian values around the world. The new agency, which he hasn't yet named, would promote a Jewish- and Christian-based belief system to four regions of the world: China, Iran, Russia and the Middle East. ‘We need to beam messages around the world' about the freedoms Americans enjoy, Kasich said in an interview with [NBC's Peter Alexander] Tuesday. "It means freedom, it means opportunity, it means respect for women, it means freedom to gather, it means so many things."
Take the Q-poll general-election numbers with a grain of salt
This morning, Quinnipiac has another poll showing Hillary trailing the GOP field in hypothetical general-election matchups -- this time in battleground Colorado. And it has her behind the Republican candidates by double digits (!!!). But as we've said in the past, take the Q numbers with a grain of salt: Either the GOP is poised for a historic blowout victory a year out from now, or something is consistently wrong with the Quinnipiac numbers. Most other polls aren't showing what Quinnipiac does.
Yet another '16 gubernatorial casualty
Jindal suspends his campaign: Finally, Bobby Jindal ended his presidential campaign last night. “Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal announced late Tuesday he would suspend his presidential campaign after failing to gain traction in the crowded Republican primary field. In a statement announcing his exit from the 2016 race, Jindal said running has ‘been an honor, but this is not my time,'” NBC's Andrew Rafferty writes. Despite all of the earlier GOP rhetoric and talk about how a Republican governor was likely to emerge in the 2016 race, just look at the record GOP governors have had so far:
Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker ended his campaign
So did former Texas Gov. Rick Perry
Ditto Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal
And former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, current New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, and current Ohio Gov. John Kasich haven't exactly set the world on fire.

The Speedhunters drift team was kept secret for so long that I never really got used to the idea. I was track-side at Rudskogen Raceway on the last day of the Gatebil festival when suddenly these three amazing drift cars came around the bend. It actually surprised me as I snapped away with my tongue hanging out. For the very first time Team Speedhunters drifted together and it was magnificent.
The team consisted of three current and former Formula Drift drivers: New Zealand's MadMike Whiddett, Ireland's Darren McNamara and Norway's own Fredric Aasbo. Who would have known these three guys from totally different backgrounds would one day form a team? On top of that, each of the boys has a very unique style when it comes to not only driving, but also building a drift car.
When the event was over and I decided to put these three creations together for a little visual assessment. I won't go into too many technical details as I will leave that to Sean and Dino who know a lot more than me. I just want to focus on the look and feel of these three cars.
Keep in mind these are not garage queens, so over the course of the weekend they had all taken quite a beating. They are far from perfect, but then again battle scars add to the character of a drift car.
I told the team to meet right on the middle of the straightaway. The problem was they all had to push their cars there because of the noise ordinance in place after the event was over.
The maturity level of these guys was very high as they are all professional race car drivers, but that did not stop them from initiating a push race. They are first and foremost professional competitors after all.
Darren brought out more manpower, so he quickly put a gap on the others.
After a few laughs and some close calls the cars were parked on the front straight of the two-mile course. Right off the bat we can see that in terms of height the MADBUL Rx-7 is the lowest (at least at the roofline), and D-Mac's AE86 had the most ground clearance.
Just look how mean that looks. I can't imagine what it would be like to see this in your rear view mirror.
The rear end of the Rx-7 shows some obvious battle scars and the rear bumper was knocked off countless times throughout the event.
The sound coming from the four-rotor is unlike anything I have ever heard. It is incredibly loud and it's no surprise that the team had to try on three separate occasions to quiet this bad-boy down before they were allowed do some full-course drifting.
I would go as far to say this is one of the best looking drift cars ever built.
The fact that it's gritty makes it even more appealing to me. It's used and abused and that is how a drift car should be.
Fredric's ZN6, known as the 86-X, was built in just four weeks. The thing that really gets me about this car is his personal style that is infused into the look and feel of the drift car. Just look at that front poke!
After four weeks of no sleep and hard work he went door to door on the track with Steffen, his former crew chief, and punted him off track. What a showman!
It sounds exactly like his previous Toyota Supra, as it uses the same motor. A few things are different of course, one of which is the hefty NASCAR transmission.
Ever since I laid eyes on the street version of this car I fell in love with the rear and the way the tail-lights sit. This is only the second ZN6 drift car that I have seen in person, and I cannot wait to see what other tuners come up with. If you look closely you can see a black strip of vinyl on the top of the tail-lights. That is a personal touch from MadMike as he was helping Fredric finish the car a few days before Gatebil.
Darren has come such a long way with his AE86 builds. I remember seeing him when he was driving his first Corolla with an SR20DET motor.
What really sets this car off are the taillights – or lack thereof. D-Mac put an LED strip in the rear for the brake lights. The functional license-plate rear radiator vent looks pretty cool too. It seems like Darren's theme is reducing as much weight as possible while putting more and more powerful motors in his Corolla. I can only imagine what is next.
That AE86 is incredibly lightweight and I am sure it would win in a drag race out of the three Speedhunters cars. I had a very hard time following it in the camera car, although it seemed like MadMike didn't suffer from the same problem.
The sun was starting to set at around 10pm so I decided to finish off my photo essay and get into more detail.
D-Mac's 86 has a huge, functional wing.
Whereas Fredric has only a tiny carbon fiber gurney flap-like extension on his boot-lid.
MadMike had installed a shower door on the back of his MADBUL. Which might I add is very sturdy, because I mounted an SLR camera body to it and it did not fall off.
Both D-Mac and Fredric's cars have rear radiator setups.
…which means both cars pass Sean's Gatebil car guidelines. This seems to be a very common modification across all styles of cars at Gatebil.
MadMike has one of the few cars that still retains a near original radiator position. Another rarity is the lack of a turbocharger, which is another of the Gatebil must-haves on Sean's list.
D-Mac's motor is half the size of MadMike's, but thanks to a turbocharged it is putting out around the same power. With the fabrication work exposed it you can help but drool over things like the turbo piping, rigid intercooler mounts and custom tubed front end.
Fredric's car is putting out the most power: around 650hp to the wheels. It is a complete transplant from the old Supra that he drove last year at Gatebil but some pretty major re-tweaks were performed to adapt the engine tot he new chassis. I was told that the 110 degree expansion elbow running off the compressor took a full day of fabrication alone to keep flow figures up in such a constrained area.
So we have two Toyotas and one Mazda. But one Toyota has a Mazda engine and the Mazda has essentially two of those engines put together. Then the other Toyota has the displacement of two-and-half of 13Bs. Did I lose you guys?
The MADBUL has more engine than it does bay, so to solve this problem the filters protrude through the hood. As it would turn out this was the source of most of the noise problems Mike had over the weekend.
Fredric's GT-86 has a near-stock hood, mostly because he didn't have time or available options to do much else. He was planning on cutting some vents in it but the team ran out of time before the event started.
D-Mac's hood has a hidden vent which I never noticed until this shoot. Function over form seems to be the theme for this car, note the rived-on flip up lamp covers which replace the factory buckets. Genius.
I love the interior styling of the Rx-7. It's very mechanical and calculated on the outside, resembling a machine of war. However, the interior has a nice ‘fun zone' where Mike puts all his stickers.
Fredric also has a fun zone on the 86-X but it is below the rear window, or right above the radiator duct, depending on how you view it.
You won't find a fun zone on D-Mac's AE86 as it is not really his style, all he cares about is all about cleanliness and functionality. To him performance is a fun zone unto itself.
The New Zealander painted his wheels, at least some of them, to match his livery…
…whereas the other two just left their rims how they came from the factory.
Before long I was no longer the only one comparing the cars. They were eventually overrun by these weirdos with a measuring tape. Is this a sign of what is yet to come of D-Mac's 86? Will a four-rotor fit in that tiny engine bay? Only time will tell.
Pretty soon the boys gathered up and decided that it was time for another push race, since D-Mac had an unfair advantage from all the manpower he had the first time around. I can't be sure but I'd guess there must have been at least six manpower to the body.
They gathered at the starting line and off they went.
Even down on power D-Mac still had a commanding lead as his car was the lightest.
MadMike was not far behind has he pumped those legs like pistons, or maybe cycled his feet like rotors. You decide.
Soon gravity took over and D-Mac was just along for the ride. But where was Fredric? He did have home advantage after all.
I looked back at the starting line and saw that Fredric's bumper had fallen off as soon as he started to push. Poor guy.
Eventually the track leveled out and D-Mac was dead in the water as Mike surfed his way to the lead.
Just as we thought it was over, Fredric and his crew rushed in from behind with front bumper in hand.
However it was not enough as the Rx-7 crossed the finish line. Yet another prestigious win for the Badbul at Rudskogen. Amazing.
I had a blast following these three lunatics around for the weekend. Although it does make me a bit sad to know that these three cars may never drift together again as they all live so incredibly far apart. I know one thing for sure: at least we will see Fredric's 86-X and D-Mac's AE86 in a few months at ProDrift and BDC. For now you guys can download some desktops of these three crazy drift machines.

Those damn Egyptians are so inconsiderate: first they non-coup just when John Kerry is busy honing his sailing skills. Now, the non-coupy country breaks out in civil war just as Obama is on vacation in Martha's Vineyard. Well, Egypt may be important enough to serve as a middleman when the US pays Lockheed Martin using Egypt as a dumb intermediary, but is obviously not important enough for Obama to cancel his vacation. Moments ago in an audio-only presentation (couldn't russle enough Martha's Vineyardians for the podium behind him? Were his sleeves rolled up? Was he reading from paper or a teleprompter? The people demand to know), Obama joined Kerry in "strongly condemning" the violence that according to some has already spilled over into all out civil war.
Some of the highlights:
OBAMA SAYS THE UNITED STATES STRONGLY CONDEMNS THE STEPS TAKEN BY EGYPT'S GOVERNMENT, CALLS FOR RIGHT TO PEACEFUL PROTEST
OBAMA SAYS STATE OF EMERGENCY IN EGYPT SHOULD BE LIFTED, PROCESS OF NATIONAL RECONCILIATION MUST BEGIN
OBAMA SAYS U.S. WANTS TO BE A PARTNER WITH EGYPT, IS GUIDED BY NATIONAL INTERESTS IN THIS LONG-STANDING RELATIONSHIP
OBAMA SAYS `WE DEPLORE VIOLENCE AGAINST CIVILIANS'
OBAMA SAYS EGYPTIAN PEOPLE `DESERVE BETTER'
OBAMA SAYS U.S. DOES NOT `TAKE SIDES' IN EGYPT
OBAMA SAYS U.S. COOPERATION WITH EGYPT CANNOT CONTINUE AS USUAL
OBAMA SAYS U.S. CANCELLING JOINT MILITARY EXERCISES WITH EGYPT
Full speech as soon as we get it but in the meantime the message is clear: will Egypt please hurry up and blow up in mushroom cloud of smoke - the US needs to boost its deficit spending immediately as otherwise Bernanke's monetizing buttons are tied.
Here is the word cloud of Obama's speech: really who needs more.

Sometimes you take a look at your Netflix queue and think there's nothing decent on the service. That's not entirely true! Netflix has certainly lost its library of mainstream Hollywood films over the past few years. But for the designer in search of inspiration–or anyone with a love of visual culture–Netflix is still loaded with some superb films and documentaries. Here are 22 to get you started. 1-2. Objectified/Urbanized Call it two thirds of director Gary Hustwit's Design Trilogy. Objectified fetishizes the obsession behind industrial design. And Urbanized tours the world of urban planning. (Helvetica, arguably his most renowned film, is currently not available on Netflix Instant). Hustwit has a particular talent for digging into the granular thought processes of modern day designers without ever dumbing down their soundbites. [Watch here and here] 3.

If you boiled down every western you've ever seen into one archetype of gunslinging–then you put that story into the hands of one of the greatest cinematographers in history (Tonino Delli Colli, The Good, The Bad, The Ugly and Life Is Beautiful)–you'd get Once Upon a Time In The West, a rare gem in Netflix's ever-dwindling options for truly excellent streamable films. [Watch here] 6. Leviathan Some documentaries feature a lot of talking heads. Others, a tightly scripted story. Leviathan has no desire for narration. It puts you inside the bowels of a commercial fishing boat, drowning the camera in a dramatic abyss where Moby Dick meets Fight Club, with blood, chains, and horrific storms. The decidedly non-linear structure and use of portable cameras attached to people, animals, and objects offer up visual perspectives that few other documentaries have been able to achieve.[Watch here] 7.

But Metropolis is still an amazing piece of architectural sci-fi, set in a dystopian future in which just about everything has gone to crap except for the unbelievable set budgets. It's hard to believe that the film was made before the advent of computer-generated imagery. Director Fritz Lang relied on tricks like mirrors and miniatures to pull off the film's special effects. If you can't take the pace of the movie's narrative, we won't judge. Just load it up in the background for a bit of visual splendor. [Watch here] 16.

Wall Street posts record gains as millions of Americans face a year of more cuts
Bankers on Wall Street rang in the final hours of 2013 with gains unseen in almost twenty years. However, for roughly half of America, these stock market highs mean nothing as they face a new year with little work and even less of a safety net.
"Never, I don't think, in recent history have you had unemployment this chronically high for so long with the market having done this well," Roben Farzad, an economics writer and contributor to Bloomberg's Businessweek, said on PBS Newshour Tuesday.
"There's a stat that Obama's bull market just beat Ronald Reagan's. I dare say, if you canvass the man on the street, no one would guess that we beat the decade of decadence already. You're certainly not feeling it out there," he continued.
At the end of the day Tuesday, the Standard & Poor index closed with a nearly 30 percent gain, its best since 1997. The Dow Jones Industrial Average also closed at a record high, reaching 16,576.73, up 26.5 percent on the year—marking the largest annual jump since 1996.
And, according to the Wall Street Journal, when dividends are taken into account, stocks posted their best returns since 1995.
However, for the half of Americans who avoid or cannot afford to dally in the stock market, these gains are inconsequential. With the unemployment rate currently near 7 percent, it's clear that many of these corporate gains have not had any positive impact on working people.
As corporate profits after taxes have grown 30 percent since 2007 and the number of jobs is still below its pre-recession level, Farzad asks: "At what point do you see companies feeling so flush, so hale that they see their stock prices and market capitalizations up that they have to go out and hire?"
As Huffington Post reporter Mark Gongloff points out, "corporate profits are soaring largely because companies have been squeezing costs—especially labor costs."
With a scant rise of just 2.1 percent, hourly wages have "barely budged since the market bottomed in 2009," Gongloff reports, "while the Dow has skyrocketed 153 percent."
And for the "man on the street," the New Year will bring changes of another measure.
On Saturday, emergency federal unemployment benefits were allowed to expire for 1.3 million people who have been unemployed more than six months.
"These are precisely the jobless who will suffer most from a cutoff, since they have been scraping by on unemployment checks for so long that their financial situations are already precarious, if not dire," writes Washington Post columnist Eugene Robinson.
Compounding these "dire" financial straits, 2013 also saw the gutting of essential social safety nets.
In November, food stamp benefits were slashed for an estimated 48 million people, including 22 million children, by an average of 7%.
As The Guardian's Karen McVeigh reported last week:
by Jeffrey and Michele Steinberg
Feb. 7—If there were any doubt that the real targets of the Syria regime-change campaign being waged from London and Washington are Russia and China, last week's confrontation at the United Nations Security Council should have erased any last confusion.
On Feb. 4, Russia and China cast their second vetoes of a Security Council resolution demanding the removal of President Bashar al-Assad from power. While the final wording of the resolution did not include a call for foreign military intervention, as was the earlier case with Libya, the essence of the draft, nominally introduced by Morocco, but actually drafted in London, Paris, and Washington, was that Assad had to go.
Prior to the vote, Russia had introduced its own resolution, proposing mediation between the Assad government and the opposition, and Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov had informed the other Security Council members that he would be leading a Russian delegation to Damascus on Feb. 8, in an effort to open direct talks between the Assad government and leading oppositionists. Rather than wait for the Russian diplomatic mission, Britain, France, and the United States forced the Feb. 4 vote—and the fully anticipated Russian and Chinese vetoes.
Within moments of the Russian and Chinese votes, a vicious barrage of attacks is launched against the two permanent Security Council member-states. The U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations, Susan Rice, joined with her British and French counterparts in delivering blood-curdling attacks on Russia and China, accusing them of defending a brutal dictator, and charging that any future bloodshed in Syria would be on their hands.
Throughout the debate, the only person to make mention of the Arab League monitors' report on their month-long visit to Syria, was Syrian Ambassador Dr. Bashar Ja'afari. That report (see accompanying article) made clear that a significant portion of the violence, attributed by the Western media to Assad, has been carried out by armed rebels. Among the actions by the foreign-funded and armed opposition, and documented in the report, were the bombing of power grids, gas pipelines, government buildings, public transportation, and foreign journalists.
Hours after the Security Council debate and vote, the Russian and Chinese embassies in Tripoli, Libya were attacked by Syrian and Libyan hooligans. Dozens of Syrian embassies around the world were also targeted for violent protests. In Sydney, Australia, a pro-Assad activist was shot as he left his home.
World War III
There is much more at stake in the events described above. As published recently in the Russian-language edition of China's People Daily, Russia and China have been drawn together in an alliance for survival, against the increasing provocations from London, and from the British puppet in the White House, President Barack Obama.
According to a senior U.S. intelligence source, both Russia and China have concluded that the Anglo-Americans and their French allies are seeking to establish absolute control over the strategic oil supplies in the Persian Gulf—and that means that both Russia and China must be kept out. For China, in particular, this is an existential issue, given China's growing reliance on energy supplies from the Persian Gulf. At the present time, China is the number one importer of Iranian oil, and China's largest source of oil is Saudi Arabia.
The identical assessment was presented in great detail in the Russian edition of People's Daily of Jan. 31 by Dai Xu, a senior colonel in the People's Liberation Army (PLA) and a prolific commentator on the events of the day.
Dai described the present strategic situation in terms of the new U.S. policy directed against China, where the announcement of the policy—the military pivot to Asia[1]—was soon followed by "provocative moves with its ally, the Philippines." At the same time, the U.S deployed three carriers to the Persian Gulf, and the EU imposed new sanctions on Iran, attempting to constrain that country militarily, politically, economically and diplomatically. The policy, Dai continued, is also aimed at Russia, with the U.S. preparing itself for a "Russian Winter," and making its "preferences known with regard to the expected presidential campaign of Vladimir Putin."
In the face of the U.S. policy, Russia, somewhat unexpectedly, sold anti-aircraft missiles to Iran and fighters to Syria. "In the American strategy, the conquest of the Eurasian land mass is the fundamental field of activity," Dai wrote.
Presently, the ongoing policy of isolating and surrounding Russia and China is the final strategic target, he said. Therefore, there is a need for Russia and China to work together to restrain the actions of the U.S. in pressuring weaker countries to follow their lead. "One might say that the convergence of China and Russia is the inevitable result of the strategic pressure from the U.S., as well as the choices the two sides make in the interest of their own survival. Only together do they possess the strength to withstand the U.S. moves."
Russia and China both possess nuclear weapons, making it more difficult for the U.S., even at the head of NATO, to move against them militarily. Dai noted that this may well lead to a new Cold War.
The PLA assessment was taken one step further in a Feb. 6 interview by the Russian daily Kommersant with Deputy Defense Minister Anatoly Antonov. Antonov announced a planned expansion of Russia's nuclear weapons arsenal, in response to emerging threats from the Obama Administration and allies.
"New challenges emerge, including missile and nuclear proliferation," he began. "Look at how unstable the situation in the Middle East is. That's why Russia's military doctrine envisages the use of nuclear weapons in specific cases. I do not rule out that under certain circumstances we will have to boost, not cut, our nuclear arsenal."
Antonov cited the Obama Administration's refusal to negotiate with Moscow over the deployment of a U.S. missile defense shield over Europe.
"The situation is dismal in this area. The U.S. continues to boost its missile defense potential in Europe and other regions. The European segment of the U.S. missile defense demonstrates aspirations to shift the strategic balance of forces in Europe. After the Cold War, U.S. strategic weapons—and missile defense is a strategic weapon—are getting closer to Russia's borders."
Both the United States and Russia have many nuclear attack submarines, equipped with vast arsenals of nuclear weapons. Over half of the entire U.S. nuclear missile force—over 2,000 warheads—are submarine-based. Russia's submarine force has almost 600 nuclear warheads. Either country has the nuclear firepower to wipe out mankind several times over.
This is the real dimension of the so-called Iran and Syrian crises. London is hell-bent on provoking a thermonuclear war, aimed at wiping out both the Asia-Pacific region and the United States as the priority targets.
There is no other way to interpret the events of last weekend at the United Nations in New York. There is no legitimate reason for the level of provocations being targeted against Moscow and Beijing by London, Washington, and Paris—except that they are out to provoke an all-out strategic confrontation, using Syria and Iran as pretexts.
For London, the motive behind such a berserker drive for thermonuclear World War III could not be more obvious. The entire trans-Atlantic financial and monetary system is hopelessly bankrupt, and time is running out on any efforts to postpone the day of reckoning. According to a senior U.S. intelligence official who stays on top of the European financial crisis, the Inter-Alpha Group-led European private banks will need at least EU5 trillion in zero-interest bailout loans before the end of the year in order to avoid meltdown. This means that the combined U.S. Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank will be carrying out a monetary hyperinflation beyond Weimar Germany's Autumn 1923 blowout.
For London, the prospect of a trans-Atlantic hyperinflationary explosion, while the Asia-Pacific region continues to enjoy relative prosperity, is unacceptable. The Queen believes that genocidal war is preferable to the loss of City of London power.

A judge on the island of Majorca ordered the unnamed gynaecologist to pay the mother 150,000 euros (£120,000) in "moral damages" for his negligence and a monthly maintenance of 978 euros (£780) until the child reaches its 26th birthday.
The court in Palma heard how the woman had sought to terminate an unwanted pregnancy at a clinic in April 2010 when she was eight weeks pregnant but, unbeknown to her at the time, the procedure failed.
She returned to the clinic three months later seeking another abortion because she believed that she had fallen pregnant again.
But an ultrasound revealed she was five months pregnant and she was refused a termination because it was over the legal time limit of 14 weeks.
She was offered a refund of the £320 she paid for the initial procedure and referred to a clinic in Barcelona, which, it was suggested, might have performed a late-term abortion, but doctors there also refused.
She later gave birth to a healthy son, who is now 18 months old.
Judge Jose Perez Martinez, in a written ruling ordered the gynaecologist and the private clinic he worked at to pay compensation to the woman.
He also ordered the doctor to foot the bill for the upkeep of the unwanted child until he turns 26.
The woman, whose identity has been kept secret, spoke through her lawyer of her happiness at the sentence and how she had no regrets about having the child.
"I'm fine now and have accepted things, I haven't any other choice," she said.
"When the day comes for me to explain to my son what happened I will tell him hoping he understands.
"I didn't want him when I went to have an abortion but that's not the case now."
Her lawyer Eva Munar, admitting the sentence was a legal first in Spain, added: "It's a fair sentence for what is medical negligence."
The doctor will launch an appeal to have the sentence overturned.
Spain reformed its abortion laws under the previous socialist government of Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero in 2010. Under the new law, women have the right to choose an abortion on demand after up to 14 weeks of pregnancy in public hospitals.
Under previous legislation, abortion was illegal across Spain unless in the case of rape, serious deformity or if the woman's health was at risk.
More than 100,000 abortions were carried out annually under the old legislation, the vast majority in private clinics and under the justification that the pregnancy posed a "psychological risk" to the mother.
The relaxation of the laws was meant with fierce opposition from conservative elements within Spain and especially the Roman Catholic Church.
Spain's new conservative government of Mariano Rajoy, which came to power in December, has suggested it may overturn the reform – provoking a backlash from women's groups.
Compressed-air energy storage, or CAES, is one of the cheapest ways to store really massive amounts of energy for long periods of time. In fact, beyond pumped hydro storage, compressing air when power's cheap and plentiful and then using it to boost natural gas-fired power turbines during times of peak demand is really one of the only ways to shift hundreds of megawatts of load from one hour to the next.
So why have so few CAES-backed power plants been built? One problem is cost: while they're much cheaper and easier to site than pumped hydro projects, CAES projects are still massive infrastructure projects at the $100-million-and-up scale.
They also have their geographic restrictions: specifically, the availability of vast underground cavern structures to use as reservoirs for all that compressed air. Then, of course, there are regulatory and economic factors that have limited energy storage's appeal in general, which apply to CAES as well.
Put caves and power plants together, however, and the energy storage that results is cost-effective and reliable, as the world's two first CAES projects -- the 290-megawatt plant in Huntorf, Germany, built in 1978, and the 110-megawatt McIntosh, Alabama plant, built in 1991 -- have proven over their combined decades of operation. That's led to a resurgence of CAES projects over the past half-decade or so, driven by technology advances, as well as grid operators' growing need for energy storage to balance intermittent wind and solar power with ever-shifting demand.
The latest comes in Texas, where Dresser-Rand and Apex Compressed Air Energy Storage announced last week that they're building the first big CAES project in the United States in decades. Known as the Bethel Energy Center, the 317-megawatt project will serve Texas grid operator ERCOT, and is the first of more to come from the partners, both in the United States and elsewhere, the companies said.
The project is being built near Tennessee Colony, Texas, a rural crossroads about 100 miles southeast of Dallas featuring a church, a general store, and a Calpine natural gas facility. That part of the state has its share of giant underground “salt dome” caverns, suitable for storing natural gas, as well as pumped air.
Dresser-Rand, the Houston-based supplier of “high-speed rotating equipment and services solutions” for the oil and gas industries, is providing the equipment for the project at an estimated cost of $200 million. Dresser-Rand also built the equipment for the Mcintosh, Ala. CAES plant in 1991. Since then, it's developed an integrated energy storage technology, called SMARTCAES, that it's using in the Bethel project.
There are many different ways to compress air and then use it to provide energy, but in the simplest terms, most CAES projects use it to boost natural gas-fired power turbines. That essentially ties the storage capacity to helping the turbines do whatever they're doing, only at higher efficiency, and without burning nearly as much natural gas to get there. In other words, it can't be turned on and off like a battery.
At the same time, compressed air is a lot cheaper energy storage medium than the electrochemical mixtures contained inside batteries. At $200 million for 317 megawatts, the Apex/Dresser-Rand project adds up to about $630 per kilowatt, or cheaper than any battery technology out there except lead-acid batteries, which have been used for decades on the grid but are short-lived and expensive to maintain. As for scale, the biggest lithium-ion battery grid storage projects out there (AES Energy Storage, BYD) are no bigger than 40 megawatts, a little more than one-tenth the size of the Bethel project.
Apex and Dresser-Rand didn't provide details on how many megawatt-hours of storage the plant would provide, or any other measures of duration for the 317 megawatts of capacity they're planning. Of course, CAES is an inherent part of a natural gas-fired power plant's overall efficiency, which makes it hard to measure against other forms of storage, like pumped hydro or batteries. That efficiency can also come in multiple ways, such as boosting top running efficiency, or helping turbines ramp up or ramp down to match wind and solar power fluctuations -- as well as in terms of how much natural gas it's saving over time.
Texas has a lot of caves, depleted oil wells and other convenient underground empty spaces to fill with compressed gas, and it's also got a lot of wind power that it's struggling to integrate more smoothly into its statewide grid. Both of those features make it a good candidate for CAES projects. General Compression, an ARPA-E-backed startup that's working on a fuel-free CAES technology, announced in April that it's working with ConocoPhillips on a CAES pilot project, also in Texas, in hopes of expanding to commercial scale in the years to come.
In California, Pacific Gas & Electric is studying the idea of building its own 300-megawatt, 10-hour CAES project, meant to use wind power to compress air at night when it's cheap and plentiful, then release it to manage peak afternoon loads. The project costs about $50 million, half of it provided by a Department of Energy smart grid stimulus grant, which means results of its performance will be made public to guide future projects. That site would use porous rock, rather than caverns, to store air, an as-yet unproven technology.
In the meantime, some startups are trying to get rid of the need for conveniently located caves, porous rock formations and other geological anomalies to store air. LightSail Energy, a grid-scale energy storage startup, is working on CAES via aboveground tanks, and is backed by investors including French oil giant Total, Peter Thiel, Bill Gates and Khosla Ventures.
Though the Indian justice system has taken many progressive decisions over the years, the first thing that comes to mind for many is Section 377. The 2013 ruling of India's top court, squashing the Delhi High Court's verdict from a few years earlier legalising consensual homosexual relationships between adults, dealt a huge blow to the country's LGBT (Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender) community, and raised a significant outcry. However, the issue here is not the Indian justice system, but the overly glorified culture of India. A few choices in India become taboo by default as they are deemed to tarnish the so-called beauty and purity of Indian culture.
Amidst all of this, it is extremely refreshing to see student bodies in universities all over the country being more and more accepting of the LGBT community. In a first, a lesbian candidate from Jadavpur University in Kolkata contested the Student Union Elections held in January. What stood out during the entire election process this year was the conscious effort to be accommodating of all, including the non-formative gender identities as well.

Asmita Sarkar is a member of the India Students' Association. She ran for the post of assistant general secretary at the Arts Faculty of the university.
Asmita Sarkar was born in Burdwan, Kolkata, and was mocked all through her life for her tomboyish attitude. She eventually decided to come out of the closet in her first year of college and told her parents. She was then subjected to a lot of discrimination by her acquaintances as well as teachers. Even her parents gave her a hard time as they were unable to accept Asmita's identity.
This never brought Asmita down, and she gradually fought against all tides to reach a place where she was not just comfortable, but also proud of who she is. While speaking with Youth Ki Awaaz, she said,
It is very important to come out of the closet because the society must learn that being a person who has a non-binary identity is nothing against nature.
Asmita is very aware of the stigma around homosexuality in India, and also has very strong opinions about the same. She told Youth Ki Awaaz in her conversation with them,
More often than not, people don't accept that there is anything called homosexuality. It is almost like we don't even belong in the same place; there is no place for the LGBT in Indian society. One needs to be taught about gender and sexuality from the primary level itself. The problem we are facing is that sex education in itself is a taboo in India.
Asmita strongly believes in making the university a more inclusive and safe space for all. She, along with her party, aims to bring about changes in the current scenario of discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation or identity. Though they did not win the elections, the party that has been elected also has a very similar ideology. It looks like Jadavpur University is heading in a positive direction.

Croatia have hired former defender Josip Simunic, who was banned for 10 games for leading fans in a pro-Nazi chant, to assist new national team coach Ante Cacic.
Simunic missed the 2014 World Cup over the incident in the qualifying playoff against Iceland in 2013. The suspension came after Simunic shouted to supporters: “For the homeland!” The fans responded: “Ready!” The chant was used by the Croatian pro-Nazi regime that ruled the state during the second world war.

It highlighted Croatian football's ongoing struggle with discrimination. Croatia have been deducted one point in their Euro 2016 qualifying group after a swastika was seen on the field before June's match against Italy.
Simunic is on the coaching staff of Cacic, who has been given a contract through to the 2018 World Cup. He won the domestic double with Dinamo Zagreb in 2012.
Croatian federation president Davor Suker says “we rely on Croatian brains.”
Simunic, who was born in Australia, has since defended his actions. “Some people have to learn some history,” he said in November 2013. “I'm not afraid. I did nothing wrong. I'm supporting my Croatia, my homeland. If someone has something against it, that's their problem.”

Symptoms of gonorrhoea
The prominent symptoms of gonorrhoea develop within 10 to 15 days of being infected, although most of the symptoms don't appear for months.
It is observed that almost 1 out of 10 men and more than half of the infected women won't experience the common symptoms of gonorrhoea. So, the condition can be left untreated for or delayed for some time.
Symptoms in women
Common symptoms of gonorrhoea include:
The unusual vaginal discharge, which can be watery or thin and yellow or green in color.
During urination feeling of burning sensation may appear.
Tenderness or pain in the lower abdominal region, often it is less common.
Extreme bleeding during periods and bleeding after having sex (it is the least common).
Symptoms in men
The symptoms of gonorrhoea in men commonly include:
The unusual yellow or white discharge from the tip of the penis.
Burning or pain during urination, it is the common observation although it can be related with other factors as well, but can't be ignored.
Swelling or inflammation of the foreskin.
Tenderness or pain in the testicles (least common).
Infection in the throat, rectum or eyes
The infection in the rectum can be developed in both men and women. The infection in the eyes and throat normally occurs during unprotected oral sex. In case, if infected semen or vaginal fluid are in contact with eyes, you are most likely to develop conjunctivitis.
The rectum infection can cause pain or discharge and discomfort. The infection in the eyes can cause pain, irritation, discharge and swelling. The throat infection is not associated with any symptoms.
Seeking medical advice
If you are diagnosed with gonorrhea then early treatment is necessary. If symptoms have gone away on their own until then you need to continue your treatment. This is directly associated with infertility.
A California court has ruled that the University of California, San Diego (UCSD) acted improperly by using a deeply flawed system to adjudicate a sexual assault allegation and sanctioning the accused based on a process that violated his rights.
On July 10, 2015, Judge Joel M. Pressman of the Superior Court of California, County of San Diego, ruled UCSD's procedures violated the student's due process rights and that the evidence did not support the university's finding of responsibility.
A detailed account of the underlying facts of the case was provided in The Washington Post today.
The ruling is the latest in the increasing trend of sexual assault allegations against college students (and universities' responses to those claims) resulting in administrative complaints with the Department of Education's Office for Civil Rights (OCR) and lawsuits by accused students.
This case, Doe v. Regents of the University of California, San Diego, was filed after the university found the petitioner, pseudonymously known as John Doe, responsible for sexual assault after a hearing in December of 2014. Doe was initially suspended for one quarter, subjected to a permanent no-contact order with the complainant, ordered to attend a two-hour sex offense/sexual harassment training, and required to submit to a counseling assessment. Without any explanation, on appeal, his penalty was increased to a suspension for a full year, which required him to reapply to be readmitted. In addition, he was placed on non-academic probation and ordered to attend ethics workshops.
The court ordered UCSD to set aside its factual findings and sanctions because the procedures UCSD used in Doe's case violated his due process rights in several significant respects.
One key failure was that the university did not adequately allow Doe to cross-examine his accuser. The court took into account several factors in reaching this conclusion. First:
The university unfairly limited petitioner's right to cross-examine the primary witness against him, Ms. Roe … . [O]nly nine of Petitioner's thirty-two questions were actually asked by the Panel Chair.
Compounding this unfairness, the record showed that although the hearing panel declined to pose a substantial majority of the questions Doe wanted to ask his accuser, it did not screen any of the questions posed by the university's representatives. The university also allowed the accuser to testify from behind a barrier during the proceedings. Explaining why this was a problem, Judge Pressman wrote:
The Court does not see the necessity of the screen between Ms. Roe and Petitioner. The Court also notes the importance demeanor and non-verbal communication in order to properly evaluate credibility. This is especially true given that the panel made findings in this case from Ms. Roe's testimony and her credibility.
Doe's right of confrontation was also determined to have been violated when the hearing panel relied on evidence that he was not permitted to challenge during the hearing. For example, the hearing panel relied heavily on the findings of a report by the university's Office for the Prevention of Harassment and Discrimination (OPHD), despite not making the report's author available for cross-examination or discussing the report at all until closing arguments at the hearing. Explaining why this was unfair to Doe, the court explained:
First, the Panel relied on evidence that was outside the hearing. Ms. Dalcourt [the author of the report] did not testify. While the technical rule of hearsay is not applicable to the hearing, the hearing did not allow petitioner any opportunity to refute Ms. Dalcourt's findings. Ms. Dalcourt's conclusions were crucial to the findings, but petitioner was denied his right of confrontation. Second, the right of confrontation was compounded because petitioner was not given any of the underlying 14 witnesses interviewed by Officer Dalcourt nor was petitioner provided with Ms. Roe's interview statements on June 12 and July 29. By doing so, the hearing deprived petitioner the opportunity to examine anything about the summary conclusions relied upon by the hearing panel. At no time is Petitioner given the opportunity to confront the OPHD report or Ms. Dalcourt because she was not present at the hearing.
By relying on the OPHD's report, the court found the hearing panel inappropriately delegated its fact-finding responsibility:
[I]t was the panel's responsibility to determine whether it was more likely than not that petitioner violated the policy and not defer to an investigator who was not even present to testify at the hearing. “Due process requires that a hearing . . . ‘be a real one, not a sham or a pretense.[']” Ciechon v. City of Chicago (7th Cir. 1982) 686 F.2d 511, 517. [Citation omitted.]
FIRE has long argued that too many campus sexual assault proceedings involve inadequate procedural protections and that this practice creates injustices for both accused parties and complainants. Procedural protections are not just technicalities—they are crucial to ensuring a fair hearing.
The court also concluded the panel improperly held the accused's silence against him as a sign of his guilt, in violation of the Fifth Amendment:
A basic principle of fairness is that a trier of fact may not draw any inference from a witness's invocation of a privilege. The Panel's findings state: “While John stated during the hearing that he did not digitally penetrate Jane's vagina, he abstained from providing additional information regarding the incident and what occurred around the time of the incident and the panel would have liked to hear more information from him.” This finding indicates weight given to John's assertion of the 5th Amendment privilege. [Citations and exhibits omitted.]
While the Fifth Amendment's right against self-incrimination applies specifically in the criminal law context, it is clear from this decision that the same principles of fairness are at stake when a person's silence is used against him or her in a campus proceeding. This is especially true since statements made by accused students in these campus proceedings are often admitted against them in subsequent criminal trials.
The court ultimately concluded that these shortcomings prevented Doe from getting a fair hearing and that the evidence properly before the campus panel did not justify its finding that Doe had sexually assaulted his accuser. It also concluded that UCSD abused its discretion when it increased Doe's penalties on appeal without any explanation.
The decision in Doe v. UCSD is important because it demonstrates that when courts subject campus proceedings to scrutiny, the ugly truth of their shortcomings is glaring. This is a particularly important ruling in California, where legislators have undermined the due process rights of accused students further by requiring them to prove they obtained affirmative consent in the school disciplinary hearings. Hopefully, more courts will weigh in to restore some semblance of balance so that all students' rights are respected.
Even if you have money, spending it on your date won't always impress. Creativity and resourcefulness can score more points than dropping big money on a fancy dinner that didn't take much thought. If you are unemployed or thrifty, that's no reason to stay at home alone. Ask your date what they like to do and come up with a plan that shows you listened and you put in effort.
Many of my free date ideas listed below are inspired by my childhood, when entertainment was often free and stemmed from a playful, adventurous attitude while appreciating what's abundantly offered by the universe. Most of these ideas have been tested and approved. If you don't have a romantic date, you can apply these to friend dates and they'll love you for it.

The Clintons: is the Oregon standoff really about uranium?
by Jon Rappoport
January 27, 2016
(To read about Jon's mega-collection, Power Outside The Matrix, click here.)
Note: This article was written before the Oregon shootout in which one man was killed and another wounded.
Is uranium at the heart of the Oregon Malheur federal-protestor standoff? That's the question I'm asking. It isn't a flippant question.
I realize there are many other issues swirling around this event. The Hammonds, the Bundys, militias, the feds, cattle grazing on federal lands, federal land grabs, and so on. This article isn't meant to take apart those matters.
It's meant to follow up on my previous article, in which I present a circumstantial case for the Clintons' heavy involvement in a scheme that's transferred 20% of US uranium production to Putin and Russia. And the key company in that piece is Uranium One. Remember the name. It's apparently a major clue in what I'm about to discuss.
I also want to say, at the outset, that I don't know how many independent news outlets and websites are covering the uranium question, or which outlet initiated this line of investigation. I'm relying on one provocative January 23 article at intellihub, by Shepard Ambellas:
“Clinton Foundation took massive payoffs, promised Hammond Ranch and other publicly owned lands to Russians, along with one-fifth of our uranium ore.”
Down in the body of that article, the author provides a link to a page at the US Bureau of Land Management (BLM), which is a federal agency under the Department of the Interior.
On that BLM page (“National BLM > OR/WA > Energy > Uranium Energy”), in a section titled, “Uranium on BLM-Administered Lands in OR/WA,” [(image of webpage forthcoming)] is the following statement:
“In September 2011, a representative from Oregon Energy, L.L.C. (formally Uranium One), met with local citizens, and county and state officials, to discuss the possibility of opening a uranium oxide (‘yellowcake') mine in southern Malheur County in southeastern Oregon. Oregon Energy is interested in developing a 17-Claim parcel of land known as the Aurora Project through an open pit mining method. Besides the mine, there would be a mill for processing. The claim area occupies about 450 acres and is also referred to as the ‘New U' uranium claims.
“On May 7, 2012, Oregon Energy LLC made a presentation to the BLM outlining its plans for development for the mine.
“The Vale District has agreed to work with Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife on mitigation for the ‘New U' uranium claims, which are located in core sage grouse habitat. Although the lands encompassing the claims have been designated core, the area is frequented by rockhounds and hunters, and has a crisscrossing of off-highway vehicle (OHV) roads and other significant land disturbance from the defunct Bretz Mercury Mine, abandoned in the 1960s.
“However, by the fall of 2012 the company said that it was putting its plans for the mine on hold until the uncertainty surrounding sage grouse issues was resolved.”
The first sentence in that BLM section ties together several key elements of the story: Uranium One; a uranium mine; southern Malheur County. Southern Malheur is the general area of the federal-protestor standoff. Let me give you that first sentence again:
“In September 2011, a representative from Oregon Energy, L.L.C. (formally Uranium One), met with local citizens, and county and state officials, to discuss the possibility of opening a uranium oxide (‘yellowcake') mine in southern Malheur County in southeastern Oregon.”
What does this have to do with Hillary and Bill Clinton? I'll reprint my previous article so you can read the details, but the short version is: there's a case to be made that they, through Uranium One and the Clinton Foundation, facilitated the sale of Uranium One to Putin and the Russians. And if so, and if this area of Oregon is projected to be part of that uranium mining deal, then we are looking at a stunning “coincidence”: the US federal government is coming down hard on a group of protestors who are occupying, for their own reasons, a very valuable piece of territory that goes far beyond the issue of private cattle grazing on government land.
It comes under the heading of those old familiar lines: you have no idea what you're involved in; you have no idea who you're messing with; this is way over your head; you just stepped into the middle of something that's bigger than you can imagine.
Here is my previous article in full, “The Clintons: how Putin grabbed a fifth of all US uranium.” I'll have a few important comments to make after the article:
—She's the next US President, if an old socialist, a cowboy real estate hustler, and a bunch of emails can't stop her.
He already was the President.
They're married. Cue the dawn sunrise and violins for the beautiful first couple of American politics. Wow. In a land where they're the first couple, does anybody have tickets to sell for the next flight to Mars?
Before I board my flight, what about the uranium scandal?
The what?
Before I quote a NY Times piece on this, consider—suppose, just suppose the beautiful first couple has been running a kind of parallel operation to the government, in the form of a foundation that is taking in major chunks of cash from people who want political favors. Just suppose. And a few donors who are ponying up those $$ want to sell a company to the Russians. But because this company sells a very, very sensitive product, and that product happens to come out of the ground in the US, agencies of the US government have to approve the sale. And one of those agencies that does approve the sale happens to be headed up by half of that beautiful couple. And this sensitive American product, well, the last person you'd want to control it is the head of a place called Russia—he can sit in Moscow and have complete dominion over this product that exists on US soil…and nobody thinks this is a problem, as half of the beautiful couple runs for President of the United States. It's a yawn. It was a big story for a day or two, and then it sank below memory and everybody moved on. Forget about it. Who cares?
Memory is short. On April 23, 2015, the NY Times ran a story under the headline: “Cash Flowed to Clinton Foundation Amid Russian Uranium Deal”.
The bare bones of the story: a Canadian company called Uranium One controls a great deal of uranium production in the US. It was sold to Russia (meaning Putin and his minions). So Putin now controls 20% of US uranium production.
From the Times:
“…the sale gave the Russians control of one-fifth of all uranium production capacity in the United States.”
From the Times:
“The [Pravda] article, in January 2013, detailed how the Russian atomic energy agency, Rosatom, had taken over a Canadian company [Uranium One] with uranium-mining stakes stretching from Central Asia to the American West. The deal made Rosatom one of the world's largest uranium producers and brought Mr. Putin closer to his goal of controlling much of the global uranium supply chain.
“But the untold story behind that story is one that involves not just the Russian president, but also a former American president and a woman who would like to be the next one.
“At the heart of the tale are several men, leaders of the Canadian mining industry, who have been major donors to the charitable endeavors of former President Bill Clinton and his family. Members of that group built, financed and eventually sold off to the Russians a company that would become known as Uranium One.
“Frank Giustra…a mining financier, has donated $31.3 million to the foundation run by former President Bill Clinton…”
“Since uranium is considered a strategic asset, with implications for national security, the deal [to sell Uranium One to Putin] had to be approved by a committee composed of representatives from a number of United States government agencies. Among the agencies that eventually signed off was the State Department, then headed by Mr. Clinton's wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton.
“As the Russians gradually assumed control of Uranium One in three separate transactions from 2009 to 2013, Canadian records show, a flow of cash made its way to the Clinton Foundation. Uranium One's chairman used his family foundation to make four donations totaling $2.35 million. Those contributions were not publicly disclosed by the Clintons, despite an agreement Mrs. Clinton had struck with the Obama White House to publicly identify all donors. Other people with ties to the company made donations as well.
“And shortly after the Russians announced their intention to acquire a majority stake in Uranium One, Mr. Clinton received $500,000 for a Moscow speech from a Russian investment bank with links to the Kremlin that was promoting Uranium One stock.
“At the time, both Rosatom and the United States government made promises intended to ease concerns about ceding control of the company's assets to the Russians. Those promises have been repeatedly broken, records show.
“Whether the donations [to the Clinton Foundation] played any role in the approval of the uranium deal is unknown. But the episode underscores the special ethical challenges presented by the Clinton Foundation, headed by a former president who relied heavily on foreign cash to accumulate $250 million in assets even as his wife helped steer American foreign policy as secretary of state, presiding over decisions with the potential to benefit the foundation's donors.
“In a statement, Brian Fallon, a spokesman for Mrs. Clinton's presidential campaign, said no one ‘has ever produced a shred of evidence supporting the theory that Hillary Clinton ever took action as secretary of state to support the interests of donors to the Clinton Foundation.' He emphasized that multiple United States agencies, as well as the Canadian government, had signed off on the [uranium] deal and that, in general, such matters were handled at a level below the secretary. ‘To suggest the State Department, under then-Secretary Clinton, exerted undue influence in the U.S. government's review of the sale of Uranium One is utterly baseless,' he added.”
—The US State Dept. had to sign off on the deal giving Putin control over US uranium. Hillary headed up the State Dept. Much money from Canadian mining executives, who obviously wanted the deal to go through, found its way into the Clinton Foundation. The Foundation concealed these donations.
That's called a circumstantial case. Every such case is different, and has to be judged by assessing probabilities. But for example, if an examination of two involved prominent figures revealed they were serial liars, it would strengthen a verdict of guilty.
If you're Putin and you're sitting in Moscow, and the uranium deal has just dropped this bonanza into your lap, what's your reaction—after you stop laughing and popping champagne corks? Or maybe you never really stop laughing. Maybe this is a joke that keeps on giving. You wake up in the middle of the night with a big grin plastered on your face, and you can't figure out why…and then you remember, oh yeah, the uranium deal. The US uranium. Who's running the show in America? Ha-ha-ha. Some egregious dolt? Maybe he's a sleeper agent we forgot about and he reactivated himself. And this foundation—how can the beautiful couple get away with that? And she's going to be the next President? Can we give her a medal? Can we put up a statue of her in a park? Does Bill need any more hookers?
You shake your head and go back to sleep. You see a parade of little boats carrying uranium from the US to Russia. A pretty line of putt-putt boats. You chuckle. Row, row, row your boat…merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily…life is but a dream.
Good times.

So we have the Clintons, and Uranium One sold to Putin, and that sale gives him control of 20% of US uranium production. Now we have an area in Southern Oregon which has uranium, and in this area, the feds are coming down on the protestors and the occupiers.
What are the feds really trying to protect? Are they just trying to stop cattle grazing and routine burns on that land, or is there something farther precious at stake?
The feds aren't known for making delicate distinctions. People are raising a bit of hell in the general (or specific) area where uranium mining could commence. Get them out of there! Move them off! No more cattle grazing here! This is a matter of national security!
Or it was. Now it's a matter of Russian national security.
Make deal, protect the dealers. It's business.
Consider the potential scandal and the massive irony: US citizens are asserting their sovereign right to use federal land, land that should never have been co-opted by the federal government in the first place—and now it turns out to be Russian land.

Welfare sucks. Don't misunderstand, it is wonderful that this type of funding is available to help people. Of course and I am grateful for social assistance in this society. But it sucks to have to be on it, at all, never mind at the current rates which are actually far below the poverty line.
I had to utilize welfare myself, as a young person, when my first band, Gorilla Gorilla, relocated to Vancouver armed with our skateboards, our demo tape, and our dreams.
Welfare enabled me to find housing and secure employment. Within just a couple months, I started to work, my life progressed, and I was able to discontinue social assistance. The rest, as they say, is history.
But, what if I didn't find my dishwashing job? Or what if I was unable to work, say, if I had a seizure disorder, or if I were in a car accident? Or what if I was in a domestic abuse situation where my leg was broken and I could not look for a job for a few weeks? What if I had small children and no childcare? What if I had debilitating depression and could not access care or mental health support? Or what if no one would hire me?
Those are only a few examples. There are as many reasons for a person needing support as there are people on assistance. In British Columbia, that means hundreds of thousands of people on temporary assistance, disability assistance, or who are waiting to qualify. To receive welfare in B.C., a person really has to be virtually destitute, and that is the truth.
The Welfare Food Challenge aims to demonstrate the reality of living on the amount an individual receives: $610 for one month. Let that sink in. For. The. Month.
This is supposed to cover everything, including: housing, food, personal hygiene, clothing, household supplies, and, as they are required to look for work, transit, and a cell phone—yes, a cell phone; it's 2015 and there are no payphones, remember?
Are you still with me? While you consider your own mortgage or rent and sip coffee in one of Vancouver's latest cool boulangeries and continue reading this (which I am deeply grateful for, so thank you for staying with me) here is a real teeth-kicker:
The City of Vancouver found that the average rent of an SRO (which stands for “single-room occupancy”) is now $450.00 a month. To give you more perspective: the provincial government's shelter allowance portion of welfare is just $375.00 a month.
The reality is, if you or I or our mothers were on welfare right now in B.C., we could not afford shelter. Really.
Then, with the remainder, there's damage deposit (approximately $20 for an SRO), bus tickets ($21), the cheapest cell phone one can find that still works ($25), and personal hygiene and laundry ($10). It totals at about $526.00.
This leaves just $84.00 for food for a month.
Ladies, gentlemen, and everyone, that is about $21 per week.
Thus, Welfare Food Challenge participants live on only the food they can purchase with $21 for a week.
Food for the week. Bif Naked
Last year, I tried to be a pragmatic vegan eater, and purchased a bag of brown rice, two cans of no-name chickpeas, seven bananas, seven zucchinis, two heads of lettuce, one bag of spinach, and one container of cherry tomatoes. I ran out of bananas by the third day, zucchini by the fifth day, and by the last day I was constipated—from all the rice, something I don't normally eat, having actually been a raw-food vegan for almost 10 of my 20 years as a vegan—and had a migraine.
This year, I chose basically the same things (because my eating has not deviated) with the exception of the rice (constipating) and lettuce (too expensive). I replaced these items with four eggplants, which I could quarter and eat with my nightly chickpeas-and-zucchini combo. The bananas and spinach were for my morning smoothies. As in previous years, I ran out of food, again leaving me with half a banana and a quarter cup of chickpeas for my last two days. Brutal.
This year, still on cancer medication (which I could not afford on welfare as myparticular care is no longer covered by MSP—long story) and in full menopause since I was 37, my emotional state turned to complete garbage. I found myself bit teary and overwhelmed at the slightest of things, all of the time. I felt lousy, to say the least. And very hungry for things I took for granted, like apples, celery, juices, and coffee.
If my digestive tract, dopamine and serotonin depletion, and headaches were not bad enough, the sudden onslaught of derogatory messages on my social media pages was.
It was astonishing to read all the messages dismissing, degrading, and downright bashing poor people. Of course, there were also many positive messages. But why do haters feel the need to yell their abuse? My heart broke. I was devastated.
Not for what they were saying to me. (Things like “Shut the fuck up and Go back to your tour bus, Whore.”, “Why don't you give them your millions, you loser has-been cunt.”, or my favourite, “You should have died of cancer, one less person to be a bleeding heart for all the junkies and hookers on the street.” , to cite just a few examples.) It was the hundreds of comments about poverty and the poor that made me cry. Literally.
“They are all lazy, getting a handout from my tax money!,” read one. “Why should I give them any handouts? They just spend money on cigarettes and alcohol,” a mother of two wrote.
Or, as one man said, “I work hard for my money. They are lazy.” Or, “They get too much from the Government, already. Get a fucking job!”
It was a glimpse into what this society, what our society, believes about poor people. I was shocked. In fact, the more questions I asked, the more I discovered that people generally are classist and racist. Last year, I even had a total falling out with a long-time friend upon discovering they were secretly classist and bigoted and resented my involvement with the Welfare Food Challenge. She believed the dumbest shit, and was unmoved by my efforts to dispel myths.
Some of those misconceptions include:
People on welfare are lazy. (Not true.)
It is easy to get welfare (Not true. It is difficult for most people to qualify.)
People can access food banks easily. (Not true for everyone.)
Homeless people are all drunks or drug addicts. (Not true.)
I had to stand up and speak up about this.
I could not sit by and let people talk badly about the blameless people I knew and shame them for being on welfare. The fact is that most people on welfare have a serious disability due to an illness or an accident, or they are fleeing abusive situations or are suffering long-term unemployment. People are on welfare due to misfortune. And misfortune can strike almost any one of us. I had to try to change people's minds.
What is a person supposed to do?
I have a big mouth. Not just according to my late father, a dentist, either. It's actually my job.
Joining the Welfare Food Challenge again this year is something I was looking forward to. I planned my travel schedule around it. Is it a publicity stunt?
Not for me, of course. But hopefully it draws attention to the hundreds of thousands of British Columbians living well below the poverty line, trying to survive on welfare.
Along with hundreds of other Welfare Food Challenge participants, I am indeed trying to raise awareness about the plight of our poor, to promote understanding, and to educate the public to dispel the myths about welfare and welfare recipients. The idea is to encourage change and to try to get the attention of those with power to make those changes: your provincial government.
As a society, we are judged on how we treat animals, the poor and the sick, and our seniors. And we should be.
Blaming poor folks is not the way to express the need for change. Really, fault lies with the government, which should be ashamed for imposing such poverty on people who through misfortune are unable to have a job.
Spread the word. Speak up for others and join me in writing letters and signing petitions to your government. Please go to www.raisetherates.org and be the change.
In a rebuke to a feminist idea that has migrated from college campuses to mainstream culture, an influential legal group overwhelmingly rejected Tuesday a provision that would have endorsed an “affirmative consent” standard for the purpose of defining sexual assault.
In a voice vote at the American Law Institute's 93rd annual meeting at the Ritz-Carlton, Washington, D.C., the vast majority of an estimated 500-member crowd declined to amend the Model Penal Code to define sexual consent on an affirmative basis.
The MPC is a leading guide for state legislatures to follow when standardizing their penal codes. One of the items up for debate at the annual meeting was how to define “consent” in the context of sexual assault.
Standards of affirmative consent, which generally require parties to affirmatively and continually vocalize their willingness to participate in a sexual encounter, have mostly germinated on college campuses, as well as in a few states in some contexts, including California and New York.
The ALI's consideration of such a standard has been met with much internal and external criticism.
A group of 120 members wrote a public letter denouncing the proposal, arguing affirmative consent improperly shifts the burden of proof onto the accused when charges of sexual assault are levied. By forcing the accused to prove the near-impossible — that a sexual encounter was vocally agreed upon at each stage — affirmative consent standards deny the accused due process rights, the letter said.
Brookings Institution Nonresident Senior Fellow Stuart Taylor Jr., who attended part of Tuesday's meeting, applauded the ALI's rejection of the affirmative consent standard as resistance to an ideologically-driven and unrealistic idea.
“I think it's a very encouraging indication that the broad membership of the American Law Institute, which is a pretty elite group, has repudiated a radical expansion of sex-crime law that was sought by a powerful faction of people whom I regard as ideologues,” Mr. Taylor said.
He said the ALI's acceptance of the provision wouldn't have made affirmative consent “the law anywhere,” but added that it would have been a “step toward it being the law in a lot of places.”
He said affirmative consent is simply an unrealistic standard for governing sex.
“The general problem of affirmative consent is it ignores the reality of how sexual activities often happen, which does they often happen silently,” Mr. Taylor said. “People don't say, ‘May I touch you here? May I touch you there?' Or even if they said, ‘May I touch you here?' they may go on to ‘there' without verbalizing it.”
“If one party at one point in a sexual encounter is sort of passive, is sort of quiet, then that's rape,” he said of the standard. “It makes it very easy for prosecutors to coerce plea bargains, or angry former sex partners to put someone in prison. They hardly even have to lie.”
Spearheaded by New York University Law Professor Stephen J. Schulhofer — an influential ALI “Reporter” who sat on a panel at the head of the Ritz-Carlton ballroom during deliberations — the affirmative consent amendment has been through several revisions since an initial draft was introduced in April 2015. Mr. Schulhofer could not be reached for comment.
E. Everett Bartlett, president of the Center for Prosecutor Integrity, who attended the meeting, said the idea of affirmative consent as a way to cut down sexual assault is alluring, but ultimately misguided.
“Affirmative consent sounds wonderful in theory; in reality, it's a nightmare because it's impractical, and there's no way for an accused person to prove his innocence,” Mr. Bartlett said. “The overwhelming vote of the ALI membership to strike affirmative consent from the Model Penal Code was the right thing to do.”
The April 2015 draft defined the consent standard as “positive agreement”; a September 2015 draft dropped the affirmative consent standard for non-penetrative sexual acts; and a December 2015 draft termed the standard “contextual consent,” which critics argued was a distinction without a difference.
The Schulhofer-backed amendment introduced at the annual meeting was somewhat diluted, mentioning the importance of both verbal and nonverbal cues for determining sexual consent.
It defined consent as “a person's behavior, including words and conduct — both action and inaction — that communicates a person's willingness to engage in a specific act of sexual penetration or sexual contact.”
In its final form, the proposal did not require explicit vocalization before engaging in sexual acts, as other affirmative consent laws have. But Mr. Taylor said even though “they didn't call it affirmative consent at the end, that's what it amounted to.”
The amendment was met by a counterproposal, introduced by former U.S. Pardon Attorney Margaret Love, who defined consent as “a person's willingness to engage in a specific act of sexual penetration or sexual contact.”
After nearly two hours of deliberations, one ALI member who was in the room said four-fifths of the crowd voiced support in favor of Ms. Love's amendment.
The ALI still has to vote on other matters regarding sexual assault in order to completely reject the affirmative standard of consent.
Tuesday's vote dealt with Section 213.0 of the MPC, which only concerns the definition of consensual sex. Section 213.2, for instance, which has not been voted upon, specifically addresses penetrative sexual assault.
After the ALI membership approves a section, only editorial, not substantive changes to the proposed statutory language can be made, meaning the content of Section 213.0 cannot be altered. Numerous other sections still need to be reviewed and approved by the ALI membership, which means final approval of the overall MPC is still a long way off.

He enthralled Victorian England with his unrivalled skill at cracking cases, based on astute logical reasoning and grasp of forensic science, not to mention a mastery of disguises and encyclopedic knowledge of the criminal underclass.
But this detective was not Sherlock Holmes but a real life investigator, Jerome Caminada, who, new research suggests, helped inspire Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's celebrated hero.
A biography of Caminada out this month reveals a series of striking similarities between him and the fictional character, in terms of their unorthodox methods and character. It also establishes strong echoes between the real detective's cases and plot lines used by Doyle.
The author, Angela Buckley, has even established that Caminada's casework involved tackling an alluring and talented criminal, similar to Irene Adler, and that the detective even had a Moriarty-like nemesis who plagued him over the course of several cases until a final, dramatic confrontation.
Mrs Buckley said: “Caminada became a national figure at just the time that Sherlock Holmes was being created. There are so many parallels that it is clear Doyle was using parts of this real character for his.”
The son of an Italian father and Irish mother, Caminada was based in Manchester, but was involved in cases which took him across the country, and he enjoyed a nationwide profile in the press, where accounts of his exploits were widely reported.
Most of his career was spent with Manchester City Police Force although he later operated, like Holmes, as a “consulting detective”.
He emerged to prominence in the mid 1880s, shortly before Sherlock Holmes made his debut in A Study in Scarlet and parallels soon emerged between the two.
As the fictional character relied on an network of underworld contacts – the Baker Street Irregulars – so Caminada was known for his extensive web of informers, whom he would often meet in the back pew of a church.
These characters helped him build up an encyclopedic knowledge of the criminal fraternity, among whom he would often move in disguise – another tactic in common with Holmes, who is played, in his most recent reincarnation, by Benedict Cumberbatch,
Like his fictional counterpart, Caminada was particularly noted for his tendency to prowl the streets of the roughest neighbourhoods alone at night, fearlessly intervening in any crimes he encountered.
His skill with disguises was so renowned that on one occasion, while tracking a group of thieves at the Grand National dressed as a labourer, his own chief constable was unable to recognise him.
Other disguises included as drunken down and outs, as well as working class roles. However, he also posed as white collar professionals, once while bringing a bogus doctor to justice.
Dubbed the 'terror to evil doers' and, later 'the Garibaldi of Detectives', he was reputed to be able to spot a thief by the way he walked – apparently as a result of visits he undertook to prisons, to watch inmates walking around the yard to familiarise himself with their appearance and gait.
Over the course of his career, he was reportedly responsible for the imprisonment of 1,225 criminals. His most famous case – and perhaps the one which most closely resembles a Holmes story – was the apparently baffling “Mystery of the Four-Wheeled Cab”.
The BBC show Sherlock (BBC)
Two men had taken a horse drawn cab. On the journey, one leapt out and the other was found dying inside.
There was no obvious cause of death and few obvious clues to go on, but through a series of deductions of which Holmes himself would be proud, Caminada eventually identified the culprit as Charles Parton, who had drugged the other man before getting into the cab, in an attempt to rob him.
Another notable case involved him playing a prominent role in the nationwide hunt for Fenian terrorists, who were responsible for a series of explosions around the country.
Mrs Buckley, a family historian and trustee of the Society of Genealogists, identifies Caminada's “Moriaty” figure as Bob Horridge, a violent, intelligent career criminal, with whom he had a 20-year feud, which began when Caminada arrested him for stealing a watch, landing him with a sentence of seven years' penal servitude because of his previous convictions.
This harsh sentence for a relatively small crime angered Horridge so much that, as he was sent down, he swore revenge on the detective.
On his release, Horridge's criminal enterprises grew in size and scope, but he was usually able to stay one step ahead of the authorities, often effecting dramatic escapes.
His spree finally ended after he shot two police officers. Caminada tracked him to Liverpool where the detective, disguised once more, eventually apprehended him, after pulling out his revolver a fraction faster than the criminal. Horridge was convicted of attempted murder and sentenced to life imprisonment.
Caminada's “Irene Adler” was Alicia Ormonde, an apparently well-educated woman with an aristocratic background and expensive tastes, who was actually a consummate forger and experienced crook who was wanted across the country for a string of frauds and thefts.
Caminada tracked her down and arrested her, but – in an echo of Holmes' fascination with Adler – the detective apparently became captivated by her.
The case took place in 1890, a year before Adler appeared in A Scandal in Bohemia.
Caminada – who published his memoirs on retiring – died in 1914, the year the last Holmes book was set.
Other individuals have previously been put forward as the basis for Holmes, who first appeared in publication in 1887 and featured in four novels and 56 short stories.
Doyle himself said he had taken inspiration from Dr Joseph Bell, a surgeon at the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh for whom Doyle had worked as a clerk. Like Holmes, Bell was noted for drawing large conclusions from the smallest observations. Sir Henry Littlejohn, a former police surgeon, is also cited as an inspiration for the detective.
However, Mrs Buckley, whose book is called The Real Sherlock Holmes, believes that Caminada was used to give Holmes a better grounding in actual casework among the criminal fraternity, inspiring his detecting styles and some of the baffling cases he encountered.

‘Werewolf Syndrome,' Hypertrichosis, Responsible for Werewolf Legends?
A rare genetic defect causes some people to be born with hair all over their bodies. Fewer than 100 cases of hypertrichosis, also known as “werewolf syndrome,” have been documented in scientific literature and media reports, geneticist Xue Zhang told New Scientist in 2009.
Fedor Jeftichew, better known as Jo-Jo the Dog-Faced Boy, had hypertrichosis and performed in a Russian sideshow, ca. 1880s. (Charles Eisenmann)
It has been found that people with hypertrichosis have an extra chunk of DNA, which may switch on a hair-growth gene nearby. Pragna Patel of the University of Southern California coauthored a study looking at the causes of hypertrichosis published 2011 in the American Journal of Human Genetics. Though the condition was mapped to a particular chromosome in a Mexican family, “the underlying genetic defect remains unknown,” the report stated.
Patel told Live Science in 2011: “If, in fact, the inserted sequences turn on a gene that can trigger hair growth, it may hold promise for treating baldness or hirsutism [excessive hair growth] in the future, especially if we could engineer ways to achieve this with drugs or other means.”
Some people have the hair growth in a localized area, others have it all over the body.
In 2010, Supatra “Nat” Sasuphan of Thailand was named Guinness World Record's hairiest child. She is proud of who she is and doesn't hide it, Guinness noted. “Being hairy makes me special,” Sasuphan told Guinness.
Being hairy makes me special. — Supatra Sasuphan
Savita Sambhaji Raut of Madhavnagar, India, gave birth to her fourth daughter with hypertrichosis in 2013. She told the Daily Mail: “I was so happy to have her alive, but it upsets me. … I am scared for her future but God has chosen us to be like this.”
Could this condition have started the legends about werewolves found in many parts of the world?
One of the most famous purported werewolves was Peter Stubbe (the spelling of his name varies), who lived in Cologne, Germany, in the 16th century. Legend has it locals cornered a wolf one night that had been terrorizing the town, only to find it had become a man they all knew, Stubbe. There's no indication that Stubbe had hair all over his body. In this case, the idea that he was a werewolf may have been motivated by his extreme depravity. He admitted to a secret life that involved Devil worship, incest, murder, and mutilating local livestock.

United Nations (CNN) Russia has derailed a proposed UN Security Council statement that would have condemned North Korea's latest missile launch test, using its veto to torpedo the motion.
The statement, which was tabled by the US, would also tell North Korea not to conduct further nuclear tests.It has conducted five so far, and last week analysts warned that the country's nuclear test site was "primed and ready" for a sixth.
Instead, North Korea tested a missile Sunday, which was said to have failed , provoking more calls for the country to cease its hostile acts.
UN diplomats said the proposed statement of condemnation had consensus from the other 14 Council members, including China, North Korea's biggest ally and a Council permanent member.
Russia has a long record of vetoing resolutions pushed by the US. Last week, it used its veto power to block an attempt to condemn the killing of dozens of people in a suspected Syrian chemical attack. In that instance, China abstained.
Little hope is held for reviving the motion against North Korea -- one diplomat said it was unlikely the Security Council would be able to resolve differences on the statement.
Next week, US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson will chair a minister-level meeting on the North Korean issue at the UN.

Haley: Ball's in N. Korea's court
US Ambassador Nikki Haley told UN reporters it was "up to North Korea to avoid further trouble."
She said that she wanted Pyongyang to see that the US was not an aggressor.
"I think it's important that North Korea knows we're not trying to pick a fight, so don't try and give us one," she said.
"And, it's up to them to kind of see it. We've said it as clearly as we can possibly say it. You know, the ball is in their court. They shouldn't try and play at this point."
The reclusive nation, which has long pursued nuclear ambitions, conducted its fifth nuclear test last September, its most powerful so far. It is not a signatory to the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, the global ban on nuclear explosive testing.
Another day, another White House Petition; this one, however, should have fans of crazy cars we don't get in the US all worked up right now.
There's a petition now to the Barack Obama Administration to Repeal the DOT/EPA “25-Year Rule” Car Import Ban. The proposal put forward by Petrolicious is to change it to a 15-year ban on vehicles that do not comply with federal motor vehicle standards and therefore were never sold in the US new.
The Motor Vehicle Safety Compliance Act of 1988, an attempt to stop grey-market importers from trying to adapt foreign-market vehicles to US standards, has long been a thorn in the side of people who want to import Nissan Skylines and weird Citroens legally, for example.
The points made in the petition:
• Differences between U.S. vehicle and the rest of the car producing world are shrinking all the time. Most 15-year-old cars coming from Canada, Europe, or Japan will not be significantly different in safety or emissions
• Importers of grey-market vehicles have been targeted by monies taxpayers have intended to be used to secure our country against terrorist activity.
• There's no reason why rules couldn't be relaxed with no real detriment to safety or environment.
You have until Sept. 5 to sign the petition, and it needs 100,000 signatures by then for a White House response.
And after all this, what car would you want to import most if the ban is repealed

On 13 July 1931, the people of Srinagar marched to the central jail in solidarity with Abdul Qadeer who was charged with sedition by the Maharaja. During the protests, over 22 Kashmiris were martyred by the Dogra forces. Amidst a lot of wails and screaming, the martyrs were laid to rest after Mirwaiz Yusuf Shah requested for their burial at the Naqshbandi sahab shrine. In that moment, some ordinary Kashmiri hoisted a bloody red shirt on a stick and waved it. This became Kashmir's first flag of resistance.
The recent media hysteria over the two flags issue inflated by the powerless unionists in Kashmir is a stale recipe that always shows itself. Somehow the Indian Media always finds issues to somehow impose their rabid narrative on Kashmir. Most of these narratives are blatant propaganda equipped with flashy montages and fake accents. The fact check or intelligence of these ‘journalists' goes for a toss.
Over time, it has seemed like the two flags i.e one of the Indian state and another one of Jammu Kashmir is the only bone of contention. With the JK High court ordering the Jammu Kashmir flag to be made mandatory on all government buildings and vehicles. While as wannabe Bill o' Reillys try to equate this issue parallel to the Azadi and in fact one of them even equated Omar Abdullah to a ‘separatist'. This goes to show that despite the services rendered by the pro-India politicians to the Indian state, the mistrust for them among Indian intelligentsia persists.
The Jammu Kashmir flag which is described in Section 144 of the Jammu Kashmir constitution, the upholders of this constitution are bound to hoist it on their offices and official cars. The flag has three staffs and a plough with red in the background, this is basically the National Conference flag adopted in 1939 known as ‘Albe'an'.
The flag takes its inspiration from the communist movement due to Sheikh Abdullah's communist leanings that also led to the land resettlement bill to uproot feudalism. It was given constitutional sanction by the 1952 constituent assembly that also ratified accession of Jammu Kashmir with India, which was later dismissed by a UN resolution in 1956-57 saying that constituent assembly cannot replace the plebiscite.
On the other side is the prominently featured Azad Kashmir flag which was created in 1947-8 by a large section of people at Muzzafarabad during the first Kashmir war. According to AJK Supreme Court Justice Yusuf Saraf, the flag was inspired by the Pakistani and American revolutionary flag
Symbolically the flag represents many aspects of Azad Jammu and Kashmir:
Three Fourths green background representing the seventy-five percent Muslim population of the State of Jammu and Kashmir. One Fourth Orange (Gold) color represents the twenty-five percent minorities of the State of Jammu and Kashmir.
The Green stripes represent the Valley of the State of Jammu and Kashmir.The White stripes represent the snow-covered mountains of the State of Jammu and Kashmir.The Crescent is the usual semblance of the state of Jammu and Kashmir.
This flag was adopted by Azad Jammu & Kashmir on 24th September 1975. The flag was adopted by the passing of the Azad Jammu and Kashmir State Flag Ordinance, 1975 by the then president, Sardar Mohammad Ibrahim Khan.
Sardar Ibrahim was the first barrister of Kashmir, who led the 50,000 volunteers in Poonch to fight against the Dogras and later the Indian Army. This war against Dogras happened on 17 October 1947, before the Afridis came into Kashmir. That's a discussion for later on.
It was substituted by the late Sardar Abdul Qayoom Khan in the 1970s when he became the head of Azad Kashmir. Later Qayoom's flag was abrogated and the old flag was brought back on to the top of government buildings and official cars.
Liaquat Ali Khan, Field Marshal Ayub Khan, Choudhary Ghulam Abbas Khan, Mirwaiz Yusuf Shah and host of international leaders have saluted this flag. It is also included in the United Nations record.
In the late 20th century, this flag has been hoisted by various Kashmiri leaders in exile. It was on the desk of the legendary Dr. Ayyub Thakur and JKLF offices around the world.
This flag is spotted in many Pakistani cricket and hockey matches wherever there's a significant population of Kashmiri diaspora especially England. It's also waved during pro- Kashmir protests around the globe.
For many years, Kashmiri intellectuals and activists have had many discussions about having a single flag for Jammu Kashmir. There have been yahoo groups, facebook pages and other forums dedicated to creating a flag. Does Kashmir have a flag of its own?
The Jammu Kashmir flag making media bytes have very little significance for ordinary Kashmiris, who see it as a part of the Indian state. The flag is the last legacy of the autonomous Kashmir for which Sheikh Abdullah shook hands with India. It is a form of nostalgia for National Conference supporters, a party that has been spearheading the exploitation of the people. The thrust made to signify this flag as a form of ‘separatism' is a narrative to create confusion among the people.
In fact, the rabble-rouser Engineer Rashid even had a flag hoisting ceremony some time ago. Without any awareness of realities of this symbol, many gullible Kashmiris even stood up to the icon of our cruel oppression.
It becomes important that Kashmiris are educated of their own history, not through chastisation of delirious Indian media. As far as the flag of Kashmiris is considered, the bloody shirt has seen many a hoisting over the last two decades.

PHILIP Hammond's “appalling” comments blaming the disabled for tanking the economy will likely stop firms hiring people who have a disability, according to one of Scotland's leading charities.
Hammond told a committee of MPs on Wednesday that the high number of disabled people in the workforce was “something we should be extremely proud of” but “may have had an impact on overall productivity measurements”.
The comment was quickly criticised, with Labour calling on the Chancellor to either apologise or resign.
Bill Scott, the Director of Policy for Inclusion Scotland told The National he was shocked by Hammond's comment: “This will likely damage disabled people's employment prospects. He's saying an employer taking a disabled person will get lower productivity than a non-disabled person. There's no evidence to suggest that.”
He added “Germany has the highest rate of employment for disabled people in Europe, it also has the highest rate of productivity.
“I've no idea what he was thinking”.
Speaking to the Treasury Select Committee on Wednesday, Hammond said: “It is almost certainly the case that by increasing participation in the workforce, including far higher levels of participation by marginal groups and very high levels of engagement in the workforce, for example of disabled people - something we should be extremely proud of - may have had an impact on overall productivity measurements.”
Scott pointed out that it was untrue to say there were more disabled people in employment.
“Proportionately there are less disabled people in employment than when the Conservatives came into office.
“The government has an objective to get a million people into work, well he's just set back that agenda. It will discourage people from taking on disabled people.
Part of Inclusion Scotland's remit is to speak to employers and make the economic case for hiring a disabled people into work.
“He's just torpedoed that,” Scott said. “You genuinely despair at times about what's going through his mind.”
Around 7 million people of working age in the UK have a disability, or health condition but less than half of them, just 47.6 per cent, are employed.
Just under 80 per cent of non-disabled people are employed.
Labour's Shadow work and pensions secretary Debbie Abrahams wrote to Hammond and the Prime Minister demanding action.
“Philip Hammond's lack of remorse following his disgraceful comments yesterday which tried to scapegoat disabled people for a productivity crisis created by the Conservatives' failed economic policies, is unacceptable,” she told HuffPost UK.
“I have written to Philip Hammond demanding that he come to the House and make a formal apology for his crass statement. I have also written to the prime minister. If Hammond fails to do so, then the prime minister must sack him.”
Susan Daniels, chief executive of the National Deaf Children's Society, said: “The chancellor's comments are deeply worrying. As the profoundly deaf chief executive of a leading charity, I've ignored everyone who ever told me to limit my ambitions and rein in my expectations.
“Given the right support a deaf person can do anything a hearing person can, yet we know that 56 per cent of deaf people have experienced discrimination at work and 25% have left a job as a result.
“In its words and actions the government needs to show complete commitment to breaking down the barriers to employment for deaf young people and others with disabilities. Anything less is unacceptable.”
THE Prime Minister is cracking down on anti-vaxxers, insisting that all parents who don't have their children immunised should be denied welfare payments.
But in November 2006, Tony Abbott's attitude was vastly different. The then-Health Minister said he “wouldn't be rushing out to get his daughters vaccinated” against cervical cancer.
“Maybe that's because I'm a cruel, callow, callous, heartless bastard but, look, I won't be,” Mr Abbott told Southern Cross radio. “If there is a national immunisation program, I certainly will be making sure that they get vaccinated under the program.”
Mr Abbott's comments came as the Pharmaceutical Benefit Advisory Committee (PBAC) knocked back an application from Australian manufacturer CSL to make the Gardasil vaccine available free to all females aged 12 to 26.
Gardasil halts the spread of sexually-transmitted human papilloma virus (HPV), which causes 70 per cent of cervical cancers. It was developed by Australian Ian Frazer, who was recently shortlisted for the European Inventor Award 2015 for saving countless lives with his discovery.
Liberal Senator Jeannie Ferris, who was recovering from ovarian cancer when Mr Abbott made his comments, was fiercely critical of his stance. “How embarrassing that our country is the one that is not going to vaccinate its daughters,” she said. “I have to say I am very disappointed with the decision because the average family might have two daughters and is looking at almost $1000 to decide to give their children lifetime protection. And who doesn't want to do that?
“I am optimistic that commonsense will prevail. Put a price on somebody's mother, somebody's sister, somebody's wife — $400 — I don't think so.”
Mr Abbott's then-counterpart, Julia Gillard, told ABC Radio at the time: “The PBAC's principle reason, as I understand it, was the cost of this vaccine. That's pretty short-sighted when we know that this vaccine is going to cut cervical cancer by 70 per cent.”
Then-Queensland Deputy Premier Anna Bligh said the decision was ridiculous. “They should immediately reconsider it, and frankly the Health Minister Tony Abbott, in all conscience, has to intervene.”
Twenty days later, Mr Abbott asked PBAC to consider a new submission from CSL with more information and at a lower price “given the possibility of introducing an immunisation program through schools in 2007”.
In April 2007, Gardasil was made available free to girls aged 12-13 as part of the National Immunisation Program. In February 2013, it was also made available to boys aged 12-13.
But it was not a priority for Mr Abbott in early November 2006.
“The program is what the experts think clearly is absolutely necessary, and at the moment the experts don't think this is absolutely necessary,” he said.
NEW BRUNSWICK, NJ – Former Edison police officer Michael Dotro will spend the next 20 years in prison for a series of crimes committed in the last five years, including the attempted murder of a supervising officer and his family, officials said yesterday.
According to a press release from the Middlesex County Prosecutor's Office, Dotro, 40, of Manalapan, will serve at least 17 years of his sentence before being eligible for parole as part of a plea agreement.
Middlesex County Superior Court Judge Pedro J. Jimenez Jr., imposed the sentence Thursday, Sept. 7, in accordance with a plea agreement reached with Middlesex County Assistant Prosecutor Russell Curley. In addition, the Judge ordered restraining orders to protect the victims involved, the release said.

“We are satisfied now that Michael Dotro has been convicted and sentenced to 20 years incarceration for crimes which all of our many honorable police officers find repugnant,” Prosecutor Carey said in the release. “Over the past few years, the Prosecutor's Office, along with Edison Police Chief Thomas Bryan, and members of Edison Police Department, have worked diligently to remove the cancerous officers from the ranks of the department. As a result, police officers can proudly wear the Edison Police shield as they protect and serve all members of the public; and our residents can be confident that the Edison Police Department is functioning effectively and with integrity.”
According to the release, Dotro received 20 years for attempted murder in the first degree and 10 years for aggravated arson in the second degree for setting the May 23, 2013, fire at the Monroe Township home of another Edison officer, who was his supervisor.
Both sentences are subject to the No Early Release Act, which requires him to serve 85 percent of the sentence before being eligible for parole, the release said.
In addition, he was sentenced to 10 years for official misconduct in the second degree, five years for conspiracy to tamper with a witness in the third degree and 18 months for conspiracy to retaliate in the fourth degree, officials said.
All sentences are to run concurrent for a maximum of 20 years.
Dotro is also to serve five years of parole supervision once released from state prison, the release said.
The former police officer was charged during an extensive investigation by the Detective Bureau of the Middlesex County Prosecutor's Office; led by Det. Donald Heck and Det. Christopher Pennisi.
Minister says renewables transition can radically slash greenhouse gases by mid-century, but omits coal exit strategy
By Megan Darby in Berlin
Germany is drawing up an action plan to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions 95% from 1990 levels by 2050.
Drawing on a public consultation launched last year, the environment ministry expects to present the proposal to cabinet before the summer recess.
It is a “mammoth task with profound implications,” environment minister Barbara Hendricks said at a conference in Berlin. “No sector will be excluded from this transition.”
The long term target is at the higher end of the 80-95% range agreed across the EU, based on holding global temperature rise to 2C.
Hendricks stressed the importance of the aspirational 1.5C limit on global warming agreed at last year's UN climate talks in Paris.
“There are places in the world where the extent of global warming can mean the difference between survival and destruction,” she said.
Emissions were 27% lower than 1990 levels last year at 908 million tonnes of CO2-equivalent, according to official data, leaving a huge undertaking to reach the 95% target.
At the second annual Berlin Energy Transition Dialogue, hosted by the foreign ministry, the focus was on expanding renewable energy.
There was no mention of the coal sector, which continues to be Germany's main source of electricity. Nor did the federal environment agency's official estimate that carbon dioxide emissions increased 0.7% last year come up.
“We are convinced our energy transition is one of the most effective climate policy instruments,” said Hendricks.
The German vision of community-owned wind, solar and bioenergy production to reduce reliance on nuclear and fossil fuels was touted as a model. In 2015, renewables supplied a record high 32.5% of the country's power demand.
Thomas Silberhorn, a senior official at the development ministry, cited partnerships with Ghana and India on integrating renewable capacity.
Germany is the single biggest donor, with €3 billion, to the Africa renewable energy initiative, which aims to install 10 gigawatts across the continent by 2020.
“If we want to ensure the survival of humankind on this planet, we need a global energy transition,” Silberhorn said.
American physicist and environmental writer Amory Lovins praised the German government for embracing change.
One of the intellectual pioneers of citizen-centred energy, Lovins said: “Germany's choice of the disruptive energy system, supporting the new and not just protecting the old, might just save the world.”

SBI Ripple Asia will reportedly begin testing a funds-transfer system using digital ledger technology (DLT) between Japanese and South Korean banks by the end of 2017.
The company – a joint venture between Toyko-based financial services firm SBI and DLT payments startup Ripple – has already led a consortium of banks to complete a pilot implementation using Ripple's technology within Japan earlier this year. According to local media, SBI Ripple Asia will now work alongside blockchain and AI solutions provider DAYLI Intelligence for the expansion of the scheme into South Korea.
SBI Ripple Asia was founded in early 2016, with an eye to amplifying the use of Ripple products and services in Asian markets, as previously reported by CoinDesk.
The venture is also planning a program, commencing in October, to train engineers from around 20 companies in blockchain and cryptocurrency technologies. Companies involved include Nomura Research Institute, Toppan Printing and NEC, reports indicate.

Reactive MVP [Giorgio Natili @giorgionatili]
The model view presenter ( MVP ) is a robust architecture that allows us to break our application into smaller, modular, testable and composable component. But, it does not solve how to manage concurrent or async events in such a way that your app will still work smoothly and your code stay readable. To address the concurrency problem, one possible solution is to use RxJava. In this talk, we will explore how you can compose RxJava with MVP to create both a robust architecture and logical concurrency flow.

Video narrated by Concussion Legacy Foundation CEO Dr. Chris Nowinski
A concussion is a type of traumatic brain injury caused by a bump, blow, or jolt to the head or by a hit to the body that causes the head and brain to move rapidly back and forth. Rapid movement causes brain tissue to change shape, which can stretch and damage brain cells. This damage also causes chemical and metabolic changes within the brain cells, making it more difficult for cells to function and communicate. Since the brain is the body's control center, the effects of a concussion can be far-reaching.
Concussions are usually not life-threatening, but the effects of a concussion can change a life and the injury should be treated seriously.
The CDC estimates as many as 3.8 million concussions occur in the U.S. annually through sports and recreational activities, however only a fraction are recognized by athletes, coaches, parents, and are treated by medical professionals.
Teenagers are especially vulnerable to concussion. A 2017 survey of teenagers by the CDC found that 2.5 million teenagers experienced a concussion in a sport or recreational activity, and 1 million teenagers reported two concussions in the previous year.
Signs and Symptoms of a Concussion
The signs and symptoms of a concussion are incredibly important because a concussion doesn't show up on imaging like an x-ray, CT, or MRI scan and there is no objective test, like a blood or saliva test, that can determine if a patient has a concussion. A doctor makes a concussion diagnosis based on the results of a comprehensive examination, which includes observing signs of concussion and patients reporting symptoms of concussion appearing after an impact to the head or body. Concussion signs and symptoms are the brain's way of showing it is injured and not functioning normally.
Concussion Signs
Concussion signs are what someone could observe about you to determine if you have a concussion. Signs of a concussion range from obvious to much more nuanced, but even one sign of a concussion after a hit to the head should be reported to a medical professional.
Common concussion signs include:
Loss of consciousness
Problems with balance
Glazed look in the eyes
Amnesia
Delayed response to questions
Forgetting an instruction, confusion about an assignment or position, or confusion of the game, score, or opponent
Inappropriate crying
Inappropriate laughter
Vomiting
Concussion Symptoms
Concussion symptoms are what someone who is concussed will tell you that they are experiencing. Concussion symptoms typically fall into four major categories:
1- Somatic (Physical) Symptoms
Headache
Light-headedness
Dizziness
Nausea
Sensitivity to light
Sensitivity to noise
2- Cognitive Symptoms
Difficulties with attention
Memory problems
Loss of focus
Difficulty multitasking
Difficulty completing mental tasks
3- Sleep Symptoms
Sleeping more than usual
Sleeping less than usual
Having trouble falling asleep
4- Emotional Symptoms
Anxiety
Depression
Panic attacks
Note: This is not an exhaustive list of concussion signs and symptoms, and it may take a few days for concussion symptoms to appear after the initial injury.
Concussion Response
If you suspect a concussion in an athlete, it is extremely important to remove that athlete from play immediately so they can be evaluated by a trained professional. A 2018 University of Florida study found that among college athletes across 18 sports who ceased activity once they were injured missed three fewer days of competition than those who delayed reporting. Additionally, immediate removal from activity reduced concussion symptoms by about two days and decreased the likelihood of missing more than two weeks of participation by 39 percent. To learn more about what you should do after a concussion, visit our Concussion Response page.
After removal from play, doctors recommend physical and cognitive rest for a few days following a concussion, or until you see a medical professional. Hear from Dr. Robert Cantu, medical director of the Concussion Legacy Foundation, about why the brain needs rest after it has been injured:
Recovering from concussion means your brain cells must return to the normal function by rebalancing levels of chemicals, like sodium and calcium, inside and outside of the cell. This process takes a lot of energy, so it is important to conserve energy during recovery. When properly managed, the majority of concussion symptoms will resolve within a couple of weeks, however over-exertion of brain cells during recovery can cause symptoms to persist for months or even years. A significant percentage (estimates vary between 10% and 30%) of concussion patients suffer from extended recovery, known as Post-Concussion Syndrome.
Finding the right doctor to help you with your concussion is key to making a full recovery. To help you find treatment in your area, we developed our Concussion Clinics Tool. Just type in your area code and find specialized concussion treatment near you.
The importance of prompt concussion reporting inspired our Team Up Speak campaign. The goal of Team Up Speak is to make sure that every youth athlete knows that being a good teammate means getting them help as soon as they might have a concussion. Sign your team up for Team Up Speak today.
Catastrophic re-injury: Second Impact Syndrome
During recovery, the brain is more vulnerable to re-injury. In rare cases, a second concussion sustained during recovery can cause the brain to undergo massive swelling. This extremely rare condition is known as Second Impact Syndrome (SIS). Approximately half of SIS patients die from their injuries, and the survivors often suffer from life-long disability.
Read the heartbreaking stories of Rowan Stringer and Nathan Stiles to learn about young athletes who lost their lives to SIS.
A preventable epidemic
The good news is we can stop concussions before they happen. There are many opportunities to reduce concussions through smart policy decisions. Research has shown more than half of all head impacts and concussions in football occur during practice; in middle school soccer players there are 100,000 concussions caused by heading every three years. The Concussion Legacy Foundation has led the movement to reduce hitting in football practices at the youth, college and professional levels. Our Safer Soccer campaign led to a rule change in soccer that prohibits players 10 and younger from heading the ball and reduces headers for 11 to 13-year-old players. There is still a lot to do to make sports safer for all athletes and the Concussion Legacy Foundation will continue to be on the forefront of research and education.
VANCOUVER, Sep. 25, 2017 (Canada NewsWire via COMTEX) -- INVICTUS MD STRATEGIES CORP. ("Invictus MD" or the "Company") (IMH) IVITF, -0.77% (fra:8IS1) is pleased to announce that construction of the Phase 2 development, a purpose built, multiple room production facility, is well underway at its wholly owned subsidiary, Acreage Pharms Ltd. ("Acreage Pharms"), a licensed producer under the Access to Cannabis for Medical Purposes Regulations ("ACMPR").
The foundation for the Phase 2 facility has been poured and the exterior is expected to be completed by the first part of November 2017. By the end of January 2018, the interior fit-out is expected.
While the facility was originally planned for 27,800 square feet, utilizing best practices learned from previous developments, the design was optimized to increase it to 32,000 square feet. The additional space will provide added capacity to accommodate administrative and production staff. The new facility will house nine, 1,600 square foot flowering rooms, maximizing available floor space and allowing for a fully controlled and optimized environment facilitating a harvest every two weeks and enabling the growth teams to complete all their procedures in the same day. Additionally, a second level 8 vault will be constructed giving Acreage Pharms the ability to store some $60 million of cannabis product at a given time.
Commencing February 2018 Acreage Pharms will have a production run rate of approximately 5,000 kgs of cannabis per annum based on the improvements realized from Phase 1 plus the construction of the Phase 2 facility. Given the location of Acreage Pharms in West-Central Alberta, electricity for the facility is being achieved at 2.8 cents per kW, which is one of the lowest rates in Canada. Additionally, there are no fees related to the disposal of water at the facility given it will be processed utilizing a septic tank and drain field method. These factors among others will allow Acreage Pharms to be very competitive while producing high-quality cannabis at one of the lowest cost per gram in the industry.
The capital costs of constructing the Phase 2 facility continue to remain within the $6 million that was initially budgeted.
Initial harvests in the existing state-of-the-art production facility, using pesticide free growing systems and Good Production Practices, has resulted in high quality, non-irradiated medical cannabis. Currently Acreage Pharms has 80,000 grams of dried cannabis in its vault, ready for sale once it receives its sales license.
"Invictus MD currently has $27 million in cash in the treasury. This cash has been earmarked for expanding square footage to meet the significant demand that is not only currently existing as part of the medical market but also to accommodate the recreational market that will commence mid next year. Invictus MD has enough cash in the treasury to expand its canopy footprint on its 250 acres of property and produce 15,000 kg's per annum making it one of the top producers under the ACMPR." said Dan Kriznic, Chairman & CEO, of Invictus MD. "The construction plans at Acreage Pharms has been our corporate strategy to take advantage of the current and future demand for a high quality standardized pesticide free product, in this emerging market."
About Invictus MD Strategies Corp.
Invictus MD Strategies Corp. is focused on two main verticals within the Canadian cannabis sector, namely the Licensed Producers under the ACMPR, being its wholly owned subsidiary Acreage Pharms and its non-wholly owned affiliate AB Laboratories Inc.; along with Fertilizer and Nutrients through its non-wholly owned subsidiary Future Harvest Development Ltd.

Washington (CNN) The battle for America's political soul could come down to a street brawl between two boys from Queens and Brooklyn.
Donald Trump and Chuck Schumer are spoiling for a clash once the President-elect takes office next year and the new Democratic Senate minority leader gets his hands on his caucus after winning election on Wednesday.
Schumer had hoped to be directing a Senate majority to implement Hillary Clinton's agenda, but the stunning upset in last week's election means he is the lone hope for Democrats as they resist an unexpected Republican presidency and GOP dominance on Capitol Hill.
"Chuck Schumer is going to be the single most influential Democrat in Washington," said Jim Manley, a former top aide to retiring Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid. "He is, as leader of the Senate Democratic caucus, the only thing standing between the Trump-Ryan legislative agenda and those who are opposed."
Trump and Schumer -- both flamboyant, media savvy, outspoken, deal-making larger-than-life New York personalities have history. In fact, Schumer is one of the few political figures in Washington who Trump actually knows well, and the billionaire contributed to several of his new rival's election campaigns.
Schumer even rode to Trump's defense when he got embroiled in a primary spat earlier this year with Ted Cruz over "New York values." Schumer (Brooklyn) and Trump (Queens, then Manhattan), had common cause against the Texas senator.
Schumer could never have expected he would be matching wits against Trump in the White House -- but the next stage of their political relationship promises to be one of the most intriguing stories of 2017.
Given their common experience in the New York fishbowl, where business and politics mix, both probably have an idea of what makes the other tick. That alone contrasts with the awkward relationship between President Barack Obama and Senate GOP leader Mitch McConnell, who lacked a common political language. McConnell would prefer to work with Vice President Joe Biden instead.
Skirmishes between Trump and Schumer will also reflect the ironic influence of the elite East Coast haven of New York on top-level politics in Washington -- after an election decided in the industrial heartlands of the Rust Belt.
Expect fireworks
Trump, with his reality television background, promises to dominate the conversation once he moves to Washington in January.
But in Schumer, Democrats also possess a megaphone, and a contrast to the soft-spoken Machiavellian Reid, who was more of an inside player.
Schumer's facility with the media led to the Washington cliche that the most dangerous place in the city was between him and a camera, but in recent years he has refashioned his image and spent less time in television green rooms.
He's promoted other Democrats from his spot on the party's Senate Democratic leadership team and become a more rounded political figure.
"He has become a much more serious legislator and I think Republicans understand that," Manley said.
Still, Schumer's capacity to drive a sharp political message and sense of shifting political winds will be vital to Democrats as they climb off the canvas.
Schumer the politician is known as a schmoozer, who is willing to engage the other side but to also fight tenaciously.
Schumer "has generally worked well with Republicans even though he can be a fierce partisan," said Jim Kessler, who was a senior aide to Schumer on Capitol Hill for eight years and now is senior vice president for policy at Third Way.
"He has a belief that politics is a rough sport but it can be played fairly and cleanly. If you play the game that way even if you take a shot at him he feels that it is fair and doesn't ruin the relationship," Kessler said.
If it comes to a knife fight with Trump, Schumer is unlikely to shirk from a confrontation and will marshall his Democrats behind him.
"This is a guy -- he wants to win," said Jim Battista, a professor of political science at the University at Buffalo, New York, where Schumer is a fixture at commencement ceremonies.
"It's not much use being the minority leader, if ... he is not winning."
Dealmaking possible?
Still, if common ground does emerge in the new Washington, Schumer is likely to explore it.
In recent years, he has built relationships with Republicans like Sen John Cornyn of Texas and Lamar Alexander of Tennessee. And it's likely his interactions with McConnell will not be as publicly acidic as those between Reid and the Republican leader in recent years.
The Democratic leader in waiting's first task is to restore equilibrium to his traumatized party. By January, he must chart a strategy for their efforts next year to emerge as a roadblock to Trump and to salvage as much as they can of Obama's legacy by wielding the Senate filibuster.
Then, Schumer must steel his party for a tough set of re-election races in the mid-terms in 2018.
Fresh from his uncontested election on Wednesday, the product of years of behind-the-scenes maneuvering that speaks to Schumer's political shrewdness, the New York senator vowed to stand firm against Trump but to also seek areas where the next president and Democrats can work together.
"When we can agree on issues, then we're going to work with them," Schumer said. "But I've also said to the President-elect on issues where we disagree, you can expect a strong and tough fight."
Possible common ground includes Trump's proposals for a massive infrastructure building program and a plan to censure China for what critics say is currency manipulation.
But hopes for cooperation hit a reality check this week, with the appointment to a top White House job of Stephen Bannon, a Trump ally who has links to the white nationalist movement.
The move alarmed some Democrats because it appeared to suggest that the Trump administration would embrace some of the darker aspects of the Republican's campaign — but it also energized a party that had spent the days since the election wallowing in grief.
"We're going to keep a really careful eye on the president and on him. If they do anything from this day forward -- they've done so much awful from this day back -- and we're going to go after them in terms of bigotry," Schumer said.
Rebuilding the Democratic brand
One of Schumer's most important duties -- as the effective leader of his party in Washington, will be to repair Democratic links to blue collar and middle class Midwestern voters who defected to Trump.
With that in mind, he expanded the Senate Democratic leadership team to include Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, whose populist primary campaign tapped into the sense of economic malaise and anti-establishment fervor exploited by Trump.
Schumer's critics have long pointed to his ties to Wall Street finance and big money donors to question his fealty to working class Democratic values.
But Kessler said no one in American politics has a better understanding of the economic challenges facing voters.
"He has the best intuitive sense of the middle class of any politician I have ever met," said Kessler.
"He comes from the middle class, he still lives in a middle class area, and he obsesses about them and their well being. If there was ideology called middle class it would be his."
As he reaches out to disaffected Democratic voters, Schumer might be influenced by his own dealings with economically challenged areas of his own state, where he won a thumping 70% of votes in his re-election race.
"He's a broadly seen as a Manhattan guy who is working at not appearing so much of a Manhattan guy," said Battista, who said Schumer had taken pains to understand the concerns of Western New York, including campaigns to keep the Buffalo Bills from relocating. "He's somebody who has always seemed to be comfortable sitting down and talking to the Rust Beltier parts of New York."
PARMA, Ohio - Three people are in custody and facing charges accusing them of attacking Chuck E. Cheese's employees earlier this month.
Jermele L. Barkley, 35, of Cleveland, and Albert W. Brown, 41, of Lorain, surrendered to police Tuesday morning. They are in custody at the Parma Detention Center, police said.
Both men are charged with felonious assault and aggravated riot and will appear in Parma Municipal Court at 12:30 p.m. Tuesday, Parma Lt. Kevin Riley said.
Chakara L. Watts, 22, of Cleveland, was arrested last week in connection with the March 8 incident. She is charged with aggravated riot and her case has been bound over to the Cuyahoga County Common Pleas Court, Riley said.
Parma police have also obtained an arrest warrant for a 22-year-old man who lives in another state. He will be surrendering to authorities next week, police said.
Parma police will also be seeking charge against a boy in connection with the incident.
Surveillance video showed the customers punching and shoving Chuck E. Cheese's employees during the March 8 attack in Parma.
At least five patrons were involved in an attack on employees about 7:15 p.m. during a birthday party at the West Ridgewood Drive restaurant and entertainment center. The patrons involved in the fight fled before police arrived,
Two employees were seriously injured and treated at University Hospitals Parma Medical Center. Six employees were injured in total, including five who were treated at the hospital, Parma Police Lt. Kevin Riley said.
The fight began after the customers, who were there celebrating a child's birthday, paid their bill. One of the customers complained about a photo booth that was not working, and a manager spoke to the group.
One of the customers was dissatisfied with the manager's explanation and followed him back to the kitchen area, where he attacked the manager. At least four other customers joined in, and at least five other employees attempted to break up the attack, police said.
The Trump administration's top immigration agent said Tuesday that he plans to ramp up investigations of businesses that knowingly employ illegal immigrants.
Speaking at a panel discussion at the conservative Heritage Foundation, Immigration and Customs Enforcement Acting Director Thomas Homan said the agency will prioritize worksite enforcement as a way to reduce the flow of illegal immigrants into the U.S.
“Unless you remove the magnets [for illegal immigration], as long as they think they can come here and get U.S. citizenship and not get removed, they're going to keep coming,” Homan said. “As long as they can come here and get a job, they're going to try and come. So we are stepping up worksite enforcement.”
Homan said he studied the amount of time ICE agents were spending on workplace investigations and determined he wanted those efforts to increase by “four to five times.” In addition to bringing charges against companies that violate employment law, he said, ICE will also initiate deportation proceedings against illegal immigrants found at worksites.
“We're going to do it a little differently than we've done it,” Homan said. “We're going to prosecute the employers who knowingly hire illegal aliens, and we're going to detain and remove the illegal alien workers.”
The Trump administration has already initiated legal action against several companies that either knowingly hired illegal immigrants or used guest worker visas to discriminate against native-born job applicants.
Earlier this month, Asplundh Tree Expert Co. pleaded guilty to a running a scheme to employ illegal workers and was ordered to pay a total of $95 million, the biggest penalty ever levied in an immigration case.
Before the Asplundh settlement, the Department of Justice's Civil Rights Division sued a Colorado company for allegedly hiring foreign guest workers at the expense of qualified U.S. citizens. The lawsuit was the first under the DOJ's Protecting U.S. Workers Initiative, a program initiated by Attorney General Jeff Sessions in order to investigate employment discrimination on the basis of U.S. citizenship.
At Heritage, Homan said those types of enforcement actions would become a bigger priority in the coming year.
“We're taking worksite enforcement very hard this year,” he said. “We've already increased the number of inspections and worksite operations, you're going to see that significantly increase this next fiscal year.”

Peggy Young, left, sued UPS in 2008, claiming they must make accommodations for her pregnancy as they had done for other employees with physical limitations. She is pictured here in 2014. Supreme Court lightens load for pregnant employees
The Supreme Court made it easier Wednesday for women to sue their employers for failing to accommodate a pregnancy.
In a 6-3 decision the court revived a lawsuit brought by a former United Parcel Service driver named Peggy Young who sued the company —- under the Pregnancy Discrimination Act of 1978 —- after it denied her “light duty” when she became pregnant. Young will now have the opportunity to allege discrimination under the theory set forth in today's opinion.
Story Continued Below
The decision, which allows pregnant women to sue their employer even when they don't have direct evidence of discrimination, will likely prompt employers to accommodate pregnant employees more readily than they have in the past.
Under the ruling, employers must grant pregnant employees accommodations if they have previously granted the same accommodations to large groups of other employees with similar physical limitations. Young had claimed UPS offered light duty to injured workers and should have offered the same to her.
“The record here shows that Young created a genuine dispute as to whether UPS provided more favorable treatment to at least some employees whose situation cannot reasonably be distinguished from hers,” said Associate Justice Stephen Breyer in the majority opinion.
“This is a big win, not just for Peggy Young but also for all women in the workplace,” said Samuel Bagenstos, Young's attorney. “The Court recognized that a ruling for UPS would have thwarted Congress's intent in passing the Pregnancy Discrimination Act … It's a big step forward towards enforcing the principle that a woman shouldn't have to choose between her pregnancy and her job.”
The worker-friendly ruling is a departure of sorts for the business-friendly court, which under Chief Justice John Roberts has ruled against Amazon.com contract workers seeking overtime pay and, more famously, denied former Goodyear employee Lilly Ledbetter compensation for years of pay discrimination, leading Congress to amend the relevant statute early in President Barack Obama's first term. Roberts sided with the majority Tuesday, as did the court's three women justices, Elena Kagan, Sonia Sotomayor and Ruth Bader Ginsburg. Associate Justice Samuel Alito concurred in a separate opinion.
Wednesday's decision prompted Sen. Bob Casey (D-Pa.) to pledge that he would introduce a budget amendment on workplace discrimination. “While the Court's decision is a victory for Peggy Young,” Casey said in a written statement, “it still leaves too much uncertainty for other pregnant workers.” Casey said his bill would “streamline the process for pregnant workers to receive reasonable accommodations.”
The decision is a rare win for both women's rights groups and anti-abortion groups. Both had joined Young's cause in briefs seeking greater job protections for pregnant women.
Young sued UPS in 2008 claiming the company was required under the 1978 Pregnancy Discrimination Act to accommodate her in the same way it accommodated employees who were hampered by other physical ailments. The high court stopped short of interpreting the 1978 law as broadly as Young proposed.
In a written statement, UPS said it was “pleased that the Supreme Court rejected the argument that UPS's pregnancy-neutral policy was inherently discriminatory.” The company said it was “confident” that when the case was sent back to the lower courts they “will find that UPS did not discriminate against Ms. Young under this newly announced standard.”
In the majority opinion, Breyer wrote that the court would not confer “most-favored-nation status” on pregnant employees. Instead, Breyer wrote, Young could use a long-held standard used in discrimination cases brought in other contexts under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.
Associate Justices Antonin Scalia, Clarence Thomas, and Anthony Kennedy dissented from Wednesday's majority opinion. Scalia argued that the court was creating a new interpretation of the Pregnancy Discrimination Act out of whole cloth.
“The Court seems to think our task is to craft a policy-driven compromise between the possible readings of the law, like a congressional conference committee reconciling House and Senate versions of a bill,” Scalia said.
“It takes only a couple of waves of the Supreme Wand to produce the desired result. Poof!” he added.
During the appeal, UPS rescinded the policy in question, saying it did so in response to new guidelines by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. “We have been in business for more than 100 years,” UPS said Wednesday, “and have learned that the ability to change and adapt is fundamental to our success.”
Correction: An earlier version of this piece stated, erroneously, that the decision came down Tuesday.

9 | One of the greatest exploitation movies of all time
Rape, gory violence, great villains, a killer signature song from Alice Cooper ("I Am The Future"), and solid performances from genre vets such as Perry King ("Mandingo", "Search and Destroy") and Roddy McDowell equal one of the greatest exploitation films of all time. King starts work at a crime-ridden school and is targeted by a nasty gang led by the disturbed, spoiled, vicious, gifted youth Stegman (Timothy Van Patten). Not able to ignore the non-stop assaults and abuse of other teachers and students, King wages a nasty war with Stegman and his goons and, in the process, endangers both his own life and the life of his wife. Director Mark Lester, who was handed the "Commando" gig after the surprise international success of this pic, never made another movie as tight, violent and dramatically coherent. It is a textbook example of how to do exploitation right. In addition to the mean-spirited mayhem, there are other special treats such as a moving scene in which the arrogant Stegman sits at a piano and plays like a maestro in front of his stunned class and teacher. Actor Van Patten, who gives a believable, knock-out performance, actually composed and played the piece himself. Michael J. Fox plays a nerdy student ally of King's, and McDowell, always reliable, is great as a teaching veteran pummeled into submission by decades of classroom violence. The film carried a prophetic message back in the early 80's when it was made, and it's a message that is even more appropriate today in our politically correct times where teachers have no power to discipline students and students have every right at their disposal and know it. The film's climax is explosive and Lester never lets a gory opportunity pass him by. A classic in every sense.
The top Republican in Virginia's House of Delegates is calling to end the tradition of addressing lawmakers by formal male and female pronouns, after the state elected its first openly transgender candidate.
Lawmakers, who have been typically addressed as "gentleman" or "gentlewoman," would now be referred to as simply "delegate," the Washington Post reported.

The change has been lauded by Republican lawmakers, while Democrats called the decision "shameful," saying that lawmakers "ought to be big enough to get over these hang-ups we have."
"All members will be afforded the same respect and courtesy that this nearly 400-year-old institution commands," a spokesperson for Republican House Majority Leader M. Kirkland Cox said. "Speaker-designee Cox believes the 'gentlelady' and 'gentleman' terminology is outdated, and that referring to everyone as 'delegate' is more timely and appropriate."
The statement came amid questions about how the newly elected Democratic Delegate Danica Roem would be addressed when the new legislative session began in January.
"If Danica Roem had not won the election we would still be doing the same thing we have done for 400 years," Democratic Delegate Kenneth R. Plum said, expressing disappointment in the change. "Calling each other gentleman or gentlelady. It's unfortunate that we, in effect, have to single out her election, as unique as it is.
During Roem's campaign, she was repeatedly referred to as a male by her opponent, Republican Rep. Bob Marshall. A flier that was paid for by Republican Party of Virginia also used male pronouns and "accused her of trumpeting her transgender identity to win more votes," the Post reported.
"They're trying in some way to thread a needle with their own base," Bob Holsworth, a former Virginia Commonwealth University political-science professor said. "They're willing to change the tradition in this sense before they will explicitly acknowledge Danica Roem as a woman."

Marshall also penned a letter to the editor a little more than a week after his loss to Roem and said, "Virginians must wake up, not be intimidated and fight this radical transgender agenda for the sake of our children and grandchildren."
But Roem has shrugged off the news and instead wants transgender people to realize that elected office is a possibility.
"What matters the most is that I'm there," Roem told the Post. "What matters the most to the people of the 13th District is that the woman they elected to serve them will be working on their behalf. I will be the delegate from Prince William, and I will conduct myself as the gentlewoman from Prince William while I'm in Richmond and in any other official capacity in which I serve."
Ducati rider Lorenzo had taken the lead of the Motegi race on the opening lap, but began to fade soon after, rapidly losing positions.
But his descent down the order was also assisted by a clash with Tech 3 Yamahas Zarco, as the rookie nudged the three-time premier-class champion wide on exit of the Turn 9 left-hander.
“It wasn't the first time that I got a contact with Zarco this year,” Lorenzo said after the race. “He is very aggressive overtaking, I think it's too much.
“Looks like it is similar as when you play on PlayStation. He feels like there is no rider in front of him and he is just entering your line and he doesn't care.”
Lorenzo subsequently recovered from his early-race slump to finish sixth, re-passing Zarco for position late on.
The Frenchman, who is enjoying a hugely impressive first season in MotoGP, had drawn the ire of another of the sport's elder statesmen earlier this year - with Lorenzo's former teammate Valentino Rossi having criticised Zarco after clashes in Austin and Assen.
Lorenzo continued: “I would like to speak with Safety Commission to see what you can do because for me, something can happen in the future.
“He is not aware that he is too aggressive. I went to talk to him when he finished, but he did not think he did anything wrong.”
Indeed, when queried about it by the media, Zarco himself did not accept blame.
“I was confident with the front, in this corner 9, I could attack,” Zarco said. “Then he tried to stay on the outside, but when I went out of the corner, I was not seeing him, thinking that maybe he can be there.
“We touch because on acceleration he went normally on my line and we touched each other. Because I was inside, I got a disadvantage.”
Lorenzo was among the pre-race favourites at Motegi, but finished over 24 seconds behind race-winning teammate Andrea Dovizioso – an outcome he described as a “real shame”.
He added: “The expectation was much higher than this position, 24 seconds from the winner. There was too much water on the track for our setting, didn't have confidence.
“Also Michelin, for safety reasons, avoid us to use the medium front, you had to use the harder one, also this affected me a little bit because I brake a little bit more smooth than [Marc] Marquez and Dovizioso, for example.
“I needed more grip on the rear. With not so much water, I was ready to fight for the win but with the lot of rivers and water, I wasn't competitive.
“And even if I tried to warm up the tyres, it's not possible, [they] didn't get enough temperature during all the race.”

Did it work out? What are some not-obvious positives and negatives? Did it meet your expectations? Would you recommend it? How did you manage things like taxes, wills, insurance, health concerns, joint finances, schedules, priorities? Did you feel "really married"? Was it ultimately good or bad for your relationship? What do you wish you'd known before not moving in together?
But feel free to just sound off about what you think is most important.
Talk to me about being married, but choosing to live apart. It sounds... awesome, for so many reasons. And I have heard that people do this. But I don't know any real people who have done it. If you or someone you know has this type of relationship, i'd like to know more about your experience. Examples of the type of stuff I want to know is:
Frankly speaking, I wasn't aware of International Women's Day until about a few years ago. Only when I started seeing a lot of offers, discounts and schemes being announced by businesses about the same and then a thought occurred to me -- Is it about the women's cause or is it about the business? Time, and again, the answer kept coming back to me that it is all about business under the guise of women's cause.
Today, also being International Women's Day, while I was driving to work, I saw poor women on roads, struggling and working hard to make ends meet and I thought, instinctively, where is celebration of women's day contributing for the upliftment of such women. And not only, women, even poor men have a tough life or I would say tougher life.
What I feel is that celebrating International Women's Day is all about educated women getting one more excuse not to work, to wear fancy clothes and get pampered without reason. And the thought of giving women a day off is gaining ground; what with even Prime Minister Narendra Modi mulling the thought of declaring 8th March as a national holiday. If that happens, that would be preposterous.
Since, I work with abused, victimized and distressed men and run a community center called Confidare to help them, often people ask me - Do you think celebrating women's day affects men adversely?
I have thought a lot about this and the more I think about it, Uncle Ben from the superhero series - Spider-Man keeps coming to me with his classic one liner - "With great power comes great responsibility"
We all keep hearing a lot of discourse about women's rights but where do we hear any discourse about women's responsibilities. When, we don't remind women of their responsibilities we end up eulogizing and pampering undeserving women who are abusive and at the same time we trivialize the issues faced by men.
Very recently, the famous case of Rohtak Sisters of November 2014 was in news once again as the girls lost the case since the boys were acquitted by the court based on lack of evidence and eye witness statements. For starters, in November 2014, two girls (sisters) from Rohtak shot to instant fame after they publicly assaulted 3 boys with belts accusing them of molestation but in reality, the fight was over seats.
The boys had asked the girls to vacate seat for an elderly woman upon which the girls got infuriated. One of the girls started creating a ruckus that she was molested by the boys and the other one started filming a video of the boys getting beaten up. In no time, the innocent boys were criminals. Their appointments in army were canceled immediately and they were defamed across the country. And now, after almost 2.5 years, the boys are declared innocent.
So, the moot question remains is, how to reinstate the life of the young boys ruined by these two girls and what punishment is these girls going to get for their heinous act of publicly assaulting innocent boys and making a criminal out of them. And the other important question is, what are we doing on women's day to contain the devastation caused by such abusive and criminal minded women?
When we celebrate women's day and only talk about the greatness of women, we are sparing such women who not only take advantage of being a woman but also ruin other men's lives for the sake of pampering their fragile ego and vulnerable insecurities.
Celebrating women's day and highlighting issues faced by women trivialises similar issues faced by men because men go through domestic violence, sexual violence, economic violence and the worst part is, there is no recognition of the problem itself from the social perspective, let alone a remedy being there.
Since, feminism claims itself to be a movement of gender equality, true equality will be achieved only when International Men's Day is also celebrated with equal zeal and we hear the Prime Minister talking about declaring that as a national holiday as well.
Till then, celebration of International Women's Day is all about validating male bashing.

Traveling to outer space is an exercise in efficiency. At $10,000 per pound onboard, it pays to keep things light. But space is also an incredibly complex environment, requiring tons of hefty equipment just to exit the atmosphere. To minimize the weight of its payload, NASA has experimented with inflatable materials that can balloon into habitats, and tangles of lightweight rods that can shift shape on different terrains. Now, designers at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory have developed a foldable fabric that could pull triple duty during outer space missions.
Researchers at JPL spent the last two years developing a metallic space fabric made of interlocking stainless steel squares. It looks like chain mail, but unlike the ancient armor, NASA's fabric isn't welded together. Instead a 3-D printer extrudes stainless steel as a continuous sheet of material with different properties on each side. From the front of the fabric, rows of shiny, flat squares can reflect heat and light. On the back, a series of interlocking loops help the fabric absorb heat. Together, the single piece of material acts like a super-strong shield, protecting astronauts and spacecrafts from outer orbit's deadly obstacles.
The fabric isn't special in its functionality, per se; NASA already employs materials on its spacecrafts to reflect heat, absorb heat, and protect from flying debris. But until now, NASA didn't have a single material that could do all three. “We wanted to see if a structure could do something beyond being a static piece of material,” says Raul Polit Casillas, a systems engineer at JPL who worked on the new fabric.
NASA/JPL-Caltech
NASA could bake multiple properties into the single material thanks to 4-D printing, a burgeoning manufacturing technique that uses a 3-D printer to layer multiple textures and geometries into a single design. MIT researcher Skylar Tibbits coined the phrase several years ago to show how a 4-D printed material could shape-shift or self-assemble. Using 4-D printing, for instance, engineers could program a piece of metal to unfold at a certain heat or design a plastic to expand or contract under certain environmental conditions. Or, in the case of NASA's space fabric, a fabric with flexible geometry that can both reflect and radiate heat.
Unlike sheets of metal, the chain mail can bend and fold with little effort while still remaining strong. This makes it a valuable material onboard a spacecraft full of stiff, hard materials. Polit Casillas says astronauts could print the material onboard the spacecraft and use it to deflect heat on deployable components like antennas and reflectors. It could just as easily be used on missions to Jupiter's moon Europa, where the rough side would act like tire treads on the moon's icy surface, or as armor for astronauts and vessels.
“Of course," Polit Casillas adds, "you could use this for fashion, too.”
NASA is still at the beginning stages of its 4-D printing explorations, but Polit Casillas expects that his team will eventually develop materials with more advanced built-in capabilities. Soon, you might see fabrics that move electrons, transfer energy, and shape shift. The point, he says, is to “increase the science we can do per kilogram.” Doing more with less doesn't always result in the best product, but in this case, it lends itself to some very cool science.
In a too-strange-to-be-true twist on an already bizarre crime story, fugitive tech millionaire John McAfee today revealed where he'd been hiding over the last six days: in his own compound. McAfee, wanted by police in connection with the murder of his neighbor Gregory Faull over the weekend, said in a phone interview that he had never really been on the run at all. He'd just been hiding out at home. The calls were coming from inside the house!
"I am," he said in a telephone interview Friday afternoon, "where I am most of the time. I am certainly inside my compound."

The revelation came at the end of a week of intense international media attention which began when I broke the story on Gizmodo.com Monday. McAfee, who has bragged about the delight he takes in hoaxing the press, had managed to control the coverage of his story by doling out a carefully measured flow of misinformation to an eager press corps, many of whom were camped right outside his house as he spoke to them from within one of the numerous outbuildings on the property, unaware of his presence within.
The truth of McAfee's location did not come as a shock to some of his neighbors. "If I had to guess, I'd say he's in his house," one of his neighbors told me on Wednesday, adding: "He's such a media whore, he's probably loving it."

McAfee bought the property after his arrival in Belize in 2008, and proceeded to build a number of outbuildings. Apparently they contained at least one difficult-to-detect shelter or safe room, because local police reportedly searched the property after Faull's murder without managing to find him. A source who lived on McAfee's compound in Colorado told me that he had built a shelter on that property, too.
McAfee's property on the coastal island of Ambergris Caye is less than 50 miles from Mexico, and it would be a fairly straightforward matter to travel by boat across the border. But McAfee's behavior made it clear that he hadn't gone far. Almost as soon as the story broke, he began an intensive series of communications with Wired magazine reporter Joshua Davis, who published McAfee's often outlandish claims without qualification. Within days he was conducting phone interviews with other news outlets as well, and posting on internet message boards. The uninterrupted communication suggested that he was not in transit. (Today he debuted a blog.) The uninterrupted flow of communication suggested that he was not, say, riding a mule through a Central American swamp.
Ambergris Caye is a long, thin island, with the population spread out along about 10 miles of beachfront. Much of that distance is traversed by only a single rutted dirt track. It would have been difficult for McAfee to travel along it without being noticed, and even harder to travel within the community by boat. What's more, McAfee's increasingly erratic behavior has left him feared and loathed by his fellow expatriates; he is no Robin Hood who could melt effortlessly into the citizenry. For a man who has boasted of taking large quantities of psychosis- and paranoia-inducing "bath salts," the comforts of home no doubt seemed preferable to a peripatetic existence. At least one girlfriend remained on the property during the week, and news reports described employees continuing to show up for work.

At time of writing, it is not clear what, if anything, Belize authorities will do now that they know McAfee's location. The reporters to whom McAfee disclosed his location, Brian Sullivan and Robert Frank of CNBC, did not press him to reveal further details of how he managed to hide out in his own home.
UPDATE 10:12AM Saturday 11/17/12: I called Belize police spokesman Raphael Martinez this morning, and he said that he would check with the local San Pedro police to see if they had followed up on McAfee's claim. While I was waiting for his reply, Foxnews.com reporter Jeremy Kaplan managed to reach him, and was told by Martinez that the information "has been passed on to the police in San Pedro... They are checking it out right now." I have also emailed McAfee to ask why he revealed his location to CNBC, and what he thought of their failure to recognize the significance of his answer, but McAfee has not yet replied.
UPDATE 5:20pm Saturday 11/17/12: Belize police spokesman Raphael Martinez reports that officers from the San Pedro force again visited McAfee's Ambergris Caye today and "nobody was found there." Said Martinez, "We're back at square one."

With the NHL's April 3rd trade deadline rapidly approaching, the Blackhawks are rumored to be in on a number of players.
A second line center is the number one need. Also, when Jarome Iginla lists you as one of the teams he's being willing to accept a trade to, you have to kick the tires.
If the Blackhawks do add a top six forward, center or wing, they have a log jam up front.
Let's take a look at potential lines after a trade (assuming health):
Saad-Toews-Hossa Sharp-New Center-Kane Bickell-Bolland-Shaw Carcillo/Bollig-Kruger-Frolik/Stalberg OR Saad-Toews-Hossa Sharp-Bolland-Kane Bickell-Shaw-Iginla/other winger Carcillo/Bollig-Kruger-Frolik/Stalberg
Either way, Viktor Stalberg ends up on the 4th line. Sure, that gives the Hawks four lines with legit scoring prowess, but Stalberg is an offensive forward. Asking him to play a 4th line role destroys exactly what has made the Hawks so successful this season : guys playing in their proper roles.
Stalberg is also due a contract at the end of this season. If they don't move him, the Hawks would have to find a way to bring back Stalberg, Bryan Bickell and Nick Leddy, all while balancing a reduced salary cap next season. The Hawks have to make a choice on one of those three. Bickell will come cheap and Leddy is a key to the future. That makes Stalberg the odd man out. Obviously, his pending free agency hurts his value to a potential suitor, but if a team identifies him as a guy they could trade for and sign long term, he could be the final piece of a bigger trade.
If he's not used as part of a big deal, the Hawks could deal him to a team deep at center or defense, but weak at wing.
There are a lot of possibilities in a potential deal. Of course, this is all meaningless if Stan Bowman doesn't deal for a top six forward.
As much as I've loved watching "Dream Weaver" develop into a legit goal scorer, it just makes sense to move him in a deal.
When will Apple ship a MacBook with an ARM processor? This is a question that has been top of mind for observers of the company ever since it started designing and building its own chips from the ground up.
The answer to that question is now, sort of. Apple's new 13” and 15” MacBook Pro models come equipped with a Touch Bar – that bar and the accompanying Touch ID sensor are powered by both the Intel processor at the core of the laptop and an Apple designed T1 chip. That T1 is the same chip that is inside the S2 in the new Series 2 Apple Watch.
The T1 consists of the processor in the Apple Watch's S2 and the Secure Enclave.
As noted by Apple in its keynote, handles security for the Touch ID sensor, but it also performs a variety of other tasks. It secures the camera, the keychain which stores your passwords and the Touch Bar.
Some of these details were posited yesterday by developer Steven Troughton-Smith. I was able to get more details and expansion on the nature of the T1 and more of its functionality from some of my sources.
The T1 also sends pixels to the Touch Bar though the MacBook's main processor is what actually renders that content which is then sent over. The touch events on the Touch Bar are driven completely by Mac OS X – making this the first component that takes advantage of macOS's touch support.
Though transmission of data is handled by the main processor, Apple Pay dialogs on screen are completely rendered by the T1 to take advantage of the Secure Enclave, a portion of the chip set aside for personal information just as it is in iPhones and Apple Watch devices.
The Touch Bar itself runs a lean, modified version of watchOS, likely because that's what the T1 needs to run it, send data and render images.
What Apple is doing with this hybrid configuration is very interesting. Instead of ‘switching' to ARM chips, it chose to build custom chips for a precise task and use them specifically for it. Just as the Intel chip is good at the heavy, multi-threaded lifting of OS X, the T1 was made for the security of Touch ID and the lightweight lifting of rendering Apple Pay dialogs securely.
This specialized chip approach is one we've seen with the motion coprocessor in the iPhone, but it also makes a ton of sense on MacBooks, where specialized tasks are better handled by specialized tools.
What other things are enabled by this onboard T1 in the future will be interesting to see. I'm also more sure than ever that an ARM-powered keyboard for iMacs and Mac Pros with Touch ID built in is on the way, soon.
Loaded Chicken Taco Salad with Creamy Lime-Cilantro Dressing
I have fond memories of my mom making tacos a few times a month when I was growing up.
The smell of taco seasoning wafting through the air signaled I was in for a feast.
I've also been to plenty of potlucks and parties where ‘taco salad' is served but there's an absence of any lettuce other than a few shreds of iceberg. In place of the lettuce there are thick layers of sour cream, cream cheese, cheese, guacamole, and refried beans topped with tortilla chips. Not exactly a skinny ‘salad'.
For this recipe I brought the lettuce back into salad and loaded it with all my favorite taco fixing. There's juicy chicken cooked with the comforting flavors of taco seasoning, juicy tomatoes and corn, protein-packed chewy black beans, creamy avocado, salty cheese, and crunchy tortilla chips. So much texture and flavor in every bite.
If you have other vegetables like bell peppers, red onions, or black olives that you want to toss in, go for it. If you don't have something on hand or don't like it, omit. It's a flexible recipe.
I used canned corn and canned black beans from my local VONS store. A well-stocked cantry helps you save time and make nutritious, flavorful, healthy meals you can feel good about serving.
The 30-second whisk-together dressing can be made as mild, spicy, and tart as desired. I love limes and am a huge cilantro fan and add plenty but adjust to taste. Extra works beautifully as a veggie dip.
The salad is ready in 15 minutes, great for easy lunches, or as a healthier dinner the whole family will love.

1 1/4 pounds boneless skinless chicken breasts, cut into bite-sized pieces
one 1.25-ounce packet taco seasoning, divided (I use reduced sodium, medium heat)
4 cups romaine lettuce
1 or 2 medium tomatoes, diced (I use vine-ripened; Roma or cherry tomatoes may be substituted)
1/2 cup canned corn, drained (fresh or frozen may be substituted)
1/2 cup canned black beans, drained and rinsed
1 medium Hass avocado, peeled and diced
1 cup shredded cheese (I use a monterey Jack and cheddar blend)
1 cup seasoned tortilla chips, crushed (I crush Doritos in my palm)
1/2 cup mayonnaise (lite okay)
1/4 cup sour cream (lite okay, plain Greek yogurt may be substituted)
3 to 4 tablespoons lime juice, or as necessary for flavor and consistency
1/4 cup cilantro leaves, minced
1/2 teaspoon granulated sugar, optional and to taste Directions: To a large skillet, add the olive oil, chicken, evenly sprinkle with 1 heaping tablespoon taco seasoning, and cook over medium-high heat for about 5 minutes, flipping intermittently so all sides cook evenly. Cooking time will vary based on thickness of chicken breasts and sizes of pieces. Allow chicken to rest in pan off the heat while you assemble the salad. To a large platter, add the lettuce, and evenly sprinkle with the tomatoes, corn, black beans, avocado, cheese, tortilla chips, and chicken; set aside. To a small bowl, add the mayo, sour cream, lime juice, 1 heaping tablespoon taco seasoning, and whisk to combine. Add the cilantro and stir to incorporate. Add additional lime juice to thin out dressing if desired. Taste dressing and depending on how much lime juice was used, add sugar to taste. Evenly drizzle dressing over salad. Extra dressing will keep airtight for up to 5 days in the fridge and makes a great veggie dip. Only Eats Recipe from Averie Cooks. All images and content are copyright protected.

Dayton lays out opposition to proposed Twin Metals mine near BWCA
Updated: March 8, 6:25 a.m. | Posted: March 7, 7:19 p.m.
Just a few days after the state signed off on the environmental review of the proposed PolyMet copper-nickel mine, Gov. Mark Dayton has announced he opposes mining near the Boundary Waters Canoe Area. Twin Metals Minnesota wants to build a huge underground mine near Ely.
In the letter to Twin Metals Chief Operating Officer Ian Duckworth, Dayton said he has "grave concerns about the use of state surface lands for mining-related activities in close proximity to the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness."
He's directed the Department of Natural Resources "not to authorize or enter into any new access or lease agreements for mining operations" there. In the letter, Dayton said he has an "obligation to ensure (the BWCA area) is not diminished in any way," and that he's "unwilling to take risks with that Minnesota environmental icon."
Becky Rom with Northeastern Minnesotans for Wilderness said the governor's letter is meaningful.
"It's a big deal because he is saying that the Boundary Waters is too important to put at risk," Rom said. "This type of industrial mining has never been done without polluting water."
Twin Metals wants to mine rich copper and nickel deposits that are bound in rock containing sulfide. When that rock is exposed to air and water, it can create sulfuric acid drainage that can leach heavy metals into waterways.
Rom and others argue the Superior National Forest just south of the BWCA is the wrong place for that scale of environmental development.
"The governor agrees. He views the Boundary Waters as a national treasure," Rom said. "It's iconic. It's incredibly important to Minnesota, and he's decided this is simply the wrong place for a sulfide ore mine."
In a statement Twin Metals said it received Dayton's letter late Monday afternoon and is "currently assessing the Governor's position."
But Frank Ongaro, executive director with Mining Minnesota, said the letter raises great concern.
"This calls into serious question the governor and the state honoring contractual agreements of state mineral leases that one company or a variety of companies already have and are paying money for rent on those leases to the state of Minnesota," Ongaro said.
For the past decade Twin Metals has been exploring for copper, nickel and precious metals near Birch Lake and the South Kawishiwi River, about 15 miles southeast of Ely.
The company has forecasted that an underground mine could operate for 30 years and employ 850 people. Twin Metals had planned to spend $2.8 billion to construct the mine. The company has said it is a year or more away from submitting a plan to the state that would start the environmental review process.
Owned by a giant Chilean mining company, Antofagasta, Twin Metals holds a variety of mineral leases on private, state and federal land. The governor's letter only affects state land. But Ongaro said it still would have a big impact.
"If you take any one of them off the table and make it prohibitive, you've really made it difficult for mineral development," he said. "You just don't develop 40 acres of state minerals that might be next to 40 acres of federal minerals. Those are all part of an overall patchwork puzzle that needs to be looked at for overall development opportunities and commercial viability."
Ongaro said he still needs clarification on what broader impacts the letter might have. It also potentially affects several other companies exploring in the Boundary Waters watershed.
Critics of the PolyMet mining proposal also contend that polluted water from that project could flow north toward the BWCA, although the DNR disputes that.
Dayton said the federal government will offer further guidance on the future of mining in the area. Twin Metals has applied to the Bureau of Land Management to renew two federal mineral leases and is awaiting its decision. Dayton said he told the BLM's director last week of his strong opposition to mining in close proximity to the Boundary Waters.
A macro story
This is a story about a real macro used by a number of programmers at the Institute for the Learning Sciences for years. It is an example of how not to design and implement a macro.
The creator of the macro was an adept Lisp programmer. He understood how macros worked, how to use backquote to define them, and so on.
The Problem
A demo of a fairly mature program crashed. Nothing major had been added to it, but a programmer had finished cleaning up its code. After a fair amount of bug hunting, the programmer found the change that broke the code. In essence, he had replaced
(defmacro my-wait-for (n) `(wait-for ,n))
with the seemingly more direct
(defun my-wait-for (n) (wait-for n))
But, with the new version, (my-wait-for 12) never waited! Why not?
The Cause of the Problem
The problem lay not with my-wait-for , but the macro it called, wait-for . There were three ways to use it:
(wait-for 12) waits for 12 seconds ( wait-for #'foo) calls (foo) until it returns a non-NIL value (wait-for (baz x y)) evaluates (baz x y) until it returns a non-NIL value
The macro version of my-wait-for expanded (my-wait-for 12) into (wait-for 12) , which fits the first calling format.
The function version of my-wait-for , on the other hand, calls (wait-for n) , with n = 12. This fits the third calling format, and is interpreted as "wait until the expression n is non-NIL." Since n is already non-NIL, no waiting occurs.
The Cause of the Cause of the Problem
(wait-for 12) looks like a function call. It looks like it evaluates its argument. But it is not. It looks at the argument form to decide what to do.
wait-for is a macro because its designer violated the principle "one function to a function." He tried to do three waiting tasks with one interface.
Unfortunately, the first task, "wait for number seconds," shares a common calling format with the third task, "wait for expression to be non-NIL." The rule "do the first task only if the number is explicitly given" is not intuitive, easy to forget, and a pain to live with. For example, it makes it impossible to say
(wait-for *default-wait-period*)
The Fix
The fix is not to write a comment that says "use only literal numbers for wait times." Where would the comment go? If we put it on the definition, it won't be seen by someone modifying a call to wait-for . And it's pretty unlikely that programmers using wait-for will remember to put a comment on every call to wait-for that says "don't replace this number with a variable!"
Nor is it to change wait-for to evaluate its argument and, if the result is a number, do the first task, otherwise do the third. First, this rule counts on programmers knowing and remembering that, in wait-for , unlike elsewhere in Lisp, a number is not treated like other non-NIL values. Second, exactly what is the rule? If exp in (wait-for exp) returns nil the first few times, and then returns 3 , is that a signal to stop waiting or a signal to wait three more seconds?
Rescue workers lift a piece of fuselage out of the water
Russian investigators looking into a military plane which crashed into the Black Sea believe it was caused by a fault with the aircraft's wing flaps, according to reports.
A black box was found in the wreckage of the plane, which had 92 people on board when it plunged into the sea on Sunday.
The device is the first flight data recorder to be recovered from the Tu-154 jet, which came down two minutes after taking off from Sochi airport.
It will be sent to Moscow for analysis, a defence ministry official told TASS news agency.
According to the Interfax news agency, a second black box has been found in the wreckage but not yet raised to the surface.
Image: The flight data recorder was placed in metal cooking pot
All 84 passengers and eight crew members were killed in the crash, including dozens of singers in Russia's world-famous military choir who were on their way to Syria to entertain troops.
Russia's federal security service said it had "no signs or facts" to suggest the crash was an act of terror.
An investigation is focusing on pilot error, a technical fault, bad fuel and a foreign object in the engine as four possible causes.
Russia has grounded all its Tu-154 jets until it is known what brought down the aircraft.
Search teams find fragments of crashed Russian plane
The Russian defence ministry said the plane that crashed was built in 1983 and underwent factory check-ups and maintenance in 2014.
Search and rescue teams have recovered 12 bodies and 156 body fragments, it added.
On Monday, rescue workers recovered the plane's fuselage and brought it to shore.
Fragments of the jet were found 27 metres underwater, including "two elements of the plane's control mechanism".
More than 3,000 people and 27 ships have been involved in the search operation.
The federal investigation into McDonald's use of temporary foreign workers has widened to several other locations, as more local workers speak out about feeling sidelined and shortchanged.
“I feel it's definitely discrimination against Canadians,” said Chris Eldridge, from Lethbridge, Alta.
Eldridge just quit his managerial job for six McDonald's locations in Alberta, because he said he could no longer stomach denying local employees much-needed shifts to accommodate temporary foreign workers.
“Honestly, some days I wonder, is this still Canada? Everyone is supposed to have equal rights.”
Former McDonald's manager Chris Eldridge did employee schedules for six franchise locations in Lethbridge. He said he was told to give full time shifts first to the foreign workers, who he said were paid more than locals, too. (CBC)
Eldridge was a manager who did the worker scheduling for McDonald's franchisee Dan Brown. He's also upset about differences in pay. Many foreign workers started at $10.80 an hour, he said, while local employees doing the same job made less.
Federal rules stipulate that foreign workers coming in to Lethbridge as food service attendants must make at least the "prevailing wage" of $10.41. However, immigration lawyers told Go Public local employees doing the same job are not supposed to be paid less or lose hours as a result.
“I was instructed to ensure, based on the contracts the foreign workers had signed, that they would be guaranteed full-time hours, no questions asked,” said Eldridge, who said that meant he had to shortchange Canadian employees.
Federal investigators dispatched
As a result of our inquiries, Employment Minister Jason Kenney's office said the “urgent investigation” launched last week after Go Public's story about a Victoria McDonald's franchise has been expanded.
"Minister Kenney has expressed strong concerns about the potential abuse of the Temporary Foreign Worker Program to the head of human resources at McDonald's' head office," said a spokesperson from the minister's office.
The minister's office said franchises in Lethbridge and Parksville B.C. have been barred from applying to bring in any more temporary foreign workers, pending the outcome of the investigation.
"As soon as we became aware of these allegations, officials were directed to begin an urgent and immediate investigation. These cases are being investigated as urgently as the previous case in Victoria, including inspectors being dispatched," said Kenney's office.
The minister's office said those additional franchisees have not been put on the department's blacklist, however, only because they don't have any current applications in the works.
“I was told [foreign workers] have better flexibility, they're willing to do whatever they're asked,” said Eldridge. “Because they were these amazing workers, they were given these [better] shifts.”
Brown owns six Alberta fast food outlets in Lethbridge, one in Pincher Creek and one in Taber. He confirmed he has 90 temporary foreign workers on staff.

He denies telling Eldridge to cut local employee hours. However, Eldridge said his instructions came from other managers,who said they were speaking on Brown's behalf. He said some local employees didn't get enough work to pay their rent.
“I was constantly having that guilt on my chest, because I could be the reason someone might lose the place that they're living in.”
Brown confirmed part-time local staffers make $9.95 per hour – less than the foreign workers — but he said full-timers are paid equally. He said full-time hours are now split evenly between local and foreign staff.
“I provide people with an opportunity to live and work in Canada and contribute to the Canadian economy,” Brown said. “Temporary foreign workers in my restaurants are very grateful for the opportunity.”
Foreigners live in 'compound'
Eldridge said the foreign workers were recruited from Belize, the Philippines and Jamaica by Actyl Group, an international recruiter used by McDonald's Canada. It charges employers up to $2,000 per worker it recruits.
Actyl's job website is designed to attract foreign workers. It lists numerous ads for full-time jobs at McDonald's.
This housing complex in Lethbridge is referred to as 'the compound.' Local McDonald's employees said up to eight foreign workers live in each suite and they pay the franchise owner $400 per month each for rent. (CBC)
Canadians can apply, but many of the open jobs currently on the Actyl site are not advertised on popular Canadian jobs sites like Kijiji. Linda West of Actyl said that is because those McDonald's locations already have government approvals to hire foreign workers.
"We never give up on trying to recruit Canadians," West said. "We have had adverts up for over a year without Canadians applying."
Eldridge said Brown houses the foreign workers in an apartment building with six to eight employees per unit, and deducts approximately $400 a month from each worker's pay for rent.
“It's a big apartment complex, but everyone calls it 'the compound.' It's so enclosed and overpacked in a lot of ways,” said Eldridge.
Go Public asked Brown if he is also the foreign workers' landlord, but he didn't answer.
Emily Bryce, who still works at one of his outlets, said she believes the foreigners are exploited because many are professionals by trade and leave their children behind for a chance to live in Canada.
“My Canada isn't one where you force people to choose between their job and their family. They should be taking full families in and giving them citizenship,” said Bryce.
The whole [foreign worker] program is unjust and it has too many loopholes in it for franchisee owners to exploit them.”
Locals feel marginalized nationwide
Go Public received complaints from McDonald's workers in other B.C. and Alberta locations, too, as well as Nova Scotia, New Brunswick and Newfoundland.
“The whole time I have worked at the local McDonald's there has been nothing but favouritism towards the Filipinos,” said a worker in New Brunswick. “Any Canadian that works here feels that if they were to complain it would be viewed racist, but it is a serious problem.”
Christina Morrow worked at a Parksville, B.C., McDonald's franchise for 24 years, but said she was pushed out when temporary foreign workers were brought in. (CBC)
“I've seen countless [local] people turned down [for] the chance to even submit resumes, or have the chance of their resumes to be looked at, before they enter the trash,” said an employee from a B.C. location.
An insider from Edmonton wrote, “Being a former general manager for McDonald's, I can tell you on the franchisee side of the business this is the preferred hiring method...There are numerous other franchisees in the system that will exclude hiring Canadians first."
Seventy five percent of McDonald's outlets in Canada are owned by franchisees.
A former assistant manager from a McDonald's in Parksville, B.C., who was there for 24 years, said she was effectively pushed out the door in favour of workers from the Philippines.
“All those of us who have left, you know, for sure have all felt pushed out,” said 52-year-old Christina Morrow. “It was reverse discrimination.”
Her former boss, Jamie Johannesen, owns four area franchises. Morrow said he brought in 20 foreign workers when he bought the Parksville location three years ago.
Filipinos 'better workers'
“He said they were better workers…so I would have to cut [local employee] hours to give these people 40 hours.”
Morrow said her work was criticized for the first time in two decades and her pay was cut from $18 to $11 an hour.
“It felt like a knife in my heart, she said. I'd been there 24 years…a lifetime to devote your flesh and blood to a position like that but obviously I wasn't wanted anymore.”
She quit a year ago, because she says she couldn't handle the pay cut.
Brayden Chamberlain quit his job at McDonald's in Parksville, because he said his hours were cut so much his job wasn't worth keeping. (CBC)
“I would say the foreign workers were definitely favoured in almost every aspect,” said 19-year-old Brayden Chamberlain, who worked at the same McDonald's for three years.
He quit last spring, because he said his hours had been cut so much it wasn't worth working there anymore. He said some of the Filipinos had management roles, which made local workers feel marginalized.
“They treat you a lot differently. You're the minority of the company and you almost end up
feeling exiled, which is why I ended up quitting,” he said. “If you are not Filipino, you have no place there.”
The owner, Johannesen, did not respond to requests for comment.
Go Public asked McDonald's Canada for comment on this story, but the company said it needed more time to investigate.
Corporate McDonald's responding
"We have begun the process of undertaking a comprehensive review, working closely with external advisers, of all our restaurants – franchised and corporate-owned – across Canada that employ temporary foreign workers," said McDonald's Canada spokesperson Richard Ellis.
McDonald's Canada said it is now doing a comprehensive review of all locations that use temporary foreign workers as a result of Go Public's reporting. (CBC)
"As you will appreciate, it will take a significant amount of time to do this right."
The company said earlier it has 3,400 temporary foreign workers in its 1,400 locations and it abides by all the rules of the federal program.
NDP employment critic Jinny Sims is calling for an emergency debate in Parliament and said the government should now suspend all temporary foreign worker permits for fast-food outlets.
“I believe this is an emergency,” said Sims. “This is creating unnecessary tension and the minister cannot wash his hands of this…his government is allowing this program to be abused.”

President Hassan Rouhani's Chief of Staff has announced that the Islamic Republic's parliament and judiciary have reached “a good consensus” over the controversial case of a Zoroastrian member of Yazd City Council.
The agreement permits the Zoroastrian member of Yazd city Council to attend its sessions until the law concerning participation of religious minorities is amended, state run Iran labor News Agency, ILNA cited Mahmoud Vaezi as saying, on Wednesday, November 8.
Sepanta Niknam, 32, is the first Zoroastrian who has served as a city councilor in Yazd and the only non-Muslim in all city councils in Iran. However, he was suspended after serving a 4-year full term, and re-elected this year.
The Court of Administrative Justice led by the head of the judiciary, ultra conservative ayatollah Sadiq Amoli Larijani ordered the Governor of Yazd to suspend the Niknam's membership, after an administrative court decision.
This was prompted by criticism from some of the Guardian Council's ultra-conservative members who insisted that a non-Muslim cannot be a member of a body which makes decisions about Muslims.
But this led to a constitutional disagreement. Parliament is the body allowed by law to supervise local Councils – not courts or the Guardian Council.
But now parliament and the Judiciary have stepped in with an agreement to solve the issue, at least temporarily.
Vaezi, who was speaking at the end of a cabinet session, also maintained that Rouhani's government is in favor of the joint decision by the parliament and judiciary o allow Niknam to serve.
Earlier, it was said that Rouhani has personally written a letter to the Supreme Leader, ayatollah Khamenei, seeking his position vis-à-vis the controversial case.
The Speaker of Parliament Ali Larijani had also written a letter to the Islamic Republic's judiciary, requested permission for Niknam to attend the city council sessions until the law concerning the procedure of religious minorities' participation in Iranian elections is amended.
According the Islamic Republic's Constitution, officially recognized members of religious minorities, Zoroastrianism, Judaism and Christianity are free to nominate themselves as candidates for local elections.
However, the Court of Administrative Justice cancelled the democratically elected Zoroastrian's membership in Yazd's City Council, while he had already served a 4-year full term and got re-elected this year.
The head of Yazd city council, Gholam Ali Sefid and several other members of the council have come to Niknam's rescue. They have announced that they will resign from their posts if the suspension is not revoked.
The conservative court's decision was prompted by a complaint from a rival, Ali Asghar Bagheri, who was one of Niknam's opponents in last May's elections.
Niknam garnered more than 20,000 votes, ranked 7th and kept his seat in Yazd city council, while Bagheri, with only 7707 votes, ranked 45th and was left out of the eleven-member council.
Some members of parliament recently announced the possibility of changes in the law, which might limit the impact of minorities on elections or even bar Muslims from voting for minority candidates.
In Iran, City Council elections, contrary to presidential and parliamentary elections are not supervised by the influential Guardian Council chaired by the 90-year old ultra conservative ayatollah Ahmad Jannati. It is parliament's responsibility to supervise city council elections.
The Islamic Republic's judiciary has not yet reacted to President Rouhani's comments on the agreement reached between the speaker of the parliament, Ali Larijani and his younger brother, the head of judiciary, ayatollah Sadeq Amoli Larijani.

Residents are urged to call OCPD if you recognize the men.PHOTO: People wanted in connection with homicide“At this point we're still trying to piece together exactly what led up to this shooting,” Jennifer Wardlow, with the Oklahoma City Police Department, said.PHOTO: People wanted in connection with homicide 2Police confirm that Lam has been arrested multiple times and say that his death probably wasn't random.“Drug charges; I think the majority (of arrests) were drug charges,” Wardlow said. “We don't want anyone who lives in this neighborhood to believe this was just some random act of violence where they need to be concerned for their safety. We do believe this was an isolated incident."Neighbors told KOCO what happened before police arrived.“I just heard three guys arguing, and next thing you know three gunshots,” one man said. “It's kind of terrifying, knowing this can happen in anybody's neighborhood.”At this time, police don't have any suspects and have made no arrests.
Andrew Poole said there was a barbecue to celebrate his birthday Action to prevent an "illegal rave" in Devon last week has been defended by police, despite claims the event was merely an organised birthday barbecue. Locals feared a rave was to take place at Sowton, near Exeter, on Saturday and called the police, who closed the event down. A force helicopter was deployed. Andrew Poole, who was celebrating his 30th birthday, claimed police riot vans turned up before any music was played. But police said it had been advertised on the internet as an all-night party. Mr Poole, a coach driver from Sowton, said 15 family and friends had come to the event, where they were watched by a police helicopter for about 15 minutes. What effectively the police did was come in and stop 15 people eating burgers
Andrew Poole He said before they had turned on the music, four police cars and a riot van arrived and demanded the barbecue was shut down and everyone leaves. The event was closed down under section 63 of the Criminal justice and Public Order Act 1994. "We were nowhere near anyone, we weren't even playing any music," he said. "What effectively the police did was come in and stop 15 people eating burgers." Devon and Cornwall police said the helicopter flew over the site as it returned from another task. 'Appropriate steps' A police spokeswoman said the helicopter was deployed for less than 20 minutes at a cost of about £200. "The decision to close down a rave or illegal music festival is not taken lightly," a police spokeswoman said. "On this occasion, we were extremely concerned how the event had been advertised on the internet as an all-night party and it was therefore necessary to take the appropriate steps. "Had it gone ahead, it is likely that far more of our resources would have been used to police the event and there would have been considerable disruption to neighbouring properties.

A fresh workplace accident led a Spanish man to be admitted into hospital with a completely new disease borne of pigs.
The 53-year-old man, who was employed to collect hazardous laboratory waste, was admitted to Zaragoza's Miguel Servet University Hospital in 2014, suffering from fever, joint discomfort and headaches.
An examination revealed he was suffering from a type of pig brucellosis, caused by a strain of bacteria which exists in only a handful of laboratories around the globe, El Pais reports.
The man is believed to have contracted the illness while collecting waste from the Centre for Research and Agro-Food Technology of Aragon, whose students were studying the strain for a doctoral thesis.
He is thought to have accidently stepped on a contaminated syringe which punctured the sole of his boots. The needle should have been hermetically sealed, but its box somehow opened.
To add an even more improbable element to the story, the man suffered from an autoimmune disorder which inflamed his blood vessels and left him vulnerable to infection.
Doctors believe this is the first case in the world of an individual suffering from this strain of the bacteria. Regional governor Jose Maria Blasco Martinez said "it was like an airplane accident, the accumulation of a series of circumstances."
The man eventually overcame the disease with the help of antibiotics, but since the news became public, researchers have called for more stringent safety protocols to prevent similar occurrences.

In the race to fully energize India, renewables are beating coal.
That is one of the most surprising findings in the new report Financing India's Clean Energy Transition, which was researched and written by Bloomberg New Energy Finance with support from the David and Lucile Packard Foundation. According to the report, released earlier this month, renewable capacity (not including large hydro) is being added at a quicker clip in India than that of its dirty competitor. In fact, renewables have posted a cumulative compound annual growth rate of 15 percent, compared to 12.5 percent for coal power plants between fiscal years 2013 and 2016.
In some respects, the rapid deployment of clean energy in India -- particularly solar, which is besting wind and other renewables -- shouldn't be a huge surprise. After all, India's clean energy goals are so ambitious that fast growth is absolutely necessary if the nation has any chance of achieving them. Indeed, Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government has targeted the construction of 175 gigawatts of renewable energy by 2022. In addition, the government has mandated the rapid electrification of more than 18,000 villages. At the end of fiscal year 2016, India had a total of 42.6 gigawatts of installed clean energy capacity, which amounts to 14 percent of the country's overall generation capacity.
Ambitious targets that provide over 300 million people the many benefits that come from reliable access to clean electricity is clearly an important starting point. But as the report's authors point out, there are important challenges to overcome, particularly around financing this clean energy revolution, which is estimated to represent a $150 billion investment opportunity. While government policy is vital for India to reach its clean energy goals, the country's financial markets and outside investors will need to play a major role.
Financial challenges and opportunities
To untangle the financing challenges and opportunities in India, the report's authors divided the clean energy sector into four distinct categories: utility-scale projects, which are defined as 1 megawatt and larger; small and rooftop solar, defined as ranging between 1 kilowatt and 1 megawatt in size; small energy grids between 100 watts and 50 kilowatts; and solar home systems and lanterns 100 watts and smaller. Some of the issues raised by the report in each category are outlined below.
Utility-scale projects
Put simply, large clean energy installations are already being financed and built in India at a fairly rapid pace. Driven largely by the government's goal to install 175 gigawatts by 2022, investments have flowed in from foreign and domestic sources to support construction. The report's authors note that asset financing has grown by nearly $4 billion -- from $6.6 billion to $10.5 billion -- between fiscal years 2014 and 2016. Despite that vigorous level of activity, the financing required in the years ahead is substantial.
The report's authors believe it will require a total of $100 billion in asset finance, including $30 billion in equity capital, between 2016 and 2022 for India to reach its target of 135 gigawatts of installed utility-scale projects. The financing challenges involved with reaching this goal include the fact that India has the highest cost of capital in the Asia-Pacific region. Reducing those costs will be critical in order to encourage the scale of investments necessary. Also important, particularly to foreign investors, is improving the ease of doing business in India. Domestically, policy changes and innovations that make it easier for institutional investors to back renewable energy are important.
Already, there is some important movement to scale up the required investment, including the use of green bonds to raise debt and refinance projects. The report's authors also note that infrastructure investment trusts -- a version of the YieldCos used in the U.S. market -- are advancing as well. “The idea is that investor interest is protected and developers can quickly recycle equity in large commissioned projects by selling it to long-term institutional and retail investors seeking lower, but stable, returns,” wrote the authors. “These structures have started to attract increased interest after a series of regulatory amendments made them more palatable, and could be crucial for the estimated $30 billion equity that the utility-scale projects need.”
Small and rooftop solar
Only a few years ago, there was essentially no small and rooftop solar development in India whatsoever. But demand from commercial and industrial customers has led to an annual CAGR of 92 percent over the past four years and cumulative installations of 500 megawatts. This rapid deployment has a straightforward explanation: compelling economics. Commercial and industrial customers that have sufficient cash have embraced solar as a replacement for expensive diesel generators many use for backup power in places where grid-tied electricity is spotty. The short payback time that comes with making the switch to solar has been the primary driver of small and rooftop solar, although the implementation of net metering in most Indian states could also contribute to more installations.
But in order to reach the government's 40-gigawatt solar target, India will have to have a cumulative CAGR of 108 percent over the next six years. Unlocking third-party financing will be critical, as will an overall maturation of a financing industry able to meet the demand for small and rooftop solar. There is some movement in this direction, the report's authors say.
“Various international agencies are committing new funding for the small solar segment to their partner banks/non-banking financial companies in India,” according to the report. “The following steps can go a long way toward ensuring further growth in the sector: educating long disbursement agencies and creating standardized loan application review processes; establishing and propagating norms for quality controls of products; pilot studies to measure the technical and commercial impact of high penetration of rooftop solar on host power distribution companies; creating intermediation platforms to raise awareness and reduce transaction costs; and time-bound clearance of subsidy applications.”
Small energy grids
The Indian government has made it a priority to provide electricity to the 73 million rural households that either have no connection to the power grid or are not reliably served by it. According to the report, small energy grids (SEGs) -- most of them based on solar PV -- are now being used by 75,000 households. Installations in fiscal year 2016 were nearly 300 percent higher than in 2013, albeit from a small starting point. Financing for small energy grids is both haphazard and at a relatively miniscule level.
According to the report, the 11 companies pursuing small-grid development raised $16 million in equity and $6.26 in debt finance between fiscal year 2013 and 2016. “Financing for the SEG segment happens in fits and starts and is tied to the fortunes of a small number of companies,” the authors wrote. “Bank loans, venture capital and private equity, occasional funds from corporate social responsibility mandates, and crowdfunding are all being tapped as sources.”
One important change that needs to take place in order for small grid financing to increase and become more systematic is policy certainty about what happens when the grid is extended somewhere an SEG has been established. The worry investors in SEGs have is that competition from grid-supplied electricity will strand their investment. Addressing that question through policy can help.
Solar home systems and lanterns
According to the report's authors, around 5.5 million lanterns and solar home systems have been sold in India. The sector's growth potential, however, is limited by a number of factors, including a lack of access to financing for solar kit companies, because banks and investors consider the industry too high-risk. The report's authors highlight ways the sector can grow in a more robust way.
“As the market grows, new models like pay-as-you-go are gaining ground,” they wrote, also noting that the Reserve Bank of India has taken steps to increase banking services in rural, underserved areas. “Besides this, a unified payment interface has been launched that will allow money transfer from a bank account to different merchants, both online and offline, without the hassle of typing in credit card details.”
Finding our Home -err fragments of it….
We began our journey with a lucky break.
Our “home” was listed on tinyhouselistings.com. I was obsessed with browsing the site in my spare time and daydreaming. Our home was available to purchase for less than the cost of a shell. Shells can be purchased if you want to start your build with the exterior complete. At that cost, we were OK putting the work in to make it our own.
Funding
The unanimous opinion between online tiny-housers has been to buy out of pocket. The lifestyle is about escaping debt and living freely. Though it may work for some, it was not a feasible option for us.
We were lucky enough to be renting a house for $1,000 a month + utilities at the time. In Edmonton that's a pretty good deal especially considering that we had such a fantastic landlord (we miss you Larry!!!).
Moving into a smaller/cheaper rental property would have been very difficult with a dog, two cats and fostered animals on the side. I also didn't want to loose our garden. Having a place to play instruments was an added bonus to lower our stress.
We each had our own debts, due to a small business startup loan and school. That left us on the debt treadmill. We were slowly paying things off but it would have been years until we would even be ready to start saving for a home of our own.
Living costs
Average monthly rent (+ utilities)= $1,300 X 12 months= $15,600
^ Each year we literally flushed away $15,600.
We decided to get a loan. Even with the interest being skimmed by the bank- our money was going into an investment!
Buying a home site unseen
We found the Copper House in northern Ontario. The location signified that it was built to withstand intense weather.
The house had been built by a contractor for his in-law who lost interest quickly. We made an offer that factored in the cost of having it transported to Edmonton/Area (NOT CHEAP). The offer went through and our house was on it's way.
We moved out of our rental property the following month and prepared to camp for the summer. Our home was parked on my fathers property and he has been kind enough to let us use his facilities during the building process.
What we needed
-Solar
-Stairs (for the dog)
-Bathroom (composting toilet/shower/etc)
-A full water tank
-Hot water heater
-All new piping (the piping inside was “not sufficient for hot water”)
-Stove/Oven
-Ventilation
To make our layout work we took down all the inner walls and started over. Here are some pictures of the progress. For more detailed information and updates check our blog posts. This was just the beginning.
Manchester United in talks with adidas over world record £60m-per-year kit deal
German sportswear giants adidas in pole position to clinch a world record kit deal with Manchester United
A £60million-a-year has all but been agreed
Nike's deal expires in June 2015 - they will decide if it is worth more than doubling their current deal which cost £300m for 10 years
Negotiations with Nike have been going on for three years but their exclusive negotiating period expired last autumn
Adidas is in pole position to clinch a world record kit deal with Manchester United.
Senior insiders at the German sportswear giant believe a £60million-a-year deal has all but been agreed, even though current sponsors Nike retains the right to match any offer and extend a partnership that dates back to 2002 with United.
That, however, is thought to be unlikely when Nike is sure to question whether it is worth more than doubling their original £300m 10-year deal – which expires in June 2015 – when the deposed champions are going through this difficult period of transition.

Meetings: United officials met adidas executives in Germany after the game with Bayern Munich - CEO Ed Woodward (centre) and Managing Director Richard Arnold (second from left) know they have to get a deal signed quickly because of demand
United officials met adidas executives in Germany after their recent Champions League encounter against Bayern Munich and senior figures from the sportswear brand have been attending recent matches at Old Trafford.
Negotiations with Nike have been going on for the last three years, but when their exclusive negotiating period expired last autumn that opened the door for companies like adidas and Warrior. It is adidas who are now prepared to sign off the biggest football club kit deal in history in the belief that United's global appeal remains undamaged by a disastrous domestic season that culminated in the dismissal of manager David Moyes. Imminent: Louis van Gaal is expected to be announced as Manchester United boss this week
Deal: Chelsea has a 10-year £300m sponsorship deal with adidas
Ed Woodward, the United executive vice chairman, has been busy recruiting a replacement, with Louis van Gaal's appointment thought to be imminent.
But Woodward and the club's commercial director Richard Arnold know they need to sign off the next kit deal as soon as possible too, simply because the sheer demand for United merchandise means production needs to begin sooner rather than later.
A lawsuit filed by Washington, D.C. publicist Wendy Gordon against gossip site FishbowlDC and its parent company Thursday contains some of the best lines in a legal document ever.
Gordon claims that the site launched an “unprovoked, online smear campaign” against her by writing a weekly feature, “Wendy Wednesday,” about her. She is seeking $1 million in punitive damages and $1 million in compensatory damages.
FishbowlDC's lawyer said in a statement to Politico, “While we cannot comment on the specifics of pending litigation, we do not believe that there is any merit to the claims and plan to defend against them vigorously.”
Below are 10 examples of masterfully weaving legalese and modern lingo that actually made an entire lawsuit enjoyable to read.
“Ms. Gordon was not ‘DTF' (i.e., ‘down to fuck' or looking to have sex) or ‘on the prowl' at this charity event…”
“Defendants also stated that anyone seek to have sexual relations with Ms. Gordon would want to wear two condoms (i.e., ‘double bagging'), falsely implying that Ms. Gordon has some loathsome disease.”
“Defendants also falsely claimed that Ms. Gordon is a ‘cougar,' which is a derogatory term for an older woman who is aggressively pursuing sexual relationships with other men, including men young enough to be her son.”
“Ms. Gordon had not ‘straddled Tiger Woods' a few weeks earlier, or any other time for that matter'””
“Ms. Gordon was not ‘wishing she was working the waxy wang' [of former D.C. Mayor Marion Barry] or anything of the sort, and to suggest otherwise is not only false and defamatory, but disgusting and in extremely poor taste.”
“Ms. Gordon does not emit some type of unusual heat between her legs that would cause a wax figure to melt.”
“Defendants also put Ms. Gordon in a false light by comparing her to chlamydia, a venereal disease, or implying that Ms. Gordon might have chlamydia, which she does not.”
“Ms. Gordon was not ‘shitfaced,' drunk or even inebriated at the time.”
“Defendants falsely suggested that Ms. Gordon had her hand in the man's pants or was engaged in some other sexual contact with him.”
“Defendants have falsely portrayed Ms. Gordon as a big drinker, loose, party girl, cougar who is constantly ‘on the prowl.'”

INSIDER-TRADING prosecutions usually revolve around whether information is illegally obtained and then, knowingly and profitability, traded on. On July 19th America's Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) used a novel approach to charge Steven Cohen, boss of SAC Capital, one of world's most successful hedge funds. The agency asserts he should have known that two of his employees had illegally obtained information (which turned out to be worth $275m, through trading profits and avoided losses) and then failed to supervise them sufficiently to discourage violations of the law.
Whether this argument flies in court is an open question. The SEC's move suggests that, after an extensive investigation, it had not collected strong enough evidence to directly accuse Mr Cohen of insider trading and chose to opt for an alternative charge rather than drop the case.

The decision comes after a deal between the SEC and SAC in March. The hedge fund did not admit or deny any wrongdoing, but affiliates agreed to pay $614m to settle charges in cases against two portfolio managers, Mathew Martoma and Michael Steinberg, who are both awaiting criminal trial. Both have said that they have done nothing wrong and are fighting the charges.
The SEC argues that rather than challenge the two when they provided “highly suspicious information”, Mr Cohen did the opposite, giving Mr Martoma a $9m bonus and praising Mr Steinberg. “Hedge fund managers are responsible for exercising supervision over their employees to ensure that their firms comply with the law”, said Andrew Ceresney, a co-director of enforcement at the SEC, in a statement.
It is not clear, however, whether that is indeed the case. The rules for proper supervision in cases of insider trading are not precise and have largely been the product of court decisions. In a carefully written statement SAC vowed to contest the charges. "The SEC's administrative proceeding has no merit,” it states. “Steve Cohen acted appropriately at all times and will fight this charge vigorously. The SEC ignores SAC's exceptional supervisory structure, its extensive compliance policies and procedures, and Steve Cohen's strong support for SAC's compliance program."
For years questions have been raised as to how Mr Cohen managed to produce extraordinary investment returns and whether his approach crossed legal boundaries. But he has never been charged before. SAC has a complex structure with much of the investing done by people working within affiliates which do not have clear legal ties to Mr Cohen himself.
The most important aspect of the charges relates to Mr Cohen's treatment of Mr Martoma. Mr Cohen permitted the portfolio manager to build and then liquidate a large position in two drug companies, Elan and Wyeth—despite contrary opinions within his firm. The SEC alleges Mr Martoma received insider information from a doctor involved in the evaluation of a potential blockbuster treatment for Alzheimer's disease and traded on the information. Mr Cohen “encouraged Martoma to speak with the doctor who Cohen had been told may have Phase II Trial results—information that any reasonable hedge fund manager should have known might be material and non-public,” the complaint says.
Since the charges against Mr Cohen are civil, rather than criminal, he is likely to only face fines and restrictions on his ability to invest for others. Given his vast fortune, prospects are good for yet another settlement which makes both sides happy: the defendant pays up without confirming nor denying guilt—while the SEC takes the money and declares victory.
This practice, however, has come under increasing criticism. The SEC has vowed to take more cases to their conclusion, be it a determination of guilt or innocence. As a result, even if the outcome of the case against Mr Cohen is by no means obvious, it is a good bet that his legal entanglements will not end soon.
Last Wednesday, revenge porn site owner Hunter Moore was sentenced to two and a half years in prison.
Moore operated the now defunct site Is Anyone Up?, which allowed users to anonymously submit nude photos. As expected, the vast majority of the pics submitted were done without the permission of the person in the photos. Ex-lovers, evil friends, and hackers submitted most of the content on the site.
Moore, who described himself as a “professional life-ruiner”, didn't just rely on users to submit photos. At one point, Moore paid a friend named Charles Evans to hack into women's e-mail and steal intimate photos.
One of the victims, Kayla Laws, had topless photos of herself stolen by Evans and posted on Moore's site. Since then, Kayla's mother Charlotte Laws has become an anti-revenge porn activist and is one of the reasons why Moore was in court last week, where he faced charges of fraud and identity theft.
In her testimony, Kayla described what happened when her photos went viral, which “completely flipped [her] world upside down.”
Her entire testimony can be found here, but I decided to pick out a few parts that show exactly what happens when intimate pictures go viral.
Kayla on how the photos were hacked:
A few months before I was hacked, I had taken the photos alone in the mirror in my bedroom. These photos had never been seen nor sent to anyone. I had absolutely no intention of letting anyone see them. I took tons of photos. Most of them were clothed. I emailed them to myself to eventually save on my computer. They were in a private folder called “my pix” along with a plethora of other photos of my dogs, little brothers, parents and such.
Then she went into detail about the day she found out she had been hacked:
I found out my photos were online while at my then waitressing job. I received a phone call from the hostess not working that night telling me to step outside because she had something urgent to tell me. I stepped outside and she proceeded to tell me that I had a topless photo online along with my full name, Twitter account link, and current city.
On how she was fired from her job:
I was hoping no one would see it, but within a day a mass text with my photo had been sent to everyone at my restaurant. The assistant manager said she could get me fired over it, and I lost a role in a film, not to mention the tens of thousands of strangers who saw, commented on or even possibly saved the photo.
She even said that Ron Jeremy contacted her:
When I got home that night I noticed a bunch of random guys adding me on Facebook and following me on social media. I received vile sexual messages and rude comments. One guy told me he saved the photo, which mortified me. The porn star Ron Jeremy even contacted me to “talk business.”
Moore refused to remove the photos
I decided to email Hunter Moore. I asked him nicely to remove my photo, which shortly turned into me pleading with him. But still he wouldn't take it down.
He even tweeted her photos to 600,000 followers
Hunter Moore instead decided to publicly brag online to his 600,000 followers by lying about me and further damaging my reputation. He called me a whore, and he wrote on Twitter, “I fucked Charlotte Laws' daughter so many times” and “her daughter sucks the best cock.” Your honor, I've never been in the same room with Hunter Moore except in court.
Kayla even has a stalker
Once he noticed that we had seen him, he sped off, almost crashing into our neighbor's wall. My mom received threatening phone calls and tweets from members of Hunter Moore's cult. Some people said they would kill her, and Hunter Moore himself said he would buy a gun and kill the person who started the FBI investigation, who happened to be my mother.
Moore threatened to ruin her life
He sent a tweet to my mom saying, “Posting your daughter's nudes tonight. I am Internet and SEO genius.” Then he wrote again “I'll ruin your life and your daughter's the fun way. When you and your daughter get my dick out of your mouths, you will realize how hard I troll you.” He also tried to harass me and mom online by linking our names with his YouTube video titled “How to have sex with cripples.”
I'm not sure how to end this article. Thankfully, there's a quote from Kayla that sums up my feelings:
There is no ounce of humanity in Hunter Moore and nor do I believe he is capable of rehabilitation. This man is full of hate.
I'm sure Moore's fellow federal prison inmates will enjoy his presence for the next two years.

What's The Hustle?
So a dude wrote a column. In it, he expressed his disappointment in our comic book and described his retailer tearing up a copy. (Please don't go looking for the column; just take my word for it–dude gets paid every time you click and in an unbelievably classy move I should have seen coming, is now using the attention to promote his own books. Comics!) Follow me so far? Dude wrote a column… Then the internet blew up. This is the only statement I'm going to make on the matter, so read slow.
When I got the email giving me the heads-up, I thought it was funny. I don't know if that makes me sound like an ass—if it does, please understand that dude has been around for as long as I have and he's been hilariously condescending to people far more talented than I am for so long that it's almost a rite of passage. Like… okay, years ago I was an operator on the graveyard shift at Home Shopping Network and there was a masturbator who called every night. You didn't actuallywant to be the one who took that call, but when you finally got it… you sort of felt like you'd finally earned your wings.
So when the email came, I literally laughed out loud. Hey! I got jumped in!
The guy tearing up the book? I dunno. It's a little theatrical for my taste (and look at me, my favorite color is leopard print) but whatever. It's his shop, his book, he can do whatever he wants. Doesn't seem like good business to me, but what do I know? I don't run a store. Maybe his customer eat that kind of thing up like pro wrestling. If it's working for him, good on ‘im. (Also: same guy tore up SCARLET #1, which is a book I LOVE, so hey — win! For the record, I don't think my gender had anything to do with anything, but given the Scarlet thing, it's possible dude might have an issue with artificial redheads. I dunno. It's a theory.**)
Not everybody's gonna like the book. Did you miss the part where I said it's a weird book? It's a weird book. I'm proud of it. I'm bursting with pride at Emma's innovative layouts, Jordie's gorgeous colors, Clayton's… well, Clayton's infinite patience with my foibles, more than anything else probably, but that's saying something. (I'm teasing you, Clayton. I'm proud of you too.) I'm proud of Sigrid for keeping us on schedule and Caitlin for having all our backs like the fierce little mama bear she is. I'm as proud of my contribution as I'm capable of being. Mostly, I'm proud of myself for stepping outside my comfort zone.
All that said, not everybody's gonna dig it and that's okay. That doesn't make us failures and it doesn't make them misogynists. If you didn't “get” the book, that's okay; you're not dumb. (Am I being clear enough? No one is calling you dumb.) Taste is subjective. I like liver and onions and Offspring*. Probably you don't. That doesn't make either of us dumb or even wrong. (The way you chose to express your taste says more about you than your taste itself.)
So, when the email came in, I laughed. Can't please everybody. And hey, we had a hell of a Wednesday.
Then… the internet exploded. I keep not-commenting hoping it'll just go away, but every ten minutes somebody new decides to run the “story,” folks are saying I said things I not only never said, I never THOUGHT… it's just… WTF?
Look, I've got a hide like a rhino, I can take it. And I know a lot of folks who are perpetuating this are doing so out of love, wanting to come to our defense. And I love them for it, I do. But every outraged post magically puts words in my mouth I never said and makes that one dude THE story.
THAT IS NOT THE STORY. THAT ONE DUDE IS NOT THE STORY.
THIS is the story: You know what we thought this book would do? 9-12K. A couple of our more experienced friends at Image said that they thought it might do as well as 20K — we guffawed. When I saw the initial orders I was in Brisbane — Fraction will tell you, I got light-headed. My hearing went out. As of right now, we have blown through our print run of 57K and are going to a second printing. Do the math. With the second printing we're going to be at THREE TIMES our DREAM NUMBER. How is that even possible?
That is the story.
The book—our weird little book that has surprised and defied us at every turn—came out Wednesday and surprised and defied us yet again. The same site that ran the piece that started all this gave us 4.5/5.0. We got 3 reviews that gave us 10/10. We've gotten tons of great mail already, beautiful fan art and it's starting to feel like there's a Pretty Deadly community burgeoning.
JH FUCKING WILLIAMS WROTE TO US THIS MORNING. I know it's impolite to namedrop, but hello–JH FUCKING WILLIAMS!!
::muppet flail::
My team got ONE WHOLE DAY to feel good about defying expectations before what should have been a non-event became the ubiquitous headline.
So here's the tl;dr — nobody on our team thinks they're a genius. (You don't like my stuff? Hell, a good half the time, I agree with you.) We're trying some things. If our things are not your bag, that's okay. As long as you don't tut tut me, put words in my mouth, call me pretentious or try to profit from bad-mouthing my team, we're totally gonna stay friends. And if they are your bag? Know we don't take your support for granted. We're gonna keep trying things and, well, cheer up, haters! We may well fall flat on our faces yet. I like issue 2 more than issue 1 and issue 3 more than issue 2, but I dunno… your mileage may vary, as they kids say.
All we want to do is have fun, hang out and make comics. Can we pleeeeeeeaaase move on from this shit now?

Abstract
This article contends that every American law school ought to substantially eliminate C grades by settings its good academic standing grade point average at the B- level. Grading systems that require or encourage law professors to award a significant number of C marks are flawed for two reasons. First, low grades damage students' placement prospects. Employers frequently consider a job candidate's absolute GPA in making hiring decisions. If a school systematically assigns inferior grades, its students are at an unfair disadvantage when competing for employment with students from institutions that award mostly A's and B's. Second, marks in the C range injure students psychologically. Students perceive C's as a sign of failure. Accordingly, when they receive such grades, their stress level is exacerbated in unhealthy ways. This psychological harm is both intrinsically problematic and compromises the educational process. Substantially eliminating C grades will bring about critical improvements in both the fairness of the job market and the mental well-being of our students. These benefits outweigh any problems that might be caused or aggravated by inflated grades. C marks virtually always denote unsatisfactory work in American graduate education. Law schools are the primary exception to this convention. It is time we adopted the practice followed by the rest of the academy.
Two more people died in the violence on Saturday in southern Nepal, pushing the number of deaths in the agitation to over 50.
Fresh violence is being reported from the Nepalese side of border with India where the Madhesi community continues a blockade, severely affecting the trade ties between the two countries.The Madhesis, who share ethnic and familial ties with India, have been protesting against Nepal's new constitution which they say does not give the community a fair representation.The adoption of the new constitution completes 100 days today. Two more people died in the violence on Saturday in southern Nepal, pushing the number of deaths in the agitation to over 50.The Nepalese Police on Saturday fired upon a mob in Saptari District after it attacked the policemen with petrol bombs and bricks."In the name of dialogue the Nepal government is doing drama, they are not serious about our issues. They talk about dialogue and on other hand peaceful protestors were fired upon. They are doing it to hide our demands and views," said Rajendra Mahato, President of the Sadbhavana Party which is actively involved in the protests in Nepal's Birgunj town.Meanwhile, on the Indian side of the border, at the crucial crossing at the Raxaul town, 5600 trucks carrying essential supplies, including fuel, have been stuck for over two months, crippling life in Nepal. This in-turn has forced Nepal to turn to China for help, blaming India for cutting off supplies and helping the protestors The Indian government has said it has nothing to do with the protests.
Sri Lanka 484 (Karunaratne 184, Chandimal 151, Bishoo 4-143) beat West Indies 251 (Bravo 50, Herath 6-68) and (f/o) 227 (Blackwood 92, Herath 4-79) by an innings and 6 runs
Scorecard and ball-by-ball details
Play 04:44 Play 04:44 Arnold: Blackwood showed temperament and positive attitude
Rangana Herath picked up his fifth 10-wicket match haul in Tests as Sri Lanka wrapped up victory by an innings and six runs inside the second session of day four. West Indies, who began the day two down for 67, lost eight wickets on the fourth day for the addition of 160 runs, and as in the first innings, a number of their batsmen failed to capitalise on starts. Their only consolation came from Jermaine Blackwood, who added a fleet-footed 92 to a string of eye-catching recent performances that have marked him out as a definite investment for the future.
Three of Herath's five ten-fors have now come in Galle. Perhaps no one has understood this surface as well as him. Even Muttiah Muralitharan, who ended his career with a staggering 22 ten-fors, only achieved the feat four times here.
The pitch for this match was slow even by Galle's standards, and none of the other spinners from both sides found a way to remain a wicket-taking threat. By attacking the stumps relentlessly and giving the batsmen no breathing space, Herath made every ball count - every subtle variation of pace and trajectory. Batsmen were in trouble nearly every time they went forward instead of back or back instead of forward, or played for turn when there was none.
West Indies began the fourth day two down, facing a deficit of 166. Perhaps they may have given themselves hope by imagining a scenario where their nightwatchman Devendra Bishoo hung around long enough to irritate the Sri Lankans while one or two of their specialist batsmen made hundreds. As early as the fifth over of the morning, Herath knocked those visions out of their heads.
First, he sent back Bishoo, who nicked an attempted square-cut to slip. In came Marlon Samuels, and out he went first ball, but not before calling for one of the most needless reviews in the history of the DRS. Staying on the back foot to a ball from Herath he should have been on the front foot to, Samuels shouldered arms. The ball slid in with the angle and pinged his back pad. Maybe Samuels believed the ball had struck him slightly outside the line - even then, he was offering no shot. In the event, it had struck him in line with off stump, and was destined to hit middle stump, three-fourths of the way up.
Nuwan Pradeep who had a mixed Test, was cranking up good pace and bowling a few good balls and a lot of poor ones. In the eighth over of the morning, he bowled his best ball of the match. Going around the wicket, he hit a good length in the corridor and got the ball to straighten a touch. Darren Bravo, pushing half-forward to defend, could only edge it to the keeper.
Though Sri Lanka took four key wickets in the session, they showed evidence of a troubling over-reliance on Herath, with their back-up spinners leaking runs to Jermaine Blackwood and Denesh Ramdin when the left-arm spinner left the field briefly. But the West Indies batsmen did not show the greatest appreciation of which balls to go after, and failed to make that over-reliance hurt Sri Lanka in any way.
Towards the end of day three, Kraigg Brathwaite and Darren Bravo had capitalised on Herath's absence to take 39 runs from 11 overs bowled by Pradeep, Milinda Siriwardana and Tharindu Kaushal. Now, Siriwardana and Kaushal bowled a series of full-tosses and short balls to concede four fours in two overs to Ramdin and Blackwood.
Blackwood, looking in smooth touch, continued batting with freedom over the next few overs, using his feet to get down the track to launch Kaushal over mid-on for six and drive Siriwardana inside-out for four.
But just when the partnership was giving West Indies the merest glimmer of hope, Ramdin drove loosely at Siriwardana and nicked to second slip. Blackwood almost followed Ramdin to the dressing room in Siriwardana's next over, edging him while trying to make room and drive despite not getting to the pitch of the ball. But Angelo Mathews, who was uncharacteristically generous at slip in this Test match, spilled the deflection off Kusal Perera's glove.
Blackwood survived through to lunch, and reached his half-century soon after. Jason Holder hung around long enough to add 36 with him for the seventh wicket before he was run out in slightly unfortunate circumstances. Stepping out to whip Herath into the leg side, he played across the ball which deflected off his pad to Mathews at slip. Spotting Holder out of his crease, he threw down the stumps direct.
Herath then removed Kemar Roach in a replay of his first-innings dismissal. An enticingly loopy delivery, dropping just short of the batsman's reach, a big heave and miss, and an alert Kusal Perera whipping the bails off with the batsman's back toe on the line. When Dhammika Prasad trapped Jerome Taylor with a full, straight ball in the next over, West Indies were nine down, with 44 still to get to avoid innings defeat.
Blackwood had only one option left - farm the strike and try to get West Indies as close as possible. Out came the dancing footwork, and he hit Herath for two fours and two sixes, all down the ground, in the space of nine balls. Rattled for once, Herath sent down a short ball, and Blackwood flat-batted it to the cover boundary.
He could only do so much all by himself, though. Batting on 92 with all nine fielders on the boundary, he ran down the track to the third ball of Prasad's over, and only managed to pick out deep extra cover. Perhaps he could have waited a couple of balls, for the field to come in and try to keep him on strike. It would have only delayed the inevitable.

Santa Clara University has removed a controversial university policy telling students call 9-1-1 to report “bias incidents.”
Campus Reform previously reported that the California university urging students to report bias incidents—which the university defined as “a speech, act, or harassing action that targets, threatens, or attacks an individual or group because of their actual or perceived race, color, national origin, ethnicity, religious affiliation, sex, gender identity, disability, or sexual orientation”—to the local authorities.
Students may now report bias incidents to the Office of Student Life or anonymously to a third party website.
“If [a] bias incident is in progress or just occurred: ALWAYS CALL 911 IMMEDIATELY,” the website stated.
After Campus Reform reported the story, the university removed the directive that students report bias to 9-1-1.
Santa Clara students are still encouraged to report bias incidents—just not to the police. The Catholic university now recommends that students report hate crimes--which the university defines as motivated "by bias and include definable crimes such as threats of violence, property damage, personal injury and other illegal conduct"--to the school's office of Campus Safety.
Alternatively, students may report bias incidents to the Office of Student Life or EthicsPoint, a third party website that allows students to file bias reports anonymously, or to a member of the Dean's staff at the Office of Student Life.
The university did not respond to Campus Reform's request for comment.

The worst baseball card of all time, 1996 Pinnacle Foil No. 289
The worst baseball card of all time is not the kind of bad that creeps up on you. Glance at 1996 Pinnacle Foil No. 289 for half a second and you'll see that two things are very, very wrong. First, Bob Hamelin's enormous head takes up most of the frame. Second, the small portion of the card that is not consumed by Hamelin's melon is filled by a placard. That placard, which is being held by Bob Hamelin, reads “BOB HAMELIN.” The Hamelin-held “BOB HAMELIN” sign is in turn partially obscured by a golden triangle with a name embossed on top: “BOB HAMELIN.”
The card's commitment to badness never wavers. Consider the fact that the “BOB HAMELIN” sign looks like it's about to slice Bob Hamelin's chin off. There's also the defeated look on Hamelin's face, which—along with the blinding glare on his oversized glasses—makes it look like he's being interrogated by the baseball police, or perhaps being held against his will by a designated-hitter-collecting maniac. The “Pinnacle 1996” logo in the upper-left-hand corner conceals the Kansas City Royals logo on Hamelin's cap, part of a recurring pattern of hiding terrible things behind other terrible things. And what's that written on the underside of Hamelin's hat bill? Just in case there's any question that the man on the Bob Hamelin card holding the “BOB HAMELIN” sign is Bob Hamelin, there it is in black marker: “HAMELIN.”
Some people believe that a bad baseball card is one in which a player looks like a nerd, has an afro or a unibrow, or is talking on an enormous cellphone. These are not bad cards. A bad baseball card is one in which errors of composition, design, or production conspire to turn a 2.5-by-3.5-inch piece of cardboard into a memorabilia crime scene.
The experts agree: 1996 Pinnacle Foil No. 289 is a very bad baseball card. “It's so jarring and awful, a collision of unpleasant forms and surfaces,” says Josh Wilker, the author of the memoir Cardboard Gods. “I fear for anyone dwelling too long on this card. There should be contests to see who can last the longest staring at it before screaming into the night.” Beau and Bryan Abbott, proprietors of the site Baseball Card Vandals, give 1996 Pinnacle Hamelin their highest praise, calling it “awesomely terrible.” Dave Jamieson, author of Mint Condition: How Baseball Cards Became an American Obsession, wonders if someone at Pinnacle really hated Bob Hamelin and wanted to make him look bad on purpose. (The blog Royals Review agrees with this theory.)
“We did try to be creative with some of the photos that were used on cards. That was definitely one of them!” says Shawn Heilbron, who was the communications and marketing manager for Pinnacle in 1996. Heilbron, now a senior associate athletic director at Oregon State University, says the photo was likely taken at the Royals' media day. “Players were typically asked to hold up a sign with their name so they could be identified easily,” Heilbron says. “Usually, the guys would hold the sign down low so it would not be in the shot. The image on that card was likely an outtake from that.”
Jamieson doesn't buy it. He argues that Hamelin's alleged poor sign-holding technique is no excuse for producing such a lousy baseball card, especially when the bar for quality is set so low. “It's easy to make a mediocre one,” says the Mint Condition author. “Just tell Bob Hamelin to put a bat on his shoulder and smile or not smile. Most cards are exercises in mediocrity.”
OK, maybe this is the worst baseball card of all time.
Jamieson believes that the worst baseball cards come from the worst baseball card eras. In the 1970s, when Topps had a monopoly on the hobby, there was no market pressure to create a beautiful, compelling, error-free product. The stats on the back were often full of mistakes. The photos would be out of focus. And instead of reshooting a player after he switched teams, the company would instead do a terrible job airbrushing the new club's logo onto his old hat.
Increased competition from Donruss and Fleer in the early 1980s did not guarantee that every card would be a winner—see the 1982 Fleer Jack Morris card on the left. Still, the 1980s and early 1990s were a relative golden age for card aesthetics, with old-line firms like Topps forced to up their game to compete with new rivals and upstarts like Upper Deck bringing higher production values to the hobby. But by the mid-1990s, Jamieson argues, more was not merrier. The rising belief that baseball cards were “cardboard gold” led a whole bunch of companies to flood the market with hologram-and-foil-bedecked, mass-produced collectibles. Some of these cards were snazzy. Some were … less snazzy.
Pinnacle Brands first got in the sports card game in the mid-1980s with Sportflics, which used a lenticular printing process to make the images appear to move when you tilted the card. The company started producing cards under the Score trade name in 1988, then released its first Pinnacle baseball issue in 1992. The 1996 Pinnacle Foil set that changed humanity forever is marked by gold foil triangles that jut up from the bottom of the frame, often seeming to stab players in the groin. This was just one of a mind-boggling array of different sets that Pinnacle brought to market in 1996, including Pinnacle Aficionado, Pinnacle First Rate, Pinnacle Starburst, Pinnacle Team Spirit, and Pinnacle Christie Brinkley Collection. Given all the cards the company was cranking out, at least a handful were bound to stretch the limits of human decency. Such was the baseball card market of the 1990s. And this, too, was a sign of the times: In 1998, two years after Pinnacle Foil No. 289 came off the presses, Pinnacle Brands filed for bankruptcy. The baseball card bubble had burst.
The arc of Bob Hamelin's career coincides perfectly with that of Pinnacle Brands. The Elizabeth, N.J., native made his minor-league debut in 1988, finally cracking the Royals' big-league roster five years later. In 1994, the slugging DH cracked 24 home runs, beating out Manny Ramirez to win the American League Rookie of the Year award. The Hammer, though, was out of the big leagues for good after hitting .219 for the Milwaukee Brewers in 1998.
Hamelin is now a scout for the Boston Red Sox, and he says he couldn't ask for a better job. He also looks back on his playing days with fondness, a nostalgia trip that's easier to take when you've got piles of your old baseball cards around the house. That's one benefit of playing in the Pinnacle era. Hamelin, who was in the big leagues for just six seasons, has 119 different cards listed on Sports Card Source, and that doesn't even include 1995 Tombstone Pizza No. 3. The most valuable of those cards, according to COMC.com, is worth $5.75. Depending on where you look, the 1996 Pinnacle Foil No. 289 is valued at anywhere from 33 cents to 39 cents.
Having a huge stash of cards comes in handy, Hamelin says, when the mailman asks if you really played in the majors or when your kids' friends are looking for a souvenir. The 1994 Rookie of the Year says he still gets around 200 cards in the mail each year from autograph seekers. Sometimes, he admits, he'll swipe a few if someone sends more than a dozen in a single envelope.
He's seen that Pinnacle card before, and it reminds him of spring training. One day each year, players would go into some auxiliary room, he says, and get herded through 15 different stations—one for ESPN to take a headshot, another where you'd hold the bat on your shoulder for a card company, another where you take a swing. Each player would hold a sign so all the different photographers know who they're shooting. Most of the time, the guy with the camera chose the best image. This time, Hamelin says, “Maybe they accidentally erased every other picture.”
Bob Hamelin's least favorite baseball card
Bob Hamelin does not think the worst baseball card of all time is the worst baseball card of his career. The first time he ever appeared on a card was in 1988, when he played for the Class A Eugene Emeralds. That time, they spelled his last name wrong.
In the end, then, perhaps Pinnacle Foil No. 289 shouldn't be regarded as an example of everything that can go wrong with a baseball card. Rather, we can focus on how Pinnacle got it right. The company didn't just spell Hamelin's name correctly—H-A-M-E-L-I-N is written out three separate times in all its glory.
Yeah, I don't think so. This is, and will perhaps always be, the worst baseball card of all time. But don't feel too bad for Bob Hamelin—he's got 118 other cards that he can hand out to the mailman. “Sometimes they get it, sometimes they don't,” he says. “They didn't get it on that shot.”
Em Rusciano fires back at John Laws in response to his take on workplace femininity
JOHN Laws has fired back at Em Rusciano who yesterday labelled the veteran broadcaster an “irrelevant, sexist, misogynist idiot”.
Laws wrote a letter to the 2Day FM breakfast host saying he had no idea who she was and ruling out a potential one-on-one chat between the two.
The letter comes after Rusciano blasted Laws on air yesterday after the 81-year-old's interview on The Project during which he confirmed he still demands his female employees wear skirts at work.
“You bet,” Laws said told Steve Price on the Channel Ten program.
“I love women. It's been one of my great downfalls in life. I love to talk to them. I'd much rather talk to them than a bunch of blokes and I love them to look feminine and to me, a skirt on a beautiful body is a very, very feminine thing.”
In The Project interview, Laws also said that “political correctness can totally annul freedom of speech” and that he doesn't care if he gets in trouble.
“All this nonsense you can't say somebody is fat ... if they're fat, they're fat for Christ's sake,” Laws said.
Rusciano weighed in on Laws' comments with her co-host Harley Breen yesterday morning and began her on-air smackdown by describing the radio star as “a very glamorous corpse with an interesting weave”.
She sarcastically praised Laws “for reminding us that women are only around for men to look at” and “the only way to show that I am a female is to wear a skirt and I only need to be in a workplace to provide eye candy for the men who are above me”.
In regards to Laws's comments about freedom of speech, Rusciano said, “it means also that I can call you an irrelevant, sexist, misogynist idiot who should not be on air”.
Rusciano finished the break by offering herself up as a guest to appear on John Laws's 2SM radio show.
“I'll wear a three-piece suit and smoke a cigar ... Let's sit down and have a chat buddy,” Rusciano said.
But John Laws responded to Rusciano's offer in a letter and made it quite clear she'll never be entering his studio for a chat.
The letter reads:
“M (I hope I have spelt that correctly)
“I have been told about the phone call from your very charming producer Kim, but I don't know what you want.
“I can tell you what I don't want, and that is to have some strange woman who I don't know and probably don't want to know, wander into my studio in a three-piece suit and smoking a cigar. Let alone wanting to call me Buddy!
“Dear, dear, dear you are a funny little person. I don't know what the future holds for you but I do know it won't include a so-called ‘irrelevant, sexist misogynist idiot who shouldn't be on air'.”
Laws then saved the best line for last, ending the letter with, “P.S. By the way, who are you?”

The Texas Attorney General and a Texas county are putting a Mexican national on trial Monday. Her alleged crime: illegally voting in two Texas elections.
The 37-year-old woman, Rosa Maria Ortega, was indicted in November 2015 for the crime of “Illegal Voting.” She is now facing trial for the offense — a felony in Texas.
According to the Tarrant County indictment, Ortega is accused of voting in the November 2012 General Election and in the May 2014 Primary Run-off Election. According to the indictment, she did so “when she knew she was not a United States citizen.”
Ortega lives in Grand Prairie, Texas, a city located between Fort Worth and Dallas. According to a 2015 article by the local NBC affiliate, Ortega had previously applied to vote in the county but officials rejected her application when she acknowledged that she was not a citizen. She applied again five months later and claimed she was a citizen.
According to officials prosecuting the case, Ortega did not vote in the 2016 presidential election. She was indicted by a Tarrant County grand jury in November 2015. Breitbart Texas' Bob Price reported her arrest in 2015.
The Texas Penal Code provides that the offense of “Illegal Voting,” is committed where a person:
votes or attempts to vote in an election in which the person knows the person is not eligible to vote; knowingly votes or attempts to vote more than once in an election; knowingly impersonates another person and votes or attempts to vote as the impersonated person; or knowingly marks or attempts to mark another person's ballot without the consent of that person.
The offense is a felony of the second degree unless the person is convicted of the lesser offense of attempt. The latter would be a state jail felony.
Texas legislators enacted the law in 2011 and it became effective on January 1, 2012.
Ortega is facing trial in Tarrant County Criminal District Court Number 3, the Honorable Judge Robb Catalano presiding. Catalano is a Republican judge who previously served as an assistant district attorney in the county.
On October 24, just prior to the November presidential election, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) issued a press release warning poll watchers hoping to prevent voter fraud that they themselves could be violating federal voting rights law. The federal officials counseled them against communicating or “challenging voters,” reported Breitbart Texas.
“The statement does not grant the varying distinctions in which states may allow communication between voters and poll watchers, nor does the DOJ note that some observers in specific states do indeed have the power to challenge would-be voters based on documented ineligibility,” the Breitbart Texas article noted. The DOJ was also publicizing an “Election Complaint Report” form where voters could report “a possible violation of the federal voting rights laws.”
Voter fraud watchers urge that communications like these from the federal government acts, as it is thought to intend to, to stifle enforcement of voter laws by poll watchers and public election officials.
Just days after he was sworn-in, President Donald Trump promised to call for a voter fraud investigation, including investigating those who illegally voted because they were not U.S. citizens, reported Breitbart Texas.
During the traditional pre-Super Bowl interview with Fox News Channel host Bill O'Reilly, President Trump recommitted his administration to probing the larger issue of election integrity, particularly where voter rolls may become tainted with outdated and ineligible voters, by charging Vice President Mike Pence with leading a “commission” to look into the matter, according to The Washington Times.
In late January, Breitbart News published an article by California Assemblyman Tim Donnelly saying that “The media have exhibited a pathological determination to ignore any possibility of voter fraud, in spite of mountains of evidence to the contrary.”
The article, entitled “California's Recipe for Voter Fraud on a Massive Scale,” laid out the things that enable voter fraud, including pushing massive voting by mail. Other components to the “recipe” includes: making it easy to vote online two weeks before Election Day; spending millions of taxpayer dollars handing out drivers licenses to illegal aliens; and passing a law that requires everyone with a drivers license to be “automatically” registered to vote.
Shortly before the 2016 Election, the Public Interest Legal Foundation released a study of select Virginia city and county voter registration records, finding more than 1,000 foreign nationals registered to vote with a significant percentage of them having voted before being found.
A New York Assemblyman introduced legislation last week that if passed, would allow approximately 150,000 illegal aliens in New York City to get a driver's license, reported Breitbart Texas. Statewide, 265,000 illegal aliens would be eligible.
Both chambers of the Texas Legislature have produced bills in the 2017 session that seek to prevent noncitizen voter registration from the outset. House Bill 1079, authored by Rep. Mike Schofield (R-Houston), and SB 136, submitted by Sen. Van Taylor (R-Plano), would require documentary proof of U.S. citizenship when registering to vote.
True the Vote President Catherine Engelbrecht joined Breitbart News Daily in late November and said, “I mean, if it's so easy to be a CNN, right, to affirm that there are no concerns to be had about illegal votes, and non-citizen voting isn't something that we should look at, then let's get CNN to ask the federal government to show us how they can conclusively tell us that non-citizens aren't registered. Show us the process that they use to screen federal registration applications,” she suggested.
Engelbrecht said no one has looked into it because when states ask to, they get sued. We've institutionalized the fraud, we've made it this taboo that no one's allowed to speak about because this is what happens. It's a political minefield, and it's not for the faint of heart. But somebody's got to walk through it, or at some point we're going to find ourselves in a banana republic where votes really don't matter, and then you can't unring that bell. We're perilously close to that point now,” Engelbrecht warned.
It “serves all of our interests” to ask the questions that need to be asked about how many illegal voters are on the voter rolls, she said.

Critics fear Japan's democracy 'regressing' with government set to introduce new secrecy laws
Updated
Critics say tough new secrecy laws coming into effect in Japan are draconian, with protesters calling for them to scrap.
In 2009, investigative journalist Masakatsu Ota uncovered a top secret deal between Japan and United States that allowed nuclear weapons to be brought into Japan during the Cold War.
Ota said the reports were very much in the public interest.
"A key person in government confirmed it for the first time and the reports triggered an inquiry," he said.
"The people got the truth and because they did, they could think more deeply about new policies and the nuclear issue. We have special feelings about this because of atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki."
Under the new secrecy laws exposes like Ota's will be much harder to do.
Laws needed to 'tighten' national security
Whistleblowers who hand over state secrets can get up to 10 years' jail and journalists encouraging them can get five years in prison.
Experts have described the laws as extreme and part of prime minister Shinzo Abe's wider agenda to revise Japan's constitution.
Law Professor Lawrence Repeta from Tokyo's Meiji University said the government has a lot of power.
"They say the right to freedom of speech should only be respected when it doesn't disturb public order," he said.
"They also say that in their constitution they propose the government has authority to declare state of emergency and rule by cabinet."
Mr Abe said Japan needed the new laws to exchange military secrets like submarine technology with allies like Australia and to tighten the nation's security in times increasing regional tension.
'Democracy is regressing' in Japan
But the public does not agree.
The majority are against the laws and at protests across the country over the weekend people called for them to be scrapped.
One elderly woman told the ABC: "The people's right to know and freedom of press is disappearing. Democracy is regressing".
Another protester said Japan was heading back to its militarist past with these new laws.
"When Japan headed to militarism, people were arrested if they showed opposition, that's the scariest thing. Democracy has not matured yet, but it's been developing and I want to stop this move," the protester said.
Already the government is set to classify 500,000 documents as state secrets.
Critics have said the real danger of these laws will see the government ultimately deciding what is secret and the definitions can be vague.
From December 10, 19 government ministries can designate state secrets under 55 categories covering defence, diplomacy and security and they can stay secret for up to 60 years.

Humans tend to dismiss Neanderthals as dimwits, yet the brains of our doomed cousins were actually larger than our own. “If you go to a site from 150,000 years ago,” says Miki Ben-Dor, a Tel Aviv University archaeologist, “you won't be able to tell whether Neanderthals or Homo sapiens lived there, because they had all the same tools.” Which helps explain why, to fathom how our fates diverged, he recently scrutinized Neanderthals' bodies instead of their skulls.
While humans have barrel-shaped chests and narrow pelvises, Neanderthals had bell-shaped torsos with wide pelvises. The prevailing explanation has been that Neanderthals, often living in colder and drier environments than their human contemporaries, needed more energy and therefore more oxygen, so their torsos swelled to hold a bigger respiratory system.
But Ben-Dor had a gut feeling this was wrong. What if the difference was what they ate? Living in Eurasia 300,000 to 30,000 years ago, Neanderthals settled in places like the Polar Urals and southern Siberia—not bountiful in the best of times, and certainly not during ice ages. In the heart of a tundra winter, with no fruits and veggies to be found, animal meat—made of fat and protein—was likely the only energy source.
Alas, though fat is easier to digest, it's scarce in cold conditions, as prey animals themselves burn up their fat stores and grow lean. So Neanderthals must have eaten a great deal of protein, which is tough to metabolize and puts heavy demands on the liver and kidneys to remove toxic byproducts. In fact, we humans have a “protein ceiling” of between 35 and 50 percent of our diet; eating too much more can be dangerous. Ben-Dor thinks that Neanderthals' bodies found a way to utilize more protein, developing enlarged livers and kidneys, and chests and pelvises that widened over the millennia to accommodate these beefed-up organs.
For confirmation of his theory, Ben-Dor looks to today's Inuit peoples, who live in northern climes, subsist at times on an all-meat diet and have larger livers and kidneys and longer ribs than average Europeans.
To cope with the fat famine, Neanderthals probably also specialized in hunting gigantic animals like mammoths, which retain fat longer in poor conditions, and require greater strength but less energy and speed to kill. (Mammoths don't run away, and you only have to kill one to feast for months.)
But as these mega-beasts vanished, the burly Neanderthals likely struggled to chase down smaller, swifter prey. Meanwhile, humans, with our narrow pelvises and agile forms, scampered into the future.
CHICAGO (CBS) — A man arrested for DUI on Christmas Eve in west suburban Riverside had a blood alcohol level of more than four times the legal limit, police said.
Authorities were called about an intoxicated driver at 10:44 p.m. Sunday near 26th Street and Des Plaines Avenue in North Riverside, according to a statement from Riverside police.
A Riverside officer spotted the car, a 1999 Lincoln, on 31st Street at Des Plaines, where it was “weaving from lane to lane and hitting the curb several times,” police said. The officer cut the Lincoln off and positioned his squad car at an angle to stop the driver on 1st Avenue south of 31st Street, next to Brookfield Zoo.
The officer could smell “a strong odor of alcohol coming from inside the car and on the driver's breath,” police said. Open cans of beer and an open bottle of vodka were visible inside the car.
The driver, 46-year-old Richard Stewart, was arrested and taken to the Riverside Police Department for booking, but had to be transported to MacNeal Hospital in Berwyn to be treated for alcohol poisoning, police said. When he was released back into police custody, a breathalyzer test showed his blood alcohol content at 0.358, more than 4 1/2 times the legal limit.
“This is the single highest breathalyzer blow Riverside Police has recorded in 2017,” Riverside Police Chief Tom Weitzel said in the statement.
Stewart, who lives in the Kenwood neighborhood on Chicago's South Side, was charged with two counts of DUI, improper lane usage and transportation and consumption of open alcohol while driving, police said.

Vincent Margera was ordered to “no longer be Don Vito” for 10 years by a Jefferson County District judge during a sentencing hearing today.
Margera, who played Don Vito on the MTV show, “Viva La Bam,” was found guilty in October of two counts of sexual assault on a child.
Judge M.J. Menendez, who sentenced Margera to 10 years probation, told him he could not attend autograph sessions, write books or appear on television shows.
The judge also ordered Margera to register as a sex offender, work on his substance abuse problems and receive a mental health evaluation.
Margera was charged with sexual assault in connection with an August 2006 photo and authograph-signing event at the Colorado Mills mall skate park.
Prosecutors said Margera grabbed the breasts and buttocks of three young girls. He was acquitted of one count of sexual abuse.

TIJERAS, N.M. (KRQE) - Officials say an elderly Tijeras man attacked by an intruder fought back, shooting that intruder dead.
Friday night neighbors were calling that man a hero.
"He did great," said Neighbor Jacob Johnson.
"He's an elderly guy so, that's a pretty big thing to survive," said Neighbor Szonja Johnson.
The Bernalillo County Sheriff's Department says it was about 5:30 Thursday afternoon when they were called to Campo Road. Deputies say that's where Sebastian Thompson, 48, broke into a home and attacked a 70-year-old man.
"I heard the cops come, and as it was evening, I tried to go the store, but this entire way was blocked off," said Neighbor Liam Wilson.
Deputies are not releasing where it happened but neighbors pointed out the home to KRQE News 13. They say seeing deputies surround it left them worried about their neighbor.
"He walks with a cane. He's kinda a bit older and has some issues. I think that a strong breeze would push him over," said Jacob Johnson.
BCSO says Thompson attacked the man with a bamboo stick and a hockey stick. The victim suffered a severe head injury but was able to shoot Thompson in the chest, using a .38 caliber hand gun. Thompson died at the scene.
Szonja Johnson said, "Good for him. That's awesome that he was able to think that fast and he was able to protect himself."
Wilson said, "The intruder got what he had coming to him."
Neighbors say this incident should serve as a warning for anyone else considering targeting their community.
"Thank god that he's armed and you know, most of us up here are. I hope people see this is not a good place to come for sure," said Jacob Johnson.
BCSO says no arrests have been made in this case and that it will be forwarded to the District Attorney's office, to determine if it was a justifiable homicide.
A search of the courts website did not show any criminal history for the suspect in this case.
We previously reported that the intruder's name was Sebastian Thomas due to information from Bernalillo County Sheriff's Department. BSCO now tells us his name was Sebastian Thompson. The correction has been made to the story above.
Share. After thirteen years lost in cyberspace, Bioshock's ancestor is back. After thirteen years lost in cyberspace, Bioshock's ancestor is back.
For the past decade something has been lurking amid the vast electronic tangle of cyberspace: a name whispered with a strange mixture of fondness and fear by those who remember it; a creation that reigned supreme at the tail end of the last Millennium, and then almost completely disappeared. Just a few days ago, however, it suddenly came back, determined to regain its former glory. I'm here to tell you why you should be afraid and delighted in equal measure.
The alluring monster in question is, of course, System Shock 2, often referred to as the spiritual predecessor to Bioshock, the game that earned Ken Levine a place in the virtual hall of fame. For more thirteen years, legal problems have kept it locked in cyberspace, inaccessible to anyone who didn't buy it in 1999. But now, finally, that's all be resolved, and Good Old Games has released a version of it optimised for modern PCs.
Bioshock and System Shock 2 are linked by far more than spirit. In both form and function, so much was carried over from the harrowing hallways of SS2's Von Braun to the underwater dystopia of Rapture. The spacecraft is divided into a sequence of open environments, each with its own particular flavour. The story is largely told through recordings made by the ship's inhabitants. Most of the crew have been infected by a hive-minded alien organism known as the Many, and are less extroverted, more unsettling versions of Bioshock's Splicers. The tools at your disposal range from conventional weapons to hacking abilities to psionic powers analogous to Bioshock's plasmids. It even has creepy vending machines.
“ Bioshock is a cataclysm within a circus, all action and spectacle, whereas System Shock 2 is about survival.
Yet whilst they are structurally similar, the two games play in strikingly different ways. The Bioshock games are a cataclysm within a circus, all action and spectacle, whereas System Shock 2 is about scavenging and survival. The former explores grand political and philosophical ideas, the latter simply presents to us a struggle for existence, as the squishy, organic Many clash with synthetic AI, with you trapped in the middle of this inedible sandwich.
Artificial Intelligence is a massive component of System Shock 2 on both narrative and mechanical levels. Built with Looking Glass' famous Dark engine, it utilised the same tech that powered Thief, and the standout feature of the Dark Engine was how its sound system was interwoven with its AI system. Consequently, AI could locate and respond to sounds made by the player, and even sounds made by other AI. This in turn influenced another major theme of the game: horror.
System Shock 2 is frequently cited as one of the scariest games ever made. Despite the suggestive title, however, it never really tries to shock you. Enemies patrol freely through the Von Braun's metal halls, and you frequently hear them before you see them. Nothing leaps out of vents making weird gargling noises a-la Dead Space. Instead of cheap thrills there is a constant sensation of dread, upheld by the knowledge that you are being perpetually hunted, that something might attack at any moment. Worse, the longer you hang around, the more desperate the own situation becomes as ammo, health and psionic energy are expended with each encounter.
Exit Theatre Mode
Pervading this oppressive atmosphere throughout is a deep underlying sense of wrongness. The ship's infected crewmembers apologise to you as they try to kill you. Escaped lab monkeys, their brains exposed through scientific experimentation, chatter pleasantly when unaware of your presence, but shriek with rage the moment they spot you. The Cyborg Midwives are the antithesis of birth and life, their womanhood replaced with cold, bloody steel. And the game is obsessed with worms, hiding them under every shelf and table, sometimes in huge writhing piles. Unlike most survival horror games, where you gradually numb to the unpleasant surroundings, the Von Braun becomes more unnerving the longer you spend trapped beneath its metal hull.
“ It's a challenge intended specifically to provoke defiance, for the player to demonstrate their freedom.
And, as if that wasn't enough, there is also the small matter of dealing with one of gaming's most infamous antagonists. Right at the outset, SHODAN challenges the player directly, and in a few brief sentences demonstrates everything which makes her so abhorrent and compelling, her vanity, her god-complex and her and contempt for any being seemingly less intelligent than herself. It's a challenge intended specifically to provoke defiance, for the player to demonstrate their freedom to act against her.
Only when SHODAN finally reveals herself does the significance of this become apparent. From that moment, the player is subject to her every whim, and knowingly so. She proposes an alliance to defeat the Many (and of course to regain the powers she lost in the first game). It's an alliance in which you have no choice, and so you follow her orders and complete her objectives while she taunts and belittles you. It's this complete control SHODAN appears to have over you, contradicting the game's own apparent freedom, that makes her such a memorable adversary.
Exit Theatre Mode
Fourteen years on, System Shock 2 feels remarkably fresh. The Dark Engine holds up far better here than it does in the original Thief. The clean lines, angles and surfaces of the Von Braun are well matched with late nineties 3D rendering, although character models look rather like the developers beat the polygons into shape with a tenderising mallet. The eerie, pulsating musical score from Eric Brosius also helps to keep things lively. The skills system shows its age in places – distinguishing between repairing weapons and maintaining them seems completely arbitrary, and the ending is weaker than a McDonald's coffee. The game is so strong otherwise though, that these issues can be easily forgiven.
“ System Shock 2 was probably the last great game of the twentieth century.
System Shock 2 was probably the last great game of the twentieth century, and it's desperately sad that a generation of gamers have missed out on it. I can't help but wonder how the development landscape might have been different had more gamers experienced it between Looking Glass' demise and the arrival of Bioshock. Its understanding of level design, storytelling and choice in play style is visible in so many fantastic games from Deus Ex to Dishonored, and wouldn't we all like a few more like those?
Nevertheless, it's wonderful to be able to play it again; and more importantly for newcomers to access it for the first time. Night Dive deserve a lot of respect for sifting through the rights wrangle between EA and Meadowbrook insurance group and rescuing it from legal limbo. System Shock 2 has been lost in the wild for too long, we should all be glad to see it finally shepherded from the darkness.

Sometimes, a seemingly meaningless post on Twitter can be more significant than the author ever intended.
That is exactly what happened when Erin Rose, founder of Positive Detroit, tweeted that all she wanted was a jar of McClure's Pickles and a bag of Better Made potato chips. Heck, she said, they should just make McClure's-flavored Better Made potato chips.
As Joe McClure, co-founder of Troy-based McClure's Pickles put it, 'That piqued the interest of Better Made who contacted me about creating a line of McClure's flavored potato chips'.
The two companies have been meeting regularly over the last month to create the right spice mix and have even made several batches of prototype chips. (I tried the garlic-dill flavored chips and they were delicious.)
"The guys from Better Made came here and tried our pickles and chatted. They told me that this is the same way Sam Cipriano (founder of Better Made) started."
There is no set timetable as to when the chips will hit stores, if they ever do, but Mark Winkelman, president of Better Made, said he is excited about the possibility.
Marvel's upcoming Black Panther film has a great cast of black actors and actresses. But when the film hits theaters in 2018, Samuel L. Jackson won't be there – and he's not happy about it.
Jackson has been the most notable black actor in the Marvel Universe, portraying Nick Fury in films like Captain America and Avengers. He told We Got This that he was upset at not being involved in the film.
“I asked them, ‘So you're doing Black Panther and the only black character in the Marvel Universe is not showing up?' And they're like, ‘Nick Fury is not in Wakanda!'” Jackson said. Wakanda is the fictional African country that T'Challa rules and protects as the Black Panther patriarch.
“How can he not know the other black superhero on the planet?” Jackson continued. “How the hell does that work? But they just said, ‘No you're not in that one.'”
It's tough to blame Jackson for being upset. The excitement for Black Panther after Chadwick Boseman's portrayal of T'Challa in Captain America: Civil War, with him having one of the film's strongest storylines and being one of the best fighters. The Black Panther film will have an incredible cast of black excellence, too: Boseman, Michael B. Jordan, Lupita Nyong'o, Forest Whitaker, Danai Gurira, Angela Bassett, and possibly Phylicia Rashad will all appear, and the film is directed by Ryan Coogler.
Hopefully, we'll see Jackson in a post-film bonus scene, or sometime in the Spider-Man film.

Why Spikeball May Just Be the Next Great American Sport
Spikeball is one of the fastest rising sports across America. From having not heard of it at all, to it being a consistent household name, it's certainly growing. I've personally played it alot, and it is quite fun, basically the perfect backyard sport. Chances are, you already know how it's played. If not, go take a look here for the rules. Spikeball is incredibly fun and is great to play at any venue, although grass and beach settings are highly recommended. It has a bright future, but is it the next great american sport?
Why Spikeball Has a Bright Future
It's a very fun, simple game. As Spikeball claims, it's like volleyball and foursquare had a baby and out popped Spikeball. My favorite part about it is it's ability to be played competitively. If you have even teams that are both relatively skilled, it can be a true back and forth match. It's not like volleyball where you need a bunch of players who all need to be engaged. In spikeball, all you need is four determined players, and in spikeball it's easy to stay competitive. It's a great sport to play at backyard barbecues, in gym class, or at the beach.
I can specifically remember my first spikeball experience. I was admittedly a little bit late to the Spikeball world and was very skeptical at first. My family and I were visiting some good family friends in Montauk, NY. On the first day, while grabbing chairs from the garage, my friend's dad exclaimed, “Don't forget Spikeball”. At that point I had heard vaguely of the sport but didn't think it was anything really that special. After a couple hours of basking in the warm sun, we decided to play. Sufficed to say, I had a freaking ball. It was me and my friend versus our two dads. That always brings out the best in me. It was very competitive. I was diving in the sand, yelling at my friend, and well quite simply being a certifiable hardo. From then on, I've purchased a Spikeball set of my own. Everytime I go to the beach, it's the first thing I bring, outside of headphones of course. Every time there's a barbecue or a backyard event, it's the first thing I bring. Spikeball is perfect for college kids on spring break. It's perfect for young kids fooling around in gym class. It's perfect for adults to play around during a barbecue. It requires a short space, four people, and may be just the perfect recreational backyard sport.
I think Spikeball has the potential to be the next great American sport. If you've played spike ball, you know what I'm talking about when I say it's a highly addictive, very fun game. You are moving, diving into the sand, and strategizing with your teammate. It can be fun played competitively using official spikeball rules, or just by fooling around on your own. No matter what, you will find yourself wanting more. Is Spikeball going to draw huge crowds as a spectator sport? Probably not, but that doesn't compromise Spikeball's ability to be played all the time and by everyone of all ages. Isn't that what a sport is all about? Every great American sport can be played in any venue, across all age groups and skill levels. This can be said for Baseball, Football and Basketball. The same can be said for Spikeball. Spikeball's ability to be played by anyone and anywhere, paired with being just super fun, makes it a great sport, and maybe….maybe the next great American sport.

Godzilla gets music festival for 60th birthday
It's a mark of how beloved and adored the great Godzilla is in his home country of Japan that the beastie will get a birthday music festival in his honour next January, in celebration of turning 60.
The creature, who originally wrecked havoc in Tokyo in a black-and-white film of the same name released in 1954, has spawned an entire franchise of subsequent movies and is a recognisable pop culture icon across the world.
There have been action figures, TV spin-offs, cartoons, and even appearances on The Simpsons - so perhaps it's little wonder that the people of Japan wanted to make sure Godzilla celebrated his sixtieth in style.
The event programme will be split into two separate parts, with the first comprising a live performance of Symphonic Fantasia No. 1, a 15-minute suite of various themes that Akira Ifukube composed for several Godzilla scores, as well as other monster movies produced by Toho in the 1950s and 1960s.
And who better to perform the piece than the Tokyo Philharmonic Orchestra, led by composer/conductor Kaoru Wada who happens to be an apprentice of the late Ifukube?
This segment will also feature a question and answer session with the star of the Godzilla 2000 film Shiro Sano, who has made reappearances in some of the subsequent incarnations as well.
The second part of the festival will feature a full showing of the original film, with the soundtrack provided once again by the Tokyo Philharmonic Orchestra, along with female chorus Chor June. All attendees will receive a special commemorative bookmark upon entry.
Seats are priced at 6,500 yen, 7,500 yen, or 8,500 each depending on where you want to seat and the event will take place at the NHK Hall in Tokyo. The doors open at 4:15pm and both long-running fans and newcomers alike are welcomed.

This summer, as with most years, is likely to see something of a sea change with regards to personnel as far as Arsenal's youngsters are concerned, with up to twelve players set to be released when their contracts expire at the end of next month and the possibility of several others joining them in departing.
It has already been revealed that there will be at least seven players continuing their education at London Colney full-time from July, with Gedion Zelalem, Tafari Moore, Ryan Huddart, Ainsley Maitland-Niles, Elliot Wright, Renny Smith and Stefan O'Connor having all secured scholarships with the club, but what of the players beyond them, who will add further depth to Carl Laraman's U18 squad next season?
Many members of the current Arsenal U16s and U15 squads, as well as some U14s, have found themselves drafted into the U18 set-up during the second half of this campaign, particularly during times when the team had several games in close proximity. Some have impressed, whilst others still have some physical and technical work to attend to before they make the step up on a permanent basis, but here is a run-down of some players who will still be schoolboys next season, but could make a profound impact at a higher level throughout the course of 2013/14.
Chris Toonga (U18 apps: 1) Central-midfielder Chris was one of many schoolboys to make their debut for the U18s in the defeat away to Manchester City in February, and the youngster demonstrated his ability to find a pass as well as a penchant for stealing the ball off opponents. He has featured several times for the U16s and could make the bench for the U18s on several occasions next season.
George Dobson (U18 apps: 7) Reportedly on the verge of a call-up to England U17s, George has become something of a regular presence in the U18 squad during the latter half of the campaign, impressing at both centre-back and in central midfield and making seven appearances in total at that level, four of which were starts. Economical in possession, especially when operating as a midfielder, he also has a knack for goals, as demonstrated by his strike in the U16s' 4-2 defeat to Everton at Emirates Stadium last weekend.
Chris Willock (U18 apps: 1) Another player who could soon receive international recognition with England, Chris has long been tipped as a player with a bright future. Although somewhat slight physically, he is extremely skilful and possesses an accurate shot and was named the Player of the Tournament at the prestigious MTU Indoor Cup last year.
Harry Donovan (U18 apps: 1) Still technically an U14, central midfielder Harry made his debut for the U18s as a substitute in the victory over Middlesbrough late last month. Very calm in possession and a good communicator, he should step up to the U16s on a regular basis from next season.
Harry Girling (U18 apps: 0) Born in early 1998, Harry is a promising goalkeeper who shone as the U15s drew with Everton last weekend. He has also featured for the U16s on several occasions and could find himself on the bench for the U18s at times during the next campaign.
Kaylen Hinds (U18 apps: 6) A hard-working striker with much potential, Kaylen is coming to the end of an impressive first season at the club, having joined from Leyton Orient. He has demonstrated his ability during his fleeting appearances for the U18s thus far and, should Jordan Brown depart, could have an even bigger role to play at that level next season.
Marc Bola (U18 apps: 2) A left-winger when he signed for the club, Marc has since been transformed into a resolute centre-back, and is also capable of operating at left-back. He broke into the U18 side earlier this season and has continued his good form for the U16s.
Olufela Olomola (U18 apps: 1) A powerful striker of Nigerian descent, Olufela has continued to develop apace this season and could feature on several occasions for the U18s next season, having made his debut at that level this season.
Ovie Ejaria (U18 apps: 0) A simple and effective ball-player, Ovie has progressed through the ranks at Arsenal and has now settled as a central midfielder having previously been used in a multitude of different positions.
Stephy Mavididi (U18 apps: 2) Another physically-imposing forward, Stephy is a clinical marksman and is adept at shrugging off his marker. He will be hopeful of making more U18 appearances next season as he attempts to earn a scholarship.
Tyrell Robinson (U18 apps: 3) Capable of playing at left-back, or, indeed, further forward, Tyrell scored a spectacular free-kick, which was followed by a spectacular celebration, as the U16s lost out to Everton last weekend. He has adapted well to U18 football, but remains behind Brandon Ormonde-Ottewill in the pecking order at that level.
There are plenty of other players to keep an eye on who are currently progressing through the system at Hale End, but these players mentioned are those who could be somewhat more familiar names in a year's time.

Update (December 1, 2016): Salem State University reopened its “State of the Union” art exhibit, Inside Higher Ed reports. However, at least one of the exhibit's most controversial paintings depicting Ku Klux Klan members is now displayed fully enclosed by black drapes.
Students & controversial art: #SalemState reopens exhibit, MICA involves students in displaying piece on the KKK https://t.co/YWnrPFmKjH pic.twitter.com/AtMIVPGg1Y — Inside Higher Ed (@insidehighered) December 1, 2016
We'll keep you posted on this developing story.
Massachusetts' Salem State University has agreed to temporarily close an art exhibit intended to draw attention to the evils of discrimination after students said they were offended by the images the artist used to do so. The move is the latest in a growing trend of student-driven demands to censor art.
As reported today in Inside Higher Ed, Salem State students complained to school officials and on social media about images in an election-inspired exhibit called “State of the Union” at the school's Winfisky Gallery that included photo illustrations of the Ku Klux Klan and of Jews arrested after the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising in German-occupied Poland during World War II. The artist, Garry Harley, told Inside Higher Ed he used the startling images to criticize President-Elect Donald Trump's discussion of minorities during his presidential campaign.
According to a timeline posted by Salem State, the school first learned about “students' objections to the exhibit” on November 16. The following Monday, the school held a discussion attended by about 50 students, faculty, staff, gallery curator Ken Reker, and Harley, after which the school decided to temporarily close the exhibit.
In a joint statement the next day, Mary Melilli, Chair of the school's Art + Design program and Reker jointly apologized for the display:
We would like to apologize to those in the campus community who have experienced distress resulting from this exhibit. We are sorry. Yesterday's conversation made clear the strong emotions this exhibit has caused. […] Art is often intended to spark discussion about societal ills. In this case, it did just that, but we deeply regret the distress it has caused students. We thank the students for sharing their views, and we look forward to working with them to determine how to move forward.
But Harley, the artist, told Inside Higher Ed that the discussion leading to the closure raised troubling questions about whether the students calling for removal of his work had really engaged with it, and whether Salem State prioritized freedom of expression:
Harley explained that he viewed his art as warning about the dangers of Trump's rhetoric and that he viewed art as a tool with which to spread alarm. But he said that “the anger of the students sort of overwhelmed” what he was trying to say. […] “I saw a lot of projected anger in the room, and it had nothing to do with a thoughtful understanding of the piece,” he said. Harley said that he thought Salem State was surprised by the students' anger. Part of displaying art at a campus, he said, is defending free expression “and they weren't prepared to do that.”
The Salem News reports that a meeting for faculty and students to discuss the future of the exhibit is scheduled for tomorrow at 3:30 p.m. The meeting is closed to the public and the press.
The idea that censoring art is a bad idea is fairly firmly entrenched in the American psyche—and the law prohibits public entities from doing it—but that hasn't stopped campuses in recent years from doing it anyway.
This summer, FIRE and the National Coalition Against Censorship asked the University of Wisconsin–Stout to reconsider its plan to display paintings of Native Americans in a “controlled environment.” The school had initially agreed to remove the paintings altogether after students complained the depictions reinforced negative stereotypes about native people.
Last year, an art student at the State University of New York at Buffalo, intending to inspire conversation on race, hung “black only” and “white only” signs on campus restrooms. Instead, she inspired backlash from fellow students, some of whom called campus police.

In 2014, the University of Iowa apologized for not responding sooner to student and faculty complaints over a large statue of a Ku Klux Klan member that visiting professor Serhat Tanyolacar created using newspaper clippings describing racial violence. Students and faculty said the piece constituted “hate speech.” We pointed out at the time that both UI's own policy and First Amendment jurisprudence indicated the piece was protected expression. As my colleague Susan Kruth wrote at the time, it was “speech that, if tolerated, might have contributed to a productive discussion.”
Earlier that year, we commented on the controversy surrounding the “Sleepwalker” statue at Wellesley College by sculptor Tony Matelli. Some students worried that the piece might “trigger” student-victims of sexual assault. Author Lenore Skenazy observed in an analysis in the Wall Street Journal that “Art is a trigger.”
Administrators must resist giving in to these demands. On public campuses, many of these art projects are protected by the First Amendment, and on private campuses that promise free expression, schools must uphold those promises.
Art is a unique medium. It may be the only vehicle to convey an idea or expression in the precise way the artist intends. Many times, art provokes intense, uncomfortable emotions. Many times, art offends. And many times, that's the point.
Students should be encouraged to thoughtfully engage with art installations like the one at Salem State. If offended, they should respond with their own expression, not censorship.
Artists on campus who have been censored should contact FIRE.

Since taking a medical retirement more than 15 months ago Thomas Tyner has been as busy as any college kid. He's attended classes at the University of Oregon. He's gone fishing and hunting for birds. And now, he's making a football comeback.
It will come in an Oregon State uniform.
Tyner requested his release from the University of Oregon on Friday. At 9 a.m. on Saturday morning it became official and the former five-star running back who once rushed for 644 yards and scored 10 touchdowns in a single game for Aloha High School prepared to talk with Beavers coach Gary Andersen about playing for OSU next season.
"I've wanted to be a Beaver my whole life," Tyner said.
It's been a long road back for Tyner, who suffered two shoulder injuries and sat out the entire 2015 season before quitting football in Feb. 2016. His right shoulder (torn labrum) was injured his sophomore season of high school football. His left, blown to pieces by Washington's Shaq Thompson on a kickoff his sophomore college season, had a floating bone fragment in the joint.
"I feel 100 percent," he said on Saturday. "I've had two years of being free, not doing any sports or anything. I think it's time for me to get back. My football career didn't end the way I wanted it to and I think I owe it to myself and everyone who looked up to me.
"I wasn't satisfied with how it ended."
When Tyner took the medical retirement at age 21 I wondered in print if he might return to football some day. I wondered how much of his departure from the sport he loved had to do with what a high-stakes game it had turned into during his time at Oregon. When Tyner was injured the Ducks had a loaded backfield, led by Royce Freeman. And so when Tyner slipped out of uniform with those two bad shoulders, it was a series of small steps from the huddle to UO training room to being gone from football altogether.
He's a thoughtful kid with a pile of interests outside of athletics. Tyner is uncomfortable with the spotlight, and doesn't like to be in front of a microphone. He doesn't even really follow sports. Tyner is the anti-celebrity, born into a 5-foot-11, 201-pound bowling-ball of a body. His speed and strength made him great at football, but he mostly wanted to hunt and fish.
He's messaged me often in the last 12 months, announcing, "Let's get some Fall Chinook!" and on another occasion, "I'm hunting today, won't be on the phone much."
Then, something interesting happened.
Tyner started talking and thinking about football again. He was on campus at Oregon going to school, but following Oregon State's 4-8 season closely. Could he really make a comeback after two full seasons off? And would he really be willing to jump across a Civil War rivalry and suit up in his final season of eligibility for OSU?
"I used to go to their games all the time as a kid," Tyner said.
The NCAA prohibits a medical retiree from returning to play at that same university. He couldn't play at Oregon. It's not an option. So really this isn't about a player picking the Beavers over the Ducks. That's how it will be cast in some households, but not in Tyner's. This decision is more about Tyner deciding he was not going to sit around the rest of his life mired in regret.
Tyner, who totaled 1,284 rushing yards and 14 touchdowns in two seasons at Oregon, tweeted on Thursday: "'What if,' I hate that thought."
As a columnist, I nearly fell out of my chair.
I knew Tyner was working out. I was aware he explored the NCAA rules, locating a provision on his own that allows an underclassman who haven't participated in two full sports seasons to transfer and be eligible immediately. But what I didn't know was whether Tyner would actually do it, and that tweet was his first public hint.
"This says nothing against Oregon. This is a regret thing. He just wants to get back to football," his father, John Tyner, said.
Oregon State has Ryan Nall in the backfield. Nall and Tyner could be a next-level combination for Andersen's offense. It would solve an immediate need -- a 4.28-second, 40-yard burner to complement Nall's bruising running style.
"Hopefully, I can run that again," Tyner said of the 40-yard time.
Where does he fit at OSU next season? How much does the running back have left? Those are questions now for Tyner and the Beavers coaching staff. He isn't worried about whether or not Oregon State has a scholarship for him. He's willing to walk-on, but I doubt it will come to that.
"Man, I'm so far gone from football right now," Tyner told me last summer.
"I can't wait to play again," he said last week.
Tyner has been granted his release by the University of Oregon. That's the big news today. Three more weeks of school. One month left on the apartment lease in Eugene. Then, he'll transfer to Oregon State and try to make a comeback. We've seen nothing like this in our state's college football history. It's been said people go to college to figure out who they are. We're watching Tyner do just that, possibly in uniform at both Oregon and Oregon State.
It's a fascinating study.
On Saturday morning, I worked to confirm the details of Tyner's plans. For hours, I couldn't reach him. Nobody could. Turns out he was volunteering for his old high school, working in Aloha with elementary-school kids at a 5-kilometer fun run.
"Just helping a bunch of kids and having fun," Tyner said.
He confirmed the comeback, and that Oregon State is the only program he's interested in playing for.
"Life starts hitting you once you're about to graduate," he said. "I just wasn't satisfied. I have to do this."

The tax on tampons will end a lot sooner than anyone was expecting. Tory MP Michelle Rempel tabled a motion in the House of Commons Thursday to exempt feminine hygiene products from the federal portion of the GST, beginning July 1.

“For me personally, whenever we have the opportunity to put more money in the pockets of Canadians, and certainly Canadian women, that's a very good thing,” Rempel said. After decades of campaigns to end the tax, the movement quickly gained cross-party support in the house with the aid of a cadre of female Conservative MPs. “If there's one thing there's gender equality on in our caucus, it's that everybody supports tax reductions for Canadians,” Rempel said.

The quest to end the tax on tampons gained attention earlier this year thanks to an online petition with more than 70,000 people calling for change. Jill Piebiak, the organizer of the petition, said she was a bit surprised at how quickly the motion became law, and attributes it to the female Conservative MPs who put pressure on the government to act now, not later. “We are ecstatic,” she said, noting that today is menstrual hygiene day. “It's so exciting to know that on July 1 these products will be more affordable for women.” Earlier this month, the House of Commons unanimously passed a motion to call for an end to the tax, but it was not expected to be introduced until the next budget.
The motion was introduced by NDP MP Irene Mathyssen, who championed the cause in a 2013 private members bill. “I feel great; it's one of those unexpected little victories,” she said. “I thought we were going to have to struggle through the next four weeks trying to push the issue.”

Mathyssen attributed the speed of change to the popular petition as well as women in the Conservative caucus. “When the women are angry, watch out,” she said. The Canadian Press reported that several female MPs told their fellow Tories that the caucus better support the motion, or they'd boycott a vote on May 11. “There's a lot of hyperbole on the Hill,” Rempel said, insisting that the Tories only waited to make sure the tax cut wouldn't interfere with their promise to balance the budget. Removing the tax has been estimated to cost the government $33 million. Mathyssen had inherited the bill from outgoing MP Judy Wasylycia-Leis, who had been pushing for an end to the tax in private members bills dating back to 2003. Wasylycia-Leis has said that as a feminist and a politician, she felt compelled to push the issue forward. “I saw it as a gender-based tax,” she said. “It was to me a discrimination against women.” Rempel wouldn't say that the tax was discriminatory, but said that putting tampons in the same category as other exempted necessities was a “no-brainer.” With files from The Canadian Press
DC Dumps Bill To Force Uber Into High Prices; Complains That The Bill Was To Help Uber
from the regulatory-capture dept
"Several months ago, Uber contacted me and asked to work together to legalize services like Uber in the District... Since then, I have met with Uber many times, negotiated in good faith, and believed that I had reached an agreement with them last week."
Earlier today, we wrote about the city of Washington DC working on a a bill that would require startup car service Uber to charge five times as much as a cab, arguing that they need to regulate what is considered a "premium class." They don't explain why one needs to regulate what's premium and what's not, but that's what you get in a massively regulated/anti-competitive market. The public outcry over this regulation, however, has resulted in the Councilmember who wrote the amendment, Mary Cheh, backing down and shelving it As we noted in our earlier post, Cheh had said all along that the amendment was actually an attempt toUber, after a Taxicab Commission "sting" earlier this year, which claimed that Uber was acting illegally. In response to all of this, Cheh seems upset, since she says that she workedUber to create the amendment, and was blindsided by the criticism:Others have suggested that parts of the amendment could be acceptable if they remove the minimum pricing rules. Uber, for its part, claims that it's always believed the service was legal in DC, so it never believed that the amendment was needed to "make it legal." For what it's worth Uber clearly has benefited from this fight, as it drew an awful lot of publicity to the company's presence in DC (and elsewhere). Either way, it seems difficult to see how regulating a high price benefits Uber.And, in the end, what you're left with are questions about why taxi licensing needs to be so restrictive and so all-encompassing. Are there concerns about keeping passengers from being ripped off and keeping them safe? Sure, but there seem to be ways to deal with that which don't involve entirely regulating every aspect of the market, limiting competition and setting the actual pricing. But, in the end, as we've seen in other markets , those in regulated markets tend to figure out ways to use the regulations to their own advantage...

Research, economics, and politics suggest Enterprise Zones don't work, MU experts say
politics suggest Enterprise Zones don't work, MU experts say
COLUMBIA, 8/29/12 (Beat Byte) -- Two University of Missouri economics professors have sharply criticized Enhanced Enterprise Zones (EEZ), the blight-based tax incentive program Columbia City Hall and business lobby REDI have embraced as yet another "tool in the toolkit" to lure out-of-area businesses to the community.
Joseph Haslag, who directs the ; and Two University of Missouri economics professors have sharply criticized Enhanced Enterprise Zones (EEZ), the blight-based tax incentive program Columbia City Hall and business lobby REDI have embraced as yet another "tool in the toolkit" to lure out-of-area businesses to the community., who directs the Mizzou Economic and Policy Analysis Research Center and Judith Stallmann , a professor of applied economics at the Truman School of Public Affairs , panned the Blight/EEZ program in separate forums this month.
is a bad idea," Haslag wrote in an August 2012 do not exist, leaving Columbians with higher taxes, fewer services -- or both -- and an economy that is no stronger than it would have been without an EEZ."
very few discernible impacts."
No Free Lunch "What does research tell us about their effectiveness?" Stallmann asked -- and answered -- during a CAT TV program , EEZ: What are the costs and benefits for Columbia. "Early research was positive, but later research, when methods and data have been improved, generally show." "The Enhanced Enterprise Zone (EEZ) in Columbia," Haslag wrote in an August 2012 Columbia Business Times editorial that also appeared in abridged format in the Columbia Daily Tribune. "The necessary conditions for EEZ to help the city's economic development, leaving Columbians with higher taxes, fewer services -- or both -- and an economy that is no stronger than it would have been without an EEZ."
"Job-creation rhetoric aside," the EEZ "is not a kind of free lunch for city economic development," Haslag explains.
It redirects investment and taxpayer resources away from certain groups and businesses -- like schools and homegrown startups -- and toward businesses receiving the incentives, putting its overseers -- the Blight Boards that select which businesses qualify -- in the role of mini-Warren Buffets, trying to pick winners and losers.
"The likelihood that an EEZ Board could outperform the marketplace in redirecting taxpayer money to selected enterprises is about as high as the chance that I could pick the jack of diamonds from a pack of playing cards on my first try," Haslag writes. "The deck is stacked against the EEZ Board."
For investors in any enterprise to be successful, they need two critical ingredients: lots of investment options, like the hundreds of stocks in a mutual fund or the dozens of startups in a venture capital portfolio; and skin in the game -- their own money at risk, for instance.
But those ingredients are missing from the EEZ program. The incentive program exists because so few companies want to relocate or expand, not because so many companies are clamoring for CoMo.
rojects the EEZ Board will be asked to consider will be too small," Haslag says. "And the EEZ board does not have any skin in the game," Haslag writes. "The careful vetting that occurs when people are spending their own money will be missing." Therefore, "the set of projects the EEZ Board will be asked to consider," Haslag says. "And the EEZ board," Haslag writes. "The careful vetting that occurs when people are spending their own money will be missing."
Finally, Haslag addresses fears of eminent domain abuse that come with blight decrees. The Enterprise Zone must be blighted to qualify for the tax breaks.
"Columbia officials are being truthful when they say eminent domain abuses are the farthest thing from their minds," Haslag writes. But once on the books, "there are no restrictions on future city governments that see opportunities."
Research refutes EEZ
Stallmann answered a question from CAT TV host Jim Robertson that went to the core of the EEZ program: Will companies relocate to an area with an EEZ? Does the incentive really and truly bring home the bacon? "The research tends to show that it doesn't work out that way," explained Stallmann, an expert in public finance and community economic development. She cited studies of enterprise zones in 13 different states, including five zones in Missouri. Firms that relocate to the community for the incentive might well have relocated without it, she said. "Some high percentage of firms probably would have located there anyway, so you're paying them to do something they would have done anyway," she explained. Or, the EEZ-subsidized firm "may locate in the zone when they would have located somewhere else in the same city or somewhere else quite nearby, so that once again, there's very little net gain," she said. Stallmann also pointed to conditions that don't exist in Columbia to the same extent they do in other EEZs. High poverty, high unemployment, deteriorating infrastructure, and lack of transportation to jobs outside big cities originally motivated the enterprise zone movement, she told Robertson and two other panelists, CiViC member Dan Cullimore and REDI director Mike Brooks (top picture).
Of the few EEZ successes, most are in "states that have limited their zones, making the zones more unique," she added.
Missouri, in contrast, has 119 EEZs, Brooks explained.
SirPsycho Editorials/Opinion, Holiday Specials aretha franklin, atari, billy mays, colecovision, intellivision, Nintendo, retro commercials, target, Video Games, why did i play this
The 80's were a much simpler time for video gaming, especially the earlier you go. The same can be said for the advertisements for said video games and their consoles. Since we're getting so close the holiday that most exemplifies consumerism and capitalism, let's take a look at what some video game manufacturers and/or retailers aired during commercial breaks and give them a quick analysis.
Atari
These early commercials were just as cliched as other commercials at the time, and as simple as the games they were advertising, maybe a sign of American advertisers and their constant safe bet of mass market appeal.
Oh man, I'm so sorry. I fell asleep watching this because of BOREDOM.
These Atari commercials would be so much more entertaining with Billy Mays. “HI BILLY MAYS HERE AND YOU SHOULD BUY ATARI 2600 VIDEO GAMES! CHECK OUT STAR RAIDERS, SWORDQUEST, MS. PAC-MAN AND OTHERS AT PAY N'SAVE TO GET CRAZY CHRISTMAS DEALS! IF YOU GO SHOPPING TODAY YOU'LL RECEIVE A BOTTLE OF ORANGE GLO FOR FREE!
BUT WAIT THERE'S MORE!”
We agreed to never speak of this incident again! No seriously I am contractually obligated to never mention ET for the Atari 2600 ever. Screw the contract, this is the most hellish, torturing commercial for any Atari fan that could possibly exist. They should have buried the commercials in the desert with the games! That said It's still a boring as hell advert.
Colecovision
Come buy a Colecovision and a bunch of random games from Hills for your lovely Christmas. Also buy Atari and Intellivision games because we love to namedrop and we need to LIQUIDATE EVERYTHING FOR THE HOLIDAYS WHOOOO!
Nintendo
When Nintendo was on the scene the Wild West days of the 70's and early 80's was over. There was a new sheriff in town and they weren't going to let anybody rustle their cattle.
Hi, I'm Target and I paid Aretha Franklin a lot of money to sing a little jingle and appear in this Nintendo commercial. SHOP HERE PLEASE! That said this is much better than the early 80's fare, Aretha Franklin and her amazing voice keeps my attention and really puts me in the Christmas spirit. I like this one a lot.
Oh man if I was a kid in the late 80's, instead of being an infant when this commercial came out, I would have made my parents buy so much Pepsi. In fact I should have a new endorsement contract coming out since I ended the other one.
Stay tuned later this week to see what happened when the 90's came into being.

"We've a mission for you. A major weapons test is imminent. We need to know how to destroy it."
–Mon Mothma
Star Wars teaches us many things. It teaches us about the conflicts between good and evil, about choosing our destinies, and about the value of friendship. It also teaches us about the value of good military intelligence.
By now, Star Wars fans everywhere understand how powerful and deadly a weapon the Death Star was. Its superlaser destroyed the planet Alderaan in an instant. We also know that Grand Moff Tarkin and the Empire had planned to use the Death Star to destroy the Rebellion's secret base and crush the Rebellion. And we know that those plans were thwarted largely by Luke Skywalker when he blew up the Death Star by firing a proton torpedo into the station's thermal exhaust port.
What we might sometimes overlook, though, is the fact that Luke wouldn't have been able to take his shot if the Rebellion's analysts hadn't first identified the Death Star's vulnerability. And those analysts wouldn't have been able to identify that vulnerability if they hadn't been able to review the Death Star's schematics.
The theft of the Death Star's schematics had a monumental impact upon the shape of the Galactic Civil War, and Rogue One soon promises to regale us with the tale of those Rebel spies charged to steal them—Jyn Erso, Cassian Andor, Bodhi Rook, and their crew.
But even before the movie makes its way to the theaters, you'll have the chance to bring these heroes to your tabletop and fly them to battle aboard the new U-wing from the new X-Wing™ U-wing Expansion Pack!
Move the Team into Position
You will find no fewer than half a dozen unique Rebels represented among the ship cards and upgrades in the U-wing Expansion Pack. Like Jyn Erso and Cassian Andor, these cards represent some of the Rebellion's most talented and daring spies and pilots, and most of them come with abilities that target ships within prescribed Range bands.
This is only natural when you consider that the Incom UT-60D, or U-wing, was designed as a sturdy troop transport and gunship, meant to get soldiers safely into dangerous positions and then provide them with air support. This is the role the ship provides in X-Wing, as well, with its two crew upgrade slots and its dual-sided Pivot Wing upgrade, which allows you to stop your U-wing in a dangerous position before turning it around and racing it into battle at full speed and with increased agility.
While the U-wing may first catch your eye with its miniature's moveable wings, its dual-sided Pivot Wing Title, and its hefty stat line, there's a lot more to the ship.
First of all, you have the fact that the ship's stat line is variable. Presuming you consider the ship's non-unique, zero-cost Title an integral part of the ship, the U-wing is then the first ship to make its way to X-Wing with a variable stat line; it's one agility when its wings are in Landing position and two agility when its wings are in Attack position.
an integral part of the ship, the U-wing is then the first ship to make its way to X-Wing with a variable stat line; it's one agility when its wings are in Landing position and two agility when its wings are in Attack position. Then you have the ship's maneuver dial , which looks a lot like the Lambda-class shuttle's dial, but with a little extra speed and a lot less red. While the Pivot Wing Title adds to the ship's maneuverability in Landing mode, it's still a challenging dial, which makes it a bit more interesting that the U-wing is a large-base ship with only a forward firing arc and that comes with a couple of cards that suggest its use in "blocking" tactics.

Finally, you have the ship's system upgrade and torpedo slots, as well as a number of synergistic pilot abilities, all of which encourage more exploration of the Rebellion's combination-based squad designs.
Gather Actionable Intelligence
Several of the pilot and crew abilities from the U-wing Expansion Pack play on the themes of military espionage in ways that translate nicely to your games of X-Wing. These include the Cassian Andor crew ability, the ability for the Heff Tobber ship card, and the abilities for both the pilot and crew versions of Bodhi Rook.
Fans already noted how the Cassian Andor crew upgrade's ability allows your U-wing to block not just one, but both of an enemy ship's most likely flight paths. Play Cassian Andor aboard a ship with a low pilot skill value—or equipped with the Enhanced Scopes system upgrade—and you can set your dial to intercept the maneuver you expect your opponent's ship is most likely to execute.
Then at the end of the Planning phase, you can second guess yourself, naming the other maneuver you figured your opponent might take. If this second guess is right, Cassian Andor allows you to change his ship's maneuver, either to intercept the enemy ship or to fly into pursuit of it.
Because, as three-time World Champion Paul Heaver mentioned in his guide to "blocking," you want to block with a ship that features a low pilot skill value, Cassian Andor will likely show up with a good measure of frequency on the Blue Squadron Pathfinder and Heff Tobber. These pilots feature pilot skill values of "2" and "3," respectively—low enough to block most unique pilots, and even a good number of non-unique pilots.
Heff Tobber is a particularly interesting option as a blocker paired with Cassian Andor because his unique pilot ability rewards you with another of the sort of incremental advantages that you hope to gain by blocking in the first place. "After an enemy ship executes a maneuver that causes it to overlap your ship, you may perform a free action."
This means that if Heff Tobber is blocking effectively each round, he can perform his attacks with the modifications provided by both the focus and target lock abilities. Moreover, he could potentially gain even more actions if he were able to block more than one enemy ship and were carrying crew upgrades like Jyn Erso or Lando Calrissian, who feature action-based abilities.
Alternatively, Heff Tobber and Cassian Andor could even line up fully modified shots against the ships they deny actions if they fly together with the "Zeb" Orrelios crew upgrade from the Ghost Expansion Pack. With Cassian Andor, "Zeb" Orrelious, Enhanced Scopes, Anti-Pursuit Lasers, and the Pivot Wing Title, Heff Tobber's U-wing is both a high-powered blocker and an effective combatant.
Of course, Cassian Andor does more than enable blockers. When flying with pilots with higher pilot skill values, such as Rey, Dash Rendar, or Kanan Jarrus, Cassian Andor can help you avoid your opponent's efforts to block your ship. Simultaneously, he can help you keep your enemy in arc, allowing you to to make use of Rey's special ability or the Ghost's massive four-die primary weapon.
Finally, both the pilot and crew versions of Bodhi Rook permit an extension of your target lock action. While you can normally acquire a target lock only on a ship within Range "1–3" of you, Bodhi Rook makes it possible to acquire a target lock within Range "1–3" of any friendly ship. As a crew upgrade, Bodhi Rook grants this ability only to his ship, but as a pilot, Bodhi Rook extends this ability to every ship in your squadron.
Accordingly, when you have Bodhi Rook flying his U-wing in battle, you could send in an A-wing to scout the battlefield before setting up a wave of missile fire from your Bandit Squadron Pilots. Thanks to Bodhi Rook's ability, you could hold these relatively fragile Z-95 Headhunters back outside of Range "3" from the enemy on the round you grant them target locks and then send them forward to unleash their missiles with focus and Guidance Chips .
Another alternative would be to fly Bodhi Rook in the same squadron as the Rebel informant you position near your opponent's forces inside of her Captured TIE. Since your opponent would need a minimum pilot skill value of "9" to fire upon Ahsoka Tano with Veteran Instincts and Captured TIE, you could send her ahead of the rest of your squadron. Working with Bodhi Rook, Ahsoka lets you grab target locks with Shara Bey and the rest of your squadron, and if she ever catches your opponent's pilot saddled with stress, she could use her Black Market Slicer Tools to inflict damage—all without firing a shot.
Total Squad Points: 100
Inspire a Rebellion
How will you make use of the intel you gain with the pilots and crew members from the U-wing Expansion Pack? If you're with Jyn Erso and the expansions other Inspiring Recruits, you'll use everything you've got to stand against the Empire's tyranny. You'll find a way to fight the odds. You'll inspire the Rebellion.

Bitcoin Black Friday grew out of last year's Bitcoin Friday event, organized by Bitcoin evangelist Jon Holmquist. Over 75 merchants participated, helping gain much needed attention and legitimacy for Bitcoin.
This year, Holmquist co-organized with viral Internet freedom activists Fight for the Future to throw the event. Fight for the Future are best known for organizing the first protest against SOPA, and creating vibrant online campaigns in defense of the Internet and basic rights.
“Bitcoin Black Friday is an awesome way to bring the whole Internet community together at a time when Bitcoin needs as much mainstream attention as possible,” said Holmes Wilson, co-founder of Fight for the Future, “Even though it seems like Bitcoin is going strong, it won't be politically safe until it's widely used by average Internet users — that's already happening, but we're speeding things up with Bitcoin Black Friday, and making it fun in the process.”
“Whenever you use a bank account, credit card, or Paypal there are hidden fees. Lots of the time you don't see them, but sellers do. They're invisibly making everything more expensive,” said Tiffiniy Cheng of Fight for the Future, “Financial services get a cut of everything, for doing no work.”
“With everything we've learned about government surveillance in the last few months, it's easy to understand why more people and businesses are turning to Bitcoin,” Cheng noted, “It makes it a lot harder to profile you based on your purchases… it's more like cash. Because of that, Bitcoin is more than just money, it supports free speech and social change.”
Many feel that Bitcoin disrupts some of the exploitation of the financial services industry: “When workers send money home to family abroad, Western Union takes a huge cut– even though these remittances are the lifeblood of many poor countries,” said Holmes Wilson, “Financial services charge the biggest fees to those who can least afford it. But Bitcoin levels the playing field and brings fees to almost zero.”
The Bitcoin Black Friday website has an FAQ for people who are new to Bitcoin, and explains how easy it is to get some of the digital currency so average internet users can access the Bitcoin Black Friday deals. The wide range of merchants ensures that visitors can buy all sorts of things with Bitcoin including airline tickets, organic coffee, diamond jewelry, web hosting, tax preparation services, clothing, gift cards to major retailers, and even christmas trees.
Amidst the shopping craze, visitors to the Bitcoin Black Friday site will also have the opportunity to donate their bitcoins to a variety of worthy charities and non-profits including Sea Sheperd (as seen in Whale Wars on AnimalPlanet), Sean's Outpost, Songs of Love, and the Boys and Girls Club of Santa Monica. The BitGive Foundation — a new non-profit that collects bitcoins and distributes them to public health and environmental charities — will be accepting Bitcoin donations on behalf of Save the Children to aid in disaster relief efforts in the Philippines.
Madeline Finch, Board Member and Secretary of the Foundation says, “We are excited to be a part of Bitcoin Black Friday and to bring a charitable aspect to this already alternative event. And Save the Children and their relief efforts in the Philippines is exactly where we want to see our donation drive make a big difference.”
“Bitcoin is a great tool for merchants at every level,” says Jon Holmquist, who organized last year's Bitcoin Friday event, ”because it is decentralized (making it nearly free to send and receive money) the deals merchants can offer are a lot lower than any deals they've been able to offer before.”
Bitcoin Black Friday is backed by a solid circle of Bitcoin believers including the Bitcoin Investment Fund, Silicon Valley Angel, and Ribbit Capital. It is sponsored by merchants Private Internet Access, Gyft, BitDazzle, and the Bitcoin payment processors BitPay and Coinbase.

DeMarcus Cousins, you have some explaining to do.
The NBA is likely to come calling on the Sacramento Kings star big man on Thursday. And it may not be good news for the Kings chances of winning against the Miami Heat.
At the two minute mark of the first quarter, Cousins lost his composure for a moment while fighting for rebounding position in the post. The result was a tangle up that led to an extended elbow to the left jaw of Al Horford.
The Hawks All-Star big man wasn't knocked to the floor, nor was he bloodied. Cousins didn't wind up and drop a hammer to an opponent or throw a close handed punch, but that may not matter.
It was a heat of battle move by Cousins, but one that is likely to induce further examination by the league. The fact that the elbow was above the shoulders could add to the severity of the punishment.
Cousins has been a statistical wonder when healthy. He came into Wednesday's game averaging 28 points per game, which ranked third in the league and his 11 rebounds per contest rank in the top ten.
[INSTANT REPLAY: Kings' winning streak ends with loss in Atlanta]
There is a chance that Cousins will escape without a suspension. The NBA can assess a “Flagrant 2” without calling for game(s) missed. It should be noted that the Kings are 0-4 this season without their All-Star center and 11-37 all-time when he sits due to injury, illness or suspension.
THE GOOD:
Darren Collison returned for the Kings after missing five games with a strained left hamstring. The veteran point guard wasn't quite himself as he plays back into game shape, but the Kings desperately need his presence on the court.
The 28-year-old guard finished the night with seven points on 3-for-9 shooting from the field and 1-of-3 from behind the arc. He clearly didn't have his wind or his legs under him, but he gave Karl an alternative to playing Rondo 40-plus minutes, which is a welcomed break.
The loss to the Hawks marked the second time this season that the team faced an opponent with their core rotation intact. Cousins missed four games with an Achilles issue. Gay has missed two games, one due to the birth of a child and a second after a bout with gastroenteritis.
THE BAD:
At some point, the Sacramento Kings are going to have to learn to value the ball. This isn't a team filled with young players trying to prove they are something that they are not. This is a veteran laden team that makes poor basketball decisions that lead to losses.
Sacramento came into the contest against Atlanta ranked 26th in the league in turnovers at 17.1 per contest. In a six point loss that was decided in the final 30 seconds of the game, the Kings turned the ball over 21 times, including seven in the fourth quarter.
“It's a good team,” George Karl said during postgame. “Atlanta has good defensive hands and they lead the league in creating possessions.”
For the third time in 12 games with the Kings, point guard Rajon Rondo turned the ball over seven or more times. Wednesday against the Hawks, most of his seven mistakes were unforced.
It's hard to fault a guy who just posted a fourth triple-double in the last six games, but there has to come a point when making the simple play means more to this team. Rondo averages 4.2 turnovers per game which ranks him in the top five in the league. He also sits in second place in the NBA in assists at 9.6 per night, so there is a give and take with these stats.
The road is an unfriendly place to play and giving away possessions doesn't help any team, especially not one that has dug a hole for themselves like the Kings.
THE TAKE:
Despite turning the ball over 21 times, the Kings went toe-to-toe with one of the best the Eastern Conference has to offer. Sacramento had the advantage over the Hawks in almost every statistical category, including field goal percentage, 3-point percentage, rebounding and assists.
The Kings are team that is still building chemistry, but it isn't hard to see a path to success. The road is a perfect place to bond with your teammates. It's also a very difficult place to pick up wins.
Sacramento's remaining four games on their season-long five game road trips will not make or break this season. What you need to look for is growth and a team that is working towards an identity.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - As the U.S. presidential candidates sprint toward the finish line, the Bush administration is also sprinting to enact environmental policy changes before leaving power.
Whether it's getting wolves off the Endangered Species List, allowing power plants to operate near national parks, loosening regulations for factory farm waste or making it easier for mountaintop coal-mining operations, these proposed changes have found little favor with environmental groups.
!ADVERTISEMENT!
The one change most environmentalists want, a mandatory program to cut climate-warming greenhouse gas emissions, is not among these so-called "midnight regulations."
Bureaucratic calendars make it virtually impossible that any U.S. across-the-board action will be taken to curb global warming in this administration, though both Republican John McCain and Democrat Barack Obama have promised to address it if they win Tuesday's U.S. presidential election.
Even some free-market organizations have joined conservation groups to urge a moratorium on last-minute rules proposed by the Interior Department and the Environmental Protection Agency, among others.
"The Bush administration has had eight years in office and has issued more regulations than any administration in history," said Eli Lehrer of the Competitive Enterprise Institute. "At this point, in the current economic climate, it would be especially harmful to push through ill-considered regulations in the final days of the administration."
John Kostyack of the National Wildlife Federation, which joined Lehrer's group to call for a ban on these last-minute rules, said citizens are cut out of the process, allowing changes in U.S. law that the public opposes, such as rolling back protections under the Endangered Species Act.
WHAT'S THE RUSH?
The Bush team has urged that these regulations be issued no later than Saturday, so they can be put in effect by the time President George W. Bush leaves office on January 20.
If they are in effect then, it will be hard for the next administration to undo them, and in any case, this may not be the top priority for a new president, said Matt Madia of OMB Watch, which monitors the White House Office of Management and Budget, through which these proposed regulations must pass.
"This is typical," Madia said of the administration's welter of eleventh-hour rules. "It's a natural reaction to knowing that you're almost out of power."
Industry is likely to benefit if Bush's rules on the environment become effective, Madia said.
"Whether it's the electricity industry or the mining industry or the agriculture industry, this is going to remove government restrictions on their activity and in turn they're going to be allowed to pollute more and that ends up harming the public," Madia said in a telephone interview.
What is unusual is the speedy trip some of these environmental measures are taking through the process.
For example, one Interior Department rule that would erode protections for endangered species in favor of mining interests drew more than 300,000 comments from the public, which officials said they planned to review in a week, a pace that Madia called "pretty ludicrous."
Why the rush? Because rules only go into effect 30 to 60 days after they are finalized, and if they are not in effect when the next president takes office, that chief executive can decline to put them into practice -- as Bush did with many rules finalized at the end of the Clinton administration.
White House spokesman Tony Fratto denied the Bush team was cramming these regulations through in a hasty push.
Fratto discounted reports "that we're trying to weaken regulations that have a business interest," telling White House reporters last week the goal was to avoid the flood of last-minute rules left over from the Clinton team.
There is at least one Bush administration environmental proposal that conservation groups welcome: a plan to create what would be the world's largest marine wildlife sanctuary in the Pacific Ocean. That could go into effect January 20.

Humans report a wide range of neurobiological rewards following moderate and intense aerobic activity, popularly referred to as the 'runner's high', which may function to encourage habitual aerobic exercise. Endocannabinoids (eCBs) are endogenous neurotransmitters that appear to play a major role in generating these rewards by activating cannabinoid receptors in brain reward regions during and after exercise. Other species also regularly engage in endurance exercise (cursorial mammals), and as humans share many morphological traits with these taxa, it is possible that exercise-induced eCB signaling motivates habitual high-intensity locomotor behaviors in cursorial mammals. If true, then neurobiological rewards may explain variation in habitual locomotor activity and performance across mammals. We measured circulating eCBs in humans, dogs (a cursorial mammal) and ferrets (a non-cursorial mammal) before and after treadmill exercise to test the hypothesis that neurobiological rewards are linked to high-intensity exercise in cursorial mammals. We show that humans and dogs share significantly increased exercise-induced eCB signaling following high-intensity endurance running. eCB signaling does not significantly increase following low-intensity walking in these taxa, and eCB signaling does not significantly increase in the non-cursorial ferrets following exercise at any intensity. This study provides the first evidence that inter-specific variation in neurotransmitter signaling may explain differences in locomotor behavior among mammals. Thus, a neurobiological reward for endurance exercise may explain why humans and other cursorial mammals habitually engage in aerobic exercise despite the higher associated energy costs and injury risks, and why non-cursorial mammals avoid such locomotor behaviors.
Whenever a group of people put tons of high explosives into a fragile metal tube and set that tube on fire, there are bound to be mishaps. No matter how advanced the equipment or how much funding is provided by Congress, a rocket launch is still a controlled explosion. This is what people are saying when they quip, “Space is hard.” Space is hard because until we perfect antigravity or the space elevator, we will be forced to send our people and our stuff into space on columns of smoke and fire.
However, there are choices we can take to minimize risk and maximize benefits. SpaceX and Boeing are developing two new spacecraft for America's astronauts as part of NASA's commercial crew program. Congress is on the verge of underfunding this unique public-private partnership by $300 million, consigning the program to more delays. Even worse, the Falcon 9 explosion on June 28, despite being the first SpaceX failure after 18 successful launches, is being used by some to argue that commercial crew is not an appropriate method for supporting government space operations.
This could not be further from the truth. Here is why:
Commercial crew will provide redundancy. The Falcon 9 explosion illustrates why it is essential for the United States to have multiple launch providers. Maintaining uninterruptible access to orbit is critical to supporting both civilian and national security assets in space. If one launcher fails and is down for a few months, there needs to be another one to fill the void. Commercial crew is doing just that by midwifing the development of two competitive, commercially available space launch providers.
It is the most reliable alternative. Astronauts currently access low Earth orbit and the International Space Station using Russian rockets. The Russian Proton has failed seven times in the past five years and the Soyuz has failed twice in the past two years. More troubling than the crumbling state of their aerospace industry are recent pronouncements from Russian government officials to end that country's involvement in the International Space Station. Without Russian cooperation, America is unable to access the space station. A $100 billion American investment would be stranded, useless, in outer space. While we hope that our Russian colleagues will not take such a drastic step, it shows that they are becoming increasingly skeptical and unreliable partners in the ISS framework. America quickly needs another way to get its astronauts to the space station, and commercial crew is the only alternative currently under development.
It's cost-effective. Commercial crew uses a new type of contracting method that shifts much of the development risk to the private sector. That, and having two firms competing for limited funds, lowers costs. Specifically, the American taxpayer will spend less than $5.6 billion to get two new launch vehicles under the commercial crew program. Compare that with conventional rocket programs like the new Space Launch System and the old space shuttle program. SLS will cost about $18 billion to develop and the space shuttle cost $43 billion (in 2011 dollars) to develop. Commercial crew represents a new way of doing business at NASA, one the taxpayer and Congress should embrace.
It's developing cutting-edge technology. Both Boeing and SpaceX will use late-model American-made rockets for their commercial crew vehicles. SpaceX in particular is very aggressive in developing cutting-edge launcher technology at multiple facilities throughout the United States. In fact, SpaceX hopes to use machinery developed in the commercial crew program to eventually send spacecraft to Mars. Commercial crew is leading to the development of a new rocket industry in the United States and, more importantly, appears to be inspiring young people to pursue careers in aerospace-related fields. Rather than subsidize the Russian ballistic missile industry or waste taxpayer money on pork-barrel space projects, we should embrace commercial crew because it is helping to develop the technology and the workforce needed to ensure American dominance on the high frontier.
Yes, space is hard. No matter what policy we pursue, there are bound to be failures when we launch rockets into space. However, within that reality, we can choose a path that makes the best and highest use of our shared resources.
Commercial crew is still the best hope the United States has for ensuring uninterruptible and reliable access to low Earth orbit. It will save the American taxpayer money and will continue to expand homegrown innovation and technology development.
Commercial crew, despite recent setbacks and a lack of congressional funding, deserves our continued and full-fledged support.

WASHINGTON — U.S. Sen. Cory Gardner is staying mum until the bitter end.
Hours before the U.S. Senate was set to hold a critical vote Tuesday on health care, Gardner aides said the Colorado Republican still hasn't decided whether he would back it — an approach that tracks with Gardner's weeks-long avoidance of a definitive position.
The ambiguity is in line with the vote itself, a procedural motion on a health care bill whose aim was unknown to most Americans — let alone lawmakers — the night before it was scheduled to take place. While the vote isn't for final passage, and only would allow the Senate to proceed to debate on the legislation, the results are critical to GOP efforts to pass health care legislation.
On what exactly was still unknown hours beforehand.
If the procedural vote is successful, Senate Republicans could move forward on a few options, including a straight repeal of the Affordable Care Act, some version of the health care bill that Republicans have debated for weeks or a new plan to undo parts of the ACA, also known as Obamacare.
The uncertain path is the latest step in a Senate bill-writing process that has unfolded with little transparency and without a single hearing in the upper chamber.
U.S. Sen. Michael Bennet, D-Colorado, blasted that approach Tuesday morning.
“Today we are voting to consider a #healthcare bill w/o knowing what it will do or how it will affect CO,” he wrote on Twitter.
Later, in a message to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell he added: “the American people deserve to know what we are voting for.”
Gardner previously has criticized the lack of public hearings, but it's unclear what he has done or said behind closed doors to compel his colleagues to hold them. As chair of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, he is a member of Senate GOP leadership.
While he's said little about his intentions, Colorado liberals and conservatives have said that they expect Gardner to vote in support of Republican efforts to unwind the Affordable Care Act. The first-term senator also is not considered a “swing vote” by national prognosticators.
“While he has called for changes to the process – any vote he takes isn't on process but is on if the measure is good or bad for Colorado,” said Casey Contres, a Gardner spokesman, in a statement.
Leonardo DiCaprio returns Marlon Brando's Oscar amid investigation involving The Wolf of Wall Street producer
Los Angeles: Hollywood star Leonardo DiCaprio has returned Marlon Brando's best actor Oscar statuette to the US government as part of an investigation into the money laundering by a state-owned Malaysian investment fund.
DiCaprio received Brando's Oscar and other artefacts as his 38th birthday gift in 2012 from business associates at Red Granite Pictures, which also funded his film The Wolf of Wall Street.
The 42-year-old actor has voluntarily handed over the Oscar statuette and other expensive gifts amid investigation into a USD 3.5-billion money-laundering scheme.
Authorities from the US Department of Justice suspect that Red Granite co-founder Riza Aziz may have helped his stepfather, Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak, embezzle USD 4.5 billion from a political development scheme, reported Los Angeles Times.
The misappropriated funds were used to form the production company that funded the Martin Scorsese-directed movie, about a corrupt stockbroker.
The laundered money was used to fund a lavish lifestyle, including purchases of artwork and jewellery, the acquisition of luxury real estate and luxury yachts, the payment of gambling expenses, and the hiring of musicians and celebrities to attend parties.
The multi-million-dollar artworks in question include a Picasso painting, a photograph by Diane Arbus and a Jean- Michel Basquiat collage, which were supposedly gifted to DiCaprio by Jho Low, Red Granite's purported financier.
The actor had accepted the art with the intention of auctioning off the pieces to raise money for his charitable foundation, according to his spokesperson said.
DiCaprio has already given the art and the Oscar to US authorities, the spokesperson added.
And though there are no plans at this time for DiCaprio to forfeit the money he received for his work on The Wolf of Wall Street, his spokesperson noted that the actor intends to offer the return of any "gifts or donations" under speculation with "the aid and instruction of the government".

Having your town be a high-tech center has its advantages. One of them showed this week when a sensor company found oil in Huntsville's iconic Big Spring Park lagoon downtown.
Polaris Sensor Technologies engineer Katie McCann was strolling in the park Wednesday when she smelled and saw oil, company managers said. McCann reported the oil to the city but, unlike most people, she had a tool at her nearby office to get more data.
Located at 200 West Side Square downtown, Polaris makes sensors for military, scientific and commercial uses. One of those sensors can image oil in water using reflected thermal light. The sensor showed the spread of the oil in the lagoon. (See the Polaris video below).
The city sent a crew and notified Huntsville Fire and Rescue and the Haz Mat Team. Both responded, and oil absorbent booms were placed on the east side of the Monroe Street bridge. Vacuuming trucks were also dispatched Thursday and Friday. Meantime, Polaris sent its video to the city so it could see the size of the spill
"We have yet to determine the source of the discharge," the city told AL.com Friday. "This is an event that could have happened some time ago and the rain we received Tuesday (the first real rain we have received in quite a while) flushed it from the storm sewer. The volume of material is decreasing indicating that this is not an ongoing event."
The effect of the oil on the lagoon's ducks and fish isn't clear yet. But here's hoping they dodged it.
Alex Jones Comes to Seattle, Rants on Street Corner, Gets Doused with Coffee by "Vicious Leftists"
Alex, hello, welcome to Seattle. infowars
Attention-thirsty conspiracy theorist Alex Jones is in Seattle for some reason*. For the second day in a row, he has been standing on street corners downtown ranting about the global elite's effort to crash the economy, the CIA's plans to kill Donald Trump, and how everyone he sees has been brainwashed by HBO comedian John Oliver.
During this morning's session (a few seconds after Jones decided Seattleites who told him to fuck off are "the biggest cucks on the planet") a passerby confronted Jones, unscrewed the lid from his to-go mug, and threw coffee in the conspiracy theorist's face. The action starts around 3:40:
Vicious Leftists Attack Alex Jones with scalding coffee in Tolerant Seattle! See the video.. https://t.co/9Hm0c7hh2c
— Alex Jones (@RealAlexJones) August 18, 2017
Jones' conclusion? "This is why they're allied with jihadis because they hate the West so much... These people are bots. They're in a cult. They don't know what's going on."
Jones has argued 9/11 was an inside job, the Boston Marathon bombing was staged, the school shooting in Sandy Hook involved actors, and, now, that the protests in Charlottesville involved "Jewish actors." He also runs a vibrant side business selling diet supplements and has the ear of the president of the United States.
A few seconds after the coffee encounter, former Seattle City Council candidate Michael Maddux encounters Jones, who asks him to talk. Maddux responded, "I don't talk to racist fucks."
"There you go," Jones concluded, "See. They cannot even talk. It's a cult bot."
Jones now appears to be safely back in his hotel room.
Prime Minister Stephen Harper is already distancing himself from a special commission that has called for fundamental changes to Canada's relationship with its indigenous people.
Harper's position of studied indifference calls into question whether the report of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) will have a brutally short shelf-life. That could be the case if the Conservatives are re-elected to govern on Oct. 19.
On the other hand, with both the New Democrats and Liberals saying they support the TRC's sweeping proposals, the commission's blueprint could become federal government policy in coming years if Harper is turfed from office.
It wasn't always this way.
On June 11, 2008, Harper rose in the House of Commons to personally deliver a seemingly emotional and sincere apology on behalf of Canada for its role in the establishment of residential schools.
He told MPs the “cornerstone” of a legal settlement between former residential school students and the federal government and churches was the newly created TRC.
“It will be a positive step in forging a new relationship between aboriginal peoples and other Canadians, a relationship based on the knowledge of our shared history, a respect for each other and a desire to move forward with a renewed understanding that strong families, strong communities and vibrant cultures and traditions will contribute to a stronger Canada for all of us,” said Harper.
But seven years later, Harper's relations with the country's First Nations chiefs – and grassroots movements such as Idle No More – are downright hostile.
No longer is he delivering heartfelt speeches on the issue in the Commons, and certainly not to gatherings of former residential school students, commonly known as “survivors.”
This week, when the TRC released a summary of its final report to hundreds of those survivors at a downtown Ottawa hotel, Harper was just a few blocks away in the nation's capital but chose not to attend.
Instead, he sent Aboriginal Affairs Minister Bernard Valcourt (who sat uncomfortably next to NDP leader Tom Mulcair in the front row in the hall) to formally respond to the TRC's report.
On Wednesday, the prime minister did attend the commission's ceremonial closing at Rideau Hall, an emotion-packed event that left many of the school survivors and others present wiping away tears.
But Harper spoke no words. Rather, he issued a non-committal news release that thanked the TRC for its “hard work” and paid tribute to the “tremendous courage” of former residential school students.
Neither Harper nor Valcourt has held news conferences to answer questions.
Instead, at Rideau Hall, Harper gave the floor to the TRC's three commissioners, and to Gov. Gen David Johnston — all of whom delivered gracious speeches about the need for Canada to make substantive improvements to the lives of aboriginals in the wake of the residential schools.
“As we've heard this week, our actions must be consistent with our words,” Johnston told guests in the ornate ballroom.
“We must demonstrate our commitment to respect, tolerance and inclusiveness as a country.”
At the start of the ceremony, aboriginal elder Evelyn Commanda-Dewache delivered a plaintive prayer, directly urging Harper to join in reconciliation.
“I cried all week,” she said. “Pray for me to be at one with you, Mr. Harper.”
But Harper does not appear interested in spending any of his political capital on supporting the TRC's cause.
In the House of Commons this week, he said his government has already taken “multiple actions” for aboriginals and has spent or committed “vast amounts of money” for their health care and education.
Moreover, with a fall campaign pending, Harper appears to be playing for time. He says his government won't respond to the TRC's 94 recommendations until sometime after the commission releases its full six-volume, two-million-word full report later this year.
In the meantime, it's evident the governing Tories will reject many of the commission's recommendations. They include:
– An inquiry into missing and murdered indigenous women. Harper has rejected the suggestion the problem is a “sociological phenomenon” and says it should be left to police.
– Full adoption of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. Harper's government views it merely as an “aspirational” document. The commissioners met privately with Harper and Sinclair said after that they remain concerned about Harper's “resistance” to the UN declaration.
– New federal legislation to improve national First Nations education, drafted with the “full participation and informed consent” of aboriginals. The government introduced such a bill last year, then dropped it when it was opposed by the Assembly of First Nations. The Tories have suggested they will instead do side-deals with individual communities.

The Democrats think they can count on the votes of women and men who support the right to choose--so they take no action to meet their demands.
"MITT ROMNEY would definitely drag us back."
The Obama campaign's ads to mobilize women voters were out last week in swing states for the 2012 election, and the message was hardly a new one. The Democrats, the argument goes, are the only thing standing in the way of Republicans decimating women's reproductive rights--so you better vote for Obama.
The problem with that reasoning, of course, is that the decimation of the right to choose has been ongoing--including during the last four years when Barack Obama occupied the White House, and the last six years when Democrats had majorities in Congress for much of the time. But the party that claims to be for women's rights didn't do anything to advance those rights and make up for lost ground when they had the chance.
At best, the Democrats opposed the most extreme anti-abortion measures the right came up with. At worst, they gave up more ideological ground to the right--and actually promoted less extreme restrictions--but restrictions nonetheless--on the right to choose as the "realistic" option.
The Democrats don't feel obliged to say what they will do for women, because the Republicans have already talked so much about what they will do against them--and that's all mainstream women's rights organizations seem to care about. When it comes to reproductive rights, there's no "politics of hope"--it's more like the fear factor.
It's time for supporters of women's rights to say enough. Enough empty rhetoric, enough broken promises, enough fear-mongering, enough of Democratic politicians and the liberal women's fundraising organizations that support them compromising away our right to choose.
The Democrats aren't stopping women's rights from being taken away. In fact, they've played a role in making those attacks possible--with their eager compromises with the right that have shifted the entire debate about abortion further and further to the right. By using reproductive rights as a bargaining chip--and a political sound bite to raise only when election-time comes around--they've demonstrated how little they care about these issues as a fundamental part of their platform.
AT A Denver campaign stop last week, Obama was introduced by Sandra Fluke, the woman who tried to testify in Congress about why she needed health insurance that covered birth control--something required by the Obama health care law. Fluke was turned away, and instead made her moving speech via YouTube. She was promptly attacked by Rush Limbaugh, who called her a "slut." According to Limbaugh, Fluke wanted birth control covered so she could have lots of sex like a "prostitute."
For people who know how important it is for women to be able to obtain birth control--something that 99 percent of women who are sexually active with men use at some point in their lifetimes--the sexist attack on Fluke was a lightning rod, inspiring protests against Republicans who want to return to the bad old days of the 1950s.
But for the Obama administration, the decision to highlight Fluke's case and the issue of birth control was a political calculation--one that's limited to a campaign photo op.
Almost as soon as Obama said he supported requiring insurers to cover birth control for women, he also said he was willing to consider an exemption for all institutions associated with the Catholic Church, including universities, hospitals and charities.
In other words, discriminating against women by denying them health coverage mandated by law is okay if you're a Catholic business.
Obama eventually came up with a compromise on the issue, but it didn't satisfy the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, which is filing a lawsuit against the policy, coordinated with dozens of other religious organizations--which are perhaps emboldened by how quickly they got Obama to consider an exemption.
Besides, the fact that the Obama administration says it supports birth control shouldn't really be a huge deal. The "debate" about the importance of birth control ended decades ago. The result: Women need it, period. This once-settled issue is only back because of the utterly backward character of the right's assault on women's reproductive rights.
Ultimately, this is advantageous for Democrats. They can pose as protectors of women's rights by sticking up for something as non-controversial with most people as birth control--while ignoring more difficult battles, like federal funding to cover abortions, that ought to be fought to make reproductive health care accessible to all women.
On the contrary, the Democrats ran away from that debate. During negotiations with conservative Democrats about the Affordable Care Act in 2010, Obama promised to issue an executive order applying the restrictions of the Hyde Amendment--which bars federal funding to poor women seeking abortions--to the health care law.
In other words, Obama, who said when he was running for president that he would work to overturn the Hyde Amendment, used abortion funding for poor women as a bargaining chip to get his bill past anti-abortion Democrats.
At the time, the Democratic Party wasn't just in charge of the White House but the majority in both houses of Congress. You'd think it would be a good time to take some steps to guarantee access to abortion for all women. But the Democrats demanded less--and got it.
THIS SELLOUT on abortion in the health care law is in keeping with the Democrats approach to women's dwindling abortion rights generally--a lot of talk, at least around election-time, and no action.
In state after state, access to abortion is under assault. In just the first half of 2012, state governments have enacted 95 new provisions related to reproductive health and rights. According to the Guttmacher Institute, the following measures passed in this six-month period:
There are 39 new restrictions on access to abortion.
Three states have limited access to medication abortion, bringing to eight the number of states restricting access to the treatment.
Three states enacted unconstitutional measures that ban abortion prior to fetal viability, either at 18 or 20 weeks post-fertilization (the equivalent of 20 or 22 weeks after the woman's last menstrual period)--bringing the number of states that have barred abortion at this early point in pregnancy to nine.
Two states adopted measures requiring that a woman listen to the fetal heartbeat before she can obtain an abortion. Louisiana's heartbeat requirement necessitates performing a transvaginal ultrasound for abortions performed in the first eight weeks.
Two states adopted measures requiting that women get counseling on the negative mental health effects of abortion, even though there is no medical basis for this claim. This makes nine states that require such counseling.
Several states implemented waiting periods before women could get an abortion, bringing the total number with this restriction to 26. In April, Utah became the first state to impose a 72-hour waiting period on women before they can terminate a pregnancy.
Four states limited coverage of abortion in the health exchanges that will be established as part of the Affordable Care Act, bringing the number of states doing so to 20.
According to Guttmacher, 55 percent of U.S. women of reproductive age now live in one of the 26 states considered hostile to abortion rights.
Democratic politicians may voice concern about the worst offenses of the right wing, but they've looked the other way as states pass restriction after restriction on the right to choose. Instead, the approach of "finding common ground" with abortion opponents has meant that women's reproductive rights are being compromised away.
Men and women who support a woman's right to abortion--and fundamentally, her right to make her own decisions about her body--shouldn't be forced to compromise about what they want just because there's an election campaign taking place. These are choices that deeply affect the lives of women and their ability to be equal human beings in society. They must be considered with the seriousness they deserve.
Anti-abortion Republican politicians are attempting to take away all women's right to decide with bills about "fetal pain," "personhood," mandatory ultrasound and counseling. According to them, women need to be told what to do because they can't possibly make decisions for themselves.
Why would Democratic Party politicians ever want to find "common ground" with these people?
The Democrats would rather woo voters who support restrictions on abortion than make the effort to meet the demands of pro-choice women. Why? Because they know these women will vote for them anyway, because they haven't been given any other alternative.
In boardrooms of liberal women's groups like the National Organization for Women and NARAL Pro-Choice America, they're already vowing to pull out all the stops to re-elect Barack Obama, no matter what--and expecting absolutely nothing in return. Fear of what a Romney White House might look like might be enough for these groups, but it shouldn't be for those of us who think women deserve better.
Mitt Romney, Paul Ryan and the other Republican opponents of women's right to choose are indeed scary, and they have women's reproductive rights in their sights. But the Democrats clearly aren't up to the job of stopping them. That will depend on what we do.
Mark Ricciuto of the Crows marks despite the efforts of Josh Hunt of the Cats during the round 13 AFL match between Adelaide and Geelong at AAMI Stadium July 2, 2006 in Adelaide, Australia.
Crows champion Mark Ricciuto has joined the Board of the Adelaide Football Club.
Ricciuto's return is part of a long held succession plan, which will also see two highly valued and long-serving Board members, Peter Hurley and John Sutton, retire at the end of the year.
One of the Club's greatest-ever players, Ricciuto played 312 games for the Crows in a decorated career spanning 15 years. A premiership player, Brownlow Medallist, eight-time All Australian and triple best-and-fairest winner, Ricciuto captained Adelaide in 142 matches between 1999-2007 and remains the Club's longest-serving skipper. He retired at the end of the 2007 season and was inducted into the Australian Football Hall of Fame in 2011.
Adelaide currently has seven board members, while the Chief Executive sits as a Board appointed Director. Under the Crows' new Constitution, which allows for between seven and nine Directors, there is scope to now add another Director.
Ricciuto steps into this role immediately until the end of the year. Ricciuto will then stand for election, with the Club's members now having the capacity to fill up to two positions on the board.
Ricciuto said he was excited about returning in an official capacity to the Club, where he achieved the ultimate personal and team success as a player.
“From the moment I retired, I wanted to stay involved with the Club,” he said.
“I have now been able to re-shape my business commitments, allowing sufficient time to give this role the energy and effort it deserves.”
Chairman Rob Chapman paid tribute to Mr Hurley and Mr Sutton, who have helped guide the Club for the past 14 seasons and are both life members.
“They have made an enormous contribution, having overseen the building of our world class training facility and historic move to a redeveloped Adelaide Oval,” Chapman said.
“Both of them have helped put the Club in the strong position it holds today.”
Mr Hurley said it was a well-planned transition.
“I first raised succession with the Chairman when I was last re-appointed to a three year term, and flagged that Mark Ricciuto would make an ideal Board member to take my place,” he said.
“I am delighted that such an outstanding person is coming onto the Board.
“I leave at the end of the year incredibly proud of everything we have achieved as a Club and having enjoyed every minute of my time here.”
Mr Sutton described his time on the Board as a privilege.
“There has been so much happen and so much progress made over the past 14 years,” he said.
“I know the Club is in great shape and a bright future awaits, but it is time for me to hand over at the end of the year.
“The Club is a collection of wonderful people and many are now lifelong friends, who will always hold a special place in my heart.”
An explosive-laden car was rammed into a hotel in the town of Kohat, which lies in North West Frontier Province, on the edge of Pakistan's Taliban-controlled tribal area.
The hotel was owned by a Shia businessman and the surrounding neighbourhood was also dominated by the minority Muslim sect. While the police and the army are usually the target for suicide blasts, the violence in Pakistan is increasingly also sectarian. Responsibility for the attack was claimed by a little known outfit called Lashkar Al-Almi, which is likely to be a Taliban splinter group.
"Twenty-five to 30 people have been killed in the blast. Twenty bodies are lying beside me," said Mehtab-ul-Hasan, a local official.
Around 70 people were injured by the bomb, which flattened the marketplace surrounding the hotel. Heavy machinery was called in to remove debris, so that trapped people and bodies could be reached.
Kohat, the nearby city of Hangu, and the Orakzai and Kurram parts of the tribal area to the west, have significant Shiite populations, which have been terrorised by the Taliban – who are from Pakistan's majority Sunni Muslim faith. The new leader of Pakistan's Taliban, Hakimullah Mehsud, who became chief after Baitullah Mehsud was killed last month, came up through a violent sectarian organization Sipah-e-Sahaba. Hakimullah is based in Orakzai.

For fans expecting hard edged espionage, a Tinker Tailor Soldier Spielberg, adjust expectations accordingly. Light in tone and laced with comedy—a machination of the Coen Brothers' contributions to Matt Charman's screenplay, no doubt—Bridge of Spies shares the same broad entertainment as last year's spy movie The Imitation Game. Instead of Alan Turing and code deciphering spy games, Bridge of Spies credibly recreates the cold war tensions of the 1950s. Two spies, the downed spy plane pilot Gary Powers (Austin Stowell) and Russian agent Rudolf Abel (Mark Rylance), an undercover on American soil, are set to be swapped. With relationships between the United States, Russia, and East Berlin coming to an intense boil, the stakes are high: if this deal goes badly, it could mean nuclear war.
To facilitate the delicate trade in East Berlin is aw shucks and the American Way Tom Hanks, playing the smart and swift insurance lawyer James Donovan—a character so folksy, innately patriotic, and kind spirited that in the same way Ethan Hunt is indistinguishable from Tom Cruise, Tom Hanks is perceptually inseparable from James Donovan. Only Tom Hanks can command the needed level of believable optimism for Donovan without missing a beat, and his shoulders, proverbially made of red, white, and blue, muscle through this disjointed, uneven, but nonetheless engaging movie.
Sadly Spies isn't just similar to The Imitation Game in their shared interest in pleasing an audience—a goal they're pretty good at—but in the exact way that they go about it. To the frustration of historical purists, each movie reduces a morally complex, tragic story into what ultimately boils into feel-good fun. This is all the more inexplicable in how, in the case of Spies at least, the rest of the movie's style vividly clashes with the serious subject matter (an incoherence especially obvious next to Janusz Kaminski's grim, monochrome cinematography) as well as next to the darkest moments of the script—including a massacre of a family (politely) filmed from afar. Life around the Berlin Wall was prolifically brutal. This is a dark story in which Spielberg has turned the lights on, an error that no amount of snappy direction can forgive. For the world's most famous and loved director, one persistent flaw is how so many of his movies struggled to finish on the appropriate note, like the contrived uplift endings of Minority Report or War of the Worlds. Bridge of Spies extends this widely-written-about flaw to the entire movie.
BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Darwinian principles should apply in the euro zone and the rule of survival of the fittest prevail, with the strongest economies having the leading say in how the bloc is run, Finland's Europe Minister Alex Stubb said on Thursday.
Setting out his argument for the euro zone's six triple-A rated countries to have more influence in the region's economic management, Stubb said the 13-year-old currency needed to look to its strongest members to secure the future.
“We've been looking at the whole debate from the wrong end, we've been looking at countries that we need to save and help all the time,” he told Reuters in an interview.
“For me, the euro is a Darwinist system, it is the survival of the fittest. The markets take care of that, and I think that's the best way we can keep up market pressure,” said Stubb, who is himself a fitness fanatic and frequently completing Ironman triathlons.
Finland's former foreign minister, who wrote his doctoral thesis on differentiated integration in the euro zone, said the triple-A stamp granted by credit rating agencies to those countries with the best public finances was the benchmark all countries in the euro zone should be aiming for.
Only a combination of intense market pressure and internal political pressure could ensure that the 11 non triple-A countries using the euro met their obligations by trimming their budget deficits and reducing their debts.
“It should be the triple-A countries that basically, not dictate the rules, but at least have a strong say, because why would we listen to countries that are not taking care of their own public finances?” he asked.
“I'm not saying that the markets are flawless, but I'm saying that we need a combination of market rules and political rules. Let the markets put the peer pressure on countries that are not triple-A rated.
“It should be in the vested interests of each and every EU member state, whether in the euro or outside the euro, to be a triple-A country.”
WHAT'S MY RATING?
Of the 17 euro zone countries, only Germany, France, Austria, the Netherlands, Luxembourg and Finland have a top rating from all three major rating agencies.
France's rating is, however, under pressure, with concerns that it could be downgraded by at least one of the agencies in the coming months if its finances do not improve.
Having the highest rating generally means countries are able to raise funds on international markets more cheaply, having to offer lower interest rates to raise capital.
Stubb said he was not advocating any country having to leave the euro zone if it could not achieve a triple-A rating, but said he wanted to see a reappraisal of what it takes to keep the currency union strong.
“The aim is to try to prevent this situation from ever happening again,” he said. “You need both carrots and sticks, and I think the carrots need to be market driven.
“You can always talk about the political core of Europe, but to be quite honest it's a lot of hot air. The real core is usually formed by those countries who in this particular case are triple-A rated and are in the euro, so it's a market driven core.”
As part of a push for deeper integration among euro zone member states, some EU officials have mentioned the possibility of the triple-A rated countries pooling their risk and jointly issuing debt as euro zone bonds.
The European Commission is due to present proposals later this month on euro zone bonds, including how feasible it would be to issue such debt given the wide economic disparities that exist among the 17 member states.
Stubb said he wasn't advocating that only the triple-A countries should be able to issue euro area bonds, but did not dismiss it. Because the triple-A countries can raise funds relatively cheaply in financial markets, it is unclear why they would want or have to issue jointly underwritten debt.
The main aim, Stubb said, was to make it clear that there is a core group within the euro zone that has a better economic management reputation that the rest, and that everyone should aspire to belong to the better group.
“The whole idea of a core, or an economic core or triple-A core is centrifugal. It's a like a magnet, it pulls you along,” he said.
Referring to his thesis, which examined a paper put forward by two German finance officials in 1994, Stubb hinted that the euro zone might have been much smaller if those ideas had been pursued.
“You know the euro in the beginning, in the Schaeuble-Lamers paper when they proposed a core of the euro, it was five countries in the beginning. They left Italy out.”

Xcel Energy yesterday announced plans to build and own a new 300 MW wind farm in South Dakota that the utility says illustrates the economic viability of wind power even as federal tax credits are phased out.
According to Xcel, the Dakota Range I and II project is the first publicly announced wind project to advance under the phase down of federal tax credits.
To be developed by Apex Clean Energy, Xcel also said the proposal puts it on pace to be the first utility in the United States to exceed 10,000 MW of wind on its system.
Dive Insight:
Wind projects that begin construction this year will get 80% of the federal production tax credit, with the incentive declining until it is phased out in 2020. But Xcel says its project is viable even without the full credit, and highlights how wind energy is becoming more competitive.
“This is a milestone for our industry and our customers,” said Xcel Chairman and CEO Ben Fowke. “Wind provides the clean, competitively priced energy our customers want. This project proves we can keep driving the clean energy transition of our supply mix while keeping customer bills low, even as incentives phase out.”
In addition, the project will provide new local jobs and long-term revenue for Grant and Codington counties, S.D., the company said.
The Dakota Range project will use Vestas turbines and is expected to be operational in 2021. This increases Xcel Energy's current wind proposals nationwide to 3,680 MW at 13 wind farms in seven states, the utility said.
Congress struck a deal in 2015 to extend the wind production tax credit through 2020, with a gradual decline beginning this year. The U.S. Internal Revenue Service in April increased the credit for wind power sold this year, to $0.024/kWh, up slightly from $0.023/kWh, to account for inflation.
At his weekly press conference today, Coach Johnson revealed that redshirt junior and starting wide receiver Micheal Summers has left the team. This news comes out after Summers had 4 catches for 58 yards at Virginia, and as the Jackets prepare for a stretch run where they'll need to win three straight games in order to attain bowl eligibility.
The news is troubling, as Summers is a veteran leader on offense who is second on the team in receptions and third on the team in yards and touchdowns. It's unclear why he chose to depart the team when he did, although sources close to the program have speculated some potential frustration with the relatively limited nature of his role. Summers will finish his career at Georgia Tech with 29 receptions for 434 yards and two touchdowns.
For the rest of this season, expect to see true freshman Brad Stewart replacing Summers in a starting capacity at wide receiver. Stewart has already played significantly off the bench this season, including a pair of starts against Duke and North Carolina when Summers was unable to go due to injury. Aside from him, you'll see more of redshirt freshman Jalen Johnson, redshirt sophomore Antonio Messick, and potentially redshirt senior walk-on Brandon Oliver. At this point in the season, don't expect a redshirt to be burned for true freshmen
Thank you for your contribution. Your support is critical to helping me to get things done. I've turned the page from campaigning to doing what the voters of Minnesota elected me to do -- fight for the best interests of the people in our state and across America. After spending two years talking about what I planned to do if elected, it's an incredible feeling to be here and start getting things done. My first piece of legislation was the Service Dogs for Veterans Act -- which established a program withing the U.S. Department of Veteran Affiars that pairs disabled veterans with service dogs...
In these days where bipartisanship has become a concept imbued with cynicism and mockery, this was, amazingly enough, truly a bipartisan bill. Co-sponsors included Sen. Johnny Isakson (R-G.A.), Sen. Lindsay Graham (R-S.C.), Sen. Mary Landrieu (D-L.A.), Sen. Mark Begich (D-A.K.), and Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-O.H.).
How like Al to craft legislation that is both compassionate and smart. Here's how he described it:
"There's a huge return on investment here. Service dogs can do amazing things, and there is evidence to suggest that increasing their numbers would reduce the alarming suicide rate among veterans, decrease the number of hospitalizations, and lower the cost of medications and human care.
"I believe it is enough simply to improve the lives of those of whom we asked so much. But this program isn't just the right thing to do. It's the smart thing to do. This small investment will pay dividends for these veterans for years to come."
I also offered an amendment to the 2010 Defense Appropriations Bill that would stop funding defense contractors who deny victims of sexual assault their day in court.
Yes, he did. An amendment that was, not incidentally, opposed by the Defense Department. If you missed Franken's masterful performance in dismantling the KBR attorney who was attempting to defend mandatory, binding arbitration for rape cases, it was a thing of beauty. But first, he displayed exemplary respect and admiration for Jamie Leigh Jones, the courageous young woman who was brutally gang-raped by KBR employees in Iraq. Watch:
I've learned that a senator has the incredible privilege of doing things that make a real difference to real people. That's a privilege I will continue to cherish.
And it's a privilege that he wasted no time in putting into practice. Senator Al is capable of working magic with people, by the simple act of patient listening, by saying in response to challenges, "That's a great question", and then giving replies that are respectful, considerate, detailed and exactly on topic. He does this even with angry people, people who have been incited to believe that people like Al Franken are socialists and health care reform is an evil plot. Every politician should be required to watch this, and learn:
Thank you for your continuing support. Sincerely,
Al Franken
Thank you, Al, for setting such a wonderful example, even as a freshman senator. There is little doubt that you will prove to be a worthy successor to Paul Wellstone. Happy Holidays to you and Franni.
The Mount Saint Vincent University Faculty Association has voted in favour of a strike mandate, according to a statement from the association released Friday.
The association's 145 members — which include faculty, librarians, and lab instructors — have been without a contract since June 30. According to the statement, negotiations for a new collective agreement are "at an impasse."
Of the 93 per cent of members who cast a ballot, 88 per cent voted in favour of a strike mandate. The association says it has filed for conciliation with the Nova Scotia Department of Labour, which is scheduled for Oct. 2.
A strike mandate "doesn't mean we're walking out on strike anytime soon," said Linda Mann, the association's president.
'Sends a message'
"In fact, it may actually mean that we are far less likely to go on strike because our membership really supports the mandate we have, that we had for bargaining and going into conciliation. So that sends a message to our employer, 'Gee, let's just get this settled.'"
Mann says there's growing concern within the association about recruitment and retention of faculty. She says other universities in the province have salary settlements in the range of 5.5 per cent for a three-year agreement.
Without comparable increases, she says, the school's alternative is to rely more heavily on part-time faculty, which will cause "a real erosion of quality of teaching."
"We're not actually looking for the exact same salaries, like Saint Mary's or Dalhousie or Acadia, because we're paid on salary scales. But what we're looking for is we get a salary increase that is comparable to them."
Collective agreement bargaining happens every three years, Mann said. Of the last five rounds, four have had to go to conciliation and a strike vote.
University response
According to a statement released by the school, bargaining teams met 13 times over the summer.
"While a number of items were advanced and dates for additional meetings were established, the Faculty Association opted in late August to proceed via conciliation. With conciliation talks set to begin in early October, we remain optimistic that an agreement can be reached."
The school says a strike won't happen until a number of steps have been followed through.
"In our past three rounds of bargaining with the MSVU FA, we have attained a successful outcome with the support of a conciliator."
Introducing her father on Thursday night at the Republican National Convention, Ivanka Trump proved herself her father's most effective surrogate, all but stealing the show in a convention that until that moment was marked by low energy, marred by plagiarism and rife with division.
“When my father says that he will make America great again, he will deliver. We have a chance this year to reclaim our heritage as a country to dream big and making the impossible happen,” she said. “Fortunately, Donald Trump is incapable of thinking small. When I was a little girl, he'd say to me: ‘Ivanka, you're going to be thinking any way, may as well think big.'”
Ivanka's speech drew some of the biggest applause of the convention, uniting and exciting a party that has spent much of the week divided. She emphasized her father's empowerment of women and minorities, areas where he has proved weak in polls. And she shared personal and humanizing anecdotes about a man that has largely gone unknown on a personal level at his own convention.
It is striking that Trump was introduced not by a politician, or a business titan, not a religious leader or his wife, but by the person he is potentially closest to in the world. When asked who his closest advisers are, Trump always puts Ivanka's name at the top of his list. Ivanka herself told the New York Times that when they are apart they speak on the phone five times or more a day.

In many ways, Ivanka is the yin to Trump's yang, the id to his ego: she's cool and calm while he's hot and bothered. She is relentlessly on message and overprepared while her father wings it and sometimes says unfortunate things. Growing up in the spotlight, she is standoffish toward media attention, while her father seeks it and thrives on it. A 2015 Vogue profile noted that Ivanka has no pictures of herself in her office, even though the former model has graced plenty of magazine covers, while her father's office upstairs in Trump Tower is filled with smiling pictures of his face beaming from multiple magazine covers.
Emerging on stage to the Beatles' “Here Comes the Sun,” Ivanka, 34, spoke nostalgically Thursday night of growing up constructing Lego buildings on the floor of her father's office while he “built the same things with glass and steel.” In a biographical video earlier in the evening, she reminisced: “When I was young he'd send me postcards of buildings and say, ‘I can't wait for you to grow up and help me build these.' Now it's fun to stand shoulder to shoulder with my father.”
While her father grew up in Queens, gazing across the water at the glitz of Manhattan, Ivanka grew up in the bosom of that glitz. She attended some of the nation's most elite schools: Chapin in New York City; Choate Rosemary Hall, where John F. Kennedy went to high school; Georgetown University; and her father's Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania. In addition to being an executive vice president of the Trump Organization and her father's right-hand woman in his real estate business, she also was his understudy on The Apprentice, has launched her own fine jewelry, shoes and clothing brands as well as an online magazine called Ivanka Trump that, like her 2009 best-selling book, The Trump Card: Playing to Win in Work and Life, speaks to professional millennial women like herself.
As her father told Vogue: “She was a very successful model, and she just gave it up and went to Wharton,” he said. “She said, ‘I love real estate.' In the end, she chose the family business. Ivanka is a natural dealmaker. She'll take this company to great levels.”
In 2009, she married Jared Kushner, the son of another billionaire real estate tycoon. Kushner, a Democrat, has become one of Trump's closest political advisers. Ivanka — who has given money to Hillary Clinton and Mitt Romney and held a fundraiser for New Jersey Senator Cory Booker, who is on Clinton's VP shortlist — told the Republican crowd that she has always supported the candidate she felt best represented her.
“I do not consider myself a Republican or a Democrat,” she said. “Not this time. Donald Trump is the person to make America great again.”
Ivanka wasn't always so supportive of her father's candidacy. Early on, she told CNN: “As a citizen, I love what he's doing. As a daughter, it's obviously more complicated. She has often been the person he's turned to when in distress, like when he and Fox's Megyn Kelly were at odds. But she and her siblings have grown to become some of their father's most effective surrogates. Ivanka and brother Donald Jr. at a Skybox on Tuesday night wooed Sheldon Adelson, the billionaire Republican megadonor, whose money could make or break the general election as Trump plays catch-up to Clinton on the fundraising front.
And she has suffered a fair amount of sibling jealousy. Her older brother Donald Jr. once described her as “Daddy's little girl,” according to the New York Times. And earlier Thursday, her little brother Eric Trump told CNN's Sara Murray: “She does the princess thing very well and she's obviously very close with my father.” Both her brothers spoke on earlier convention nights, and neither shared the same kind of personal anecdotes that Ivanka did.
Ivanka, who has said in the past that she supports equal pay, used her speech to make a powerful case for women's equality — an unusually feminist argument for a Republican convention. In lines that could have been spoken by Hillary Clinton, she pledged to make it her mission to help women in America.
“As President, my father will change the labor laws put in place when women were not a significant portion of the workforce. He will make childcare affordable and accessible to all,” she said. “He will fight for equal pay for equal work and I will fight for this too right alongside of him.”
“In Donald Trump, you have a candidate that knows the difference between wanting something to happen and making it happen,” she reiterated. With a smile to the audience, she added: “Judge his values by those he has instilled in his children.”

This 1936 Austin Seven Competition Special (chassis 246539) is believed to have been built in 1959 as a one-off, pre-production prototype for a run of additional cars that never came to be. It appears to be in excellent condition, though is claimed to be unrestored and all-original. Sold with a binder full of documentation, we think it'd make a fun vintage hillclimb machine or small-capacity class circuit racer. Find it here on eBay in Lansdale, Pennsylvania for $25k OBO.
​A former Classic and Sports Car magazine feature, we assume that between its print coverage and seemingly extensive but unspecified documentation there should be ample information on construction methods and history, though only very minimal details of either are provided within the ad. What we do know is that it looks really cool and that we want to drive it.
​This interior shot shows a surprisingly full collection of gauges, though being on the small side we can't quite make out what they all do. Note the interesting gear shift rod arrangement and tiny, neatly arranged trunk with separate compartments for battery, fuel filler access and luggage.
​Power comes from a 750cc Austin four cylinders fitted with a Speedex alloy head, high lift cam and twin SU carbs. Other period hop ups include Bowden independent front suspension, Bowden brakes, and what are believed to be Speedex manifolds as well. Stock output was on the order of 10 HP or so, and we're guessing substantially freer breathing should easily be able to double that number—not entirely bad for a car which probably weighs about half a ton. Mileage is quoted as 20k and change.
​More than a bit out of its element here in the US—or any modern context, really—we'd love a go along some narrow, early morning, thick forested back roads, the kind the Southeast and parts of the Midwest seem to specialize in. Hopefully it will be put to good vintage race use, too.

Voice actress Christine Cavanaugh, who brought to life characters including Babe and Chuckie on Nickelodeon cartoon Rugrats, has died aged 51.
Her sister, Deionn Masock, confirmed the actress had died on 22 December at her home in Utah.
Ms Masock said the cause of death was not known.
"She was able to do incredible and amazing things with her voice and bring lots of smiles and many laughs to many people," her family said.
Announcing in the death in the Los Angeles Times, they wrote: "Her imagination, humour and intelligence were evident to anyone who had the pleasure of meeting her.
"Many know of her from the roles she played, but in each role there was a part of her showing through that the ones who truly knew her could see."
Cavanaugh was a prolific actor, providing the voices of dozens of cartoon characters in the 1990s.
She began her career with small parts on TV shows including Cheers, before landing her first big role in 1991 as Gosalyn Mallard on Darkwing Duck.

The same year she was cast as the cowardly Chuckie Finster in Rugrats - a role she would perform for a decade.
In 1995, she gave her voice to the title character in the hit movie Babe, based on Dick King-Smith's 1983 novel The Sheep-Pig, about a talking pig who wants to be a sheepdog.
Cavanaugh also provided the voice to kid genius Dexter in Cartoon Network's Dexter's Laboratory for seven series from 1996.
She was twice nominated for an Annie Award for the role, before finally winning the prize in 2000.
Over her career, the actress also provided voices for animations including Aaahh!!! Real Monsters, Sonic the Hedgehog, The Wild Thornberrys and The Powerpuff Girls.
She retired from voice acting in 2001 and moved back to her native Utah to be closer to her family.
According to her obituary, a memorial for Cavanaugh has been held on Antelope Island in Utah.
Fictional War Goddesses I Think Should Make Out With Each Other, In No Particular Order
It seems to me that not nearly enough of our collective time is spent dedicated to imagining which goddesses of war and death ought to have made out with one another. Imagine the luxurious plaited tresses, the simple linen tunics, the highly-developed back muscles from wielding all those broadswords. Who couldn't want this?
If I could draw, I would spend up to and including 92% of my time drawing war goddesses from various mythologies making out with each other. I, however, cannot draw – but Nico Deyo can.
Here is what it would look like if Athena, Greek goddess of wisdom and just warfare, made out with a Valkyrie, one of the shieldmaidens of the valiantly slain in Norse mythology:
Here is what it might look like if Artemis, goddess of the hunt, started dating an Amazon. You are either the kind of person who needs to see a drawing of this possible pairing or you are not. If you are not, I cannot help you.
What would happen if Morgan le Fay made out with a female version of Loki? Man, you better believe there would be some fur capes involved.
If you can draw, and you're not currently sketching a hot-and-heavy embrace between the Iceni warrior queen Boudica and female samurai Hangaku Gozen, you don't really deserve to have hands, do you?
“Oh, no thanks, Mallory, I'd prefer not to imagine real-life warrior queens Nzinga and Zenobia sharing their fierce and tender power with one another through the medium of making out.” What is wrong with you.

Carson Palmer was in the middle of one of the best games of his professional career, on a nationally televised primetime stage in a hostile road environment, and lighting up what was supposed to be a defense that'd had his number in recent years.
There he was, a quarterback who at 35 was silencing critics, proving that yes, he can win the big games. The Cardinals were up 22-7 at halftime in Seattle, and dominating on both sides of the ball. The NFC West power shift had never looked so evident.
And then it happened.
Article continues below ...
The kind of plays that fuel the critics' fire and the turnovers that show up on loop as footage that accompanies the talking head TV shows criticizing him on Monday mornings. Two plays. Flukes. A weird fumble off of his own foot that led to one score; a strip-sack fumble return that led to another touchdown.
Fourth quarter. Roof caving in. The Cardinals were suddenly down 29-25 and the Twitter birds were chirping. Loudly.
And what'd Palmer do?
He shut them up and he shut down the Seahawks, leading the Cardinals on long, consecutive touchdown drives, calmly and with precision. The Cardinals retook the lead with a 10-play, 83-yard drive. Palmer completed 6 of 9 pass attempts for 75 yards and tossed a touchdown. On the following Cardinals possession, Palmer led an eight-play, 80-yard touchdown drive that gave Arizona a 10-point lead and put the game (and critics) to sleep.
He's slaying dragons this year, one big moment at a time.
Palmer has, rather quietly, been flat-out great. The 12-year veteran has thrown for more than 300 yards in six games this season and the Cardinals have a commanding three-game lead in the NFC West.
He's also second in the league in passer rating (108) behind only Tom Brady. Palmer, of course, is doing all this in a season in which he's coming off a severe ACL injury at an age when players don't typically recover well.
Each week, Palmer uses advanced virtual reality technology to simulate upcoming opposing defenses and has been the leader in the huddle Arizona was missing when both he and backup Drew Stanton went down late last season.
Of course, fans in Cincinnati might not exactly be pulling for this sweet tale of courage and redemption. The Bengals take on Palmer for just the second time since he left town on Sunday and the feelings are not warm.
Bengals supporters still view Palmer as a “quitter” or “traitor” and they still burn from his 2011 decision to not return to the Bengals, putting the team in a bind despite a contract that paid him handsomely.
Cincinnati, with its hand forced, ultimately traded Palmer, its franchise quarterback for eight years, to Oakland for a 2012 first-round pick and a conditional second-rounder in 2013 that off-season. A decision owner Mike Brown didn't want to make.
After replacing Palmer that season, Andy Dalton's been a more than capable starter in his five years as a Bengal. But like his predecessor, he has demons to exorcise. Despite an 8-1 record this season and four trips to the postseason in his first four seasons, Dalton needs a playoff win. Bad.
Sunday night presents a fascinating game between two of the league's best and most underappreciated quarterbacks, and two different fan bases that have been waiting, waiting and waiting some more for any of its many quarterbacks to get them over the hump.
It's not crazy to think that this is just Part I of the matchup, and that the Bengals and Cardinals — Palmer and his replacement — meet again in February.
THIS WEEK'S PODCAST
Lights Out himself, Shawne Merriman joins Schrager on the podcast. Shawne tells us what makes Philip Rivers so good, how he got his famous nickname and why Tom Brady is a notch above everyone else. Plus, Peter cannot get over the possible scenario of the Broncos telling Peyton that Brock Osweiler could be their guy.
WEEK 11 CHEAT SHEET TRIVIA QUESTION
Kirk Cousins became the first Redskins quarterback with more than 300 passing yards and a passer rating of more than 150 in a game since which legendary Washington signal caller?
Now, on to the picks.
Week 10 Record: 6-8
Overall Record: 78-68
THURSDAY NIGHT
Tennessee Titans at Jacksonville Jaguars: If you thought last week's Thursday night uniforms were a tough look, just wait until you see these two. The Jaguars home uniforms can only be described as mustard and honey. Great. The Titans? Baby blue on baby blue. Sure. As for the game itself, I like the Jaguars in their home building, a place they haven't seen much of. Partly because of their Bills game in London, and partly because of the scheduling gods dealing them an odd hand, the Jaguars have played at EverBank Field just once since Sept. 20.
The Pick: Jaguars 24, Titans 23
The Result: Jaguars 19, Titans 13
Indianapolis Colts at Atlanta Falcons: I'll be at this one on Sunday, and actually like the Matt Hasselbeck-led Colts on the road. That AFC South race got awfully interesting last week with Andrew Luck being ruled out indefinitely and the Texans giving it to the Bengals in Cincinnati. Indy holds serve on Sunday.
The Pick: Colts 30, Falcons 20
St. Louis Rams at Baltimore Ravens: This is familiar territory for Case Keenum. Well, sorta. With their top three quarterbacks hurt last season, the Texans signed Keenum off the Rams' practice squad and started him just six days later against the heavily favored Ravens. Well, guess what? Entering the game 0-8 as a starter, Keenum went out and beat playoff-bound Baltimore, outplaying Joe Flacco in the process. Keenum's been with the Rams all year, and is not being thrust into an unfamiliar situation this time around. Todd Gurley's been contained the past two weeks. He'll get his groove back on Sunday against a struggling Ravens D.
The Pick: Rams 26, Ravens 21
Washington Redskins at Carolina Panthers: How about Kirk Cousins' 2015 season? He gets the call in August to great controversy, has a so-so September, a better October, and is in the midst of an excellent November. Put together a strong final six weeks of the season, and he could suddenly be looking at a megabucks free agent contract this offseason. And why not? In an era when quarterbacks are seemingly impossibly hard to find, Cousins is young, confident and winning both on the field and in the locker room. The Panthers aren't going undefeated this season.
The Pick: Redskins 25, Panthers 20
Oakland Raiders at Detroit Lions: In April 2007, the Raiders selected JaMarcus Russell with the first overall pick in the NFL Draft. The Lions took Calvin Johnson at No. 2. How different would the past 10 years have been for both of these teams had the Raiders gone with Johnson — or, say, No. 7 overall pick Adrian Peterson — instead of the ill-fated Russell? Matthew Stafford almost certainly would not be a Lion, and the history of both teams could be entirely different. Fun hypothetical. The Raiders, meanwhile, were everybody's darlings two weeks ago. Two straight losses and that bandwagon is suddenly empty again. I'll always take an empty bandwagon over a full one.
The Pick: Raiders 34, Lions 20
New York Jets at Houston Texans: The Texans are coming off a short week, a Monday night road game, and have uncertainty at the quarterback position with Brian Hoyer working through the concussion protocol. The Jets have had 10 days off and time to properly prepare and gameplan. Guess what?
The Pick: Texans 20, Jets 17
Dallas Cowboys at Miami Dolphins: Tony Romo's back and whether he's 40, 50 or 100 percent, it's an upgrade from whatever else the Cowboys have been trotting out on the field the past few weeks. Miami head coach Dan Campbell grew up a diehard Cowboys fan and cherished his time in Big D. "I was a huge Cowboys fan," Campbell said this week. "It was when I played for the Giants, when I started, that was always a weird game for me to play the Cowboys." I think he gets the best of his "favorite" team on Sunday.
The Pick: Dolphins 24, Cowboys 16
Green Bay Packers at Minnesota Vikings: I like the Vikings here. All this talk about Teddy Bridgewater, Adrian Peterson and rookie Stefon Diggs, but I love the Vikings for that young defense. It's an embarrassment of riches, filled with glowing gems like Everson Griffen, Linval Joseph, Xavier Rhodes, Harrison Smith and Anthony Barr. Rookies Eric Kendricks and Trae Waynes could end up being the best of the bunch, but aren't being asked to play big roles just yet. Mike Zimmer has a contender in the NFC, and with the Packers sputtering, this would give the Vikings a two-game lead and a tiebreaker in the division. You better believe the Minnesota crowd, outdoors in that college stadium, will be in an absolute frenzy.
The Pick: Vikings 33, Packers 20
Denver Broncos at Chicago Bears: The Brock Osweiler experiment begins and if there's any two coaches who know him better than his current ones, it's John Fox and Adam Gase, his former head coach and offensive coordinator, now working wonders with Jay Cutler in Chicago. A former Bronco himself, Cutler is having his best three-game stretch in some time and Chicago's playing really good football despite a rash of injuries on both sides of the ball. I like Gase's new project to beat his old one on Sunday.
The Pick: Bears 27, Broncos 21
Tampa Bay Buccaneers at Philadelphia Eagles: Mark Sanchez, expected to start on Sunday, has thrown an interception in all but two games he's started for the Eagles. Not a good statistic. But this is must-win for Chip Kelly's Eagles and with a full week to prepare, I'll give Philadelphia the edge at home. That's with or without Jason Peters or Connor Barwin.
The Pick: Eagles 27, Buccaneers 23
Cincinnati Bengals at Arizona Cardinals: If it seems like Larry Fitzgerald is having one of the best seasons of his career, it's because he is. Fitzgerald's 65 catches, 836 yards and seven touchdowns are the most he's ever had in any season — in all three categories — through nine games. There's a fountain of youth thing going on in Arizona and I want some. They win again on Sunday.
The Pick: Cardinals 24, Bengals 17
San Francisco 49ers at Seattle Seahawks: It's been a long and strange 2015 season for the 49ers and their fans. The road trips have been the worst part. San Francisco is 0-4 on the road, with blowout losses at Pittsburgh, Arizona and St. Louis. Jim Tomsula reportedly spent a portion of the bye week with his coaches trying to figure out why the team hasn't played well in away games and coming up with ways to change their fate. I don't see playing in Seattle as the ideal testing ground for those new tactics.
The Pick: Seahawks 30, 49ers 17
Kansas City Chiefs at San Diego Chargers: Kansas City is quietly creeping up on the Broncos in the AFC West standings, but I like the ‘Bolts off a bye to silence any talk of that on Sunday. The last time we saw San Diego, Philip Rivers was getting knocked around by the Bears defense and losing yet another heartbreaker on a Monday night. The Chargers offensive line is struggling and will overcome a rash of injuries to somehow find a way.
The Pick: Chargers 27, Chiefs 21
Buffalo Bills at New England Patriots: Another Bills game and yet again, Rex Ryan is somehow the story. Maybe he shouldn't be. Maybe one of his players, like rookie Ronald Darby, deserves a little pub. General Manager Doug Whaley's first pick of the 2015 Draft (Buffalo gave up its first-rounder in the Sammy Watkins trade) has been lights out at cornerback and already has set a Bills rookie record for most passes defended. The Bills are going to give the Patriots a game on Monday. But no, they're not winning.
The Pick: Patriots 27, Bills 20
READER EMAIL OF THE WEEK
Peter,
I'm flipping through the sports channels Tuesday night and I see you with Mike Garafolo and you're looking all astute and academic with a pocket square and you say that you'd rather have Joe Flacco, Andy Dalton and Ben Roethlisberger as your team's quarterback than Johnny Manziel on Fox Sports 1. Well, NO CRAP DUDE. And I'd rather have a Victoria's Secret model than my girlfriend. Sometimes you don't get to just PICK. You make the most of what you've got. Why can't we Brown fans just be allowed to enjoy this for a moment without all you guys raining on our parade? Johnny may not be a Hall of Fame quarterback but he's better than anything we've had since Kosar.
Heath, Shaker Heights, OH
Heath,
Please print that email (and this article) and present it to your girlfriend. I'm sure she loved that analogy and I'd love to see her reaction. And I'm rooting for Johnny! He's good for the sport. Football's better when the Browns are relevant.
Week 11 Cheat Sheet Trivia Answer: Prior to Cousins, Sammy Baugh was the last Redskins quarterback with more than 300 passing yards and a passer rating of better than 150 in a game. He did it in 1948.

As a beer loving community the Sommbeer crew has decided to do a series of collaborative post's that we will be calling “Sommbeer's Favorites”. The purpose of these posts are just to give a brief look at some of each contributor favorite brews are of a particular style. This post is dedicated to Sommbeer's favorite IPA's
Alex:
I am a big fan of Boulevard Single Wide IPA. This is the beer I got my start in craft beer with. It is a nice crisp beer. With only 57 IBUs it is not overpowering and easily palatable. Goes great in the summer and an awesome with a good burger. Next from Boulevard I would go to their Double Wide IPA or the Calling IPA.
Deschutes Fresh Squeezed IPA is nice clean easy drinking beer. I know quite a few people who avoided hops like the plague until they tried this. Now they have been broadening their horizons to more and more IPAs. This is a very good transition beer from sweet to the bitter of IPAs.
Andy:
Despite being confused by its long name, Clipper City Heavy Seas Loose Cannon IPA has been one of my favorites of this great style of craft beer. I couldn't figure out which was the name of the brewery and which was the name of the beer, or why there was an extra name seemingly thrown in. But, I did know that the beer had a great citrus flavor and a good balance between the flavorful hops and a strong malt backbone. It was the first IPA I drank that didn't completely overwhelm me with bitterness. Since trying this small beer from Baltimore, I've discovered many other great American IPAs (such as Sculpin, Racer 5). But I'll always have a soft spot for Loose Cannon.
Bill:
As a self proclaimed hop head IPA's and all the different type of IPA's are my favorite type of beers. In recent months, in my travels to Phoenix, AZ I was able to try the Camelback IPA by The Phoenix Ale Brewery. I really enjoyed this beer and the fact that it came in a can improves the drink-ability. I enjoy having a a nice IPA on a hot spring/summer afternoon at the ball park or after doing yard work. Camelback IPA definitely has that drink-ability that you want with a good IPA.
Don:
Lagunitas IPA, Don's Favorite IPA
Is it hypocritical to recently write a post calling Zombie Dust the best IPA that I have ever had, then pick another IPA as my favorite? At the very least i0t shows a lack of consistency, right? Well, in an effort to justify my choice I want to point out what my criteria is for calling a beer a “favorite”.
1) It has to be year-round and readily available. I don't want to have to trade a kidney to get it, and at the very least it has to be distributed in the state that I live in. It also has to be something I can find in a grocery store or gas station cooler in case of emergency.
2) It has to be reasonably priced. I don't want to call it a favorite if it costs me over $15.00 a four pack. That is not a favorite that is an indulgence.
3) It has to be a more multi-purpose beer that I can drink anytime and for any occasion and I want to be excited to have one no matter when or where I find it.
4) It can't be only viewed as a default beer that I settle for when I end up somewhere that has weak handles. This is one that I have to willingly choose when there are other options.
Based on these criteria, my go-to IPA has to be Lagunitas IPA. Not only does it meet all of my IPA criteria, it is uniquely delicious. Nothing else tastes like Lagunitas IPA (except other beers by Lagunitas…has anyone else noticed that many of their beers taste the same…? Of course I like how they taste so it does not really bother me, I just wanted to point it out). There is a great balance of hops and malt, citrus and sweet, and at 6.4% you can have a couple without getting light headed. Lagunitas IPA also passes my “favorite” test. It is readily available, year round beer. You can get Lagunitas IPA virtually anywhere. You also see it in bars without a great beer selection so you don't have to settle for Killian's Iris Red. Lagunitas IPA is also reasonably priced and sold in six packs. You can typically get a six of Lagunitas IPA for $9.99 to $11.99. Lagunitas IPA really can be imbibed all year, any time of day, and after any activity. It is a really approachable beer with a lot of flavor, enough hops to matter, and that unique Lagunitas flavor. Finally, I have ordered Lagunitas when there have been other great choices for me to drink. I don't look at Lagunitas IPA as a “bail out beer”. Zombie Dust meets some of my “favorite” criteria too; it is year round, and reasonably priced but it is hard to find, and is not available in Michigan. Of course you already know that if I lived in Indiana, Ohio, or Illinois, my favorite IPA would be Zombie Dust, but since I am a Michigander, and Lagunitas is all over the place, I have to go with Lagunitas as my favorite IPA.
David (Sommbeer):
My everyday IPA isn't anything special – that's why it's special to me. It's sold at every store around me (it's what some folks call “gas station beer”).
Yet, it's the beer I root around my refrigerator to find. It's an IPA that I really enjoy but don't think too much about once I start drinking it.
My everyday IPA is Centennial from Founders Brewing. For craftbeer fans, the IPA is becoming relegated as a common ordinary beer. I see no issue with that.
It's a style of beer that I find comforting – like meatloaf. I don't care how this beer rates on the world stage (I never looked) and I don't brag about drinking it but boy is it good after a long day.
Why I chose Centennial IPA – Affordable, Available, nice ABC @ 7%, tastes great but not over-powering (or thought provoking)
Ed:
Dark Horse Crooked Tree IPA
Dark Horse is aptly named as it brings a lesser known and much less talked about addition to the admittedly great selection of Michigan-brewed IPAs. But it's great. You should drink it. Or don't. Look. I'm not your dad.
John:
IPA is by far my favorite style of beer and more often than not is what I find myself buying or ordering on any given night. Norm's Raggedy Ass IPA is my go-to IPA right now. The beer is crisp and refreshing, easy to drink and pairs well with most any meal I can think of. Being packaged in cans is also a plus for me because a 4 pack is not only affordable it's a bit more portable than a glass 6 packs.
Lindsay:
IPAs are my favorite because they can vary so much. This makes it a fun beer because you can always try something new at each grocery store or bar. Well, until your options run out. Haha. I prefer the higher alcohol content ipas because they normally have a higher level of hops. Galaxy and cascade are my favorite hop varieties and I have even started growing my own in Iowa. Molotov cocktail is probably my favorite. Or 8 bit by tallgrass
Matt:
Picking a favorite IPA, for a most craft brew lovers, is akin to a child picking his or her favorite toy – it isn't easy and it often changes. I honestly wasn't sure I could pick just one. As I began to write this, I pictured myself like TV's Bachelor in a room with 20 IPAs hoping to receive a rose – or maybe a snifter – and win me over as the best IPA.
Many “hop heads,” such as myself, often debate the style of IPA they enjoy, the merits of dry hops vs. wet hops, and more. Personally, I enjoy IPAs that contain a balance of powerful hops-bitterness with other flavors, such as malt, and leaves the beer drinker with a pleasant aftertaste. For the purposes of this article, I only considered well-known IPAs, which should not be interpreted as partiality towards them over small-batch breweries – perish the thought! I restricted my selection to larger brands simply for the sake of argument; one can't engage in discourse over a beer that no one else has tasted.
After days of pondering, it finally hit me; my favorite IPA involves more than taste, it involves an experience. After much thought, I finally concluded that Odell Imperial Pale Ale exists as my favorite IPA.
Why? First, the beer is absolutely perfect for a hop head such as myself. The intensity of the hops within Odell's IPA resembles that of some DIPAs. However, the noticeable addition of malt, the delicate inclusion of citrus and the floral aroma provides tremendous balance to the bitterness emanating from the hops. Furthermore, the gentle carbonation provides texture to the beer without negating its smoothness – it goes down like a glass of iced tea on a hot summer day. Simply put, Odell IPA is not a one-note beer, it is a venerable symphony of flavors, scents, and sensations.
Second, I have a soft spot for Odell. As one who just began to appreciate craft brews in the early 2000s, a trip to Ft. Collins changed me forever; I toured New Belgium, Fort Collins, and Odell breweries. Consequently, I transitioned from a fan of craft brews to a dedicated craft brew enthusiast (and now, of course, I'm a full-fledged beer snob.) Several beers from those breweries remain among my favorites, but Odell provides the best IPA of the three. That experience, coupled with the quality of the beer, make it my favorite.
Stephanie:
I feel like I generally tend to lean towards dank tangy, fruity beers with Mosaic hops or Amarillo hops… OR Galaxy hops! The fruitier, the juicier the better in my opinion. That being said, it's kind of funny that my favorite IPA isn't a Citra hopped beer by any means… No Mosaic or Amarillo to be found either.
The most memorable, utterly unique beer I've ever had the pleasure to endulge in, would have to be Zeelander brewed by the fine people at Toppling Goliath Brewing Co.
This American IPA blew my mind! The main hop used is Nelson Sauvin hops (from New Zealand) which creates this bold bitter, complex citrusy, fruity flavor that really erupts in you mouth with each sip. I can see why I enjoy this beer so much because it does have fruit and tangy citrus notes, but this beer really changed my mind about Nelson Sauvin hops and made me curious to try more beers that used Nelson.
I guess you can say it expanded my palate. That's why I believe Zeelander to be my favorite IPA.
Even though It's not my favorite style, this beer opened my mind and really challenged my palate.
Not to mention, it was devastatingly delicious.

Ernest Hemingway's romantic adventure of man and marlin, The Old Man and the Sea, has perhaps spent more time on high school freshman English reading lists than any other work of fiction, which might lead one to think of the novel as young adult fiction. But beyond the book's ability to communicate broad themes of perseverance, courage, and loss, it has an appeal that also reaches old, wizened men like Hemingway's Santiago and young, imaginative boyish apprentices like his Manolin. The 1952 novella reinvigorated Hemingway's career, won him a Pulitzer Prize, and eventually contributed to his Nobel wins in 1954. And luckily for all those high school English students, Hemingway's story has lent itself to some worthy screen adaptations, including the 1958 film starring Spencer Tracy as the indefatigable Spanish-Cuban fisherman and a 1990 version with the mighty Anthony Quinn in the role.
One adaptation that readers of Hemingway might miss is the animation above, a co-production with Canadian, Russian, and Japanese studios created by Russian animator Aleksander Petrov. Winner of a 2000 Academy Award for animated short, the film has as much appeal to a range of viewers young and old as Hemingway's book, and for some of the same reasons—it's captivatingly vivid depiction of life on the sea, with its long periods of inactivity and short bursts of extreme physical exertion and considerable risk. Both states provide ample opportunities for complex character development and rich storytelling as well as exciting white-knuckle suspense. Petrov's film illustrates them all, opening with images of Santiago's stories of his seafaring boyhood off the coast of Africa and staging the dramatic contests between Santiago, his "brother" the marlin, and the sharks who devour his prize.
But the production here, unlike Hemingway's spare prose, makes a dazzling display of its technique. For his The Old Man and the Sea, Petrov—only one of a handful of animators skilled in this art—handpainted over 29,000 frames on glass (with help from his son, Dmitri) using slow-drying oils. Petrov moved the paint with his fingers to capture the movement in the next shot, and while the magical effect resembles a moving painting, the shooting itself was very technologically advanced, involving a specially constructed motion-capture camera. Petrov and son began their painting in 1997 and finished two years later, taking to heart some of the lessons of the book, it seems. The film's creators, however, fared better than The Old Man's protagonist, richly rewarded for their struggle. In addition to an Oscar, the short won awards from BAFTA, the San Diego Film Festival, and a handful of other prestigious international bodies.

ESPN Pulls Announcer from UVa Football Game Because His Name is ‘Robert Lee'
Well, this is sure to cause a stir.
ESPN has announced plans to pull an announcer named Robert Lee from calling a University of Virginia football game. Because his name is Robert Lee.
A statement from ESPN reads:
We collectively made the decision with Robert to switch games as the tragic events in Charlottesville were unfolding, simply because of the coincidence of his name. In that moment it felt right to all parties. It's a shame that this is even a topic of conversation and we regret that who calls play by play for a football game has become an issue.
Some may see this as a lovely and sensitive move in light of the deadly protests in Charlottesville, Virginia.
Others are sure to mock and ridicule as a well-intended FAIL of epic proportion.
Either way, it is sure to be cable news fodder for days to come!

Minister of the Macabre Damian Michael AKA HalloweeNut Good evening, Mesdames & Messieurs, and welcome to my lair; I hope you have your affairs in order. My name is Damian Michael, formerly known as the HalloweeNut. This is my dark little corner of the Internet, where you can read the chronicles of my various morbid obsessions, which include (but are certainly not limited to) Halloween, Haunted Attractions, Horror, Writing, Cinema, Music, Art, the Paranormal, the Occult, Serial Killers, Sex, Death, and the downfall of the human race. I used to run a home haunt at my parents' house for six years, before moving out on my own. I hope to haunt again someday, hopefully on a professional scale. For me, Halloween never ends; it just goes on and on. I am currently a student at a university, majoring in English. I hope to be a novelist one day. I also make ends meet by writing for Obscure Ink Magazine, a tattoo and body mod magazine. I intend to use this blog to share whatever macabre projects I am working on, along with topics of a morbid nature I come across. So I invite you to take off your coat, look around, and see what kind of horrible things I am capable of. I have such sights to show you… View my complete profile
Dead Memories
Under the cover of a large umbrella, Shiron Hagens trudges through a Jennings shopping center parking lot that borders Ferguson. She stops just outside a store. Hagens is not here to shop, but to register voters.
Following the death of Michael Brown many people joined marches and protest. Hagens started registering.
“There was just this obvious disconnect between what our leaders thought was going on, and what the community felt had been going,” said Hagen. She thinks this has made others realize “that they are not the right representative for us if they don't understand our issues.”
The disconnect between residents and local officials has boiled over at public forums and meetings. Many have expressed frustration over the fact that, while nearly 70 percent of Ferguson residents are black, five of the six city council members and the mayor are white.
But to change leadership, the community might have to change its voting habits. In the 2013 municipal election just over 12 percent of eligible voters cast ballots.
Hagens and her mother have worked to register voters in the Ferguson community for past three Saturdays. They aren't part of an organization -- Hagens doesn't even live in Ferguson -- but she wants people throughout north county to get more involved in local elections.
Hagens has experience registering voters. She canvassed during the 2008 and 2012 election season. When she wanted to help the community after the unrest, she decided to push political action.
“Marching isn't quite my thing. I don't think it's active enough and I don't see the direct results from the marching, so I thought I needed to actually do something. This I how I decided to contribute,” Hagens said. “We've made a commitment to be here every Saturday before the 6th of October, which is the last day you can update your address.”
Their goal is to register 50 people a day. So far, their highest tally for a day is 29. Typically voter registration drives are prominent during national and state elections. Hagens says it's just as important to promote local elections.
“In local elections that's where you really see the difference people can make,” Hagens said. “One thousand people can swing elections, 500 people can be the difference between one person winning and another person winning. It's that small of a difference.”
A changing population
Over the past 20 years, Ferguson's demographic makeup has shifted from three-quarters white to two-thirds black.
Terry Jones, a political scientist at the University of Missouri-St. Louis, says that although the city's overall population has shifted, its voting base hasn't.
“The residential population of African Americans is typically younger,” Jones said. “A higher proportion of them are under 18, therefore are not eligible to vote. And they are less interested, as newcomers, in local politics. Put all those things together and I suspect the electorate of the city of Ferguson is still majority white, especially the electorate in local elections.”
Jones says eventually this electorate will shift.
“The newcomers to a community take time to establish roots and to get involved in the community matters. They are less likely to both participate and ultimately run for office," Jones said. "It takes time for those roots to be established and that time typically is 20, 25 years.”
Jones also notes that Ferguson's low voter turnout is not unique.
“In local elections in St. Louis County in general, the typical turnout as measured as percentage of registered voters is between 10 and 15 percent,” said Jones. “Sometimes if there is a hotly contested issue, they might get into the low 20s, but that is the exception, not the rule.”
Why people don't show
During the presidential election, voter turnout rates tend to be higher. According to a Washington Post article, 54 percent of registered black voters and 55 percent of white voters in Ferguson participated in the 2012 presidential election.
Patricia Bynes, the Democratic committeewoman of Ferguson Township, says municipal elections don't have the same draw as presidential elections.
“There is not as much money behind these municipal elections, if there is any money behind them,” Bynes said. “A lot of it is probably donated time and donated work by your family knocking on neighborhood doors. So it doesn't get the same attention that the national elections get.”
Bynes says part of what makes bringing attention to these elections more difficult is the large number of municipalities.
“There is no way (for general media) to cover what's going on and discuss all the issues of what's going on,” Bynes said. She said sometimes people don't even know there is an election.
The timing of elections also affects turnout. Ferguson holds elections on odd numbered years in April. This means state and national elections often don't coincide with local elections. Bynes says voting in April isn't a habit for most people.
“Most people are on that presidential cycle,” she said. “When you're on that presidential ballot, people who show up for president, they'll vote for the other things down the ticket. Now you're trying to create a whole new voting habit in April.”
St. Louis Alderman Antonio French, D-21st Ward, thinks another reason people don't show up is apathy.
“People too often feel that it does not matter, that when you are choosing between two imperfect candidates that it doesn't really matter which one gets in,” French said. “I think it has worked in the favor of some folks for a very long time to keep folks thinking that they don't have any power and that voting doesn't matter.”
Making voting matter
Organizations and individuals throughout St. Louis are hoping to change voter turnout. Voter registration groups and canvas trainings have popped up throughout the area in response to Michael Brown's shooting. A spokesperson for Rita Heard Days, the Democratic director of elections in St. Louis County, said they have received 109 new registrations in the past month.
One organization created with a focus on voting and empowerment is HealSTL. French is the organization's founder. He says registration is just the beginning. He hopes to use the momentum and emotion of the last few weeks to teach young people about the power they have to change their community.
“You want folks to understand their power as voters and we saw that a lot of people, especially young people didn't get the connection between voting, or the lack of voting and what we saw in the last few weeks,” French said. “So we need to see a lot of education done about that and then mobilization.”
For 15-year-old Devante Jackson, who goes by the name Low Key, this past month has provided him with a new appreciation for community activism and voting. He's from Ferguson, and voting was never on his radar. Now he's helping register voters part of the activist group Lost Voices.
“I never really thought about all that extra stuff and all that,” he said. “I never was really with it, and I never really understood how we vote and how it impacts our community.”
Devante says he hopes the entire community votes in the next election.
“I decided to pass out voter registration cards because our people need to vote,” he said. “Black people, all people need to vote because that's the only way that our world works is people voting, because the people in charge are the ones that make that decision but we impact that decision by how we vote.”
Devante said he knows that voting won't solve everything. There are a lot of other challenges the community has to tackle, but voting is an important part of his and Ferguson's future.
“This just changes my whole life, so I have no choice but be aware with politics all that, that's my job now, that's my duty, that's my responsibility."
Major League Soccer is the premier professional soccer league in the United States and Canada. Competition began in 1996, the 2016 season saw an average 21,692 spectators between the 20 teams, the highest average attendance in league history. MLS has the third-highest average attendance among all professional sports leagues with teams in the United States, ranking behind the National Football League and Major League Baseball but ahead of the National Basketball Association and National Hockey League. Among all North American professional sports leagues, MLS ranks fifth in average attendance per game behind the NFL and MLB as well as Liga MX and the Canadian Football League.
MLS attendance has grown since the early 2000s. The average attendance of 21,692 in 2016 was a 57% increase over the 13,756 average in 2000. The total attendance of 7,375,144 in 2016 is more than triple the 2,215,019 total of 2002. Similar to Major League Baseball and the National Hockey League, attendance is based on the number of tickets distributed.[1]
The Seattle Sounders' average attendance consistently exceeds 40,000 fans.
2017 season [ edit ]
The following is a list of the average attendance for each of the twenty MLS teams at their regular-season games. It includes the team, the average attendance during 2017 regular season, the average attendance during the 2016 regular season, the percentage change in attendance from season-to-season, the home venue, the home venue's capacity, and the percent of the home venue's capacity filled by the 2017 season's average attendance. For Atlanta United, which used two different stadiums in 2017, the percentages have been adjusted to reflect the number of home games at each venue.[2]
Notes
Some clubs have attendances over 100% capacity due to limited stadium capacity that is lifted during certain matches, when additional sections are opened. Other clubs use larger venues for certain matches that attract large attendances.
^ In its inaugural season of 2017, Atlanta United played its first nine home games at Georgia Tech's Bobby Dodd Stadium prior to the opening of the club's permanent home of Mercedes-Benz Stadium. ^ Atlanta United played its final eight 2017 home games at Mercedes-Benz Stadium. ^ Orlando City opened its current venue, Orlando City Stadium, in 2017. The team had previously played at Camping World Stadium , with an artificially restricted capacity of 19,500 but the ability to hold up to 62,510 for soccer.
* Stadium capacity artificially reduced for soccer matches
Season averages [ edit ]
Notes:
Green shading indicates record highs; red shading indicates record lows.
The drop in number of games and total attendance from 2000 to 2002, and the corresponding increase in average attendance, is attributable to league contraction, when MLS folded the Miami Fusion and Tampa Bay Mutiny.
MLS attendance vs. other North American leagues [ edit ]
The following table compares the Major League Soccer regular-season average attendance against the regular-season average attendance for the other professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada that have average attendances of at least 10,000 spectators per game.

A Democratic senator says she is working on two bills to strike down President Trump's executive order that temporarily bars immigration from seven Muslim-majority countries and refugees.
"Congress must take swift action in response to President Trump's discriminatory order," tweeted California Sen. Dianne Feinstein on Sunday.
Feinstein, the ranking member on the Judiciary Committee, said she is drafting the legislation that she will introduce Monday.
"The first bill immediately rescinds the order," Feinstein said. "The second limits executive authority under the Immigration and Nationality Act," an act that has been amended several times since it was created in 1952.
She added: "Under our bill, the president would not be able to unilaterally ban groups of immigrants."
Feinstein didn't offer any other details.
A slew of Democrats have made appearances at protests nationwide to oppose what they are calling a "Muslim ban" — a term that the Trump administration has pushed back against. The executive order has also become a cause for concern among some Republican lawmakers.
Sens. John McCain and Lindsey Graham said in a statement Sunday that the ban "will become a self-inflicted wound in the fight against terrorism." Another senator, Ben Sasse, of Nebraska, panned the executive order as being "too broad."
A federal judge in New York granted a temporary stay on the ban Saturday evening, which applies to travelers who have already arrived in the U.S. or those who are already travelling with valid visas. Similar legal rulings were reached in a handful of other states.
Chapman University recently completed its fourth annual Chapman University Survey of American Fears (2017). The survey asked respondents about 80 different fears across a broad range of categories including fears about the government, the environment, terrorism, health, natural disasters, and finances, as well as fears of public speaking, spiders, heights, ghosts and many other personal anxieties.
In addition to the set of fears examined in previous waves, the survey team took a closer look at one particular fear-related phenomena: fear of extremism.
In its fourth year, the annual Chapman University Survey of American Fears included more than 1,207 adult participants from across the nation and all walks of life that is a direct slice of the American population according to census data. The 2017 survey data is organized into four basic categories: personal fears, natural disasters, paranormal fears, and fear of extremism.
The 2017 survey shows that the top 10 things Americans fear the most are:
1) Corruption of government officials (same top fear as 2015 and 2016)
2) American Healthcare Act/Trumpcare (new fear)
3) Pollution of oceans, rivers and lakes (new in top 10)
4) Pollution of drinking water (new in top 10)
5) Not having enough money in the future
6) High medical bills
7) The U.S. will be involved in another world war (new fear)
8) Global warming and climate change
9) North Korea using weapons (new fear)
10) Air pollution
"The 2017 survey data shows us that while some of the top fears have remained, there has also been a pronounced shift to environmental fears," said Christopher Bader, Ph.D., professor of sociology at Chapman University, who led the team effort. "We are beginning to see trends that people tend to fear what they are exposed to in the media. Many of the top 10 fears this year can be directly correlated to the top media stories of the past year."
Environmental Quality Ranks among Americans' Top Fears
Most striking about American fear in 2017 is that environmental fears figure more prominently than ever before. Environmental issues never cracked the top ten fears in previous surveys. Water pollution ranks third overall, followed closely by drinking water quality.
Water Pollution
A majority of Americans [53.1 percent] fear pollution of "oceans, rivers and streams."
The fact that water pollution has become such a prominent fear in 2017 may be traced to the reversal of environmental policies of the Obama Administration.
Drinking Water Quality
50.4 percent fear for the quality of their drinking water. This could be linked to the prominent news coverage of lead poisoning in the drinking water of Flint, Michigan, during the past year.
Climate Change and Air Pollution
Americans fear climate change [48 percent] and air pollution [44.9 percent]. These are the eighth and tenth greatest fears, respectively. The sharp rise in the number of Americans who now say they fear climate change (and air pollution, which contributes to climate change) may be linked to President Trump's controversial decision to withdraw from the Paris Climate Accord.
Fear of Extremism and the Threat to National Security
Americans believe that both Islamic Extremists and White Supremacists represent a threat to national security. Three out of five Americans report they are very afraid or afraid that Islamic Extremists/Jihadists are a threat to national security. After Islamic Extremists/Jihadists, White Supremacists are the only group that a majority of Americans view as a threat to national security (51 percent).
While other types of extremist groups are a concern to large groups of Americans, only those two were identified by a majority of survey respondents. Roughly one-third of Americans identify the following four as threats: Extreme Anti-Immigration groups, the Militia/Patriot Movement, Left-Wing Revolutionaries, and Extreme Anti-Abortion groups. One in five Americans is afraid Extreme Environmentalists are a threat. "Although the trend isn't perfect, as a general rule, Americans are more afraid of extremist groups that have been discussed in the media," said Ed Day, Ph.D., chair of Chapman's sociology department. "Further, differences between various factions across America on which group represents the greatest threat reflects the political divisions we see in America on other issues."
This fear affects the daily lives of Americans and even leads some to question the value of American freedom?29 percent of Americans report being very afraid or afraid of being a victim of hate crime. One-third agree or strongly agree with the statement, "In order to curb terrorism in this country, it will be necessary to give up some civil liberties." Even more, 35 percent, disagree or strongly disagree with the statement, "We should preserve our freedoms even if it increases the risk of terrorism." As has been seen before, elevated fears over national security can lead to lower support for national values.
America's Knowledge of Disaster Preparedness Outdated, Dangerous
The survey asked Americans about fears of man-made disasters, such as a nuclear melt-down, and nuclear and terror attacks, as well as natural disasters. The survey then asked about their familiarity with safety and preparedness advice/slogans propagated by ready.gov and emergency.cdc.gov
Nuclear Fears
Nearly half of all Americans [48 percent] fear North Korea using nuclear weapons and 41 percent fear a nuclear attack generally. The prospect of a nuclear meltdown has made 31 percent afraid or very afraid.
"The survey also showed that it's the obsolete, even dangerous, cold war slogan "Duck and Cover" that is familiar to 70 percent of all Americans, said Ann Gordon, Ph.D., director of Chapman University's Henley Lab. "Americans need to unlearn 'Duck and Cover' and replace it with 'Get inside. Stay Inside. Stay Tuned'."
Terrorism and Mass Shooting Fears
48 percent fear being the victim of terrorism and 44 percent fear a terror attack in general.
The majority of Americans, 82 percent are familiar with the slogan, "If you see something, say something." However, most Americans are unaware of what constitutes suspicious behavior that should be reported. The fear of being the victim of a mass or random shooting is on the minds of 31 percent, and 35 percent report being familiar with the advice to "Run. Hide. Fight," which is the recommended preparedness slogan for a mass or random shooting.
Natural disasters
Americans fear many natural disasters and 68 percent believe natural disasters are capable of harming them or their property. Only 38 percent of Americans have heard the advice, "Don't wait. Communicate. Make your emergency plan today." Less than half, 41 percent (up from 32 percent in 2016), actually have an emergency plan in place for their households and 26 percent have such a plan for their pets.
"Whether they're afraid of an attack by North Korea, a pandemic (which 36 percent of Americans fear), or a natural disaster, Americans just aren't prepared," says Dr. Gordon. "Sheltering in place requires some preparation, such as food water, and medicine. Only 34 percent of Americans have such preparations, although 45 percent say they are familiar with the advice to "Prepare. Plan. Stay informed." And in any disaster a battery powered radio is essential to staying informed. This would be a great step towards preparedness for American households."
Paranormal America 2017
The 2017 Chapman University Survey of American Fears includes a battery of items on paranormal beliefs. Currently the most common paranormal belief in the United States is that ancient, advanced civilizations, such as Atlantis once exited with more than half of respondents (55 percent) agreeing or strongly agreeing with this statement. Slightly more than half (52 percent) believe that places can be haunted by spirits. More than a third (35 percent) believe that that aliens visited Earth in our ancient past and more than a fourth believe aliens have come to Earth in modern times (26 percent). Americans are the most skeptical about Bigfoot, with only 16 percent of Americans expressing belief in its existence. "The survey shows that paranormal beliefs are quite common in the United States by examining how many such beliefs a person holds," said Dr. Bader. "Using the seven paranormal items included on the survey, we find that only a fourth of Americans (25.3 percent) do not hold any of these seven beliefs. However, this means that nearly three-fourths of Americans do believe in something paranormal."
The survey also looked at the personal characteristics that are significantly associated with higher levels of paranormal belief. Simply put, the person with the highest number of paranormal beliefs in the United States as of 2017 will tend to be a lower income, female living in a rural area in the Western states. She tends to be politically conservative and claims to be highly religious, although she actually attends religious services infrequently. She is either currently single or cohabitating with someone and reports her race as "other."
Methodology
The CSAF was conducted online via the SSRS Probability Panel among adults age 18 and older who participated via the web on PC, laptop, tablet or mobile phone. It included 1,207 participants and data collection was conducted from June 28 to July 7, 2017. The SSRS Panel members are recruited randomly from a dual-frame random digit dial (RDD) sample, through the SSRS Omnibus Survey. The SSRS Omnibus survey is a national (50-state), bilingual telephone survey. The sample used for the Chapman University Survey of American Fears mirrors the demographic characteristics of the U.S. Census. For additional methodological details, see the full report.

View the Video County teachers making six figures
[Related: 23 top-paid administrators for schools]
The debate surrounding teacher pay often revolves around how low-paid the profession is. Pile-driver operators, make-up artists and court reporters are all paid more on average than teachers in San Diego County.
But by taking on extra assignments, gaining education, coaching teams and building up years of tenure, hundreds of local teachers now are making six-figure salaries.
U-T Watchdog ran the numbers and found that more than 500 teachers in San Diego County received wages exceeding $100,000 in 2013. The six-figure pay amounts to about 2 percent of the 24,000 public-school teachers in the county.
Add in the cost of health care, pension contributions and other benefits, and some 4,600 teachers are in the six-figure range for total compensation, or about a fifth, according to the U-T review of data collected by the group Transparent California.
Longevity is a factor, as teacher contracts award longer-serving teachers with more pay. Also, many of the top-paid teachers gave up a free period to teach an extra class, sacrificed lunch breaks to advise a student club or logged extra hours on Saturdays and during fall, spring and summer breaks.
What do you think of teacher pay in San Diego County? Too low 47% (1096) Too high 30% (692) Just right 24% (550) 2338 total votes.
Teachers topped out at about $135,000 in pay, or about $150,000 in total compensation.
Jorge Hernandez, a parent at Eastlake High in Chula Vista, said six-figure teachers have been worth it for his son. Physics teacher Leroy E. Price Jr. at that school has his doctorate, challenges the students and also coaches football. The data show Price was paid $110,223 in 2013.
“The district is getting a good deal for him,” Hernandez said.
Oceanside Unified parent Todd Maddison questioned whether longevity should be a factor.
“It does surprise me to find 500 teachers in the six-figure range. We hear a lot about how teaching is not a job that pays, but yet it does appear to pay for some,” said Maddison, a project manager for Toshiba. “Even in the real world, just because you get a credential or a masters, you don't get paid more. We don't hold them (teachers) to criteria that require that they demonstrate performance. Just because you've been somewhere for a long time is never a criterion to get paid more. In a private enterprise, you need to perform.”
For more Search educator pay data for county
Salary statistics compiled by the National Education Association show California public school teachers are some of the highest paid in the nation, consistently ranking among the top five states by average salary in the last decade.
From 2000 to 2013 their average salaries climbed 6.4 percent over and above inflation, but in recent years they have lost some of those gains.
In the 2012-2013 school year, the most recent year for which complete data are available, California teachers ranked fifth with an average salary of $69,324 — down from $72,803 in inflation-adjusted pay in the 2009-2010 school year. California teachers earned 21 percent more than the national average, and 8 percent less than the nation's top-paid teachers made, in New York.
One six-figure teacher, Gina Saclauso-Caro, joined the Sweetwater Union High School District in 1994 as a health and home economics teacher after earning far less in the Philippines.
Today, she carries an active workload teaching six science classes at Chula Vista Middle School, advising multiple student clubs and spending extra hours with struggling students after school, on Saturdays, and during school breaks.
Her pay topped $132,000 in 2013, or No. 3 in the county among her peers.
Saclauso-Caro, who has her master's degree and multiple teaching credentials, said her passion for students motivates her to put in the extra effort — not the money.
“I don't want to be somebody who is going to just go through the routine of teaching,” she said. “If you are going to be a teacher, be the very best you can be and that's what I do and that's my passion... That's what moves me and what powers me, to be able to touch lives who will become grown ups and make more children.”
The top-paid teacher in the data reviewed by the Watchdog was Tuyet-Mai Thi Vo, who taught biology at El Camino High School in Oceanside Unified. She was paid $135,997, most of it listed as “other pay,” likely a final payout after 18 years of teaching. Vo, 48, declined to comment, and district officials said they could not elaborate on the data.
The county's second highest paid teacher was Robert Barrett, who works in the learning center at Sweetwater's Eastlake High School. He also coaches golf and taught at least one adult class and summer school in 2013, boosting his pay to $133,805, the data shows.
Barrett did not respond to phone and email requests for an interview.
Another Sweetwater teacher, Tony Leon Valdez of Bonita Vista High School, was the county's fourth highest paid teacher.
His pay, according to the data, came in at $128,570, and included $3,330 for summer school and another $15,950 for teaching adult classes. Valdez also did not respond to requests for an interview.
Former Sweetwater schools administrator Karen Janney teaches educational leadership at San Diego State University, and said, “I think it takes a lot to get to that level… The majority of teachers work really hard for that pay and make a difference in the lives of kids, and that's kind of hard to measure.”
San Diego State University Professor of Educational Leadership Cheryl James-Ward said teacher pay is low for the demands that come with teaching 30 to 160 kids.
“When I was a classroom teacher, there was an additional five hours of work,” on top of six hours in the classroom and two hours planning, James-Ward said. “We know the greatest factor in student success is the quality of the teacher before them... I think they are all on the lower end. If you want the best teachers then you wouldn't start on the lower end.”
At least five teachers in San Marcos Unified earned six-figure pay in 2013, according to the data, and school board president Beckie Garrett said it is hard-earned.
“Nobody works any harder than a good classroom teacher. They take it home with them. They work nights, they work weekends. They are on all day long. I would never begrudge a good teacher for taking home a good salary,” said Garrett, who taught English to 180 students a day for 30 years and is in her eighth and final year on the school board. “That's very hard work if you are doing it right.”
At No. 5 in the county was Maureen Cottrell, who was paid $128,284 and teaches earth science, music, health and career preparation classes in San Diego Unified for students enrolled in the online iHigh Virtual Academy.
Cottrell, in her thirteenth year in the district, also coordinates the Operation Student Virtual Learning grant, as well as enrollment for more than 950 students who remain at their home high school but take one or two classes with iHigh.
Cottrell deferred comment on her job and pay to district officials, who said the former private sector chemist is “considered by her team to be a bit of a Wonder Woman due to the enormous responsibilities she takes care of, on a year-round basis, and with an extreme level of energy and dedication,” district spokeswoman Ursula Kroemer wrote in an email.
Mark Lowery just retired as band director at El Camino High School in Oceanside after 22 years in the district and 37 years overall teaching music. Jamie Scott Lyle
In Oceanside, now-retired music teacher Mark Lowery was paid $122,766. He gave up his preparation period, Saturdays and evenings to teach 300 students marching band, jazz band, orchestra and color guard at El Camino High for 22 years.
“Lots of weekends, lots of travel. This comes with the territory. If you are going to teach music, that's what you are going to do,” Lowery said. “We always joke we are making 37 cents an hour.”
Lowery said he made $9,000 his first year of teaching in 1976.
The top-paid Poway teacher was Candace Smiley, president of the Poway Federation of Teachers and advocate for higher teacher pay. Poway's teacher salary schedule tops out at $95,607 after 24 years, and Smiley said the average salary is about $75,000.
“Educators are underpaid for their years of education, experience, level of responsibility, hours required to do the job, and the skill set required to manage, educate, and support the number of young people they care for every day,“ said Smiley, who was paid $122,143. “Most importantly, teachers are ultimately responsible for the well being and academic success of all their students while in their care. This is a huge responsibility and no easy task.
“I laugh when parents tell me how exhausted they are when their children are home for the summer. I tell them to try teaching.”
Chiranjivi (Sanskrit nominative sing. ciranjīvi, चिरञ्जीवि) are seven immortal living beings in Hinduism who are to remain alive on Earth until the end of the current Kali Yuga
Etymology and scriptural context [ edit ]
The term is a combination of chiram, or 'permanent', and jīvi, or 'lived'. It is same as amaratva, which refers to true immortality. At the end of the last Manvantara, a demon attempted to become immortal by swallowing the Vedas, as they escaped from the mouth of Brahma. The scripture was retrieved by the first avatar (Matsya) of Lord Vishnu. Incarnations of Vishnu (Narasimha and Rama) also later fought and killed two other asuras, Hiranyakasipu and Ravana, who tried to become immortal through obeisance to Lord Brahma and Lord Shiva, respectively. In one sense immortal can mean "to live eternally until the destruction of Universes," i.e.; all physical bodies are foretold to become immaterial at the end of time, along with the Brahma himself, with the destruction of the Universe.[1]
Attributes [ edit ]
The extant Puranas, the Ramayana, and the Mahabharata describe seven long-lived personalities in the Hindu pantheon. There are others as well, which are not included in the one particular shloka. Each represents a different attribute of man, which as long as they live, will exist amongst humanity.[2]
"Ashwatthama Balir Vyaso Hanumanash cha Vibhishana Krupacharya cha Parashuramam Saptaita Chiranjeevanam" - 'Ashwathama, King Mahabali, Vyasa, Hanuman, Vibhishana, Kripacharya and Parashurama are the seven death-defying or imperishable personalities'.
The Chiranjivis are as follows:
Vyasa, the sage who composed the Mahabharata. He represents erudition and wisdom. He was the son of sage Parashara and grandson of sage Vashishtha. He was born towards the end of Tretayuga, lived to see the complete Dwaparayuga, and also saw the initial phase of Kali Yuga.
Hanuman, served Rama. He stands for selflessness, courage, devotion, strength, and righteous conduct.
Parashurama, 6th avatar of Vishnu, knowledgeable about all astras, sastras and divine weapons. The Kalki Purana writes that he will re-emerge at the end of time to be the martial guru of Kalki. He will then instruct the final avatar to undertake penance to receive celestial weaponry, required to save mankind at the end time.
Vibhishana, brother of Ravana. Vibhishana surrendered to Rama before his battle with Ravana. Later, he was crowned king of Lanka after Ravana was killed by Rama. He stands for righteousness. Vibhishana is not a true Chiranjivi, as his boon of longevity is to remain on the earth only until the end of the Mahayuga.
Ashwatthama, the son of Drona, a great warrior. Drona did many years of severe penance to please lord Shiva in order to obtain a son who possessed the same valiance as Lord Shiva. Ashwatthama is the avatar of one of the eleven Rudras. Ashwatthama and Kripa are believed to be the lone survivors still living who actually fought in the Kurukshetra War.He might be immortal but Krishna gave him a curse that, he would live forever but can neither communicate with anyone nor touch anything, with his body covered with painful sores and ulcers that would never cure.[3]
Bali, also called Maha Bali (his son was Banasur), was the virtuous emperor of the three worlds and Son of Virochana and grandson of Prahlada who were of Asura descent. During the Vamana avatar, Lord Vishnu blessed him to be a Chiranjivi. Every year on the day of Onam (official festival of Kerala), he descends to earth from the heavens to visit his people, those of the region of Kerala.
Kripa, royal guru of the princes in the Mahabharata.
Other Chiranjivis [ edit ]
Jambavan
Markandeya
Devapi
Sage Maru
Saptarishis
Kag Bhusundi (Sage living in the form of a crow)
Muchukunda the son of Mandhatri
Banasur (son of King Bali) by Boon of Shiva
Udal.
Mention of Chiranjivi in Hindu Scripture [ edit ]
Hindu scripture contains a mantra about the seven immortals, in which their names are recited for luck and longevity:
अश्वत्थामाबलिर्व्यासोहनुमांश्च विभीषण:कृपश्चपरशुरामश्च सप्तैतेचिरंजीविन:।
Ashwathaama Balirvyaaso Hanumanshcha Vibhishanaha Krupascha Parshuramascha Saptaitey Chiranjivinaha[ citation needed ]
Apart from the seven Chiranjivis above mentioned, there exist other Chiranjivis as well. For instance, Sage Markandeya, who at the age of sixteen was blessed with immortality.
अश्वत्थामा बलिव्र्यासो हनूमांश्च विभीषण:। कृप: परशुरामश्च सप्तएतै चिरजीविन:॥ सप्तैतान् संस्मरेन्नित्यं मार्कण्डेयमथाष्टमम्। जीवेद्वर्षशतं सोपि सर्वव्याधिविवर्जित॥
Ashwathaama Balirvyaaso Hanumanshcha Vibheeshanaha Krupaha Parshuramascha Saptaitey Chiranjivinaha Saptaitaan Samsmareynnityam Markandeymathaashtamam Jivedvarshshatam Sopi Sarvavyadhivivarjit
इस श्लोक का अर्थ यह है कि इन आठ लोगों (अश्वथामा, दैत्यराज बलि, वेद व्यास, हनुमान, विभीषण, कृपाचार्य, परशुराम और मार्कण्डेय ऋषि) का स्मरण सुबह-सुबह करने से सारी बीमारियां समाप्त होती हैं और मनुष्य 100 वर्ष की आयु को प्राप्त करता है।
The above lines mean that by daily remembering these 8 immortals (Ashwatthama, King Bali, Ved Vyasa, Hanuman, Vibhishan, Kripacharya, Parashuram and Rishi Markandaya) one can be free of all Ailments and live for ever. These are also referred to as the 8 great warriors.
Pine piles are forming the base for a State Highway 1 extension on Kahikatea Drive.
Hamilton's roads have gone to the logs.
The NZ Transport Agency is undertaking a $4million extension along the Kahikatea Drive part of State Highway 1 and more than a few mighty pine trees will be supporting it.
On completion the upgrade will rest on about 1500 pine piles, Hamilton City Council general manager infrastructure Chris Allen said.
Contractors Fulton Hogan have so far put 1300 of the piles into the ground, ranging in length from four to 13 metres, adding another layer of support for the roading which is being built on soft peat soil.
The piles will be capped in cement, then construction aggregate will be spread on top before the tar seal is laid down.
The project will add lights to the busy intersection where Gallagher Drive and Quentin Drive meet Kahikatea Drive.
The project is expected to be complete by mid-August.
This is a small live demonstration of the Haskell library circle-packing by Joachim Breitner:
Given a number of circles with their radii, this packags tries to arrange them tightly, without overlap and forming a large circle.
Finding the optimal solution is NP hard, so only heuristics are feasible. This particular implementation is neither very good nor very fast, compared to the state of the art in research. Nevertheless it is simple to use and gives visually acceptable results.
This particular demonstration uses GHC-JS (from June 2015, using GHC-7.8.4) to generate JavaScript code from the original Haskell code and some code to address the HTML5 canvas, so although it runs in your browser, this is the Haskell code at work. There is an analougous demo based the Fay compiler, and one using haste.
Morten Pedersen, a local DeLand videographer had a bit of a shitty day at work recently. Or a really good day, depending on how you look at it. After an uneventful tandem video, he deploys his Velocity 103 main and encounters a brake fire. The canopy spins up and Morten cuts away. The main canopy takes off with the SkyHook and as you can see in the video the freebag/reserve pilot chute are thrown around wildly. The red SkyHook lanyard breaks and once the reserve canopy is clear, Morten works hard to get an inflated reserve over his head.
Mission accomplished about 150 ft off the ground – aims for the nearest available clear area and flare…. In this case a little extra altitude at the top definitely saved the day and the big sigh at the end of the video says it all. Well done Morten – a good reminder to all of us to never stop fighting.
This incident has promoted some discussion about the use of a SkyHook with high performance main canopies such as the Velocity. Morten has shared his footage with the manufacturers and they will review it closely to see what can be learned from this incident. For a bit of background, Morten has been in the sport for more years than we care to count and has extensive experience behind him in almost every facet of jumping. He was jumping a SkyHook equipped Sun Path Javelin, a Velocity 103 and an Optimum 126.
We would love to hear your thoughts on the topic in the comments or on Facebook, especially if you are one of those high performance pilots.

Taking a page out of liberal protests targeting Fox News' "Hannity" show, a top conservative group opened a campaign Wednesday targeting six MSNBC and four CNN political shows for skewing left.
"Today we are putting ten shows, and their major corporate sponsors on notice that we are watching their every move," said Brent Bozell, president of the Media Research Center.
"We are putting the radical left on notice that we are on to them," he added.
The targeted shows on MSNBC are "Politics Nation with Al Sharpton," "Hardball with Chris Matthews," "All In With Chris Hayes," "The Rachel Maddow Show," "The Last Word With Lawrence O'Donnell," and "AM Joy."
MRC also hits CNN's "Anderson Cooper 360," "CNN Tonight With Don Lemon," "Reliable Sources," and "Fareed Zakaria GPS."
The White House and GOP have been under fire on the shows, and the Republican National Committee Wednesday singled out one MSNBC show not on the MRC list: "Morning Joe."
"If there is a leader of the pack for the worst case of Trump Derangement Syndrome, look no further than MSNBC's 'Morning Joe,'" said Michael Reed, RNC's research director.
The group listed the advertisers of each show on its website. "We will be publicly listing the advertisers of these programs and asking them to defend their decision to continue airing ads on these shows. Every time one of their on-air personalities go beyond political commentary and engage in smear and hate, we are going to unleash an army of activists to contact these advertisers by phone and through social media to ask them why they are advertising on programs that are so biased, repulsive and morally bankrupt," said Bozell.
Bozell said, "We know the inside-outside game that radical organizations are playing with their leftist allies in the ‘news' media. The radical left's effort to silence conservative media by targeting their advertisers with coordinated smear campaigns has gone unanswered, but today is the day the conservative movement fights back, but with a big difference: We'll tell the truth. And we'll take no prisoners.
"Every network and cable news channel is today on notice that the MRC will be closely monitoring their leftist opinion programs and informing their advertisers and the American public when these programs and hosts go beyond political commentary and engage in smear, hate and political extremism. The difference between our effort and what the left is engaged in is that we will demonstrate to the advertisers of these programs how the hosts of these shows are not simply engaged in disagreeable political discussion but rather outright hate and personal character assassination."

If you undergo surgery in Canada the chance of a doctor leaving a scalpel or sponge in you is higher than it is in most developed nations in the world, according to a report.
The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) reviewed the highest incidence of “foreign bodies” left inside a patient post-surgery.
READ MORE: ‘Flexible blade' left inside Quebec woman's abdomen after cancer surgery
The most current data dates back to 2015. It shows Canada falls in the bottom quarter of the 20 OECD countries. The rate of a foreign object — such as a sponge, towel or scalpel — left in during a procedure happens 8.6 times for every 100,000 hospital discharges in Canada. Compare this with OECD average of five per 100,000.
“The most common item left behind is a sponge,” Katerina Gapanenko with the Canadian Institute for Health Information (CIHI) said.
“Other items are fragments of a device or surgical tools.”
Canada performs below nearly all of its peers, with the exception of Switzerland, New Zealand and Australia. Surgeons in countries such as the U.S. and Sweden, leave half as many foreign objects in their patients per 100,000 discharges.
Gapanenko said some surgeries do require tools to be purposefully left behind in a patient, but this data does not include that.
Despite the fact that these rates are low, around 165 of these preventable events occur each year in Canada, according to the CIHI.
These foreign objects may cause internal hemorrhaging, infections and other complications including death, Sandi Kossey, senior director at the Canadian Patient Safety Institute, said.
“The impact can be catastrophic,” Kossey said. “They don't happen frequently, but they should never happen at all,” Kossey said.
WATCH: Alleged misdiagnosis raising a lot of question on patient rights
The Canadian Patient Safety Institute created a list of “never events” in surgery — incidents that result in serious patient harm or death and are preventable using organizational checks and balances. Unintended foreign objects left in a patient following a procedure is third on the list (out of 15 incidents).
Quebec worst province
The OECD also looked at data on the number of foreign bodies left in patients after surgery in Canada. Quebec was not only the worst in the country, but also ranked the lowest out of all the OECD countries. The rate of a foreign object left in after surgery happens 13.2 times for every 100,000 hospital discharges Quebec.
READ MORE: 1 in 18 Canadian hospital patients experience harm from preventable errors: study
Manitoba ranked the second worst in the country as well as all OECD nations. It had a rate of 11.8 out of 100,000. Switzerland came in third with a rate of 11.6 out of 100,000.
Solutions?
The likelihood of these events increases when surgical teams are tired and distracted due to lengthy, late or multiple procedures, Gapanenko said. It's also likely to happen when procedures have multiple teams, she said.
“Operating rooms are incredibly complex and the stakes are high,” Kossey said. She said a lot of reasons these sometimes fatal errors happen in surgery rooms is because of a lack of teamwork and communication.
READ MORE: How widespread are prescription error problems in Canada? We don't really know
“There should be counting and double counting, trusting your gut instincts and speaking up when you feel something is off,” she said.
Using a surgical team checklist can reduce the number of these patient safety incidents, and most surgery teams in Canada use this, she said.
But more can be done, such an introducing bar-coded sponges, she said. The bar-code sponges have shown to prevent leaving them in patients, according to the CIHI.
Jan 19, 2015; Charlotte, NC, USA; Minnesota Timberwolves guard Mo Williams (25) shoots the ball over Charlotte Hornets center Bismack Biyombo (8) during the first half at Time Warner Cable Arena. Mandatory Credit: Jeremy Brevard-USA TODAY Sports
When Al Jefferson went down with a groin injury, playoff hopes for the Charlotte Hornets went down with him.
Their first game without Jefferson resulted in a loss to the Houston Rockets, placing our beloved buzz in the 12th seed of the Eastern Conference and four games out of a playoff spot.
The Hornets were done, right? Wrong.
Since that time, two heroes have emerged – one likely, and one out of the depths of the shadows. These two saviors are Kemba Walker and…Bismack Biyombo? Yes, Bismack Biyombo.
In Charlotte's ten January games, Biyombo has been putting up 6.9 points, 9.2 rebounds, and 1.6 blocks per game. Of those nine rebounds, four have been offensive boards. In fact, Biyombo had three straight games with seven offensive rebounds this month.
Biz's rebounding efforts have been a major reason why the Hornets are top-ten in the league this month in second chance points at 14.8 per game. For an offense that struggles to score, these additional points have been absolutely vital.
Let's not forget about Biyombo's electrifying effort on the defensive end of the court either. With Biz playing extended minutes, Charlotte has been the top team in the league in defensive rating (average number points allowed per 100 possessions) at 90.8.
Biz has become the epitome of a rim-protector, even notching five blocks in a close loss to the San Antonio Spurs. In fact, Biyombo has tallied at least one block in every game this month except for two (Cleveland and New Orleans).
Even if he's not blocking the shot, Biz's presence in the paint is enough to alter how an opponent shoots. Players know he's poised to swat anyone's shot away, which causes them to do one of two things: they either alter their shot, adding arc or putting it higher off the glass, or they avoid shooting inside altogether and kick the ball out for a lower-percentage shot.
While his stats can speak for themselves, his numbers aren't what have been his biggest contribution.
With a losing record, injuries, and the negative publicity of Lance Stephenson trade rumors, the air was taken out of this city. Biyombo's athletic plays have helped bring hope and excitement back to the Queen City. While that won't show up on the stat sheets, it goes a long way for the players and fans alike.
Now that Al Jefferson is working his way back into the lineup, it will be interesting to see how head coach, Steve Clifford, handles playing time. I doubt he would play both Jefferson and Biyombo at the same time, so odds are we'll be seeing less Biz as the games go on.
That being said, knowing that Biyombo has made huge strides in his progression will allow Clifford to rest Jefferson more down the stretch and ensure a healthy, energetic rotation at the five spot, should the Hornets find themselves in the playoffs.

Along the road heading towards the senkaimon, Renji who was at the very back of the group he was escorting, called out to Ichigo who was walking directly in front of him.
“……what is it?”
The distance separating them from the other three people ahead widened meaning their private conversation could not be heard.
“……Don't you think you should make things clear soon too?” said Renji.
“Huh?” Ichigo said, tilting his head in puzzlement.
“Don't play dumb……I'm talking about Inoue.”
“Whaa……!?”
Although he knew she wasn't close enough to hear them, Ichigo reflexively looked for Orihime's reaction. Orihime seemed to be having fun talking about something with Uryuu and Sado who were by either side of her.
“You're in love with her, aren't you?”
“……That is……!”
At Renji's blunt manner of speaking, Ichigo tried to force his words words out one by one.
“Don't keep such a nice girl waiting​ too long.”
”……I understand that" he said responding with a voice that seemed to disappear.
“……but….don't act so patronisingly​ all of a sudden……! And anyway, you were so slow it took you many decades yourself……”
At Ichigo's grumbling, Renji ran up to the three people walking​ in front. He called out to Uryuu and Sado and ushered Orihime away with a wave of his hand.
“That guy……! What is he up to!?”
Feeling dejected, Orihime dropped her shoulders and walked in Ichigo's direction.
“We're having a conversation just between the men, so you should go that way……”
“R…right….”
“Is Kurosaki kun going too? I'll walk at a distance from you all”
“No, I……”
He watched the group walking ahead of them. Renji looked at Ichigo and gave him a firm thumbs up as if to say ‘good luck'.
“……seems like I don't have to go over there”
“Oh, are you sure……?”
Orihime looks up at him in a questioning manner. “I'm too bad at expressing my mind!” Ichigo thought, feeling like he wanted to tear his hair out.
“Kuchiki san was so pretty huh……” Orihime whispered keenly whilst completely unaware of what was truly on Ichigo's mind.
“The veil suited her extremely well don't you think……? Haa……”
Recollecting the scene, Orihime seemed to be overcome with emotion, yet again her eyes began to fill with tears.
“Kurosaki kun, thank you for taking over the camera for me today! I'm looking forward to seeing the photographs……I'll arrange them properly into an album and then send a copy to everyone too!”
Orihime smiled at Ichigo whose face remained tense as he replied “yeah”.
“……what's wrong, Kurosaki kun?”
In response to Orihime frowning in​ concern, Ichigo shakes his head saying “it's nothing”.
Whilst they were having a silly talk, the senkaimon could be seen in the distance. The three people who were ahead, were already before the gate having a friendly chat.
Ichigo takes a very deep breath.
“Hey, Inoue”
Standing still, he looked at Orihime.
“What is it?”
Tilting her head to the side, Orihime looked up at Ichigo.
“There's……something I'd like to talk to you about, so next time, do you think you could you make some time for me?”
End.
And that's WDkALY complete! I think Matsubara did a wonderful job. Thanks everyone for your support.

× Expand Drew Hayden Taylor's play Spirit Horse has become the subject of a formal complaint over its use of the term "squaw."
There's a lot of talk in the media about the reluctance of Muslims and other ethnic minorities to vote in Canadian national elections. The same can be said for this country's First Nations people.
Voter turnout among aboriginals is lower than among non-aboriginals. Even the national chief of the Assembly of First Nations (AFN), Perry Bellegarde, has admitted to never having voted in a federal election. Ironically, Chief Bellegarde is urging native people to go out and vote in this election, to be part of this country's democratic practice, a very public instance of “Do as I say, not as I do.”
But that's okay. Only 330 or so chiefs can vote in AFN elections, an organization that claims to represent the vast multitudes of on-reserve native people stretching from ocean to ocean… but I digress.
Aboriginal reluctance to participate in this democratic exercise every four or five years is easily understandable when you look at the candidates for prime minister – all white, privileged and male, although Elizabeth May is only two out of three of these, which ain't bad.
For many indigenous people, voting is like shopping for white bread. It might be enriched but, really, does that make it any healthier?
This time around, though, exciting things are afoot aboriginally speaking. In at least 50 ridings across the country, native people could hold the swing vote. On top of that, there are 53 candidates running for office who identify as aboriginal, Métis or Inuit: four are running for the Conservatives, eight are Green Party, 18 Liberal and 23 NDP.
So on election night there could be a substantial splash of red (of the non-Liberal variety) on the Canadian political landscape.
When I was growing up, it was common to see Progressive Conservative signs spread liberally across lawns, including my grandfather's, on my reserve. At the time, this was a sign of gratitude, a response to the fact that it was the PCs under John Diefenbaker who gave native people the right to vote in 1960. Prior to that we were considered wards of the state and as such had no say in the direction of the country. This was better than in Australia, where all Aborigines didn't get the federal vote in all states and territories until 1967.
But nowadays, most people on the rez lean toward the Liberals or NDP. The changed nature of the Conservative Party has definitely had a negative effect on the political appetites of First Nations voters.
A good example would be the issue on the minds of most indigenous people this election: the 1,200 murdered and missing aboriginal women, and how each of the individual parties plans to address it – or not.
So far only the Liberals and the NDP have expressed an interest in holding a public inquiry.
The Conservatives continue to maintain that it's a criminal matter. They feel more comfortable dangling shiny big-ticket promises in front of us for our votes, like committing $567 million over five years to help build “stronger communities,” and $215 million for skills development and training for aboriginal people.
The Green Party continues its drive to be Indian-friendly, offering up a bevy of interesting promises, including removal of the two per cent fund-ing cap on First Nations education and full funding of the program backlog ($424 million).
Also high on their list is ensuring that any self-government negotiations do not lead to the extinguishing of aboriginal title rights or assimilation, and, most interestingly, a proposal to scrap the Indian Act. There's also an interest in fully implementing the recommendations of the 1996 Report Of The Royal Commission On Aboriginal Peoples. The original report set out a 20-year time-line to implement its recommendations. That would be… next year, I believe.
The Liberals are offering the most assurances. If given a mandate, Justin Trudeau and his crowd plan to provide, among other things, more money to support and enhance indigenous languages, an initial commitment of an extra $515 million a year for core education in First Nations schools (K to 12) for a total of $2.6 billion over four years, and the development of a “federal reconciliation framework” to resolve grievances related to existing historical treaties and land-claims agreements.
But let's not forget it was this man's father, along with Jean Chrétien, who first endorsed the controversial and coincidently named white paper in 1969 that basically called for eliminating any special recognition for native people by abolishing the Indian Act and dismantling the legal relationship between native people and the government of Canada. To put it mildly, it did not go over well with most of us. Natives became restless, and the proposal was quickly sacrificed on the altar of good judgment.
The New Democratic Party, meanwhile, is making a bunch of feel-good promises, including the creation of a cabinet-level committee, chaired by the prime minister, to ensure that federal government decisions respect treaty rights, inherent rights and Canada's international obligations. And building an all-weather road (an idea the Liberals also support) for the problem-plagued Shoal Lake 40 First Nation.
All the major parties, with the exception of the Greens, plan in some way to review or commit to the 94 recommendations released by the Truth And Reconciliation Commission on residential schools. All parties except the Conservatives plan to implement the United Nations Declaration On The Rights Of Indigenous Peoples.
Native well-being may not be as sexy as Senate misdeeds, but it is an area where a lot of us quite frequently feel wet and miserable. Surviving is a matter of picking the right umbrella.

New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio and other New York Democrats railed against the Republican tax plan. | AP Photo Playbook Beyond the Beltway New York Democrats rally against GOP tax plan -- Warren holds 16th town hall of the year
NEW YORK PLAYBOOK -- per Jimmy Vielkind and Laura Nahmias -- On Sunday, Mayor Bill de Blasio and other top Democrats, including U.S. Sens. Chuck Schumer and Kirsten Gillibrand, stood on the steps of City Hall and urged New Yorkers to throw themselves into the fight to kill the House and Senate GOP tax plans. “This tax plan hurts New York City to the core, and when you mess with New York City, New York City fights back,” de Blasio told the crowd. GOP House leadership is confident its version of that tax plan will pass sometime this week, but a few hours after de Blasio appeared at the rally, he announced he would be taking the whole week off, heading to Connecticut on vacation with his wife, with plans to return Friday.
Undoubtedly, the mayor is tired, and certainly deserves a break after packing his schedule in recent weeks leading up to last week's elections. But it's not the first time the mayor has declared war and then promptly left the battlefield. A day after he announced in June 2015 that Governor Andrew Cuomo was a vindictive person pursuing “revenge” against him, he departed for a summer vacation in the Southwest with his family. His administration announced plans that same summer to implement a cap on Uber, and the mayor went to Italy while the car-sharing company launched a scorched earth campaign to scare Council members away from the administration's idea. And, in early 2016, on the weekend after de Blasio announced he'd reached a deal on a plan to limit horse-drawn carriages on city streets, he headed to Iowa for four days, to stump for Hillary Clinton's campaign, giving just enough time for the deal to collapse. By the following Thursday, it was dead.
Story Continued Below
De Blasio has fielded plenty of criticism from people who say he spends more time on national issues than the local ones, and his response is always that he's advocating for the city's interests. In the federal tax reform bill, he's found a very real example of that — the bill would have an outsize impact on hundreds of thousands of his constituents. His message this week is confusing — either the fighting can wait 'til next weekend, or he's sending the signal that he's inessential to the battle. http://politi.co/2zmX4qK
NEW JERSEY PLAYBOOK -- per Matt Friedman -- The NJEA, smarting off an embarrassing and extraordinarily expensive loss against state Senate President Stephen Sweeney only to see him win by double-digits, has turned its ire on Star-Ledger editorial page editor Tom Moran, a harsh critic of the union.
Moran's offense: He tweeted that “Top Dems in NJ, deep down, want to murder the leaders of the teachers union.” That's not a good choice of words. It's also obviously hyperbole. I've certainly used that expression in casual conversation with people. Haven't you? Moran deleted the tweet.
The official line of the union is that Moran, a caustic critic of the union, should apologize. “There is no place in public discourse for the kind of violent language that Tom Moran used on Twitter yesterday. His casual reference to the alleged desire of some top Democrats to murder NJEA's leadership is disturbing and inappropriate,” NJEA spokesman Steve Baker wrote in an op-ed.
Moran told me he did apologize in an email to the union. “I do regret it. Some people apparently took me literally. It was a figure of speech,” Moran said over the phone. “I told the NJEA just before their email went out that I apologized to them directly. And I posted on my Facebook account: ‘Oops, sorry. My mistake.'”
But the NJEA is also retweeting from its official account tweets calling for Moran to be fired.
Those of you who have been here for a little while will remember the NJEA once found itself on the opposite side of a very similar situation, when its Bergen County president joked about wanting Gov. Chris Christie dead. Christie took umbrage and forced the statewide union's president to come to his office and apologize, inviting the media to catch her on her way out. Christie called for the Bergen County official's firing, which the NJEA didn't do. http://politi.co/2AkLRop
FLORIDA PLAYBOOK -- per Marc Caputo -- It's another committee week in Tallahassee ahead of the January legislative session. And like last week, the chatter is all about state Sen. Jack Latvala. We now know that Latvala faces a state Senate Rules Committee complaint about sexual harassment, and the still-anonymous accuser who filed it, her attorney tells POLITICO Florida, will likely and unwillingly be outed by the process and face political retribution. Latvala has vowed to fight the charges against him. So that virtually guarantees a big, ugly fight in the state Senate heading into the 60-day lawmaking session.
In this current climate of taking down men accused of sexual impropriety and harassment, how does Latvala survive? Yes, it's a majority GOP chamber. But regardless of party affiliation, the allegations from six women deeply trouble state senators. And many already believe the charges sound true. Also, a good number of Republicans aren't fans of Latvala (you should hear them off the record). There's a reason he lost the state Senate presidency to Joe Negron. So if the case goes forward, and only half of the 24 Republicans vote to expel him — they'll join the 15 Democrats who are almost guaranteed to vote as a block against him. (There used to be 16 Democrats, but his best pal in the state Senate, Democrat Jeff Clemens, resigned last month after admitting an affair with a lobbyist.) And 27 votes is the threshold to remove or censure a state senator in the 40-member chamber (it's only 39 due to Clemens' resignation). http://politi.co/2Asj1mn
MASSACHUSETTS PLAYBOOK -- per Lauren Dezenski -- Sen. Elizabeth Warren hit her 16th town hall of the year on Sunday in Greenfield — and with 908 attendees, it's one of her bigger town hall crowds to date (but not her biggest).
Warren's stump speech might have changed — it's sharpened over the past year — but her audiences remain as responsive as ever. She reliably enjoys big cheers, applause, and standing ovations as she winds through her own tales of the need to fight for the middle class or the misgivings of the Trump administration, peppered with her signature “fight”-based language and imagery (you can always count on talk about the middle class “up against the ropes,” with the threat of a “knockout blow”). Her most recent book is titled “This Fight is Our Fight,” after all.
The town hall audience inevitably wants to know how to get involved in the resistance against the Trump administration, and the fight to save the Affordable Care Act has become Warren's key example to point to. This spring, Warren would tell attendees to get active and get involved and to encourage loved ones in red and purple states to call their members of Congress who could be crucial deciding votes. Now, months later, the ACA fight has turned into a specific example where citizen resistance and pushback made a difference in the Trump era, Warren says. “We didn't have any more votes in Senate or the House, but the difference was you,” she said yesterday. “The difference was every single person who said ‘I'm in this health care fight.' Who posted on Facebook, who sent a tweet about it … You bet we want to get things done. And it's going to be tough and we're going to lose a lot of these fights. We can't fight on every front at every moment. … But it isn't a battle. It's like a muscle. The more you use it, the better you are.”
And the biggest mainstay of the Warren town hall: Her reliable, ice-breaking crowd-pleaser to shout out to everyone seated in the back of the room. “I can see you,” Warren mock-chides, craning her neck and pointing to the back of the always-packed hall. “I am a school teacher. And I know to keep an eye on all of the ones in the back of the room. You will be called on!” http://politi.co/2zAx2QZ
ILLINOIS PLAYBOOK -- per Natasha Korecki -- With veto session behind him, Gov. Bruce Rauner is making stops in Decatur and Champaign today as part of a week-long campaign tour. In an announcement, his camp says Rauner will discuss his agenda and “the next steps our state needs to overcome the corrupt system in Springfield and enact real reform that gives power back to the people.” Sound familiar? Rauner has some $65 million in his campaign fund but he has drawn a primary opponent -- state Rep. Jeanne Ives, a conservative lawmaker from Wheaton who threatens to mobilize Republicans who are livid with Rauner over his signature on a bill expanding the public funding of abortion and an immigration bill. http://politi.co/2zBwR7P
CALIFORNIA PLAYBOOK -- per David Siders and Carla Marinucci -- State Senate President Pro Tem Kevin de León on Saturday moved out of the Sacramento-area home he shares with state Sen. Tony Mendoza, the Artesia Democrat facing accusations of inappropriate behavior from two former female staffers.
From the SacBee's Taryn Luna: "The California Senate, its process for addressing complaints against lawmakers under fire, announced Sunday that an outside legal firm will handle all investigations of sexual harassment in the house going forward, shifting some control away from a committee of senators who previously controlled the process." http://politi.co/2icLDsi

The Bengals grabbed a win for the first time in more than a month and looked like a different team than we've seen all season in the process.
Cedric Ogbuehi didn't play one snap all game, joining AJ McCarron as the only two players on the active gameday roster to not take the field (even on special teams) in the Bengals' win over the Eagles. That was especially interesting to see as both Andrew Whitworth and Jake Fisher were injured in the game, but, Ogbuehi wasn't the beneficiary of their lost snaps. Somehow, Whitworth only missed four snaps after leaving with a knee injury as he returned in the fourth quarter. Luckily it seems neither injury will be significant moving forward.
Here are our snap count takeaways from the Bengals' win over the Eagles:

WASHINGTON (MarketWatch) — Newly released tax data gives a fresh breakdown of income inequality in the United States.
The Internal Revenue Service released a preliminary assessment of 2013 filings, based on what was submitted between January and late September. The data on individual income tax returns was then weighted to show a full year of tax data.
What the data show is that households who make $250,000 or more represent just 2.4% of filers, but 26% of all income. That's actually less than the 28% of all income they made in 2012, when a rush of special dividend payments were made in advance of a hike in tax rates.
Also see: How much it takes to join your state's 1%
The middle class — those who make between $50,000 and $100,000 — account for 22% of all filings and roughly the same in income, at 25%.
Put it another way: 3.6 million households make basically the same as 32 million households.
The largest bracket is those who make under $15,000, at 25% of the total, who bring in just over 1% of total income.
It's important to point out that those who make over $250,000 account for 48% of all tax liabilities, far and away the most of any bracket. Those who make between $50,000 and $100,000 account for 16% of all liabilities, and those who make between $100,000 and $200,000 account for 23% of all liabilities.
Some other factoids: some 33 million American households claimed $292.9 billion on the home mortgage interest deduction — that's 3.1% fewer households claiming 10.2% less.
There were 2.1% fewer households claiming the charitable contribution deduction, but those 36.6 million Americans gave only fractionally less, claiming $179 billion on their tax forms.
50 States of McMansion Hell: Cass County, North Dakota
Hello Friends! Today's house is about as depressing as literally any show or film that takes place in North Dakota. On the scale of overall McMansion-ness, this house is not as bad as some from other states, but the pickings were generally slim in North Dakota.
This angular abode, built in 1990, boasts 5 bedrooms and 5 baths, totaling around 4,500 square feet. If you're a beige fanatic, it can be yours for around $430,000 USD.
Sadly there's no lawyer foyer, so we'll have to dive right into the meatier parts of the house.

'It wasn't just a few buildings that were destroyed," recalls Eiko Otake. "It was an entire community that was gone. The earthquake, then the water, then the radiation. It was too much."
Otake is, of course, referring to the 9.0-magnitude earthquake that rocked the coast of Japan in 2011, triggering 10-story tsunamis and destruction that would lead to meltdowns of three nuclear reactors in Fukushima. Today, what's left behind is forbidden ground, largely still evacuated and quarantined due to high levels of radiation. Otake, however, has uncovered the beauty of the human condition through the rubble and twisted metal.
Otake, 62, and her husband and partner Koma Otake, 66, are based out of New York City and together form a highly acclaimed performance duo. For the past 42 years they've earned their accolades in the contemporary arts community by choreographing and performing Butoh-style (a highly diverse dance form that often involves white body paint and slow movement) dance shows and exhibitions worldwide. In 1996 they received a MacArthur Fellowship, or "Genius Grant"— the first ever given to a partnership, rather than an individual.
But this year Eiko Otake unveiled a solo project inspired while she waited for a train in Philadelphia. As she remembers it, "I was standing at the train station and I looked around at the space and the people," paying attention to how those particular bodies — coming, going, waiting — occupied that particular space. Then the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts approached her about a show.
"I called William [Johnston]," she says, "and asked him if he wanted to contrast a train station in Fukushima, Japan, with the one in Philadelphia."
So she flew to Fukushima with Johnston, photographer and professor at Wesleyan University in Middletown, Connecticut (where Otake has been serving as a visiting artist). Johnston took pictures of Otake in the station, and in the surrounding landscape. The product of this effort is A Body in Fukushima, a photography exhibit of 140 works, with two videos comprising still photos Otake "choreographed," edited and put to sound.
It debuted in Philadelphia in October, and a variation is coming to the Galleries of Contemporary Art this week. GOCA is one of just three venues currently slated to host the show.
It's not difficult to understand why this project is dear to Otake. Originally from Japan, she grew up well aware of the country's tense nuclear history. "A lot of people may not know or realize that Japan is the only country to ever have a nuclear weapon used against it in history," she says. "The irony is that survivors of Nagasaki and Hiroshima have no idea why the Japanese government hasn't fully educated itself on radiation. This is very humiliating to people who were radiation survivors."
So she applies her gifts. "I feel if I could use my body as a conduit, that would be good," Otake says. "I want people to feel the relationship between my poses, to my presence, to the landscape behind my body."
Former President Jimmy Carter pulled no punches against Donald Trump in a recent interview with The New York Times.
The 39th commander in chief told the newspaper by phone on Monday that Mr. Trump's Republican presidential campaign is fueled by lingering U.S. racism.
Mr. Carter, 91, said in February that the billionaire was his favorite Republican candidate because he is “completely malleable.” The former Democrat president now says Mr. Trump “tapped a waiting reservoir there of inherent racism” to succeed.
“When you single out any particular group of people for secondary citizenship status, that's a violation of basic human rights,” Mr. Carter said of the Republican's plan to deport illegal immigrants and temporarily halt Muslim immigration into the U.S.
The newspaper also asked Mr. Carter, who is planning to hold a summit of Baptists in Atlanta, Georgia, later this summer, why Mr. Trump's support among evangelical Christians is so strong.
“The use of the word ‘evangelical' is a misnomer. I consider myself an evangelical as well. And obviously, what most of the news reporters thought were evangelicals [over the years] are conservative Republicans,” the former president said.
Mr. Carter created the New Baptist Covenant in 2008 to bring together ministers from across the country. Roughly 15,000 individuals from 30 Baptist organizations attended its founding meeting.

Everywhere you look on the McNeil elk feed ground west of Bondurant, you see the bones and hides of dead elk. Rancher Steve Robertson says many are left behind from wolf kills. He tells of seeing elk chased by wolves here just this last winter.
“The steams boiling off them, their tongues are hanging out,” he says. “And then two weeks later all those elk were killed on the feed ground. And the elk, they can't go anywhere they're snowed in, they're trapped.”
Such a high surplus killing, as it's called, with 19 elk killed and left uneaten in one night, has never been seen before on Wyoming's elk feed grounds. Then in another instance this winter, a second pack of wolves known as the Dell Creek Pack, also started killing large numbers of cattle. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service can't act when wolves commit surplus kills on elk, their natural prey. But when they started chronically killing cattle, the agency decided to do what they promised when they introduced the species 20 years ago: they started killing off the wolf pack.
Today, Robertson is taking me on a horseback ride to get a view of his grazing allotment that borders the McNeil elk feed ground where the 19 elk were killed. In just a couple weeks, he'll be releasing thousands of head of cattle into this country. Riding up the ridge, we see lots of wolf tracks.
“We had a hard rain two days ago? Three days ago?” he says, climbing off his horse to get a closer look. “These tracks, they were made in that rainstorm.”
He says, he's never had problems with wolves in the past, but now with so many large packs moving in, his job has gotten harder.
“We put our cattle where they need to be and go back the next day and the wolves have chased them out of there. So that's a daily effort to try to comply with our permit,” he says. “Plus, if you're moving your cattle all the time, they don't grow.”
Robertson says he'd like to see the wolves taken off the Endangered Species List again, like they were from 2012 to 2014. He says, in those days, there weren't so many conflicts because hunting kept wolf numbers under control, and the Wyoming Game and Fish Department had more people managing them.
One was Large Carnivore Biologist Ken Mills. He says what's happening in Bondurant is rare. He shows me a moose jaw from a wolf kill with tooth decay so bad it ate a hole through the bone.
“You know, that's way beyond a root canal,” he says. “So you can imagine the pain that that one's dealing with.”
Pain that ended when a wolf took the moose down. Mills says wolves keep elk herds healthy by killing the diseased. He says it's unknown whether the 19 elk killed were sick, but hoof rot has spread and killed hundreds of elk on feed grounds recently.
But Mills says, whatever the reason for the surplus kill, there's still too many wolves in the area.
“The goal of the Game and Fish is to manage wolf populations at a level that's low enough to sustain elk populations,” he says. “And we know what that level generally is six to seven wolves per 1000 elk.”
At Bondurant, there's now 25 wolves for 1500 elk. U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Wolf Coordinator Mike Jimenez says it's not just Bondurant that's seeing lots of wolves.
“It's the highest population in the history of the program,” Jimenez says. “There are over 380 wolves in over 48 packs in Wyoming.”
In the original agreement, though, the state only agreed to manage 100 wolves in ten packs. Jimenez says the wolves have run out of good mountain habitat and are moving down into ranching country, like Bondurant. He says that puts a heavy burden on ranchers.
“They try to avoid conflicts,” he says. “They have herders, they have riders, they have calving in fenced areas, they use guard dogs for sheep.”
But when the Dell Creek wolves still killed over ten cattle, Jimenez says, the Fish and Wildlife Service was forced to use aerial gunning, shooting them from a plane until they stopped preying on cattle.
“We removed nine of 16 animals,” he says. “The pack has since moved. They do have a den, they do have pups. And there's now probably around six or seven wolves. They've moved away from the livestock and that's worked really well.”
Wyoming Game and Fish Chief Game Warden Brian Nesvik says when the state managed wolves, this kind of thing rarely happened.
“During the time when we had authority, there were fewer wolves that were shot out of helicopters or airplanes.”
Nesvik says wolves also didn't bother cattle as much around Bondurant. He says the public outcry over the killing of the Dell Creek wolves shows how divided people still are over wolves.
“I honestly believe that the best way to get folks to embrace wolf populations being on the landscape is through state management,” he says. “Federal management does not perpetuate a feeling of ownership in this species, it just doesn't.”
And state management does seem to be working in Montana and Idaho where wolves were delisted by Congress in 2011. Populations in those states are even higher than Wyoming's, even with legal trophy hunting.
But Tim Preso, an attorney with Earthjustice, an environmental group that fought to get Wyoming's wolves relisted, says the difference between Wyoming and those other states is Wyoming's management plan, “which has this widespread predator zone with unlimited killing,” he explains.
Preso says in Wyoming's plan, wolves only get trophy animal status in the northwest corner of the state, which means stronger protections and limited hunting. In the other 85 percent of the state, they were classified as predators like coyotes and could be killed on sight.
“I mean, the United States didn't spend millions of dollars to recover wolves just so they could all be shot again.”
The debate over Wyoming's approach to managing wolves is still tangled up in courts. Because of that, there doesn't appear to be a clear path to delisting wolves anytime soon. In the meantime, the wolf populations in Wyoming continue to move south.
Riding back along the creek, Rancher Steve Robertson brings his horse up short and points. Three grey-white wolves flash in the red willows and then dart up a steep hill. They stop once to look back, and then they're gone. We sit on our horses watching a long time. Even though it means a greater threat to his cattle, Robertson says it's still always fun to spot wolves.
Since early July, Hawai‘i Wildlife Fund and volunteers have been working to fill a 40-foot Matson container with blue and white plastic for Jason Klimoski and Lesley Chang of StudioKCA in Brooklyn, New York.
The couple plans to build a 30-foot. blue whale sculpture made entirely out of the collected plastic marine debris.
The whale sculpture will be installed as part of a triennial event in the town of Bruges, Belgium, in May 2018.
“The Bruges Whale is meant to spark conversation and raise awareness about the tremendous amount of plastic waste that is ending up in our oceans, hopefully helping the nearly 2,000,000 anticipated visitors reconsider what and how we consume, package, and dispose of plastic,” said Klimoski. “Special thanks to Hawai‘i Wildlife Fund for their tremendous effort over the course of the last several months, helping us collect blue, white and grey plastic to build Skyscraper, or ‘the Bruges Whale for the 2018 Bruges Triennial.”
In total, 17 Hawai‘i Island cleanup events were coordinated by HWF to fill the shipping container with approximately 19,212 of plastics while it was stationed at the Wai‘ōhinu Transfer Station in Ka‘ū.
Additionally, Surfrider Foundation volunteers on Kaua‘i collected 4,000 pounds of plastic debris that were added to the container once it reached Hilo, courtesy of a Young Brothers gratis-shipping grant that was received by HWF.
Matson Navigation was another supporter of the project by extending the time allowed to fill the container for free. Kona Trans also provided StudioKCA with a discounted hauling rate for the project and the County of Hawai‘i's Department of Environmental Management provided HWF space to store the 40 ft. container for 12 weeks as volunteers contributed to fill it with plastic debris, making this effort an especially collaborative project by local businesses and residents alike.
ADVERTISEMENT
The container will ship all 9.5 tons of marine-debris plastics from Hawai'i Island and Kaua‘i to Brooklyn from the port of Hilo on Wednesday Oct. 4, 2017. The material will later be shipped to Belgium.
“We are thrilled to be able to work with artists to create awareness installations, like this Blue Whale project, and simultaneously divert some of this plastic pollution from our island landfills,” said Megan Lamson, HWF Hawai'i Island program director. “Since 2003, HWF and volunteers have removed nearly 225 tons of debris from the shores of Hawai'i Island. Whatever cannot be recycled, generally ends up in landfills. Innovative projects that include reuse, art, research and recycling are always preferred!”
HWF is a small nonprofit conservation organization founded in 1996 to conserve native wildlife. During its 21-year existence, HWF and volunteers have removed a total of 260 tons of marine debris from the shores of Hawai'i Island (86% by weight), Maui, Midway and the French Frigate Shoals.
In 2017 alone, HWF and volunteers have removed 63,343 pounds of marine debris from Hawai'i Island and Maui during 51 community cleanup events. The majority of HWF's marine debris removal work is conducted by volunteer labor, with financial support from the federal government (NOAA's Marine Debris Program), local businesses (Matson Navigation, Kona Surf Film Festival, Kona Brewers Festival, Norwex, etc.), and individual donations from around the world.

I've been using tmux for about six months now and it has become just as essential to my workflow as vim. Pane and window management, copy-mode for navigating output, and session management make it a no-brainer for those who live in the terminal (and especially vim). I've compiled a list of tmux commands I use daily to help me work more efficiently.
If a tmux command I mention is bound to a keyboard shortcut by default, I'll note that in parenthesis.
They're accessed by entering a key combination called the prefix and then typing a letter.
For example, if you see prefix + d below, that means you would first hit (and release) Control + b and then type d .
The prefix can also be changed, which I'll show you how to do later.
Sessions are useful for completely separating work environments. I have a ‘Work' session and a ‘Play' session; in ‘Work', I keep everything open that I need during my day-to-day development, while in ‘Play', I keep open current open-source gems or other work I hack on at home.
tmux new -s session_name creates a new tmux session named session_name tmux attach -t session_name attaches to an existing tmux session named session_name tmux switch -t session_name switches to an existing session named session_name tmux list-sessions lists existing tmux sessions tmux detach (prefix + d) detach the currently attached session
tmux has a tabbed interface, but it calls its tabs “Windows”. To stay organized, I rename all the windows I use; if I'm hacking on a gem, I'll name the window that gem's name. The same thing goes for client applications. That way, I can recognize windows by context and not what application it's running.
tmux new-window (prefix + c) create a new window tmux select-window -t :0-9 (prefix + 0-9) move to the window based on index tmux rename-window (prefix + ,) rename the current window
Panes take my development time from bland to awesome. They're the reason I was able to uninstall MacVim and develop solely in iTerm2. I don't have to switch applications to switch contexts (editing, reading logs, IRB, etc.) - everything I do, I do in a terminal now. People argue that OS X's Cmd+Tab is just as fast, but I don't think so.
tmux split-window (prefix + ") splits the window into two vertical panes tmux split-window -h (prefix + %) splits the window into two horizontal panes tmux swap-pane -[UDLR] (prefix + { or }) swaps pane with another in the specified direction tmux select-pane -[UDLR] selects the next pane in the specified direction tmux select-pane -t :.+ selects the next pane in numerical order
tmux list-keys lists out every bound key and the tmux command it runs tmux list-commands lists out every tmux command and its arguments tmux info lists out every session, window, pane, its pid, etc. tmux source-file ~/.tmux.conf reloads the current tmux configuration (based on a default tmux config)
These are some of my must-haves in my tmux config:
# remap prefix to Control + a set -g prefix C-a unbind C-b bind C-a send-prefix # force a reload of the config file unbind r bind r source-file ~/.tmux.conf # quick pane cycling unbind ^A bind ^A select-pane -t :.+
During the day, I'll work on one or two Rails apps, work on my dotfiles, run irssi, and maybe run vim in another window to take notes for myself. As I mentioned, I run all of this inside one tmux session (named work) and switch between the different windows throughout the day.
When I'm working on any Ruby work specifically, I'll have a 75%/25% vertical split for vim and a terminal so I can run tests, interact with git, and code. If I run tests or git diff and want to see more output than the 25% allots me, I'll use tmux to swap the panes and then move into copy mode to see whatever I need to see.
Finally, I run iTerm2 in full-screen mode. Switching between OS X apps for an editor and a terminal is for chumps!

More than a million people with interest-only mortgages face a financial crunch when they have to pay them off, a watchdog is warning.
Some 2.6 million UK householders have the mortgages but the Financial Conduct Authority said estimates suggested that nearly half would not have savings or other funds to cover the final bill.
The average shortfall is £71,000, according to FCA research.
Lenders will now step up warnings to homeowners to prevent payment shocks.
Mortgage timebomb
Homeowners with these types of mortgage - about a third of all UK mortgage holders - make repayments each month that just cover the interest on the amount borrowed.
The full amount of the home loan should be paid back when the mortgage term matures - usually after 25 years - using funds such as savings, inheritance or from the sale of a business.
These mortgages were popular when sold alongside an endowment policy in the 1990s, and again during the last decade when many homeowners banked on the rising value of their home to cover the cost.

'Pressure' facing mortgage holders Rob McGregor, 42, from Reading, pays more than £900 a month and will still have £188,000 to pay off at the end of the mortgage term in 18 years. He already needed to make repayments on other loans and said that an interest-only mortgage seemed like the best option. "I needed a mortgage that I could pay less into each month. But now I regret choosing interest-only," he said. "It can be quite upsetting." He said it was a struggle to make ends meet. The financial pressure means he has to look for deals in supermarkets, and he is finding it difficult to set money aside in savings.
This led to fears of a mortgage timebomb, which prompted the agreement of new rules to tighten up on the sale of these mortgages from April 2014.
'Regret'
The FCA, the successor of the Financial Services Authority as the sector's watchdog, commissioned research to give a clear indication of what borrowers face when mortgages mature between now and 2041.
Market research firm GfK NOP questioned 1,103 interest-only borrowers to consider how prepared they were to repay their loans.
It also created a balance sheet for each respondent, looking at their financial position now and at the time their mortgage matures
It found that 37% of interest-only mortgage holders said they faced a shortfall in their plans to pay back the lump sum of the home loan, based on their own sums.
This included people like Rob McGregor who said that taking out such a mortgage seemed a good idea at the time, but was now something he regretted.
"It is a pressure. It can be quite upsetting sometimes when you look at your finances and think I have this huge debt hanging over me all the time," the 42-year-old said.
While many people realise they might have a problem paying back the home loan when the time comes, others are more oblivious of the issue.
The FCA says estimates "suggest" many people underestimated the financial problem and it believes 48% of holders of such mortgages face a shortfall.
Who is affected and when? People approaching retirement who took out endowment policies in the 1990s and 2000s. Typically they have high incomes and live in the South East or South West of England. The peak in policies maturing is in 2017-18
Less affluent, middle-aged homeowners who often converted to interest-only in 2003-09. Concentrated in the South West, East and North West of England, as well as London and the West Midlands. Maturity peaks in 2027-28
People who are highly indebted and opened mortgages in 2005-08. Maturity of these home loans peaks in 2032 'My 25 years of worry'
This could mean some are not likely to receive all the savings income or inheritance that they might expect.
More critically, one in 10 - the equivalent of 260,000 people - have no repayment strategy in place at all. They face the prospect of having to sell their homes when their mortgage matures.
'Help available'
The watchdog said that those facing a shortfall, even if their final bill is looming within the next 10 years, should be able to find a viable way to pay the home loan back.
Martin Wheatley, chief executive of the FCA, told the BBC that many of the mortgages were taken out before the financial crash, "when there was a lot of optimism about rising house prices and wages".
He said that there was no evidence people misunderstood the sort of mortgage liabilities they were taking on. "It's just that people were optimistic about the future," he said. "My advice to borrowers is not to bury their head in the sand. This report is a call to action."
Mortgage lenders have agreed to write to borrowers to ensure they have a repayment strategy in place, concentrating on those whose policies mature first.
"Anyone with an interest-only mortgage maturing before the end of 2020 should expect to be contacted over the course of the next 12 months by their lender," said Paul Smee, director general of the Council of Mortgage Lenders.
"The aim is not to force customers to take actions they do not wish to, but to ensure they are aware of their mortgage repayment position, and have an opportunity to take steps that may prove useful to them in avoiding unforeseen payment shocks later."
Paul Broadhead, of the Building Societies Association (BSA), said that this type of mortgage had worked well for many people, but help was available for those who found themselves in trouble.
"Building societies and other mutual lenders will deploy all the tools they have to help anyone who has an interest-only mortgage with a shortfall. This will only work if people respond to the communications they receive and engage early with their lender," he said.
But the consumer group Which? said that it was vital that people trapped in their current mortgage deals were treated fairly by their lenders.
THE Labour Party has agreed to split its headquarters straight down the middle after watching a classic 1972 episode of Steptoe and Son.
The HQ will now see the Pro-Corbyn side getting access to the part of the kitchen that has the kettle but not the sink and access to the toilet but not the shower.
A senior Labour insider said: “How are Jeremy Corbyn and Tom Watson going to be able to watch a football match with only half the TV each?
“They even look a bit like them, in a ‘not really but kind of' way.”
The source added: “We're going to have to get an extra letter box put on the front door, but it's a small price to pay really.”
The party has also used the name of the episode, ‘Divided We Stand' as its campaign slogan for the next general election.

Alex Gourevitch's brief piece on Syria concludes with the following statement:
And in the end, this is a thin humanitarianism, since one never finds the humanitarian militarists arguing the true humanitarian case: not bombs but open borders. Let in anyone who wishes to escape.
Rather than bombing the Assad regime, Gourevitch says, let the Syrian refugees into the United States. What's being advocated here is clear: no to empire, yes to refugees. Needless to say, I too subscribe to that notion and am against US imperial intervention.
But I fear that these two positions are just not enough. On their own, they constitute an impoverished politics.
In order to explain why, let's briefly apply the same principles to the Palestinian-Israeli conflict. When Israel brutally kills Palestinians, as it regularly does, do progressives in America only say “let those Palestinian refugees who manage to escape come to the US”? Absolutely not. Because they know that this would just aid Israel's colonial designs and invite Israel to continue behaving with impunity in the region.
Progressives stand in solidarity with the Palestinians, call for an end to Israel's bombings, and demand that Israel be prosecuted for crimes against humanity. They also push their own imperial state to stop all military aid for Israel, stop feeding Israel's colonial appetite, and stop shielding it from international justice.
Why is the Syrian case so different? The reality is that the Syrian catastrophe is even more acute. With half a million dead and millions displaced, the scale of the Syrian carnage is vast. Assad's dictatorship would rather kill, besiege, and starve the population than allow them dignity and democracy. Either live in humiliation and servitude, leave, or die. No people should have to accept these miserable options.
Yet some American progressives haven't afforded the Syrian people what they have so admirably afforded the Palestinians. Why is there no clear condemnation of Russian and Iranian intervention in Syria, without which the Assad government would have collapsed? Why was there no mention of the fact that Washington blocked Syrian opposition access to anti-aircraft weaponry, without which the regime was free to rain bombs on them?
US progressives cannot keep ignoring the fact that the Syrian people's cause is just and that their right to freedom is as important as anyone else's. We need to address the root cause of the refugee crisis and formulate a genuinely internationalist response to the Syrian catastrophe.
Being contra-empire and pro-refugee is not enough. It is simply unacceptable to stand by and see a brutal regime like Assad's get away with emptying Syria of its own people. Syrians have a right both to live and to live freely in their homeland. No regime should be allowed to massacre its own people or force them into a life of permanent exile and displacement.
If the answer to Israel's colonial persecution and dispossession of Palestinians is to help Palestinians stay in their homeland and fight for their rights, then the same solidarity principle should apply to Syrians.
Do open your borders to the wretched of the earth, but also stand in solidarity with the fight for their rights in their homeland.
There was once a time — before the investigations, before the sexual abuse conviction — when rich and famous men loved to hang around with Jeffrey Epstein, a billionaire money manager who loved to party.
They visited his mansion in Palm Beach, Fla. They flew on his jet to join him at his private estate on the Caribbean island of Little Saint James. They even joked about his taste in younger women.
President Trump called Epstein a “terrific guy” back in 2002, saying that “he's a lot of fun to be with. It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side.”
Now, Trump is on the witness list in a Florida court battle over how federal prosecutors handled allegations that Epstein, 64, sexually abused more than 40 minor girls, most of them between the ages of 13 and 17. The lawsuit questions why Trump's nominee for labor secretary, former Miami U.S. attorney Alexander Acosta, whose Senate confirmation hearing began Wednesday morning, cut a non-prosecution deal with Epstein a decade ago rather than pursuing a federal indictment that Acosta's staff had advocated.
[Read the non-prosecution deal Acosta made with Epstein]
(Thomas Johnson/The Washington Post)
Although Epstein's friends and visitors once included past and future presidents, rock stars, and some of the country's richest men, he is no longer a social magnet. Epstein pleaded guilty to a Florida state charge of felony solicitation of underage girls in 2008 and served a 13-month jail sentence. Politicians who had accepted his donations, including former New Mexico governor Bill Richardson and former New York governor Eliot Spitzer, have scurried to give them back. (Harvard University kept a $6.5 million gift, saying it was “funding important research” in mathematics.)
But Epstein's unusually light punishment — he was facing up to a life sentence had he been convicted on federal charges — has raised questions about how Acosta handled the case.
Former Palm Beach police chief Michael Reiter, whose department conducted the initial investigation into Epstein's behavior, said in a civil lawsuit deposition that Epstein got off easy.
“That wasn't an appropriate resolution of this matter,” Reiter said, arguing that the charges leveled against Epstein were “very minor,” compared with what the facts called for. In a letter to parents of Epstein's victims, Reiter said justice had not been served.
Prosecutors in Acosta's Miami office who had joined the FBI in the investigation concluded, according to documents produced by the U.S. attorney's office, that Epstein, working through several female assistants, “would recruit underage females to travel to his home in Palm Beach to engage in lewd conduct in exchange for money … Some went there as much as 100 times or more. Some of the women's conduct was limited to performing a topless or nude massage while Mr. Epstein masturbated himself. For other women, the conduct escalated to full sexual intercourse.”
Epstein has a near-legendary reputation in New York financial circles as a money manager who made many millions for his clients. Although he never graduated from college, he taught advanced math at the Dalton School, one of the city's top private schools, and went on to be a successful trader at Bear Stearns before starting his own firm, J. Epstein& Co., which managed the finances of clients who had a minimum of $1 billion in assets.
Federal prosecutors detailed their findings in an 82-page prosecution memo and a 53-page indictment, but Epstein was never indicted. In 2007, Acosta signed a non-prosecution deal in which he agreed not to pursue federal charges against Epstein or four women who the government said procured girls for him. In exchange, Epstein agreed to plead guilty to a solicitation charge in state court, accept a 13-month sentence, register as a sex offender and pay restitution to the victims identified in the federal investigation.
“This agreement will not be made part of any public record,” the deal between Epstein and Acosta says. The document was unsealed by a federal judge in a civil lawsuit in 2015.
Reiter said in the 2009 deposition that federal prosecutors in Miami told him “that typically these kinds of cases with one victim would end up in a ten-year sentence.” Reiter said he was surprised not only by the decision to pull back from prosecuting the case, but also by the light sentence and liberal privileges granted to Epstein during his jail term.
During Wednesday's confirmation hearing Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.) pressed Acosta about the plea agreement reached with Epstein.
Acosta told the committee that the case started at the state level before the Department of Justice decided to get involved. He said the original charge debated would not have led to any jail time and that “based on the evidence,” prosecutors decided to go with a deal where Epstein would have to register as a sex offender and agree to a two-year prison sentence.
His testimony Wednesday reflected Acosta's explanation of his decision in a “To whom it may concern” letter that he released to news organizations three years after the decision: “The bottom line is this: Mr. Jeffrey Epstein, a billionaire, served time in jail and is now a registered sex offender. He has been required to pay his victims restitution, though restitution clearly cannot compensate for the crime.” Acosta wrote that the case against Epstein grew stronger over the years because more victims spoke out after Epstein was convicted.
Acosta is Trump's second nominee to be secretary of labor; the first, Andrew Puzder, withdrew last month after Senate Republicans questioned his past employment of an undocumented housekeeper. Support for Acosta seems strong, as some Democrats and union leaders have joined with Senate Republicans in praising the nominee, who has been confirmed for federal positions three times in the past.
In the 2011 letter explaining his decision in the Epstein case, Acosta said he backed off from pressing charges after “a year-long assault on the prosecution and the prosecutors” by “an army of legal superstars” who represented Epstein, including Harvard Law professor Alan Dershowitz; Kenneth Starr, who as independent counsel led the investigation that brought about President Bill Clinton's impeachment; and some of the nation's most prominent defense attorneys, such as Roy Black, Gerald Lefcourt and Jay Lefkowitz.
“The defense strategy was not limited to legal issues,” Acosta wrote. “Defense counsel investigated individual prosecutors and their families, looking for personal peccadilloes that may provide a basis for disqualification.”
Dershowitz said in an interview that no such effort to rattle the prosecutors ever took place. “That's just dead wrong,” he said. “I would never participate in anything of that kind. Of course we investigated the witnesses but not Acosta's deputies. That's absurd.”
Acosta's “intention was to indict, and he fought hard and tried to get the best deal he could,” Dershowitz said. “We outlawyered him.” Epstein did not return a call seeking comment.
Conchita Sarnoff, the author of “TrafficKing,” a book on the Epstein case, said in an interview that Acosta told her a few years after his decision not to prosecute that “he felt incapable of going up against those eight powerful attorneys. He felt his career was at stake.”
In his letter about the decision, Acosta, who has been dean of the law school at Florida International University since 2009, acknowledged that “some prosecutors felt that we should just go to trial, and at times I felt that frustration myself.” He also complained that Epstein “received highly unusual treatment while in jail,” including being allowed to serve much of his sentence in the county jail rather than a state prison, and being permitted to leave the jail six days a week to work at home before returning to jail to sleep.
“The treatment that he received while in state custody undermined the purpose of a jail sentence,” Acosta said.
Dershowitz said Acosta “was very anxious to prosecute” Epstein, but “we persuaded them that they didn't have enough evidence of interstate transportation” of the underage girls to warrant federal charges.
But Reiter, the former police chief, said the FBI had evidence “from flight logs or something” that an underage victim “was transported on an aircraft of Mr. Epstein.”
“Some may feel that the prosecution should have been tougher,” Acosta wrote. “Evidence that has come to light since 2007 may encourage that view.” But the prosecutor argued that his office's investigation allowed state prosecutors to strengthen their charges against Epstein. And Acosta said that those who disagree with his decision “are not the ones who at the time reviewed the evidence available for trial and assessed the likelihood of success.”
The deal Acosta made with Epstein precluded any new federal prosecution based on offenses he may have committed between 2001 and 2007, but in Florida, Trump is on the witness list in a civil case in which two attorneys accuse federal prosecutors of having deceived Epstein's victims by failing to inform them that they would not charge Epstein.
Lawyers for the women argue that they had a right under the federal Crime Victims' Rights Act to know about Acosta's deal with Epstein. They say Acosta sought to keep the deal under wraps to avoid “the intense public criticism that would have resulted from allowing a politically-connected billionaire” to escape from federal prosecution.
Although Trump and Bill Clinton flew on Epstein's plane and visited his homes, neither president has been accused of taking part in the sexual misdeeds. But lawyers for Epstein's victims say Trump nonetheless may have useful information. Trump banned Epstein from his Mar-a-Lago Club in Palm Beach “because Epstein sexually assaulted an underage girl at the club,” Bradley Edwards, an attorney who represents three of the young women, said in court documents.
Lawyers involved with the various Epstein cases said there is virtually no chance that the president will be required to testify in a matter in which both sides agree his involvement was tangential.
Trump and Clinton are both among the dozens of names that appeared in a “black book” of Epstein's phone contacts that his houseman, Alfredo Rodriguez, obtained. Rodriguez, who died in 2015, was convicted of obstruction of justice in 2010 after he tried to sell the book for $50,000 to lawyers representing Epstein's victims. In the book, Rodriguez circled the names of contacts he said were involved in sexual misbehavior at Epstein's properties. There were no circles around the names of Trump, Clinton or other boldfaced names such as former Israeli prime minister Ehud Barak, former British prime minister Tony Blair, and celebrities Mick Jagger, Michael Jackson, David Frost and Jimmy Buffett.
Rodriguez spent 18 months in prison, five months longer than Epstein served in jail.
Epstein has continued to move among his homes in New York City, where he owns one of the largest private residences in Manhattan, Palm Beach and the Caribbean.
CALGARY — A bid by a group of First Nations to have well−known places across southern Alberta, including Calgary, renamed in their language is being challenged by the chief of another Indigenous community.
The Stoney Nakoda have applied to the Alberta government to change the names of Calgary and dozens other sites that they consider to be part of their territory.
They wrote in a letter that they are the original occupants of the land and that a lack of recognition increases the threat to the Stoney Nakoda's heritage.
But Chief Stanley Grier of the Piikani Nation says the cultural, historic and archaeological record contradicts the Stoney Nakoda's claim to be the area's original occupants.

The Piikani Nation 200 kilometres south of Calgary is part of the Blackfoot Confederacy, which also includes the Siksika Nation and the Kainai First Nation.
Grier says in a letter to Calgary's mayor and to the co−ordinator of the Alberta Geographical Names Program that the Blackfoot people have lived in the area since time immemorial.
“For us, in this region, such a period is over 6,000 years ago, for what we retain in narrative, in ceremony, and song, remains in rock, upon stone, fashioned into projectiles and layers of buffalo bones,” Grier wrote to Naheed Nenshi and Ron Kelland.
The Stoney Nations, descendents of the Sioux, include three bands with the largest reserve west of Calgary. In their letter, they said they wanted Calgary to be renamed Wichispa Oyade, which roughly translates to elbow town.
Two rivers flow through Calgary, the Bow and the smaller Elbow.
Grier said his Blackfoot ancestors thousands of years ago called the place Mohkinstsiss — a reference to how “a great bend, the Elbow, came to be in The River Where the Bow Reeds Grow.”
“While contemporary economic realities and logistics would seem to make the prospects of renaming Calgary remote, adding the name most used by the First Nations now connected to the area would be a viable and positive step.”
He said there is little contention that Head−Smashed−In Buffalo Jump has been embraced by the Blackfoot for over 5,000 years and sacred imagery at Writing−On−Stone Provincial Park pre−dates that.
“The record reflects that the Stoney entered the region westward along the Saskatchewan River, where they will likely have found more circles of stone laid by our people near the forks of the Saskatchewan and Red Deer Rivers, one dated at 1,900 years old,” Grier wrote.
“The economics of trade and relations with the Northwest Co. and (the Hudson's Bay Company) were primary motivating factors in Stoney movements.”
Lauren Krugel, The Canadian Press
Journalist and author Peter Hitchens has been exposing the hypocrisy and cant of “posturing notables” regarding the refugee crisis. In most recent column for the Mail on Sunday he warns against the fundamental transformation of Britain sought by those seeking to welcome all migrants.
He opens by explaining that having inherited Britain from others, “we have a duty to hand it on to our children and grandchildren, preferably improved and certainly undamaged.” He describes this as “one of the heaviest responsibilities we will ever have,” advising that we cannot just give it away on impulse in the face of the refugee crisis to make us “feel good about ourselves.”
Typically, he does not just leave the matter there. He calls out those whose response to the refugee crisis is to make grand gestures of support with little to back them up – or “compassion signalling” as Breitbart London‘s James Delingpole described it earlier this week. He writes:
“Every one of the posturing notables simpering ‘refugees welcome' [such as comedian Rufus Hound pictured above] should be asked if he or she will take a refugee family into his or her home for an indefinite period, and pay for their food, medical treatment and education. “If so, they mean it. If not, they are merely demanding that others pay and make room so that they can experience a self-righteous glow. No doubt the same people are also sentimental enthusiasts for the ‘living wage', and ‘social housing', when in fact open borders are steadily pushing wages down and housing costs up. “As William Blake rightly said: ‘He who would do good to another must do it in minute particulars. General good is the plea of the scoundrel, hypocrite and flatterer.'”
Hitchens goes on to credit Britain being an island state for the reason it is a desirable place to live pointing out “most of the really successful civilisations survived because they were protected from invasion by mountains, sea, deserts or a combination of these things.” He notes this has led to the development of “astonishing levels of trust, safety and freedom” in Britain which, albeit to a lesser extent, can also be seen in the Anglosphere countries of the USA, Canada, Australia and New Zealand.
He is, therefore, all the more amazed at the willingness of some to give all that away. He writes:
“Our advantages depend very much on our shared past, our inherited traditions, habits and memories. Newcomers can learn them, but only if they come in small enough numbers. Mass immigration means we adapt to them, when they should be adapting to us. “So now, on the basis of an emotional spasm, dressed up as civilisation and generosity, are we going to say that we abandon this legacy and decline our obligation to pass it on, like the enfeebled, wastrel heirs of an ancient inheritance letting the great house and the estate go to ruin?”
Hitchens also writes about the major turning point of the refugee crisis, the publication this week of the photograph of 3-year-old Aylan Kurdi's drowned body lying on a beach. In doing so he rejects the viewpoint of many of his colleagues in the mainstream media, writing:
“Having seen more than my share of real corpses, and watched children starving to death in a Somali famine, I am not unmoved by pictures of a dead child on a Turkish beach. But I am not going to pretend to be more upset than anyone else. Nor am I going to suddenly stop thinking, as so many people in the media and politics appear to have done. “The child is not dead because advanced countries have immigration laws. The child is dead because criminal traffickers cynically risked the lives of their victims in pursuit of money. “I'll go further. The use of words such as ‘desperate' is quite wrong in this case. The child's family were safe in Turkey. Turkey (for all its many faults) is a member of Nato, officially classified as free and democratic. Many British people actually pay good money to go on holiday to the very beach where the child's body was washed up. “It may not be ideal, but the definition of a refugee is that he is fleeing from danger, not fleeing towards a higher standard of living.”
He goes on to explain that he has always vocally opposed the armed interventions by the West in Syria and Libya, but sees “neither sense nor justice in allowing these things to become a pretext for an unstoppable demographic revolution in which Europe (including, alas, our islands) merges its culture and its economy with North Africa and the Middle East.” There, Hitchens predicts, lies the loss of all that actually makes others want to live here.
After questioning the veracity of the migrants (“You really think these crowds of tough young men chanting ‘Germany!' in the heart of Budapest are ‘asylum-seekers' or ‘refugees'?”) he concludes pessimistically:
“Can we stop this transformation of all we have and are? I doubt it. To do so would involve the grim-faced determination of Australia, making it plain in every way that our doors are open only to limited numbers of people, chosen by us, enduring the righteous scorn of the supposedly enlightened. “As we lack the survival instinct and the determination necessary, and as so many of our most influential people are set on committing a sentimental national suicide, I suspect we won't. “To those who condemn reasonable calls for national self-defence as bigotry, hatred and intolerance (which they are not), I make only this request: just don't pretend you're doing a good and generous thing, when you're really cowardly and weak.”

False Statements Regarding FLYNN's Request to the Russian Ambassador that Russia Refrain from Escalating the Situation in Response to U.S. Sanctions against Russia
2. FLYNN's false statements and omissions impeded and otherwise had a material impact on the FBI's ongoing investigation into the existence of any links or coordination between individuals associated with the Campaign and Russia's efforts to interfere with the 2016 presidential election.
1. The defendant, MICHAEL T. FLYNN, who served as a surrogate and national security advisor for the presidential campaign of Donald J. Trump ("Campaign"), as a senior member of President-Elect Trump's Transition Team ("Presidential Transition Team"), and as the National Security Advisor to President Trump, made materially false statements and omissions during an interview with the Federal Bureau of Investigation ("FBI") on January 24, 2017, in Washington, D.C. At the time of the interview, the FBI had an open investigation into the Government of Russia's ("Russia") efforts to interfere in the 2016 presidential election, including the nature of any links between individuals associated with the Campaign and Russia, and whether there was any coordination between the Campaign and Russia's efforts.
Pursuant to Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 11, the United States of America and the defendant, MICHAEL T. FLYNN, stipulate and agree that the following facts are true and accurate. These facts do not constitute all of the facts known to the parties concerning the charged offense; they are being submitted to demonstrate that sufficient facts exist that the defendant committed the offense to which he is pleading guilty.
Here are the key details for you to judge for yourself:
The news of Mike Flynn's plea agreement with special prosecutor Robert Mueller was trumpeted on the media as if Flynn had admitted to killing Kennedy or had unprotected sex with Vladimir Putin. But once I took time to read the actual agreement I realized, not surprisingly, the the media lynch mob was blinded by hatred and unwilling to think objectively or fairly about the matter. The evidence exonerates Donald Trump of having colluded with the Russians but does expose Michael Flynn as a man of terrible judgment when it comes to talking to the FBI. There was nothing that Flynn did with the Russians that was wrong or improper.
3. On or about January 24, 2017, FLYNN agreed to be interviewed by agents from the FBI ("January 24 voluntary interview"). During the interview, FLYNN falsely stated that he did not ask Russia's Ambassador to the United States ("Russian Ambassador") to refrain from escalating the situation in response to sanctions that the United States had imposed against Russia. FLYNN also falsely stated that he did not remember a follow-up conversation in which the Russian Ambassador stated that Russia had chosen to moderate its response to those sanctions as a result of FLYNN's request. In truth and in fact, however, FLYNN then and there knew that the following had occurred:
a. On or about December 28, 2016, then-President Barack Obama signed Executive Order 13757, which was to take effect the following day. The executive order announced sanctions against Russia in response to that government's actions intended to interfere with the 2016 presidential election ("U.S. Sanctions").
b. On or about December 28, 2016, the Russian Ambassador contacted FLYNN,
c. On or about December 29, 2016, FLYNN called a senior official of the Presidential Transition Team ("PTT official"), who was with other senior members of the Presidential Transition Team at the Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach, Florida, to discuss what, if anything, to communicate to the Russian Ambassador about the U.S. Sanctions. On that call, FLYNN and the PTT official discussed the U.S. Sanctions, including the potential impact of those sanctions on the incoming administration's foreign policy goals. The PTT official and FLYNN also discussed that the members of the Presidential Transition Team at Mar-a-Lago did not want Russia to escalate the situation.
d. Immediately after his phone call with the PTT official, FLYNN called the Russian Ambassador and requested that Russia not escalate the situation and only respond to the U.S. Sanctions in a reciprocal manner.
e. Shortly after his phone call with the Russian Ambassador, FLYNN spoke with the PTT official to report on the substance of his call with the Russian Ambassador, including their discussion of the U.S. Sanctions.
f. On or about December 30, 2016, Russian President Vladimir Putin released a statement indicating that Russia would not take retaliatory measures in response to the U.S. Sanctions at that time.
g. On or about December 31, 2016, the Russian Ambassador called FLYNN and informed him that Russia had chosen not to retaliate in response to FLYNN's request.
h. After his phone call with the Russian Ambassador, FLYNN spoke with senior members of the Presidential Transition Team about FLYNN's conversations with the Russian Ambassador regarding the U.S. Sanctions and Russia's decision not to escalate the situation.
False Statements Regarding FLYNN's Request that Foreign Officials Vote Against or Delay a United Nations Security Council Resolution
4. During the January 24 voluntary interview, FLYNN made additional false statements about calls he made to Russia and several other countries regarding a resolution submitted by Egypt to the United Nations Security Council on December 21, 2016. Specifically FLYNN falsely stated that he only asked the countries' positions on the vote, and that he did not request that any of the countries take any particular action on the resolution. FLYNN also falsely stated that the Russian Ambassador never described to him Russia's response to FLYNN's request regarding the resolution. In truth and in fact, however, FLYNN then and there knew that the following had occurred:
a. On or about December 21, 2016, Egypt submitted a resolution to the United Nations Security Council on the issue of Israeli settlements ("resolution"). The United Nations Security Council was scheduled to vote on the resolution the following day.
b. On or about December 22, 2016, a very senior member of the Presidential Transition Team directed FLYNN to contact officials from foreign governments, including Russia, to learn where each government stood on the resolution and to influence those governments to delay the vote or defeat the resolution.
c. On or about December 22, 2016, FLYNN contacted the Russian Ambassador about the pending vote. FLYNN informed the Russian Ambassador about the incoming administration's opposition to the resolution, and requested that Russia vote against or delay the resolution
d. On or about December 23, 2016, FLYNN again spoke with the Russian Ambassador, who informed FLYNN that if it came to a vote Russia would not vote against the resolution.
Other False Statements Regarding FLYNN's Contacts with Foreign Governments
5. On March 7, 2017, FLYNN filed multiple documents with the Department of Justice pursuant to the Foreign Agents Registration Act ("FARA") pertaining to a project performed by him and his company, the Flynn Intel Group, Inc. ("FIG"), for the principal benefit of the Republic of Turkey ("Turkey project"). In the FARA filings, FLYNN made materially false statements and omissions, including by falsely staling that (a) FIG did not know whether or the extent to which the Republic of Turkey was involved in the Turkey project, (b) the Turkey project was focused on improving U.S. business organizations' confidence regarding doing business in Turkey, and (c) an op-ed by FLYNN published in The Hill on November 8, 2016, was written at his own initiative; and by omitting that officials from the Republic of Turkey provided supervision and direction over the Turkey project.
Robert S. Mueller III
Special Counsel
Now, let's sort out what actually happened with respect to Russia (you can only figure this out after reading the entire charge). Let's re-write the Mueller "charge" chronologically and look at how the meaning changes:
December 21, 2016--Egypt submitted a resolution to the United Nations Security Council on the issue of Israeli settlements ("resolution").
December 22, 2016--a very senior member of the Presidential Transition Team (reportedly Jared Kushner) directed FLYNN to contact officials from foreign governments, including Russia, to learn where each government stood on the resolution and to influence those governments to delay the vote or defeat the resolution.
December 23, 2016--FLYNN again spoke with the Russian Ambassador, who informed FLYNN that if it came to a vote Russia would not vote against the resolution.
On this same day, President-elect Trump spoke with Egyptian leader Sisi, who agreed to withdraw the resolution (link).
[I would note that there is nothing illegal or wrong about any of this. Quite an appropriate action, in fact, for an incoming President. Moreover, if Trump and the Russians had been conspiring before the November election, why would Trump and team even need to persuade the Russian Ambassador to do the biding of Trump on this issue?]
December 28, 2016--President Barack Obama signed Executive Order 13757, which was to take effect the following day, imposing sanctions on Russia. Russian Ambassador Kislyak called General Flynn (who was vacationing in the Caribbean).
December 29, 2016, FLYNN called a senior official of the Presidential Transition Team ("PTT official"), who was with other senior members of the Presidential Transition Team at the Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach, Florida, to discuss what, if anything, to communicate to the Russian Ambassador about the U.S. Sanctions. On that call, FLYNN and the PTT official discussed the U.S. Sanctions, including the potential impact of those sanctions on the incoming administration's foreign policy goals. The PTT official and FLYNN also discussed that the members of the Presidential Transition Team at Mar-a-Lago did not want Russia to escalate the situation.
FLYNN called the Russian Ambassador and requested that Russia not escalate the situation and only respond to the U.S. Sanctions in a reciprocal manner.
Shortly after his phone call with the Russian Ambassador, FLYNN spoke with the PTT official to report on the substance of his call with the Russian Ambassador, including their discussion of the U.S. Sanctions.
December 31, 2016--the Russian Ambassador called FLYNN and informed him that Russia had chosen not to retaliate in response to FLYNN's request.
After his phone call with the Russian Ambassador, FLYNN spoke with senior members of the Presidential Transition Team about FLYNN's conversations with the Russian Ambassador regarding the U.S. Sanctions and Russia's decision not to escalate the situation.
The real crime of Michael Flynn was his lies about his work with Turkey under the auspices of the Flynn Intel Group. That was flat out wrong. Yet, that is ignored by the media. They want the Russia silver bullet.
Guess what? There ain't one.
Not one of the things outlined in the Mueller complaint was illegal nor immoral with respect to contacts with Russia. In fact, the sequence of events and Flynn's role provides direct evidence that the senior Trump team had no established contacts with Russia. If they did, why the hell did they rely on Flynn to persuade the Russian government to do or not do things if Trump and his family were already on the Kremlin hook? Makes no sense whatsoever.
I do not know why Flynn lied to the FBI. Shame on him for that. He has dishonored himself and the uniform he once wore.
We will find out in the coming days if Jared Kushner is as big a fool as Flynn. If JK told the FBI the truth about the events that unfolded between 21 and 31 December then he is off the hook. If he lied, he could be facing charges. One big difference, though. He can afford big time lawyers and beat the Mueller team to shit in the courtroom.

This story was an emotional rollercoaster of a ride. The memories shared, the fun times reminisced, looking back on their lives – it was all amazing and beautifully written with a certain passion too difficult to recreate.

Australians spend eight times more hours per week looking at screens than with loved ones: survey
Updated
Australians spend eight times as many hours per week looking at screens than with their loved ones, a new survey has found.
Respondents to the survey, conducted by R U OK?, said they spent an average of 46 hours a week looking at a screen, but just six hours with family and friends. Half of the respondents spent two hours or less with family and friends.
The suicide prevention charity surveyed 1,000 adults for the study.
Rachel Clements, a clinical psychologist on the charity's think tank panel said the trend could be damaging.
"It definitely has an impact on mental health, in terms of low mood, ability to get through difficult situations, having someone to talk to, to debrief with," Ms Clements said.
"Those types of relationships, if they're strong and they're around us, they're big protective factors in keeping us well.
"Staying connected to people, reaching out to people and having really good relationships is a really positive thing.
"When people are disconnected, when we pull away or withdraw from others, it means that if challenges or obstacles or difficult times come our way it can make those times a little tougher to get through."
Distance, feeling tired listed as the biggest obstacles
Distance was cited as the biggest obstacle to catching up with loved ones, with 38 per cent of respondents saying that was the reason for not spending more time with loved ones.
Feeling too tired was the reason given by 28 per cent, 20 per cent said they were too busy with other activities, 19 per cent said it was due to a need to catch up on housework and 18 per cent blamed long work hours.
Ms Clements said even though catching up with loved ones was not physically difficult, many Australians are time poor.
"We're busy, we're doing a lot more than we've ever done … [so] finding that time, or really making that time, falls off the radar a lot more easily."
She said Australians should think about how else they could use their screen time.
"It could be visiting people, just thinking about people that you haven't connected to in a long time.
"And maybe just swapping some of the time that you might spend with your screens, and devices, and TVs, into real-time relationships."
Personal connections 'worth the effort'
R U OK? Day on September 8 is designed to be a reminder to check in with family, friends and workmates with the goal of connecting people and protecting them from suicide.
The charity's ambassador and former rugby league player Brett Finch said he will be taking time to reconnect with his friends on R U OK? Day and throughout the year.
"It can be easy to lose contact with people who matter to us because life's hectic," Finch said.
"Even if you can't be there in person, pick up the phone and give someone you care about a call. It's worth the effort.
"Having been through some personal battles in recent years, I know how important it is that we've got good mates and family to talk to.
"I'm so grateful that my family and mates reached out to me when I was at my lowest point. I know the difference a sense of connection and support can make.
"That's why I want others to do the same for the people in their world."

Fantasy football is a fickle game. One season, you can have an incredible team, the next you're scrapping the bottom of the waiver wire to finagle a win. Regardless of stats, analysis, and expertise, conjecturing about player outcomes is tricky. I can safely say that anyone that has made fantasy predictions has been wrong at least a few times. That being said, believe that my list of wide receivers below will turn out to be fairly accurate.
All of these rankings are based on 10-person, standard scoring leagues.
Round 4: Allen Robinson
Allen Robinson had an underwhelming season last year (845 yards, 6 TDs), no denying that. However, I wouldn't count him out just yet. A-Rob has outstanding leaping abilities, is deceptively strong, and is tall. He's undoubtedly the best wide receiver on the Jags. Most fantasy players would feel apprehensive about this pick given Blake Bortles‘ regression last year. But I would argue that the Jaguars' offense just got a major relief in the addition of Leonard Fournette, a relief that will take some pressure off Bortles, which subsequently could give A-Rob more opportunities to snag his once very common long distance touchdown catches. If you're feeling bold, take this high risk, and who knows, it may yield a pretty darn high reward, maybe even another 1000+ yard double digit TDs reward. This first suggestion is for the more intrepid, courageous, or foolishly hopeful team manager.had an underwhelming season last year (845 yards, 6 TDs), no denying that.

Round 5: Tyreek Hill
Jeremy Maclin, it's likely that Hill will soak up more targets. Granted, Travis Kelce is likely to still draw most of the attention. However, I would argue that with another year to develop a rapport with Alex Smith and less competition at the receiver position, Hill is poised for a big sophomore year. Don't be surprised if finishes as a top-10 wide receiver in fantasy scoring. This selection is a no-brainer. Hill is a dynamic speedster that can get you points in a myriad of ways: touchdown receptions, runs out of the backfield, punt returns; he can do it all! Now that the Chiefs are without, it's likely that Hill will soak up more targets. Granted,is likely to still draw most of the attention. However, I would argue that with another year to develop a rapport withand less competition at the receiver position, Hill is poised for a big sophomore year. Don't be surprised if finishes as a top-10 wide receiver in fantasy scoring.
Round 6: Michael Crabtree
Michael Crabtree being ranked this low surprised me. Yes, Amari Cooper is a stud and led the Raiders in targets. But Crabtree is the much better bargain. The two wide receivers play on an explosive offense led by budding star Derek Carr. With Carr's pension for throwing the ball, Crabtree and Cooper both had great years in the previous season. Also, and most important to his case, Crabtree was targeted more in the end zone than Cooper, a fact that was reflected in their final fantasy point totals being much closer than you'd expect. He may be the number two on his team, but given the wealth of opportunities, Crabtree is a steal for the 6th round. being ranked this low surprised me. Yes,is a stud and led the Raiders in targets.

He may be the number two on his team, but given the wealth of opportunities, Crabtree is a steal for the 6th round.
Round 7: Julian Edelman
Brandin Cooks and the return of Gronk certainly place a question mark over Edelman's potential targets, and heck, even his overall role. However, let's consider a few facts. For starters, Gronk takes some serious shots from defenders, hits so severe, he's been injury prone for the past few years. If Gronk goes down, Edelman eats up those middle of the field targets. Also, let's not forget that Tom Brady and Edelman are best friends that have played together for awhile. I don't suspect Cooks is going to be able to establish a better connection with Brady in his first year. And of course, this is the Patriots we're talking about, they'll put up enough points for everyone to eat well. I was apprehensive while writing up this recommendation. I, like most NFL fans, don't doubt Edelman's skills, but there are a lot of factors to consider here.

Round 8: Willie Snead
Michael Thomas will definitely be Drew Brees‘ main receiver. But come on! Bree throws a billion yards every year (it's more like 5000+). There's no way Snead doesn't snag some of those numbers. And, although I think they will be an improvement, the running back tandem of Mark Ingram and Adrian Peterson isn't going to take away from Brees's need to air it out. Snead's role as the second wideout on a gunslinger's offense makes him a really valuable late-round flex pick. Another obvious selection, and perhaps one of the best late rounders that'll be available.will definitely be‘ main receiver. But come on!

Snead's role as the second wideout on a gunslinger's offense makes him a really valuable late-round flex pick.
Round 9: Jeremy Maclin
Joe Flacco was near the top of passes per game, which makes sense given that their running game is atrocious. Maclin is going to slide into an excellent role, one in which he can easily become the lead receiver for a quarterback that likes to throw bombs. His only competition is some aging wideouts and unproven young players. I would even go so far to argue that Maclin is going to be one of the best options Flacco has had in his entire career. Last year aside, Maclin has had multiple 1000+ yard seasons, and as long as he stays healthy, he'll replicate those numbers again. I can't believe Maclin's ADP is listed this low. I understand that he's coming off an injury ridden season, but it's not like he tore his ACL. In fact, Maclin was only released by Chiefs as a measure to save money, but I digress, let's examine his potential on the Ravens.was near the top of passes per game, which makes sense given that their running game is atrocious.

Last year aside, Maclin has had multiple 1000+ yard seasons, and as long as he stays healthy, he'll replicate those numbers again.
Round 10: DeSean Jackson
Mike Evans is still only one wide receiver. The young duo of Evans and Jameis Winston has gotten better every year since entering the league. Jackson adds two key components to this budding offense. For starters, he provides a veteran perspective for his young teammates. But more importantly, he gives Winston a quality second option if Evans is being blanketed. Jackson is still fast, has strong hands, and is tough. As with Maclin, if Jackson stays healthy, I think he's going to put solid stats for the Bucs. This is a gamble, but considering we're in the 10th round, you're not going to be waging too much. The Buccaneers have only one reliable target, granted, that one target is a superstar,is still only one wide receiver.

Round 11: Rishard Matthews
Debbie Wasserman Schultz has lawyered up and is going into hiding after reports are surfacing, linking her to a brutal murder. She went ballistic and threatened a Capitol Police Chief a few weeks ago after he refused to turn over her computer, which was seized from her IT tech, who is currently under arrest. Now, a veteran homicide detective has linked her to the horrendous murder of one of her staffers. This is no joke, and you don't want to miss it.
Debbie Wasserman Schultz is having an epic meltdown and is unreachable, only speaking through her legal team. She came under fire after her IT tech, Imran Awan, was caught fleeing the United States. What led up to that point is a very sordid situation that involves Wasserman Schultz, who was chairman of the Democratic National Committee, and those she hired, the three Awan brothers who were found to be stealing classified information from the DNC servers.
This all came to a head in July 2016, as the DNC held its convention to nominate Hillary Clinton. The big breaking story was that the DNC got hacked with unflattering leaks hitting the headlines, and it all pointed to Wasserman Schultz, who resigned in disgrace. Then, in February 2017, the Awan brothers story hit, and they were fired. They moved out of the home in Virginia immediately and rented it out to a Marine who stated he found smashed computers strewn around the place.
“[A] Marine Corps veteran married to a female Navy Officer — said he found ‘wireless routers, hard drives that look like they tried to destroy, laptops, [and] a lot of brands new expensive toner,'” reported The Daily Caller. The Capitol Police started an investigation, which caused Wasserman Schultz to threaten the Capitol Police Chief. Looking like a woman possessed, she told him that “there will be consequences” if her computers were not returned.
Obviously, she was intent on hiding whatever the Awan brothers were up to, and she even kept their ringleader, Imran Awan on her payroll after he was fired by the DNC, with Wasserman Schultz only firing him on Tuesday after he was arrested while trying to escape the U.S.
Now, we come to the bombshell accusation made by Detective Rod Wheeler. One thing must be clearly pointed out first; Wasserman Schultz, at this point, is involved in a cover-up for the Awan brothers. She is protecting Muslim men who hacked into the DNC server and obtained classified information from the Senate Intel Committee.
Rod Wheeler is a retired veteran homicide detective hired by the family of murdered DNC staffer Seth Rich, who was a subordinate of Debbie Wasserman Schultz at the time of his death. Wheeler has uncovered that, while the Awan brothers were hacking into the DNC servers, Rich was emailing WikiLeaks.
“Rod Wheeler, a private investigator hired by the Rich family, suggests there is tangible evidence on Rich's laptop that confirms he was communicating with WikiLeaks prior to his death,” reported Fox 5 News. Wheeler sent out two bombshell tweets yesterday, and he is inferring that Debbie Wasserman Schultz is the smoking gun linking Seth Rich's murder to the Awan brothers and the DNC. Even President Donald Trump re-tweeted an article about the Wasserman Schultz investigation.
Wasserman Schultz aide arrested trying to leave the country https://t.co/UypKvCbQfL via @politico — rod wheeler (@rodwheeler) July 26, 2017
Follow the arrest of Awan closely. Connect the dots to "other" cases. (hint, hint) Just the beginning. Stay tuned. — rod wheeler (@rodwheeler) July 26, 2017
Wheeler's first tweet at 4:32 am has a huge pic of Debbie Wasserman Schultz, and it's about her good buddy Imran Awan fleeing the country. His second tweet, only 15 minutes later, is telling us to follow the arrest of Awan and “connect the dots” to other cases. The dots include Wasserman Schultz, allegedly involved in a conspiracy with the DNC and Hillary Clinton to cover up the real hackers of the DNC, the Awan brothers who were paid 4 million dollars by the DNC, and the suspicious death of Seth Rich.
“I have a source inside the police department that has looked at me straight in the eye and said, ‘Rod, we were told to stand down on this case and I can't share any information with you.' Now, that is highly unusual for a murder investigation, especially from a police department. Again, I don't think it comes from the chief's office, but I do believe there is a correlation between the mayor's office and the DNC and that is the information that will come out soon,” said Wheeler back in May 2017.
It's looking like Wasserman Schultz is the linchpin linking Rich's murder, the DNC, Clinton campaign, and the Awan brothers. She's involved with all three as the former Chairman of the DNC. Her threatening behavior toward the Capitol Police Chief was bizarre, but now, it is making sense. Debbie Wasserman Schultz has now lawyered up and has gone into hiding, but hiding won't make Detective Wheeler or these incredible accusations go away.
.- On Thursday the Vatican announced Pope Francis' decision to nominate Archbishop Blase Cupich of Chicago as a new member of the Vatican's Congregation for Bishops.
The Pope's appointment of Archbishop Cupich to the Vatican department was announced in a July 7 communique from the Vatican.
The Congregation of Bishops, currently headed by Cardinal Marc Oullet, is responsible for what pertains to the “establishment and provision of particular Churches and to the exercise of the episcopal office in the Latin Church” – primarily, overseeing the process of selecting and appointing bishops.
Cupich's nomination to the congregation comes just two years after he was tapped to lead the Archdiocese of Chicago. He was appointed as Archbishop of Chicago by Pope Francis Sept. 20, 2015, replacing Cardinal Francis George.
He was also among the 45 bishops appointed by Pope Francis to participate in the 2015 Ordinary Synod of Bishops on the Family.
Born in Omaha, Neb. In 1949, he was ordained a priest in 1975 and studied at the College of St. Thomas in Minnesota as well as the Pontifical College of North America in Rome. In 1998, he was named bishop of Rapid City, South Dakota, and in 2010, he was named bishop of Spokane. He took over for Cardinal George in Chicago in 2014, due to the cardinal's failing health.
In December 2013, nine months after his election to the papacy, Pope Francis made significant changes in the congregation's membership, appointing several new members and confirming others in the roles they already held.
Among those appointed at that time was Cardinal Donald Wuerl of Washington, D.C., who also serves on several pontifical councils, as well as committees of U.S. bishops. He served as relator general for the October 2012 Vatican Synod of Bishops on the New Evangelization, and was also among those tapped by Francis to participate in the 2015 Synod of Bishops.
Other members of the Congregation appointed by Pope Francis in 2013 include: Cardinals Francisco Robles Ortega; Ruben Salazar Gomez; Kurt Koch; and João Braz de Aviz; as well as Archbishops Pietro Parolin; Beniamino Stella; Lorenzo Baldisseri; Vincent Nichols; Paolo Rabitti; and Bishop Felix Genn.
Those whose membership he confirmed were: Cardinals Tarcisio Bertone, Zenon Grocholewski, George Pell, Agostino Vallini, Antonio Cañizares Llovera, André Vingt-Trois, Jean-Louis Tauran, William Levada, prefect emeritus of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, Leonardo Sandri, Giovanni Lajolo, Stanislaw Rylko, Francesco Monterisi, Santos Abril y Castelló, Giuseppe Bertello, and Giuseppe Versaldi as well as Archbishops Claudio Maria Celli, José Octavio Ruiz Arenas and Zygmunt Zimowski.
Richard Nixon was one of the best-known American politicians of the 20th century's second half, and one of the most controversial. So how much do you know about the 37th President on the occasion of his birthday?
Nixon burst on to the political scene just after World War II, when he won seats in the United States House of Representatives and the Senate from California. His political career ended in August 1974, with his historic resignation during the Watergate scandal.
In between, Nixon became one of the most famous figures in the world and fixture in national politics. Here are a few things you may, or may not know, about his roller coaster career.
1. Nixon and Franklin Roosevelt are the only two people to appear on a national presidential ticket five times. Nixon won election in four of the five races, as did FDR. Nixon was the winning vice presidential candidate in 1952 and 1956, and he won the 1968 and 1972 presidential elections. Roosevelt won four presidential elections and lost as a vice presidential candidate in 1920.
2. Nixon had a chance to attend Harvard but had to decline. As a student, Richard Nixon was third in his class and was offered a tuition grant to Harvard, but he was needed at home by his family.
3. He was also an outstanding law student. After graduating from Whittier College in California, Nixon received a full scholarship to Duke Law and he graduated third in his class.
4. Nixon was a lieutenant commander in the Navy during World War II. He served in a variety of administrative positions, but didn't see combat during his time in the Pacific.
5. Richard Nixon almost became an FBI agent in the 1930s. Nixon applied to the agency but never heard back about his application. He has been accepted but then budget cuts eliminated his position.
6. Nixon was only 39 years old when he ran for vice president in 1952. Presidential candidate Dwight Eisenhower didn't have a preference for a running mate, and party leaders favor Nixon for his anti-Communist stance and his strength in California.
7. Nixon survived two potentially fatal political losses in 1960 and 1962. Defeats in the presidential campaign against John F. Kennedy and the 1962 Californian governor's race led many political observers to predict Nixon's career was over. Within six years, he was President after winning a hard-fought campaign in 1968.
8. Nixon used the comedy show “Laugh In” to get elected. At least, that is what Nixon reportedly said after he did a cameo appearance on the show just weeks before the 1968 election. Hubert Humphrey refused to do a similar appearance on the show.
9. Nixon was the first President to visit a nation not recognized by our own government. Nixon's trip to China in 1972 was unique, since the United States recognized Taiwan as the legitimate government of mainland China.
10. The Checkers speech was partially intended as an inside joke about FDR. The national TV speech that saved Nixon's career in 1952 was a masterful political move, but the reference to Checkers the dog was meant as a jab at FDR's famous Fala speech that Republicans would get. Years later, Nixon was still upset that it was called the Checkers speech and people mostly remembered the reference to his pet dog.
IT IS not often that one hears positive stories about the police, and their image suffers from various negative portrayals. However, Andheri police recently had a different story to share — one about how they won the admiration of a foreign national visiting the city. Argentine national Augustine Gonzalez (21), a student who is currently visiting India, had Andheri police to thank when they helped him recover his lost backpack, which contained his passport, camera and at least $ 1,000, Thursday.

Gonzalez and his friend, another Argentine tourist, had taken an autorickshaw from Chakala to Andheri station Thursday at 12 noon. When they alighted and paid the autorickshaw driver, Gonzalez left his blue backpack in the backseat of the autorickshaw. His bag contained his passport, documents and medical certificates, a Go Pro camera, a Canon camera and at least $1,000. Upon realising that he had left his bag in the vehicle, Gonzalez and his friend went to Andheri police station to report the incident.
The autorickshaw in which Gonzalez left his bag was tracked down within 11 hours and all items recovered. “I want to say thank you to Andheri station police officers and team for their absolutely remarkable labour on duty, serving and helping the community,” Gonzalez wrote in his note. “Everything was recovered and no harm was caused. They acted immediately and in a completely efficient way. I am grateful after today's episode,” he concluded in his letter.
Andheri police too had a reason to smile. “It feels good to be appreciated sometimes, since most of the time we are seen in a negative light. The foreign national will take away a positive impression of his experience with us,” said Pandit Shankar Thorat, senior police inspector at Andheri police station.
“The Argentine national also said that he will share the story on Facebook and Twitter,” he added. According to the police, they first tracked the autorickshaw's location to Malad, which later turned out to be incorrect. Police also checked nearby rickshaw stands and railway stations in order to locate the vehicle. The rickshaw was later tracked down to Vile Parle with the help of the Regional Transport Office (RTO). Gonzalez could not be reached for comment as he had already left for Ahmedabad.
However, Narendra Moryani, a Rotary youth who was Gonzalez's host in Mumbai and was with his two Argentine guests during the ordeal, spoke to The Indian Express. “Initially, the police were taking their time, even though we had tracked down the address of the autorickshaw driver from the RTO. Fortunately, Augustine was taking photographs with his phone and in one of them, he captured the rickshaw's licence number. After we approached the senior inspector at the station, he sent two officers with us to the driver's address,” said Moryani.

When the driver returned home around 10.30 pm, police recovered the bag. Upon checking, Gonzalez found that his now-expired old passport, which contained his visa papers, was missing. Police then quizzed the driver, who revealed he hid it. The driver then led the police to the spot where the old passport had been hidden. The visa papers were intact.

Synopsis: Budori Gusuko's life was wonderful, living in the forest with his father, mother and younger sister. Then, the weather changed, the villagers he knew moved away, and tragedy stole his sister and parents from him. Forced to wander until he found another place to live, he again settled into a peaceful existence… until the weather changed, and it was all taken from him once again. Now, as he's grown older, Budori has found a job with people who study volcanoes, and when the weather starts to change again, Budori must make the biggest decision of his life. From the classic story by Kenji Miyazawa (NIGHT ON THE GALACTIC RAILROAD) comes an all-new animated masterpiece: THE LIFE OF BUDORI GUSUKO!
Just as preliminary results show he has won his country's landmark election, Kosovo Prime Minister Hashim Thaçi faces allegations of being involved with a mafia-like Albanian group responsible for smuggling weapons and human organs throughout eastern Europe, the Guardian is reporting.
A Council of Europe inquiry report on organized crime named Thaçi as a godfather-like "boss" of a network that began operating criminal rackets in the run-up to the 1999 Kosovo war, and has held powerful sway over the country's government since. The report cites FBI and other intelligence sources, and also names Thaçi as exerting "violent control" over the heroin trade.
On a more grisly note, figures from Thaçi's inner circle are accused of secretly taking captives across the border into Albania after the war, where a few Serbs are said to have been murdered for their kidneys, which were sold on the black market.
Dick Marty, the human rights investigator behind the inquiry, will present his report to European diplomats from all 47 member states at a meeting in Paris on Thursday. The Guardian quotes excerpts from Marty's report:
In confidential reports spanning more than a decade, agencies dedicated to combating drug smuggling in at least five countries have named Hashim Thaçi and other members of his Drenica Group as having exerted violent control over the trade in heroin and other narcotics. Thaçi and these other Drenica Group members are consistently named as "key players" in intelligence reports on Kosovo's mafia-like structures of organised crime. I have examined these diverse, voluminous reports with consternation and a sense of moral outrage.
According to CNN, the report comes at a critical time for Thaçi, whose Democratic Party of Kosovo led the newly independent nation's weekend elections. However, he now faces the challenge of forming a coalition with other government parties, many of which have accused him of electoral fraud.
Christine Lagarde is having some trouble sleeping at night.
The head of the International Monetary Fund said "quite a few countries" are keeping her awake lately, but at the top of the list are low-income nations that rely heavily on exporting oil.
"I think of a country like Nigeria, for instance, where 90% of its exports and 60% of its revenue are generated by oil or oil-related revenues," Lagarde said Sunday in an interview on the sidelines of the Albright Institute at Wellesley College. "That's a country that is facing...a real hardship."
Translation: Loans and bailouts for oil countries are likely coming.
Several countries are running out of money because of cheap oil.
Nigeria is considering asking the World Bank, the African Development Bank and other international organizations for a $9 billion loan.
Azerbaijan is looking for an emergency loan of up to $4 billion. IMF officials have been in the country doing an assessment of the crisis.
Related: This oil producing country may need a bailout
Venezuela is even closer to financial meltdown, although it might turn to other sources for help, like China. Last year, it struck a deal with China to provide oil in exchange for billions in aid.
"Venezuela is about to go belly up, not only politically, but economically, because they misspent their oil revenue before," former U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright told CNNMoney.
Countries that rely heavily on oil were booming when crude oil was selling for over $100 a barrel. But prices crashed at the end of 2014 and have tumbled even lower since. In mid-January crude oil fell below $27 a barrel for the first time in over a decade.
Related: Goldman Sachs: It's too late for OPEC to save oil
"The fact that a price below $100 seemed inconceivable to so many is kind of astonishing," says Mike Lynch, president of Strategic Energy and Economic Research
For now, Lagarde is preaching a message of economic reform.
"It's necessary [for Nigeria] to very promptly redesign its business model and realign its interests with a completely new reality which is here for longer than many think," Lagarde said Sunday.
But experts think loans might be a necessary part of that transition.

Houston and Harris County are poised to decriminalize low-level possession of marijuana in a sweeping move that puts the area at the forefront of efforts in Texas to halt minor drug arrests that clog jails and courts.
District Attorney Kim Ogg announced the new policy Thursday with Mayor Sylvester Turner, Houston Police Chief Art Acevedo and Harris County Sheriff Ed Gonzalez.
The policy, set to begin March 1, means that misdemeanor offenders with less than four ounces of marijuana will not be arrested, ticketed or required to appear in court if they agree to take a four-hour drug education class, officials said.
SWIFT RESPONSE: Reaction strong from both sides on DA's plan to decriminalize small amounts of marijuana
Ogg said the county has spent $25 million a year for the past 10 years locking up people for having less than 4 ounces of marijuana. She said those resources would be better spent arresting serious criminals such as burglars, robbers and rapists.
"We have spent in excess of $250 million, over a quarter-billion dollars, prosecuting a crime that has produced no tangible evidence of improved public safety," she said. "We have disqualified, unnecessarily, thousands of people from greater job, housing and educational opportunities by giving them a criminal record for what is, in effect, a minor law violation."
Officials have said it could divert an estimated 12,000 people a year out of the criminal justice system and would save officers hours of processing time now spent on low-level cases. More than 107,000 cases of misdemeanor marijuana cases have been handled in the past 10 years, officials said.
CRITICISM: Ogg under fire for new marijuana plant
Since there is no arrest, there is no arrest record. Since there is no court date, there are no court documents connected to the encounter. The plan calls for officers to seize the marijuana and drop it off at a police station at the end of their shift, along with a record of the encounter in case the suspect does not take the class.
"You do not get charged with anything," Assistant District Attorney David Mitcham, who heads the DA's trial bureau, said Wednesday. "You have a pathway where you can avoid going to court."
TOUGH LESSON: Texas cop lets teen do 200 pushups instead of arrest of marijuana
Every Harris County law enforcement agency would be affected, since they rely on the district attorney's office to prosecute their cases.

Ogg, a Democrat who beat incumbent Republican District Attorney Devon Anderson in the November general election, campaigned as a reform candidate who pledged to reduce arrests for low-level drug offenses.
Reaction to the proposal was swift, coming even before details of the program were officially unveiled. Montgomery County District Attorney Brett Ligon sharply criticized the proposal, saying Ogg was trying to legalize marijuana.

“The CTPTs (Afghan Counter-Terrorism Pursuit Teams) are getting their motherfu&*ing slay on tonight,” a Ground Branch paramilitary officer said as he watched tracer fire shoot through the night sky near their forward operating base on the Pakistani border.
“GB (Ground Branch) officers constituted the main force at Stone and were selected from among the baddest-ass military units—SEALs, Marine Force Recon, Air Force parajumpers, and the Army's Combat Applications Group (formerly known as Delta Force). They wore civilian clothes and were equipped with the most advanced light weaponry on the planet,” writes former CIA Case Officer John Smith in his book, “Left of Boom.”
Ground Branch is a part of the CIA's Special Activities Division, which also includes Air Branch and Maritime Branch. As the author noted, GB paramilitary officers are primarily recruited from the special operations community. At one point known as a sort of good-old-boys network, Ground Branch was once heavily represented by former Marines. Later, GB became heavy with retired Delta Force sergeant majors. These days, things are a bit different, with the CIA preferring to contract younger former sergeants out of Army Special Forces who they can raise up through the ranks of the agency over a longer period of time.
Although most GB officers are competent in their core tasks, one issue that often arises is that the CIA paramilitary operations officers (PMOOs) in charge of these programs are usually on the agency career track, and generally don't have any military background. This results in some lopsided results, as one can imagine. It sucks for the PMOOs, too, because after a few tours to an active war zone, they have to start doing normal case officer duties around the world. There, they are expected to be Johnny-on-the-spot when it comes to recruiting assets, but they are competing with peers who have been doing the case officer job since day one of their time at the CIA.
John Smith was fortunate: When he arrived at his firebase, he was reunited with a friend from The Farm named Rick G., a former Special Forces soldier who had applied for the CIA and gone through the tradecraft training needed to become a case officer. Rick was in charge of Ground Branch at that location. This seems to be a growing trend as well—PMOOs who are former Green Berets or Marines. Historically, these program managers have been quite a bit younger than the contractors who work for them. While the program managers are full-fledged CIA case officers or staff operations officers, actual Ground Branch officers (or operators if you prefer) are contracted employees. Contrary to popular belief, you do not need a bachelor's degree in order to join.
When people envision Ground Branch, they tend to picture “Rainbow Six” or “Splinter Cell” black helicopter-type stuff, but the reality is that their mission is essentially the same as the unconventional warfare mission of Army Special Forces (Green Berets). What makes GB unique is that they can operate under the CIA's Title 50 authority for covert action. This makes GB a deniable force, unlike active-duty SEALs, Rangers, or Delta operators.
GB has been very active in both Afghanistan and Iraq during the Global War on Terror, but their actions are rarely reported by the press. Even less known is the role that GB played in the Libyan Civil War, when Gaddafi was overthrown after President Obama signed an executive action authorizing clandestine support to rebel factions. Today, GB officers are active in northern Syria with the Kurdish YPG militia, where they provide tactical support in the war against ISIS.
With a history stretching back to the OSS in World War Two and America's secret war in Laos during the Vietnam conflict, paramilitary officers give policymakers strategic and tactical options when deciding whether or not they should intervene in foreign conflicts. Ground Branch offers a deployable paramilitary force capable of conducting covert operations, technically something that JSOC is unable to do as their low-visibility missions are considered operational preparation of the environment.
Beauty queen 'shoots intruder dead with her pink gun during fight with her fiancé'
Meghan Brown opened door to intruder at 3am in Florida thinking he was a friend
Girlfriend of killed Albert Hill says: 'It's a shame everything went down the way it did'
A beauty queen has told how she shot and killed a burglar as he wrestled with her fiancé during a break-in in the middle of the night.
Police are investigating the death of Albert Hill at 3am in an incident at the Florida mansion which Meghan Brown, 25, shares with fianc é Bobby Planthaber Jr, 43.
The 2009 Miss Tierra Verde had opened the door to him on March 12 in the early hours thinking he was a friend needing a bed for the night.
Shocked: Meghan Brown and fiance Robert (Bobby) Planthaber Jr stand with dog Vixen near their front door where they say they fought an intruder before Meghan shot him four times
Fatally wounded: Albert Hill was shot and killed
But she claims the 42-year-old, 18-stone man grabbed her from behind and covered her nose and mouth with his hand, before heading straight to the bedroom.
As she screamed, her fianc é emerged, later telling the St Petersburg Times: 'My number one objective is to get this guy off my fianc é e.'
Detectives said the intruder then ordered him to give him money.
The fight between the two men broke the dining room table and chairs but, as they tussled, Miss Brown produced her pink gun from her bedside table.
'I had my gun drawn, focused in on him - as he moved, my gun moved. I waited for my shot and when I saw an opening, I fired,' she told the newspaper.
Miss Brown said she was 'glad' it had been her, because not everybody else would have been as prepared as she was.
'The way I see it is, the guy was a really bad guy and if it wasn't my bullets, it probably would have been the police officer's bullets,' she said.
'It's not like he was going to turn his life around.'

Back in the day, my very first car was a BB6 Honda Prelude. I loved the thing; from meets with friends to spirited drives, it really was my gateway into the world of car culture.
When the AP1 Honda S2000 released in 1999, the front mid-engined, rear-wheel drive sports car was an absolute game changer, and perhaps the natural progression for Prelude owners. I never made that change, but not because I didn't want to.
So when I saw Kurumadoh Custom Factory's AP1 blasting around Tsukuba Circuit at the recent Rev Speed magazine Hyper Meeting, I knew I had to find out more about it.
The small tuning shop based out of Iwate in the Tōhoku Prefecture of northeastern Honshu, made the five-hour trek down to Tsukuba for the event. Not only did they want to show off their street-registered but track-spec S2000, they were interested to see what sort of lap times it could achieve at the home of Japanese time attack with its latest upgrades and fine tuning.
Based solely on the intoxicating sound coming from the Toda exhaust as it flew by, you could tell that a lot of work had gone into the F20C, and back in the paddock I had a chance to check out the setup that's been living under the car's carbon fiber hood for a few years now. The Kurumadoh Custom Factory guys explained that the F20C has been stroked to 2.2L and features Toda Racing A2 camshafts among many other upgrades.
But the star of the engine bay is the HKS GTS7040 supercharger, which with a pulley swap to raise boost pressure sees overall power lifted to right around 400PS. To get it to the ground, Kurumadoh Custom Factory specced their own LSD unit specifically for the application.
In the wheel department, the Super Lap version of a RAYS classic provides a lightweight, forged solution. The Volk Racing CE28SLs measure 18×10-inch and are wrapped in 295/30R18 Yokohama Advan rubber. Through the wheels' spokes you can see the D2 Racing brakes featuring 6-pot calipers at the front and 4-pots at the rear for plenty of stopping power.
Aero is a vital tool in time attack racing, and Kurumadoh hasn't skimped on the details. The S2000 benefits from a carbon fiber front lip, canards, functional bolt-on overfenders, and a GT wing out back.
Despite what I expected, the interior hasn't been stripped out. In fact, most of the Honda's original creature comforts remain intact, including all the trim and even the carpet. There are some upgrades though, including a Cusco bolt-in half cage, Recaro seats, a Momo MOD 08 steering wheel and a host of aftermarket gauges.
So what does it all add up to? Well, with Kimi Yamada in the hot seat, Kurumadoh Custom Factory's Honda joined the Fast class and managed to lap Tsukuba in a respectable 1:01.869.
I don't know about you, but this build only rekindles my want for an S2000!

This was everything we have ever wanted Ricky Rubio to be.
He was his usual play-making self last night in the Timberwolves win against the Lakers, racking up 14 assists and setting up other teammates to draw fouls under the basket. He threw some fancy passes, like his no-look pass to Karl-Anthony Towns in the lane, and also threaded some, like his full-court pass that went just over the fingertips of a defender and right into the arms of a streaking Nemanja Bjelica.
He also played his customary great defense, helping to hold highly-touted rookie and second-overall pick DeAngelo Russell to four points. He recorded just one steal, but the team defense cratered when either he or Kevin Garnett weren't in the game. His ability and leadership on that end of the floor was apparent all game.
Ricky provided everything we have come accustomed to.
But there was also the points.
Bucket after bucket came straight from Ricky's hands. He opened the game's scoring by nailing a three-pointer. The ball was swung around to him in the left corner, and he stepped up and hit it with confidence.
He hit a couple of free throws, then pushed the ball on the fast break, dribbling between two Lakers to get to the rim for a layup. He took and made a contested three off a pick-and-roll with Towns a few minutes later. By this point, he had 10 points in just over six minutes of game time. He was feeling it, and the Timberwolves were winning.
The points never stopped coming, as he finished with a career-high 28. Ricky was aggressive in looking for his shot the entire game. Coming off the pick-and-roll, he was looking to take that 18-foot jumper. He and the coaches have talked about having that mindset in previous years, but there were actual results this game. The aggressiveness Ricky showed was unprecedented and extremely encouraging for the future.
However, that's not to say that Ricky was only looking for his own shot; his 14 assists show as much. But if you need further proof, there was a perfect example late in the 4th quarter.
Ricky had just made a shot from the left elbow on the previous possession and found himself there with room again. He went up looking to shoot, but then stopped himself just short. He teetered on his tiptoes for a second, then threw a post entry to Towns, who had deep position on the left block. That led to a nice turnaround fade-away from Towns to tie the game at 97.
The play is at the 2:43 mark here, but the whole video is worth watching:
Ricky had 21 points at that point and was really feeling it, but he recognized that, for as well as he was shooting, Towns likely had the higher percentage shot. He spotted open shooters and backdoor cutters while running the pick-and-roll all game. His vision certainly is just as elite as it was before.
The difference in this game is that he was actively looking for his own shot. Furthermore, he was actually making them. Open looks, contested looks, spot-up, off-the-dribble. It didn't matter. He made them all game.
What does this mean for the Timberwolves? A Ricky Rubio that's even an average scoring threat would open up so much for this offense. Defenses would have to begin working over the tops of screens in the pick-and-roll, opening up space for the screener to roll down the lane.
His defender wouldn't be able to sag off of him to clog the lane for Andrew Wiggins and others when they drive. Help defenders would have to step up as he comes off the pick and penetrates, opening up easy passes.
With Rubio's vision and unmatched passing ability, he can make defenses pay for being even slightly out of position. If he is able to warp defenses with the scoring proficiency he showed last night, everybody is going to be spoon-fed wide open threes and easy layups/dunks.
Now, it was only one game, and it was against a Lakers team that was “awful” last year, as Mike Tirico called them on ESPN's broadcast. It will take a few more weeks of this (at least) before we can anoint this version of Ricky Rubio as the new normal.
But remember, he just turned 25 a week ago. This is his 5th year in the league, but he still hasn't hit his prime yet. It is well within the realm of possibilities that he will continue to improve. People have become used to Rubio not being a good shooter, but he's still a young player with the ability to improve. Mike Penberthy has made Rubio's shooting mechanics much more fluid, and that bodes well for future success.
The version of Ricky Rubio that was in the Staples Center last night opens up options for the Timberwolves that haven't even been considered yet. I don't know if it will stick, but I am optimistic. Ever since he came back from his ankle injury last season, his shot has looked so much better. That didn't lead to improved results last year, but with a summer to keep working on it, he showed what he can do on a good night.
People will remain unconvinced until he proves he can shoot consistently, and their skepticism is well deserved. Four consecutive years of poor shooting is infinitely more predictive than one game against a bad team. He won't regularly put up 28 and 14.
But if he can be a consistent shooter, this Wolves team will be transformed. Between the new shot mechanics, his youth, and his rising confidence in his shot, there is a good chance that the Rubio we saw last night is here to stay, and it's everything we've ever wanted.
ORLANDO, Fla. -- Orlando Magic officials say they're entering a three-year deal which designates the Erie BayHawks of the NBA Development League as the NBA club's minor league affiliate.
Orlando is now the 16th NBA team to have a one-to-one affiliation with an NBA D-League team.
The deal allows the Magic to run the BayHawks' basketball operations while the minor league franchise's local owners continue to oversee off-the-court business including ticket sales, marketing and community initiatives.
Magic chief executive officer Alex Martins says he expects the relationship with Erie to further assist Orlando's efforts to develop NBA talent.
NBA D-League president Dan Reed says the agreement demonstrates the minor league's "increasing significance."
The NBA D-League, which has operated for 13 seasons, had 36 players called up to the NBA during the 2013-14 season.
The prevailing stock market ideology enriches value extractors, not value creators
Conventional wisdom holds that the primary function of the stock market is to raise cash that companies use to invest in productive capabilities. The conventional wisdom is wrong. Academic research on corporate finance shows that, compared with other sources of funds, stock markets in advanced countries have in fact been insignificant suppliers of capital to corporations. What, then, is their function? If we are to understand employment opportunity, income distribution, and productivity growth, we need an accurate analysis of the role of the stock market in the corporate economy.
The insignificance of the stock market as a source of real investment capital exposes as fallacious the fundamental assumptions of the prevailing ideology that, for the sake of economic efficiency, a business corporation should be run to “maximize shareholder value” (MSV). As a rule, public shareholders do not invest in a corporation's productive capabilities; they simply buy shares outstanding on the market, hoping to extract value that they have played no role in helping to create. And in practice, MSV advocates modes of corporate resource allocation that undermine innovative enterprise and result in unstable employment, inequitable incomes, and sagging productivity.
The most obvious manifestations of the corporate misbehavior that MSV incentivizes are the lavish, stock-based incomes of top corporate executives and the massive distributions of corporate cash to shareholders in the form of stock buybacks, coming on top of already-ample dividends. Indeed, with stock-based pay incentivizing senior executives to do stock buybacks—i.e., having a company repurchase its own shares to give manipulative boosts to its stock price—over the past three decades the stock market has had a negative cash function. On the whole, U.S. business corporations fund the stock market, not vice versa.
My INET paper, “The Functions of the Stock Market and the Fallacies of Shareholder Value,” provides an analysis of the evolving role of the stock market in the U.S. corporate economy over the past century. I ask how the changing functions of the stock market have influenced the processes of value creation (hence, the size of the economic pie), as well as the relation between value creation and value extraction (hence, the distribution of the economic pie). This essay is part of an ongoing project aimed at making “The Theory of Innovative Enterprise” central to an economic analysis that comprehends institutions' and organizations' roles in supporting or undermining stable and equitable economic growth.
The Theory of Innovative Enterprise posits that three social conditions of innovative enterprise—strategic control, organizational integration, and financial commitment—determine whether a business can generate goods and services that are higher quality and lower cost than those previously available. The process of value creation enabled by innovative enterprise enhances the performance of both the company and the economy of which it is a part. Once armed with a theory of innovative enterprise, we can analyze the relation between those who contribute to the processes of value creation and those who reap incomes through value extraction. We can discern how “predatory value extractors,” who make little if any contribution to value creation, use their power to dominate the distribution of income.
In terms of the three social conditions of innovative enterprise: Strategic control gives decision makers the power to allocate the firm's resources to transform technologies and access new markets to generate higher-quality, lower-cost products; organizational integration creates incentives for people working together to engage in the collective learning that is the essence of the value-creation process; financial commitment secures funds to sustain the cumulative learning process, from the time when investments in productive capabilities are made until innovative products generate financial returns.
The functions of the stock market may support or undermine the social conditions of innovative enterprise. The functions of the stock market go well beyond “cash” to include four others, which can be summarized as “control,” “creation,” “combination,” and “compensation.” Historically, as the U.S. economy grew to become the world's largest and most powerful, the key function of the stock market was control. Specifically, the stock market enabled the separation of managerial control over the allocation of corporate resources from the ownership of the shares in the company.
Yet, assuming that the key function of the stock market is cash, academic economists known as agency theorists see this separation of control from ownership as the “original sin” of American capitalism. They argue that the evils of managerial control can be overcome by incentivizing or, if necessary, compelling corporate managers as “agents” to maximize the value of the stock possessed by corporate shareholders as “principals.” The agency-theory mantra is that the key role of managers is to “disgorge” the “free” cash flow to shareholders in the forms of dividends and buybacks.
What is missing from the agency theory argument is a theory of how a firm creates value—that is, a theory of innovative enterprise. The functions of the stock market may support the types of strategic control, organizational integration, and financial commitment that can result in the generation of higher quality products at lower unit costs—the economic definition of innovation. It is possible, however, that the functions of the stock market may undermine the types of strategic control, organizational integration, and financial commitment that the innovation process requires.
Indeed, by following the prescriptions of agency theory—that senior executives should be incentivized by stock-based pay to “create value” for shareholders—corporate managers have undermined the conditions of innovative enterprise in U.S. corporations over the past three decades. Consider each of the three social conditions:
Strategic control: Senior executives who are willing to waste hundreds of millions or billions of dollars annually on buybacks to manipulate their companies' stock prices can lose the capacity to determine what types of organizational and technological investments are required to remain innovative in their industries. Instead, the current structure of stock-based executive remuneration—as prescribed by agency theory—creates incentives for senior executives to allocate resources in ways that boost stock prices and increase their take-home pay. The stock buyback is a powerful tool at the disposal of corporate executives for manipulating the stock market for their personal gain.
Organizational integration: Collective and cumulative learning about the technologies, markets, and competitors relevant to a particular industry is the foundation for generating the higher-quality, lower-cost goods and services that result in productivity growth. What I call “collective and cumulative careers” are essential for organizational learning, especially in industries that are technologically and organizationally complex. Organizational learning depends on a “retain-and-reinvest” regime. In such an arrangement, senior executives make corporate resource-allocation decisions that, by retaining people and profits in the company, permit reinvestment in the productive capabilities that can generate competitive (high-quality, low-cost) products. Our research supports the hypothesis that, as part of a corporate resource-allocation regime that downsizes the U.S. labor force and distributes corporate cash to shareholders, stock buybacks are done at the expense of investments in collective and cumulative careers. For working people who are the real value creators, the “disgorged” cash flow is far from “free.”
Financial commitment: The cash flow that MSV calls “free” can deprive the business enterprise of the foundational finance for investment in innovative enterprise. Stock buybacks represent a depletion of internally-controlled finance that could be used to support investment in the company's productive capabilities. Every once in a while, a major company that has done massive buybacks over a period of years hits a financial wall. At that point the billions of dollars it wasted on buybacks are not available to support the restructuring needed for it to become innovative once again. The process of predatory value extraction that destroys innovative enterprise is irreversible. It must be stopped before it starts.
Israel's security is renowned for being particularly tight, but officials failed to detect a 3-D printed gun when a local TV show snuck it into the Knesset – the country's parliament building in Jerusalem. Twice.Israel's Channel 10 has given us a taste of what might happen when the wrong people get their hands on 3-D printing technology.
Masdar in Abu Dhabi has purchased a 3-D printer to manufacture solar cells, and Objet is using the technology to print dashboards for electric cars, but not everyone who uses the technology has noble intentions.
After printing a 3-D pistol on camera, the staff of the “Tzinor Layla” (Nightline) program then proceeded to sneak into the heavily fortified Knesset building undetected, according to Ha'aretz.
One of the journalists stood within feet of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu with the gun in his possession.
“He passed all the stages of the security check, which even included an inspection with a magnetometer, and approached the prime minister without anyone noticing the pistol,” writes Ha'aretz.
At another time, the crew entered the Chairwoman of the Interior Committee's office, also undetected.
Although the TV channel was criticized for their “dubious experiment,” they raised very interesting questions about how Israel (and the rest of the world) will respond to a brave new world where just about anyone with some means can print deadly, unlicensed weapons at their own home.
“This is a new phenomenon that confronts all the security systems in Israel and abroad with an entirely new type of challenge,” said Knesset Security Officer Yosef Grif.
“In the Knesset, as in all the government ministries and public institutions, the subject is now being examined in order to provide a solution as soon as possible.”
Cody Wilson made headlines all over the world a couple of months ago when he distributed video footage of the world's first 3-D printed pistol successfully firing live bullets at a target.
Just 25 years old, the Texas law student started a firm called Defense Distributed, through which he obtained a license to manufacture weapons.

To justify the Liberator and other “wiki weapons,” the company cites John Milton's Areopagitica, for the Liberty of Unlicenc'd Printing, written to the Parliament of England in response to the Licensing Order of 1643 that sought to censor publications prior to printing.
They also site the second amendment to the US Constitution that gives all “men” the right to keep and bear arms.
Moves have been made in the United States to require anyone who prints a gun to have it registered, but we all know that's not going to happen.

Leading game maker Electronic Arts (EA) is refusing to remove LGBT content after being targeted by anti-gay groups.
EA says it has received thousands of letters and emails and forum comments as part of a co-originated campaign. It includes gay characters in its games, most notably Mass Effect 3 and Star Wars: The Old Republic,
“Every one of EA's games includes [Entertainment Software Rating Board] ESRB content descriptors so it's hard to believe anyone is surprised by the content. This isn't about protecting children, it's about political harassment,” Jeff Brown, VP of corporate communications told Games Industry International.
The campaign claims that EA was forced to include gay characters by LGBT groups and that they are forced on children — neither of which is true.
“EA has not been pressured by any groups to include LGBT characters in our games. However, we have met with LBGT groups and sponsored industry forums to discuss content and harassment of players in online forums. In short, we do put options for same-sex relationships in our games; we don't tolerate hate speech on our forums,” Brown said.
The campaign follows those against JC Penny over the hiring of lesbian talk show host Ellen Degeneres and against Starbucks over their support for marriage equality. Both campaigns failed.
A spokesperson for GLAAD (Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation) said, “trying to rally Americans around messages rooted in hate is a losing proposition.”
Most of the letters seem to have been generated by the Florida Family Association, which is a one-man “group,” which seems to exist to run boycotts and raise money for itself. It also targeted advertisers on the now-cancelled reality TV show All-American Muslim.
Another group which has been involved in the EA attack is the Family Research Council, which is on Southern Poverty Law Center's list of hate groups.
EA was the first gaming company to join the anti-bullying ‘It Gets Better Project.' As with Starbucks, a petition is being organized to thank EA for its support for inclusive gaming.

Jamie Carragher has picked the Liverpool side he'd choose to play Man United at Anfield on Sunday.
The former Reds' defender says he wouldn't start Steven Gerrard: “No, I wouldn't. The team's playing well, they're on a great run since Steven's been out. Unfortunately, he'll know himself, when the team goes on a great run when you're out it's hard to get back in the team.
“It's unfortunate for him. There are players here who are playing too well, you can't leave them out.”
Carragher also picks Raheem Sterling up front rather than Daniel Sturridge, commenting how Sterling's high intensity pressing is better right now.
Carragher's LFC side to face United
Liverpool are two points behind their rivals going into the game, a win would put them above United and into the top four for the first time this season. Kick off on Sunday is 1.30pm GMT.

I am not a big fan of attaching devices to my walls and running cables to control and power them. That is the situation with VR today. The Oculus Rift and HTC Vive both require sensors placed in ideal for VR and not for decor locations. Owning a Rift and Vive means I have lots of them.
Imagine a day in the future when cables and sensors to track your position may not be needed? That would be a truly glorious day indeed!
That future is in sight, however. Inside out tracking as it is called aims to do away with the need for separate sensors. The headset itself will do all the work. The PICO Neo CV is one of the first companies to deliver on the inside out tracking providing the six degrees of freedom.
The PICO Neo CV achieves the inside out tracking with a combination of a camera using computer vision to view the outside world, a gyroscope, and accelerometer. The CPU powering the headset is the new Snapdragon 820 SoC (System on a chip) from Qualcomm which also drives the 1.5k per eye display refreshing at 90 Hz.
![PICO Neo CV prototype](/content/images/2017/06/pico-new-cv-4.jpg) ![PICO Neo CV prototype](/content/images/2017/06/pico-new-cv-5.jpg)
Does it work?
I tried the Neo CV in an area where I had plenty of room to walk around and try it out. I played a game with zombies coming at me which I could shoot at or stab with the hand controller. I found myself able to walk and look around in complete freedom. Even though it was a prototype unit, the tracking appeared flawless. The drawback was when I moved my head quickly to the side. There was some noticeable lag, not due to the 90 Hz screens, but rather the 20 Hz camera-based tracking system.
Pricing and release dates for the PICO Neo CV have not been released yet. The Neo is expected later this year. Also, later this year providing the same six degrees of freedom without sensors is the line of Windows VR headsets from the likes of HP, Dell, Acer, and Lenovo.
My office may be able to do away with sensors in the not too distant future...
Much has been made of the fact that Fyre Festival, the luxury music fest turned Lord of the Flies scenario going down in the Bahamas this weekend, was backed in part by Ja Rule. But Ja isn't solely responsible for the nightmare, and the business history of Billy McFarland, his Fyre Media cofounder, might provide some insights as to what went wrong at the festival.
Fyre Festival, a weekend-long event in the Exuma Islands of the Bahamas, was billed as a “a cultural moment created from a blend of music, art, and food,” with tickets that sold for up to thousands of dollars each. (Read more about it here.) On social media Thursday evening and Friday morning, attendees posted about cancelled flights, limited access to food and water, and nasty-looking cheese sandwiches. Blink-182, one of the top-billed performers, has already dropped out. It's still not exactly clear what went wrong, but it seems likely that Fyre's organizers were in way over their heads–a hypothesis that was being put forth in gossip publications like Page Six weeks before the festival even began.
This isn't McFarland's first poorly planned venture. The 20-something entrepreneur also founded Magnises, a kind of social club that originally aspired to be the American Express “black card” for millennials. New members paid a $450 entry fee for the privilege of carrying around a credit card-sized slab of shiny black metal in their wallets. But it wasn't really a credit card: as the New York Times noted in a 2013 piece about Magnises, “It is just a way to dress up your everyday Wells Fargo or Bank of America card. Magnises simply transfers the data from the magnetic strip of that old card onto its blank metal card, like copying a CD, and then the Magnises card can be used in place of the original.” At some point along the way, Magnises nixed the black card idea in favor of an app, transitioned to a $250 annual fee, and got rid of an early provision that allowed members to sign up by referral only.
If not for access to funds, what's the point of signing up? Magnises promises its members “valuable benefits and members-only offers.” The company's website currently advertises small discounts on services from startups like Cleanly and Handy, plus a list of past Magnises perks, such as access to reserved tables at the season-opening night of the Southampton nightclub AM last year. Many of the listings on the site are for offers that have already expired.
Earlier this year, Business Insider published a detailed story headlined “Members of a private club for ‘elite' millennials want their money back.” Based on interviews with seven Magnises members, it alleged that Magnises didn't quite live up to the top-dollar experience it offered. Members said events they'd purchased tickets to were frequently canceled or rescheduled on very short notice, and that they sometimes received unwanted charges on their credit cards that took multiple weeks to be refunded. One member's story, via Business Insider:
One former member, who also spoke on condition of anonymity, said that they bought several tickets for several events — including Beyoncé's concert at Citi Field, one of Adele's shows at Madison Square Garden, and a performance of “Hamilton” — soon after joining Magnises in February 2016. This member claims to have had logistical issues with nearly every event for which they had purchased tickets. Each time, just before the show (often the day before the event or even the day of) a representative for Magnises would send an email explaining that the startup would no longer be able to provide the purchased ticket and offer to help reschedule the seat for another date. “They send the same email for every problem, but it's like fill-in-the-blanks for what the problem is,” the person said.
In summer 2016, the company began offering private flights to exotic locales. One such trip was to New Orleans, where members would attend a concert by Ashanti and… Ja Rule. A former member named Robert Egan said he booked trips to Cuba and Miami via Magnises, and that after a series of cancellations and rescheduled flights, he came to believe that the company had not even secured the necessary visas to travel to Cuba. He ended up taking neither of the trips, and the experience prompted him to cancel his membership.
Based on testimony from Magnises members and Frye attendees, it sounds like each business operated on a similar model: promote an aspirational lifestyle of glitz and exclusivity, charge a lot of money membership, and fail to deliver on the promised experience. We look forward to seeing whatever scheme McFarland comes up with next.
(CBS/AP) CLIFTON, N.J. - Fire officials say a roofing company employee jumped into a vat of nitric acid to save a co-worker who fell 40 feet through a roof and into the tank.
Clifton Fire Chief Vince Colavitti tells The Record of Woodland Park the men were part of a crew working at Swepco Tube LLC in Clifton when the accident occurred around 8:40 a.m. Monday.
"His exact words were, 'I had to get him out,'" Colavitti told local CBS Radio affiliate 1010 Wins. "He took his life and put it in harm's way to save a co-worker and that speaks a lot for a person."
Relatives say 44-year-old Martin Davis suffered a broken rib, punctured lung, and burns on his legs and side. He's in critical condition.
Colavitti says 51-year-old Rob Nuckols was on the ground floor and jumped into the vat. He was waist-high in acid while he and three others pulled Davis out. Nuckols was treated for burns.
Pharmacist prescribing of cholesterol-lowering drugs leads more patients to reach cholesterol goals: study
September 29, 2016 (Ottawa): When pharmacists help patients reach cholesterol goals — by assessing their risk, prescribing drugs, ordering tests, and explaining results — more than three times as many patients reach their target cholesterol and their cholesterol levels drop farther than for patients given only test results, a pamphlet, and usual care, finds a study published in the September/October 2016 issue of the Canadian Pharmacists Journal.
The study was conducted in Alberta, the only province in Canada that authorizes certified pharmacists to prescribe any needed medications for the patients they see (see Pharmacists rise to challenge of prescribing). In other provinces, pharmacists can prescribe certain medications in certain circumstances (see How is pharmacists' scope of practice expanding?), but in a more limited fashion.
The study provides strong evidence that allowing pharmacists to prescribe drugs and order lab tests — among other steps in patient care — can lead to positive health outcomes, said the study authors. It is the first study to look at effects of pharmacist care that includes prescribing on cholesterol levels. In previous studies, pharmacists have referred patients to other health care providers, mainly physicians, for medication.
High cholesterol levels are a common problem in Canada. The Canadian Health Measures survey, conducted from 2007 to 2009, found that roughly 36% of all Canadians and 43% of those aged 40 to 59 had unhealthy levels of LDL cholesterol, the unwanted or “bad” type of cholesterol that leads to cardiovascular disease such as heart attacks and strokes. (See Why do so many Canadians have unhealthy levels of cholesterol?)
This study, which started in January 2012 and concluded in mid-2014, tackled the problem of high cholesterol using a treatment and monitoring approach, explained authors Dr. Ross Tsuyuki and Dr. Glen Pearson, both pharmacists and professors of medicine at the University of Alberta.
“The first step is identifying people who have high cholesterol,” said Pearson. “If you can't identify them, it doesn't matter what you try to do. This involves pharmacists being systematic and finding cases.” Ninety-nine patients with high- or moderate-risk cholesterol levels were found and randomly assigned to “usual care” (a test for cholesterol, a pamphlet on cardiovascular disease, and whatever steps the pharmacist and physician would normally take) or to assessment, treatment and monitoring.
The approach included assessment of the patients' risk and health goals and beliefs, repeated follow-up and testing for cholesterol over six months, prescription of cholesterol-lowering drugs or changes to existing prescriptions (many patients had high cholesterol levels despite taking medication), and information about what the test results meant and how the patients' risk was changing. “The whole package is important,” emphasized Pearson. “The patient needs to understand the disease — the rationale for treatment, what the benefits are expected to be. It needs to be put into an appropriate context.”
The lower level of cholesterol achieved in the treatment group would be expected to reduce heart attacks, death due to coronary disease, and the need for bypass surgery or angioplasty by 13%, and to reduce stroke by 11%.
Pharmacist involvement is key to these results, said the authors. As front-line primary care professionals, pharmacists see many patients at risk for cardiovascular disease, and often more frequently than physicians do. “Our study doesn't say ‘pharmacists are better than physicians.' It says we have a different and complementary approach,” said Tsuyuki. Pearson believes that pharmacists have a role in preventive health care. “We are reaching people earlier. If we can treat high cholesterol early, we can prevent problems.”
Since high cholesterol is one of the major public health problems in Canada, it makes sense to have pharmacists identifying and treating the problem, said Tsuyuki. At a recent conference, Tsuyuki asked an audience of US and Canadian cardiologists (physicians specializing in heart disease), “If you were truly serious about public health and wanted to reduce heart disease, why would you not be supportive of having thousands of helping hands — additional primary care providers — supporting you and patients?” He said many of the cardiologists were supportive of the role of pharmacists in prevention of heart disease.

Background
Why do so many Canadians have unhealthy levels of cholesterol?
There are many reasons for the high rate of unhealthy levels of cholesterol among Canadians, said Tsuyuki and Pearson. Patients may not have a physician or may not go to their physician. Even if their doctor has found high cholesterol levels and prescribed medication, patients may not take it as directed.
“This is a condition that doesn't really have any symptoms,” said Tsuyuki. Patients may feel fine and may lack motivation to take action to prevent cardiovascular events that could be years away. Pearson said other studies have shown that achieving an end goal is important for patients. “If you have no symptoms that are perceivably reduced or improved, then people might think, why bother?”
“There is also a lot of misinformation about cholesterol-lowering drugs,” such as concern about side effects, that may lead to poor patient adherence to prescribed drugs, said Tsuyuki.
As well, physicians may prescribe medication, but patients may fail to follow up to ensure they have reached their target for cholesterol.
“Patients have been treated, but are not at goal,” explained Pearson. Some studies estimate that a high percentage of heart attacks and strokes result from “clinical inertia” that leads to under-treatment of risk factors. “Clinical inertia” is when treatment of chronic conditions does not meet targets such as blood sugar control, blood pressure control, and cholesterol lowering. Issues on the part of both physicians and patients have been found to contribute to this problem.
How are pharmacists' scope of practice expanding?
In recent years, provincial and territorial laws and regulations that set out what pharmacists are permitted to do (“scope of practice”) have been updated in order to meet the health care needs of Canadians. As a result, pharmacists in many provinces and territories can perform some services that were previously restricted to physicians and, in some cases, nurses.
In this study, pharmacists ordered laboratory (blood) tests for patients; they also checked past and current test results; and they prescribed drugs or changed existing prescriptions. Only pharmacists in Alberta currently have the authorization to prescribe any drug — in many other provinces they can prescribe drugs in a collaborative practice setting, for certain common conditions, for smoking cessation or in an emergency. To be authorized to assess patients and start drug therapy, Alberta pharmacists require additional certification.
Canadian pharmacists have added many other services to their repertoire:
Ordering and interpreting lab tests (Alberta, Manitoba, Quebec and Nova Scotia, pending in Saskatchewan, New Brunswick and PEI)
Providing prescription renewals or extensions (all provinces plus Northwest Territories)
Changing drug dosages or formulations (all provinces)
Making therapeutic substitutions (all provinces except Manitoba, Ontario and Quebec)
Administering drugs by injection (all provinces except Quebec, and pending in Saskatchewan)
In Alberta, where this study was conducted, pharmacists have had a widely expanded scope of practice since 2012. For patients with multiple chronic conditions such as diabetes or asthma, and at least one risk factor such as smoking, obesity or addiction, they conduct comprehensive annual care plans that include an assessment, medication history, resolution of drug-related problems and a follow-up and monitoring plan. For patients with at least one chronic condition who take at least four medications, a standard medication management assessment is conducted.

Pharmacists rise to challenge of prescribing
For many of the pharmacists participating in this study, prescribing was a relatively new part of their practice, as pharmacists in Alberta have been able to prescribe since only 2012.
Co-author Dr. Meagan Rosenthal, an assistant professor of pharmacy administration at the University of Mississippi, says that using their knowledge of medication has always been part of the culture of pharmacists. “What the prescribing component has added to that is that pharmacists don't just recommend to another practitioner. They really have to step it up and take accountability.”
Dr. Tsuyuki agreed: “What changed with prescribing was pharmacists having to take ultimate, final responsibility. It's an important step along a spectrum of responsibility.”
Dr. Rosenthal said the study team worked with the pharmacists to help them obtain prescribing authority and integrate prescribing into their practice for the long term. “We were also demonstrating how these types of services could be successfully implemented in all practices in a sustainable way, even once the study ended.”
Authority to prescribe needs to go hand-in-hand with other practices traditionally reserved to physicians or nurses. The ability to order tests and see previous test results is crucial to monitoring improvement and adverse events due to medication, for example.
“Without access to the labs, this study would not have been possible,” said Rosenthal. Pearson added that being able to monitor adverse events “made the pharmacists more comfortable” and helped them with the transition to their new role.

A 22-year-old woman from Olney, Maryland, is dead after a 12-year-old boy jumped from an overpass and landed on her car. Police are investigating the incident as a suicide attempt.
WASHINGTON — A woman is dead after a 12-year-old boy jumped from an overpass and landed on her car on Interstate 66 in Fairfax County on Saturday.
Marisa W. Harris, a 22-year-old from Olney, Maryland, was killed while driving east on I-66 when a 12-year-old boy jumped from the Cedar Lane overpass near Nutley Street, Virginia State Police say.
The impact incapacitated Harris, so her front-seat passenger, a 23-year-old man who was not injured, steered the car off the road. Harris died at the scene.
The boy who jumped was taken to the hospital with life-threatening injuries. Police are investigating the incident as a suicide attempt.
I-66 between Nutley Street and Gallows road was closed for several hours while police investigated the incident.
Below is the area where the crash happened.
This story was updated to reflect new information from the Virginia State Police.

A massive fire has erupted in Orlando, Florida – a city still rattled by Sunday's mass shooting at a gay nightclub.
Construction materials caught fire on International Drive, just north of Walt Disney World, reported Orlando's My News 13, citing the Orlando fire department.

However, the blaze appears to be at an off-site construction area, used to store water slides for Volcano Bay, a water park that is planned as an addition to the Universal Orlando Resort, reported the local news portal Orlando United.
The fire has been put out, the Orlando FD reported shortly after 3 p.m. local time. Eight units responded to the incident, and there were no injuries.
Riley's heart was pounding.
She stood still, basking in schadenfreude. That look of shock and fear on Shane's face as he clutched his newly-bruised cheek…she absolutely savoured it. What she wouldn't give to have a picture of this…but no, taking out her phone now would ruin her momentum.
All term—all frackin' term—the boy had picked on her relentlessly. Mercilessly. And now, when she finally had the nerve to fight back, it turned out he couldn't even take one little punch to his stupid little face. Wimp.
Well too bad for him, because no way in hell was she gonna stop now. Her eyes narrowed. Her lips turned up into a malicious grin.
It's payback time.
-~-
“OH YEAH!” Anger's voice rang out across Headquarters. “IT'S PAYBACK TIME!!!”
He reached for the lever that would start the party, ignoring the quiet sob coming from the side of the room in response to his words.
The source of the sound had been Sadness, of course. Tears trailed down her cheeks from her closed eyes, and her arms were wrapped around her torso as if she was literally holding herself together. Beside her, Disgust sat with arms and legs crossed. She looked at the wall right in front of her face rather than the control panel and viewing screen, unable to stomach the proceedings. On Sadness' other side, Fear was curled up in the foetal position, trembling.
Joy's eyes were the only ones who paid attention, and they were heavy with resignation. Sitting with her back to the wall, Joy looked tired, as if she wouldn't have been able to muster the energy to stand if her life depended on it, and yet she was still making an effort to console Sadness while simultaneously cradling her own injured arm.
Anger pushed the lever.
-~-
A small part of Riley noticed that she had drawn a crowd—not surprising given the level of traffic passing them in the halls. Good, she thought, Shane'll be even MORE humiliated this way. She abruptly raised her fist, and felt another stab of perverse pleasure as Shane flinched away…
And Riley stopped.
-~-
Anger was having a hard time processing what his senses were telling him.
The lever wasn't moving.
When he had pushed it, it had gone three quarters of the way up without a problem, and then just…stopped. He pushed again, and again, and the lever stubbornly refused to move any further.
As his efforts continued to fail to produce results, he began to open and close his mouth as if to speak, but no sound came out. There were no words for this; nothing like it had ever happened before. It was…it was…
-~-
Riley's fist was trembling.
She stood still, teeth clenched, glaring at Shane, who was waiting for the hammer blow of her punch. And she didn't strike.
She wanted to. Oh, how she wanted to. The desire surged through every fiber of her being, screaming at her to do it; refraining felt fundamentally wrong somehow. She wants want want wanted it.
She closed her eyes, took a deep breath, and held it.
-~-
If Anger thought his eyes were deceiving him before, he was nearly certain of it now. That was the only rational explanation for this.
As he began sputtering wordlessly in apoplectic rage, Joy gasped. At the sound, Sadness went silent, and Fear's trembling subsided but for the occasional twitch. Disgust risked a glance in Anger's direction, which became a stare of stunned disbelief to match Joy's.
For she could quite clearly see that, despite Anger trying as hard as he could to push the lever upwards, it was slowly but inexorably moving down.
On its own.
-~-
One, Riley counted, ignoring the few audience members egging her on. Two, THREE.
And with an effort that made her feel like she was deliberately cutting off one of her own fingers, she turned away, lowering her fist and letting out her breath in a huff.
-~-
The lever slammed itself the rest of the way down, violently enough to throw Anger to the floor.
Joy's mouth fell open. Disgust's eyes looked as though they were about to pop out of her skull. Sadness, with much trepidation, turned and looked at Anger uncomprehendingly.
-~-
NO, Riley told herself firmly. THIS…
-~-
From his position on the floor, Anger's eyes were fixed on the lever as he tried and failed to make sense of the past few seconds.
A few paces behind him, a secret compartment in the ceiling opened up and a robotic hand emerged. Joy's eyes snapped to it immediately, opening even wider than Disgust's.
Wh- What?! she thought. Since when do we have something like that?!
-~-
…IS NOT… Riley continued.
-~-
The robotic arm swooped down and picked up Anger by the back of his shirt, which caused him to start flailing wildly. Joy staggered to her feet, struggling to push back her fatigue, but she hesitated to intervene.
-~-
…WHO…
-~-
“Gyaaaaaah!”
Anger was whisked backwards towards a cage that had just emerged from another secret compartment, this one in the wall. Then he was unceremoniously dumped inside.
“Hey…what…?” His eyes were wide as he spun, looking frantically for a way out.
Joy stumbled towards him. She didn't know what she would do when she reached the cage, but…
-~-
…I AM.
-~-
Joy was about halfway to the cage when the floor under it disappeared, dropping Anger into darkness.
“AAAAAAAAAAARRRGH!!!”
-~-
Riley opened her eyes.
I am better than this, she declared. I'm not like him. I won't sink to his level.
-~-
There was stunned silence in Headquarters.
-~-
Riley wasn't quite sure what she had just done, but she knew it felt good.
Well, maybe not good, exactly. More like, satisfying. Calming.
Calm. Yes, that's how she felt. Calm, focused, centred. Zen-like, even. Her head was breathtakingly clear, her thoughts sharp.
Wow. I hope this doesn't wear off, or if it do I hope I can do it again. I feel like I could write super-important tests back-to-back all day and still be just as relaxed at the end of it as I am now.
She glanced back at Shane, who was now looking at her with a rather confused hope, and asked herself whether she still wanted revenge on him.
Why bother? came the answer. Waste of time.
Cool, she responded. Wouldn't want to be late for class anyway. Then she stopped talking to herself, because that was weird.
She looked around at the crowd, and asked, completely nonchalant, “Could someone please take this guy to the nurse?”
Without waiting to see their reaction, she pushed through them and walked away.
As Riley weaved through the bodies that filled the halls, she continued reflecting on her newly-achieved mental state, growing more confident by the second. Yes, she realized, I am more than my emotions. I'm not just any old animal. I'm human, and it's time I started acting like it. Move over, limbic system; my prefrontal cortex is in the driver's seat now.
She allowed herself to feel enough amusement from that thought to turn her lips up into a wry smile, before realizing what she'd just done.
I reflexively intercept emotional responses before I even feel them? Fascinating.
Suddenly, she was reminded of a certain pointy-eared fictional character who had a habit of saying that.
Huh. I was never really a fan before, but I guess that guy was on to something after all. I'll have to look into that when I get home. She took out her phone and made a note to that effect, then continued on.
She suspected that she would be sentenced to detention for punching Shane, but she would bear it in calm silence; making a fuss would accomplish nothing except wasting even more of her time. It was not a punishment she expected to recur, since if Shane had not already been intimidated out of further harassment, her newfound ability to effortlessly shrug it off would certainly cause him to lose interest quickly.
Her smile widened. This, she decided, has been a very good day.

The proud lion of Sweden's Nordic Battlegroup's coat of arms has been emasculated because a group of female soldiers lodged a complaint with the European Court of Justice.
Christian Braunstein, from the Tradition Commission of the Swedish Army, said: "We were forced to cut the lion's willy off with the aid of a computer."
Although the army was happy to make the changes in the interests of gender equality, the artist who designed the insignia was less than pleased.
"A heraldic lion is a powerful and stately figure with its genitalia intact and I cannot approve an edited image.
"The army lacks knowledge about heraldry. Once upon a time coats of arms containing lions without genitalia were given to those who betrayed the Crown." Vladimir Sagerlund told the Göteborgs-Posten.
In the contest of the league's two carnival clubs, 1. FC Köln and 1. FSV Mainz 05 played out a goalless draw at the RheinEnergieSTADION on Matchday 13.
1. FC Köln 0-0 FSV Mainz 05
Köln's start to the carnival season could barely have begun better than with a derby win over neighbours Bayer 04 Leverkusen a fortnight ago, but they found it tough going against a well-drilled Mainz side in the first half. The hosts had some joy in wide positions but their final ball lacked quality, and it was Mainz that came the closest through the in-form Yunus Malli's snap-shot and Japan international Yoshinori Muto's header over the bar.
Peter Stöger's men started the second period on the front foot, and Anthony Modeste was inches away from his seventh of the season when his low drive struck the post. Thereafter, however, neither side managed to create much in the way of chances, and Leonardo Bittencourt's miss from five yards – albeit from an offside position – rather summed up the afternoon.
Man of the match
Dominic Maroh was the hero against Leverkusen with his two goals, but he stood out with a faultless display at the back here, commanding the Köln defence and enjoying the second-most touches in the side.
Talking point
As solid as their defence was, scoring goals is slowly becoming an issue for Stöger's side again. They managed just 34 in 34 matches last season and have scored just 15 in 13 games this term. Modeste, without a goal since Matchday 8, needs to find his shooting boots again sooner rather than later.
Match stats
The first shot of the game came in the 41st minute from Kevin Vogt.Timo Horn was called upon to make just one save in the entire 90 minutes.The Billy Goats have now failed to score in their last three home games.
Line-ups
Köln: Horn – Risse. Maroh, Heintz, Hector – Osako, Lehmann (c), Vogt, Bittencourt (Gerhardt 83') – Hosiner (Zoller 59'), Modeste
Mainz: Karius – Brosinski, Bungert, Bell, Bengtsson – Baumgartlinger, Latza – De Blasis (Clemens 85'), Malli (Niederlechner 90'), Jairo – Muto (Cordoba 68')
This morning, Uruguayan officials will open 18 envelopes. Each will contain a proposal to grow two tonnes of marijuana on up to five hectares of land for sale to the Uruguayan government.
Within a few days, up to five of the 18 bidders (one of whom is a Canadian) will be selected, and another part of Uruguay's experiment with legalizing and regulating marijuana will fall into place.
By regulating purchase and sale, Uruguay hopes to control the quality of marijuana, its use and distribution, and ultimately drive down consumption. The bidders knew in advance what profit level would be allowed, what kind of seed would be required, how the crop would be grown and how much the government felt it required.

The rest of Latin America, where the drug trade in all its manifestations is a scourge, is watching – as are people in far-off places such as Canada, where political parties have dived into the issue with loose talk and little reflection.
The Liberal Party has recommended legalizing marijuana. It did so in a particularly, and perhaps tellingly, slap-dash manner: a speech by Leader Justin Trudeau and a resolution at a convention. Neither showed that the leader nor the party had thought seriously about the issue. No major policy paper was unveiled to illustrate that the leader and the party had thought deeply about the issue.
Predictably, the Conservatives climbed all over the issue, running party television ads mocking Mr. Trudeau's support for legalization. As they often do, the Conservatives even used government money to buy television ad time during the Grey Cup warning against marijuana use, a not-so-thinly-disguised partisan message. So the issue of legalizing marijuana is joined, if not fairly or intelligently.
In Uruguay, legalization and regulation are being politically sold as a public health measure in a country where state intervention to discourage "social harm" has deep roots.
Advocates call the policy part of the "right to health," an argument that has scarcely been framed this way in Canada, although it would not be hard to imagine in such a "rights" conscious society as Canada that this kind of framing might happen.
The roots of regulation against "social harm" in Uruguay extends even to restaurants, where salt is not on the table, its use being deemed harmful to health. Patrons can get salt only by asking for it.
The new Uruguayan law emphasizes promotion of information and education about the use of tobacco and marijuana. Educational policies in primary, secondary and vocational schools will inform students about the "potential damage" of drug consumption, including cannabis.

And, of course, all advertising and other forms of public promotion of marijuana will be prohibited. No one under 18 can buy marijuana from the state supplies, nor grow it in their places of residence.
Urugruay's marijuana politics may be instructive for Canada. Polls showed a majority of the Uruguayan population against the idea, but public opinion is now shifting to a somewhat more favourable position and the party that made the change just won the presidency and majorities in congress. In Canada, polls show a majority in favour.
Sebastian Sabini, a member of Uruguay's governing party, says that in his district, which contains urban and rural voters, resistance was highest in the countryside and among older people. That sounds exactly like the Conservative Party core in Canada: older and rural. Mr. Sabini said younger, urban voters were favourable – exactly the target audience of Mr. Trudeau's Liberals.
Mr. Sabini says the legalization issue was not the most important in the recent election. Jobs, the economy, social programs and crime drove voting intentions. Marijuana legalization and regulation came as part of a wave of social liberalization in Uruguay, which also included legalizing abortion and gay marriage.
Mandatory voting, by the way, is an electoral fixture in Uruguay. Anyone who fails to vote without a valid reason can be fined or denied government services.
In a country that is a major exporter (and consumer) of beef, perhaps the metaphor is only a bit corny that Uruguay has taken the bull by the horns in the battle against cannabis. It has accepted the inevitable – that cannabis will be and is being widely used – and is trying to regulate its production and use to reduce consumption and crime.
The Democratic Party of Wisconsin is now officially backing a citizen-led recall campaign against eight Republican state senators. The page announcing their support for the campaign, which is also a donation page to the Wisconsin Democratic Party, can be found here.
Greg Sargent interviews the chair of the Wisconsin Democratic Party about this development:
The Wisconsin Democratic Party has decided to throw its weight behind a nascent grassroots drive to recall a number of GOP state senators, a move that will considerably increase the pressure on them to break with Governor Scott Walker, the Dem party chair confirms to me. "The proposals and the policies that Republicans are pushing right now are not what they campaigned on, and they're extreme," the party chair, Mike Tate, said in an interview. "Something needs to be done about it now. We're happy to stand with citizens who are filling papers to recall these senators."
We are going to be supporting the recall campaign. If you live in Wisconsin, sign up with SEIU and Daily Kos to help gather the necessary signatures.
As this story develops, we will have more on other ways you can help the recall effort. On Wisconsin!
The Post-Bloomberg debate was the most substantive and well-behaved of the Republican presidential debates to date. Although I was skeptical of a single debate topic (the economy), it did help to focus the contenders and separate the good from the bad from the ugly performances.
Certainly, Mitt Romney has to be very pleased. He was smooth as silk, deflecting a question on RomneyCare, explaining the problems of community banks, and driving home the key message: He is the only candidate ready for prime time. He amped up the populism, continuing on his China currency crusade and tweaking the Texas governor for the huge number of uninsured residents.He also scored a point on national security, telling the audience that defense cuts were a really bad idea. More importantly, he didn't need to dismantle Herman Cain. That happened at Cain's own hands with some help from Rep. Ron Paul (R-Tex.), Rick Santorum and Rep. Michele Bachmann (R-Minn.) He managed to drop New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie's name, reminding voters and press alike that this may have been his best day in the race. He even managed to get in a dig at PBS when host Charlie Rose accidentally put Santorum ahead of Romney in the alphabetical line-up for questioning other candidates. His best moment may have been in explaining his Bain experience, creating tens of thousands of net jobs and making Sports Authority, Staples and even a steel mill viable employers. If not an inside the park homerun, it was at least a stand-up triple.
Gov. Rick Perry looked sleepy for much of the debate. He seemed to have one answer for everything: energy. He didn't have his economic plan ready to go so all he could do was stall. He got skewered by moderator and Post reporter Karen Tumulty on his crony capitalism, saying states should have the right to do these things unlike the feds and pleading that not all the people who got money were donors. There were other disasters as well. At one point he peevishly said, “We don't need to focus on this policy or that policy. We need to get America working again.” Ooof. At moments it looked like he simply wanted to get out of there. And perhaps after Iowa, he will get his chance to do just that. In short, Perry struck out looking.
Surprisingly, Herman Cain had a bad outing as well. It was so bad, even Ron Paul scored a point by deriding Cain's praise of former Fed chairman Alan Greenspan. Ooof. He seemed under-prepared to answer attacks on his 9-9-9 plan. Santorum smartly used the audience to show a complete lack of support for a sales tax and unanimous disbelief that the rates would stay at 9-9-9. Cain tried to belittle Romney's 59-point plan; That only gave Romney an opening to tell him “simple” doesn't mean effective. And Bachmann scored points again telling Cain, “It's a tax plan. Not a jobs plan.” Cain looked knocked off his game, and will no doubt give fodder to opponents who say he is naive about the ways of Washington and unprepared to deal with Beltway lawmakers. And to top it off, he inexplicably threw Romney a lifeline saying he agreed with Romney who supported TARP but faulted its implementation. Score that as thrown out trying to stretch a single into a double.
On the positive side, Bachmann had her best outing since the early debates. She was measured and informed in tracing the financial crisis to Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae policies. She also dissected the Independent Patient Advisory Board and the Obama Medicare cuts, arguing that the bureaucracy shouldn't be empowered to make one-size fits all for elderly, sick patients. If Perry collapses entirely and Cain ticks downward, she could well be the beneficiary in the critical state of Iowa. She trotted into second base on this performance.
Santorum also had one of his best outings. He derided 9-9-9. He reached out to social conservatives at the end, making the point that intact families are essential to preventing poverty. He showed a lighter tone as well, tamping down on his telltale intensity that can come across as excessively angry. He also pitched his message to middle income voters, stressing the need to bring back manufacturing to the country. He took a swipe at Cain, saying industrial state Democrats would support Santorum's plan but Cain's 9-9-9 scheme wouldn't pass. He got to first base, in this one and is threatening to steal second.
Jon Huntsman will be remembered for a cringe-inducing reference to the Pastor Robert Jeffress incident. Paul finally made a well-supported point on the inanity of holding up Greenspan as a model Fed chairman. Newt Gingrich went around the bend, threatening to lock up former Sen. Chris Dodd and Rep. Barney Frank (D-Mass.)
In not getting bruised and by demonstrating his superior campaign skills, Romney came out the big winner. Perry didn't help himself a bit, and now risks slipping behind Bachmann and others. Bachmann brought her A game, but now will have to translate that to fundraising and support in Iowa. And Santorum seems ready to move up as others fail. This was, most of all, Cain's big moment. He didn't maximize his opportunity, and instead likely increased doubts about his preparedness to run for and be president. Much can change between now and January, but unless other candidates change the dynamics of the race, Romney will slowly but surely move to lock up the nomination.

Donald Richie, a prominent American critic and writer on Japan who helped introduce much of the English-speaking world to the golden age of Japanese cinema in 1959 and recounted his expatriate life there spanning seven decades, died on Tuesday in Tokyo. He was 88.
His death was confirmed by Christopher Blasdel, a friend.
Mr. Richie wrote prolifically, not just on film and culture in Japan but also on his own travels and experiences there. He won recognition for his soul-baring descriptions of a Westerner's life in an impenetrable but permissive society that held him politely at arm's length while allowing him to explore it nonetheless, from its classical arts to its seedy demimonde.
Openly bisexual, Mr. Richie also wrote frankly about his lovers, both male and female, saying Japan's greater tolerance of homosexuality in the 1940s, relative to that in the United States, was one reason he returned to the country after graduating from Columbia University in 1953. Mr. Richie first saw Tokyo as a bombed-out ruin, arriving in 1947 as a 22-year-old typist with the Allied Occupation forces after serving on transport ships during the war. He spent most of the next 66 years in Tokyo, gaining a following among Western readers for textured descriptions of Japan and its people that transcended Western stereotypes.
“I remain in a state of surprise, and this leads to heightened interest and hence perception,” Mr. Richie wrote in his diary in 1947, describing the thrill of living abroad. “Like a child with a puzzle, I am forever putting pieces together and saying: Of course.”
Bernanke and the Fed have to be miffed over their lack of traction in addressing the credit bubble.
Of course if Bernanke understood simple economics as explained in Impossible To Get Something For Nothing, he would not be doing the silly things he is doing such as running out of letters in his alphabet soup of lending facilities.
Today we see yet another lending facility and fittingly enough it is called the MMIFF. Inquiring minds are reading the Fed's Press Release On the MMIFF.
The Federal Reserve Board on Tuesday announced the creation of the Money Market Investor Funding Facility (MMIFF), which will support a private-sector initiative designed to provide liquidity to U.S. money market investors.
Under the MMIFF, authorized by the Board under Section 13(3) of the Federal Reserve Act, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York (FRBNY) will provide senior secured funding to a series of special purpose vehicles to facilitate an industry-supported private-sector initiative to finance the purchase of eligible assets from eligible investors. Eligible assets will include U.S. dollar-denominated certificates of deposit and commercial paper issued by highly rated financial institutions and having remaining maturities of 90 days or less. Eligible investors will include U.S. money market mutual funds and over time may include other U.S. money market investors.
The MMIFF complements the previously announced Commercial Paper Funding Facility (CPFF), which on October 27, 2008 will begin funding purchases of highly rated, U.S.-dollar denominated, three-month, unsecured and asset-backed commercial paper issued by U.S. issuers, as well as the Asset Backed Commercial Paper Money Market Mutual Fund Liquidity Facility (AMLF), announced on September 19, 2008, which extends loans to banking organizations to purchase asset backed commercial paper from money market mutual funds. The AMLF, CPFF, and MMIFF are all intended to improve liquidity in short-term debt markets and thereby increase the availability of credit.
Got That?
The MMIFF is intended to help restore liquidity to the money markets. The MMIFF will be a credit facility provided by the Federal Reserve to a series of special purpose vehicles established by the private sector (PSPVs) in accordance with the terms described below. Each PSPV will purchase eligible money market instruments from eligible investors using financing from the MMIFF and from the issuance of asset-backed commercial paper (ABCP). The MMIFF is authorized under section 13(3) of the Federal Reserve Act.
Eligible Assets of a PSPV
A PSPV will purchase from eligible investors at amortized cost U.S. dollar-denominated certificates of deposit, banknotes, and commercial paper with remaining maturity of 90 days or less. Each PSPV will only purchase debt instruments issued by ten financial institutions designated in its operational documents. Each of these financial institutions will have a short-term debt rating of at least A-1/P-1/F1 from two or more major nationally recognized statistical rating organizations (NRSROs).
PSPV Concentration Limit
At the time of a PSPV's purchase of a debt instrument issued by a financial institution, the debt instruments of that financial institution may not constitute more than 15 percent of the assets of the PSPV.
Liabilities of a PSPV
Each PSPV will finance its purchase of an eligible asset by selling ABCP and by borrowing under the MMIFF. The PSPV will issue to the seller of the eligible asset ABCP equal to 10 percent of the asset's purchase price. The ABCP will have a maturity equal to the maturity of the asset and will be rated at least A-1/P-1/F1 by two or more major NRSROs. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York (FRBNY) will commit to lend to each PSPV 90 percent of the purchase price of each eligible asset until the maturity of the asset. The FRBNY loans will be on an overnight basis and at the primary credit rate. The loans will be senior to the ABCP, with recourse to the PSPV, and secured by all the assets of the PSPV.
Downgrade or Default of an Eligible Asset
If the debt instruments of a financial institution held by a PSPV are no longer eligible assets due to a short-term debt rating downgrade, the PSPV must cease all asset purchases until all of the PSPV's assets issued by that financial institution have matured.
Upon a default of any asset held by a PSPV, the PSPV must cease all asset purchases and repayments on outstanding ABCP. Proceeds from maturation of the PSPV's assets will be used to repay the FRBNY and, upon maturation of all assets in the PSPV, any remaining available cash will then be used to repay principal and interest on the ABCP. Any excess spread will be allocated as described below.
Head Spinning Yet?
Fed to Provide Up to $540 Billion to Aid Money Funds
The Federal Reserve will provide up to $540 billion in loans to help relieve pressure on money-market mutual funds beset by redemptions.
"Short-term debt markets have been under considerable strain in recent weeks" as it got tougher for funds to meet withdrawal requests, the Fed said today in a statement in Washington. A Fed official said that about $500 billion has flowed since August out of prime money-market funds, which with other money-market mutual funds control $3.45 trillion.
The initiative is the third government effort to aid the funds, which usually provide a key source of financing for banks and companies.
"The problem was much worse than we thought," Jim Bianco, president of Chicago-based Bianco Research LLC, said in a Bloomberg Television interview. policymakers are trying to prevent "Great Depression II" by stemming the financial industry's contraction, he said.
JPMorgan Chase & Co. will run five special units that will buy up to $600 billion of certificates of deposit, banknotes and commercial paper with remaining maturity of 90 days or less. The Fed will provide up to $540 billion, with the remaining $60 billion coming from commercial paper issued by the five units to the money-market funds selling their assets, central bank officials told reporters on a conference call.
The new program is called the Money Market Investor Funding Facility, and officials said it's intended as a backstop for money-market mutual funds to use as needed to meet redemptions.
NISKU, Alberta — Police arriving at a car crash in western Canada found five naked people inside, and ended up accusing them of kidnapping a mother, her father and her baby.
Royal Canadian Mounted Police Cpl. Laurel Scott said the mother, baby and the woman's father had been taken from a home and forced into a vehicle against their will. While the car was being driven, the adult male, who was in the trunk, managed to escape. Shortly after that the woman escaped with the baby.
Authorities said a passer-by offered assistance and secured all three in his truck before the suspects' vehicle rammed the rear of the truck and ended up in the ditch.
Three adults among the suspects remained in custody facing charges of kidnapping and resisting arrest, police said. The other two suspects were youths and released without charges.
Officials said the three people who were kidnapped were not injured.
The investigation continued but officials believed drugs or alcohol might have been a factor.
Associated Press writer Rob Gillies in Toronto contributed to this report.
Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan warned Sunday that protesters will "pay a price" if they continue the mass demonstrations that have consumed the country over the past two weeks.
Erdoğan told a crowd of thousands of his supporters in Ankara, "Those who do not respect this nation's party in power will pay a price. We remained patient, we are still patient but there's a limit to our patience."
The heavy police crackdown of the protest movement—which began as a peaceful demonstration to protect Istanbul's last public green space—has lead to over 5,000 injuries and two protester deaths throughout the course of the two week uprising.
Erdoğan held six rallies on Sunday, "a measure of tensions after a week of the biggest protests of his decade in power," as Reuters reports, in which he called the demonstrators “terrorists” and “anarchists." Erdoğan praised the officers he called “my police."
Bloomberg reports:

As Erdoğan's bus inched through the capital amid crowds cheering and waving flags, footage on CNN Turk and other channels showed police using tear gas and water cannons to drive demonstrators out of the Kizilay Square district in the city's center. A few minutes earlier, Erdoğan had urged protesters to withdraw.
Protesters, however, remained steadfast in dozens of towns across Turkey throughout the weekend, leading into Monday morning.
"We want life on the square to return to normal," said Eyup Muhcu, head of the Chamber of Architects and part of the Taksim Solidarity Platform. "We are ready for dialogue...but the prime minister's remarks indicate he is not open to dialogue."

Paul Feig has had enough of the Ghostbusters hate on Twitter, and he really can't be blamed. Reactions to his all-female reboot have been hateful and misogynistic at their worst, but Feig gives the best advice: “just let the movie happen.”
Sure, we're just as guilty as anyone at judging movies and TV shows negatively before we see them, and the current media culture of months of promotional pics and drips of information only makes it easier to create our own vision of what might be coming rather than what actually is coming. But there's also a difference between harmless speculation and harassing the film or TV creators on social media, or spending all of one's time spewing negativity.
Feig fired back at some of his online critics succinctly and with some vitriol of his own, although mostly he just sounds fed up. What we know for sure is that Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd, Ernie Hudson, Sigourney Weaver and Annie Potts are all on board with the reboot, and are planning cameos. It's all going to be ok.

Learn How to Pack a Suit Like a Road Warrior
How To Fold Your Suit to Avoid Wrinkles Traveling
Traveling with your suit can be an unavoidable fact of life for some men. Often, this comes with facing the frustrations of figuring out how to pack a suit so that it looks just as good as it did before you checked your bag. As suit connoisseurs, we can relate, and you're not alone. Many, many men look for answers to solve this problem, our customers included, like Jason.L who asks, “I'm wondering how to pack a suit in a suitcase without it looking like wrinkled tissue paper when I get to my hotel.”
Let's be honest, there are enough problems to face while traveling, so let's make this one easy. Learning how to pack a suit is simple, that is, once you have the folding part down. We've broken down how we fold our suits for travel into an easy, four-step process.
The 4 Steps to Easily Pack a Suit
Step 1
The first step to packing a suit begins while holding the suit jacket upright. With the jacket at attention, pop in one of the shoulders and pull it inside-out as seen below (some choose to pull the entire sleeve inside out as well, but this is not necessary).
Step 2:
After that, you will want to fold in the opposite shoulder into the one previously popped inside-out until the entire length of the lapel is lined up nicely. Understanding how to pack a suit means realizing that in order to work with a small space like a suitcase, these alignments need to be clean, so make sure the lapel is, indeed, lined up.
Step 3:
Then, fold the suit jacket vertically so that everything is lined up to the width of one shoulder. Again, make sure that when you're folding your suit for travel that these alignments are perfect in order to mitigate wrinkles.
Step 4:
The last step when folding your suit jacket for travel is to fold the jacket horizontally in half so that the top of the shoulders is lined up with the bottom edge of the jacket. After that, all you need to do is simply place your suit jacket inside whatever container you're using to travel!
Good to Go!
There you have it, you now know how to pack a suit with the correct folding technique! That's how to pack a suit in a suitcase Black Lapel style. The suit jacket is now ready to pack. Fold your pants along the crease and your suit should come out looking just as fresh at your destination as it did at your departure! Incidentally, this is also how your suit arrives fresh out of the Black Lapel box.
A Final Note About Packing a Suit
No matter how well you master folding your suit the way we've shown, you may still have slight wrinkles in your suit jacket when you arrive at your destination. No matter, as there are easy ways to solve any slight wrinkling (if any occurred). The simplest way is to hang your suit jacket in your bathroom while you're running the shower, allowing the steam trapped inside the bathroom to correct any leftover wrinkles you may have.

After months of infighting, Capt Amarinder Singh replaces Partap Singh Bajwa as Punjab Congress chief. The two leaders talk about their plans and each other in separate interviews.

As soon as you were appointed, party workers as well as people of the state broke into revelry. How do you hope to meet the expectations that so many people have of you?
I received 2,000 telephone calls, 6,000 messages on WhatsApp and 700 SMSes, while 3.5 lakh people congratulated me on Facebook where I got 12,000 likes. I am overwhelmed by such support. I will try my best to meet their expectations. I have the advantage of 47 years' experience in politics and five years as a chief minister. If voted to power, I will start from day one. We will resolve farmers' issues, get experts to provide new cropping patterns so that agriculture becomes a viable option again and farmers are not driven to suicide. We will find ways to fill the state's coffers and create jobs.

What will your priorities be once you take over as Punjab PCC chief?
The biggest problem in the state currently is unrest. Since 70 per cent of our population are below 40, unemployment is a strong reason for creating unrest and drives youths to drugs. When Rahul Gandhi came to Punjab and we were talking to youth, I was told unemployment is the biggest problem. I will engage with them, learn about their expectations and work towards finding solutions. They are without jobs as our industry has taken flight, real estate is no more profitable and we are not getting new players in industry. If we are elected, we will address all these issues besides the empty coffers by getting more industries in the state.
Is AAP a threat to the Congress in Punjab? Especially when Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal is expected to come to the state to campaign?
The people cannot take the risk of AAP, a party of inexperienced people. Even if he should come as a CM candidate who would hand over Delhi to his deputy, people would not want him. Who wants a Haryanvi in Punjab when all our issues are with Haryana? We have an issue of water sharing, territory with Haryana. He is not going to sell in Punjab. He can campaign as much as he is like. He was with Anna Hazare earlier, vowed they would not get into politics. Now, he has failed in Delhi and blaming the Union government for all his failures. He has not been able even to address garbage issues.
Deputy Chief Minister Sukhbir Singh Badal has alleged that you engage in the politics of confrontation.
I am not a confrontationist. He is the one who has challenged me to hold a sizeable rally in Bathinda. He is just indulging in politics. There are bigger issues that need attention in Punjab.
The youth could be AAP's route to power. How will you win them over?
I will go and interact with them in universities and colleges and see what they demand and what we have to offer. I did the same at Khalsa College in Amritsar. We got huge support from them. Even in the Amritsar Lok Sabha election, they supported us. People in Punjab have a lot of affection for me. I will not let them down.
You have been criticised in the past as a leader who allegedly works through coteries. Do you agree?
They use the wrong word for my team. I have a strong team, which is my sounding board. All the decisions have always been mine. I have been open to every sort of advice from my party. I talk to professors, intellectuals and everybody who can give me suggestions. I am accessible.
There are concerns about your health.
I have no problem with my health, just that I am a diabetic. I keep it under control. It is not a problem.
Your predecessor faced his first revolt when he reorganised the PPCC. How will you handle something similar?
Whenever a president goes, the unit has to be reorganised. I will take everybody together. I have already spoken to Bajwa and invited him to the Bathinda rally, where I will officially take over as PCC president. He has agreed to come.
Are you satisfied with the way you have been handed over the reins of the party when others too have been named office-bearers?

I have no issues with Lal Singh as he has been my friend. The same with Ambika Soni. We will all work together.
Joe Raedle/Getty Images Photographs of Democratic presidential candidates hang on their lecterns in Las Vegas before the party's first primary debate. A new HuffPost/YouGov poll finds that most Democratic voters don't expect the debate to change their minds.
The trio of low-polling candidates hoping Tuesday night's debate will help them make their case to Democratic voters face an uphill challenge -- in a new HuffPost/YouGov poll, most potential viewers say they're unlikely to change their opinions about the campaign after watching the first debate.
Most voters agree that debates are important in theory, and many are planning to watch. Fifty-seven percent of registered Democrats agree that primary debates are a good way to get to know the candidates. About one-third of registered Democratic voters say they're excited to watch Tuesday's debate, and another 38 percent say they're not excited but may end up tuning in anyway. Just 21 percent say they probably or definitely won't watch.
Still, 54 percent of the voters who are considering watching expect the debate to mostly confirm what they already think about the candidates, while just 30 percent believe there's a chance it will change their views. A 57 percent majority of all Democratic voters say they have at least a good idea of who they'll vote for.
That doesn't mean they can't or won't change their minds before next year's primaries, as Hillary Clinton's narrowing lead has shown. About 35 percent of Democratic primary voters now say they've made up their minds and want to see Clinton nominated, down nearly 10 points since August; another 9 percent say they're still making up their minds, but would prefer to see her as the Democratic nominee. Eighteen percent now say they've decided to throw their support behind a different candidate, while 13 percent are still deciding, but would rather see an alternative to Clinton. The remainder aren't sure about either their candidate preference or how firm it is.
Huffington Post
That leaves Clinton with a plurality of support for now, even when pitted against the rest of the Democratic field. And, as other surveys have shown, the campaign has remained relatively stable so far, with Clinton, Bernie Sanders and Joe Biden -- who has not yet announced whether he'll run -- largely holding on to their supporters over the summer.
With months until the first votes are cast, there's plenty of time for things to change, but few expect Tuesday's event to be the catalyst. In the HuffPost/YouGov poll, a majority of both Clinton supporters and Clinton opponents say they're unlikely to change their minds because of the debate.
The HuffPost/YouGov poll consisted of 1,000 completed interviews conducted Oct. 7-9 among U.S. adults, using a sample selected from YouGov's opt-in online panel to match the demographics and other characteristics of the adult U.S. population.
The Huffington Post has teamed up with YouGov to conduct daily opinion polls. You can learn more about this project and take part in YouGov's nationally representative opinion polling. Data from all HuffPost/YouGov polls can be found here. More details on the polls' methodology are available here.
Most surveys report a margin of error that represents some, but not all, potential survey errors. YouGov's reports include a model-based margin of error, which rests on a specific set of statistical assumptions about the selected sample, rather than the standard methodology for random probability sampling. If these assumptions are wrong, the model-based margin of error may also be inaccurate. Click here for a more detailed explanation of the model-based margin of error.

The Hyperloop is billed as a cheaper, faster alternative to high-speed rail or airplanes: levitating pods sucked through low-pressure tubes at nearly the speed of sound.
This could well be an early manifestation of Elon Musk's sci-fi vision for the Hyperloop proposed in 2013. As per Musk's ‘Hyperloop', getting from London to Edinburgh or Los Angeles (LA) to San Francisco could take as less than 30 minutes.
The Hyperloop is billed as a cheaper, faster alternative to high-speed rail or airplanes: levitating pods sucked through low-pressure tubes at nearly the speed of sound. The concept is now inching closer to reality. Recently, Hyperloop One—a well-funded, slightly dysfunctional, futuristic transportation start-up based in the US—said that it would study the possibility of building the world's first passenger-ready Hyperloop in Dubai.
Just picture this. It's 2021, you're in Dubai, and you need to get to Abu Dhabi, roughly 100 miles away, so you bring up an app on your phone. A few minutes later, a self-driving pod pulls up at your door, brings you to a ‘portal'. At the portal, your pod docks together in a transporter with other pods carrying more passengers or maybe cargo. Then they are fed into a vacuum-sealed tube, where you'll zip along at hundreds of miles per hour to your destination. When you get to Abu Dhabi, the pod undocks and drives you directly to your destination. Door to door, the trip takes about 15 minutes.
The combination of an on-demand, autonomous transportation service with faster-than-a-jet speeds between cities is another sign that Hyperloop One will continue to ratchet up expectations in its quest to upend the world of freight and public transportation.
But this fantastical vision of the world won't come cheap: leaked documents from the company recently obtained by Forbes show the cost of building the hyperloop vastly exceed the vision of the original architect, billionaire Musk. The route between Dubai and Abu Dhabi would cost $4.8 billion, or $52 million a mile. Musk's original concept in 2013 was an $11.5 million-per-mile hyperloop.
The UAE is staking a lot of money, resources, and reputation on Hyperloop One's success. The feasibility study will be conducted by McKinsey & Co and Bjarke Ingels Group, and paid for by the Dubai Roads and Transport Authority (RTA). The oil-rich kingdom is also an investor in Hyperloop One, helping to contribute to the company's latest $50 million fund-raising round.
Hyperloop One is racing another start-up, Hyperloop Transportation Technologies, to try to turn the concept into reality. However, the LA-based Hyperloop Transportation Technologies is yet to conduct any public demonstrations. Hyperloop One, on the other hand, has feasibility studies underway in Finland and Sweden, the Netherlands, Switzerland, Moscow, the Port of Los Angeles and the UK.
Hyperloop One's first open-air test in the Nevada desert in May featured a metal sled shooting down a train track at a little more than 100 mph. As per reports, it also plans to show off the full-scale prototype it's building in Nevada in 2017.
Also in January next year, Elon Musk's SpaceX will host a public test in California featuring Hyperloop pods built by over a dozen high school and college engineering teams. In other words, the Hyperloop is in for a very busy 2017.
Volunteers of the international community InformNapalm have collected information from open sources that proves the presence of Russian servicemen of the 15th Separate Motorized Rifle Brigade of peacekeeping forces in the occupied territory of Ukraine. The presence of servicemen from this brigade might be an evidence of the Kremlin's plans to further escalate the conflict in Donbas and to legalize its “peacekeepers” after enlarging the occupied zone.
During a monitoring of social networks, InformNapalm investigators came across a Russian contract soldier assigned to one of the illegal military formation of “Novorossiya” that operate in Ukraine in the interest of Russia. The following information about the soldier has been collected.
Sergeant Anatoliy Konstantinovich Kashyrtsev is 24 years old (his date of birth, presumably, is August 26, 1992), was born in the village of Kvitok, Tayshetsky District, Irkutsk Oblast, Russia. He uses a call sign “Motey“; however, it did not prevent us from identifying him. He was born into a family with military traditions: his father is Konstantin Kashyrtsev, a former midshipman of the Russian Pacific Fleet, presumably served on a surface-to-surface missile cruiser Variag; his brother is Vladimir Kashyrtsev, an officer of the Russian armed forces, serves in the Russian Far East.
In 2013-2014, Anatoliy Kashyrtsev served as a conscript in the 649th Regiment of the 60th Rocket Division of the Russian Strategic Missile Forces (military unit 93412, town of Svetly, Tatishchevsky District, Saratov Oblast). During the service, he graduated from the communications training center. In 2014, he signed a service contract and in the rank of a sergeant was sent to the 15th Separate Motorized Rifle Brigade of peacekeeping forces (military unit 90600, Roshchinsky training range, Volzhsky District, Samara Oblast) of the Central Military District.
Since April of 2015, he has been in the illegal armed groups in Donbas. Here are his web pages in social networks: “VK” (archives of profile, photo album, contacts); “VK-2” (archives of profile, photo album); “OK-1“; “OK-2“; “OK-3“; “OK-4“.
Now, let's track a “service record” of Kashurtsev by using pictures that he posted on social media.
A serviceman of the 15th Separate Motorized Rifle Peacekeeping Brigade, fall-winter of 2014 in Roshchinsky garrison, Samara Oblast:
Military training before the deployment to Ukraine – February, 2015. Kashyrtsev and other servicemen of his brigade were trained for combat at a training range in Kazan Oblast.
A Ukrainian deployment of Sergeant Kashyrtsev started in April of 2015. He might be in Ukraine at the time when this article is being written.
Studying Kashyrtsev's social media friends provided some information about his comrades-in-arms from the same 15th Motorized Rifle Brigade – “veterans” of the war in Donbas and/or participants of the occupation operation in Crimea:
As it was noted in previous investigations by InformNapalm, starting in early spring of 2014, Russia began formation of a powerful main attack force. A number of battalion task groups and company task groups were formed using units of the four military districts of the Land Force, the Airborne Forces and the Coastal Defense of the Navy and relocated close to the Ukrainian border. The highest concentration of troops has been in Rostov Oblast, near the Ukrainian border. From there the shelling of the Ukrainian territory was conducted during the earlier period of the covert invasion and tactical units have been used for combat missions on a regular basis. Units of the 15th Motorized Rifle Brigade, which consisted of experienced contract soldiers, were in a vanguard of the invasion forces. The decrease of combat activities, as a result of the Minsk agreements, was used by the Russian military command to start building army corps of the “DPR” and “LPR”. Besides local collaborationists and Russian mercenaries, Russian active duty military and police joined secretly these corps. Now, most of Russian servicemen, sent to the illegal armed formations of “Novorossiya”, occupy the command positions or positions that require a special military training. This tendency has been in place since signing the Minsk agreements.
Earlier, the international volunteer community InformNapalm has already given multiple evidence of participation of “peacekeepers” from Samara – the 15th Motorized Rifle Brigade – in the war in Donbas. It allows us to conclude that Russia uses active duty military personnel in the war in Ukraine on a regular basis.
We recommend other investigations by our community that tell about servicemen of the 15th Motorized Rifle Brigade:

Tax showdown: Dante Atkins v. Mitt Romney
When Ted Nugent saw the title of this week's endeavor, he was momentarily excited. Until, that is, he found out that the last words were "class tax return" instead of "school girl." But I digress.
On April 17, millions of Americans found themselves relieved—not just of the burden of having to worry about tax returns for another year, but also of some of their money, which was due and payable to the Internal Revenue Service. Others, perhaps more fortunate, found themselves filing returns documenting the refunds owed to them. Tax policy has, of course, become a frequent public policy discussion recently: terms like "effective tax rate," "Buffett Rule," and "payroll tax extension" keep on being thrown around, and those of us with less familiarity than others may have a hard time understanding what it's all about. So in honor of tax day, I shall use my own tax return to document why progressive tax reform is exactly what we need right now. As a side benefit, I also get to have a head start on releasing my tax returns for when I run for president in 20 years (just kidding). And along the way, we get an answer to the question: who paid a higher share of his income in taxes? Dante Atkins, or Mitt Romney?
I'm what could be considered a typical middle-class taxpayer. Last year, I used a form 1040A to process my federal tax return. I use this form because my taxes are too complicated to use the much shorter 1040EZ, but not so complicated as to need the full form 1040. Last calendar year, I made a total of $49,500. Most of this income came from two jobs. In addition to that, I received a comparatively much smaller amount in what's called "non-employee compensation." What's the difference? Well, when you're a regular employee of a business, you automatically have income and payroll taxes deducted from your regular paycheck. When you're an independent contractor, you don't. That income is still taxable, but you just have to count on paying whatever taxes are owed when you file your return, as opposed to having it withheld for you by your employer. But the bottom line is, I had three "jobs"—which, in the words of George W. Bush, makes me uniquely American.
I'm just a renter, so I don't get to claim the types of mortgage-interest deductions that homeowners use to significantly lower their tax bills—I get to claim the so-called "standard deduction" that just about everybody gets, and that's about it. After factoring that in, the IRS said that for the year, I owed $5,256 in federal income taxes. Fortunately for me, my employers had withheld much more than that from my paychecks over the course of the year and sent it to the IRS on my behalf: a total of $6,074. This means that whenever the IRS gets around to processing my return—and provided I did all of my math correctly—I will end up receiving a refund of $818, and will end up having paid a hair over 10.6 percent of my income in federal taxes.
But that's not the end of the story—it could have been substantially higher. You see, during the course of the year, I had saved up enough to be able to contribute $3,500 to an Individual Retirement Account, or IRA for short. Because of how the tax code works, any amount I contribute to an IRA every year (in my case, up to a limit of $5,000 for the 2011 tax year) is deductible from my income, meaning I don't have to pay taxes on it. These IRA's can usually be invested either in FDIC-insured cash deposits or in securities, as you see fit. Put another way, the government will pay you to put more money in the hands of the banks—money that I won't be able to access without penalty for another 30 years, but that the banks can use right away to make more money for themselves. Consequently, even though I made $49,500 last year, I only owed taxes as if my income were $46,000. The difference between those two tax bills? $875. The government literally paid me $875 to invest my own money. If I hadn't made those IRA contributions, I would have ended up owing money, instead of getting back a comparatively substantial refund—and I would have ended up paying around 12.4 percent of my income in federal taxes.
Now, even 12.4 percent doesn't seem very high. So given my income tax rate, why would someone like me complain that when someone like Mitt Romney pays an effective tax rate of about 13.9 percent? The answer lies in the fact that federal income taxes aren't the only federal taxes I pay. Like most everyone else who gets paid wages, I also pay Social Security and Medicare taxes—payroll taxes, for short. The tax rate for This doesn't fluctuate: it's 4.2 percent for Social Security, and 1.45 percent for Medicare. Not that these taxes are equitable either: In 2012, only the first $110,100 of wages will be taxed for Social Security and Medicare. That means that I pay payroll taxes on all of my income, but someone who makes a million a year pays those taxes on only a tenth of that.
All in all, I ended up paying $2,754.38 in payroll taxes in 2011. When you combine that with the income tax owed, you end up with $8,010.38, resulting in a total effective tax rate of roughly 16.2 percent.
Let's finalize this point: as it is, I pay a larger share of my income in federal taxes than does Mitt Romney. Remember that Mitt Romney pays virtually nothing in payroll taxes, because the type of capital gains income that Mitt Romney makes isn't taxed for Social Security and Medicare. Even worse, that discrepancy would have been even larger if the government hadn't paid me to set aside my money in ways that allow people like Mitt Romney to grow even wealthier. That system is fundamentally unfair. This is exactly why we need fixes like the Buffett Rule and the payroll tax extension that President Obama fought so hard for: the average American taxpayer deserves to know that someone in Washington realizes that Mitt Romney shouldn't be paying a smaller share of his income than someone like me.
BANGUI (Reuters) - The president of the Central African Republic appealed on Thursday for France and the United States to help push back rebels threatening his government and the capital, but Paris said its troops were only ready to protect French nationals.

The exchanges came as regional African leaders tried to broker a ceasefire deal and as rebels said they had temporarily halted their advance on Bangui, the capital, to allow talks to take place.
Insurgents on motorbikes and in pickup trucks have driven to within 75 km (47 miles) of Bangui after weeks of fighting, threatening to end President Francois Bozize's nearly 10-year-stint in charge of the turbulent, resource-rich country.
French nuclear energy group Areva mines the Bakouma uranium deposit in the CAR's south - France's biggest commercial interest in its former colony.
The rebel advance has highlighted the instability of a country that has remained poor since independence from Paris in 1960 despite rich deposits of uranium, gold and diamonds. Average income is barely over $2 a day.
Bozize on Thursday appealed for French and U.S. military support to stop the SELEKA rebel coalition, which has promised to overthrow him unless he implements a previous peace deal in full.
He told a crowd of anti-rebel protesters in the riverside capital that he had asked Paris and Washington to help move the rebels away from the capital to clear the way for peace talks which regional leaders say could be held soon in Libreville, Gabon.
“We are asking our cousins the French and the United States, which are major powers, to help us push back the rebels to their initial positions in a way that will permit talks in Libreville to resolve this crisis,” Bozize said.
France has 250 soldiers in its landlocked former colony as part of a peacekeeping mission and Paris in the past has ousted or propped up governments - including by using air strikes to defend Bozize against rebels in 2006.
But French President Francois Hollande poured cold water on the latest request for help.
“If we have a presence, it's not to protect a regime, it's to protect our nationals and our interests and in no way to intervene in the internal business of a country, in this case the Central African Republic,” Hollande said on the sidelines of a visit to a wholesale food market outside Paris.
“Those days are over,” he said.
Some 1,200 French nationals live in the CAR, mostly in the capital, according to the French Foreign Ministry, where they typically work for mining firms or aid groups.
CEASEFIRE TALKS
The U.N. Security Council issued a statement saying its members “condemn the continued attacks on several towns perpetrated by the ‘SELEKA' coalition of armed groups which gravely undermine the Libreville Comprehensive Peace Agreement and threaten the civilian population.”
U.S. State Department spokesman Patrick Ventrell said the U.S. embassy had temporarily suspended operations and the U.S. ambassador and other embassy personnel had left the country.
Officials from around central Africa are due to meet in Bangui later on Thursday to open initial talks with the government and rebels.
A rebel spokesman said fighters had temporarily halted their advance to allow dialogue.
“We will not enter Bangui,” Colonel Djouma Narkoyo, the rebel spokesman, told Reuters by telephone.
Previous rebel promises to stop advancing have been broken, and a diplomatic source said rebels had taken up positions around Bangui on Thursday, effectively surrounding it.
The atmosphere remained tense in the city the day after anti-rebel protests broke out, and residents were stocking up on food and water.
Government soldiers deployed at strategic sites and French troops reinforced security at the French embassy after protesters threw rocks at the building on Wednesday.
In Paris, the French Foreign Ministry said protecting foreigners and embassies was the responsibility of the CAR authorities.
“This message will once again be stressed to the CAR's charge d'affaires in Paris, who has been summoned this afternoon,” a ministry spokesman said.
He also said France condemned the rebels for pursuing hostilities and urged all sides to commit to talks.
Bozize came to power in a 2003 rebellion that overthrew President Ange-Felix Patasse.
However, France is increasingly reluctant to directly intervene in conflicts in its former colonies. Since coming to power in May, Hollande has promised to end its shadowy relations with former colonies and put ties on a healthier footing.
A military source and an aid worker said the rebels had got as far as Damara, 75 km (47 miles) from Bangui, by late afternoon on Wednesday, having skirted Sibut, where some 150 Chadian soldiers had earlier been deployed to try and block a push south by a rebel coalition.
With a government that holds little sway outside the capital, some parts of the country have long endured the consequences of conflicts in troubled neighbors Chad, Sudan and the Democratic Republic of Congo spilling over.
The Central African Republic is one of a number of nations in the region where U.S. Special Forces are helping local forces try to track down the Lords Resistance Army, a rebel group responsible for killing thousands of civilians across four African nations.
I'm on record (ha!) stating my opinion that the vinyl resurgence is socially and morally significant. Interest in vinyl is up, vinyl sales are up. Are downloads and streaming in trouble? Well, of course not. Still....
Here's what's interesting. Old guys know how vinyl works; they were young when vinyl was still dominant and they learned the ins and outs of vinyl. Enthusiasts who are new to vinyl have less access to that information; simply put, they might not know much about analog technology. Let's start changing that. Vinyl is even cooler if you know how it works. For example, how do they get left and right channels into one groove? And old guys—are you sure you really know?
In today's mainly digital world, multi-channel audio playback is relatively simple. A CD, for example, places data into a frame format; each frame holds twelve 16-bit audio samples; the player's processor simply reads the demodulated bitstream and directs left and right words to the appropriate output path. Easy peasy.
But getting stereo into a record groove isn't so simple. We take it for granted, and the solution is elegant, but it took years and years of experimentation before a solution was achieved. Even then, the stereo groove that was standardized, and is used today, has serious compromises that inherently limit the fidelity that can be achieved.
To help understand the groove mechanics at work, take a look at some very tidy animations available at vinylrecorder.com. First, you'll see two basic ways to encode a monaural analog signal in a groove. In vertical recording (Edison's baby, born in 1877), the stylus rides up and down according to the analog signal; the depth (and width) of the groove changes. With horizontal recording (Berliner's baby, born in 1887), the stylus moves laterally; you'll see that the width of the groove is constant, but it wiggles side to side.
Both vertical and horizontal recording can be used to record a monaural signal. But there are limitations. For example, vertical recording suffers from nonlinear tracing distortion that occurs when the shape of the playback stylus differs from the recording stylus; Edison hated tracing distortion. Overall, horizontal recording is better than vertical recording but it is still plagued by diameter loss, a decrease in signal output with increasing frequency and decreasing groove diameter. It also suffers from a problem known as pinch effect.
But what about stereo? Well, we could make a record with two sets of horizontally recorded grooves. Not ideal. An improvement, obviously, would be one groove holding both channels. To accomplish this (see the third animation) we can combine vertical and horizontal recording. The groove correspondingly goes up and down, and side to side. Voila! Stereo! Hmm, but there are problems. Chiefly, because one channel uses vertical recording and the other uses horizontal, their fidelity characteristics are markedly different. Not good.
The solution is proof that engineering is the art of compromise. The subsequent animations show the combined assembly rotated 45 degrees. Both channels use part vertical, and part horizontal recording. Because both channels share the attributes of the two recording methods, the fidelity of the two channels is very similar. Of course, both channels also share the disadvantages of both vertical and horizontal recording. For example, both channels still partly face the vertical recording problem of tracing distortion. Over the years, engineers vigorously addressed the issue, for example, with improved stylus shapes (such as the elliptical stylus) but Edison's nemesis still lingers in today's stereo grooves.
Kind of interesting. Now grab some vinyl from your collection, preferably a disc with wildly exaggerated "ping-pong" stereo effects, and give a listen. Pretty cool, right?
WATCH: Fox Sports' @ClayTravis tells @BrookeBCNN the two things he cares about are "the first amendment and boobs.." via @ShaianNavaei pic.twitter.com/0mLHz5m6A2
CNN host Brooke Baldwin could not believe what she was hearing: “Hold on. I just wanted to make sure I heard you correctly as a woman anchoring this show … what did you say? You believe in the First Amendment and b-double-o-b-s?”
Clay Travis, who identifies as “a Southern white conservative,” clarified that, yes, she had heard him correctly. “Boobs,” he said. “Two things that have only never let me down in this entire country's history: the First Amendment and boobs. So those are the only two things I believe in absolutely in the country.”
Baldwin and the other guest on the segment, Keith Reed, were flabbergasted. This was supposed to be a segment about President Donald Trump's feud with ESPN and Jemele Hill, yet Travis dropped some casual sexism and objectification along the way. And he tripled down on it when asked repeatedly.
Baldwin then ended the segment in frustration. “I'm done,” she said. “This is done. This conversation is over. Yanking mics. Bye. See ya.”
Baldwin later tweeted that she was still in disbelief over the segment, pointing out that this was never okay.
That was... I just... it was one of those thought bubbles "did he actually say that on MY SHOW?!" Note to men -- that is never okay. #smh — Brooke Baldwin (@BrookeBCNN) September 15, 2017

In this article we are creating a Measuring Tape App using Apple's ARKit Framework. It' really a cool app. Without using any tape we are going to measure distance with iPhone/iPad.
AR made us to create excellent real world Apps. By using Augmented Reality we can create different Virtual Apps, out of those Measuring Distance App is one.
Before starting this example ,first go through the basic sample example about How To Add Cube.
Getting Started:
Requirements :
Xcode 9 , Device with an A9 or later processor running with iOS11.
First create a new project -> open Xcode -> File -> New -> Project -> Augmented Reality App, then tap next button. Type product name as 'ARKitMeasuringTape' then tap next and select the folder to save project.
Build and Run, Move camera around we see spaceship.
Great, Up to now everything working fine. But we don't need spaceship for measuring distance so remove unwanted files.
First delete 'art.scnassets' from project. Then open ViewController.swift, delete all methods after this pragma mark '// MARK: - ARSCNViewDelegate' .
From viewDidLoad() method delete the following lines of code.
// Create a new scene let scene = SCNScene(named: "art.scnassets/ship.scn")! // Set the scene to the view sceneView.scene = scene
Build and Run, SpaceShip removed and we see regular camera.
All Good. We will get into target of this article.
Plane Detection :
First thing for measuring distance we need to detect plane surface. For that ARKit provides a great function but it detects only horizontal planes. For us it will work.
In ARKit you can specify that you want to detect horizontal planes by setting the planeDetection property to ARPlaneDetectionHorizontal on your session configuration object.
Replace the 'viewWillAppear' method with the following method.
override func viewWillAppear(_ animated: Bool) { super.viewWillAppear(animated) let configuration = ARWorldTrackingSessionConfiguration() configuration.planeDetection = .horizontal sceneView.session.run(configuration) }
Everything set for horizontal plane detection.
Now, how can we know whether detected or not. No worries, for that we will draw a square over camera based on ARSCNViewDelegate methods.
We use the following delegate method. Calls exactly once per frame before any animation and actions are evaluated and any physics are simulated.
- (void)renderer:(id )renderer updateAtTime:(NSTimeInterval)time
For drawing a square we are going to use Apple's
FocusSquare class.
Download all the required files.
Drag all files to the project.
Setting Up Square :
Create a global object for the FocusSquare class as following.
var focusSquare = FocusSquare() var dragOnInfinitePlanesEnabled = false // for infinite Planes
For setting up square on the SceneView, we need to add as child node. Add the following method.
func setupFocusSquare() { focusSquare.unhide() focusSquare.removeFromParentNode() sceneView.scene.rootNode.addChildNode(focusSquare) }
For detecting planes we need to do hitTest method. For that write following extension to the bottom of the class.
extension ViewController { func worldPositionFromScreenPosition(_ position: CGPoint, objectPos: SCNVector3?, infinitePlane: Bool = false) -> (position: SCNVector3?, planeAnchor: ARPlaneAnchor?, hitAPlane: Bool) { // ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- // 1. Always do a hit test against exisiting plane anchors first. // (If any such anchors exist & only within their extents.) let planeHitTestResults = sceneView.hitTest(position, types: .existingPlaneUsingExtent) if let result = planeHitTestResults.first { let planeHitTestPosition = SCNVector3.positionFromTransform(result.worldTransform) let planeAnchor = result.anchor // Return immediately - this is the best possible outcome. return (planeHitTestPosition, planeAnchor as? ARPlaneAnchor, true) } // ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- // 2. Collect more information about the environment by hit testing against // the feature point cloud, but do not return the result yet. var featureHitTestPosition: SCNVector3? var highQualityFeatureHitTestResult = false let highQualityfeatureHitTestResults = sceneView.hitTestWithFeatures(position, coneOpeningAngleInDegrees: 18, minDistance: 0.2, maxDistance: 2.0) if !highQualityfeatureHitTestResults.isEmpty { let result = highQualityfeatureHitTestResults[0] featureHitTestPosition = result.position highQualityFeatureHitTestResult = true } // ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- // 3. If desired or necessary (no good feature hit test result): Hit test // against an infinite, horizontal plane (ignoring the real world). if (infinitePlane && dragOnInfinitePlanesEnabled) || !highQualityFeatureHitTestResult { let pointOnPlane = objectPos ?? SCNVector3Zero let pointOnInfinitePlane = sceneView.hitTestWithInfiniteHorizontalPlane(position, pointOnPlane) if pointOnInfinitePlane != nil { return (pointOnInfinitePlane, nil, true) } } // ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- // 4. If available, return the result of the hit test against high quality // features if the hit tests against infinite planes were skipped or no // infinite plane was hit. if highQualityFeatureHitTestResult { return (featureHitTestPosition, nil, false) } // ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- // 5. As a last resort, perform a second, unfiltered hit test against features. // If there are no features in the scene, the result returned here will be nil. let unfilteredFeatureHitTestResults = sceneView.hitTestWithFeatures(position) if !unfilteredFeatureHitTestResults.isEmpty { let result = unfilteredFeatureHitTestResults[0] return (result.position, nil, false) } return (nil, nil, false) } }
The above method will tell whether a plane detected or not. If detected, it will return the position and planeAnchor. Position is an Vector3 and plane anchor is an ARPlaneAnchor .
For updating the square write the following method.
func updateFocusSquare() { let (worldPosition, planeAnchor, _) = worldPositionFromScreenPosition(view.center, objectPos: focusSquare.position) if let worldPosition = worldPosition { focusSquare.update(for: worldPosition, planeAnchor: planeAnchor, camera: sceneView.session.currentFrame?.camera) } }
In above method we are calling extension method for checking whether a plane detected or not and updating the square.
Square should update whenever frame changes. For that we are using ARSCNViewDelegate method as we discussed before.
Write the following method after ARSCNViewDelegate pragma mark.
func renderer(_ renderer: SCNSceneRenderer, updateAtTime time: TimeInterval) { DispatchQueue.main.async { self.updateFocusSquare() } }
Above delegate method calls once per frame and updates square based on frame.
Finally we need to call setupFocusSquare() method in viewDidLoad().
Build and Run, BINGO we see Focus square try to focus on plane surface we see as below image with Full Focus Square.
Add Distance Label :
Now add a label as a subview to the SceneView. Create label as follow.
let distanceLabel = UILabel()
Add distanceLabel as Subview. Add the following method.
func addDistanceLabel() { let margins = sceneView.layoutMarginsGuide sceneView.addSubview(distanceLabel) distanceLabel.translatesAutoresizingMaskIntoConstraints = false distanceLabel.leadingAnchor.constraint(equalTo: margins.leadingAnchor, constant: 10.0).isActive = true distanceLabel.topAnchor.constraint(equalTo: margins.topAnchor, constant: 10.0).isActive = true distanceLabel.heightAnchor.constraint(equalToConstant: 50).isActive = true distanceLabel.textColor = UIColor.white distanceLabel.text = "Distance = ??" }
And call this method in viewDidLoad().
Not using storyboard for adding label.
Build and Run, we see Distance at Top-Left corner.
Calculating Distance :
For calculating distance we need two points. So add startPoint and endpoint to ViewController.swift.
var startPoint : SCNVector3? = nil var endPoint : SCNVector3? = nil
we can measure distance between two points using following formula.
let point A = (x1,y1,z1) and point B = (x2,y2,z2)
Then distance will be
So create one method for calculating distance between two points. Add the following method.
func getDistanceBetween(startPoint: SCNVector3, endPoint: SCNVector3) -> Double? { var distance : Double? = nil let x = powf((endPoint.x - startPoint.x), 2.0) let y = powf((endPoint.y - startPoint.y), 2.0) let z = powf((endPoint.z - startPoint.z), 2.0) distance = sqrt(Double(x + y + z)) return distance }
From where to get these points?
We are going to get based on user tap on screen from where they want to start for measuring distance. First we do hitTest for checking whether a planeAnchors exists at tapped point, if exists then take first anchor position and store it to the startPoint.
In the same way user taps somewhere, up to where he wants to measure. And take same point and do hitTest for checking whether a planeAnchors exists at tapped point, if exists then take first anchor position and store it to the endPoint.
Create method for getting start and end points. So add touchesBegan() method to ViewController.swift.
override func touchesBegan(_ touches: Set , with event: UIEvent?) { if let touch = touches.first { let results = sceneView.hitTest(touch.location(in: sceneView), types: [ARHitTestResult.ResultType.featurePoint] ) if let anchor = results.first { let hitPointPosition = SCNVector3.positionFromTransform(anchor.worldTransform) if startPoint == nil && endPoint == nil { for child in sceneView.scene.rootNode.childNodes { if child.name == "Start" || child.name == "End" { child.removeFromParentNode() distanceLabel.text = "Distance = ??" } } } if startPoint == nil { focusSquare.hide() startPoint = hitPointPosition let node = createCrossNode(size: 0.01, color:UIColor.blue, horizontal:false) node.position = startPoint! node.name = "Start" sceneView.scene.rootNode.addChildNode(node) }else { endPoint = hitPointPosition let node = createCrossNode(size: 0.01, color:UIColor.red, horizontal:false) node.position = endPoint! node.name = "End" sceneView.scene.rootNode.addChildNode(node) } if endPoint != nil { setupFocusSquare() let distance = self.getDistanceBetween(startPoint: startPoint!, endPoint: endPoint!) distanceLabel.text = String(format: "Distance(Approx) = %.2f cm",distance! * 100) startPoint = nil endPoint = nil } } } }
Great! All set. Build and Run we see camera, try to target on a plane surface then tap on the screen for the start point and again tap for endpoint.
you see a distance in centimeters at top right of screen.
I show two samples what tested.
Test Case 1 :
Original distance = 40 cm
Calculated distance = 38.25 cm (Approx)
Test Case 2 :
Original distance = 20 cm
Calculated distance = 19.04 cm (Approx)
We are getting approximate results. Minor problem is that startPoint node is changing slightly its position. That's not exact behavior of Augmented Reality. Still it's in beta, surely Apple will do much more refinements for live release.

However, more roads could be allowed to serve street food like those two famous roads, Bangkok Governor Pol General Assawin Kwanmuang was quoted saying by the Thai National News Bureau.
Khao San Road and one traffic lane of Yaowarat Road will be closed from 6pm until midnight to allow the sale of street food, he said.
Street food vendors must wear aprons, hats and gloves every time they handle food.
The Bangkok Metropolitan Administration (BMA) will designate areas for washing and for the disposal of waste.
The governor said the Ministry of Commerce would control prices and would require street food vendors to clearly display price tags in Thai, English and Chinese.
The Ministry of Labor will be responsible for street food vendors who hire migrant workers.
The governor added that the BMA was considering managing street food on other roads like Khao San and Yaowarat roads.
The time has come for Lionel Messi to tackle a new challenge after Real Madrid humiliation
The five-time Ballon d'Or winner is the only good thing about Barcelona currently and he would do well to consider the prospect of winning elsewhere
This summer has brought into sharp focus two things; one, clubs are having to pay more than ever for elite talent and two, 's buy-out fees in that context are set tantalisingly low.
Neymar went to for a fee of €222 million (£200m). Casting the eye around the other completed deals you are left with the impression that €222m for Neymar feels about right in the current climate.
Messi 11/2 hat-trick against Betis
If Romelu Lukaku for example is worth up to £90m then Neymar is priced correctly. Buy-out clauses are supposed to be a deterrent; at Barça, they are more like an invitation.
Consider that Messi's buy-out currently stands at €250m. If Lukaku is £90m and Neymar is €222m then Messi comes in positively cheap at €250m (£225m).
Messi “agreed” a new Barça contract earlier on this summer but as yet it remains unsigned. It is, however, reported to be a formality and the new deal will see Messi through to 2021. A new buy-out will be set at €300m (£270m) - still a bargain given Messi's credentials.
And any club with aspirations for Messi's signature would do well to consider the possibility of signing him in this transfer window, particularly in the .
A move could well be be for Messi's own good. Barcelona in its current guise is not a club suitable for the best player in the world.
They are a mess from top to bottom – with jailings and tax fraud in and around the boardroom, what was once the world's best youth production facility faltering badly, ineptitude in the transfer market and a first-team permitted to grow old together without being adequately replaced.
Inside Liverpool's Coutinho fight
They may have won the treble in 2015 but that achievement only served to paper over the cracks – which is exactly what Messi's brilliance has been doing ever since.
When Barça is in trouble they rely on Messi to an inhumane extent. When they are stuttering, Messi can lift them a class above the rest. But this is not how the last act of the world's greatest should play out.
Messi is not just another player; he deserves a pedestal. There is an old adage that dictates no player is bigger than any club but Messi does more than any other to challenge the wisdom of that statement.
Worst of all, there is no clear plan for Messi. Any club in the world would have binders of blueprints prepared in the event of any Messi departure from Camp Nou.
'This is where you'll play, this is how WE will service YOU, these are the 15 matches we'll rest you, here are the keys to your private jet.'
At Barça, Messi is doing what he always did to his own exceedingly high standards, but where once there was Xavi there is now Paulinho and where once there was Neymar there is now Andre Gomes.
Barcelona are riding Messi like a donkey, putting him on the line time and time again for results while letting the entire organisation burn down around him.
He should consider whether or his professional ambitions are best satisfied elsewhere.
Time is of the essence for Messi now. He is not a 17-year-old kid with the world at his feet. He's 30 years old and the road will soon be closing in.
Paulinho an embarrassment to Barcelona
Why should he stay and bail out a failing team over and over? Why should he have to put up with a board and a club that has consistently in the past couple of years to equal his own high standards?
Barcelona are heading into this season well behind – even die-hard socio Gerard Pique is now admitting that .
Article continues below
This could very well be a lost season as Barça attempt to cobble together a squad , a title challenge, a run, anything.
What is patently true is that Real Madrid - who beat them 5-1 over two legs in the Spanish Supercopa - don't regard them as anything like the same sort of challengers they have been in years gone by. Look at Karim Benzema's goal in the Supercopa again and count three back-flick passes in the build up.
Madrid don't fear Barça; they toy with them and Messi deserves better.
A cottage industry of memoirs detailing their writers' journeys from restrictive “ultra-Orthodox” upbringings into the embrace of resplendent enlightenment and freedom has sprung up in recent years. Reading samples of the genre always reminds me of my own abandonment of the Jewish religious tradition in which I had been raised. I was 12.
My apostasy didn't last. But some of the same things that pushed the Ortho-leavers in the directions they came to take bothered me greatly, too, at the time: scientific facts, social mores at radical odds with those of the observant Jewish world, non-Jew-centric world events and, more prosaic but no less discomfiting, things like dress codes, in my case it was a looming post-bar mitzvah black hat and jacket.
I would never presume to condemn anyone who has left the Orthodox way of life. Some who have fled their communities have recounted witnessing or experiencing harrowing abuse and, often, others' denial of the crimes. Judaism requires us not to judge another until you have “reached his place” — that is to say, walked in his or her shoes. Outrages like those some have described would be powerful challenges to any sensitive soul. And so I feel no ill will toward the honest memoirists, only pain — both for their experiences and for what they are missing.
But enough about them. This is all about me.
I remember my first exposure to a resolutely secular perspective, my first brush with illumination. It took the form of a book. I was working summers in my uncle's Jewish bookstore, which carried not only holy texts but also a broad assortment of literature with only tenuous connections to Jewishness. The store wasn't a busy one, at least not as busy as my tween mind, and I took the opportunities that my job servicing customers afforded me to peruse some of the volumes. There were Jewish joke books and books about famous Jews. There were even copies of Betty Friedan's “The Feminine Mystique” (erroneously shipped by a wholesaler from whom we had ordered Ernest van den Haag's “The Jewish Mystique”).
But what captivated me most was a volume by Lewis Browne called “This Believing World,” a deliciously condescending look at religions, including Judaism, and their evolutions.
The book was just what a cynical kid with a contrarian streak would savor. I lapped it up and realized — or so I thought — that surely the Judaism in which I had been raised and schooled was but a contemporary sort of magical thinking, different from primitive belief systems (and from other religions) in its particulars, but not in its essence.
Christopher Hitchens and Richard Dawkins are Browne's intellectual heirs (or reincarnations, perhaps, if one subscribes to such things). I imagine that, young or otherwise, uninformed people reading those contemporary writers' atheistic fare today feel the same sort of heady supremacy that I felt as a 12-year-old enlightened intellectual.
I kept my discovery to myself. What, I reasoned, would have been the point of coming out, so to speak, at so delicate an age? Why not, I convinced myself, just wing it for the time being? Looking back now, I think that, deep down, I was probably more of an agnostic about Browneianism than I consciously admitted to myself. In any event, I soon enough came to entertain grave doubts about some of the ostensible truths my unholy book had offered.
My parents did not overly shelter me. The public library was my intellectual playground, and I played there often. But my diet of books on science and philosophy and psychology (leavened by more novels than I care to recall and by a steady fare of Mad Magazine) was augmented by other books, books that presented a view of history, science and life, based on Jewish tradition. And by my parents' example, and by that of at least some of my Jewish day school religious teachers. And by meeting religiously observant Jews who truly lived their beliefs. Most of all, though, by doing some good, hard thinking of my own.
I thought about the world, and realized that the vastness of the universe didn't have to mean that our niche of the cosmos was negligible. Rather, it could be a means of fostering the realization — against humanity's proclivity to see itself as omnipotent and invincible — that we are but a tiny part of an unimaginably powerful God's creation.
I realized that the new physics presented a picture more evocative of mysticism than of Newtonian Tinkertoys; that evolution of one species into another is a fascinating idea, but not an obviation of a divine creator; that the mystery of consciousness remained unexplained, and likely unexplainable, by the scientific method. Ditto for the Big Bang, not to mention what engendered it. (I have kept up a keen interest in the sciences since, and have found nothing in legitimate scientific data to challenge my Jewish belief in any way.)
I thought about world history and how no matter how wise and developed some civilizations may have been, the Jewish one was what guided an animistic, polytheistic and murderous world toward monotheism and attendant concepts like law, spirituality, reason and peace.
I thought about the baffling preponderance of Jews among any list one might make of personalities who changed the world, or who most benefitted mankind (that, a main theme of the aforementioned book by Ernest Van den Haag). And about the equally astounding and inexplicable preponderance of anti-Semitism – across both the centuries and the continents, in variegated forms with nothing in common but their hatred of Jews. And about how our religious heritage is still valued and lived today, and how our people, even after being repeatedly decimated, has not only survived but thrived, even returning, at least in part, to our ancestral home.
And most of all, I thought, long and hard, about Judaism's foundational belief, that the Torah, including its Oral Law component, was transmitted by God Himself to our ancestors at Sinai, through Moses. That thinking, aided by further reading and research, led me to conclude that, for all the similarities among religions, the Jewish claim really is singular. No other faith system has ever claimed a source in a mass revelation of the divine. It's always a single figure making a claim, a Paul or a Muhammad or a Joseph Smith. And that's because a mass revelation cannot be fabricated; all the revealed-to mass's members have to agree on what they collectively experienced, or the claim of the event will be stillborn. The only claim of a mass revelation, and it could persevere only because it happened, is Sinai.
I came to recognize some other things, too. Like the uniqueness of the fact that some of the Torah's laws are inherently self-defeating (like the laying fallow of all fields in the Holy Land every seventh year, or the convergence of all the nation's men in Jerusalem thrice yearly — leaving the borders of the land unprotected), things that no man-made system of law would ever sanely propose. And the further anomaly of the Torah's judgmental descriptions of its “heroes,” their faults as well as their strengths. Not to mention the coming to pass of the Torah's predictions that the Jews will stray from the Torah and be exiled to land after land, yet maintain (or be forced to maintain) their identity, and that from exile they will eventually return to their ancestral home (a prediction yet to be fulfilled in toto, of course, but that is well on its way).
Each of those singularities, I concluded, might be (and has been) countered with a tailored-to-fit “explanation” to avoid the unthinkable-to-some conclusion that the Torah is true. But at some point, Occam's razor must be wielded to cut through the confusion, paring down all the astounding oddities to that single explanation that Judaism, as it has existed for millennia, is true.
And so, even before I became a bar mitzvah, I had already come to regard “This Believing World” and the worldview it so eloquently promoted as something that, for all its glitter, wasn't gold, or even precious in any way.
To be sure, over the decades since my brush with disbelief, I have been severely unimpressed with, at times outraged by, how some ostensibly religious Jews have behaved. But being observant of many, even most, of Judaism's laws is no guarantee of being observant of them all. All of us, even us religious Jews, have personal flaws, some of us even personal demons — to which we may fall in battle. That indicts us, perhaps, but not Judaism.
With each passing year, though, I came to appreciate more deeply the true exemplars of Jewish observance I have met and known, great rabbis and simple Jews alike, and the truth of the collective Jewish religious tradition. And so I decided to believe, to slightly alter Tom Wolfe's poignant phrase, the heresy of my own eyes.

Cam Newton made headlines for ripping down a Green Bay Packers banner ahead of Sunday's game.
Now, it appears he could get in some trouble for it.
According to the Fayetteville Observer, the owner of the banner has reported the “theft” to the police and plans to pursue further action.
Mike Dobs, a native of Fayetteville, N.C., spent $500 to have the banner made last year. He told the Fayetteville Observer he believes the banner is destroyed, though a Panthers' employee said the team would attempt to make it up to him.
“I was just shocked, shocked,” Dobs told the paper. "We thought he was going to sign our banner -- we were happy to see him -- and he ripped it out of our hands."
Newton said the following in his postgame press conference, before it was announced Dobs reported it as a theft:
"It was a Green Bay banner in Bank of America Stadium," Newton said. "It just doesn't match. No disrespect to any Green Bay Packer there, it's just a respect thing. We take pride in having an edge in playing in front of the Carolinas each and every week.
"It's something that I feel it's my due diligence to protect this house. ... You're not about to sell a Whopper at a McDonald's. That's the gist of the story."

Rockets follow up with candidates as coaching search continues
The Rockets have had follow-up conversations in the past few days with several of the coaching candidates under consideration as they have narrowed their field of coaches under consideration, a person with knowledge of the process said on the condition of anonymity because of the private nature of talks.
They have not begun a second round of more formal interviews to select a successor for Kevin McHale and J.B. Bickerstaff
ESPN reported on Tuesday that former Suns, Knicks and Lakers coach Mike D'Antoni has been "summoned" to have a second interview with the Rockets and particularly with Rockets owner Leslie Alexander. But according to two individuals involved in the process, an additional formal interview is not scheduled with D'Antoni.
The Rockets have met with former Suns coach Jeff Hornacek, former Cavaliers coach David Blatt, Clippers assistant Sam Cassell, Hornets assistant Stephen Silas and Rockets assistant Chris Finch. Former Pacers coach Frank Vogel and Spurs assistant Ettore Messina are also part of the process, a person with knowledge of talks said though without specifying on whether they have completed interviews.
Bickerstaff and former Rockets guard Kenny Smith also interviewed, but Bickerstaff withdrew from consideration and Smith was told he was no longer a candidate as the Rockets decided to focus on coaches with either head coaching experience or extensive experience as an assistant.
We are proud to introduce Liri runtime and apps on Flatpak!
Flatpak is a new technology for building and installing desktop applications and we are working on getting our cross-platform applications and runtime packaged.
The first milestone has been reached and we now have the Liri runtime with all the common dependencies for the apps, the SDK bits to build the apps with, as well as the following apps:
Browser
Calculator

The 2015 VMAs were a typical award show: Music industry puppets doing what they are told to do by their masters. The host of the show, Miley Cyrus, is the ultimate product of the industry: a hyper-sexualized Kitten slave with no control over her behavior, image or her thoughts.
If you are a regular reader of Vigilant Citizen, you know that I've been writing about award shows for years. I always feel compelled to analyze them because they so openly reveal the powers that control popular culture and their true intent. Six years ago, I wrote an important article on the 2009 VMAs that was one of the most blatant displays of the occult elite ever seen. Do you remember who the stars were of the 2009 VMAs? Kanye West and Taylor Swift. Do you know who the stars were of the 2015 VMAs? Kanye West and Taylor Swift. Six years later, the puppet show still uses the same puppets to “entertain” us. The VMAs are indeed not for the claustrophobic. Year after year, the show unites the same faces in a closed space to act out whatever ritual the elite wants the masses to witness this particular year. The 2015 VMAs were no different, and, in some ways, took things to a disgusting new low.
The 2015 VMAs were about mind control slaves, alter personas, hypersexualization, degradation, strange political propaganda, and, most importantly, gigantic fake butts. It is about everything the industry has turned into: a bunch of broken people being manipulated to break the masses as a whole. Hosting this entire mess is the figurehead of Beta Kitten programming, Miley Cyrus, who, throughout the show, aimed to prove that she is an empty shell, an artificial alter persona that has been reduced to talking only about either sex or drugs. And, when she is not talking, her act is about degradation mixed with a hefty dose of Illuminati symbolism.
Opening Sequence
The opening sequence of the VMAs was a near-psychedelic animated montage that clearly exhibited what these award shows are truly about: No, it is not about the music. The VMAs are about the rituals we are made to witness – all pre-programmed by the higher-ups of the music industry.
That opening sequence sets the table for what was to come: A Illuminati MK slave extravaganza.
Miley Cyrus: Beta Kitten Slave
As stated above, the VMAs were mostly about Miley Cyrus and her Beta Kitten slave status. It is as if her handlers wanted to show to the world to what degrading lows they can force her to go.
At the start of the show, Miley says this:
“I am totally stoked to have my entire family here tonight.”
Only a few years ago, in 2011, Billy Ray was speaking out against Miley's handlers and even added that his family was “under attack by Satan” (read my full article about it here). Billy Ray stated:
“I've done some stupid crap – I do stupid crap. We all do. But it's different when you sit back and you see it happening to your little girl,” he explained. “I feel like I got to try. It's my daughter” “And,” Billy Ray added, “some of these handlers are perhaps more interested in handling Miley's money than her safety and her career,” something that leaves him “scared for her.” Billy Ray went on to discuss how fame ultimately cut short the lives of Jackson, Cobain and Anna-Nicole Smith, which has made him all the more eager to help his daughter navigate through life in the spotlight. When he looks back on Miley's rapid rise to fame through “Hannah Montana,” on which they both starred, he said he sees how “the business was driving a wedge between us.” “It destroyed my family. I'll tell you right now – the damn show destroyed my family,” Billy Ray declared, before admitting he wishes they never agreed to do the Disney Channel show. “I'd take it back in a second. For my family to be here and just be everybody okay, safe and sound and happy and normal, would have been fantastic. Heck, yeah,” he said. “I'd erase it all in a second if I could.” And for those who believe Billy Ray's concern is really about whether his daughter will continue to be a cash cow, he offered to set the record straight. “I've never made a dime off of Miley,” he insisted. “You got a lot of people have made percentages off of her. I'm proud to say to this day I've never made one commissioned dollar, or dime, off of my daughter.” Billy Ray didn't place all the blame on those currently in Miley's life. There are also evil forces at work, he claimed. “Somewhere along this journey, both mine and Miley's faith has been shaken,” he said. “That saddens me the most.” His family, Billy Ray argued, is now being ruined by Satan. “No doubt,” he insisted. “There's no doubt about it – NY Daily News, Billy Ray Cyrus in GQ: My family is under attack by Satan, I'm ‘scared for' daughter Miley
A few years later, Billy Ray went from accusing the “evil forces” of the industry of manipulating Miley and even fearing they might end up like other industry slaves (namely Michael Jackson and Anna Nicole Smith), to sitting at the VMAs and cheering for his MK slave daughter. I guess he got subdued.
Knowing that Miley's entire family was in the audience made watching the VMAs even more difficult.
Like everything else in the VMAs, this cringe-inducing scenario was not random. The sick, twisted industry was openly showing what it is doing to Billy Ray's child and, on a larger level, all of the nation's children. By putting onstage Miley Cyrus, the wholesome Disney girl who grew up before our eyes, and turning her into Beta slave – while her father is watching – is the industry telling us: “This is what we are doing to the youth, and there is nothing you can do about it”.
Speaking of Instagram, a humorous skit during the VMAs was about two men in suits dictating to Miley what she should post on her Instagram account. Considering the fact that Miley keeps posting Illuminati mind control pictures on her account (see my Symbolic Pics of the Month articles), I wouldn't doubt that there are actual men in suits telling her what to post to her millions of followers.
Throughout the show, Miley constantly emphasizes the fact that she is completely uninhibited and that there is no limit to what she can do, which is the prime characteristic of a Beta Kitten slave. For no particular reason, she says:
“You know me, I'll do anything. It doesn't get much crazier than me.”
Instead of actually hosting an awards show, the VMAs was more about portraying the Beta Kitten status of Miley.
In another skit, Miley gets asked what's the nastiest thing she's done.
Why was Miley naked at this specific point and time? Why was she given a mic? Why was she even on camera? Why can't she have a little dignity for a couple of minutes? Because she is the Beta Kitten of the night.
The Nicki Minaj Beef
Then, of course, there was the odd scrap with Nicki Minaj that caused some pointless discussions the next day. First, at the risk of shocking you, yes, this was clearly scripted. It was about one Beta Kitten (Nicki) going at another one (Miley). Let's relive this great moment in American history.
If you re-listen to her little acceptance speech, you'll notice something weird. She starts off speaking very gangsta-like, saying stuff like:
“Where my girls getting money at?”.
Then, as if a switch was turned on, she takes on California Valley Girl accent and says with a little voice:
“Thanks you guys, this is sooo epic. This might sound sooo random but do you know who I'd like to thank? My pastoooor.”
Nicki then switches again, becomes “ghetto”, and calls Miley a b*tch and so forth. In short, Nicki basically switched personalities like MK slaves do. This is one big Illuminati mind control show.
Miley then says that, even though she did not win an award at the VMAs, she nevertheless had an impact on them. We then see the pinnacle moment of her career appear behind her.
The VMAs ended with a horrifying performance from Miley that features one of the worst songs I ever heard in my life.
Gender Fluid
In my article entitled The Agenda Behind Bruce Jenner's Transformation, I described how the confusion of genders is an important part of mass media agenda in 2015. Whether you agree with it or not, nobody can deny that there was a clear mass media push for everything transgender this year. Miley Cyrus' final performance is further proof of this.
Her song ends with her saying:
Why they put the d*ck in the p*ssy? F*ck you.
At the very end of the show, we see a harsh reminder of Miley Cyrus' status as an MK slave.
That's a rather dark name, especially considering the fact that Miley was reportedly very distraught when her dog died last year. In mind control, it is a common technique to cause trauma and dissociation to a slave by giving them a pet to care for and then to kill it.
In short, everything about Miley Cyrus' hosting gig was about promoting and exploiting the Beta Kitten persona she is forced to embody.
Other Puppets
Believe it or not, there were other people at VMAs, and they also brought their share of Illuminati Agenda to the table.
That's some typical, hypocritical, reverse-psychology type stuff the elite loves to do. Doesn't walk around with a label on you automatically reduce you to that label? According to her outfit, Amber Rose has an issue with the word b---h. Maybe she should re-read the title of her own book.
As I stated in my last article on Bieber, he is basically a male Beta slave and his entire career is about shame, humiliation and being a broken person. I am not sure if his crying staged or not, but the camera did stay on him for a few long seconds instead of just cutting away to something else like it usually does. While Bieber was sobbing on stage, Miley takes off her jacket, swings her hips and tells him:
“Hey Justin, call me when you're legal”.
In other words, she treated him like an underage sex toy … like his handlers most likely did. Another very cringe-inducing moment involving two industry slaves.
But the cherry on this MTV Sunday? Kanye West talking very slowly, for a long, long time, making little to no sense, to finally reveal that he wants to be the President of the USA.
While one can wonder why he did not simply thank people for his award instead of going on an endless rant, he said one sentence that sums up the reason behind these award shows.
“This arena, It's going to be totally different setup tomorrow. This stage will be gone. After that night, the stage is gone, but the effect it had on people remains.”
In Conclusion
The 2015 VMAs were, once again, a celebration of everything “the industry” is about. And the industry is not about music, creativity or artistry. It is about the industry showcasing its twisted control over its puppets to the world. More importantly, it is about saturating the airwaves with the antics of people nobody truly cares about in order to make sure that true, revolutionary artists, with the potential to truly change the world, can never get much-needed television time.
In short, the 2015 VMAs, and the “music” it promotes, are about transferring the sad, twisted and toxic culture of the entertainment industry directly into the minds of the youth. It is about doing everything possible to turn young people into the monster that is Miley Cyrus, while their parents watch, powerless, like Billy Ray in the VMAs audience. While Billy Ray has apparently lost his daughter to her handlers, none of us need to see the same fate happen to us or our children. In fact, it can all end by simply pressing a button: TV Off.
In a move that's bound to frighten everyone, HRA Pharma, the company the manufactures the European version of Plan B called Norlevo has revised its packaging to indicate that the pregnancy prevention medication is not always effective for women over 165 pounds and doesn't work at all for women who weigh more than 176 pounds.
As first reported by Mother Jones, HRA Pharma was originally prompted to look into the effectiveness of their emergency contraception by a 2011 study out of the University of Edinburgh, Scotland that found that "the risk of pregnancy was more than threefold greater for obese women compared with women with normal body mass index, whichever EC [Emergency Contraception] was taken." They also found that the risk of pregnancy was particularly high if that emergency contraception was made of levonorgestrel, the hormone found in many of the major over-the-counter morning after pills sold in the United States, like Plan B One-Step. The study recommended that overweight women use IUDs.
If this regulation were to come to the United States, that would mean a substantial swath of American women wouldn't be able to use the medication. According to the CDC, for people 5'4", obesity is considered 174 pounds and for those 5'9", 203 pounds. In 2010, 35% of American women were reported as obese. Though those numbers are based off a flawed system of Body Mass Index, there's no denying that a significant portion of women taking the morning after pill weigh more than 165 or 176 pounds, whether that's considered obese for their body type or not: again according to the CDC, the average weight of a woman over 20 is 166.2 pounds. 11% of sexually active women have reported using EC at least once, a number that has dramatically increased over the past decade.
Mother Jones reports that the packaging will now read:
"Studies suggest that Norlevo is less effective in women weighing [165 pounds] or more and not effective in women weighing [176 pounds] or more" and that Norlevo "is not recommended…if you weigh [165 pounds] or more"

...though the company's website hasn't updated their product information to indicate as much yet.
American manufacturers for similar pills like Teva, which produces Plan B, wouldn't comment on whether they'd be making the same recommendation to their consumers. According to FDA regulations, in order for all brands to make this change, major manufacturers would have to note it on their packaging first before generic brands could do the same.
Whether a version of Plan B that has the right amount of levonorgestrel in it to be effective for women of all body sizes is unclear; just increasing the amount of the hormone apparently won't work and many other hormones are considered less effective and often induce nausea. This news is about as disheartening as it gets: the big drama as far as the morning after pill is concerned has been centered around whether or not women can even get access to emergency contraception in the first place. So the idea that once they get their hands on it, it doesn't even work leaves us with not much else but ughhhhhhhhh.

New Warning: Morning-After Pill Doesn't Work for Women Over 176 Pounds [Mother Jones]

Amphetamine-related drugs, such as 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) and methamphetamine (METH), are popular recreational psychostimulants. Several preclinical studies have demonstrated that, besides having the potential for abuse, amphetamine-related drugs may also elicit neurotoxic and neuroinflammatory effects. The neurotoxic potentials of MDMA and METH to dopaminergic and serotonergic neurons have been clearly demonstrated in both rodents and non-human primates. This review summarizes the species-specific cellular and molecular mechanisms involved in MDMA and METH-mediated neurotoxic and neuroinflammatory effects, along with the most important behavioral changes elicited by these substances in experimental animals and humans. Emphasis is placed on the neuropsychological and neurological consequences associated with the neuronal damage. Moreover, we point out the gap in our knowledge and the need for developing appropriate therapeutic strategies to manage the neurological problems associated with amphetamine-related drug abuse.
A five minute job it said…
Only five minutes!
Why not add side slip whilst fixing the other issues?
Come on it won't take long….
What's 5 minutes between you and me?
That ‘five minute' job took around a day to code. That's the last time I listen to my brain! 😛
But we now have the ability for units to side slip.
What is side slipping?
It's the ability for a unit to move or charge forward whilst slipping the whole formation either left or right.
Ancient units used side slipping where it could replace wheeling as it didn't take as long and didn't affect cohesion as much. But unlike wheeling, side slips are limited by unit type, training, formation density and unit speed.
So not all units will be able to side slip very well.
Why did side slipping take so long to implement?
The image above shows one reason why there were a few technical hiccups. Who would have thought that a side-slipping unit's actual course is actually slightly different from the order arrow? Not me! 🙄
Of course (pardon the pun), that's just a simple ‘trivial' case.
Once you start adding lots of other orders, such as wheeling, the calculations get exceedingly hairy indeed!
But after a day of solid work it all seems to work across multiple orders and formation shapes. 😎
Although side slipping has accidentally stolen the limelight this week, the real bulk of the work was fixing the issues introduced from the formation changes that were added last week.
I have a policy of not starting any new functionality (side slipping excused), until I get the outstanding issues under control. As can be seen from the graph, I still have a little ways to go before I have a clean system ready for adding road travel functionality.
So what were the ‘outstanding' issues that I had to fix?
Many of them came about from required functionality that I had simply not thought about for formation changes….
There were other issues too. Such as removing the ability for a player to delete a change formation order if a unit is already in the middle of carrying it out.
All these smallish issues were issues that were not necessarily thought about up front, but are needed to make the change formation functionality usable.
In addition, as a bonus, I fixed the graphical anomalies on unformed units!
Regular readers will be thinking, ‘But you already fixed that?' Well I thought I had, mainly because I couldn't see the issue on my development machine.
Further investigation revealed that the corruption was down to the way I was dynamically calculating index buffers for the units. On AMD hardware (my dev machine) it worked perfectly, but on my games machine which has nVidia hardware it caused the occasional graphical issue.
I have since re-coded how the index buffers are calculated using a much safer algorithm and now, finally, everything is back and working again! Woot! 😀
I even managed to spend a little time on cleaning up the wheeling orders graphic…
The older symbology used to have a solid line that was drawn perpendicular to the unit that connected the pivot point to the endpoint of the unit. However, these days, the order graphic shows a shadow of the unit, so there is no need for this line to be displayed anymore!
That's it for this week. For the next week I will carry on stabilising the system, and once it is ready I will start on the new road travel functionality.
Some people might be thinking that this is a slow way of going about software development, but in my view if you don't stay on top of an application's quality it will soon get on top of you!
Anyways, I will leave you with a short video demonstrating what unit side slipping is. Best viewed in HD.

Stylistically, this week's two Champions League semi-finals were easy to categorise – Bayern Munich against Barcelona was supposedly a clash of two possession-based sides, Dortmund's meeting with Real Madrid about quick counterattacking. In the end, there was a clear similarity in the German triumphs – they both imposed their physique and energy on the game, to stifle the Spanish sides' creativity and burst forward into attack relentlessly.
This tactical battle was all about tempo. José Mourinho's decision to play Luka Modric ahead of Angel Di María altered Real's approach. The Argentinian winger's wife gave birth this week, which had put his participation in doubt, although it is difficult to believe a key player such as Cristiano Ronaldo or Xabi Alonso would have been omitted in similar circumstances. Modric was supposed to offer extra guile and creativity: a third playmaker along with Alonso and Mesut Ozil, who was moved to the right.
But Dortmund wanted a fast-paced game based around pressing and quick transitions, and either side's period of dominance fitted this pattern. The first 10 minutes were incredibly quick as Dortmund forced Real into aimless long balls downfield and pressed intensely in midfield to win the ball instantly, springing forward to put Real's centre-backs under immediate pressure. Robert Lewandowski's opener arrived after only eight minutes but the goal had been coming.
Alonso struggled to cope with Mario Götze's movement, with the Bayern-bound playmaker drifting either side of him to overload Real in wide areas. The fluidity from the Dortmund front four was marvellous. The wingers Marco Reus and Jakub Blaszczykowki often darted into the middle without problems with congestion and, although Dortmund's forward running was primarily impressive because of the stamina levels, there was also an admirable selflessness about the decoy movement.
The pace of top-level matches generally decreases after around 10 minutes but the effect was particularly obvious here. Dortmund were too passive after their goal, allowing the Real centre-backs Pepe and Raphaël Varane to grow into the contest after a nervy start. In the opening moments, Dortmund used Lewandowski and Götze cleverly, with both dropping off to deny Alonso time on the ball. Their defensive discipline declined significantly as the first half progressed, however, and whereas Alonso's passing was sloppy in the opening moments, he was given licence to conduct the game before half-time. Gradually, Real's passing improved in the buildup to Ronaldo's equaliser.
It seemed like Dortmund required Jürgen Klopp to underline their strategy at half-time, because the home side started the second period with another burst of energy. Ilkay Gundogan was crucial during this spell, with the young German replicating the powerful box-to-box role Bayern Munich's Javi Martínez played the previous night. Reus's dribbling ability was another key factor in driving Dortmund forward, and whereas in previous rounds Lewandowski has dropped deep to link play, this time he left creativity to others and concentrated on working as a ruthless penalty box poacher.
It would be easy to suggest Real's problem was their inability to match Dortmund's running – but the point, of course, was that they were attempting to connect midfield and attack through technique and creativity instead. Alonso, Modric and Ozil had decent individual moments but in a relatively unfamiliar starting shape Real lacked cohesion with their movement and passing, and neither Gonzalo Higuaín nor the substitute Karim Benzema could match the class of Lewandowski.
According to court documents 'Numerous members of law enforcement witnessed the defendant's attack on an FBI Special Agent with a large kitchen knife (pictured).' (U.S. Department of Justice)
STATEN ISLAND, N.Y.-- A Mariners Harbor man who allegedly hid a knife in case the FBI showed up has admitted he was trying to help the foreign terrorist group ISIS.
Fareed Mumuni, 22, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to provide material support to ISIS and attempting to murder federal officers during his appearance in Brooklyn federal court Thursday.
"He pled because it's his right," Mumuni's lawyer, Kenneth Montgomery, told the Advance.
Mumuni tried to plunge a kitchen knife into the chest of an FBI special agent executing a search warrant on his Mersereau Avenue home on June 17, 2015, according to federal prosecutors.
The agent survived the attack -- authorities said Mumuni's knife couldn't get through the agent's body armor.
"By lunging with a knife, I knew that if I succeeded I could kill him," Mumuni said, according to Reuters.
"The defendant used a deadly or dangerous weapon to commit such acts," federal prosecutors said.
He was arrested that day, and later pleaded not guilty to providing material support to ISIS and conspiring to assault federal officers.
On Thursday, Mumuni, a U.S. citizen originally from Ghana, also pleaded guilty to conspiracy to assault federal officers, attempting to provide material support to a foreign terrorist organization and assault on federal officers, said prosecutors.
According to the initial complaint against him, Mumuni had "pledged allegiance" to the Islamic State group and kept a knife in case the FBI showed up.
In court, Mumuni said he discussed traveling overseas to join the Islamic State, Reuters reported.
Mumuni's co-defendant, Munther Omar Saleh, of Queens, is expected to plead guilty Friday in Brooklyn federal court, according to a court spokesman.
Saleh is accused of charging, knife in hand, at a law enforcement officer on June 13. He's also accused of plotting to build and detonate pressure-cooker bombs.
Saleh was a student at Vaughn College of Aeronautics and Technology in Queens, and Mumuni was studying sociology and anthropology at the College of Staten Island.
Mumuni will be sentenced May 16 and is facing up to 85 years in prison.
DDT's massive summer show Peter Pan at Sumo Hall in Ryogoku is upon us.
If you've noticed the recent slew of DDT reviews I've done for the website, it's all been in preparation for this show. The sheer amount of storytelling that DDT has woven throughout the promotion since their five hour epic Judgment Day culminates in this, a clashing of the men and women of DDT up and down the card. A fallen warrior finally returns, a war for love will be fought, and two titans will stand across the ring from each other with DDT's most prestigious and important title on the line. There are special guests, young men striving to prove their worth, and a match that pits easily half of the roster against each other in search for one of the most elusive titles in DDT.
Let's get started.
DNA Fights— Battle Of Last Summer
Kazusada Higuchi & Daiki Shimomura vs. Kouki Iwasaki & Mizuki Watase
Higuchi is one of the most impressive young talents in DDT and in DNA, his size and strength giving him an advantage over his fellow trainees. In DDT, he's managed to find some success as he won the Right to Challenge battle royal at Judgment Day and was a reigning KO-D six-man champion with Shunma Katsumata and one of his opponents here, Kouki Iwasaki. Shimomura has returned from injury recently and despite this setback early in his career, he's looked good in his returning matches and shows a lot of talent and skill. Kouki Iwasaki has chest-shattering kicks and isn't afraid to dish them out in great intensity and number, plus he and his former partners Tomomitsu Matsunaga and Gota Ihashi have recently reformed their former stable, naming it Pigging 2016. It's good to see Mizuki Watase getting a match, too, instead of just being relegated to an interference in a match further up the card. These four will put on a great show, as the DNA boys nearly always work well together no matter what the teams are, but Higuchi picking up the win seems obvious here, as he'll likely start climbing his way back up the card to close in on where he was just a few short months ago. Prediction: Higuchi & Shimomura
Iron Man Heavymetalweight Title— Battle Royal
Toru Owashi (c) vs. Joey Ryan, Reika Saki, Keisuke Ishii, Saki Akai, Kazuki Hirata, Cherry, Guanchulo, Mad Polly, Kenso, Gota Ihashi, Jun Kasai & Yoshihiko
As of the DramaticDDT preview, Joey Ryan was the current champion. As of this writing, he has been defeated by Guanchulo, who was then defeated by Toru Owashi. By the time this match actually comes, we could very well have had ten more champions by then, so don't take who is champion going into this match too seriously. After Joey Ryan pinned Saki Akai for the title, he took it to America and documented its adventures as different wrestlers, people, and even a cat found themselves winning the title. Above, I mentioned this title being elusive— And that it is, because there's even been confusion about whom the current champion is when challengers show up for the belt. This battle royal is going to be madness, and comedy, and Kenso is here, so it's going to be a fun time. Even better, the best deathmatch wrestler in the world JUN KASAI is showing up, and so is YOSHIHIKO. A truly star-studded event, and Joey Ryan. It doesn't really matter who wins, but I'm going to say Kenso because it would be funny to see Sanshiro Takagi's reaction to that. Prediction: Kenso
KUDO Comeback— Yellow Dragon Come Back
Kudo & Masahiro Takanashi vs. Akito & Yasu Urano
It's weird to think about how the last match Kudo participated in before his injury was a NOAH tag where he and Kota Umeda fell to Yoshinari Ogawa and Zack Sabre Jr. It's been a long, long road without him as a member of Shuten-doji and the group has not just felt the same without him there to throw his strikes and kicks by their side. They endeavored to win the six-man titles together in Kudo's honor but failed to do so. Now, Kudo is back and based on what we saw during Beer Garden, he's in great shape. He tags here with Masahiro Takanashi to take on Smile Squash members Yasu Urano and Akito. These four men know each other incredibly well and have an insane amount of chemistry in the ring as they are four of the very best of DDT, and that's saying something considering almost everyone in DDT is amazing at what they do. Not everyone wins their first match back but I feel like Kudo will, just the same. Prediction: Shuten-doji
NωA Road To DDT Fes 2016— Sasadango Teaches The Way To Survive Showbiz: Makoto
Oishi, MAO, Shunma Katsumata & Super Sasadango Machine vs. Antonio Honda, Trans-Am ★ Hiroshi, Ladybeard & Gorgeous Matsuno
What you really need to know about this match is that there's going to be a lot of singing as our fledgling idol group takes on a quartet of incredible vocalists alongside their new manager. After a match on the Danshoku Dino Beer Garden show, Shunma Katsumata was named the leader of the group and so they have some direction going for them. They've also shown incredibly growth as a trio in the short amount of time they have been together, able to execute team maneuvers with ease and fluidity. It's good, because they're going to need it. While their opponents aren't necessarily the most cohesive team in the world, Honda and Hiroshi have powerful voices and have been known to fight out of submission holds with their singing. Ladybeard might seem cute and harmless, but he's a heavy metal vocalist who has wrestling matches between songs during his sets in clubs. And Matsuno has a beautiful crooning voice. The variety that NωA faces here is going to be tough for them, but this is probably where they start to turn things around, defeating their opponents and getting one step closer to that November show. Prediction: NωA w/ SSM
AJPW World Jr. Heavyweight Title
Hikaru Sato (c) vs. Soma Takao
This is where things start to get serious. Soma Takao found himself warring with former partner and stablemate Keisuke Ishii in an effort to get a shot at taking on Hikaru Sato. Ishii had been a former trainee in All Japan who left the company and has been pursuing a title there ever since. Takao was not about to take this challenge laying down and the two of them ended up in a match together to determine who had the right to challenge Sato. Takao won, and the challenge was made. Sato came personally to accept the challenge and schedule it for Peter Pan, and these two have been clashing since then.
Every time they're involved in a match, it ends in a brawl. During Beer Garden, Sato locked in an armbar on Takao and had to be pried off of him by the young boys of DNA because he refused to relinquish the hold. Despite having had a lot of tough luck before coming by this title, Sato is a tough and vicious opponent with a seemingly endless array of counters, reversals, and submission holds that he can tap into at any moment. Takao has been the shining star of Team Dream Futures since the three of them decided to split up, but this is one of his biggest challenges to date. I don't think I see him winning here, though. AJPW clearly put this title on Sato for a reason, and it doesn't feel like it's time for him to lose it just yet. Prediction: Hikaru Sato
DDT Extreme Title— Watase Contra Watase
LiLiCo (c) vs. Danshoku Dino
When LiLiCo appeared at the New Years show at the beginning of the year and choked Saki Akai out with a chair, nobody could have predicted she would end up defending the Extreme Title on the Peter Pan show. It was her feud with Saki Akai that led her to meeting Mizuki Watase, as she needed teammates for a six-man match with the Kawaii Connection. Ever since then, she and Watase have been inseparable and their connection to each other has been strong. He awoke LiLiCo with a true love's kiss and that led her to challenging then-champion Super Sasadango Machine for this title.
With the help of her love Watase, LiLiCo won the match and has been unstoppable ever since then, crushing first challenger Makoto Oishi beneath her boot. Dino appeared to challenge for the title next, insisting that the relationship between Watase and LiLiCo is a publicity stunt, adding later that he believes Watase is gay and is hiding that by dating LiLiCo. He's allowed to interfere in this match, and whether that means aiding the woman he loves in another title defense or perhaps revealing his true sexuality, we just don't know. It's DDT, and if the past has taught us absolutely anything, it's that anything can happen in DDT. I don't know. My heart says LiLiCo, but my brain, unfortunately, says Dino. This is the one time I hope I'm wrong. Prediction: Danshoku Dino
Special Six-Man Tag Team Match
Sanshiro Takagi, Shiro Koshinaka & Nosawa Rongai vs. Great Kabuki, Yukio Sakaguchi & Kota Umeda
This match was supposed to be a match to go hand-in-hand with the singles match between Nosawa and Terry Funk at the Tokyo Carnival show. Instead, Terry Funk was hit with a hernia and could not make the trip to Japan. He was replaced with the Great Kabuki in what is clearly a challenge to see who can paint their face the most outlandishly between Kabuki and Nosawa. Shiro Koshinaka is also here after having faded out of the picture since his last match in Kaientai Dojo, and he promises to be an entertaining addition to this match. Sanshiro Takagi is here, and since this match will so clearly have comedy in it, I hope this means everyone has to oversell his stunners even if that means including his own partners, too. Nothing is as good as someone overselling his stunners. Yukio and Kota are amazing, there's no other way to describe them, and seeing them tag with Kabuki is going to be a fun time. Prediction: The Great Kabuki, Yukio Sakaguchi & Kota Umeda
Special Tag Match
Dick Togo & Mike Bailey vs. Daisuke Sasaki & Tetsuya Endo
Dick Togo returned to wrestling this year, back and better than ever. His matches have been fun to watch and prove that even though he spent years away from the ring, nothing has really changed and he's as good as he's ever been. In great shape and happy to fight the new wrestlers, he's shown he's incredible working with the DNA boys especially and has adapted easily to find ways around their styles. It was after one of these matches that Daisuke Sasaki, his protege, entered the ring to welcome him back. But Sasaki has changed and gave Togo a low blow, kickstarting their feud.
He brings Tetsuya Endo with him to the table, the former partner of Konosuke Takeshita who turned his back on Takeshita and Happy Motel to join Damnation and try to find the path to the top that has constantly alluded him despite his seemingly the best efforts. He's grown an edge to him since that match and looks to unleash it here as he helps his new partner defeat Togo. But Togo hasn't come alone. He brings foreign import Mike “Speedball” Bailey, the Canadian Karate Kid with amazing kicks and the ability to soar through the air as if gravity just doesn't exist. Bailey has been impressing everyone in DDT lately and looks to continue the trend here as he teams with Togo to try to slow Damnation from crashing through everyone and everything in their path. Prediction: Dick Togo & Mike Bailey
KO-D Tag Team Titles
Ken Ohka & KAI (c) vs. Harashima & Yuko Miyamoto
In a case of oddball tag teams working out to be the best partners ever, we have these two teams. Ken Ohka found himself opposite Harashima earlier this year when he cashed in his Right to Challenge contract for the KO-D title match with then-champion Harashima, and despite his best efforts, he was unable to overcome the ace of DDT. Kai had a great year going for him, winning the KO-D tag team titles while he was still Wrestle-1 champion, but he's since been defeated by Daiki Inaba in what was a shocking turn of events given Inaba is crowned a super rookie (whether that's accurate or not). The two of them are underdogs at heart, and that makes for a great story, but Harashima and Yuko are two of the best wrestlers in DDT. Yuko Miyamoto is a decorated worker who has found himself an amazing partner in Harashima, and despite being so different, the two of them have come together to form Yankee Smile and have had great matches when they're side by side. If they can defeat Bad Comi here, they become KO-D tag team champions together. I want to believe the underdog story so bad because Ohka and Kai are GREAT but Harashima and Yuko deserve their due for being a great team, too. Prediction: Harashima & Yuko Miyamoto (Yankee Smile)
KO-D Openweight Title
Konosuke Takeshita (c) vs. Shuji Ishikawa
Shuji Ishikawa has levelled DDT since he was introduced as Daisuke Sasaki's new tag team partner. After Kota Ibushi sustained an injury and announced he was not returning to DDT, and Suguru Miyatake sustained an injury, Sasaki had been without a partner. Finally, he found one in Shuji Ishikawa, renaming him Adrian and introducing him as his new partner. While there have been some dubious reactions to Sasaki leading Ishikawa to the ring on a leash and collar, there can be no doubt as to how effective Ishikawa has been. He and Sasaki defeated Happy Motel tag team Konosuke Takeshita and Tetsuya Endo for their tag titles, then successfully defended the titles against them when Sasaki defeated Takeshita twice with his crossface submission. When the King of DDT tournament came, Ishikawa entered and destroyed each and every one of his opponent's so he could win the tournament, make Sasaki proud, and, of course, earn a hug. Takeshita holds a 4 minute victory over him that he's likely very eager to avenge, and his loyalty to Sasaki means he will go into this match and leave nothing left on the table.
But Konosuke Takeshita is no one to take lightly. After defeating Sasaki for the KO-D title, he's been a shining example of a young champion stepping comfortably into the spotlight. He's had amazing defenses against Yuko Miyamoto, Toru Owashi, and his own former best friend Tetsuya Endo. With each defense, he's learned a little more and grown a little stronger, and he has refused to back down every time he finds himself facing any adversity. He may be young, and he may still have a lot to learn and some charisma to find along the way, Takeshita has been a hell of a champion and will have a great match here with Ishikawa. The two of them have had great chemistry the last times they've clashed and the intensity between them when they step into the ring is tangible. Takeshita will probably retain here, putting down another member of Damnation in the process and proving that he really is every bit the champion he seems. Prediction: Konosuke Takeshita
‘Hidden' version of the US investigative outlet's site is response to concerns about online privacy and surveillance
The US investigative outlet ProPublica has launched the world's first major news site designed for the dark web in a bid to provide absolute privacy for its readers.
The non-profit organisation has set up a version of its site optimised for use over the Tor network, which provides security all the way between the user and Pro Publica's servers. Users could already hide their identity using the Tor browser, but the “hidden site” optimised for the network makes it even less likely they will be exposed.
Though some people use the anonymity Tor provides to carry out illegal activity such as buying and selling drugs, it was designed to help activists living under repressive regimes to communicate free of government surveillance.
The ProPublica developer Mike Tigas told Wired the decision to launch the site stemmed from concerns about whether or not Chinese internet users would be safe reading its reporting of online censorship in the country.
He also said it would ensure that anyone choose to leak information to ProPublica via its secure drop services would also be able to read the rest of the site without fear of being tracked.
“Everyone should have the ability to decide what types of metadata they leave behind,” Tigas said.
The move reflects heightened concerns about both government surveillance and the way companies track people on the internet. Last year, the Intercept, which was founded as part of the eBay co-founder Pierre Omidyar's First Look publishing operation, decided to add new privacy features into the software it uses to analyse its audience.

For years, Dutch cities have been building protected intersections: crossings that are designed to reduce the risk of cyclists getting hit by turning cars. Last week, in Davis, California, the very first protected intersection opened for traffic in the US — and it's gotten positive reviews from locals so far.
The rationale for these new intersections is straightforward. Protected bike lanes — which are physically separated from the street by a curb or other barrier and have spread widely in the US over the past decade — have significantly cut down on cyclist injuries and deaths. But even on streets that have them, cyclists still have to ride through intersections right next to car traffic — and evidence suggests that the majority of crashes occur at intersections, when turning cars are most likely to hit them.
Protected intersections solve this problem with separated channels for cyclists to ride through. They also orient drivers so that they can more easily see pedestrians and bikes when they're turning. As Michael Andersen at People for Bikes puts it, "Instead of forcing people in cars and on bikes alike to look constantly over their shoulders for one another, protected intersections arrange traffic so that everyone can see what's going on simply by looking forward."
How the new protected intersection works
Davis's new intersection is intended to solve one big problem in particular: when a cyclist, going straight, is next to a car that's turning right.
With most protected bike lanes, the barrier disappears at the intersection. Right-turning cars either mingle with bike traffic or are forced to merge through it — both of which require drivers to spot bikes in their mirrors and avoid them. Often they don't see cyclists, leading to a type of accident called the right hook.
Davis's new intersection — like the ones in the Netherlands — includes special islands at the corners. Cyclists going straight can ride to the right of them, and the islands' shape ensures that right-turning cars will encounter these cyclists straight on. Instead of looking over their shoulders to see bikes, drivers see them directly in front of their windshields.
The islands also make pedestrians more visible to drivers in the same way and give them a shorter distance to walk when crossing the street. And the islands force cars to take turns more slowly, further reducing the chance of a crash.
Finally, the intersection gives cyclists a new safer, slower option for making one of the more dangerous moves: a left turn. While they can still merge over to the turning lane and turn left through the intersection like a car (the top blue line in the diagram above), they can alternatively act a bit more like a pedestrian, proceeding across the intersection, then crossing it again at a perpendicular angle after the light has turned (the bottom blue line).
Many cyclists do this already — it's called a hook turn — but the new design makes both legs of this maneuver safer.
Why infrastructure design is so important
Davis isn't the only city building protected intersections: Austin has one in an as-yet-undeveloped subdivision, and Boston and Salt Lake City have plans to build several over the next few years. All this is part of a boom in bike-specific infrastructure across the US, as many cities try to get more people to bike and walk to cut down on traffic.
It's happening for a good reason. Plenty of research shows that the presence of protected bike lanes, for instance, is one of the strongest factors that make people willing to try biking in a city. The world's cities with the highest rates of bicycling — such as Copenhagen and Amsterdam — have the highest amounts of protected bike lanes and trails, and research shows this correlation also holds for US cities. Davis, which has held the US title for the highest percentage of bike commuters for decades and has an extensive bike lane network, is the perfect example of this.
The basic reason is that absent this infrastructure, roads across the US are often designed solely with cars in mind. There might be a core group of hardcore bikers who are willing to ride right next to car traffic, but it's pretty small — and reaching new people requires intentionally designing roads to make biking safe.
Martha Roskowski of the advocacy group People for Bikes has a great analogy for this idea. Riding a bike in the streets, like a car, is akin to skiing a black diamond run down a mountain. A minority of bikers might do it (and even enjoy it), but to make most people comfortable with the idea of biking in a city, we need the equivalent of green circle and blue square ski routes — protected lanes and intersections. More importantly, these need to make up a linked, cohesive system, so people can bike from home to work, for instance, without needing to brave a black diamond along the way.

SYFY ACQUIRES HIT NEW ZEALAND ORIGINAL SERIES THE ALMIGHTY JOHNSONS FROM ALL3MEDIA INTERNATIONAL
THE ALMIGHTY JOHNSONS – ABOUT FOUR BROTHERS WITH THE POWERS OF NORSE GODS – WILL PREMIERE IN 2014
NEW YORK – August 13, 2013 — Expanding its stable of international hits such as Lost Girl and Continuum, Syfy today announced it has acquired the first two seasons (23 episodes) of the popular New Zealand scripted series The Almighty Johnsons from independent television distributor ALL3MEDIA International.
The Almighty Johnsons is a production of South Pacific Pictures.

The action-packed comedy drama The Almighty Johnsons follows the Johnson boys, four typical fun-loving guys – who have inherited the power of Norse Gods. But these four brothers are no flashy superheroes. Everyday Gods have everyday struggles – searching for love, overcoming sibling rivalry and fulfilling their God-like destiny – while still enjoying a few beers with their mates.
Chris Regina, Senior Vice President, Programming, Syfy, said: “We're delighted to introduce quality New Zealand programming to the Syfy audience. A compelling blend of fantasy and comedy, this quirky series should resonate strongly with our viewers.”
Kelly Martin, CEO, South Pacific Pictures, said: “We are thrilled with the deal that ALL3MEDIA International has done. The Almighty Johnsons will be the first wholly New Zealand originated and produced drama series to be broadcast in the United States, which is a terrific accomplishment and reflects the quality of the series.”
Louise Pedersen, Managing Director, ALL3MEDIA International, added: “This acquisition by an influential market such as the United States will be fantastic for the profile of The Almighty Johnsons and New Zealand drama on the global stage.”
Syfy is a media destination for imagination-based entertainment. With year round acclaimed original series, events, blockbuster movies, classic science fiction and fantasy programming, a dynamic Web site (www.Syfy.com), and a portfolio of adjacent business (Syfy Ventures), Syfy is a passport to limitless possibilities. Originally launched in 1992 as SCI FI Channel, and currently in more than 98 million homes, Syfy is a network of NBCUniversal, one of the world's leading media and entertainment companies. NBCUniversal is owned by Comcast Corporation.(Syfy. Imagine greater.)
The advances in artificial intelligence and the rise of businesses that develop and employ chat-based bots mean that it gets increasingly hard to know whether you are dealing with a machine or a human being. The technology behind bots has gotten so sophisticated that it can require a longer conversation in order to be sure that there is no person of flesh and blood on the other end, as illustrated in this exchange with a Google support “employee” which I linked to in yesterday's reading list. Basically, one has to run somewhat of a freestyle Turing Test. In other cases, the opposite happens: Users assume they are interacting with a machine, but in fact are having a chat with a real-human who only pretends to be a bot. An “Anti-Turing-Test”, as conducted in this example with Facebook's experimental personal assistant M, can reveal this.
Bots pretending to be humans, humans pretending to be bots – sounds a bit bizarre, doesn't it? Here is something else bizarre:
Think about what's typical for a contemporary chatbot, those being used by large companies for customer service such as in the example above by Google, or by telecom operators (I recently had a chat interaction with T-Mobile which made me suspicious that I was conversing with a machine pretending to be a human):
Their messages seem prefabricated, built from pre-existing content blocks.
They are predictable, especially after you had a longer conversation with them.
They sometimes fail to fully address the inquiry, especially if it's complex.
They don't get irony and don't respond well to nor have humor.
They usually don't write long text but stick to 1 or 2 sentences at once.
Now, don't you know this from somewhere?
Yep, this is a quite accurate description of what's going on on Twitter. And I am not referring to the actual bots that are populating the service. I am referring to real humans. To some extend, Twitter, with its 140-character limit and its encouragement of instantness and impulsive comments, has turned its users into bot-like creatures, who keep tweeting the same lines, the same reactions, the same ideas, the same arguments. If you are a Twitter user and don't believe this, just type “[often used word(s)] from:yourusername” into Twitter search. Looking at my own results was pretty uncomfortable.
Sure, there is more humor and irony on Twitter than what you can expect from the encounter with a customer service bot. But only among a subset of users. And only as long as the discussion doesn't touch sensitive topics such as [enter random object of outrage]. If that happens, everyone sticks to their pre-fabricated text blocks and appears to follow a very narrow conversation protocol.
The root cause of this is obviously not Twitter, but the human mind. Conversations on Facebook or other text-based Social Media platforms sometimes also look like strange interactions between bots. But the 140-character limit of Twitter forces people into a corset which makes it hard not to appear like a bot; to be unpredictable, to be sophisticated, to acknowledge complexity, to maintain a sense of humor.
Twitter recently announced that it will raise the character limit. In my opinion, it's the right move. In a time in which bots get constantly better in imitating humans, there is nothing to gain with a service which makes humans in public look like bots.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Prime Minister Narendra Modi will take border settlement and water sharing deals to Bangladesh next month as part of his drive to erode Chinese influence in South Asia, although Dhaka is likely to remain dependant on Beijing for military equipment.

India, which has had an uneasy relationship with China for decades, has long fretted over Beijing's military cooperation with its South Asian neighbours, especially Pakistan.
It is also worried China is creating a so-called “string of pearls” across the Indian Ocean by funding port developments in Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Myanmar and Bangladesh.
Modi has won parliamentary approval for an agreement that will transfer a small amount of territory to Bangladesh that previous Indian governments failed to ratify for fear of a domestic backlash. The issue dates back to British India's partition in 1947.
The prime minister has also persuaded a regional Indian leader to drop her opposition to share water equally from a key river that flows through India before reaching Bangladesh.
“There have been some contentious issues like the land border agreement which, frankly, we should have done years ago,” said an Indian official involved in Modi's June 6-7 visit.
The migration of tens of thousands of people from Bangladesh into India has long been a sensitive issue in India, with Modi's Hindu nationalist party making it a key campaign plank.
But since coming to power, Modi has fallen silent on the migration issue and has instead focussed on securing India's strategic objectives in Bangladesh.
Srikanth Kondapalli, a China expert at New Delhi's Jawaharlal Nehru University, said China had built close ties with Bangladesh as part of its South Asia diplomacy and that this was a concern for India.
“The number of PLA visits to Bangladesh is nearly the same as to India,” he said, referring to China's People's Liberation Army. “Modi is trying to counter it with his neighbourhood outreach.”
CHINESE PLANES, MISSILES AND SUBS
Modi has reached out to all of India's neighbours since he took office a year ago except Pakistan.
But any Indian concerns about Bangladesh's growing military ties to China, including the planned sale of two Chinese diesel-electric submarines, are likely to fall on deaf ears in Dhaka, said a former Bangladeshi military officer and an Indian expert.
China was the source of 82 percent of Bangladesh's arms purchases from 2009-2013, according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), making Dhaka one of the top three buyers of Chinese weapons in the world.
SIPRI data showed Bangladesh bought anti-ship missiles, tanks, fighter aircraft and other arms from China between 2008 and 2012. Last year it commissioned two new frigates from China.
“China became the largest supplier of military hardware to Bangladesh when relations with India were strained,” said retired Bangladeshi brigadier general Shahedul Anam Khan.
A government official in Dhaka said Bangladesh's first submarines, costing $206 million in total, could be delivered before 2019. China was expected to provide training, said Chinese experts on the country's ties with South Asia.
What worries Indian military planners is that China might see Bangladesh, which shares the Bay of Bengal with India and Myanmar, as an ideal place for its warships and submarines to dock.
India was alarmed last year when Chinese submarines did the same in Sri Lanka. A new government in Colombo has since ruled out submarine visits in the near future.
China's Defence Ministry's had no immediate comment on military ties with Bangladesh. Cooperation between the two countries was normal, China's Foreign Ministry said.
Bangladesh has never hosted a naval ship from China and has no plans to, according to a government official.
PORT ASSISTANCE
China is helping Bangladesh upgrade its main Chittagong port while the China Harbour Engineering Company has been seen as the frontrunner to win a contract to build an $8 billion deep water port on Sonadia island off the Bangladeshi city of Cox's Bazaar in the Bay of Bengal.
India's Adani Group is also bidding for the project.
The Bangladeshi government official said it was unclear when a decision on Sonadia would be made, adding that port operators from the United Arab Emirates and the Netherlands were also interested.
“China, in my opinion, is the best option,” said Munshi Faiz Ahmad, a former Bangladesh ambassador to China, adding that Chinese firms had built big infrastructure projects in a number of countries including Bangladesh, where they have constructed power plants, bridges and roads.
The Indian navy is watching China's growing military ties with Bangladesh closely.
It's setting up missile batteries and radar surveillance on Sagar island, near the Indian-Bangladesh border, with plans to develop a deep sea port there that would provide easy access to the Bay of Bengal, military officials said.
“The worry is not Bangladesh's military capabilities,” said former Indian ambassador to Dhaka, Pinaki Chakravarty. “It is about Chinese influence next door.”
Justin Brierley, the unfailingly polite host of the British radio program, Unbelievable, recently podcast the entirety of his hour-long interview with Mark Driscoll.
Things did not go well.
There are many moments in this interview that could provide fodder for discussion. For example, Christians in the UK may be rather nonplussed by Driscoll impugning their entire country for not having, well, Mark Driscoll:
Driscoll: I go too far sometimes. Almost every other pastor I know doesn't go far enough and that's okay 'cause the church tends to be led by people who are timid and fearful of going too far. I mean, let's just say this. … Right now, name for me the one young good Bible teacher that's known across Great Britain.
Brierley: Hmm …
Driscoll: You don't have one. That is a problem. There are a bunch of cowards who aren't telling the truth.
Brierley: So you think that the Bible teaches …
Driscoll: You don't have one. You don't have one young guy who can preach the Bible that anybody's listening to on the whole earth.
I'll leave it to the Brits to decide whether their churches suffer from a glut of cowards and a want of controversial celebrity preachers.
Much of the interview revolved around Driscoll's views on women and their role in marriage and the church. When Brierley confessed that his own wife is, in fact, the pastor of his church, things got incredibly awkward:
Driscoll: I'm not shocked by the answer, by the questions you ask. I love you, but you're annoying. ‘Cause you're picking on all the same issues that those who are classically evangelical, kind of liberal, kind of feminist do.
Brierley: I think it's because those are the issues here that people are thinking about. … [Brierley says he's impressed by much of what Mars Hill Church is doing].
Driscoll: Kay, let me ask you a few hard questions.
Brierley: Go ahead, go ahead.
Driscoll: So, in the church that your wife pastors, how many young men have come to Christ in the last year?
[It's clear from the tone of Driscoll's question that this is not a bona fide inquiry about the souls in Brierley's church. It's a veiled criticism. Driscoll is going to prove that women pastors can't get the job done (i.e. attracting men to the church) and he's going to belittle Brierley's wife & church to do it.]
Brierley: Well we're not a huge church, unlike yours, but I'd say there's two or three probably in the last year who certainly, yah, I'd say have come to Christ in a pretty meaningful way.
Driscoll: Okay and in the church, what percentage is young men, single men?
Brierley: It's difficult to say off the top of my head, but I'll freely say it's certainly not a big percentage, no.
Driscoll: Kay, and are you okay with that? Do you think that's the best way to go?
Brierley: No, but can it be so easily put down to the fact that the church is being run by a woman? I mean, is that …
Driscoll: Yup. Yup. You look at your results, you look at my results, and you look at the variable that's most obvious.
[Yes, he did just say that. His results are better than hers. And it's because he's a man and she's a woman.]
Brierley: Well, in our case, the …
Driscoll: This is where the excuses come, not the verses. This is where the excuses come, not the verses.
Brierley: … Up to the point my wife took over, it had been run by men. Since she's come, lots of new families, lots of younger people, both men and women, have come. I wouldn't say the balance is right perfect yet by any means. But it's certainly a lot better than it ever was. And so I don't necessarily see quite the same situation that you paint there in terms of men not relating. I see more men in the church since she's been there than before she was there, in a way.
Driscoll: What kind of men? Strong men?
[The implication here is obvious. Only weak, limp-wristed mama's boys would be attracted to a church with a female leader, right? Tough men like Driscoll certainly wouldn't be. Brierley seems genuinely baffled by such a stupid question.]
Brierley: Well, men. I mean, men come in different shapes and sizes. I mean, yah, both really. Men who are very masculine, men who are, I guess, on a spectrum, more effeminate. But I couldn't say that there's been a sort of dearth of men in the church since she's arrived. I mean, Mark, I don't want to get into a sort of argument.
Driscoll: No, no, you don't want to sit in my seat, I understand. So does your wife do counseling with men? Sexual counseling? Does she talk about masturbation, pornography, the stuff that I do?
Brierley: Well no, she doesn't.
Driscoll: Well, who does talk to the men about those things, especially the young men?
Brierley: Well there are other people that she can pass them on to. We have male elders in our church who, you know, would be able to tackle those kinds of questions. I mean, but would you speak with those kinds of issues to a female in your church?
Driscoll: Uh no. If they're a married couple we might meet with them as a couple. But if it's a woman, we would have women leaders meet with them.
Brierley: Sure, well it's the same scenario in our church really.
Driscoll: Well except for who's in charge.
[This part is almost comical. Driscoll seems to think he's got a real zinger. If a woman is pastor, who's going to do all that important sex counseling that Driscoll seems so obsessed with? Faced with the rather obvious explanation that it's the same in Brierley's church as in his own (men counsel men and women counsel women) Driscoll insists that it's still not as good because the men aren't “in charge”.]
Brierley: Well what's wrong with… I mean, I agree, obviously theologically we're not on the same page here Mark in terms of…
Driscoll: Do you believe in a conscious literal eternal torment of hell?
Brierley: What has that got to do with the issue of women in leadership, if you don't mind me asking?
Driscoll: It does. It depends on your view of God. Is God like a mom who just embraces everyone? Or is he like a father who also protects, and defends, and disciplines? If you doesn't answer the question, I think I know the answer.
Driscoll goes on to grill Brierley about whether he believes in penal substitution. When Brierley replies that it's a valid way of understanding the meaning of the cross, Driscoll isn't satisfied, calls him a “coward”, and eventually tells him to stop “drinking decaf” and get “more courage”.
It's clear that Driscoll's male supremacy vibe has implications for all of his theology. Eternal conscious torment is a tough, manly doctrine and, therefore, superior to weak womanly ideas that don't involve a literal fiery hell. Real men, brave men espouse a penal substitution theory of atonement without reservation. Those who prefer a more nuanced understanding are effeminate cowards.
You see, if you have doctrinal differences with Mark Driscoll, you don't just disagree with him; you are inferior to him. And he's got the church-growth results to prove it.
There's so much more that could be said, but I'll leave that to others. Besides, given that I don't share Driscoll's doctrinal stances, I've probably got to go paint my nails or tease my hair or something.
**************************
[Edit: Based on a few of the comments I've received on this post, I want to add some clarification. I would be the first to agree that by no means is Driscoll this abrasive throughout the entire interview. Most of the time, he and Brierley got along fine (although I think the mood soured a bit at around the 17 minute mark when Driscoll called Brierley “immature” for asking what I thought was a perfectly legitimate question).
Some have wondered whether these quotes are taking Driscoll out of context. The first quote about the “cowards” in UK churches (28 minute mark) came in the context of Driscoll being asked if he regretted his Facebook comment that encouraged people to share stories about “effeminate anatomically male worship leaders”. He agreed that he had gone too far but then said what you see transcribed above. Seems beset with regret, doesn't he?
The transcribed portion of the interview about women takes you from 49:40 through 53:30. Everything is there (except a few lines by Brierley about admiring Mars Hill, which I summarized for brevity). My square bracketed interjections do not represent missing context. What you read above is the entire 4 minute exchange. Yes, there is context before and context after. But I fail to see how that minimizes the legitimate concerns about what he said in the middle. I can understand a one-liner being “taken out of context”. It's hard to take 4 solid minutes of conversation out of context. You can listen to the full interview here.]

The Senate voted on Monday evening, 72 to 27, to confirm Wilbur Ross as secretary of commerce. The 79-year-old billionaire private equity investor is President Donald Trump's 10th cabinet nominee to be confirmed, and remarkably, is the second member of Trump's cabinet who was deeply involved in companies that swept up the housing crisis with foreclosures marred by document fraud like robo-signing.
The first, Steven Mnuchin, Trump's treasury secretary, invested in and ran OneWest bank, which foreclosed on tens of thousands of Americans in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis. During his Senate confirmation hearing, he denied that his bank used the illegal practice of robo-signing, but public documents obtained by The Columbus Dispatch showed that was a false statement.
Ross may not have been the CEO of a bank foreclosing on homeowners, but he was nevertheless intimately involved and invested in two companies that were accused of widespread wrongdoing. American Home Mortgage Servicing was accused of illegal foreclosure practices while it ran the second-biggest portfolio of subprime mortgages in the country.
American Home effectively outsourced the fraud, David Dayen reported, using “a company called DocX, which forged millions of mortgage assignments, claiming to be the officers of dozens of different banks ... documents were fraudulently signed after the fact to recreate a chain of title that lenders broke.” The company was eventually sold to Ocwen, which was fined $2.1 billion in 2013 for its unethical business practices. Ross served on Ocwen's board from 2012 to 2014.
Not only is Ross a member of a secret Wall Street fraternity, where, clad in velvet slippers, he sang show tunes mocking poor people, but he also has pockmarks that would likely have sunk his nomination if he'd been put forward by another president for consideration by another Senate.
During his confirmation hearing, Ross admitted to employing an undocumented household worker for years. It was only after he was nominated by Trump to be commerce secretary that he asked all his “dozen or so” household employees to prove they were legally allowed to work in the U.S. “This one employee was unable to and therefore was terminated,” Ross said at his confirmation hearing. Hiring undocumented workers sank two of President Bill Clinton's nominees for attorney general and President George W. Bush's first choice for labor secretary pulled out after it emerged she had sheltered an undocumented woman.
Ross has also outsourced 2,700 U.S. jobs in companies he has invested in since 2004, Labor Department data published by Reuters shows. Reviewing his investment in International Textile Group, which under Ross' ownership rebranded and shed hundreds of American jobs, The Daily Beast dubbed him, “Trump's future secretary of outsourcing.”
And then there is Ross' involvement in the coal industry, which Trump talks about reviving at seemingly every opportunity. In 2005, Ross fully acquired a series of coal mines that he had long been the largest investor in. One of those properties was Sago Mine, which was hit with 208 violations by the federal Mine Safety and Health Administration that year. More than half those citations were labeled “serious and substantial,” like 20 roof falls, 14 wire insulation problems and three cases of inadequate ventilation plans.
Residents have returned to Cizre to find their homes destroyed by shelling. Authorities partially lifted a 24-hour curfew that had been imposed to facilitate security operations against Kurdish militants. A first wave of arrivals reached the town at the break of dawn, their vehicles loaded with personal belongings and, in many cases, children. In the battle-scarred Sur neighbourhood, homes have enormous holes blasted into their walls, ceilings have collapsed, windows are shattered and doors are hanging on their hinges.
The level of damage in some neighbourhoods evoked the early days of military conflict in neighbouring Syria with buildings gutted by shelling and shrapnel. "Those who did this are not humans," said Cizre resident Serif Ozem. "What took place here is a second Kobani in a country that is supposed to be a democracy." Kobani is a predominantly Kurdish town in northern Syria that suffered a brutal siege at the hands of the Islamic State (Isis) group.
Shell casings littered the streets of the Sur neighbourhood where residents made a grisly discovery — the corpse of an unidentifiable male. The stench of death also rose from the rubble of a collapsed building in the same area. Residents said the basement had been used a shelter and that it was demolished by the security forces.
The 24-hour curfew has been scaled down, although it will still hold between 7.30pm and 5am. The reprieve comes three weeks after authorities declared the successful conclusion of military operations to stamp out rebels linked to the Kurdistan Workers' Party, or PKK. The security forces declared victory over the Kurdish rebels on 11 February, but police said the curfew could not be lifted immediately because of the extent of explosives they had to clear.
PKK fighters had raised barricades, dug trenches and planted explosives to protect the area. The army says more than 600 Kurdish rebels were killed in Cizre.
Black Country funnyman Lenny Henry will make a welcome return to his native West Midlands to star in a new reggae-themed stage play.
The Dudley-born comedian and actor will star in the stage premiere of Rudy's Rare Records this September at Birmingham's Repertory Theatre, in what will be his first acting role at the venue.
Based on the successful BBC Radio 4 series, written by Danny Robins and which Henry co-created as well as starred in, the spin-off play is a comedy set in an old reggae record shop at risk of re-development in Birmingham. Henry plays Adam, the son of shop owner Rudy, who reluctantly moves home to look after his dad and help run the shop.
It will feature a live band on stage playing music by the likes of Jimmy Cliff, Desmond Dekker, Bob Marley and the Sugarhill Gang.
Rudy's Rare Records runs from September 4-20 and is one of the headline attractions of The Rep's autumn/winter season.
Lenny Henry is one of the West Midlands' best-loved entertainers, having made his name on New Faces and Tiswas, becoming a mainstay of TV comedy and one of the co-founders of Comic Relief. He has more recently re-established himself as an acclaimed stage actor, with previous roles including his portrayal of Shakespeare's Othello.
“I've performed comedy gigs many times in Birmingham over the years, but this is my first straight acting role in the city and the first time I've been on stage at The Rep, which is something I'm really looking forward to,” said Henry.
“Growing up in Dudley I would come into Birmingham every Saturday to hang out in a record shop not too dissimilar to Rudy's so it's a play that's very close to my heart.”
Tickets for The Rep's Autumn and Winter 2014 Season go on sale to members today (May 2) and to the general public on Friday, May 9. For more information and the full line-up visit www.birmingham-rep.co.uk.

After discovering that a few of his co-workers biked to work in the winter, Luke Van Santen was “overwhelmed” by the idea of pedaling through slush and snow. Then he started asking questions: Do you need superwarm clothing? Don't you have to worry about salt chewing up your bike? Is it safe?
This winter — his second commuting by bicycle — the 45-year-old is now the one fielding questions.
“It's kind of a low-level curiosity,” he said. “ ‘Oh, you ride your bike in the winter. Oh, you're kind of crazy, right?' ”
That kind of crazy is increasingly common. The number of people biking around Minneapolis and St. Paul rose 13 percent this year and 78 percent since 2007, according to a new count by Bike Walk Twin Cities, an advocacy group. Far fewer people ride during the winter, but over the past five years, cold-weather riding has increased at an even greater rate than in summer.
“More bicyclists are choosing to extend their season,” said Joan Pasiuk, director of Bike Walk Twin Cities, a program of the nonprofit Transit for Livable Communities. “People are understanding that winter bicycling can be safe, convenient, faster sometimes, and fun.”
The organization's annual count, conducted in September with the help of volunteers at 43 spots across the Twin Cities, jibes with the latest census data. About 11 percent of Minneapolis residents reported biking or walking to work in 2012 — an increase of 25 percent from 2011, according to the American Community Survey released in September. Minneapolis is No. 2 in the nation in bike commuting, per capita, after Portland, Ore., the survey found.
A cyclist took a bridge over Hiawatha Avenue in Minneapolis. “More bicyclists are choosing to extend their season,” said the director of Bike Walk Twin Cities.
The swell of people pedaling, even in the cold, reflects a dramatic expansion of bike trails and lanes that make biking safer and more accessible, the Bike Walk Twin Cities report argues. Counts done at locations with new facilities, including bike lanes, showed bigger bumps in bicycling traffic than those without.
An analysis of the Martin Olav Sabo Bridge and 28th Street crossing at Hiawatha Avenue indicates that rather than simply rerouting bikers, “the new bridge has helped encourage new users,” the report says.
Will Mackin, service coordinator at the Hub Bike Co-op, rides to work on Riverside Avenue, which was repaved as part of a reconstruction that added a bike lane.
“Almost immediately, we saw a big increase in ridership,” he said, plus a bump in business at the co-op's nearby store, one of three in Minneapolis. Years of rising ridership have driven a slight increase in sales at the co-op, despite a difficult recession, he said.
Winter riding equipment — including tires with metal studs and bright LED lights — has gotten cheaper in recent years, Mackin said, making it “more accessible to more people.”
Abbey Seitz, a senior at the University of Minnesota, took a city-planning course in Honolulu, where she expected that there would be “people biking everywhere.”
“Obviously, it's the perfect climate,” said Seitz, who is studying architecture. “But the roads and everything were not safe at all.”
Honolulu has worked in recent years to improve its biking infrastructure, Seitz said, but it's playing catch-up with other cities. It has about half the share of bike commuters as Minneapolis and ranks 12th in the census survey.
Studying in Honolulu dissuaded Seitz of the notion that biking participation was related to climate. “It was eye-opening,” she said. Here, people bike in winter because “the city is built for it.”
Van Santen, who uses the Cedar Lake Regional Trail and Midtown Greenway, likes “that added feeling of safety” that trails separated from traffic provide, especially in winter.
He also appreciates their quiet calm as it starts to snow. “It feels very much like a walk in the woods that everybody waxes poetic about.”
The walking half of the Bike Walk Twin Cities' new count showed a 6 percent decline in pedestrian traffic from 2012 to 2013. But such traffic has increased 16 percent since 2007, when the count began.
The report zeroed in on bridges, where all kinds of traffic converge. At six bridges, walkers and bikers made up 16 percent of traffic.
The report does not say whether that percentage has changed over time. That might be something the program studies in the future, she said, along with the gender of cyclists not just during the September count, but during winter months as well.
Funding for Bike Walk Twin Cities was done on a pilot basis. The program will wrap up some of its projects in 2014 and continue its monthly counts as it looks for new funding, Pasiuk said. Data around cars is “voluminous,” she said, while tracking bikers and walkers is “an emerging science.”
“It's important as we're making resource decisions to be able to demonstrate that there are road users who are not behind the wheel.”
Honey Nut Cheerios wants to be the cereal of choice for gamers. And Gawker Media's gaming-focused vertical Kotaku hopes to make that happen by producing its first sponsored series for the General Mills brand.
"They had expressed strong interest in reaching out to millennial gamers," Paul Sundue, executive director of Studio@Gawker, told Adweek.
He added that gaming content tends to focus on, as you might expect, playing games. But the new four-part series Compete takes viewers behind the screens. "We really think [telling stories about gamers] differentiates these videos," Sundue said.
Kotaku editor-in-chief Stephen Totilo said the response has been extremely positive. Since launching Sept. 10, the Compete videos have amassed more than 200,000 viewers on Kotaku's site alone, which counts some 12 million monthly visitors. "More arrangements like this will make more of this kind of work possible," Totilo said.
One episode includes a feature story on a world-class speed-gamer who overcomes a degenerative condition that has left him partially paralyzed. Another features a fighting game enthusiast who bests her opponents while blindfolded.
"I've been interested for a long time in telling the stories of the people who actually play video games," said Totilo. "I feel like that's been under-tapped."
The fourth and final episode, which premiered today, tells the story of "the "$6 million Echo Slam," an extraordinary play that enabled an American team of gamers to win the lucrative grand finals of the popular competitive multiplayer game Dota 2 in Seattle.
While this is Gawker Media's first time working with a brand on an editorial video series, it's not the last. Adequate Man, an offshoot blog of Gawker's Deadspin, is currently running a co-branded series with Gillette called You Got This!
According to a report by Egyoffline, posted in English by Eman Nabih (h/t BNI), Russia has released a classified U.S. document that details plans by the Obama administration to excite domestic insurrections in Egypt. The reason? To overthrow the government that overthrew the Muslim Brotherhood's Mohammed Mursi.
It is important to emphasize that while there are detailed descriptions of the “confidential report” and that much of it makes sense in the context of the Obama administration's actions in the Middle East, no link to the report has been provided nor has any information about how it was obtained. Please consider this as you read the translation of the Egyoffline piece (we have also made slight grammatical corrections to Nabih's translation). That said, another reason we decided to chime in on this story is that many of the data points presented by Egyoffline actually serve as the basis for our analysis at the end of this post. We think that, taken together, they may help to explain many of the inexplicable Obama administration policies.
Via Eman Nabih:
Recently, the Russians revealed a confidential U.S.Report about the USA's plan to get the Egyptian Military involved in a civil war and the necessity of overthrowing General Abd Elfatah Alsisi, the Egyptian Minister of Defense before he can become the new Nasser. The U.S. report revealed by the Russians started by saying that if Egyptians don't have a reason to kill each other, we must find them one… Our main goal is to push the Egyptian Military and the Egyptian People to fight each other before year 2015. If things remain the same as they are right now in Egypt, we will be facing a new Nasser in the Region. But this time Alsisi will be supported even by the oil-rich Gulf countries which was not the case of his predecessor. On the political and economic fronts, things won't be for the interests of the USA. {emphasis ours}
Again, based on the very Muslim Brotherhood-friendly stance the Obama administration has taken since the President's 2009 Cairo speech, throughout the Arab Spring, and since Mursi's removal, such a revelation would be shocking but believable. Questions that still need to be answered: How did the Russians acquire this report and why would the U.S. have something so incredibly damning in writing? To whom was it released? When was it produced? Who was responsible for compiling it? The CIA?
In citing this report, Egyoffline gives as good an explanation as any for why countries like Saudi Arabia are backing al-Sisi over a Muslim Brotherhood that it funds around the globe, to include inside the U.S. (Muslim World League):
The popularity that the Egyptian Military and General Alsisi are having now is not just in Egypt, but we are seeing also an increasing admiration Towards al-sisi from the Gulf countries and Tunis, which has already started to look for an al-Sisi counterpart… …Recently, People from the Gulf (states) showed their inclination to get involved in the confrontation which has not been their habit in the past. This is due to their fears of threats towards their thrones from the Muslim Brotherhood, which began targeting the Gulf countries after their Regime was overthrown in Egypt. {emphasis ours}
So, if the gulf states are supporting al-Sisi against the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt, why are they supporting the Muslim Brotherhood against Bashar al-Assad in Syria? The answer to that question is that the likes of Saudia Arabia fear Iran more than they do the Muslim Brotherhood.
We can conclude that if the classified report does exist, it was compiled after Mursi was removed from power on July 3rd, as Egyoffline seems to do:
This revealed report is under investigations by the US on how it got revealed by the Russians in the first place. There are suspicions that the Russians Intelligence is behind the spreading of this report. It also shows how successful active Russians Intelligence who appears in their new costume. This report revealed many things about what the US is planning and it is a strong slap to the American Security System to reveal such a report, especially that the report was revealed after a very short time from being issued and started to be in the executive form. Exposing this report by the Russians came at a very bad and critical time, as the U.S. is facing an obvious political failure on all levels. {emphasis ours}
Here is some potentially interesting detail:
The original report was issued in about 1736 pages which is a very accurate description study about the positions in the Gulf Countries and the Arab countries. There were approximately 1900 pages of documents that are considered to be the source of the most important research, studies and recommendations that was done according to field analyses supported in the above mentioned pages. These studies and research papers were prepared by Political institutions and universities and also by Military centers…etc The studies also contain many suggestions and proposed scenarios which are supposed to be enacted in stages and applied until the goal is achieved. This part of the report was supervised by four research units which included 120 strategic military and political experts. The majority of these strategic experts were Americans. {emphasis ours}
More key questions if this “confidential report” is to be given any credibility: Who were the political institutions, universities, and military centers involved? Who were the political experts who worked on the report?
One other paragraph from Nabih's translation piece:
…the study considered that as Iran is a strategic first degree enemy to the United States of America, Iranian Military can get in a direct confrontation with the Saudi Military. At the same time, street wars will be directed from Bahrain, Yemen, and the Eastern region.
We must stress that this report needs much more corroboration before it can be confirmed but when these scenarios are pieced together, much of what's happening in the Middle East – coupled with Obama administration policies – might be understood better by reading the Egyoffline account.
Throughout Obama's first term and into the first few months of his second, it could be argued that he was acting in concert with the Saudis. That all changed when Mursi was overthrown. It's obvious that the Obama administration chose the Muslim Brotherhood while the Saudis chose al-Sisi. In Syria, Obama has been siding with the Muslim Brotherhood rebels, as have the Saudis, though presumably for disparate reasons. The Saudis see Iran as a greater threat than the Brotherhood, which they prefer to keep at arms length, as seen by their decision to back al-Sisi in Egypt.
There was arguably a much wider schism created between the Saudis and the Obama administration when the latter didn't attack Assad.
Now with news that Obama has been working to lift sanctions on Iran for months, it's been difficult to understand the endgame. For the purposes of this analysis, consider three factions in the Middle East – Iranian Shi'ites (Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, Hezbollah, etc.); Gulf States (Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Qatar, etc.); and the Muslim Brotherhood (seeks dissolution of national borders and a return to the Ottoman Empire in Turkey, which is also supported by Turkish Prime Minister Erdoğan).
Instead of helping the gulf states by attacking Assad, the Obama administration appears to be helping Iran. It doesn't make sense – unless the objective is to sic Iran and Saudi Arabia on each other. Does this not weaken Assad in Syria? Does it not weaken Saudi Arabia? Does it not weaken Iran?
By process of elimination, who does that help?
The Muslim Brotherhood – the same Muslim Brotherhood the Obama administration allegedly wants back in power in Egypt. The following excerpt from the U.S. Declaration of Independence was written about Great Britain's King George III:
He has excited domestic insurrections amongst us, and has endeavoured to bring on the inhabitants of our frontiers, the merciless Indian Savages, whose known rule of warfare, is an undistinguished destruction of all ages, sexes and conditions. – U.S. Declaration of Independence
With one minor tweak, Egyptians may be able to apply that to Barack Obama:
He has excited domestic insurrections amongst us, and has endeavoured to bring on the inhabitants of our frontiers, the merciless Indian Brotherhood Savages, whose known rule of warfare, is an undistinguished destruction of all ages, sexes and conditions.
For added irony, Mursi was removed from power one day before July 4th.
**UPDATE at 5:35am EST on November 15, 2013**
Not sure how we missed including this in the original post but consider what Anne Patterson – the U.S. Ambassador to Egypt at the time of Mursi's removal – reportedly warned al-Sisi of a civil war if Muslim Brotherhood members jailed were not released.
Via Gatestone:
Last week, for example, El Fagr reported that, during their most recent phone conversation, Patterson demanded that Egypt's recently appointed Supreme Commander of the Egyptian Armed Forces, General Abdul Fatah al-Sisi, release all Muslim Brotherhood members currently being held for questioning: “And when Sisi rejected this order, the American ambassador began threatening him that Egypt will turn into another Syria and live through a civil war, to which Sisi responded violently: ‘Neither you nor your country can overcome Egypt and its people.'” {emphasis ours}
Since then, Patterson has left her position as ambassador and is up for a promotion as Barack Obama's choice for Assistant Secretary of State for Near Eastern Affairs. She is one of two nominees Senator Lindsey Graham is not putting a hold on until he gets access to Benghazi witnesses. It would seem that a hold should be placed on Patterson indefinitely, regardless of what Benghazi witnesses are allowed to come forward.

After years of planning at a cost exceeding $400,000, Pittsburgh officials say they are implementing a program to ease nighttime congestion and bad behavior in the South Side business district.
But longtime South Side merchants, who were supposed to benefit from the Sociable City concept championed by Councilman Bruce Kraus, say it has backfired at their expense.
They said parking restrictions have driven away customers, and they fear Kraus-sponsored legislation for further restrictions will add to accumulating storefront vacancies on Carson Street. They note that South Side crime statistics have increased despite additional police scrutiny since 2012 when the city hired Santa Cruz, Calif.-based Responsible Hospitality Institute as a consultant to develop plans for reducing crime.
Most of all, they complain that the city has failed to communicate details of plan implementation and has turned a deaf ear to their worries.
“(Kraus) has created a process for input to be given, but it's being ignored,” said Michael Murphy, owner of the Carson Street Deli and Craft Beer Bar. “While the business group has had an opportunity to be heard very selectively, it's not being heard.”
Kraus, who lives in the South Side and represents the neighborhood, said he's met with residents and businesses individually since 2014 and convened five public meetings and a workshop to gather input and give residents and business owners status reports about the Sociable City plan.
He said the South Side has suffered for years from drunken revelry, including vandalism, assaults, public urination and worse, and the neighborhood had to change.
“Anyone who wanted to be a part of constructive change has participated,” Kraus said. “They're correct if they're saying I won't listen to let's do business as usual. Status quo gave us what I own. There clearly needs to be change, and I put together some sound policy to effectuate that change.”
The city spent $300,000 for the Responsible Hospitality Plan at Kraus' urging and budgeted a total $137,000 in 2015 and 2016 on salaries for a nighttime economy manager.
In addition, the city is spending thousands each weekend on overtime for police officers to patrol the South Side. The police bureau could not provide a total cost of overtime for so-called saturation patrols.
While vandalism, drunken driving and serious crime, including homicide, burglary, rape and aggravated assault, have decreased by double-digit percentages, overall crime has increased by 37 percent since 2012, according to annual statistics published by the police bureau. Meanwhile, public drunkenness arrests are up by nearly 800 percent along with disorderly conduct arrests, which increased by 140 percent.
Public Safety spokeswoman Sonya Toler attributed the increase to a heightened police presence. She said it contributed to a decrease in violent crime.
“I can tell you that when you have increased enforcement, you're going to have increased numbers,” Toler said. “There's an increased presence of uniformed police officers, and that speaks volumes to would-be criminals. That decreases the chances of someone being shot or stabbed.”
Business owners applaud increased police patrols, but said they have seen little else to benefit business.
John DeMauro, president of the South Side Bar and Restaurant Association, said the city has implemented parts of the plan, including police patrols and initiatives to ease traffic congestion.
“It's only hitting on some of the points, and businesses would argue that it's not dealing with the business interests adequately,” said DeMauro, who lives in the South Side and owns Jimmy D's and the Urban Tap, both on Carson Street. “It's like a recipe for something with only a couple ingredients.”
Jonathan Growall, president of the South Side Chamber of Commerce, said Kraus has concentrated on lobbying for more police protection rather than addressing requests for a paid staff, such as a main street manager, to implement the plan fully.
He said revenue from increased parking enforcement should be used to hire staff.
“What we don't have is paid people in the street to get it done,” he said. “That's what I'm asking from Bruce right now. Everybody is just completely confused about what he's trying to do.”
Kraus said he's always responded to community requests and asked for documentation to prove he has ignored constituents.
“Share with me phone calls, request for meetings, emails that went unanswered,” he said. “I will entertain that conversation.”
Allison Harnden, Pittsburgh's nighttime economy manager, said the neighborhood will begin to see changes this year. Last week, she said, city police began implementation of a “transportation zone” at 17th Street and Carson where visitors can grab a cab and access valet parking and park-and-ride services. A shuttle to a large city parking lot on Second Avenue, Uptown, is coming along with increased parking enforcement through midnight. The extra revenue from parking and enforcement will pay for the extra police, she said.
Business owners object to increased enforcement and the Second Avenue shuttle, saying they will further restrict access to South Side.
Harnden said the city is open to change as plans progress.
“I hear through the grapevine a few naysayers who say … things aren't working, but I don't understand how they can say that,” she said. “(The plan is) being implemented right now.”
Tim McNulty, spokesman for Mayor Bill Peduto, said the mayor's office believes spending $300,000 is a small price to pay.
“Going forward, we think it's going to be a great benefit to businesses, residents and communities all over the city.”

Sphero's BB-8 will undoubtedly be one of the most sought-after toys heading into the holidays, but it turns out it's not the only company who's figured out how to bring BB-8 to life. This larger version of the droid isn't remote control, but it can still roll, talk, and interact with kids through simple voice commands.
Popping up on the UK version of the Disney Store (it's already midnight on September 4 there) Thinkway Toys' version of BB-8 is considerably larger than Sphero's, standing just shy of 12-inches tall to the tip of its antenna. It also appears to be even more detailed with a spherical body actually made of various plastic segments. Toss a bit more sand and grime on there and it could easily pass for the actual movie prop.

Powered by four AA batteries, this BB-8's head can turn and its body can roll and spin in any direction. It also lights up, has 20 built-in sound effects (Sphero's version relies on the app for all of its sounds) and comes with two different play modes. One sends it rolling around the room, while the other puts it into a listening mode awaiting voice commands. It doesn't work with a smartphone or tablet, but how long can kids really spend poking a touchscreen?
Thinkway Toys' BB-8 will apparently be sold exclusively at Disney Stores, and at £29.95, or about $45 is US dollars, it's considerably cheaper than Sphero's version. So if your kids are clambering for a fancy interactive BB-8, but you'd rather not put $150 worth of toy in their hands, you might want to check out your local Disney Store tomorrow morning before these things sell out.

It took more than a century for the Boy Scouts of America (BSA) to openly admit homosexuals as scouts, although they are still not permitted as troop leaders. There is another way in which the organisation should be opposed: it threatens the extinction of pedicularis dudleyi, otherwise known as Dudley's lousewort, a fern-like plant so-named because it was once believed to cause lice infestation in livestock.
Kim Kuska is a one-time biology teacher whose membership of the BSA spanned more than half a century. When he applied to renew his membership in 2012, he was declined sans explanation – he was expelled.
Kuska's offence was to be obsessed with preventing the demise of Dudley's lousewort at the Camp Pico Blanco Scout camp that is situated in the Los Padres National Forest by the Little Sur River, south of Monterey, California and was established in 1953. Kuska was the camp's nature director. Around the camp are found almost half the known specimens of the plant, with the remainder at two other locations in California.
Ron Schoenmehl, the director of support services for the BSA's Silicon Valley Monterey Bay Council, later accused Kuska of planting lousewort seeds in places where it didn't already grow, some of which were high-traffic areas, which would mean that these locations would have to be protected.
Scouts have often endangered the existence of Dudley's lousewort by harvesting the old-growth trees it requires. Some of the trees would have been in excess of 200 years old. State law prohibits damage to rare plants, which a Scout official admitted had occurred and which is being investigated by the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection. Scout culpability is evident from photographs posted to one Scout's Facebook page which showed wood cuttings atop louseworts.
Kuska recorded all the misdeeds he observed in the course of 30 years. Before he was expelled, he planted an orange flag by a lousewort close to a dining hall, which didn't prevent someone from rolling a wheelbarrow over the plant. Kuska then surrounded the plant with fist-sized rocks, which somebody moved onto the plant. This was, he said, “an unbelievably hostile move.” He added, “Someone needs to be protecting this plant. Somebody's going to have to defend it.”
The Scouts' environmental malefactions don't end with Dudley's lousewort. In 2009, it was reported that a dam erected by Scouts at Camp Pico Blanco killed at least 30 steelhead trout, which are federally-protected.
Schumacher, the son of seven-time world champion Michael, is stepping up to the European Formula 3 Championship this season with Prema.
Mercedes has already been linked with a potential move to sign up the 17-year-old to its young driver programme, and now Ferrari has said it too would like to have him as part of its Ferrari Driver Academy (FDA).
Massimo Rivola, the FDA manager, told Gazzetta dello Sport about Schumacher: "Obviously we follow him.
"And this year we will have the opportunity to stay very close to Mick, because he will be teammate of our FDA driver (Guan Yu) Zhou in the Prema team.
"About his future, I don't know what Mick will decide to do. But if he would like to enter the FDA programme, he will find a red carpet."
Rivola added that it was not just Schumacher's form on track that impressed him, but also the way he handled himself outside of a car too.
"Mick seems very polite and he's not full of himself - so congratulations to his parents. They did a very good job with him.
"He's very young, and he must manage a very huge media pressure. But he is doing it very well."
Giovinazzi and F1
Rivola has also heaped praise on Ferrari third driver Antonio Giovinazzi, who was signed up after an impressive rookie campaign in GP2 where he won five races and finished runner-up to Pierre Gasly.
"He's very strong," explained Rivola. "I wanted him in the Academy already at the beginning of 2016, so I'm very happy that he's now Ferrari's third driver. He deserves this chance.
"For me, he is a great talent and his attitude is impressive. It is true that Antonio is 23, but I don't think it is correct that F1's door is open only to 18-year-old drivers.
"Every driver has a personal story, and that is what F1 must look at."
We have the tools to prevent further destruction of ancient Assyrian history and we need to use them now
(Image: Steven Vidler/Corbis)
YOU don't have to be a historian or an archaeologist to feel anger and despair at the destruction of Nimrud, ancient capital of Assyria, by the self-styled Islamic State. UNESCO director-general Irina Bokova has described it as a “war crime”. It feels like a crime against humanity.
As so often with ISIS, it is an act seemingly designed to show that the militants are unconstrained by the bounds most humanity observes. Who would not respect such a unique location, or the irreplaceable artefacts destroyed at the Mosul Museum in Iraq?
But in fact ISIS, for all its ostentatious extremism, is just the latest in a long line of vandals. Egregious examples in the past century include the Nazi book burnings of the 1930s and the Taliban's shelling of the Buddhas of Bamiyan, Afghanistan, in 2001 – spared even by Genghis Khan.

Destroying stores of knowledge is a tactic favoured by those who seek to press home a fundamentalist message. “Those who don't know history are destined to repeat it,” said the 18th-century philosopher Edmund Burke. For those who want to create their own fundamentalist pastiche of the past, obliterating the lessons of history is an attractive idea.
What can be done? It is too late for Nimrud (see “Can we save history from ISIS vandals?“). But we can do more to protect antiquities in future. There is a strong suspicion that ISIS, which like so many despotic regimes is not as ideologically pure as it pretends, is profiting from the sale of looted art and artefacts. Last month, the UN Security Council passed a resolution obliging all member states to improve their capacity to seize looted antiquities from ISIS-controlled territory. The UK, for its part, could finally ratify the 1954 Hague Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict – more than a decade after it agreed to do so.
Technology can help, too. It's no substitute for physically securing a site, but remote sensing technologies can at least record sites at risk of destruction. For example, drone-mounted rigs makes 3D scanning of sites relatively cheap and easy.
Such scans might even make rebuilding easier. Attempts to reconstruct the Bamiyan Buddhas have stalled partly because no one can agree on how to go about it. Today, more than ever before, we have the tools to ensure history cannot be effaced altogether or forever. We should vow to use them, before Nimrud's destruction itself passes into forgotten history.

The Roman Catholic Diocese of Pittsburgh must focus on “better homilies, better music and more people” as its six-county territory attempts to reverse a series of “sobering” trends and prepares for a major overhaul in 2018, Bishop David Zubik said Wednesday.
“The No. 1 priority has to be, ‘We need to make our worship better,'” Zubik told the Tribune-Review. “Second of all, we need to do the best job that we can to get not only more ordained leaders, but we really have to open up lots of doors for the lay leaders of the church.”
The Pittsburgh diocese is closing in on the parishioner-input phase of a comprehensive planning initiative called “On Mission for the Church Alive!,” through which leaders are examining how to strengthen church participation, reorganize aging infrastructure and make the most of dwindling resources.
They're up against dismal data.
The number of active Catholics within the Pittsburgh diocese has declined rapidly in recent decades, from 914,000 in 1980 to 632,000 in 2015, diocesan figures show.
Since 2000, weekly Mass attendance has dropped by 40 percent — for almost 100,000 fewer regular churchgoers; K-8 Catholic school enrollment fell by 50 percent; and the number of active priests plummeted from 338 to 225.
By 2025, if trends hold, the diocese projects that just 112 active priests will remain.
“I hear that the laity is going to have to take that torch and do some of what the priests were doing, and my concern is our laity is not really trained well enough to do that in time,” said St. Andrew's parishioner John Cascino, 53, a father of six young children in Butler. “It's going to be a while before all these new deacon classes get taught.”
Empty pews correlate with dwindling coffers: About half of almost 200 parishes lost money in 2015, compared with one-third of parishes operating in the red in 2012, Zubik said.
Critics of a massive reorganization — such as small groups of parishioners who've fought recent closures of cash-strapped churches — worry that too much emphasis will be placed on consolidation breaking up longtime faith communities.
“There will be some who people who say, ‘This is all about closing churches,' or people will be cynical and say, ‘Why the heck is he asking us to get involved in these discussions because he's already made up his mind?'” Zubik acknowledged.
“The answer is that's not at all what it's about, and I haven't made the decisions,” Zubik continued. “I need to hear from people.”
Over the summer, Zubik led four of 18 informational events on the initiative, with about 4,500 people attending. Between Oct. 10 and Dec. 1, each of 195 parishes is set to host two “consultation sessions” so members can learn about proposed organizational models and provide feedback.
“The statistics were very sobering,” Zubik said of how parishioners reacted to the summer sessions, “but at the same time, I found they were very excited about the important aspect of why we're doing this: to enliven people's faith.”
Among topics under discussion: growing the pools of highly trained lay leaders and deacons; getting churches to be more hospitable to outsiders; mapping out financial viability 20 years from now; and appealing to youths through new types of ministry while simultaneously strengthening pastoral care for the elderly.
The final set of recommendations — which Zubik plans to unveil in early 2018 — will be the culmination of three years of input from parishioners, clergy and lay leaders, as curated and analyzed by the “On Mission” commission, which comprises more than 80 members appointed by pastors across the region.
“We have to be creative in forging new ways to engage young people, and people who have felt they are not welcome in our church or who have chosen a different path,” said Kathy Buechel, chairwoman of the “On Mission” commission, as well as a University of Pittsburgh philanthropy professor and a member of St. Paul's in Oakland. “We're thinking of this as an opportunity to reawaken the spirit of the Church.”
The 78 parishes of the Catholic Diocese of Greensburg — with 142,000 members across four counties — appear to be in better fiscal shape. Greensburg diocese spokesman Jerry Zufelt said that no parishes appear to be in “dire financial straits.” That stability follows two reorganizations in the past seven years, resulting in 16 parish closures and mergers involving eight parishes.
In designing the “On Mission” initiative, Zubik said he drew from elements of the Archdiocese of Boston's long-term planning efforts.
Boston's “Disciples in Mission” plan involves creating “collaboratives” of one to three parishes overseen by a pastor and team of priests, deacons and lay staff, with each parish maintaining its own finances and identity, Boston Archdiocese spokesman Terrence Donilon said.
The Pittsburgh diocese includes Allegheny, Beaver, Butler, Lawrence, Greene and Washington counties — a 3,750-square-mile area made up of 632,000 Catholics, or one-third of the zone's total population.
It last embarked on a major reorganization in 1989, and shrank from 310 parishes using 333 buildings to 218 parishes using 288 buildings by 1998.
In 2016, at least 37 diocesan priests split their time among more than one parish, noted Zubik, with some overseeing three to four.
More consolidation “needs to happen so that they're not driving from church to church and trying to serve so many parishes,” Cascino said. “It's going to be hard, and people are not going to want to give up their family church. But it's a reality, and the upside of it is that we could have larger churches filled with more people — that in itself creates a sense of vibrancy.”

Masked muscle men get into their trunks to storm the beach and demand freedom for an anti-gay activist
The world's most homoerotic anti-gay marriage protestors are at it again – getting down to their trunks to invade France and ‘liberate' a fellow activist.
The young, masked, muscled men – Les Hommen – are at war with France's decision to legalize same-sex marriage.
And in a shambolic recreation of the D-Day landings, they storm their way onto the beach.
It's lucky that, unlike the country's true liberators in 1944, there are no machine gun emplacements firing at them. Because that would surely puncture their landing craft – an inflatable canoe.
And this time the ‘liberation' doesn't take place on the heavily fortified beaches of Normandy but on the holiday sands of Montpellier, on France's Mediterranean coast.
A video uploaded on YouTube shows Les Hommen fighting their way through the waves only to find… absolutely no resistance.
Undeterred, they hold up a sign demanding France should ‘Free Nicolas'.
The 23-year-old they are referring to, whose last name has not been reported, is in jail after taking part in a protest against same-sex marriage equality on 16 June.
He was arrested for picketing television channel M6 studios where President François Hollande was being interviewed.
Police say he resisted arrest, refused to give a DNA sample and was a security risk.
On 20 June he was sentenced to four months in jail and given a fine of €1,000 ($1,300) by a Paris court.
Les Hommen, inspired by the topless feminist group Femen but with very different politics, spiced up the anti-LGBT marriage protests in France with their shirtless protests earlier this year.
Despite the law being passed, they are continuing the fight and Nicolas is their latest cause.
A group of them were also at the Tour de France bike race on Sunday (7 July) in the Pyrenees, running alongside the leading riders on a climb.
A Twitter report says: ‘They had on masks, and were shirtless with “Democracy is Dead” written on their torsos. They did not disrupt the riders except that they were noisy and obnoxious like the rest of the millions of people on the mountain.'
France passed the same-sex marriage in May and the first ceremony was in Montpellier, a cosmopolitan city with a small gay scene and large student population.

Prepare to see Patrick Stewart as you've never seen him before.
Starz on Friday released a first-look trailer for its upcoming Stewart-fronted comedy series Blunt Talk.
The half-hour scripted comedy was created by Bored to Death's Jonathan Ames and counts Seth MacFarlane as an executive producer. The show, which was picked up straight to series for two seasons and 20 episodes, revolves around Walter Blunt (Stewart), a British transplant intent on conquering the world of American cable news. The series follows the fallout from Blunt's well-intentioned, but mostly misguided decision-making, both on and off the air.

Watch the first trailer below. Blunt Talk premieres this summer on Starz. An exact premiere date has not yet been determined.
Earlier today we discussed Neel Kashkari's weight problem (he's determined to lose the 20 pounds he gained while working for the Treasury). We thought it seemed a bit extreme that he would, by his own admission, skip dinner many nights in order to reach his target, but now it's all become clear. He's on a deadline to look good in a bathing suit, having taken a gig with PIMCO in Newport Beach. Here's the full letter from Bill Gross and and Mohamed El-Erian to clients (courtesty of a Dealbreaker Commenter):
Throughout this process, our objective has remained the preservation and enrichment of the investment and retirement assets that you have entrusted to PIMCO. We plan to continue the focus and determination that you have come to expect from our firm for almost forty years.
Perhaps less visible to you is the effort that we have made to ensure that our institutional platform and approaches are positioned to serve you in the best and most sustainable manner possible. We recognize that the implications of the new normal for the investment management industry go well beyond adapting investment strategies. There are important consequences for other parts of what makes PIMCO effective in meeting your needs. Specifically, today's ongoing global transformations are impacting the design of investment products, the manner in which we interact with our clients, and the way we run our business. And all this influences the scope and organization of our human and technical resources.
We have already taken a series of steps to further enhance our client servicing, to expand and adapt our product line, and to strengthen our business platform. Having emerged from the global financial crisis stronger-in both absolute and relative terms-PIMCO has been able to deepen its capabilities by adding top talent, as well as increase spending on technology and analytics.
Today we will publicly announce another important step that is part of our efforts to ensure that the firm continues to evolve and meet your investment needs in the future. Specifically-and after a multiyear process of internal assessment, consultation with outside experts, and interviews of many teams-PIMCO will announce the hiring of a highly experienced and successful equity team.
Anne Gudefin and Chuck Lahr are joining us as global equity portfolio managers. They come to us after a highly successful tenure at the Mutual Series of Franklin Templeton where they were the co-portfolio managers for the Franklin Mutual Global Discovery Fund. Anne will begin in early Jan. 2010, and she will be based in our London office. Chuck begins today and he will be based in our New York office.
Why is PIMCO expanding into active equity management at this time? For three main reasons:
• First, and foremost, because we recognize that your needs, as our clients, are also evolving. We have heard you emphasize investment solutions as well as products; and we have already worked closely with several of you in designing multi-asset class approaches that are supplemented by appropriate and cost-effective risk management.
• Second, we believe that PIMCO's time tested investment process can, and will, strongly supplement bottom-up equity management expertise, especially at a time of great fluidity in the global economy and in the capital structures of companies.
• Third, in Anne and Chuck, we have found great experienced complements to the PIMCO investment philosophy and process.
Our firm has continuously evolved throughout our history, drawing strength from a proven investment process and the depth and breadth of our resources. PIMCO's entry into active equity management is another example of this evolution. And consistent with what has served our clients well in the past, this evolution will be measured and disciplined. And, critically, it is aimed at providing you with the best investment management services in the world.
In addition to hiring a top equity team, we have also recognized the need for an experienced person to work closely with PIMCO's Executive Committee to lead our entry into this and other new businesses over time. Accordingly, Neel Kashkari is joining us on December 14 to lead new investment initiatives. Neel will be based in our Newport Beach office.
Many of you may know of Neel from his previous responsibilities at the US Treasury where, until May 2009, he served as Assistant Secretary. Neel quickly established himself as a "go-to" person during the global crisis. We are confident that his skill set will be of direct long-term benefit to our clients-mainly in the positive sense of bringing more talent to PIMCO but also in ensuring that we do not inappropriately divert the focus of other colleagues devoted to what we already deliver to you.
All these steps are part of PIMCO's evolution over the last decade that has already taken us beyond being solely focused on core fixed income. By adding active equities to the range of solutions PIMCO provides, our primary aim remains the same as it as been throughout PIMCO's history: to serve as a trusted advisor to our clients around the world. Importantly, this has not, nor will it distract or detract us from our ongoing management of our fixed income products. It's an evolutionary process-not a revolutionary event-that has been driven by the needs of our clients, the entrepreneurship of our colleagues, and the robustness of our investment process and platform.
In closing, please allow us to wish you the very best for the holiday seasons and the New Year. Thank you again for your trust in PIMCO. We are fully committed to continuing to deliver to you the best investment management services.
With our best regards
Bill Gross

When Lil Wayne released the preview to “Dusse” earlier this year, many wondered why he referenced Jay-Z on the song.
“Hov is the god,” Lil Wayne says in an interview with MTV. “I'll give Hov a big shout out at all times.”
Lil Wayne says the Jay Z-endorsed drink played a part in the making of the track.
“We are just on that D'usse heavy,” Wayne says. “I don't write none of my music. I don't write it down, so I just go in there and say whatever come to my mind…So what came to my mind that night, was what was on my mind that night.”
“Hov, fuck wit' your boy,” Wayne says on the track.
Wayne's reference to Jay-Z follows a rumored feud between the two emcees. In February 2012, Lil Wayne appeared to rap about Jay-Z and Kanye West's Watch The Throne. “I met a bad red bone, I took the bitch home,” Wayne rapped during a show. “I asked her what she wants to watch, she said surely not The Throne.”
He reportedly was upset with a Jay-Z line off Watch The Throne's “H.A.M.” “I'm like, ‘Really, half-a-billi?' / Nigga, really, you got baby money / Keep it real with niggas, niggas ain't got my lady money,” lines that some believed were a shot towards Cash Money's head, Baby.
Wayne also appeared to respond to this on “I'm Good” off Tha Carter IV. “I got your baby money,” Wayne raps on the track. “Kidnap your bitch, get that ‘how much you love your lady' money.”
In June 2013, Jay-Z appeared to address Lil Wayne on Magna Carta…Holy Grail's “La Familia.” “Wanna kidnap wifey,” Jay raps on the song. “Good luck with that bruh / You must gonna hide your whole family / What you think we're wearing black for / Ready for that war / Ready for that war ready / You ain't ready, yo, you radio.”
In July 2013, Jay-Z addressed a botched Roc-A-Fella deal with Lil Wayne. “This is the first time I ever told this truth,” Jay-Z revealed. “The truth is after I had a meeting with Wayne—I had a relationship with Baby, when I used to go to New Orleans I would meet up with him…So, I felt it was only right to call him. I called him out of respect like, ‘Yo, I was talking to Wayne. Just to let you know. Boom boom boom.' So, after that I think we received a letter at our office for like torturous interference from a lawyer…And it all just went from there. I would rather lose that situation and do the right thing than the opposite. Because I think I could have signed him. I could have signed him and then told him after. I did the right thing and I'm cool with that decision.”
In March 2014, Wayne addressed his appreciation for Jay-Z. “I loved Jay so much,” he said at the time. “And then at that time I was super young and I was still—I was a fanatic of Jay-Z…So, when he said he was retiring, I looked—I was like a basketball player looking up at Kobe or looking up at Jordan…LeBron. Somebody gotta step up. And you know, I felt like you said, I felt like nobody cared about what I said, so when you're that person then what you say means the world to you.”
During that interview, Wayne also spoke about the botched Roc deal. “It wasn't like Jay was reaching out for me or nothing,” Lil Wayne said. “Like needed me, ‘I need—I want you over here.' He expressed interest. And I took that and you know me…I was on the first thing smoking. So, I went over there and we met. I met with Jay. But the history turned out to be where history is.”

A leaked draft copy of a rule from the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), if implemented by the Trump administration, would ensure employers who object to providing contraception, abortion-inducing drugs, and sterilization procedures through health insurance plans are able to maintain the freedom to follow their beliefs.
Such a rule would protect groups such as the Little Sisters of the Poor and other religious charities from the contraception mandate that was inserted into Obamacare by former HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius and bureaucrats in her department.
Planned Parenthood president Cecile Richards has touted the fact that, with Obamacare and the HHS mandate, 55 million women in the United States are receiving free birth control.
The new regulation is reportedly under review by the Trump HHS, under the direction of Secretary Tom Price. While the rule would exempt religious groups from having to provide services and drugs that are in conflict with their religious beliefs, it would still leave in place the Obama administration's “accommodation” for any group that wishes to use it.
Becket Law – which represents the Little Sisters of the Poor – notes that the new rule would fulfill the Supreme Court's ruling last year as well as President Donald Trump's promise earlier in May.
In May of 2016, the Supreme Court unanimously decided to send back to the lower courts the case of the Little Sisters, in effect ordering the government not to fine the Sisters for noncompliance with the HHS mandate and for not informing the government that the mandate is in conflict with their beliefs.
In early May, Trump invited the Little Sisters on stage with him at the National Day of Prayer event at the White House.
“I want you to know that your long ordeal will soon be over,” Trump promised the Sisters.
The Obama administration demonstrated marked inconsistency with regard to exemptions from the HHS mandate. While it fiercely fought against an exemption for religious charities such as the Little Sisters, the former administration exempted health insurance plans for big corporations – such as Chevron, Exxon, Visa, and Pepsi Bottling – from the mandate.
Similarly, New York City, and other large cities were given exemptions from the HHS mandate, as was the U.S. military.
“At long last the United States government acknowledges that people can get contraceptives without forcing nuns to provide them,” said Mark Rienzi, senior counsel with Becket. “That is sensible, fair, and in keeping with the Supreme Court's order and the President's promise to the Little Sisters and other religious groups serving the poor.”
“As many Americans of faith have experienced, the extent of the Obama administration's hostility toward their beliefs was astounding,” Family Research Council president Tony Perkins said in a statement about the leaked draft.
He added:
From President Obama's dismissal of people of faith as Americans “clinging” to their religion, to threatening millions in crushing fines against charities like the Little Sisters of the Poor, the Obama administration made clear they believed people of faith had no place in the public square and that religious beliefs or moral convictions were irrelevant to the health care they provide.
Similarly, Jeanne Mancini, president of March for Life, said the leaked draft of the new HHS rule “signals hope for the full reinstatement of our right to conscience protection.”
“Having gone to court over this issue ourselves, the March for Life knows firsthand how oppressive the Obama-era mandate is, forcing groups like ours and religious orders like Little Sisters of the Poor to cover conscience-violating drugs,” Mancini continued. “We thank both HHS Secretary Tom Price and President Donald Trump for continuing to prioritize the protection of conscience for every American, and look forward to this administration fulfilling one if its most central and integral promises.”

Over 5,000 migrants have been sent back from Austria to the first EU country they entered and more will be returned in the future, says Austria's Interior Minister.
Speaking to journalists at a meeting in Germany with the Bavarian Christian Social Union party, Interior Minister Johanna Mikl-Leitner said: “If I remember rightly, we have sent more than 5,000 or 5,500 back from Austria, especially to Bulgaria and Romania amongst others.”
She added that people who apply for asylum in Austria after travelling through Croatia and Slovenia will be returned to these countries, as according to the Dublin Regulation they must apply for asylum in the first EU country they reached.
“If refugees come from Slovenia and Croatia to Austria and apply for asylum in Austria ... then we'll take them back to Croatia and Slovenia,” she said, pointing out that hardly any asylum applications had been lodge in these countries.
Arguing that a functioning asylum system needs an effective return policy, Mikl-Leitner added that “there's still a lot of work to do on this, especially with regard to north African countries”.
She added that 545 people smugglers have been jailed in Austria and the country expects about 2,000 trials of traffickers this year.
Chaotic scenes in Salzburg
The news comes amid chaotic scenes at Salzburg train station with the temporary accommodation designed for 800 people frequently over capacity as thousands of asylum seekers arrive with the hope of travelling onto nearby Germany.
On Wednesday over 2000 migrants arrived, with Salzburg Mayor Heinz Schaden warning on Thursday of an emergency situation that is permanently overwhelming the station.
“Under the circumstances we cannot cope for much longer with Salzburg functioning as a transit point from Austria to Germany,” he said.

For the first time in Premier League history, Watford have stayed up for consecutive seasons. 2015-16 was their first top flight campaign since 2006-07 when they were relegated after finishing at the bottom of the league. They managed a mid table finish, ending up in 13th place under Quique Sánchez Flores. They also made an appearance at Wembley in the FA Cup semi-final after knocking off two-time holders, Arsenal.
Their follow-up season was anything but enjoyable. In the end, they achieved their goal of staying up, but they did not do so with confidence. It was a 17th place finish for Walter Mazzarri's men which saw him get sacked at the end of the season.
Now in their third consecutive Premier League season, they are under their third different manager. It seems that the club has finally found the right fit. Marco Silva chose to take the vacant manager position at Vicarage Road after leaving relegated Hull City.
Although Silva could not keep Hull up, he guided them to six wins in 18 matches. This is after they only managed three wins under Mike Phelan in the previous 20 games. Had he not been brought in, Hull's relegation would have been confirmed long before May 14th. Watford surprisingly won the race for Silva who wanted to continue the challenge of managing in the Premier League.
Through five games, Watford sits in 11th place on eight points. While they were outclassed by Manchester City, Watford has gotten off to a great start to the season and will be looking to keep it going.
But how did he get Watford to this point so far?
They did fantastic business in the transfer window and more players are contributing to their success. They have scored seven goals and allowed nine, with all goals conceded coming in two games (can we just write off the city match?).
They have had six different players score their seven goals as well. Abdoulaye Doucouré and new signing Nathaniel Chalobah have been exceptional in the midfield. Doucouré has been the playmaker that they have lacked going forward from the midfield in the past few years while Chalobah does the dirty work. They are a dream midfield pivot for Silva. With Etienne Capoue also available, there will be plenty of pressure on all midfielders to keep up the good performances with the fear of being dropped.
Their attack has also been given a new dimension with new signing Richarlison. He is a player who loves to dribble and cut inside from the wing. He has already gotten a "Man of the Match" award for his performance against Bournemouth, scoring the winning goal in the 73rd minute.
Silva has also gone about making Vicarage Road a tough place to play for the opposition. In his career, Silva has been an excellent manager in home matches which will be key for Watford to accomplish a record finish this year.
It is all starting to come together for Watford thanks to Silva's great business in the summer. While we can't expect them to challenge at the top for a Champions League spot, they may end up being in the Europa League discussion which would be fantastic for the club. I would argue that Silva will finally get the shot to manage the club for more than one season, which has not happened since Gianfranco Zola managed the club for 66 games from July 2012 to December 2013. The club lacks stability, but it finally may be here.
Today marks the 33rd anniversary of the birth of the incredibly talented geek and latter-day geek icon known as Felicia Day. Day first became known to the geek community for her recurring role as Vi in the final season of Buffy the Vampire Slayer, and since then has beamed up to geek stardom via her role as Penny in Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog, the recently resurrected Dr. Holly Martin on Eureka and, especially, for her truly awesome web series The Guild.

All of us at GeekDad are huge Felicia Day fans, and wish her the very happiest of birthdays! We also feel that, as geeks, it behooves us to mention that Day's first name means "happiness," so that means her name is two-thirds of the phrase "happy birthday." Sort of.
Please join us in wishing Ms. Day a happy, geeky birthday, and many more! Leave birthday greetings in a comment if you're so inclined. And if you are yet untouched by The Guild, you owe it to yourself to remedy the situation.

Bernie Sanders Would Be The Big Winner In New Public-Funding Model
Enlarge this image toggle caption Jim Cole/AP Jim Cole/AP
What would it take to make the White House wannabes stop chasing after big donors? From 1975 to 1999, the answer was federal matching funds — money that candidates could get by raising more money from small donors and spending less time schmoozing with the well-heeled.
Now, the U.S. PIRG (Public Interest Research Group) Education Fund, an advocate of more limits on campaign money, has produced a model of how that would affect the early stages of the 2016 race. The analysis assumes a 6-to-1 match, so the match would turn a $200 contribution into $1,400 for the candidate.
First the results, then the caveats.
The results:
The big winner — Sen. Bernie Sanders. In the first half of 2015, he got 77 percent of his money in small contributions, that is, $200 or less. Hillary Clinton raised about 3 1/2 times as much as Sanders, but just 13 percent came from small contributions. With matching funds, Sanders would end up with $83 million, Clinton with $89 million.
The big loser — Republican Jeb Bush. He would be the only contender to come out with less money. It reflects the top-heavy profile of Bush's fundraising: 88 percent of his money came from donors who gave $2,700, the legal limit. Republicans who would benefit most are Sen. Ted Cruz and retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson.
The caveats:
Intriguing as this might be, the analysis is far from ironclad.
SuperPACs: For one thing, it doesn't take into consideration superPACs. Every major candidate but Sanders has at least one backing them (that they endorse). SuperPACs have no contribution limits.
A theoretical system with matching funds could also theoretically ban superPACs. But here in 2015, Bush raised $11 million for his campaign committee, and $103 million was raised for the superPAC. In most of the presidential campaigns, the small donors to the candidate's committee look a lot like window dressing.
There are cost-benefit questions: For the 12 candidates, who have reported their fundraising so far, the analysis estimates that $307 million in matching funds would have displaced $65 million in contributions greater than $200. Advocates of public financing say no one can gauge the true benefit: how many federal dollars would be saved if big donors had less sway over lawmakers.
Public financing is a long, long way from reality: The Watergate-era system was abandoned twice, first by candidate George W. Bush in the 2000 primaries, and then by candidate Barack Obama in the 2008 general-election campaign. It's not going to be resurrected — at least not in the short term.
Matching funds programs are included in comprehensive campaign-finance bills proposed by Rep. John Sarbanes, D-Md., and Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill. They're better designed than the old presidential system. But unlike the 1970s — or even 2002, when the McCain-Feingold bill became law — campaign finance has become a partisan issue. The epithet "welfare for politicians" likely still has some punch.
This isn't to say the matching-funds idea should be ignored. The winning candidates this cycle are expected to spend well over $1 billion each. The influence of big money is a frequent topic on the campaign trail. And it's worth exploring what a different system might look like.

President Donald Trump took his first flight aboard Air Force One, the presidential jet, on Thursday to address a joint gathering of House and Senate Republicans in Philadelphia, and the experience left him awestruck.
"Beautiful. Great plane," Trump said about his new ride, according to pool reports.
Trump said his old plane, a Boeing 757, was a "good one," but that Air Force One is a "very special plane for a lot of reasons."
"He continues to react the same way he has throughout his time in his presidency, in awe of the splendor of this plane and what the White House represents," Trump press secretary Sean Spicer, who was on the flight, told reporters.
While Trump's old plane wasn't shabby — it has two bedrooms and a full bathroom with 24-karat gold fixtures — it pales in comparison to the presidential jet, a larger Boeing 747.
Air Force One, though lacking in gold, boasts 4,000 square feet of interior space, with a fully equipped Situation Room and a "flying Oval Office." The plane's fuselage can also withstand a nuclear blast from the ground and has flares hidden in the wings to confuse enemy missiles.
Trump took his first flight on Marine One, the presidential chopper, as well.

The fallout from last week's train collision at Joo Koon station will echo for several more months. It will mean the end of seamless journeys for commuters travelling between Tuas and Pasir Ris on the East-West Line for at least up to June next year.
There will also be early closures along stretches of the East-West Line on Fridays and Saturdays, and late openings on Sundays from Dec 8 to 31 as resignalling works get speeded up to finish by June instead of the end of next year.
This will affect 17 stations from Tiong Bahru to Tuas Link, as well as Bukit Batok and Bukit Gombak stations on the North-South Line.
On Dec 10 and 17, which are Sundays, these stretches will also close for the whole day.
The changes were flagged after it was revealed that the collision was caused by compatibility issues between an old and a new signalling system. To avoid the risk of a repeat incident, the two systems will remain separated till next June.
That means commuters travelling between Tuas and Pasir Ris on the East-West Line will not have a seamless journey for a while. They will have to get off at Joo Koon and take a free bridging bus service to the next stop at Gul Circle, to continue westwards on a line which runs on the new signalling system.
Likewise, on the return trip, they will have to get off at Gul Circle and take the bridging bus service to Joo Koon to continue eastwards.
Stony-faced representatives from SMRT, regulator Land Transport Authority (LTA) and signalling system provider Thales met the media yesterday to reveal their findings on the Nov 15 collision which left 38 people injured. Thales official Millar Crawford said: “We apologise to commuters, in particular to those who were injured.”
Speaking to reporters after the briefing, Transport Minister Khaw Boon Wan said: “When we launched Tuas West Extension, we intended it to be a seamless link from Pasir Ris to Tuas Link. In hindsight, of course, this has introduced a lot of complications... Still, Thales could have done better.”
Related Story Prudent decision to separate old and new signalling systems, and lessons from Joo Koon collision
It has been decided to have “complete separation” between the old and new signalling systems. The old system was originally to be phased out by the end of next year. But to minimise impact on commuters, it is now targeted to end by June.
Meanwhile, the shortened service hours from Dec 8 to Dec 31 will affect 20,000 to 30,000 people, the LTA said, adding that other stretches of the East-West Line will see reduced service hours in the first half of next year too.
The briefing on the Nov 15 incident revealed that a glitch on trainborne signalling equipment disabled a “bubble” which acts like an invisible barrier to prevent trains from colliding. The system then created another bubble.
But the second bubble was disabled when the train passed Clementi station. A trackside device which was modified two days earlier to connect the two signalling systems failed, resulting in compatibility issues between train and track.
At Joo Koon, this train which no longer had the protection of the bubble – rendering it almost invisible to other trains – was hit by another.
Mr Khaw said the collision – as well as the flooding incident – have “shattered” the confidence of commuters. “But it has happened, and we have to get over it and regain the public's confidence.” Upping the reliability of the whole system would be key to this end, he said.
