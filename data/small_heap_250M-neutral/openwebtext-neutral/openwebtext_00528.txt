Trump reportedly questioned their decision to several allies, saying they should've prioritized tax reform after seeing the immediate Republican fallout from the GOP healthcare proposal.
Trump responded to the healthcare chaos with an ultimatum. They sent Office of Management and Budget Director Mick Mulvaney to announce that either Republicans hold a vote on the bill Friday, or they would move on and they would be stuck with ObamaCare.
The "Art of the Deal” business mogul prides themselves in being a skilled negotiator and has been working behind the scenes to whip up votes for the health legislation.
But after throwing their support behind the bill, Trump found themselves pinned between Republicans who find the bill does not do enough to repeal and replace ObamaCare, and Democrats and some moderate Republicans who are worried about the expected rise in the number of uninsured people and the rollback of ObamaCare's Medicaid expansion.
Trump suggested earlier in the week that Republicans who vote against the bill could suffer in the next elections.
Two of Trump's closest White House advisers, their chief strategist Steve Bannon and top economic adviser Gary Cohn also reversed their position on the healthcare bill, first favoring it, and then deciding they did not like the compromise version coming out of meetings this week, the Times reports.
The Times reports Trump did not realize when they agreed to the agenda late last year just how intense of a fight healthcare would be until this week, following harsh criticism and Congressional Budget Office estimates that showed millions more would be uninsured.
This realization has led them to pine about the tax cut plan they should've pursued instead.

John Aloisi confident of success with Brisbane Roar in A-League after tough times in charge of Melbourne Heart
Updated
John Aloisi says they arrive at the Brisbane Roar as a better coach than they were during their time at the Melbourne Heart.
Aloisi's appointment was met with negativity by many Roar fans due to their poor record in their only other stint as a head coach with the Heart.
The former Socceroo lost 24 of their 39 fixtures as Heart coach and at the time of their sacking the team was rooted to the bottom of the table after going 17 matches without a win.
"It was my first job as a head coach, so you learn from the mistakes you make," Aloisi, speaking at their first media conference since taking up the Roar job from interim coach Frans Thijssen, said of their last tenure.
"You probably learn sometimes when you're not successful. You have to look back and see what you didn't do so well.
They've been so successful over the years and I want to help them be successful again. John Aloisi
"I'm really excited about coming to Brisbane Roar and coaching such a talented bunch of players.
"I've been watching from afar, played against them, coached against them, and it was never easy.
"They've been so successful over the years and I want to help them be successful again."
Since being dumped by the Heart, which has since transformed into Melbourne City, in December 2013, Aloisi said they had learned a great deal about coaching.
The 39-year-old has spoked widely to wise heads such as Ange Postecoglou and observing first-hand how successful teams like Spanish heavyweights Barcelona operate.
"Since then I've been able to spend this time pretty wisely, speaking to people that have been successful, like Ange," Aloisi said.
"Ange has been great for me, a mentor.
"I went overseas, spent time with quite a few clubs overseas.
"And able to work on Fox Sports, analysing games, watching the boys play a lot.
"And also coaching the young boys at Melbourne Victory. I really enjoyed working with younger players, I think that's made me a more rounded coach."
Aloisi wants to preserve Roar's style of play
The Roar won three championships in four years under Postecoglou and Mike Mulvey by playing a possession-based, attacking brand of football, and Aloisi said they intended to carry forward that legacy.
"Brisbane Roar have it in their DNA to dominate the game, and that doesn't just mean keeping possession for the sake of keeping possession," they said.
"It means that you take the game to the opposition to hurt them.
"That's another reason why I wanted to come here, because wherever I've gone to study the game has been at clubs that play that way.
"I spent a lot of time at Barcelona, and I'm not saying that we're going to play exactly the same as them, but they've had to play that style because that is in their DNA. Brisbane Roar is the same."
Outgoing Roar chairperson Chris Fong said Aloisi would oversee a fresh start for the club, following a tumultuous 2014/15 season.
"This marks the start of an exciting new era for us, a re-boot as such," Fong said.
"And it's certainly a change of direction that we've been going for the last year or so and we're very excited that we've made this decision, to go with John."

Sanders is absolutely right. Nothing would do more to bring opportunity to young men and women throughout the nation than to make college education at public universities affordable to all. Warren is absolutely right. It is high time to end the crushing burden of student loan debt that afflicts moms and dads, and their sons or daughters, who are hard-pressed to pay back this crushing debt.
The suggestion by Sanders to finance this program through a small tax on Wall Street transaction would be fair, effective and is supported by a long list of Wall Street reformers and financial industry executives.
Let's give a standing ovation to Bernie Sanders for putting this issue at the forefront of the presidential campaign. Let's give a standing ovation to Elizabeth Warren for making student loan reform and relief a central issue in national politics and Congress. Democrats should take this powerful political issue and this great cause of educational opportunity to the voters in 2016 in a platform that is the right thing to do for the students and their parents and the smart political move to propel Democrats to victory in the 2016 campaign.

Many claim that the relationship between Saudi Arabia and Islamic State (IS) is one of patron and client. IS, they argue, is a pawn of the Saudi regime, used to check the “rising” Shi'a power of Iran in the Middle East.
This allegation typically presents certain shared principles between the official Saudi interpretation of Islam and the doctrine motivating IS as damning evidence of complicity between the two.
Although there is a certain truth to this, it assumes a wilful agency on Saudi Arabia's part that simply isn't there. Saudi citizens supporting IS's activities in Iraq and Syria are not the result of a coherent plan directed by the kingdom's rulers, but the overflow of a long-standing system used to maintain its domestic legitimacy.
Evolution of state control
The Saudi state has relied on the ultra-conservative Wahhabi movement since both emerged in the mid-18th century.
Wahhabism was built on the desire to stamp out religious innovation and restore the “proper” Islam. Its initial power rested on two sources – the common distaste among the inhabitants of Central Arabia for such innovation and preacher Muhammad Abd al-Wahhab's ability to channel this grievance into a populist doctrine.
The call produced something never encountered before in the region: a proper mass movement.
The Saudis, a small clan of oasis nobility, formed a symbiotic relationship with Wahhab. It lent them military support in return for the movement's resources and legitimacy. Wahhab agreed to defer all matters of state and politics, restricting clerical activities to administering the social and metaphysical spheres.
As “guardians” of Islam, the Saudis were able to differentiate themselves from their local competitors. Revivalism attached a mass appeal to their mission of conquest in an environment typified by disparate local identities and “petty sheiks”. The resultant state came to be viewed as key to safeguarding the Wahhabi community, a central factor in its expansion over much of the Arabian Peninsula by the late 19th century.
Realising the importance of the ongoing ideological support of its subjects, the Saudi regime sought to instil Wahhabism throughout conquered territories. The primary motivation for Saudi leaders was political. By instilling the revivalist identity into greater numbers of its subjects, the state was creating demand for its own rule.
Key to this effort was the securitisation of heterodox sects, such as the Shi'a. These “others” were presented as a threat to the community's metaphysical integrity due to their inauthentic practices, which were not encountered during Islam's early period. The logic dictated that their existence necessitated a higher authority to moderate society and ensure the correct Islamic form was maintained.
This is hardly a novel concept. States commonly construct threats of external war and terror in order to gain domestic power. A by-product of such activities has often been the rise of destructive exclusivist nationalism and xenophobia.
Where the Saudi state remains novel is in its use of a purely metaphysical threat, the extent that it has relied on this to maintain its position, and the longevity of the effort itself.

Glitches in the system
The state's arms have commonly been employed to ensure this status quo. Saudi Arabia's education system has been criticised for promoting a radicalising, sectarian narrative that encourages violence against those outside the sanctioned community.
But while Saudi Arabia has carefully crafted an image as Islam's protector, it nevertheless has aimed to keep policymaking pragmatic, not ideological. Decisions of economic and foreign policy have tended to be dominated by technocrats, not clerics. In this, religion is often invoked, but generally when it is instrumental to a wider political goal.
Ironically, for Saudis this arrangement has meant that the state has been a prominent promoter of the “innovation” so detested in classical revivalist thought.
This tension has occasionally produced outbreaks of violence. The 1927 Ikhwan revolt was sparked in part by King Abd al-Aziz's refusal to exterminate the Shi'a of al-Hasa and their diplomatic relations with external “infidel” powers.
Similarly, the 1979 Siege of Mecca was a rejection of the previous two decades of radical modernisation initiated by King Faisal. The 2003 attacks by al-Qaeda inside Saudi Arabia were partially motivated by its accommodation of “infidels”.
Historically, this blowback has been largely domestic. Only since the 1990s have these types of unintended outcomes been felt internationally.
This shift can be attributed to several factors. The most prominent among them was Saudi Arabia's tacit support for participation in the Afghanistan wars of the 1980s.
The primary motivation for this was not one of ideology, but political pragmatism. Saudi Arabia was experiencing an economic downturn in which household incomes fell by more than half and unemployment skyrocketed. At the same time the regime was struggling with a rising Islamist current in the wake of the Iranian revolution, which was increasingly calling into question its legitimacy to rule.
With a large number of disenfranchised young men at home, a rival power walking into a geopolitical beartrap and a need to appear to the Muslim community to be increasingly activist, the decision was aimed at killing three birds with one stone. Thanks to its strong influence over domestic Islamic identity, it took little encouragement to mobilise thousands of young Saudis into a conflict with a new infidel threat. Although Saudi Arabia began actively discouraging such behaviour after the Soviet withdrawal in 1989, the genie had been let out of the bottle.
Saudis continued to flock to “pan-Islamic” conflicts throughout the 1990s and the 2000s – in Kosovo, Tajikistan, Chechnya, Iraq and, most recently, Syria. They gravitated towards religiously hardline groups, whose ideologies meshed well with the sectarian narrative of their upbringing.
Treating the symptom, not the wound
While Saudi Arabia has made several attempts to stem the flow of fighters and finances to groups like IS, it has been careful not to appear overly oppressive for fear of antagonising its own constituents. It may decry such groups, but it continues to promote a system that inadvertently supports them.
Revivalist scholars claim that Saudi Arabia's doctrine is intrinsically opposed to the IS worldview. They cite esoteric textual minutiae to support such assertions. But such arguments miss a wider point: the issues at play are far less about literary nuance than the wider emotional, psychological and sociological themes that Saudi Arabia promotes in its populace.
Such structures created a demand for sectarian confrontation in some people that cannot be met by the state and which drives them towards radical action. Until such deeper issues are dealt with, other responses will merely be token.
Unfortunately, the domestic efficacy of Saudi Arabia's control means that it is unlikely to be reformed any time soon. The state's manipulation of its population's sectarianism during the Arab Spring, for example, was key to its effective management of the 2011 crisis.
Within this wider context, the ruling elite see the extremist habits of a small number of Saudis as an unfortunate yet tolerable side-effect of a system that has allowed them to remain in power for nearly 300 years.
This certainly does not diminish the Saudi state's culpability. But it does pose the question: how does one change an entire system of popular governance that inadvertently produces such outcomes and appears structurally incapable of preventing them?
Evidently, Buck Showalter had seen enough Aaron Judge highlights for one series.
Still, the Orioles' manager went to extreme measures to avoid Judge in the bottom of the ninth of the Yankees' 6-4 loss Sunday in The Bronx.
With Clint Frazier on third and two outs, Showalter opted to have closer Zach Britton walk Judge intentionally.
From one perspective, the move made some sense, since Judge has tormented the Orioles like no other team this season. They entered Sunday with 11 homers and a 1.688 OPS in 18 games against Baltimore — by far their best numbers against any team.
From some others, it was a head-scratching decision.
It allowed the Yankees to bring the winning run to the plate. And the batter coming to the plate was the red-hot Gary Sanchez.
“Just pick your poison there,” Showalter said.
Britton responded by striking out Sanchez to end the game — and potentially to take Showalter off the hook.
“They're both really good hitters,'' Showalter said of Judge and Sanchez. “I have confidence in Zach with either one. It came up heads today. Tomorrow it might be tails.”
“It takes one mistake,” Joe Girardi said. “[Britton] didn't make one.”
Good fortune aside, Showalter declined to elaborate much on why they would risk a game-winning homer.
“I'm not gonna get into it,'' the former Yankees manager said. “They're both really good hitters and a threat. They're having a big year and gonna have great careers.”
Judge had never faced Britton, and Sanchez went into the at-bat hitless in three plate appearances, with a pair of strikeouts.
“That's baseball,'' Sanchez said through an interpreter of the Orioles choosing to go after him, rather than Judge. “That's the way baseball is. It's not the first time or the last time it will happen.”
Britton made it clear that's not the way they would have drawn up the inning.
“It's not something I would have [chosen],'' said Britton, who admitted they didn't expect to get the signal to send Judge to first. “Now with the [new] rule, it kind of surprises you for a second. I just figured, ‘Now I've got to get Sanchez.' I wanted to attack Judge. I liked my chances [against Judge], but it's not my call.”
Asked whether they understood Showalter's decision, Britton said: “You'd have to ask him. Like I said, it wasn't my call. My job is to attack the next guy.”
Showalter expected that reaction from Britton, who has dealt with a forearm strain this season.
“I know Zach wasn't happy about it,” Showalter said.
And Showalter noted that Judge wasn't the only Yankees hitter who has beaten up their team this season.
Asked if Judge's success was the reason, Showalter said: “If that was the case, we'd walk just about all of them. … They're two really good young hitters. There wasn't anybody standing at first. I'm trying to give us the best chance to win.”

If you're pregnant, and you've heard the words "it's a boy," you may be wondering about circumcision.
My first advice to parents is: you have a choice.
For some of my patients, there are religious or cultural beliefs that will guide their decision. For others, it may be that the baby's father is circumcised, or not, that is the driving force in their decision. As an obstetrician, I'm often asked, "What does the science say?"
In recent years, circumcision of babies in Canada has dropped, with estimates that around 30 per cent of newborn males are now circumcised. In the fall of 2015, the Canadian Paediatric Society issued a position statement on newborn male circumcision. It states that routine circumcision for every newborn male is not recommended. That's not to say that circumcision is harmful, but there isn't medical evidence saying that the good significantly outweighs the bad.
It is worth noting that several clinician-researchers in Canada have been critical of the Society's statement, and groups such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the United States suggest that the benefits of circumcision outweigh the negatives.
Benefits of circumcision
The medical evidence summarized in the Canadian Paediatric Society's statement runs through the potential benefits of circumcision, including the reduction of:
Foreskin conditions: The foreskin can become inflamed or infected in one to four per cent of uncircumcised boys. Topical steroids usually help this, but there is a small chance that these conditions could result in circumcision as treatment. Urinary tract infections: Research shows a slight reduction in urinary tract infections in circumcised boys. It is worth noting that this is quite a modest number, and has a low chance of impacting long-term kidney function. Sexually transmitted diseases: Studies in Africa show that uncircumcised males have a higher chance of contracting HIV/AIDS. It's difficult to draw the same conclusions for developed countries like Canada, as our rates of HIV/AIDS are much lower. The Society does encourage that focus should be on other preventive measures, such as abstinence, condom use and other safe sex practices.
Risks of circumcision
The Society also looked at the potential risks of circumcision, including:
It hurts: It's no surprise, surgical procedures are painful, and there is some pain while the baby's penis is healing. Small risk of infection: There's a 1.5 per cent chance of medical complication, such as minor bleeding or local infection. An impact on sexuality sensitivity: A study of circumcised and uncircumcised men in 2013 suggests that the foreskin enhances sexual pleasure.
When should my baby be circumcised?
If you decide to get your baby circumcised, the best time for elective circumcision is between birth and eight weeks when the foreskin in thinner. The timing within this range may vary depending on your religious or cultural beliefs.
In the Jewish faith, circumcision is done when a baby is eight days old. In some Islamic communities, circumcision is carried out in babies, while in others it is carried out when the child is older.
What if your baby was born prematurely? In this case, and especially if your baby is in the neonatal intensive care unit or NICU, it's often recommended to wait to circumcise once the baby is old enough and well enough to be discharged from the hospital.
If you opt for circumcision:
The one thing I can't stress enough to patients that choose to have their sons circumcised is that they be referred to a practitioner who is trained in the procedure and strictly adheres to medical best practices. Circumcisions should only be performed by trained practitioners whose skills are up-to-date.
Talk to your midwife, family doctor or obstetrician for recommendations. Your baby should also be closely followed after the procedure, and you should have a good sense of how to care for the circumcised penis and possible complications.
Remember, this is your decision as parents, and you will make it with the best intentions for the new addition to your family.

The video shows officers yelling at people to get out of their minivan. As the elderly man exists the passenger seat, the officer grabs their hand and twists it. Another officer came and told the first officer to “let them go.” After they did, the second officer tased the old man.
The man who filmed the video claims they were with their family on the way to Key West for the weekend.
A woman off-camera says in the video "Get out of the car. Oh jeez. They are not getting out of the car. The guy on the other side, on the driver's side, is going a bit banana, no?”
"The police here are heavy-handed," they say. When a young girl in the videographer's car asks what's going on, the woman says, "They are trying to get these people of this car, sweetie. I don't know why. It's kind of weird."
Witnesses gasp in terror questioning if the man was still alive.
“I hope we don't get harassed because I'm recording this,” the man filming states before turning off the camera.
This is not the first instance of police tasering to headlines in Key West this year. Earlier in January, Key Largo teen Roberto Ornelas died after being shot with a taser on new Year's Day.
A recent investigation by the Miami New Times shows that South Florida cops have a history of misusing their tasers, including several deaths linked to the devices.
The Miami New Times reported that more than 17,000 police departments in the United States, including some Miami precincts. Taser International, the makers of the taser that shocked the old man, has become a $ 1.37 billion dollar company.
Amid all the controversy in using tasers Amnesty International reports between 2001 and 2008, 351 people in the United States died from being shocked by police tasers.
The incident is currently under investigation," said FHP spokesperson Captain Nancy Rasmussen, who declined to release more details
The official launch of application server WildFly 8.0 is creeping ever closer, but in the meantime, RC1 is already making considerable waves. Just last week, it was deemed worthy of being added to Oracle's list full fully platform compatible implementations of Java EE 7 – further consolidating its position as worthy spiritual successor to GlassFish.
With new cachet, the server now has added appeal for companies looking to migrate to Java EE7, or those that have made the jump, but are looking for a viable, buoyant GlassFish alternative.
The thriving, active community around popular server GlassFish was dealt a body blow last November when it was announced in a roadmap update that, going forward, there would be no more commercial major releases. Although Bruno Borges was at pains to reassure users that the offering was far from finished, with evangelist Arun Gupta's abrupt departure to RedHat, for many, the writing was on the wall.
Even now, Oracle is still mopping up from this fallout, with Oracle staffer David Delabassee taking to the GlassFish blog this January with a post emphasising that commercial support for GlassFish 3.x is set to continue “for years to come.”
This support isn't the same as full backing though – something GlassFish blog guest authors Hildeberto Mendonça and Efraim Gentil from CEJUG pointed out in a post last week, where, in a pointed jab at Oracle, they wrote, “serious” open source projects need the backing of at least one company with a “genuine interest to be profitable with that project in the long run.”
The writers added that, “It's a matter of fitting the project in the current economic model, where people can be employed full time to address the continuous flow of issues and features coming from users all over the world. That's what happens all the time at RedHat and that's what stopped happening at Oracle in the case of GlassFish.”
Of course, the road ahead is still open for ‘the one true' successor to GlassFish. Also in contention for this role is the Apache server TomEE. There are also the options of LodgON and C2B2 , which have both arisen to offer a lifeline to jilted GlassFish users. Finally, there's also the prospect that the GlassFish community could muster it's resources and turn the project into a powerful open-source prospect – though this would need some serious clout to help drive it.
Android is stepping towards the success day by day and this year has turned to be the most Successful year for Google as the Android has registered 5.2% year-on-year. Google's Android OS has been and will remain the majority share platform in smartphones for the foreseeable future.
According to IDC report, Android's market share for this year will stand at 85%, after achieving a year-on-year growth of 5.2%. iOS, on the other hand, will claim 14.3% of the market, having seen its shipments decrease by 11%.
The iPhone 7 does not stand on the people expectation as iOS have registered three-quarters of year-over-year declines, as well as a projected fourth quarter decline by IDC. All signs point to 2016 being the first full year of declining shipments for Apple's iPhone.
In total, Google's and Apple's mobile operating systems will claim over 99% of the market, leaving just 0.4% share for Windows Phone and 0.3% for others. The combined share for Android and iOS will reach nearly 100% by 2020, the report says.
Much of this growth is coming from emerging markets (Asia/Pacific excluding Japan, Latin America, Central and Eastern Europe, and the Middle East and Africa), where only 61% of 2015 smartphone shipments were 4G-enabled compared to IDC's 2016 projection of 77%. Mature markets (USA, Canada, Japan, and Western Europe) are further along the 4G adoption curve with 85% in 2015 and a projected 94% in 2016, respectively.
There is also an important Role of the low-cost 4G smartphone in the growth of Android. The report also reveals that shipments of 4G smartphones are all set to hit the 1 billion mark this year.

Entire oceans of ink have been spilled over the question of how much of Trump's support came from prejudice versus economic anxiety (hint: it's both and they're interconnected.) But no matter the answer, what's clear by now is that Trump's economic populist agenda on behalf of the white working class no longer exists if it ever did. Their betrayals of Main Street on behalf of Wall Street have been gradual and numerous, but two executive orders yesterday seal the deal:
President Trump signed a set of executive actions Friday ordering a review of significant 2016 tax regulations along with two separate reviews aimed at rolling back Dodd-Frank financial regulations. The president visited the Treasury Department to sign the actions, saying the administration wants to “help to struggle Americans achieve their financial dreams, earn a great paycheck, have a job that they love going to every single day and have real confidence in the future.” They also teased that there will be a “big announcement” on tax reform next Wednesday. The first action is an executive order that directs the Treasury Secretary to review “all significant 2016 tax regulations to determine if they impose an undue financial burden on taxpayers, are needlessly complex, create unnecessary requirements, or exceed what's allowed under law.”
Trump has trussed up giveaways to Wall Street in worker-friendly language, but the intent is clear: to give the finance industry free rein to predate at will–though as Matt Yglesias notes, even the executive orders themselves are empty legislative husks designed to give Trump the illusion of accomplishments before the 100-day mark. Still, even an empty gift to Wall Street remains a gift.
There is now nothing left of Trump's promises to workers. Better healthcare and lower premiums than the Affordable Care Act? Nope. Pressure against Chinese currency manipulation and offshoring of jobs? Not anymore. Keeping advisers who listen to Trump's base instead of Goldman Sachs? Suckers.
Greg Sargent at the Washington Post has been pounding this theme for the last couple of weeks now. Whatever may have motivated Trump's voters in the election, Trump themselves is now banking that pure bigotry will keep the ground troops in line while they loot the treasury on behalf of themselves and the traditional Republican plutocratic class.
Wall Street and GOP elites may be glad to see Trump reverting to form on the issues that matter to them. But — while these elites would perhaps like to see immigration reform — how much do they really care about the ugly nativist stuff that's proceeding under the radar? Meanwhile, the trips to Mar-a-Lago (which use the White House to enrich the Trump family) and the refusal to release Trump's tax returns and show transparency about their finances (which allows untold other conflicts of interest to remain undetected) doesn't appear to concern them too much, either. The “economic” nationalism is no longer operative (if it ever was), but the ethno-nationalism and the corruption are running as strong as ever.
If the Vox-aligned crowd is right–they're not, but just for the sake of argument–that it was purely racism and not economic anxiety and working-class nationalism that motivated Trump's base, then none of this will matter. But there is significant evidence that Trump's voters are waking up to their lies, and that Trump's abandonment of the core economic issues they promised will seriously hurt them and their party. That will be especially true if Democrats take a stronger economic populist stance as party leaders seem more willing to do than ever before.
01:05 5 Things to Look for in March Meteorologist Danielle Banks highlights a few weather tendencies to look for when the calendar turns to March.
At a Glance Record lows and record-cold highs were set during an initial blast of chilly air across the East during the Labor Day weekend.
Another invasion of fall-like temperatures is on the way this week east of the Rockies.
Sept. 1 marked the beginning of meteorological fall, which runs until Nov. 30, and for parts of the East and South, this is coinciding with another round of cool temperatures in the week ahead.
A southward dip in the jet stream, or upper-level trough, was the common weather pattern during the summer in the East, while a northward bulge in the jet stream, or upper-level ridge, often set up in the West. This overall pattern will continue during the first full week of September as the trough sweeps almost as far south as the Gulf Coast.
Temperatures are typically below average underneath a trough as cooler air is drawn southward out of Canada, and a blast of true fall-like air will engulf the eastern and southern states at times during the upcoming work week.

This Week: Another Shot of Cool Air
Temperatures started the week closer to average, but another cold front will now sweep through much of the East and South into Wednesday.
(MAPS: 10-Day Forecast High/Low Temperatures )
This next cool shot will drop temperatures generally 10 to 20 degrees below average mid- to late week across parts of the central and eastern U.S.
This means highs will be in the 60s and 70s across the Northeast, mid-Atlantic, Midwest and even much of the South by Wednesday and Thursday.
(MAPS: Average Monthly Temperatures )
Widespread lows in the 50s are expected as far south as the interior Southeast and mid-South region mid- to late week. From the upper Mississippi Valley and Great Lakes to the interior Northeast, many locations may fall into the 30s and 40s.
This may lead to a few record daily lows late this week (current record in parentheses):
On Thursday morning record lows are possible are in the following location : Kansas City (47 degrees); Nashville (49 degrees); Huntsville, Alabama (51 degrees); Charlotte, North Carolina (53 degrees) and Atlanta (56 degrees).
On Friday morning, record lows may occur in: Nashville (51 degrees); Tupelo, Mississippi (53 degrees); Birmingham, Alabama (54 degrees); Memphis (54 degrees); Charlotte, North Carolina (54 degrees); Atlanta (56 degrees); Montgomery, Alabama (57 degrees); San Antonio (59 degrees).
A few record cold high temperatures are also possible in parts of the Midwest, Ohio Valley and Great Lakes regions, including Indianapolis on Wednesday and Binghamton, New York on Thursday.
Labor Day Weekend Chill
Several record lows were set going into the Labor Day holiday weekend from an initial blast of chilly air.
Friday morning, record lows were set in Alpena, Michigan (36 degrees - tied); Watertown, New York (37 degrees - tied); Flint, Michigan (39 degrees); Binghamton, New York (42 degrees); Syracuse, New York (42 degrees - tied); Poughkeepsie, New York (43 degrees) and Bridgeport, Connecticut (52 degrees - tied).
Saturday morning, additional record lows were broken, including in Glens Falls, New York (34 degrees); Albany, New York (38 degrees); Binghamton, New York (39 degrees - tied); Syracuse, New York (40 degrees - tied); Poughkeepsie, New York (40 degrees); Hartford, Connecticut (41 degrees); Springfield, Illinois (42 degrees); Providence, Rhode Island (46 degrees); Newark, New Jersey (49 degrees) and New York City's LaGuardia Airport (56 degrees - tied).
A few record-cold high temperatures have also been observed. Friday, the following cities set new records for coolest high temperature for the date: Dayton, Ohio (59 degrees); Columbus, Ohio (62 degrees); Pittsburgh (63 degrees) and Watertown, New York (64 degrees).
In 1993, the San Francisco Giants won 103 games and missed the postseason. Unless the wild card system is eliminated in the future, that will be the last time in baseball history something like that happens. It was the best of times, it was the worst of times.
Here's how their season ended:
Mike Piazza was a rookie, and Giants fans immediately knew they were going to be a villain for a long, long time. Maybe it was the look — the undercover-detective-trying-to-fit-in-at-West-Beverly chic — that tipped us off. Maybe it was the personal ties to Tommy Lasorda, just as the jade runestones foretold.
For me? It was that opposite-field swing. Look at those two home runs again.
Piazza stood off the plate, daring pitchers to throw them pitches on the outer half. Because for 100 years or so, if a hitter even made contact with a pitch that far away from where they set up, it will just be a harmless fly ball. It took a season for them to rewrite a scouting report that was encoded in the double helix of baseball.
They were a rookie who let the ball get deep like no rookie I've ever seen before or since, a hitter confident they could go the other way and put it out of any ballpark. And they happened to play the position where teams were supposed to have the hardest time finding a legitimate hitter. They were 24, and they were just about the best head start to any roster in baseball.
Four-and-a-half years later, the Los Angeles Dodgers traded them to the Florida Marlins. I'm not going to say it was the happiest day of my life, but I will point out that I timed my wedding to be on the same date, just so I would never forget my anniversary.
They aren't traded for magic beans. They were traded for another 29-year-old superstar, Gary Sheffield, who also kept me up at night. The Dodgers were finishing in second and third place with Piazza, and they'd continue to finish in second and third place with Sheffield. It didn't matter to me. All I could think, over and over again, was that Piazza was gone. Piazza was off the Dodgers. There wouldn't be that sinking feeling when watching a Giants pitcher go to a three-ball count to a batter with Piazza on deck. They were gone.
That was the irrational thought process of a fan, though. I want to explore the trade from a rational perspective almost two decades later. Let's look at this dispassionately and see what the Dodgers were thinking.
Piazza was going to be a free agent after the season, and the negotiations were public and ugly. They were looking for Jeff Samardzija money, for crying out loud, why wouldn't they be ugly? They had finished second for the MVP the year before after hitting .362 with 40 homers. Again, that's a catcher doing that, and in retrospect, it turns out that all of the concern-trolling about their defense was misplaced. They were an excellent player with a unique, unfathomable skill set, and they wanted to be paid as such.
The Dodgers were bought by Fox a few months before, and their plan had to involve keeping the franchise icon around. A media conglomerate doesn't buy a chunk of entertainment just to make it less appealing to the people already consuming it. Still, they didn't want to set any records with Piazza's extension, and the court of public opinion always turns against the millionaires wanting more millions, if only because billionaires wanting to save millions will always be more palatable, for some reason.
Hey Mike, Zip It!
An actual headline. There was an honest chance that the Dodgers were going to watch their star player walk away. The new owners couldn't abide by that. They bought a team that was furnished with a popular superstar to show on TV. They needed to keep one of those around, but there was a chance it wasn't going to happen.
So instead of paying a 29-year-old catcher $100 million to play until they were 36, they exchanged them for a 29-year-old superstar who was under contract for four more seasons, and the Marlins threw in a Gold Glove All-Star catcher, a 35-year-old slugger coming off a solid year and a pinch-hitting specialist just to get rid of the contracts.
It ... it was a brilliant deal, at least from a tactical standpoint. Sheffield was a surly fellow who actually played the outfield like people thought Piazza played catcher, but they were one of the best hitters in baseball, and they would be around for about the same contract the Dodgers were willing to give Piazza. Charles Johnson was a dreadful hitter for the rest of the season, but they sure made sense at the time.
After the season, they traded Johnson for Todd Hundley, who was the Badfinger to Piazza's Paul McCartney. You could hardly tell the difference for a while!
It was a shrewd, bold shuffling of assets, a diversification of investments that limited the risk. You can see why the new corporate owners loved it.
Flash forward 18 years, and Tommy Lasorda's godson, the face of the Dodgers, the scariest hitter I've ever watched is going into the Hall of Fame as a New York Met. That's the team with which they won the pennant, where they hit the iconic post-9/11 home run, where they stuck around for eight years to the Dodgers' six.
The Dodgers traded a popular generational talent, and all they got was this bold new portfolio.
Is the lesson to never make the cold, calculated deals, to always follow your heart and do what the fans want? Nope. Can't be that. If Piazza aged like catchers usually age, this deal would have looked brilliant almost immediately. Again, it was a smart move. And it's not like Sheffield didn't keep hitting — they most certainly did. They helped the Dodgers win roughly as much.
Is the lesson to keep fan favorites at all costs, regardless of how it will affect the roster? Nope. Can't be that. Ryan Howard isn't the perfect example, but there isn't a lot of "Thank goodness he's a lifelong Phillie. I can't imagine them in another uniform" goodwill in Philadelphia right now. Maybe there will be in 20 years, but not now.
The lesson is that the Dodgers should have kept this player, this Hall of Famer. This is a lesson that can be learned only with the powers of hindsight. This isn't an opinion that's meant to needle Dodgers fans. If I wanted to do that, I'd make a gratuitous Pedro Martinez reference somewhere in the article, and I'm more professional than that. It's just a note from a Giants fan about the player who terrified me more than any other, the monster in my anxiety closet for years.
Right when I started becoming baseball-obsessed, there was this guy on the Dodgers who could do things I'd never seen before, whose bat control and raw power were historically rare for any hitter, much less a catcher. They were going to be a Dodger forever and ever, because the greatest Dodgers usually were. Instead, they became the problem of Braves and Phillies fans. It was a smart trade by the Dodgers, yet it still turned out to be one of my favorite trades of all-time. That's a weird sentence to re-read.
Mike Piazza, one of the greatest hitters in baseball history, the best hitting catcher in baseball history, is going into the Hall of Fame. Their legacy is clear on the baseball field. To me, though, he's a living argument that it's not always bad to have a little emotion behind your transactions. And the alternate timeline where the Fox-led Dodgers realized that still scares the absolute bejeepers out of me.

Ministers to rethink decision to rule out runway after warning that trade will move elsewhere unless airport expanded
Radical options to increase airport capacity in the south-east – including developing RAF Northolt on the edge of London – are being urgently considered by the government amid growing fears that its decision to rule out a third runway at Heathrow is choking off economic growth.
According to senior sources, both David Cameron and George Osborne have been convinced of the need to act – and re-examine long-term policy on Heathrow – after being lobbied by overseas leaders and business figures who warn that trade will move elsewhere in the EU unless the airport is expanded.
While the coalition agreement rules out a third runway at Heathrow, which would never be tolerated by the pro-green Liberal Democrats, many Tories now want the party to admit the decision was wrong and back the new runway in the manifesto for the next general election. In the meantime, however, ministers have ordered officials to examine a series of other options. One is the use of RAF Northolt in Ruislip, north-west London, for business flights, to ease pressure on Heathrow, just 13 miles away. Developing Northolt – and perhaps connecting it to Heathrow with a high speed rail link – would allow the government to avoid accusations of a U-turn as the third runway would then be some distance from the main airport.
Tim Yeo, the Tory chairperson of the energy and climate change select committee, said that they had "completely changed" their mind on Heathrow expansion and now believed there was no option but to build a third runway to ensure the south of England remained a worldwide aviation hub.
Reflecting the views of many in their party, they said: "We cannot wait around any longer. We have to get on with this. If we don't, the Chinese and others will take their business elsewhere. There is no time to delay."
Yeo, a countryside minister in John Major's government and a strong environmentalist, said that new EU rules which came into force in January and placed a cap on overall emissions for flights that start or finish in the EU had "changed the argument completely" and given ministers cover to change course.
"If we build a new runway, people can no longer say emissions will soar as there is a cap," they said. "I think there is a major rethink going on and there needs to be." They said that plans by Boris Johnson, the mayor of London, for a new airport in the Thames estuary, which are also being looked at by ministers, were "too expensive and in the wrong place".
Another alternative to expansion of Heathrow would be to build a second runway at Gatwick. Cameron provided a strong hint last week that this was on the table. "I'm not blind to the need to increase airport capacity, particularly in the south-east," they said. "Gatwick is emerging as a business airport for London under a new owner, competing with Heathrow. No construction work could start at Gatwick until 2019 but this would not stop officials drawing up plans to establish a framework."
In their budget speech on Wednesday, Osborne said that a landmark report on aviation policy, expected this week, had been delayed. Officials said this was to allow the announcement of a "call for evidence" on how the south-east could retain its "hub capacity".
The delay suggests that ministers are scrambling to formulate a coherent strategy for the future of Britain's airports and believe that the status quo is not an option.
Nic Ferriday of AirportWatch, which opposes airport expansion, played down the idea of RAF Northolt being used. "The runway would have to be realigned," they said. "It's also several miles from Heathrow." Complex air traffic control issues would have to be overcome.
Initial reports to government on Northolt's suitability also suggest problems, particularly with the runway length, although changes have not been ruled out.
Any indication that discussions on a third runway at Heathrow could be re-opened would spark a furore – particularly with Lib Dems who would see it as a betrayal of the green cause. Vince Cable, the business secretary, whose Twickenham constituency is on the Heathrow flight path, would oppose it vigorously. Justine Greening, the transport secretary and MP for Putney, Roehampton and Southfields in south-west London, would also resist a change of policy, having opposed a third runway before the last election.
Other Tories would also be strongly opposed. Speaking at a Guardian "open weekend" on Saturday Zac Goldsmith, the Tory MP for Richmond Park and North Kingston, said they would resign as an MP if the party did a U-turn.
Gareth Thomas, Labour MP for Harrow West, which would be affected by flights into Northolt, said there were clear signs that ministers were rethinking their strategy. "I think the government has to come clean and decide what it is going to do."
Last month, Heathrow's China traffic, including Hong Kong flights, fell 0.7%. In 2011, traffic grew 3%, compared with growth of 9% in Paris and Frankfurt. BAA, the airports operator, has campaigned for a third runaway at Heathrow, but its proposals have failed to gain traction.
The government's climate change committee will publish a report next week outlining the need for the UK to reduce its carbon emissions through a series of incremental cuts until 2050.

★In commemoration of episode 69 “Goku vs Arale! The Earth Ends in a Wacky Battle?!”, airing Sunday, December 4th, we've got a super-special interview with Masako Nozawa-san (voice of Goku) and Mami Koyama-san (voice of Arale), plus a preview shot!
Goku and Arale run into each other for the first time in ages!
Koyama:
I was so happy when I heard they were doing an episode where Goku fights Arale-chan! I'm a big Mako-san [Masako Nozawa] fan, so it was a pleasure to get to work with them again!… I can't believe I get to see Arale-chan‘s world of Penguin Village once more. I was so happy when I heard they were doing an episode where Goku fights Arale-chan! I'm a big Mako-san [Masako Nozawa] fan, so it was a pleasure to get to work with them again!… I can't believe I get to see Arale-chan‘s world of Penguin Village once more. Nozawa:
I figure Goku is probably happy about getting to fight Arale-chan! But I bet they won't just go “hey, they seem strong”; he'll be more like “boy, this sure takes me back!” Because Goku becomes friends with everybody before too long. Koyama:
I still remember the first time I got to work with Mako-san. I was still just a rookie, and didn't even know which way was up… I was working overtime recording 30 to 40 episodes, while in contrast Mako-san was giving a really energetic performance…! Nozawa:
The atmosphere in the recording sessions hasn't changed a bit since back then (laughs). Koyama:
When I was a beginner, I would look at Mako-san and be astounded at how they could talk so well with such perfect timing.
Things are lively even in the studio
Koyama:
This recording was a delight too! There was a spirit of friendly competition in the studio, which made things a lot of fun. This recording was a delight too! There was a spirit of friendly competition in the studio, which made things a lot of fun. Nozawa:
It sure was fun here! And communicating that is important too, right? We all have a fun time talking because we want to bring the atmosphere inside the studio into the images onscreen. Koyama:
We all really did manage to record that fun studio atmosphere. And a lot of our fellow performers are from the generation that grew up watching Dr. Slump: Arale-chan and Dragon Ball… so they might have enjoyed it even more than us (laughs). Nozawa:
Yeah! Since everyone from that generation watched those shows. Koyama:
It's been such a long time since I've had this many lines as Arale, so it was hard to prepare. I went to voice training to practice doing a high-pitched voice. Nozawa:
It's only natural. After all, you've got to go “ki—in!“1 Koyama:
When I went “ki—in!“, my voice was so high-pitched that I gave myself a headache (laughs). I bet I was really annoying… (sweat) Nozawa:
Oh no, not at all! It was really cute. Koyama:
Really?! I'm so happy!
The characters live on in their hearts
Nozawa:
Characters that you voice for a long time always remain in your heart. They definitely stay with the actors. Characters that you voice for a long time always remain in your heart. They definitely stay with the actors. Koyama:
Yeah, I find Arale cute. And so part of me thinks “I helped create her!”, and that feeling sticks with me; I treasure that feeling. Nozawa:
That sort of feeling is definitely precious. Koyama:
When I looked at the pictures, that feeling came back to me. I felt it throughout my entire body! I guess my cells got excited or something. Nozawa:
Even Goku's a bit different than usual. It must be because Arale's there. He's happy their friend came! That's so like him; I love it. Koyama:
There really is love there. In both Dragon Ball and Dr. Slump. Since there's love there, it makes it so much fun to do.
Dragon Ball is 30 and Dr. Slump is 35! Everyone please enjoy this collaboration together!
Gun background checks hit new record on Black Friday – at two per second
The FBI processed a record number of firearms background checks on Black Friday – the same day that Robert Lewis Dear allegedly killed three people and wounded nine others at a Planned Parenthood in Colorado.
Gun stocks surge as Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama call for tougher laws Read more
A record 185,345 background checks – roughly two a second – were processed last Friday, the agency said on Tuesday. The FBI received 5% more requests than the same day last year. Before this Black Friday, last year's unofficial sale shopping holiday was the second highest day for firearm background checks. Black Fridays from 2012 and 2013 also made it to the FBI's list of top 10 days for background checks, with 154,873 and 144,758 checks respectively.
“This was an approximate 5% increase over the 175,754 received on Black Friday 2014,” Stephen Fischer, the FBI's chief of multimedia productions, told USA Today. “The previous high for receipts were the 177,170 received on 21 December 2012.”
That previous record for the most background checks in a single day was about a week after 20 children and six adults were shot to death at Sandy Hook elementary school in Connecticut. In the week following the massacre, a total of 953,613 background checks were processed.

FBI background checks processed by the National Instant Criminal Background Check System are conducted for federally licensed gun purchases and for permits to carry guns. A background check does not mean a gun was purchased but manufacturers rely on the background check statistics as a measurement of the industry's health. Additionally, multiple guns can be purchased with one sale, which requires just one background check.
The FBI started processing background checks for potential gun owners in 1998 as part of the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act.
The demand for guns has been on the rise since president Barack Obama took office. According to the above graph published by the NICS, the top 10 days and top 10 weeks for the highest number of background checks have all taken place during Obama's two terms. Obama has previously called for stricter gun control and did so again after the Colorado shooting on Friday.
“The last thing Americans should have to do, over the holidays or any day, is comfort the families of people killed by gun violence,” Obama said in a statement on Saturday, a day after the Planned Parenthood shooting.
This is not normal. We can't let it become normal. If we truly care about this – if we're going to offer up our thoughts and prayers again, for God knows how many times, with a truly clean conscience – then we have to do something about the easy accessibility of weapons of war on our streets to people who have no business wielding them. Period. Enough is enough.
Oregon shooting: 13 legally purchased weapons found in gunman's cache Read more
Renewed calls for tougher gun control laws sent gun stocks surging earlier this year. After a shooting at Umpqua Community College left 10 dead, including a gunman, Obama said that it should not be “easy for somebody who wants to inflict harm on other people to get their or their hands on a gun”. At the time, Democratic presidential and former secretary of state Hillary Clinton unveiled a plan calling for tougher background checks at gun shows and online.
Such calls sent gun stocks surging – by as much as 7% – on expectations of increased sales.
According to an analysis by CNN Money, over the last five years Smith & Wesson and Sturm, Ruger stocks have gained 320%, outperforming profitable companies like Apple. Smith & Wesson sales hit a record high of $626m last year, up 6.7% from $587.5m in 2013.

If you have ever looked deeply into what created the financial pension crisis in Puerto Rico you'd have to admit the potential for a federal bailout is beyond absurd. But that won't stop the insufferable liberals from proposing such a possibility – and watch closely as House Speaker Paul Ryan begins to discuss the “outcome for the bond-holders”.
Former presidential candidate Marco Rubio already stated they were in favor of a bailout, albeit with conditions; and we know the Democrats will always look to gain political leverage through the advocacy of the fiscally stupid….
NEW YORK — Over a dozen activists descended on a building where Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen and their three living predecessors were speaking on Thursday to demand that the Fed bail out Puerto Rico's cash-strapped government.
The demonstrators, who are affiliated with the progressive Fed Up coalition, distributed Puerto Rican flags and empanadas as Puerto Rican music played outside Manhattan's International House, a student residence. Yellen was there for an extremely rare panel discussion alongside past Fed chairs Ben Bernanke, Paul Volcker and Alan Greenspan, who participated via videostream.
The activists were joined by Puerto Rican lawmaker Manuel Natal, who was in town to participate in a panel discussion hosted by City Council Speaker Melissa Mark-Viverito on Friday.
“They have two mechanisms under their authority to help Puerto Rico: one is to provide a bailout to Puerto Rico similar to the one they did to banks, the same banks that are now in Puerto Rico making a fortune out of our fiscal situation,” Natal said. “And the second would be to buy our debt” and charge Puerto Rico interest rates that are lower than the market would offer.
The activists claim that since the Fed had the authority to buy trillions of dollars of bad debt from Wall Street banks after the 2008 financial crisis, it can do the same for the debt of Puerto Rico. (read more)
[…] Today, TRS and the other main pension fund, the Employees Retirement System (ERS), together covering about 330,000 workers and retirees, are virtually penniless. Their combined unfunded liability totals $43.2 billion. With about $1.8 billion in assets to pay $45 billion in liabilities, the 96 percent combined shortfall is among the biggest of any U.S. state pension this century, and probably the biggest ever for pensions “of this size and scale,” said Keith Brainard, research director at the National Association of State Retirement Administrators. […] Last December, creditors griped privately when Puerto Rico doled out about $120 million of the bonuses even as it missed some minor bond payments. Christmas and medication bonuses, ad hoc cost-of-living adjustments, death benefits and other perks were expanded periodically throughout the 1980s, '90s and 2000s. These now account for nearly $3 billion in liabilities, according to Milliman's latest actuarial report, even after reductions under the 2013 reforms. Rafael Hernandez Colon, president of the Puerto Rico Senate during Ferre's administration, said their party went along with the Christmas bonuses “for political reasons” to avoid being labeled obstructionist, but did not consider it good governance. “We looked at it as giving candy to children,” Hernandez Colon said in an interview at their foundation in Ponce, a city on Puerto Rico's southern coast.
Here's a generally good outline detailing the historic problems that are systemic within the Puerto Rican financial problem. – SEE HERE –

GHC 6.12.1 in Debian Testing.
Joachim Breitner recently announced on the Debian Haskell mailing list that version 6.12.1 of the Glasgow/Glorious Haskell compiler was about to transition from Debian unstable to Debian testing. That has now happened. This means there is a very good chance it will be part of the next stable release of Debian.
A big thanks is due to Kari Pahula, the Debian maintainer for GHC who managed to get this version of GHC working on a bunch of CPU architectures not officially supported by the upstream GHC maintainers. Deserving of equal attention are Joachim Breitner and Marco T�lio Gontijo e Silva who did a large amount of real quality work to improve the way Haskell libraries are packaged in Debian.
The big change recently was drastic improvements in the way library dependencies are tracked across packages which will make it much easier to write tools to automatically check for broken dependency chains. Packaging Haskell libraries for Debian is now a relatively trivial and foolproof exercise. Packaging a library which is on Hackage can take as little as 5 minutes.
With the current version of GHC in Debian and a large and growing collection of Haskell libraries, writing Haskell code on Debian using nothing but Debian packages is now a pleasure. Ubuntu and other Debian and Ubuntu derived distributions of course also benefit from this work.

Democrats see an opportunity to capitalize on the massive backlash to the Federal Communications Commission's (FCC) decision to repeal its net neutrality rules.
The repeal sparked a massive outcry from internet users, spurred on by celebrities and activists who believe the move will allow internet providers like Comcast and Verizon to control consumers' internet experience.
The question is whether the outrage on Reddit forums can translate into votes for Democratic candidates next fall given the fact that younger people engaged on the issue are often the least reliable voters — particularly in midterm elections.
ADVERTISEMENT
Raffi Krikorian, the Democratic National Committee's (DNC) chief technology officer, said in an interview with The Hill that the massive outcry has been a subject of discussion among senior Democratic officials.
They said they didn't need to convince DNC officials of the weight that net neutrality might hold with voters.
And Democratic operatives say that while it's still early in the cycle, they see promise in how younger voters have been moved by the issue.
“Net Neutrality has the potential to motivate young and progressive voters to turn out, and we certainly welcome their support, as well as all privacy- and liberty-loving Americans who recognize that the Republican Party has abandoned these fundamental values,” Tyler Law, a spokesperson for the Democrats' House campaign wing said in a statement.
The FCC decision has sparked an effort among Democrats to enact legislation blocking the new FCC rules and leaving net neutrality in place. Republicans, who control both chambers, are countering with a bill that would partially reinstate the rules but allow internet service providers to charge websites for faster speeds and pre-empt the FCC and state authorities from passing stricter protections.
Neither bill is likely to become law, meaning the battle is probably going to move to the campaign season.
The FCC's rules, meanwhile, will be challenged in court, a process that could lead to a lengthy judicial battle.
The telecom industry is backing the drive for legislation to replace the FCC's rules, which broadband providers found too onerous. The industry believes it will be better off if it doesn't have to deal with the FCC changing the regulations every time the White House switches parties. And their goal is shared by most Republicans, who opposed the net neutrality rules backed by former President Obama as too heavy-handed. They say the rules have hampered innovation and investment from telecom providers.

But many Democrats are pushing the nuclear option, which would restore the rules by using a legislative tool called the Congressional Review Act (CRA) that allows Congress, with a simple majority in both chambers and the president's signature, to overturn regulatory moves.

Those bills face an uphill battle, but Democrats and activists can use the votes to hold Republicans' feet to the fire — and then as a campaign issue.
The pro-net neutrality group Fight for the Future, which helped rally internet users ahead of the FCC's vote, plans to track members' votes with a legislative scorecard and target those who don't try to save the rules.
Polls are bolstering Democratic hopes.
A recent poll out of the University of Maryland's Program for Public Consultation found that 83 percent of registered voters supported keeping the FCC's rules in place. That number included 75 percent of Republicans, 89 percent of Democrats and 86 percent of independents.
Steven Kull, a pollster who runs the university program, said that Republicans can usually count on support from their base for deregulatory moves, but that was negated by the popularity of the FCC rules.
“Basically, the public doesn't really buy the idea there's some gain for them in it,” Kull said in an interview with The Hill.
They believe that net neutrality could go hand in hand with the Democrats' message that the GOP has been giving handouts to the wealthy and powerful — something the party is going all-in on with its messaging on the tax bill signed into law by President Trump Donald John TrumpHouse committee believes it has evidence Trump requested putting ally in charge of Cohen probe: report Vietnamese airline takes steps to open flights to US on sidelines of Trump-Kim summit Manafort's attorneys say they should get less than 10 years in prison MORE on Friday.
“I think this will all flow rather easily into the narrative about the role of special interests,” they said.
Krikorian believes the issue will resonate with wide swaths of voters, whether they live in metropolitan areas and use the internet constantly for work, or if they're part of rural communities that have few, if any, choices when it comes telecom providers.
“I think you'll be hearing from Democrats in all of those different districts,” they said.
Climbing Crane With The King Of The Mountain
Jay Harrison lives at the base of Crane Mountain, but they probably spend more time on the mountain's many cliffs than in their house.
The guidebook Adirondack Rock devotes no less than seventy-three pages to the rock-climbing routes on Crane. This is thanks to Harrison, who has participated in about 350 first ascents in the Adirondacks—more than anyone else. Most of their routes are at Crane. They clearly are the king of the mountain.
In 2013, veteran climber Don Mellor wrote a profile of Harrison for the Explorer. It's well worth reading, both for Don's writing and for understanding who Jay Harrison is.
Last Sunday, Philip Brittan and I climbed at Crane for the first time, with Harrison as our guide.
Although Jay has been climbing at Crane since the early 1990s, they clearly are excited to show two newcomers around their favorite mountain.
They took us up a stellar “linkup”—a route that combines the best pitches of two or more routes.
First we ascended the first two pitches of Stairway to Heaven, both considered moderate in difficulty (5.7 on the Yosemite Decimal System scale). The highlight was pulling over a roof near the end of the second pitch. It proved to be easier than it looks, thanks to big handholds conveniently placed where you need them.
Of course, when Jay first climbed the pitch in 2010, they had no way of knowing those holds were there.
After the second pitch, we walked a short distance to Fireworks, another 5.7. This route has two cruxes: a hand-jam crack at the beginning and steep slab at the end. Jay and a friend put up this route on July Fourth in 2013.
We had lunch on the ledge above this pitch, then climbed Stand Your Ground, which Adirondack Rock describes as “one of the best 5.7 routes at Crane.” It follows a large crack, but with abundant holds on either side, the crack is seldom needed for holds. To my mind, the hardest part of the route is the steep slab above the crack.
Finally, we did Action Steps, a route just to the left of Stand Your Ground. It entails ascending a somewhat steep face, often on small holds. It's not in the book, but Jay rates it 5.8.
For the overall quality of the climbing, Adirondack Rock gives three stars (out of five) to Stairway to Heaven, two to Fireworks, and four to Stand Your Ground. Linking the three offers a variety of climbing on clean rock.
To learn more about Crane Mountain climbing and about Jay Harrison, I again encourage you to read Don Mellor's article. Or better yet, go climbing with Jay.  They are the owner of Mountainside Adventures.
SCP-3973
SCP-3973 in containment.
Item #: SCP-3973
Object Class: Safe
Special Containment Procedures: SCP-3973 is to be kept in a locked box and placed inside of a standard anomalous item locker in the Site-16 storage room. Testing is approved for and staff Level 2 or higher. Staff who wish to test SCP-3973 must make an entry in the log book located in the Site-16 storage room.
Following Interview 3973-1 and Dr. Harpy's request, SCP-3973's containment procedures are to be changed. SCP-3973 is to be kept in a locked 30x30x30 cm acrylic glass box in Site-16's Anomalous Item Research Lab 104. The scenery inside of the glass box should be changed once a month as an incentive for SCP-3973 to continue to comply with interviews. The scenery may be changed by adding more miniatures, plastic foliage, sand, or plastic rocks. These have been provided by Dr. Harpy and can be found in a labeled box in the Site-16 break room.
Staff who wish to test or interview SCP-3973 must have a security clearance of Level 2 or higher and receive permission from Dr. Harpy first.
Description: SCP-3973 is a standard miniature from the tabletop war game Warhammer 40,000 . The object is physically unremarkable, being composed of plastic and reaching a height of about 3.3 cm. SCP-3973 is covered in layers of ███████ brand model paint. The object's only apparent anomalous property is an influence over the outcome of dice rolls within a 50-cm radius caused by unknown means.
When it was originally contained, all dice rolled within a 50-cm radius of SCP-3973 always landed with the lowest side facing up. Due to this, SCP-3973 was originally classified as an anomalous item and denied full SCP classification. For a total of ██ months, SCP-3973 was kept in storage in one of Site-16's anomalous item lockers. During one of Site-16's routine anomalous item checks, Incident 3973-FC occurred. See below for details.
+ Incident 3973-FC - Incident 3973-FC The following is an excerpt from the log of Dr. Harpy. At the time, Dr. Harpy was preforming routine anomaly checks on multiple items from Site-16's Anomalous Items Department. Item Description: A tabletop war game miniature that influenced dice rolled within a 50-cm radius to land with the lowest side facing up.
Date of Recovery: 02/09/██
Location of Recovery: █████████, ██
Current Status: A standard anomalous item locker in Site-16. Testing materials: One U.S. quarter
One four-sided die
One six-sided die
One eight-sided die
One 10-sided die
One 12-sided die
One 20-sided die Test 1:
Procedure: One U.S. quarter is flipped within the item's area of effect.
Results: The quarter lands vertically on its side. Test repeated five times with the same results For brevity, tests two through six have been excluded. Procedure included rolling each die multiple times and each test resulted in the die landing with the "1" side facing up. Test 7:
Procedure: An impromptu test after accidentally knocking multiple dice into the object's area of effect. A total of six dice were rolled in the 50cm area.
Results: Dice landed in a pattern that resembled a "smiley face", with the six- and four-sided dice making two eyes and the rest forming a mouth. Test repeated a total of seven times, with the dice landing in the exact same formation each time. Requesting further research into the anomalous properties of this object.
+ Experiment Log 3973-1 - Experiment Log 3973-1 For brevity, the following excerpts are some of the more important findings from experiments with SCP-3973. Test 1:
Procedure: Asked for die to land on the "2" side.
Results: Die landed on the "2" side After several tests to confirm that the results were an anomalous effect, and not merely coincidence, Dr. Harpy suggested asking SCP-3973 if it was listening or could understand them, as it was able to give them the numbers they asked for. Test 14:
Procedure: Asked if SCP-3973 could understand what the doctors were saying, with the "2" side for yes and the "3" side for no.
Results: The die landed with the "2" side facing up.
Analysis: The possibility of sapience in SCP-3973 is considered. Test 15:
Procedure: Asked if SCP-3973 was aware of what was going on around it.
Results: The die landed with the "2" side facing up. Test 16:
Procedure: Asked if SCP-3973 had thoughts.
Results: The die landed with the "2" side facing up.
Note: In the ██ months that SCP-3973 as been in Foundation custody, it has been kept in a box in a locked anomalous item containment locker. Now we are faced with the possibility of sapience. -Dr. Harpy
Through testing, it was revealed that SCP-3973 exhibits signs of sapience. A communication system has been established with SCP-3973. The object must be placed on a surface that has a radius less than 50 cm. The interviewer can then roll a 20-sided and a 6-sided die. SCP-3973 will make the die show a number that lines up with a letter of the alphabet. If the letter is on a spot in the alphabet lower than 20, SCP-3973 will make the 6-sided die fall off of the table. All dice falling off of the table indicates a period.
+ Interview 3973-1 - Interview 3973-1 Interviewed: SCP-3973 Interviewer: Dr. Harpy Foreword: Dr. Harpy performed the interview with the asupervisorstioned dice-based communication system.
<Begin Log> Dr. Harpy: What is the first thing you can remember, SCP-3973? SCP-3973: WHERE IS COMMANDER Dr. Harpy: Commander? Can you elaborate? SCP-3973: COMMANDER TOOK ME AND SQUAD IN. PUT US TOGETHER. MADE US THE MEN WE ARE TODAY. Dr. Harpy: Others? There are more like you? SCP-3973: OTHERS BUT NOT LIKE ME. LOOK THE SAME BUT NO BRAINS. STILL NICE TO BE AROUND. Dr. Harpy: What is the last thing you can remember before being put into our custody? SCP-3973: COMMANDER WAS UPSET. NOT SURE WHY. WAS HELPING COMMANDER WIN BIG BATTLE. GIVING The HIGHEST ROLLS. PEOPLE SEEMED MAD AT COMMANDER. CALL THEM CHEATER. I THOUGHT I DID SOMETHING WRONG. DECIDED TO GIVE LOWEST INSTEAD OF HIGHEST FROM THEN ON. TOO LATE. COMMANDER LEFT US IN A DROP POD. Dr. Harpy: …I think I see. You've done well SCP-3973. Any closing remarks?
SCP-3973: THANK YOU FOR LISTENING SERGEANT
<End Log> Note: Following Interview 3973-1, I am formally requesting a change in the containment procedures for SCP-3973. I suggest moving the object to a glass box in an Anomalous Item Research Lab so it can see people more often as a "reward" for being compliant during interviews. - Dr. Harpy
Addendum: SCP-3973 was discovered at ████████, a war game tournament in the city of █████████, ██. A Foundation agent (Agent T████) who was attending that tournament on their personal time had heard rumors of a competitor (M████ C████) who had been accused of cheating at multiple tournaments. M████ C████ left all their figures behind in a box after getting banned for cheating at the tournament. Agent T████ took the box home to try to find out how the cheating had occurred. Shortly after, the anomalous property was discovered.
Several items were discovered in the box that SCP-3973 was found in, including:
Mac using Hatsune Miku fans must be sad.
A computer parts store in Tokyo's Chiyoda Ward currently has on display a custom PC featuring a computer tower that makes it look like the virtual pop idol Hatsune Miku is dancing inside it.
The unique computer was created by a team of two, which included the popular PC modder Monma Fabio. It was originally unveiled an Osaka PC builders meet-up in June and is now on display for a limited time at Oriospec, a PC parts store in Tokyo.
In order to get the effect of the Vocaloid idol looking like she's dancing inside the computer the creators of this PC play a video of Hatsune Miku performing on a modified LCD screen that is installed in the left side panel of the tower. Additionally, the creators also modified the inside of the PC in order to make it look like a stage.
Although the LCD screen installed in the PC can be used to display anything, the white background and modified interior make it a bit difficult to use for anything other than as a ‘stage' for virtual pop idols.
Currently, there are no plans to sell this PC or produce it in mass quantities.

Get ready for a new otter at the Seattle Aquarium this weekend.
Mishka, a 6-month-old Alaskan sea otter, will arrive early Saturday morning and should be available for viewing on Sunday, according to a news release from the aquarium.
Mishka, Russian for “little bear,” is coming to Seattle from the Alaska SeaLife Center in Seward, Alaska. They were rescued after being caught in a fishing net last summer, rehabilitated at the Alaska SeaLife Center and was deemed non-releasable by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.
Mishka has been living indoors in Alaska, so the aquarium staff will need to systematically acclimate them to their new outdoor environment.
The Alaska SeaLife Center and Seattle Aquarium are working collaboratively to place sea otters that have been deemed non-releasable by the USFWS, the aquarium said.
With their bizarro news network, Aaron Sorkin thinks they are reimagining TV news, but they are only reminiscing, wishing for the return of the mythical Uncle Walter who'll tell us all what's what. Truth is, the process we saw at work in the premier of The Newsroom — operating without a net of knowledge, ad libbing while staying one step ahead of what's known — was precisely the prescription for what CNN and Fox did only a few days later, screwing up the announcement of the Supreme Court's Obamacare decision because they knew too little and said too much too soon.
Let's not rely on Sorkin to reinvent TV news. But let's reinvent it, please. Because TV news does suck in so many ways: repeating what we already know; standing on its silly orthodoxies (the stand-up “report” in front of a location where nothing has happened in 12 hours); happy talk and those silly verbal fillips during handovers that add no information or value (“…a very troubling report this evening”); weather über alles; fluff from flacks; FIRE! and crime; militant banality; and most important, virtually no original reporting and even less investigation.
But I don't want to act like a print snob, because print's dying and TV's not. And I don't want to be an internet snob, because my real fear is that internet news is becoming all too much like TV news, making easy and obvious use of technologies instead of adding true value to the flow of information: blog posts that repeat and rewrite when a link to the source would better serve the public and journalists who do the real reporting; comment for the sake of comment; slideshows for the sake of slideshows (and pageviews); glomming onto the latest cool thing (TV has helicopters; we have aggregation, Wordles, Twitter feeds, infographics that spend an acre to say what a paragraph could, exercises in dataviz that all look like the same supernova, and — God help us — videos made to mimic TV news … NO!).
I have been arguing here that we need to reinvent news — its forms, relationships, and business models — given the new opportunities that technology provides. But I don't want us to fall into the shiny-thing trap of TV or the priesthood of the broadcaster. I want to reimagine the possibilities and the value of news. One challenge is that we don't yet know what the internet is and what all it can and will do. But we do know what TV is and can do. And we know that TV news makes sad use of its opportunities. So how do we reinvent it? I'd like your thoughts. Here are some of mine:
* Go ahead: summarize. We know that TV is good at repeating the news, so why not start by doing that better and more efficiently? Don't waste money and journalistic “talent” on stand-ups before long-dormant crime scenes. Don't assume you need one person to read the news and another the sports when it's all just reading. One person reading in a studio can tell us most everything that the current crew does. The next question is how that one person's script could add value: by summarizing stories cogently and precisely; by adding context; by cramming lots of information into our busy hour; by taking the effort to find the very best reports out there and curating and integrating them. Make those 22 minutes truly worthwhile. There's nothing to stop one or a few smart people from making this newscast now. But it doesn't really push the peanut down the road, it only makes better peanut butter.
* Explain. Open secret: The great strength of public radio in the U.S. isn't so much reporting or investigation but explanation. Take Adam Davidson & Co.'s brilliant work at Planet Money and on This American Life teaching us about economics. Now imagine they had visuals in front of them, even just a whiteboard to diagram the flow of money, a la the Khan Academy. Imagine having experts on-call with webcams to untie particular knots. Video is an excellent medium for explanation; that's why it is being used for education. Sadly, public television has not taken up the opportunity to create a show that explains the news. Neither has cable news. Instead of a screwed-up newsflash over the Supreme Court's ACA ruling, how much better it would be to have a real explanation of the impact of the legislation and how it will work (as Reddit did). It's an opportunity out there for the taking.
* Convene. So long as TV is still a mass medium, much of its power lies in gathering and organizing people or action. The Tea Party is the proof of that. Why not use this power for good? Oh, I know, that's advocacy; it violates the Star Trek Prime Directive against interfering with the populous. To hell with that. TV could bring people together not to shout at each other but to find common ground and action. Jon Stewart, again, tried to do that with their Rally to Restore Sanity.
Sadly, it didn't accomplish much; sanity has not been restored. Perhaps the goal was just too ambitious. Could local TV convene people to clean up a park or tutor kids or start a FOIA club. Can we start there?
* Create. CNN and much of mainstream media blew it because they thought cameras in the hands of the public were an opportunity to give them free content, rather than to empower that public. Al Gore's Current blew it (long before it hired Keith Olbermann). It had the chance to be an open platform for the creation and distribution of vox vid by millions. I even had this argument with Gore's cofounder: open up and make this the first truly network of the net. But they were tradition- and revenue-bound, favoring instead the cable companies and their demands. Current could have been YouTube. It's now a has-been. Perhaps Cory Booker's #waywire will see a new opportunity, which I think is to add value to the public's video by finding the best, making it better, adding context, and so on.
Video will soon be coming from everywhere. Imagine a street scene in which, say, a tenth, even a hundredth of the people are wearing Google Glass, constantly and instantly able to capture and share what they see (the other 99 percent will have “phones” able to do the same): thousands, millions of cameras in a city. What should TV news look like then? The key skill is no longer sending out a crew; it's finding people near news or finding news from the people who are sharing it — in other words, asking and listening.
* Discuss. Charlie Rose is wonderful but they don't scale. Online comments are in theory wonderful but they still tend to bring out the worst. TV could find a middle ground, opening up the dialog beyond the booked-and-flacked guest on a show while also giving some form, structure, and civility to the conversation. See what local TV news anchor Sarah Hill is doing using Google+ Hangouts to open up TV. A decade ago, I envisioned a show or network that would rely on the then-new network of webcams growing to bring new expertise and new voices to TV. Now it exists. Use it.
Imagine, too, how TV could make better use of the back-channel discussion that is already occurring around it on Twitter, on Facebook, and on Google+. Reading the random tweet on air doesn't cut it. How could TV use these feeds to inform questions and answer them, to gauge reaction, to fact-check, and more?
Note that these notions — making TV a device for creation and conversation — transform TV from a one-way medium into a two-way platform. That's where it should head, because it finally can.
* Joke. There's a lot to be learned from the success of Jon Stewart and Stephen Colbert. I want to teach a journalism course in humor and truth. Humor is a perfect way to call bullshit, which should be the mission of every news organization there is (instead, it's the motto of Howard Stern's Howard 100 News: “No more bullshit!”). Humor punctures pomposity. It engages the public. It adds perspective. TV does humor well.
* Fact-check. Want to add value to the flow of news? Fact-check it. Add annotations to video from sources.
* Share. It has been argued that the BBC and other state-owned TV networks should make all the video they shoot available for remixing by the public since, after all, the public already paid for it. It's a good idea. Take all that a network shoots plus all that C-SPAN captures and create tools to let the public make their own shows around it, finding the gems that wouldn't fit in 1:30 on the air, making TV from a mass medium into a far more targeted venue.
* Report. Oh, yes, there's no better way to add value than to report. There's nothing stopping TV from reporting. Yes, sometimes, cameras get in the way, but sometimes they also make it possible to get more information because they can show instead of just tell and because, as The Daily Show proves regularly, people will do anything to be on TV, even make fools of themselves. Besides, cameras are getting so small we're wearing them, losing their power of intimidation.
I'll be the first to say (so you don't need to) that that's a crappy, incomplete list, not nearly imaginative enough. So beat me. Inspire us. Reimagine the possibilities. Remake TV. Just please don't make it this:
A 21-year-old man was struck and killed by a CTA Brown Line train Monday evening on the Northwest Side, authorities said.
The man was struck around 9:45 p.m. near the Kedzie stop in the 4600 block of North Kedzie Avenue, according to police and CTA spokesperson Jeff Tolman. Trains run at street level along that stretch.
The man was pronounced dead on the scene, police and Chicago Fire Department spokesperson Jeff Lyle said. A Chicago police spokesperson said the department was conducting a death investigation.
Abdallah Alhameedi, 20, said they were smoking a cigarette near Salam Restaurant, where he's a busboy, just south of the Kedzie stop when they saw two men fighting.
One man threw a can of beer at the other, and both started running north toward the crossing on Kedzie, Alhameedi said. Moments later, Alhameedi said they noticed a train stop and saw one of the men crying nearby.
J.J. Painter, 28, who lives nearby, said they have noticed people running across the tracks when the trains are close to the station.
“A lot of people will rush to get to their train, getting pretty close,” Painter said. “I've done it myself. ... It's not smart.”
Workers at Allstate Power Vac, a Key ConEd Contractor, Vote to Strike After Lack of Progress in Negotiations
(Brooklyn, N.Y.) –– Workers at Allstate Power Vac – a Con Edison contractor – announced today that they have voted unanimously to authorize a strike, as negotiations drag into their seventh month without progress toward a first contract. These workers are on the front lines of Con Edison's work across the city, cleaning and vacuuming underground electrical infrastructure so that Con Edison employees can maintain power lines and transformers. A strike would stop many projects.
“It is unacceptable that workers are risking their lives and maintaining this essential infrastructure for near minimum wage salaries,” said Sean Campbell, President of Teamsters Local 813, which Allstate Power Vac workers voted to join in November 2015. “Allstate Power Vac and Con Edison are not taking these workers demands for fair pay and respect seriously. A strike is always a last resort, but we are ready to walk out if these workers do not get a fair contact and the respect they deserve.”
Workers also attended Con Edison's annual shareholder meeting this week, delivered a petition to the Con Edison board of directors, and called on the utility to intercede with Allstate on their behalf. Con Edison workers who do the same work as Allstate Power Vac employees get paid far higher wages and have additional safety protections.
“It says ‘Allstate Power Vac' on our paychecks, but we know that ConEd would not be able to operate without our work,” said Reginald Riddick, one of the 60 workers at Allstate Power Vac. “The time for patience is over. Allstate Power Vac has committed unfair labor practices and ConEd has turned a blind eye. These companies need to respect the workers on the front lines and give all utility workers a fair wage.”
Allstate Power Vac starts new workers at close to the minimum wage ($12-$13/hour) and the company endangers temp workers by putting them on the job untrained – one suffered a bad electrocution. Employees fear being disciplined if they try to refuse unsafe work.
The union filed three unfair labor practice charges against the company. The charges, which are currently before the National Labor Relations Board, include bargaining in bad faith and demoting a worker for supporting the union.
No date has been set for the potential strike. The unanimous strike authorization vote gives union leadership the power to stop work at a moment's notice.
Last week Allstate workers showed that they are ready, picketing the contractor's Brooklyn office with signs reading “Practice Strike.”

ANKARA (Reuters) - Turkish Prime Minister Tayyip Erdoğan said on Tuesday local elections had given them a mandate to “liquidate” the enemies they see as contriving a corruption scandal and would go after their international activities and sources of funding.

In their first parliamentary speech since their ruling AK Party dominated March 30 municipal polls, Erdoğan said “traitors” responsible for a stream of graft allegations and the illegal tapping of thousands of phones would be brought to account.
Erdoğan accuses Islamic cleric Fethullah Gulen, a former ally now based in the United States, of orchestrating the graft scandal to undermine him. Gulen's Hizmet network claims millions of followers and holds influence in the police and judiciary.
Erdoğan has accused the movement of running a “parallel state”, spying on thousands of government officials over years and leaking manipulated recordings in a bid to unseat them ahead of last month's elections.
“March 30 is the day when the page was turned on tutelage, when the monuments of hubris were felled, and the privileges (of an elite) were lost forever,” Erdoğan said.
“The nation gave us a mandate for the liquidation of the parallel state. We will not have the slightest hesitation. We shall never forget the betrayal,” they said.
They said the government would follow up on what they called the network's international links and investigate all “illegally collected monies and donations”.
The movement, also known as Cemaat (JEH-maat), “The Community”, has for decades been a spearhead of Turkish cultural influence and commerce overseas, especially in the assertive moves into Africa, the Middle East and Asia in the years after the AK Party took power in 2002.
Cemaat says the Turkish government is already putting pressure on governments to close down its global network of schools which have been a major source of influence and revenue. Government officials say Turkish embassies have stopped backing schools and business linked to Gulen.
Hizmet denies using followers in the police and judiciary to launch a graft inquiry targeting Erdoğan family members, ministers and business people, or any involvement in the illicit recording of top officials.
Erdoğan's Islamist-rooted AK Party relied on Hizmet to break the grip on politics of the army, which carried out three coups between 1960 and 1980 and forced an Islamist-led government from power in 1997. But they now cast the fight with Hizmet as a continuation of that struggle against tutelage in any form, the final chapter in a battle for democracy and justice.
“They will answer before the courts. But not in front of their parallel courts; they will answer before the court of the nation,” Erdoğan said.
PRESIDENTIAL AMBITION
Erdoğan has made little secret of their ambition to take up a powerful presidency, but such is their determination to finish the battle with Gulen that it remains unclear whether they will run in the first direct elections for the post in August.
 They are barred by AK Party rules from standing for a fourth term as prime minister, currently a more powerful role than the largely ceremonial presidency; but the party could amend those rules with relative ease if it feels their leadership is needed to see out the feud with Gulen, senior officials have said.
Erdoğan would seek to shape the presidency as a more powerful role than that played by incumbent Abdullah Gul. Erdoğan was quoted on Tuesday as saying the direct election of the next president would automatically bestow the role with greater powers.
“The responsibilities will be different after these elections. It will not be a president of protocol, but one that sweats, runs around, works hard,” they were quoted as saying by the pro-government Sabah newspaper.
Until now, Turkey's parliament has elected the head of state. Gul is a close Erdoğan ally and co-founder of the AK Party, tipped as a possible prime minister if Erdoğan were to run for what they would shape as the top job.
Erdoğan had long wanted to change the constitution and create an executive presidency, but political opposition to such a move has checked those plans for now.
There are also some doubts that Erdoğan, for all their popularity among conservative AK Party voters, could win the 50 percent plus they would need in a second round as they are a divisive figure who would struggle to pick up opposition support.
Erdoğan's opponents fear that their election to the presidency could exacerbate what they see as their authoritarian tendencies.
The government has already dismissed or reassigned thousands of police officers and tightened control over the Internet and judiciary in response to the corruption scandal.
It also blocked access to Twitter and YouTube after audio recordings, purportedly showing corruption in Erdoğan's inner circle, were leaked on social media. Reuters has not been able to verify their authenticity.
The block on Twitter was lifted after the constitutional court ruled that it breached freedom of expression - a decision Erdoğan said on Tuesday was wrong and should be overturned - while YouTube still remains largely blocked.

One of the most compelling aspects of studying history are the “what-ifs” of our past. In our personal lives “what-ifs” can drive us mad — “What if I?” “Why didn't she? If only he” — but in the abstract “what-ifs” make for enjoyable party talk. Since I don't go to parties (I have children) I'll share some with you now.
For instance, much of what we now call the Iron Range could have very easily ended up in Canada. Had the British fully understood the value of the ore here, that certainly would have been the case. Furthermore, Minnesota could have been two states instead of one, a north and south that included parts of the Dakotas in each. Additional scenarios allow for a State of Superior that would have included the Lake Superior-adjacent lands of Minnesota, Wisconsin and Michigan.
None of these things actually happened, though, and the conditions that allowed for these possibilities shall not return; at least, not in our corner of the Multiverse. So what should we make of a giant domed city in Northern Minnesota's Aitkin County that almost was? Surely THAT must be an impossibility?
In 1973, planners had secured funds to explore the concept of a self-sustaining, contained city that recycled its waste and conserved both its resources and costs. Through the fate of geography and opportunity, a site in the back woods location of Swatara, Minnesota, was selected for the experimental metropolis.
The brainchild of famed 1960s futurist Dr. Athelstan Spilhaus, the Minnesota Experimental City would have housed 250,000 residents. The dome would have provided an energy-efficient way to maintain a comfortable year-round temperature throughout the whole city. Waste would have been recycled; food grown and raised right there under the dome. There would no cars in the city. Rather, people would park at the edge of the dome and use electric trolleys and conveyance methods that connected all locations within the dome.
Designed to harness the economic and inventive power of computers and new technology, the city was to be a knowledge center not unlike Silicon Valley. Monorails would travel above ground, while ground level was for walking and biking only. The city was also going to be a proving ground for a theoretical educational model that would have eschewed traditional schools for person-to-person lifelong community learning.
As fanciful as it sounds, the idea became a very real consideration before the state legislature in 1973. But the powers that be blinked; various local concerns balked, and the city that so very much reminds me of the “Dharma Initiative” in the fictional TV show “Lost” never was.
A 1987 story in the Chicago Tribune revisited the Minnesota Experimental City, suggesting that then-Gov. Rudy Perpich was interested in reviving the idea. But Gov. Perpich — a man who loved big ideas — didn't see this one through. More likely it simply didn't have the support, since much of the area was in a local recession at the time.
(As an interesting aside, in that '87 stories a Swatara man is quoted saying “You can`t stop progress. But they did.” That's a succinct sentiment that has proven all too apt at times in the region's history).
No, the Minnesota Experimental City did not happen. Like the State of Superior or retroactive Canadian citizenship for the residents of Hibbing, it's just not going to happen as planned. But a domed city, designed to save costs, energy and create more workable, walkable communities? That's more possible, even if we'll likely have to see a lot more plagues and locusts to get the legislature to act on it.

Wesley Sneijder's off-field behaviour was questioned; Mesut Ozil was always out partying until late; Arjen Robben was forever injured; and Angel Di Maria was greedy. They were all greedy, in fact. Greedy and often ill-advised. None of them cared about Real Madrid, and they didn't respect Madrid, either. The Santiago Bernabeu was a better place without them, and besides, they'd left because they wanted to, not because anyone had encouraged them to go, still less pushed them out. Or so the stories went.
The players said differently. "Wesley has no intention of leaving Real Madrid," Sneijder's agent announced during their final days at the club in 2009. "I didn't want to go," Robben admitted in the same year. "I was certain I was staying at Madrid, but then I realised I didn't have the faith of the coach, of the bosses," Ozil insisted four years later. "It was never my desire to leave," Di Maria claimed last year once they had gone. Robben complained of "lots of lies," and Di Maria noted, bitterly, "I wasn't to someone's footballing taste."
This week, as the story broke of Manchester United's interest in signing Sergio Ramos and their desire to depart, the newspaper La Razon ran a front page with a picture of the defender celebrating a goal. "Respect the shirt!" the headline demanded. An editorial accused them and their brother and agent, Rene of hawking themselves around Europe "for a few euros," a money-grabber whose commitment to the cause was in question. They are, they said, a player who didn't even have any real offers from anywhere -- actually, they did -- but still sought to hold their club to ransom.
Sergio Ramos' Real Madrid future is in doubt, and now sides are being taken.
It was a blunter, more open version of a narrative line followed for some time in certain, familiar sections of the media. Ramos read it and believed that they knew what, or who, lay beneath, suspecting that lines of communication would lead back to the Bernabeu. The author of the editorial is close to Madrid president Florentino Perez, and their editorial line is as clear as it is relentless. The club suspect that Ramos has (also) used the press to strengthen their position, with their version of events expressed in papers critical of Real's upper echelons. Much of the media line up in trenches, playing their part. This is a battle in which sides have been taken and the front line is drawn in a predictable place. That alone affects how things go.
Speaking on Radio Marca, former footballer Pedro Riesco, now an agent close to Rene Ramos, said: "At the moment, with everything that is happening, it is hard to see Sergio Ramos staying at Madrid. Sergio is a symbol of the club and has nothing to prove [in terms of commitment] to anyone, but so much that is being said [against him] is manipulation, an attempt to discredit them by the de facto spokespersons who act like puppets saying that Sergio does not respect the badge, that they are a money-grabber..."
The mutual distrust does not make reconciliation impossible, but it does make it more difficult. A mental image keeps popping into the mind: Perez apologetically holding a bunch of flowers hurriedly bought at a late-night petrol station. The way this will end remains uncertain. It is hard to judge what Ramos would do if -- and it is a gigantic and improbable if -- Madrid suddenly offered them an enormous contract, closer to the €10 million a year that media reports say they want.
The damage done is significant, and much of it is irreversible. Equally, to judge this as simply a means of getting a new contract out of Madrid is wrong; it has gone well beyond that, and Ramos' desire to move is real. It is equally impossible to know what would happen if Madrid refuse to sell except that, in theory, Manchester United would also refuse to sell David De Gea.
What is clear is that this battle will be partly played out in public and is one that might well get nasty. It already has, in fact, and the anger is real; the tension, too. Price matters. So do personalities, and so do power and popularity. That means that propaganda also matters. More importantly, the point is that the story repeats itself: the origins are familiar and some of the tactics are too. We have been here before. This is not just Ramos; the parallels with other players and the reaction to them are striking.
When players leave Madrid, there might be the standard statement expressing gratitude for their services and wishing them all the best for the future, but the real sentiment and the real substance usually lies elsewhere. Those who depart Real Madrid are rarely celebrated or afforded a fond farewell. It is rare even for their passing to be seen as simply the normal consequence of life in football; instead, it is as if it needs to be justified somehow, as if someone has to be to "blamed." It is as if it is necessary that not only have they gone, or are about to go, but they are somehow guilty, too.
When the character assassinations begin, and whether they are cause or consequence of the departure, is open to debate. But there is certainly self-interest at play and the idea that these attacks are cynical and sought; they serve a purpose. Players who grow powerful are particularly mistrusted at the boardroom level; equally, that very power requires the club to act with care and cleverness. Cunning, in fact.
Of course, few of the attacks or counterattacks are open. Nothing has been said by Madrid or Ramos, for example; a door is always left ajar, the opportunity to deny and wash hands clean. Instead, they have come from those unofficial de facto spokespersons on both sides that Riesco talked about.
When Real Madrid sold Claude Makelele in 2003, Perez was quoted in France Football as saying that they were "no good in the air" and rarely gave a pass "more than three metres." "We won't miss him," the president added. Madrid subsequently began a three year trophyless run, their longest in half a century, while Makelele joined Chelsea and won two Premier League titles, two League Cups and the FA Cup. In their second season, Jose Mourinho called Makelele the club's player of the year. They were also included in the 2005 FIFPro XI. Perez learned not to speak out in those terms again and certainly not to make a purely footballing judgment that could rebound against him. But the justifications continued.
Arjen Robben and Wesley Sneijder found great success after being shown the door by Real Madrid.
When Perez returned as president in 2009, Sneijder and Robben were shown the door to fund a new project, led by Cristiano Ronaldo -- a signing already secured by outgoing president Ramon Calderon -- and Kaka. Some were not happy, and manager Manuel Pellegrini, soon the victim of a campaign against them that they suspected came from within, later admitted that they had not wanted to sell either player. Nonetheless, the headline on the front of Marca on the day they left ran: "Well sold." Yet at the end of the season, which Madrid finished empty-handed, Robben and Sneijder faced each other in the European Cup final, each hoping to finish as a treble winner. Robben's Bayern won the double; Sneijder's Inter won the treble. Their Holland reached a World Cup final. Arsene Wenger joked that it would be a good idea to hang around at the Bernabeu and pick up players dumped by Madrid.
Opportunistic? Yes, of course. And some of the criticism was unfair and aggressive, too. It is also undoubtedly true that the media have on occasion unjustly attacked the club, president and players while defending others come what may. Just ask Mourinho. But it also helps to explain in part the pressure, the politics and the propaganda, the machinations, some of which are barely even hidden, and the way that departing players have not been allowed to just leave with a deal done or a hand shaken. It also sheds light on why others felt "invited" to leave. Gonzalo Higuain, for example. "There was a campaign against me," they said, not entirely without justification.
Fans chanted "don't sell Ozil" at Gareth Bale's presentation, although that particular swap proved Perez as right as others proved them wrong: Ozil struggled in England, and Bale won the Champions League. Di Maria didn't exactly improve at Manchester United after having won the European Cup for Madrid, although Madrid won nothing without him. But rather than taking that as a sign that sometimes you get it right and sometimes you don't, those sales still had to be justified, and lessons learned for future sales, too. So, players set to depart or players the club wanted to depart -- problem players or those getting too powerful or asking too much -- found themselves under attack, sometimes in a way that was personal and unpleasant, with columnists and pundits wading in: this guy's not professional, this guy doesn't sleep, he's out until all hours. It did not matter that it was not true.
On one level, fans are at the centre of all these actions. Often player and club are actually after the same thing -- the sale -- but they do not want to be seen to be the one pushing for it. No one wants to be the bad guy, judged for it or held to account. There is a reason one side seeks to portray Ramos as not truly a Madridista and a reason they and other players seek to portray themselves as exactly that. There is a reason clubs insist on the buy-out clause: not only is it a lot of money but it is also the perfect excuse -- "there was nothing we could do." Fans are judge and jury, so they are given a story. Sometimes it is true, sometimes it is not. Even if the information is correct, the interpretation might not be. One man's telling of the truth is another man's cynical leak.
Contract negotiations are often the detonator. Players have a habit of talking about faith and affection when they are really talking about money, although the salary is always symbolic as well as financial. At the same time, the player who asks too much or investigates their potential options elsewhere is rarely portrayed simply as a professional negotiating a better deal and seeking the best for himself. There is a kind of "how dare he?" feel about it, and they become a mercenary. There can be no easier accusation to throw. Certainly none fits the fans' mindset better and few sticks better. When has a player ever "requested" a salary? They always "demands" one. It's all about money, critics say.
Real Madrid president Florentino Perez has overseen the departure of many big-name players from the Bernabeu.
The ill-advised player is another easy narrative: Ozil has been poorly advised by their dad, it was said. Many of the attacks on Ramos this week have been levelled at their brother.
Makelele wanted a new contract, Di Maria wanted a new contract and Ramos wanted a new contract. Soon the figures emerged, figures that normal people can barely imagine and clubs do not want to pay if they can avoid it. The players are immediately called money-grabbers. Meanwhile, they might have taken it to be symbolic of some deeper rejection instead of just a business decision. The accusations that quickly emerged (and where they emerged) helped convince them that there was more to this than just a salary issue.
Ozil wanted a €2 million rise. When Di Maria left, Perez said that the Argentine had demanded to be the club's highest earner after Ronaldo and that Madrid had signed James only after they knew that Di Maria was going. Soon after arriving in Manchester, Di Maria wrote a letter saying that was not true and that, as far as the timing was concerned, the opposite was the case: James did not come because they went, rather they went because they knew James was coming. As hints go, it was not a subtle one. Di Maria also said Madrid had sent them a letter telling them not to play in the World Cup final. They tore it up on the morning of the game.
Now the stories say that Ramos wants €10 million, more than anyone except Ronaldo and Bale. It might be true, but where do the figures come from? Where, counter the clubs, do the stories of interest from other big clubs come from, with their implicit threat?
Last week, Barcelona presidential candidate Jordi Majo said that they had been offered Ramos. However, they admitted, the offer had come neither from Ramos nor from their agent, who told the media that it is entirely untrue. So, if it is untrue, where had it come from? And why? What purpose does it serve, if any? You can be drinking, out on the town, injured or greedy. But flirting with Barcelona is the worst crime of all.
And so if Ramos does go, it becomes easier to swallow and easier to sell, explained away. It will be nobody's fault but his. Real Madrid, they will say, will not so much have lost a great player, vice captain, winner of the decima and a man who has given 10 years' service. No, they will have lost an ungrateful money-grabber, an anti-madridista with so little respect for the fans that they offered themselves to their greatest rival.

It's always good to see Frédéric Bastiat discussed outside of libertarian circles, because even when their views are misstated, the mere mention of their name might prompt curious readers to check them out for themselves. That can't hurt!
So thank you, Matthew Yglesias, who wrote last week in Slate:
Bastiat's alleged broken windows fallacy involves simply assuming that there's no such thing as genuinely idle resources or an “output gap.” In that context, yes, it's a vibrant intuitive depiction of crowding out. But this doesn't counter any Keynesian or monetarist points about the viability of stimulus during a recession induced by nominal shocks, it involves assuming that no such recessions can occur even though they plainly do. In defense of Bastiat, at the time they were writing the modern industrial business cycle was a very new thing and the vast majority of economic ups and downs were caused by things like bad weather which—as you can see in the corn futures market today—is indeed a decisive consideration in an agricultural economy. But that's no excuse for people sitting around in 2012 to be pounding the table with an old book that's non-responsive to modern issues professing to be baffled why people don't find it more persuasive. [Emphasis in original.]
Yglesias asserts that Bastiat merely made certain assumptions about the operation of markets, but Yglesias does not demonstrate that this is the case—and couldn't. Was Bastiat unfamiliar with J. B. Say? Lord Keynes and their fans may think they refuted Say's Law of Markets, but, tellingly, they had to misstate the law first. It's not that “supply creates its own demand,” but rather that supply is demand. One produces a good either to consume it oneself or, more commonly, to trade it for another good. Demand and supply are two sides of the same, well, coin—which reminds me to add that Say's Law holds not just in a barter economy but a monetary one also—a freed one, that is, unlike the corporate state we all occupy.
Time Structure
True, someone might sell a good and not spend the money received. But this would lead to idleness only if the economy did not consist in a time structure of production coordinated by interest rates. In other words, money not spent is saved and available for investment (that is, payments for producer goods and labor, which will be spent on consumer goods) at stages remote from the consumer-goods level; that is, long-term investment in production for future consumption. (As Austrian macroeconomist Roger Garrison says, people save for something.)
Given our insatiable demand for goods, in a freed market a general glut couldn't happen; if prices were free to fluctuate in response to changed conditions or entrepreneurial error, the price of goods plentiful relative to demand would fall, while the price of goods deficient relative to demand would rise. Entrepreneurs would then adjust their plans, but since change is the rule, the market would never reach a state of rest. Say's Law is about a (free) process through time, not general equilibrium.
Can Yglesias really be serious when they write that Bastiat's position “involves assuming that no such recessions can occur even though they plainly do”? It is Yglesias who assumes what must be proved: namely, that the business cycle is a natural feature of the free market, rather than the consequence of government's corporatist meddling with money, banking, and interest rates.
Vulgar Liberalism
Yglesias furnishes the latest example of “vulgar liberalism,” as Kevin Carson calls it. This is the attribution of the evils of corporatism—big-business power, recessions, long-term structural unemployment, exploitation of labor, and more—to its antithesis, the freed market. Keynesians look around, see unemployment and idle resources, and conclude (often encouraged by libertarians) that since the “free market” let this happen and doesn't seem to be doing anything about it, government stimulus is in order.
That's like walking into a movie in the middle, thinking you understand the plot. There are certainly idle labor and idle resources today. But that mere observation says nothing about why they are idle. Ludwig von Mises and F. A. Hayek, bolstered by the anatomists of corporatism, provided an explanation. Critics are welcome to rebut it, but they shouldn't pretend it doesn't exist.
Business Cycle
As the Austrian economists explain, central-bank inflationary policies that artificially depress interest rates encourage longer-term production activities that wouldn't have been undertaken otherwise, given the level of real saving. When the boom ends, the malinvestment of labor and resources is revealed. Labor, equipment, and land that had been attracted to production inconsistent with true consumer demand must now be rearranged. The misshapen economy must be permitted to assume a more appropriate shape. But that takes entrepreneurial risk, time, and money (savings). If the correction is to occur quickly and with minimum hardship, the government must get out of the way. In particular, it must not keep interest rates artificially low (discouraging saving) or create uncertainty about the future regulatory and tax regimes. The world is uncertain enough; to the extent government increases uncertainty about regulation and taxation, investors will be encouraged to run in place and not make grand new commitments. This prevents the needed effort to align labor and resources with what consumers want (or will want in the future).
Government spending may stimulate the use idle resources, but that's not good enough. We don't want just any use of recourses—they're scarce, after all. We want uses that consumers would approve of. Politicians, whose decisions face no market test, are clueless in that regard.
So, contra Yglesias, when a fan of Bastiat's sees the broken-window fallacy in government “stimulus” spending, they are on the firmest of ground. Every dime the government spends—whether acquired through taxation or borrowing—is a dime that someone in the private economy won't be spending. If people are not spending already—which is not the case these days—we must look to the earlier government interventions that brought about that condition—and then repeal those anti-market corporatist policies, regulations, and taxes.

Returned today from the CinemaCon confab, so I'm just now getting a chance to catch up with Charter Communications‘ astonishing SEC filing that urges Time Warner Cable shareholders to support its $37B cash-and-stock bid over Comcast's $45.2B all-stock offer. I don't know if there's enough in the proxy to derail the Comcast-TWC deal. But it's sure to create some turbulence — if nothing else by giving ammo to class action lawyers who want to argue that the TWC board failed to faithfully represent shareholders' interests when it stiff-armed Charter and embraced Comcast.
Related: Fears Of Government Rejection Hung Over Comcast's Deal Talks With Time Warner Cable: Proxy
Charter says that TWC shareholders should reject the Comcast proposal because it faces a “high degree of regulatory risk.” If Comcast prevails, it would have “nearly 40 percent of the broadband market, around 33 million TV subscribers and a major programmer in NBC Universal. … [I]t is difficult to imagine a transaction that could concentrate the industry more than the Proposed Comcast Merger.” There's also a danger that the approval process will run past mid-2015, potentially making it hard for TWC to make decisions while it “inevitably suffer[s] disruption.” Charter charged that the TWC board refused to “meaningfully engage” with its CEO Tom Rutledge, and then — in the Comcast deal — “agreed to limit its own ability to consider any competing bid or to provide bidders with the due diligence that would be valuable to provide a competitive bid.” To make matters worse, Charter says that the value of Comcast's offer has diminished as its stock price has fallen. It's now worth about $141.16 per TWC share instead of $158.82, which seems to belie TWC's position that Charter's offer was inadequate because the No. 2 cable company “would not take a penny less than $160.”

Charter also sided with activist investors who object when companies have special super voting shares that give insiders outsized power. In the case of Comcast, the family of CEO Brian Roberts controls 33.3% of the votes “even though those shares would represent less than 0.3% of the economic value of all shares of Comcast. … This would result in what we believe is a negative impact on Comcast's corporate governance, to the detriment of the holders of Class A shares” which would include TWC investors. The bottom line, Charter says, is that a “no” vote on the Comcast deal “will send a message that you want the management to represent your interest and maximize your investment.”

TWC says it remains “fully committed to our merger with Comcast, which we believe is in the best interests of shareholders.”

An oneirogen, from the Greek ὄνειρος óneiros meaning " dream" and gen "to create", is that which produces or enhances dream-like states of consciousness. This is characterized by an immersive dream state similar to REM sleep, which can range from realistic to alien or abstract. Many dream-enhancing plants such as dream herb ( Calea zacatechichi) and African dream herb ( Entada rheedii), as well as the hallucinogenic diviner's sage ( Salvia divinorum), have been used for thousands of years in a form of divination through dreams, called oneiromancy, in which practitioners seek to receive psychic or prophetic information during dream states. The term oneirogen commonly describes a wide array of psychoactive plants and chemicals ranging from normal dream enhancers to intense dissociative or deliriant drugs. Effects experienced with the use of oneirogens may include microsleep, hypnagogia, fugue states, rapid eye movement sleep (REM), hypnic jerks, lucid dreams, and out-of-body experiences. Some oneirogenic substances are said to have little to no effect on waking consciousness, and will not exhibit their effects until the user falls into a natural sleep state.
Pacific Rim 2 Just Took A Huge Step Forward By Brent McKnight Random Article Blend

The next chapter of Guillermo del Toro 's massive mechs versus monsters saga, Pacific Rim 2 , just took a huge, lumbering step forward.Talking to Yahoo , del Toro, who delivers their gothic haunted house horror film Crimson Peak later this year, revealed that, after many false starts and pushed release dates, Pacific Rim 2 will indeed begin filming this November.

Gideon needs to put their house in order, pronto.
That's the message I'm taking from the fact that the previous article on this blog – Austerity programme proved to be nonsense based on a spreadsheet mistake – has become the most popular ever to appear here. More than 10,000 of you read it within 24 hours of publication.
Clearly, the fact that a principal pillar of their faith – the work by Harvard economists Reinhart and Rogoff – has been disproved, and by a student at a rival university, should have shaken their confidence. It is also ironic for a member of the Conservative Party to realise that they would have got their sums right, if they had done them the old-fashioned way.
But we've had no expressions of apology or acts of contrition from the Treasury. It seems Mr Osborne is determined to keep going, no matter what damage this causes.
I don't reckon that's good enough. I think they should be brought to account. So I have written them a letter, asking them to justify their position.
I reproduce it below. If you agree that it is time Mr Osborne put their cards on the table, you might wish to consider using it as a template for a letter of your own.
Here it is:
The Right Honourable George Osborne MP
Chancellor of the Exchequer
HM Treasury
Horse Guards Road
London SW1A 2HQ
Dear Chancellor,
Following the revelation that a fundamental justification for your austerity policy has been disproved – the paper by Reinhart and Rogoff that was based on a mistake on a spreadsheet – I am writing to ask: What other documentary evidence do you have that supports your policy of economic austerity?
I am mindful of the fact that one of your aides is quoted in The Guardian newspaper as saying “the suggestion that the case for dealing with fiscal deficits and debt rests on one paper is patently absurd” (http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2013/apr/18/uncovered-error-george-osborne-austerity), but this person did not provide any other examples.
It should also be noted that this aide added, “It remains the case that the majority of economists still back the government's strategy.” I await proof to justify this statement as well. Perhaps it is worthwhile to remind you that, of the 20 economists who publicly backed the Osborne Austerity plan in 2010, only one was willing to publicly back it in August last year. Nine publicly disavowed you, and the other 10 had no comment or went on holiday (http://www.newstatesman.com/blogs/politics/2012/08/exclusive-osbornes-supporters-turn-him).
Be advised that it will not be enough for you to discount the quotations above because they come from left-wing sources. As it stands at the moment, the situation is that your policy has no evidence to support it, nor does it have the support of expert opinion that is being claimed for it. Bear in mind that even the International Monetary Fund is criticising your policy, despite having been a staunch support in 2010.
You will recall that the Coalition came into being, nearly three years ago, for the specific purpose of bringing the economy under control. Your policy is the instrument with which this was to be done.
If you do not provide evidence to support its continuation, then what are we, the public, to think? That you are inflicting austerity on us – primarily upon the poorest of us – purely to shrink the state? To sell off the profitable parts to private industry, for the good of private bank balances rather than for the benefit of the nation as a whole? For spite?
If I were in that position, honour would demand an admission of the mistake and either an alteration of policy to one that is more likely to support economic growth (I understand alternatives are available) or – considering this government that was formed to fix the economy has spent three years doing the exact opposite – the dissolution of this administration and election of one that is better-equipped to make the best decisions, in the interest of the nation as a whole.
I look forward to your response.

There are few rivalries as strong in the mobile world as the one between Samsung and Apple fans. Apple fans insist Samsung is nothing more than a cheap copy of Apple, Samsung insists that the iPhone is locked down and inferior to the Galaxy series. With the Galaxy S6 and S6 Edge finally pushing their design forward, this argument is apparently about to get even more heated. How heated? At least in the case of two Tulsa area roommates, it's a subject worth stabbing over. No, we aren't kidding.
KTUL.com – Tulsa, Oklahoma – News, Weather
Apparently, two men were drinking in their apartment and the conversation turned to smartphones. One of the men adamantly believed the new Samsung Galaxy was better than the iPhone 6, the other guy didn't agree. The logical progression here was for both men to break their beer bottles and start stabbing one another.
It's unclear who started our fight, but our best bet is it was the jealous iPhone user (kidding!). The morale of the story? When drinking, it's best to avoid sensitive subjects like religion, politics, and apparently favorite smartphone brands.
Native to the Indo-Pacific and Red Sea, lionfish can be found year-round in Florida waters and from North Carolina to South America, including the Gulf of Mexico. They can be found in almost all estuarine and marine habitat types and have been found in waters up to 1,000 feet deep.
Rarely caught on hook-and-line, the most effective methods of removal are spearing and using a hand-held net. Care should be taken when spear fishing so that the spears do not impact and damage reefs.
Lionfish are also caught as bycatch in the commercial lobster and stone crab trap industry. There is evidence that lionfish are not actually getting stuck in traps but can come and go as they please, only being harvested when they happen to be inside the trap as it is being pulled up.
The practice of feeding lionfish to other predatory species while diving should be avoided because it is dangerous and illegal. It is also proven to not be effective.
Belarusian President Alyaksandr Lukashenka has ordered their government to switch to U.S. dollars and euros in trading with Russia.
Lukashenka said at the Cabinet's session in Minsk on December 18 that "a task has been defined, which is to switch to dollars in trade with Russia, the way we pay for energy."
Lukashenka added that Belarus should have already demanded all payments from Russia in dollars and euros only.
Lukashenka's statement comes amid a sharp decline in gthe exchange rate of the Russian ruble in recent weeks and less than two weeks before the Eurasian Economic Union, linking Russia, Belarus, and Kazakhstan, is scheduled to start functioning.
The ruble's fall has strained Russia's ties with its ex-Soviet neighbors.
Russia and Belarus have been at odds since late November, after Russia banned imports of meat and milk from Belarus, claiming it found traces of harmful substances. Minsk has also refused to follow Moscow's lead in introducing bans on food products from the European Union.

NASA's Orion capsule sits atop a United Launch Alliance Delta 4 Heavy rocket inside the Mobile Service Tower at Florida's Cape Canaveral Air Force Station ahead of its first test flight, which is scheduled to take place on Dec. 4, 2014.
A spaceship built to carry humans is about to venture into deep space for the first time in more than four decades.
NASA's Orion space capsule is scheduled to blast off on its first test flight Thursday (Dec. 4). The unmanned mission, called Exploration Flight Test-1 (EFT-1), will send Orion zooming about 3,600 miles (5,800 kilometers) from Earth, before rocketing back to the planet at high speeds to test out the capsule's heat shield, avionics and a variety of other systems.
No human-spaceflight vehicle has traveled so far since 1972, when the last of NASA's Apollo moon missions came back to Earth. Indeed, in all that time, no craft designed to carry crews has made it beyond low-Earth orbit (LEO), just a few hundred miles from the planet. [Photos: NASA's Orion Space Capsule EFT-1 Test Flight]
If all goes according to plan, Orion will eventually fly farther than any Apollo capsule ever did, taking astronauts to near-Earth asteroids and — by the mid-2030s — the ultimate destination, Mars.
"I gotta tell you, this is special," Bob Cabana, director of NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Florida, said about EFT-1 during a press briefing last month. "This is our first step on that journey to Mars."
The challenges of deep space
Getting people safely to and from destinations in deep space poses challenges that the engineers of NASA's last crewed spaceship, the now-retired space shuttle, never had to consider. (No space shuttle ever traveled beyond Earth orbit.)
For example, if a problem develops aboard a spaceship in LEO, astronauts can theoretically be on the ground in less than an hour. But it would take days for a vehicle out by the moon or beyond to get home, said NASA Orion Program Manager Mark Geyer.
"So you've gotta have highly reliable systems, and you've gotta have capabilities to protect the crew in case of a contingency," they said during last month's briefing. [The Orion Capsule: NASA's Next Spaceship (Photos)]
One such capabilitiy will allow crewmembers aboard Orion to survive in their spacesuits for up to six days if the capsule gets depressurized, Geyer added.
"So if we have a totally depressed cabin, they can be in their suits and we can get them home," they said.
Deep-space vehicles are also exposed to higher radiation levels than vessels that stay in Earth orbit, where they are protected by the planet's magnetic field. So the shielding on Orion must be ample to safeguard the capsule's electronic equipment, Geyer said.
(Orion is designed to support astronauts for just 21 days at a time, so the need to protect crewmembers from radiation is not a big design driver. On longer missions — to Mars, for example — astronauts will spend most of their transit time in a deep-space habitat attached to Orion; the capsule's chief job is to get astronauts into space and back home again.)
Astronauts on deep-space missions will also return to Earth at much higher speeds than do crews that never venture beyond orbit.
"So the heat shield has to be different — different materials, different thicknesses," Geyer said. "And, actually, the physics of entry changes when you come back at those higher speeds."
The need to deal with those high re-entry speeds explains why Orion is a capsule, just like the spaceships that took astronauts to the moon and back during the Apollo program.
"The shape is the best shape for coming in from that high speed," said Mike Hawes, Orion program manager at the aerospace firm Lockheed Martin, which built the capsule for NASA.
Different than Apollo
But Orion is far from a carbon copy of the Apollo command module. For starters, it's bigger. Orion, which is designed to carry up to six astronauts, stands 10.8 feet tall (3.3 meters) and measures 16.5 feet (5 m) across the base. The three-person Apollo capsule was 10.6 feet tall by 12.8 feet wide (3.2 by 3.9 m). Orion contains 316 cubic feet (8.9 cubic m) of habitable volume, compared to 218 cubic feet (6.2 cubic m) for Apollo.
Technology has also advanced a great deal since the Apollo command module was put together.
"The Avcoat material, which we're using on the [Orion] heat shield, is similar to the Avcoat used on Apollo, although we have had to make some changes due to materials changes," Hawes said. "But the technology of just about everything else that we used to put in Orion and to build Orion have changed dramatically in that time.
"You think of 50 years of manufacturing changes — it's a totally different world," they added. "And in fact, we do have additive-manufactured [3D-printed] parts on Orion today."
The huge Saturn V rocket that blasted Apollo toward the moon was retired long ago, so Orion will rely on a different launch vehicle as well. EFT-1 will use a United Launch Alliance Delta 4 Heavy rocket, but future Orion missions will ride atop NASA's Space Launch System megarocket (SLS), which is currently in development.
SLS and Orion are scheduled to fly together for the first time in 2017 or 2018, on the capsule's second unmanned test flight; the duo's first manned mission should come in 2021.

If you live south of London, chances are your train journey could soon be powered by solar energy. Well, sort of.
New research by Imperial College and green energy charity 10:10, has found that solar energy could supply ten per cent of the power needed to fuel the UK's DC-powered rail routes.

The report argues that this can be achieved at a cheaper rate than if the network were fuelled by normal electricity supplies as solar would bypass the national grid and avoid subsidiary costs.
According to the Riding Sunbeams report, 15 per cent of the train networks across Kent, East Sussex and West Sussex could be powered by track-connected solar PV arrays.

On top of this, six per cent of the London Underground's energy demand could also be supplied by solar-power. This is about half of the electricity used on the Piccadilly line. In the north of England, 20 per cent of the Merseyrail network in Liverpool could also be solar-powered. Rail networks closer to the equator could be completely supplied by solar PV arrays, the report explains.
"This study has concentrated on confirming that the power from a typical solar farm site could be matched with the patterns of train energy use," says Nathaniel Bottrell, an overseer of the project and a researcher at Imperial College. "The good news is that this is technically feasible and economically attractive."

By using direct current (DC) rail systems, the solar energy, which is also DC, would not need to be converted to and from alternating current (AC) systems, saving an estimated £4.5 million per year. "It just so happens that solar rays produce direct current (DC) electricity," says Leo Murray, director of 10:10. The railway needs 750 vaults of DC electricity, and solar comes in at between 600 and 800. "This is a very happy coincidence that solar energy produces the same type and same voltage the trains need," Murray says.
Riding Sunbeams
DC railway networks were some of the first to be built in the UK and have since been replaced with safer AC networks. In AC networks, the electricity cables are above the train rather than near the track, making them less dangerous. However, the compatibility of DC lines with solar rays means the study by Imperial College and 10:10 only focuses on DC traction networks for solar energy expansion.
"The fall in the cost of storage now make this proposal economically feasible," Bottrell says. Advances in storage technology mean that there is no energy waste from the solar rays. "There could be times when there is power available from the solar panels but no train close by to use it," adds Bottrell, as often the flow of energy has to be constant. This is solved by including a battery to store the energy and support the rail network during the evening or following the morning rush-hour.
"All of this equipment must be compatible with the railway systems, notably it must pass tests to prove it does not interfere with the things like the signalling system," says Bottrell. However, the report predicts these tests could be approved and effectively implemented in two to three years.
"There may not be a business case for implementing storage systems in the first place," Murray says. But installing storage systems down the network rail lines could be costly and will be something Network Rail needs to look into, they add.

Phillip Thies, a senior lecturer of renewable energy at Exeter University agrees that business negotiations may prove the biggest complication for the idea. "The proposed method is to install them on land close to the power substations. This may have practical implications regarding availability of land and planning permits for large-scale solar arrays," they say. Nevertheless, they say the research provides a robust basis to explore potential investment in more detail.
However, in terms of vision, the UK may already be falling behind. India has the most ambitious target for implementing a solar-powered network, hoping to make 100 gigawatts of energy from solar PV generating capacity by 2022. "We have also seen news of something a bit similar in the Netherlands where the Dutch rail network is being powered by 100 per cent renewable energy," says Tim Green, director of the Energy Futures Lab at Imperial College London and lead on this project.
While the UK remains small-scale in vision, ultimately such proposals could be more significant for proving the economic advantages of solar. "It unlocks direct access to a major purchaser of energy in a way which enables subsidy-free solar energy to expand," Green says.
As we've told you many times, we believe the FISA Amendments Act is unconstitutional and have taken it to the Supreme Court . There's not a vote in sight in the Senate. Frankly, that's not a bad thing. We won't be disappointed if it sunsets on Dec. 31, as scheduled.
However, it's likely the Senate will eventually vote to reauthorize FISA, and its extraordinary authority to collect international communications coming in and out of the U.S. without a warrant. But senators Wyden, Leahy, Merkley and Tester are working hard to offer amendments that would increase transparency about the use of this very powerful spying law and insert common- sense protections for Americans' information.
With just two weeks until Christmas recess, will the Senate dedicate time to a robust debate about our Constitutional rights and vote on pressing privacy issues? Or will FISA slip by in the dead of night?

The coordinate system appears to be "flipped" by AppKit standards, so the origin is in the upper-left.
Even though the APIs may have the same names, they may not behave the same. For example, [view setWantsLayer:YES] isn't enough in Cappuccino. You need to actually instantiate a CALayer yourself and add it to the view.

First Look at Cappuccino and Objective-J
Posted Sep 5, 2008 — 46 comments below Posted Sep 5, 2008 — 46 comments below
You've probably heard of 280 Slides , which is an exceptionally polished Keynote-like presentation app for the web. The creators, 280 North , today published the framework and language used to create it, called Cappuccino and Objective-J , respectively. I only had a few hours to play with both, so keep in mind this is a very early review.The executive summary is that Cappuccino is re-implementation of many of the basic parts of Cocoa, and Objective-J is a language which looks nearly identical to Objective-C and "compiles down" into JavaScript. You can also use JavaScript right inline with Objective-J, similar to how you can use C in Objective-C.Mac OS X Leopard has 82 built-in frameworks, and Cappuccino implementsof only two of them: Foundation and AppKit. There is an implementation of certain data structures of Core Animation as well, but Iit's misleading to call it a port because there's no OpenGL underlying it so none of the fancy 3D effects are available.There is a lot of one-to-one mapping of common classes, such asbeing equivalent tobeing equivalent to, and so on. Some of the CoreGraphics/Quartz API is implemented as well. Browsing the Cappuccino class documentation gives you a pretty good idea of what's going on. 280 North has done an incredible amount of work here.That said, you generally won't be able to take a modern, multi-framework Mac app and "recompile" it for Cappuccino. Some small apps might be able to pull it off with a bit of renaming and reshuffling, but any moderately complex app would be stranded. As a simple example, there isn't a, but there is a, which I assume is close toThis isn't a knock against 280 North — all of this is really, really difficult to do. It's just important to understand that this doesn't mean all Mac apps can suddenly run on the web.What itmean is that Xcode and Interface Builder are now reasonable prototyping tools for web apps based on Cappuccino, and Mac programmers can now quickly become very effective client-side web developers. The transition is somewhat similar to developing for iPhone — fundamentally similar concepts, but a slightly different inventory in the utility belt.What's most shocking initially is how practically anyone could mistake Objective-J for Objective-C:If you change theline and rename everything fromto, this would probably compile as Objective-C. In my experiments, I did run into some obvious missing methods, such as, but a ton of it is already here in the first release.As a Cocoa/Objective-C programmer, it's easily to forget that you're writing a web app. For example, here's some code I wrote today to make a draggable box ():Other than replacingwithandwith, this is, verbatim, how you'd do it in Cocoa. You don't have to think about any sort of DOM queries or JavaScript of any sort. For Mac and iPhone developers, this is beginning of something very big.One question that occurred to me immediately is how to incorporate server-side frameworks into the stack. Cappuccino is, after all, a client-side framework, so you'll need to need a separate server-side piece () in most cases. I haven't had much time to look at this, but the Cappuccino Flickr demo seems to use an asynchronous JSON request to fetch data and display it as it arrives. I'll need to spend more time with it to figure out the details.One side note here: Cappuccinoto like to take over the whole browser window. I experimented with adding my own bare CSS-styled DIVs at arbitrary locations in the canvas and I didn't have a lot of success. Not sure if this is by design I was doing something wrong. The documentation does make it clear that Cappuccino is intended to create web-based, though, not web pages.The biggest technical hurdle right now is the size of the framework. The AppKit implementation is 18k lines long, and Foundation is about 5k. When I asked the 280 North guys about this earlier in the year, they seemed to think server-side compression was a reasonable solution. This isn't my area of speciality, though, so I can't really comment on it.A few quick things I figured out today:One last note: there are a set of tools provided to improve the development process, including a pre-interpreter () and plug-ins for TextMate and SubEthaEdit.Overall, a very big day for Cocoa and iPhone developers looking to deploy web apps. Major kudos to 280 North.

Scalia: These court rulings would've erased America from history
Arizona is beleaguered by an illegal alien population larger than the size of any colony when the Constitution was ratified. Yet the state is completely prevented by puny lower courts from protecting its self-determination (sovereignty). At the same time, the island state of Hawaii, under our misguided and corrupt conception of the federal judiciary, has the ability to violate the self-determination of the entire nation and demand that the federal government bring in unlimited number of immigrants from the Middle East.
Turning state sovereignty on its head
Once again, the Justice Department found itself in the palace of the Ninth Circuit this week defending national sovereignty on an issue that should never have come before a court. Given that national sovereignty and immigration statutes no longer have meaning, the three-judge panel haggled with plaintiffs and the DOJ during oral arguments not over the law but over the meaning of the Supreme Court's edict to allow in anyone with “bona fide” ties to America from countries included in the immigration moratorium order.
In July, the six liberal justices on the Supreme Court refused to stay the temporary injunction of Judge Watson, who ordered the administration to allow in all brothers-in-law, sisters-in-law, aunts, uncles, nieces, nephews, and cousins not only of citizens but even of immigrants residing in America. SCOTUS kicked the decision back to the Ninth Circuit, which dealt with the issue during Monday's hearing. But there's one important detail that has been lost in the circus of judicial supremacy and stolen sovereignty: the lead plaintiff in this case is the state of Hawaii. How can a state get standing, much less win on the merits, to require the federal government to bring in more immigrants than it desires in order to satisfy a state?
Which brings us to Arizona.
For years, the federal court system has tampered with every effort by Arizona citizens to deal with their systemic problems caused by illegal immigration. Every commonsense law enforcement initiative, voting integrity law, and financial protection act was “struck down” by the wacky district judges and the Ninth Circuit. The courts said over and over again that the federal government has so much power over immigration that a state can't even independently complement or enforce immigration laws.
Yet now the courts are saying states can demand more immigration and even strong-arm the plenary federal power over immigration to do so. They have flipped sovereignty on its head — upside-down, inside-out — narrowly interpreting sovereignty as the least common denominator of the desire to restrict between the federal and state governments rather than the greatest common factor of each one's desire to protect its own sovereignty.
Which brings us to Justice Scalia.
Nobody explained this concept better than Scalia, in their dissent in Arizona v. U.S. on the state's 2010 immigration enforcement law, S.B. 1070. But first some background on S.B. 1070.
S.B. 1070 had four major provisions: It made illegal immigration in Arizona a state crime, made it a misdemeanor for an illegal to seek employment in the state, authorized warrantless arrests of those suspected of being here illegally based on probable cause, and required law enforcement to make a reasonable attempt to ascertain the immigration status of those lawfully detained when there is reasonable suspicion to believe they are here illegally.
District Judge Susan Bolton invalidated all the provisions, as did the Ninth Circuit. The Supreme Court “struck down” the first three provisions, but upheld the provision requiring law enforcement to check immigration status.
Scalia would have upheld all four provisions, and in their mind, it wasn't even close. Arizona was the victim, while the lawless courts and their allies in the legal profession were the aggressors.
Scalia began their dissent by noting that states have complete sovereignty over their territory unless their acts are specifically and directly barred by the federal government:
Today's opinion, ap­proving virtually all of the Ninth Circuit's injunction against enforcement of the four challenged provisions of Arizona's law, deprives States of what most would consider the defining characteristic of sovereignty: the power to exclude from the sovereign's territory people who have no right to be there. Neither the Constitution itself nor even any law passed by Congress supports this result.
They went on to prove how the Founders and early political leaders gave immigration policy to the federal government in order to protect the sovereignty of the states, not violate it:
In other words, the naturalization power was given to Con­gress not to abrogate States' power to exclude those they did not want, but to vindicate it.
Thus, both the Constitution and the inherent right to sovereignty rooted in social compact theory dictates that federal control over immigration should primarily be in one direction: more restrictive than states would want, not less restrictive. Now, obviously, once the feds were given final say over immigration, the letter of the law dictates that states cannot prevent immigrants from settling within their borders where statute otherwise authorizes it. However, as Scalia noted, a state “has the sovereign power to protect its borders more rigorously if it wishes, absent any valid federal prohibition,” and in this case, “Arizona is entitled to have ‘its own immigration policy'—including a more rigorous enforcement policy—so long as that does not conflict with federal law.”
Yet, over the past decade, Judge Susan Bolton and several other leftist judges have stolen the sovereignty of the state and voted down, like a super-legislature or an executive veto, every commonsense measure that passed either via state law or ballot initiative. They overturned an anti-smuggling law in 2014 as well.
In 2006, 77 percent of voters approved Arizona Proposition 100, which denied bail to illegal aliens charged with “serious felony offenses.” After this measure was “struck down” by the Ninth Circuit, the Supreme Court refused to hear the case. In dissenting from the denial of certiorari, Thomas and Scalia were furious. “Our indifference to cases such as this one will only embolden the lower courts to reject state laws on questionable constitutional grounds,” wrote Thomas.
Returning to the Ninth Circuit case involving Hawaii, ponder for a moment the astonishing hypocrisy of courts upholding federal powers over immigration to such an extreme that states cannot even complement federal laws, while at the same time, states that want liberal immigration policies can directly veto federal laws. Further juxtapose this with the growing list of lower courts that are not only upholding sanctuary laws but mandating sanctuary cities by preventing states and localities from cooperating with ICE detainer requests.
The rulings of these lower, Congress-created courts, which overturn immigration law, popular sovereignty, the social compact, and settled case law stating courts have no jurisdiction over immigration, are now considered the law of the land.
The forgotten man of Arizona
What about the forgotten man of Arizona who never violated any law? Take heed of what Scalia wrote at the end of their partial dissent in Arizona v. U.S., universally heralded by conservatives and libertarians:
As is often the case, discussion of the dry legalities that are the proper object of our attention suppresses the very human realities that gave rise to the suit. Arizona bears the brunt of the country's illegal immigration problem. Its citizens feel themselves under siege by large numbers of illegal immigrants who invade their property, strain their social services, and even place their lives in jeopardy. Federal officials have been unable to remedy the problem, and indeed have recently shown that they are unwilling to do so. Thousands of Arizona's estimated 400,000 illegal immigrants—including not just children but men and women under 30—are now assured immunity from en­forcement, and will be able to compete openly with Ari­zona citizens for employment. Arizona has moved to protect its sovereignty—not in contradiction of federal law, but in complete compliance with it. The laws under challenge here do not extend or revise federal immigration restrictions, but merely enforce those restrictions more effectively. If securing its territory in this fashion is not within the power of Arizona, we should cease referring to it as a sovereign State.
There is something fundamentally wrong when lower court judges can destroy our heritage, values, and sovereignty and twist the Constitution and natural law in the most grotesque fashion without facing any reprisal, check, or balance. There is something fundamentally wrong when people delegitimize the pardon of one sheriff — whether you agree or disagree with Trump's decision — but unquestionably support the de facto judicial pardons of millions of illegal aliens, including some of the most violent ones, even though courts manifestly lack such power. Moreover, Obama illegally “pardoned” (plus gave affirmative benefits to) 900,000 illegal aliens, including the likes of Salvador Diaz-Garcia, who allegedly raped a 19-year old American and broke almost every bone in their face, and yet the courts are using those illegal pardons as a cudgel against Arizona.
Scalia posed the following question at the end of their epic dissent, addressing the political problems of stolen sovereignty at the hands of a lawless executive. The same applies today to the lawless judiciary:
Are the sovereign States at the mercy of the Federal Executive's refusal to enforce the Nation's immigration laws? A good way of answering that question is to ask: Would the States conceivably have entered into the Union if the Constitution itself contained the Court's holding?
With polls showing Arizona's junior senator, Jeff Flake, down by as many as 26 points in their primary against Kelli Ward, an unprecedented position for an incumbent, it's very possible that the people of Arizona are ready to answer this question.
Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Amateur video appeared to show the audience booing as Vladimir Putin started to speak
Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has been booed at a martial arts contest in Moscow in an apparent show of public protest.
Mr Putin stepped into the ring at the end of a fight on Sunday between Russian fighter Fedor Emelianenko and their American opponent, Jeff Monson.
As they started to speak, the audience began booing and hissing, in scenes broadcast live on Russian TV.
Mr Putin's supporters later claimed the audience was jeering Mr Monson.
The director of the Olimpisky stadium which hosted the fight, Mikhail Moskalyov, told local media that the audience was reacting as the American fighter left the ring.
End of an era?
However, the Kremlin's critics say the outburst was in fact a sign of Mr Putin's declining popularity, reports the BBC's Steve Rosenberg in Moscow.
Image copyright Other Image caption Mr Putin was congratulating Mr Emelianenko on their win when the audience began booing
Prominent activist and blogger Alexei Navalny said on Twitter that the incident heralded "the end of an era".
The main news show on Russia's Channel One later tightly edited the speech, showing only the one phrase that provoked a cheer from the crowd, the AFP news agency reports.
However, the uncensored broadcast has been uploaded to YouTube, where on Monday it had been viewed more than 500,000 times.
Mr Putin is planning to return to the presidency in elections to be held next March.
Although their approval ratings are still high, at 61%, that figure has fallen by 16% from last year.
In a selfie taken in October, Susan Marinello playfully sticks their tongue out while posing in front of the boarded up Baker Hotel in Mineral Wells.
“Because Being Crazy isn't enough. I want it all. And being in places I shouldn't be makes me feel like I can do anything,” the caption reads in the self portrait. “This was one of my biggest #UrbexProjects. I climbed some exterior walls, Knocked down some wooden boards, climbed through broken glass, and I have the battle wounds to prove it. I'm Crazy, but sometimes that's not even enough.”
Perhaps it should have been enough.
Last month, Marinello returned to the historic hotel, once again sharing their adventure with Instagram followers.

Now, the Texas Tech student is facing up to a $500 fine after a tipster sent Mineral Wells police a photo that Marinello shot inside the historic hotel. Investigators later uncovered more pictures and postings allegedly made by the photographer in which they boasted about hiding from police while there.
Mineral Wells Police Chief Dean Sullivan said the postings, made on a variety of social media websites, read “almost like a chronology of criminal activity” and corresponded with a March 26 police call to the hotel.
Sullivan said Marinello wrote about hiding in the dark as police boarded up their exit before finally escaping.
“It's like a play-by-play brought to you by the suspect via Twitter,” Sullivan said.
On Friday, police mailed Marinello a Class C misdemeanor citation for occupying a dangerous structure, a violation of the city's municipal code.
“I guess I'm officially a street artist with my first citation,” Marinello quipped during a telephone interview with the Star-Telegram.
They said they received the citation in the mail on Monday.
‘Trespass if you dare'
Marinello, 27, said they have spent 3 years documenting abandoned buildings for an urban exploration book that they are publishing. They said they bring only their camera, flashes and a flashlight, and leaves no trace of their presence inside.
“When I go to these places, I don't leave something behind like ‘I was here,'” Marinello said. “The only thing I take are the images. … I have a lot of respect for these places.”
Marinello, owner of Peace Love & Sue Photography, said they have been intrigued by the Baker Hotel for some time and was motivated to capture its beauty in its current state before its proposed renovation.
“That hotel, every floor has different carpeting, different wallpaper,” they said. “All that detail is going to be gutted out. All that wallpaper from the 20s is going to be gutted and nobody is going to see it again.”
One of their photographs, taken of the hotel's main ballroom, is the cover piece of a photo gallery of abandoned structures she's photographed. The gallery, they said, is an early draft of a book they are publishing called Beauty in the Forgotten … trespass if you dare.
But Sullivan said Marinello's profession as a photographer does not place them above the law.
“Just because you're an artist, … that doesn't give you carte blanche just to enter,” Sullivan said.
‘It's not legal to enter'
In 2013, Mineral Wells police wrote 24 citations at the hotel and made two arrests, one for burglary of a building and the theft of metal and the other for criminal mischief/graffiti. A dozen others, many of them juveniles, were given written warnings for being on hotel property, Sullivan said.
With a referendum on the May 10 ballot to dedicate an eighth of a cent of the city's sales tax to the historic hotel's renovation — and the media attention it has drawn — police have stepped up their checks on the hotel, Sullivan said.
“We're having a lot more people breaking in just for curiosity's sake,” Sullivan said
In the last three days alone, Sullivan said, police issued nine citations for seven people found at the hotel.
Marinello insists that they did not break into the Baker Hotel during either of their two visits.
“For me, at least, I have rules when I do this. … If it's open and accessible, then I go and do it,” they said.
The first time, they said, they entered the hotel by crawling through through a broken window. Last month, they entered through a door that they described as “wide open.”
“I just walked right in from the balcony,” they said.
Sullivan said “no trespassing” signs are posted around the hotel, along with a condemnation notice on the hotel's entrance.
“Open door or otherwise — it's not legal to enter and it's posted as such,” Sullivan said.
Changing their own rules
Marinello acknowledges that they did hide after hearing noises inside the building but said they did not initially know it was a police officer.
“It was dark. I couldn't see who was on the other side of the lobby,” Marinello said. “When I heard the police officer's walkie-talkie, I was kind of a little bit at ease.”
But as the officer was on their way out, Marinello said they didn't chase them down but decided rather to just leave.
“I'm not going to run to the cop and be like, ‘I was in there. I don't know if you were looking for me,' ” they said.
Marinello said Monday that they were debating whether just to pay the $117 flat fine or fight the citation in court “just because I don't think they have the full story and full understanding.”
“I'm so passionate about what I do,” Marinello said. “I'm not a rambunctious 19-year-old. I'm 27. I have two children. I'm going back to school. I'm just really passionate about art.”
Either way, Marinello said, she'll add an addition to their “Urban Exploring Rules” — get permission beforehand.
As promised here is part two of my App Store experiment. If you haven't done so already then it's probably best to read part 1 of this experiment first. (Part 3 is also available here)
The Charity
In part one I asked for suggestions for charities to donate the sales to. I received many great suggestions but I settled on a local Perth charity @Footprints2013. I hope it helps a little to their goals.
The Blog Post
As many of you guessed part 1 of this blog post was the next experiment. The blog post did reasonably well, almost 20k page views, 220+ Tweets, 50 Facebook shares and number 2 on the front page of Hacker News.
And everyone knows the front page of Hacker News is instant success for any product, right?
What Goes Up, Must Come Down
When the downloads began to fall, they kept falling in a very neat curve. As you can see the front page of Hacker News didn't have any noticeable impact.
In-App Purchase
I have a love-hate relationship with in-app purchases. They are the best way currently to provide a trial, but in my opinion are abused by many developers (Kids games are often the worst offenders).
I had many requests to make the workouts a bit more flexible in time and sets, so thought this was the perfect opportunity to add a pro upgrade.
Pretty simple, some decent extra functionality for a few bucks.
How does In-App Purchase (IAP) stack up against a paid download? For this app it's been an increase of over 3x from around $22 per day to around $65 per day. The IAP converts at approximate 2-3% of the downloads per day.
Translating App Store Descriptions
More than 50% of the downloads have always been from the US, with countries like Canada, Netherlands, Philippines and the UK all being about 1/10th of the US.
Something I have seen work well in the past is local App Store description translations. So based on a few recommendations I translated to Portuguese, Japanese, Italian, German, French and Chinese (Simplified). Using https://www.icanlocalize.com this cost approximately $100.
Overall this part of the experiment was a total fail having almost no effect on the number of downloads from any of those countries.
Listening To Users
One thing that was continuously asked for in reviews from AppBot and from support emails was a workout log. So I added one as part of the IAP:
This lifted the IAP sales to around $75 per day:
Flat Design
Flat design has been an interesting one, two major issues have repeated themselves consistently, both around what is tap-able.
First one is the actual rows being tap-able, which I seemed to solve by adding a little disclosure indicator.
The other is the workout log button, people don't realise this is tap-able (and why would they?).
Lessons Learned
IAP increases revenues - For better or worse for the ecosystem as a whole, it's been proven over and over again it makes more money.
- For better or worse for the ecosystem as a whole, it's been proven over and over again it makes more money. Get your IAP ready before going free - I'm sure a big opportunity was missed in the initial rush of downloads to convert IAP sales.
- I'm sure a big opportunity was missed in the initial rush of downloads to convert IAP sales. The big run of downloads won't last forever - It won't last forever, but it does settle into a consistent range you can work with.

The Money Multiplier, RIP?
In case you haven't heard, Simon Wren-Lewis tried to kill the money multiplier earlier this week. And if they succeeded, and the money multiplier stays killed, if it has indeed been well and truly buried, I for one shall not mourn its long overdue passing. Over the course of my almost thirteen months of blogging I have argued on a number of occasions that, contrary to the money multiplier, bank deposits are endogenous, that they are not so many hot potatoes that, once created, must be held, never to be destroyed. This view has brought me into sharp, but friendly, disagreement with some pretty smart guys whom I usually agree with, like Nick Rowe and Bill Wolsey, but I'm not backing down.
My view of bank deposits has also put me in the same camp — or at least created the appearance that I am in the same camp — with the endogenous money group, Post-Keynesians, Modern Monetary Theorists and the like, whose views I only dimly understand. But it seems that they deny that even the monetary base (i.e., currency plus bank reserves) is under the control of the monetary authority. This group seems to think that banks create deposits in the process of lending, lending is undertaken by banks in response to the demands of the public (businesses and households) for bank loans, and reserves are created by the monetary authority to support whatever level of reserves the banks desire, given the amount of lending that they have undertaken. The money multiplier is wrong, in their view, because it implies that reserves are prior to deposits and, indeed, are the raw material from which deposits are created, when in fact reserves are created to support deposits.
So let me try to explain how I view the money multiplier. I agree with the endogenous money people that reserves are not the stuff out of which deposits are created. However, there is a sense in which base money is logically prior to deposits. Every deposit is a promise to pay the bearer something else outside the control of the creator of the deposit. That something is base money. Under a fiat money system, it is a promise to pay currency. Under a gold standard, it was a promise to pay gold, coin or bullion. This distinction is captured by the distinction between inside money (deposits) and outside money (currency).
It is my position that the quantity of inside money produced or created in an economy is endogenously determined by the real demand of the public to hold inside money and the costs banks incur in creating inside money. Because banks legally commit themselves to convert inside money into outside money on demand, arbitrage usually prevents any significant, or even insignificant, deviation between the value of inside and that of outside money. Because inside money and outside money are fairly close substitutes, the value of outside money is determined simultaneously in the markets for inside and outside money, just as the value of butter is determined simultaneously in the markets for butter and margarine. But heuristically, it is convenient to view the value of money as being determined by the supply of and the demand for base money, which then determines the value of inside money via the arbitrage opportunities created by the convertibility of inside into outside money. Given the equality in the values of inside and outside money, we can then view the supply of inside money and the demand for inside money as determining the quantity of deposits and the interest rate paid on deposits. Under competitive conditions, the interest paid on deposits must equal the bank lending rate (the gross revenue from creating a deposit) minus the cost of creating a deposit, so that the net revenue (the lending rate minus the deposit rate) equals the cost of creating deposits.
What determines the value of base money? The monetary authorities (central bank plus the Treasury) jointly determine the amount of currency and reserves made available. The public (banks plus households plus businesses) have demands to hold currency when tax payments are due, demands to hold currency for transactions purposes when taxes are not due, and demands to hold currency as a store of value, those demands depending as well on the expected future value of currency and on the yields of alternative assets including inside money. The total demand for currency versus the total stock in existence determines a value at which the public is just willing to hold the amount currency (base or outside money) in existence.
This theoretical setup is analogous to that which determines the value of money under a gold standard. Under a gold standard the amount of gold in existence is endogenously determined as the sum of all the gold ever mined from time period 0 until the present. But in the present period the total stock can be treated as an exogenously fixed amount. The total demand is the sum of the monetary plus non-monetary demands for gold. The value of gold is whatever value is just sufficient to induce the public to hold the amount in existence in the current period. Given that all prices are quoted in gold, the price level is determined by the conversion rate of money into gold times the gold value of every commodity corresponding to the equilibrium real value of gold. The amount of inside money in existence is whatever amount of convertible claims into gold the public wishes to hold given the yields on alternative assets and expectations of the future value of gold.
The operation of a gold standard requires no legal reserves of gold to be held. Legal reserve requirements were an add-on to the gold standard – in my view an unnecessary and dysfunctional add-on – imposed by legislation enacted by various national governments for their own, often misguided, reasons. That is not to say that it would not be prudent for monetary authorities to hold some reserves of gold, but the decision how many reserves to hold has no intrinsic connection to the operation of the gold standard.
Thus, the notion that there is any fixed relationship between the quantity of gold and the amount of convertible banknotes or bank deposits created by the banking system under the gold standard is a logical fallacy. The amount of banknotes and deposits created corresponded to the amount of banknotes and deposits the public wanted to hold, and was in no way logically connected to the amount of gold in existence. Similarly, under a fiat money system, there is no logical connection between the amount of base money and the amount of inside money. The money multiplier is simply a reduced-form, not a structural, equation. Treating it as a structural equation in which the total stock of money (currency plus demand deposits) in existence could be juxtaposed with the total demand to hold money is logically incoherent, because the money multiplier (as a reduced form) is itself determined in part by the demand to hold currency and the demand to hold deposits.
So it's about time that we got rid of the money multiplier, and I wish Simon Wren-Lewis all the luck in the world in trying to drive a stake into its heart, but somehow I am not all that confident that we have yet seen the last of that pesky creature.
PS I hope, circumstances permitting, tomorrow to continue with my series on Earl Thompson's reformulation of macroeconomics. This post can perhaps serve as introduction to a future post in the series on alternative versions of the LM curve corresponding to different monetary regimes.

ONE of Scotland's most popular tourist attractions has been forced to close “indefinitely” for safety reasons - only five days after making the top ten in a global search for the 8th Wonder of the World.
Dunnottar Castle, one of Scotland's most spectacular ruined fortresses, was placed seventh in the global vote last week.
But Dunecht estates, which owns the castle near Stonehaven in Aberdeenshire , has now announced that the fortress is to be closed until further notice due to the need to carry out urgent repairs to the roof of one of the main buildings on the approach to the main castle complex.
The castle, which inspired Princess Merida's family home in Disney-Pixar's Brave and doubled for Elsinore in Franco Zeffirelli's Hamlet, is normally only closed to the public for two days at Christmas and two days at New Year.
A notice, posted on the castle's website, states: “It seems a shame to follow all the good new of recent times with some bad news, but we regret to say that Dunnottar Castle will remain closed indefinitely at the moment due to urgent repairs required to Benholm's Lodging roof.
“The castle will remain closed to allow scaffolding to be erected in the first place to ensure the health and safety of castle visitors and staff while works are assessed. “
The statement continues: “Those of you who know the castle well will know that this is the huge building which looms over you as you climb the steps up to the castle entrance. These works were scheduled for next year but circumstances have dictated that they must be done now, to ensure the health and safety of our visitors and staff. It is a sad day for all of the staff and management team involved here but safety must come first. “
Wendy Sylvester, the custodian at Dunnottar Castle, said: “We are planning to put scaffolding up around the building next week to allow people to come in, but we are not sure how long that is going to take. We will then asses the work that needs to be done to the roof so visitors can still come to the castle.
“But we are saying the castle will be closed ‘indefinitely' at the moment because are not sure how long it is going to take.
Ms Sylvester: explained “Benholm's Lodging is a big building right above the entranceway to the castle. The roof is in need of repair. We had been planning to do the roof next summer but it has just come to light that we probably need to give it some attention now.
“We are normally one of the few castles that are open at this time of the year. We are only closed on Christmas Day and Boxing Day and 1 and 2 January. We don't close for six months of the year like some other castles which can do all these works as a matter of course every year.”
ms Sylvester added: “We have had a lot of extra visitors since the publicity about the eighth wonder of the world competition. And it's a shame that there are now all these visitors with nowhere to go.”
Dunnottar Castle was recently awarded a Certificate of Excellence from TripAdvisor, placing them in the top-performing ten per cent of all businesses worldwide on the travel website.
There has been a keep on the rocky headland which dominates Stonehaven since the Middle Ages. William Wallace, Mary Queen of Scots, the Marquis of Montrose and King Charles II have all graced the castle with their presence.
The castle was besieged by William Wallace in 1297 and later became the seat of the Earls Marischal, one of the most powerful families in Scotland.
In the 17th Century the castle played a key role in Scottish history when its small garrison held out against a siege by Oliver Cromwell's army for eight months. The Earl Marischal had been given the “Honours of Scotland” - the Scottish Crown Jewels - for safekeeping and the Crown, sceptre and sword were successfully smuggled past Cromwell's blockade.
The ruins also include the “Whig's Vault” where a group of Covenanters, who refused to acknowledge the King's supremacy in spiritual matters, were imprisoned in 1685.
The employment scenario in the country is bleak what with the IT sector, including the startups - a key sector in the jobs market - letting go off employees in large numbers. Cognizant Technologies is the latest in a long line of IT majors that is looking at giving pink slips to nearly 6,000 employees primarily for not meeting performance benchmarks.
While dismissal after performance appraisal is routine, what is compounding the problem is that these companies are not hiring in en masse from campuses as they used to earlier. According to a report in the Business Standard, IT companies are expected to hire 40 percent less this year. The top five IT services companies – TCS, Infosys, Wipro, Cognizant and HCL Technologies – hired around 60,000 engineers from campuses this fiscal, as against little more than 100,000 last year. The reason for the reduction in recruitment at the entry level is on account of aggressive use of automation and technological advances that have rendered the lower level jobs in the sector redundant.
Adding to the worries is the protectionist policies in the US – one of the major offshore business partners and supporters of IT services industry in India – laying restrictions on outsourcing and stringent controls on H1-B visas.
The traditional BPO operations model is being phased out and the $155-billion IT industry in the country is trying to reinvent itself to adjust to the advent of automation, artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning.
According to consulting firm Zinnov, India stands to lose about 94,000 jobs by 2021 due to the increasing adoption of technology.
Industry body Nasscom said in its annual review that while the industry grew at 8.6 percent, jobs grew only by 5 percent in the fiscal year 2016-17. It also said that there is going to be a 20-25 percent reduction in jobs over the next three years.
At the recently held Nasscom Leadership summit in Mumbai, French IT major, Capgemini's India chief executive Srinivas Kandula said that a majority of the workforce cannot imbibe the skill sets required for increasing use of digital technologies, a PTI report said. Kandula warned of high job losses at the middle and senior levels. “I am not very pessimistic, but it is a challenging task and I tend to believe that 60-65 per cent of them are just not trainable,” they said.
The domestic arm of the French IT major employs nearly 100,000 engineers in the country. “A large number of them cannot be trained. Probably, India will witness the largest unemployment in the middle level to senior level,” Kandula said.
In order to support this transformation, the industry players need to prioritise automation as one of their key offerings and build appropriate talent around this area, says Sashi Kumar – CEO and MD of the Bengaluru-based IT firm, Happiest Minds Technologies.
Scope of automation
According to the latest report by the research firm MarketsandMarkets, the global artificial intelligence market is expected to grow from $419.7 million in 2014 to $5.05 billion by 2020, at a CAGR of 53.65 percent from 2015 to 2020.
Where can automation be deployed? It plays an important place in our personal lives – even a microwave in one's home is automation. In business, the benefits of using disruptive innovation with a view to automate is far beyond the costs. Automation can now be used by every department in a business from customer support and marketing, to sales nurturing and client database management, and further more in coding and testing. Coded programs write other programs. However, such level of intelligence is a different discussion all together, says Dhruvil Sanghvi, CEO and Co-Founder, LogiNext.
In broad terms, the biggest automation benefits within a company is with quality assurance. Many companies target six-sigma level of accuracy with their outputs. Such high levels of precision can only be achieved through automation.
Another big integration for automation is data mining for business and marketing insights. There are many trends that can be spotted ahead of time with proper analysis of the vast information database of customer preferences, says Sanghvi of the benefits of automation.
Jobs that are losing lustre and getting replaced by automation are largely low-end jobs where hiring too has come to a standstill. With tools available for verification and validation, business process outsourcing and infra services are losing shine. Even in the pharmaceutical sector, for instance, automation has taken over a large number of testing activities. “In the BPO context, we have seen an improvement in the processes after automation from 20 percent to 60-70 percent,” says Gopinathan Padmanabhan, Chief Innovation Officer and President - Global Delivery, Mphasis.
However, Padmanabhan says that the entire process cannot be automated and some human intervention will still be required. “Those we had to take off the staff from this routine task, around 40 percent of them; we found alternative jobs for them in the firm,” they said. The company has been able to retrain and redeploy them, they said.
However, not all companies are able to retrain or redeploy their staff and hence the retrenchment of staff in large numbers. A big change we see today is that organisations are moving from IT services to intelligent solutions which are based on big data sciences. The reason this is being done is the availability of vast data (with advent of IOT), low cost of storage of data and the need for real-time decision making, says Rohit Verma, CEO, iPredictt, an advanced big data analytics startup.
Outlining an ominous future, Verma said, “In the future, all decision-making processes will adopt self learning algorithms or artificial intelligence, hence tech industry will fast up-skill themselves to service the new environment.”
Replacing humans, Wipro came in with Holmes (heuristics and ontology-based learning machines and experiential systems) in business as well as IT operations. According to sources, Holmes will replace 30,000 engineers.
Holmes has been deployed in data and information-driven industries such as banking and financial services, retail, manufacturing and telecommunications, where it has delivered exceptional results, says K R Sanjiv, Chief Technology Officer, Wipro. “We are looking to expand its scope creating an automation marketplace for Bots where customers can pick the Bots from a library as per their requirement. They can also co-create Bots with us in the Bots Studio for their specific requirements and outside of the areas covered by us,” Sanjiv said.
For those who have still not adopted automation in a big way, there are consulting companies in the IT genre who are showing them the way. “In some cases, we are working with banks using new technologies like Blockchain to create automated, straight through processes around, for example, the mortgage financing process. In others, banks are looking at using robotic process automation combined with other AI techniques and optical character recognition (OCR) to streamline the new customer onboarding process.
“Another interesting area has been bringing increased levels of automation to QA work through a hybrid QA model and Combinatorics testing,” says Sandeep Kumar, managing director, Capital Markets, Synechron - a New York-based information technology and consulting company focused on the financial services industry including capital markets, insurance, banking and digital.
One way of being aligned to the furious pace of technology is to be trained and updated with the industry's requirements or needs and if possible, to be ahead of the change curve. There is always jobs for top talent with transferable skills. IITs are able to provide a strong foundation of skills to build upon in the workforce, says Kumar of Synechron.
Kumar advises students to focus on the current job market and for educational institutes to re-imagine how automation will change today's industries and teachable transferable skills. These will likely be stronger business intelligence and analysis skills, QA work around automated technology processes, exposure to innovative new technologies like Blockchain and AI that will require a deeper skill set. A good understanding of data science-related topics will help in this regard, they say.
Human Resource (HR) management has also kept pace with automation. Led by game changing technologies -- Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning and Bots -- and renewed interest in exceptional User Interfaces, the pace of change has been frenetic in the HR industry. "The mantra now is consumerization of the Enterprise and we are going to see increasing technical innovation in HR technology and Finance Technology. The time is up for large unwieldy all-encompassing systems. Smart Process Applications is the way forward and we will hear more about it as we march along," says Sunil Chathaveetil, Co-founder and Director, MintMesh - a platform for crowd sourcing referrals.
With retrenchment being the order of the day in IT firms with automation replacing routine work done by people, it also gives an opportunity for entrepreneurship. “Automation is not a threat for entreneurship. It is good opportunity to innovate, pilot, prototype ideas that can optimize productivity and cut costs,” says Sashi Chimala, EVP (Products & Platforms) NEN, Wadhwani Foundation which focusses on job acceleration.Some skills that will be high in demand in spite of automation include working with big data, mobile development, cloud computing, digital marketing and machine learning.
Skilling, name of game
An online professional certification provider Simplilearn's State of India Technology Skills Report 2016 with inputs from over 9,200 mid-level IT/ITeS professionals stated that 60 percent of them believe that rapid technology advancements are set to impact their careers by 2017-18.
Around 62 percent believe that the impact will be due to automation, artificial intelligence and digital technologies. It also showed that more than 50 percent of IT industry professionals believe that future growth is in emerging and new technology areas like cloud computing, big data, cybersecurity, data science and mobile and a vast majority of them are keen to upgrade their skills. Around 35 per cent respondents want to up-skill with online courses over the next 6 months and digital marketing, big data and analytics are some popular domains professionals want to build their skills.
Changing technologies has opened big opportunities in cloud, big data, AI, that require skilled professionals. “In order to help the workforce, we are working with companies to help their employees adapt to the technological changes and still be relevant to the company's' needs through specialized skill sets,” said Krishna Kumar, Founder and CEO, Simplilearn.
Skilling is practical education that is relevant to the industry. "Things change so dynamically in the tech world that a piece of software took 300 lines to code can now be done in 15 lines. The workforce has to adapt to these changes. Also, robots are replacing human beings for a lot of repetitive tasks in tech. Up-skilling in such a scenario translates to learning how to manage the bots and not lose your job! Cloud computing, big data, analytics - these are three areas where lack of regular up-skilling can have suicidal consequences," says Lovleen Bhatia, Co Founder and CEO of Edureka - an interactive, online learning platform, adding that the only solution is for members of the workforce to become indispensable by up-skilling themselves voluntarily in order to stay relevant in the ever-changing landscape of today.
Clearly, reskilling is the way ahead and the emerging work force will have to adapt to new technologies at faster pace.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Students at Dunraven School in south London listened as Theresa May explained the audit
Theresa May has warned public services there will be "nowhere to hide" if they treat people differently on the basis of their race.
A new government website shows disparities in educational attainment, health, employment and treatment by police and courts between ethnicities.
The PM said institutions must "explain or change" any variations - but critics are demanding action from ministers.
Labour says government must accept its role in exacerbating injustice.
The figures cover a wide range of lifestyle indicators, including:
Black Caribbean pupils are permanently excluded from school three times as often as white British classmates
White British pupils on free school meals perform the worst at key stage two, with just 32% reaching the expected level
Indian, Pakistani and white people are more likely to own their own homes than black and Bangladeshi individuals
Unemployment among black, Asian and minority ethnic people is nearly double that of white Britons
Rates of smoking are highest in the mixed and white ethnic groups
Just over half of white adults ate five portions of fruit and vegetables a day, compared with a third of black adults
"People who have lived with discrimination don't need a government audit to make them aware of the scale of the challenge," Mrs May said.
"This audit means that for society as a whole - for government, for our public services - there is nowhere to hide."
Among those contacting the BBC, Shaneil, from Moss Side, Manchester, said: "It shouldn't matter where you come from or your race. You should be equal, you should be able to do anything you want to do.
"We need more different ethnicities to be in power as well."
Joseph G Jones, of the Gypsy Council, said the government was failing its Romani and Traveller communities with "multi-discrimination" across people's lifetimes.
"The younger generations shouldn't have to put up with endemic ongoing discrimination - for the time being there is little light at the end of the tunnel," they said.
And Victoria Stevens, a Ukrainian who has lived in the UK for 18 years told the BBC they had no problem in applying for jobs, as they had a mechanical engineering degree, plenty of work experience, and their late husband's English surname.
But they added: "However, when it came to career progression, I found that a British candidate would get a promotion above me, every time."

Almost all the data released on 'Ethnicity Facts and Figures' is already publicly available and no new data was commissioned for the audit.
Analysis: By BBC home editor Mark Easton
This audit is a giant nudge to change behaviour on issues of race inequality. The odd thing is that the project is not a government trying to nudge the people. It is a government trying to nudge itself.
The prime minister has dedicated their premiership to fighting burning injustices and says they are determined to shine a light on disparities between different racial groups in the UK on a range of areas - health, education, job prospects, housing and so on.
A focus on the many and often troubling differences is - of course - no bad thing, but people might well wonder why we need a public website to get Whitehall departments to take an interest.
And given that ministers have known about these "troubling" and "shocking" disparities for years or even decades, why does it take a prime ministerial nudge to get them to take action?
Read more from Mark
Critics from ethnic minority backgrounds, including former deputy London mayor Munira Mirza, in a letter to The Times, said the "crude and tendentious" approach of comparing the data in the website risked "promoting a grievance culture and policies that harm the communities they aspire to help".
They said prejudice had declined "markedly" and while injustice must be challenged, there were often many underlying factors to explain differences.
Communities Secretary Sajid Javid denied it would drive a grievance culture but would help identify disparities.
"There are hundreds of thousands of British Pakistani women and Bangladeshi women who don't speak proper English, who don't speak English at all," they told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
"That might be through choice in some cases, it might be a cultural issue. But that is a big issue because that does then hold those women back from the employment market and other opportunities."
May 'exacerbated problems'
Labour's Dawn Butler said government cuts to services had disproportionately affected women, ethnic minorities, disabled and older people.
Speaking in the House of Commons, they said the PM had "done nothing but exacerbate the problems".
"Far from tackling the burning injustices she's added fuel to the fire. We need solutions and a sustained effort to really tackle burning injustices, talking shop's just not going to cut it."
Although the audit does not focus on government policies, Mrs May is launching a number of measures to combat the differences discovered.
They include Department for Work and Pensions "hotspots" to help people from ethnic minorities get jobs, and traineeships for 16-24 year-olds.
Under the plans, the Ministry of Justice will also adopt recommendations from the Lammy Review, including demanding that prisons have performance indicators to assess how inmates are treated and how representative their workforce is.
David Lammy MP told BBC News the data was "not all doom and gloom" and "some progress" had been made.
"The truth is you can't rest back on your laurels, you can't leave race and issues of class and poverty off the agenda. Some of this has been left off the agenda over the last seven years so we've fallen backwards."
Of the 29 helicopters, 12 were already grounded duo to lack of parts for maintenance. One more was lost after it crashed into a building due to bad weather conditions. The Ministry of Defence reported the corrosion problems to the US as soon as they were spotted, in March 2015. Despite the measures they were advised to take, the problem was not eliminated, resulting in the dispatch of a Boeing team, according to Major General Huang Kuo-ming's statements.
The company's engineers are conducting a detailed inspection which is expected to be concluded next month. According to the Taiwanese officials, the problem could be due to the country's wet and hot climate, the monsoons and the fact that they carry the ocean's salty water towards the inland. The climate conditions could have an effect at the tail rotor gearboxes which are made of aluminum-magnesium alloy. Another factor could be any inconsistencies in the maintenance procedures.
Taiwan procured 30 Boeing AH-64E Apache Guardian attack helicopters in 2008 and received the first six in 2013. The total value of the contract was USD6.4 billion including 1,000 AGM-114L Hellfire missiles, 66 M299 Hellfire Longbow missile launchers, support, maintenance and crew training.

Federal wildlife officials plan to dispatch armed bird specialists into Pacific Northwest forests starting this fall to shoot one species of owl in an effort to protect another that is threatened with extinction.
“The government, which during the 80s, basically stopped logging to protect owls, is now going out to shoot them,” explains confused Ross and Burbank Show host Dave Ross.
The Northwest Forest Plan, which cut logging by 90 percent, has done a good job of providing habitat for the spotted owl. But the owls' numbers have continued to slide.
The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service on Tuesday released a final environmental review of an experiment to see if killing a species called barred owls will allow Northern spotted owls to reclaim territory they've been driven out of over the past half-century.
Barred owls are bigger, more aggressive, and less picky about food. They started working their way across the Great Plains in the early 1900s, and by 1959 were in British Columbia. Barred owls now cover the spotted owl's range, in some places outnumbering them as much as 5-to-1.
After years and years of trying to increase spotted owl numbers, co-host Luke Burbank thinks maybe it's just time to call this one.
“I don't want to sound uncaring, but there's a point at which we might have to say to the spotted owl, ‘You're pretty bad at being alive, and we just can't help you anymore,'” says Luke Burbank.
Ross agrees, saying perhaps the spotted owl is just one of those species at the wrong end of natural selection. Not being too familiar with bird species, they can't see why wildlife officials would favor one species over the other.
“They're both extremely owlish and they do owly things,” says Ross.
Also, how many of these battles do we plan to engage in with nature? In the case of the spotted owl, Dave points out we've already intervened and the species still can't seem to get it together.
“We stopped the logging and now nature is taking its course and we don't like the course that nature is taking. This is like us trying to interfere with every country that's having a revolution. Now we've got to tell nature which owl it should save.”
The proposal calls for killing 3,603 barred owls in four study areas in Oregon, Washington, and Northern California over the next four years.
The plan is expected to cost about $3 million and requires a special permit under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act, which prohibits killing non-game birds.
The cost raises more questions for Dave. The way they see it, this thing shouldn't be costing any money, but could be a moneymaker.
“Three a million to kill 3,600 owls, that's $1,000 an owl. I bet there are hunters who would pay for a license to bag a few owls. Why don't we just let hunters buy licenses and just make some money off it?”
Neither the timber industry nor the Audubon Society support the plan.
Bob Sallinger, conservation director for the Audubon Society of Portland, says saving the spotted owl is of paramount importance, but the focus must remain on protecting habitat.
“To move forward with killing barred owls without addressing the fundamental cause of spotted owl declines, from our perspective, is not acceptable,” they say.
The Department of Fish and Wildlife says unless barred owls are brought under control, the spotted owl, in coming decades, might disappear from Washington's northern Cascade Range and Oregon's Coast Range, where the barred owl incursion has been greatest.
Owl shootings are expected to begin in the Washington area in the Cascade Range in Cle Elum in the fall of 2014. Other hunting areas will be in the Oregon Coast Range, in the Klamath Mountains south of Roseburg, and at the Hoopa Valley Indian Reservation in Northern California.
Scientists will monitor whether spotted owls move back into areas where barred owls have been killed. The four study areas add up to 1,207 square miles, which amounts to 0.05 percent of the northern spotted owl's range.

The Democratic battle to replace John Conyers John James ConyersDemocrats seek cosponsors for new 'Medicare for all' bill Virginia scandals pit Democrats against themselves and their message Women's March plans 'Medicare for All' day of lobbying in DC MORE Jr. (D-Mich.) atop the House Judiciary Committee will be settled this week, a contest hinging on factors of seniority and gender as much as policy.
Both Reps. Jerrold Nadler (N.Y.) and Zoe Lofgren Zoe Ellen LofgrenFeminine hygiene products to be available to House lawmakers using congressional funds Whitaker takes grilling from House lawmakers Democrats launch ‘drain-the-swamp' agenda MORE (Calif.), the leading candidates to replace Conyers as the committee's top Democrat, are veteran lawmakers from powerhouse states with long and consistent track records supporting liberal causes.
“We're both good Democrats,” said Lofgren.
But in making their final pitch, the two lawmakers are carving out key distinctions each say makes them a better fit for today's unique political environment.

Nadler, the sitting ranking member following Conyers's resignation over sexual misconduct allegations, is touting their seniority and decades-long focus on constitutional issues, which could prove a boon to the Democrats if a “constitutional crisis,” in Nadler's description, emerges from the special counsel investigation into Russia's election meddling. Impeachment is among the host of consequential issues falling under Judiciary's domain.
“We are quite possibly headed into a major constitutional crisis … and we need our best constitutional lawyer and constitutional expert at the helm of the committee,” Nadler told The Hill in an interview. “And I'm widely recognized as such.”
Lofgren, meanwhile, is trumpeting their expertise in immigration law, a hot-button issue as Trump and the Democrats do battle over the fate of “Dreamers.”
They have also suggested that the recent wave of sexual harassment allegations makes the moment ripe for a woman to ascend on a committee that hasn't had a female chair or ranking member since its inception in 1813. It is, they said in a letter to colleagues, “a watershed moment in the nation's history.”
“For 204 years, we've had an unbroken stream of male leadership on both sides of the aisle. We have this opportunity to change it,” Lofgren told The Hill last week in their office on Capitol Hill.
“Everybody across the country is wondering — where's the female leadership in business, in media, in government?” they added. “The fact that the opening was because of allegations of sexual harassment obviously makes the issue even more acute.”
The Democrats will decide the winner by a closed ballot on Wednesday.
Both candidates bring a wealth of experience to the race. The 70-year-old Nadler, in their 13th term, has sat on every Judiciary subcommittee over the years, rising to become the top Democrat on three of those panels. The 12-term Lofgren, who turns 70 on Thursday, has held the top spot on Judiciary's immigration subpanel for a decade and also chaired the Ethics Committee for a term.
Given the similarities, Wednesday's vote may prove a referendum on a seniority system that many Democrats — including party leaders and influential groups like the Congressional Black Caucus (CBC) — have historically fought to maintain.
“That's significant,” said Rep. Bobby Scott Robert (Bobby) Cortez ScottTop Dems blast administration's proposed ObamaCare changes Virginia congressional delegation says it's 'devastated by' Richmond Turmoil The Hill's 12:30 Report: AOC unveils Green New Deal measure | Trump hits Virginia Dems | Dems begin hearings to get Trump tax returns MORE (D-Va.), ranking member of the Education Committee and an influential voice in the CBC.
Still, the House Democratic Caucus has grown younger in recent cycles, and there's a growing appetite among the newer members to climb more quickly through the ranks of power — a dynamic that could act to dilute the weight of seniority as a deciding influence.
“Seniority is a factor, but when 60 percent of our caucus has been here six years or less, I don't think it's the factor that it used to be,” said Rep. Raúl Grijalva (D-Ariz.), ranking member of the House Natural Resources Committee and head of the Progressive Caucus.
Since Conyers's departure in the face of sexual harassment allegations, Nadler has led the Democratic charge against the Trump administration as it defends itself amid a series of investigations related to Russia's meddling in the 2016 presidential election. In recent weeks, he's been the presiding Democrat as the Judiciary Committee heard testimony from Attorney General Jeff Sessions Jefferson (Jeff) Beauregard SessionsTrump says they haven't spoken to Barr about Mueller report Ex-Trump aide: Can't imagine Mueller not giving House a ‘roadmap' to impeachment Rosenstein: My time at DOJ is 'coming to an end' MORE and FBI Director Christopher Wray.
“People think I did very well,” they said.
But Lofgren is downplaying the notion that the distant possibility of impeachment proceedings against Trump should dictate who replaces Conyers on the committee. While touting their own expertise on the subject — she's the only member of Congress to have participated in both the Nixon and Clinton impeachment proceedings — she's highlighting their immigration bona fides.
“None of us knows what's going to happen, and to assume that there would ever be an impeachment inquiry is way premature. We have no idea, so I'm not focusing on that,” they said. “I am focusing on my background as someone who could write an immigration bill.”
Nadler, responding to Lofgren's calls for women's empowerment, is promoting their own track record as a longtime defender of women's rights, a record that recently earned them an endorsement in the race from abortion rights group NARAL.
“I cannot change my sex, obviously, but I have been a leading and passionate advocate for all women's rights, the right to choose, etc., for the last 30 years,” they said.
Heading into the vote, Democratic leaders are taking pains to stay neutral — at least publicly — choosing to extol the virtues of both candidates without taking sides.
“They are both very bright, very insightful, very judicious,” Rep. Steny Hoyer Steny Hamilton HoyerHouse to vote on background check bills next week Why Omar's views are dangerous On unilateral executive action, Mitch McConnell was right — in 2014 MORE (Md.), the Democratic whip, said last week. “They will both be excellent leaders, whichever one is chosen.”
Hailing from San Francisco, House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi Nancy Patricia D'Alesandro PelosiHouse to push back at Trump on border Governors bullish on infrastructure after Trump talks Pelosi attends signing of New York's new 'red flag' gun control bill MORE (Calif.) shares Lofgren's regional interests but has also declined to weigh in. Lofgren, for their part, said they haven't asked Pelosi to do so.
“I do think I need to make this case on my own,” they said.
The race bears striking similarities to the 2014 fight between Reps. Frank Pallone Jr. Frank Joseph PalloneOvernight Health Care — Presented by National Taxpayers Union — Trump bans abortion providers from family planning program | White House doesn't back GOP governor on drug imports | HHS declines to provide witnesses for family separations hearing Overnight Health Care — Presented by National Taxpayers Union — Top Dems call for end to Medicaid work rules | Chamber launching ad blitz against Trump drug plan | Google offers help to dispose of opioids Top Dems call for end to Medicaid work rules after 18,000 lose coverage in Arkansas MORE (N.J.) and Anna Eshoo Anna Georges EshooFemale Dems see double standard in Klobuchar accusations Dems urge regulators to reject T-Mobile, Sprint merger House Dems to mull bills to overturn Trump ObamaCare actions MORE (Calif.) for the top Democratic spot on the powerful House Energy and Commerce Committee.
That contest, which also featured two well-respected veterans with near-identical policy positions, was widely viewed as a proxy battle between Pelosi, who backed their Bay Area ally in Eshoo, and Hoyer, who supported the more senior Pallone. Pallone prevailed by 10 votes.
Both candidates — and party leaders — are hoping to avoid that divisiveness this time around.
“It's not a slash-and-burn campaign, let's put it that way,” Lofgren said.
That dynamic has not been missed by rank-and-file members, who say they're happy not to be thrust into the midst of another dragged out, public display of party disunity. Grijalva said compared to the Pallone-Eshoo fight, the Nadler-Lofgren race is “less sanctimonious.”
“That's very helpful — for everybody,” they said.
In the final blitz for support, both Nadler and Lofgren have huddled with the members of the CBC, Congressional Hispanic Caucus and the New Democrats, and similar meetings are scheduled this week with the Blue Dogs and the Progressive Caucus.

The Miami Heat will not hold its annual charity golf tournament at President Trump Donald John TrumpHouse committee believes it has evidence Trump requested putting ally in charge of Cohen probe: report Vietnamese airline takes steps to open flights to US on sidelines of Trump-Kim summit Manafort's attorneys say they should get less than 10 years in prison MORE's Doral golf course, near Miami, this year.
A spokesperson for the NBA team told The Washington Post that the tournament will be at a different course in 2018, after having it at Trump's course for four straight years, but did not give a specific reason for the change.

“We're not getting into it,” the spokesperson told the Post.
The Heat is one of at least five professional sports teams who have moved their golf tournaments from Trump clubs, according to the Post.
Trump has been feuding with NFL teams over players that kneel rather than stand as a form of protest during the national anthem. Their ire has also extended to some NBA players, like Golden State Warriors player Stephen Curry, who Trump “disinvited” to the White House after Curry expressed reluctance to attend a traditional visit with the championship team.
Several professional sports teams have also stopped staying in Trump hotels, citing the president's divisiveness.

The American economy is growing. It's not roaring, but it's growing, and at a good pace.
According to the latest figures from the Bureau of Economic Analysis, real US gross domestic product (GDP) rose at an annualized rate of 2.8% in the third quarter of 2013, which covered July through September.
For comparison, the long-term trend rate in US GDP growth is about 2% per year.
This year's fast GDP growth underlines one of the great myths of economic statistics: the myth that growth benefits everyone, or at least most people.
Under the great economics assumption of “ceteris paribus” growth does benefit everyone. “Ceteris paribus” is Latin for “everything else the same.”
If the overall structure of the economy remains the same, then higher GDP means more income for everyone.
Unfortunately, the overall structure of the economy has been changing rapidly in recent years, and not for the better.
Corporate revenues may be increasing slowly as the economy grows by two or three percent per year, but corporate profits are exploding. So are executive salaries and bonuses.
We are witnessing a massive shift in the structure of the economy away from benefits for ordinary workers and retirees in favor of a small number of relatively rich and powerful people.
The latest economic statistics illustrate this. The Bureau of Economic Analysis doesn't collect data on income distribution (why not?) but it does collect data on after-tax disposable income.
After-tax disposable income has been rising at a rate of around 4.5% this year, or about 3.5% after adjusting for inflation.
Yet we know from Census Bureau data that the median income — the income of the typical person — has not increased at all for several years. In fact, real median income is still more than 7% below 2007 levels. That's despite the fact that the economy as a whole has now bounced back to well above 2007 output levels.
Economic growth? Yes. Ceteris paribus? No. Everything else has not remained the same. The economy is bigger than it was in 2007, but it's a different economy.
And let's remember: the 2007 economy was nothing to write home about. In fact, the 2000s were already one of the worst decades in economic history before the recession hit. We only forget that because the 2010s are shaping up to be even worse.
But the US economy is growing. It's been growing all along. Growth is not the problem.
Economic structure is the problem. Or in a word: inequality. Ordinary Americans haven't had a raise (in real, inflation-adjusted terms) since 1972. Instead, all of America's economic growth for forty years has gone to an elite minority.
The myths of economic statistics all come down to the fact that the purpose of the economy isn't to generate profit. The purpose of the economy is to serve the people who depend on it. When it doesn't, maybe it's time to consider a different kind of economy. One that works for everyone.
North Whitehall golf course vandalized, carts pushed into creeks
A $2,000 reward has been offered for information leading to the arrest of those involved in the crime.
Vandals broke into the Iron Lakes Country Club in North Whitehall Township early Monday and damaged some golf golf carts, a few of which were dumped in a moat at the 18th hole, police said.
Ten to 15 people trespassed between 1 and 4 a.m. onto the country club property, where they pried open a building and removed 21 golf carts, which then were scattered around the course.
One cart has not been found, police said. Another turned up on Shankweiler Road, about a mile west of the golf course, police said.
A few carts were pushed into ponds, creeks and the 18th hole moat. Damage also was done to parts of the country club grounds.
Police said they did not know which direction the vandals went when they left Iron Lakes.
Anyone with information on the crime can contact Trooper Timothy Cutshaw at 610-861-2026 or the Lehigh Valley Crimestoppers at 1-800-426-TIPS. Callers could be eligible for the reward, but they do not have to give their names, police said.

BTS is the hottest act in K-Pop for good reason. The seven-member group's forward-thinking mix of hip-hop and club beats transcends the traditional borders of K-Pop, winning them a global following. And that's not hyperbole. Their sophomore LP, Wings, sold over a million copies around the world and debuted at number 26 on the Billboard 200. The hitmakers also made chart history earlier this year when “Spring Day” cracked the top 10 on the US iTunes download chart. Oh, and they sold out an American tour in minutes.
Korea's gift to pop performed for 18,000 fans at the Honda Center in Anaheim on Sunday night (April 2), showcasing their frenetic choreography and eclectic influences. The band's broad appeal was reflected in the diverse crowd. There were people of all ages and races at the venue, covered from head-to-toe in BTS merchandise. While they had little in common on the surface, there seemed to be an unspoken code that involved screaming hysterically at every available opportunity and frantically waving torches, phones or any other light source. It made for an electric, feverish atmosphere.
The surprisingly long set, which stretched on for two hours, began with furious banger “Not Today.” It was clear from the get-go that BTS didn't come to play. They immediately launched into a dizzying dance routine, spinning around the stage in tight formation. It was a reminder of how sloppy many western acts have become at performing. Not only was every step perfectly timed, the group's choreography was accentuated with clever use of lighting and glossy projections. There were no props to speak of, but that would have only diminished the sleek presentation.

As a K-Pop novice, I was impressed by how the concert allowed each member to show off their respective strengths via solo spots. Rap Monster drew deafening applause for “Reflection,” while Suga left the girls sitting next to me (literally) crying and shaking after their moody rendition of “First Love.” My favorite solo belonged to Jimin. The blond Pop God delivered a powerful vocal and some of the night's best dance moves while performing “Lie.” I found the sub-groups a little harder to follow.
Between solos and group numbers, BTS would split into a quartet (Jin, V, Jimin and Jungkook) for ballads and a trio (Rap Monster, Suga and J-Hope) for hip-hop songs. It definitely kept things interesting, but was also a little confusing at times. However, the hardcore K-Pop stars were in their element with the constantly changing line-ups and lapped up every new formation. For me, the most exciting moments came when the guys came together and did their thing. They are individually brilliant, but still somehow more than a sum of their parts.
As for highlights, the intricate choreography and elaborate production of “Fire” stands out as did their high-energy performance of catchy banger, “I Need U.” The superstars closed the show with “Blood, Sweat And Tears” – three things the A.R.M.Y. spent during the show. (Ok, there was no blood). After an encore, BTS returned and wound up the show with recent hit, “Spring Day.” The Wings Tour is the perfect introduction to the professionalism and pageantry of K-Pop. BTS is in a league of their own and the world is starting to realize it.

In a landmark push for LGBT equality, President Barack Obama's administration called on every public school district in the country on Friday to let students use the bathroom that matches their gender identity or face loss of federal funds, and potentially lawsuits. This comes on the heels of the nationwide controversy surrounding North Carolina's HB 2, which requires transgender people to use the bathroom that matches their sex at birth.
Reactions on social media to the move were impassioned and varied. Even within the same state or school district, for every educator or administrator championing inclusivity and compassion on the matter, there is another challenging such directives as unsafe, sacrilegious, or as unwanted government overreach. But it's students who are caught in the middle.
Sage Burge, a 17-year-old trans senior living in Lexington, Kentucky, says he's seen positive and negative reactions to the edict inside their school, Paul Dunbar High School. On Facebook, Burge recently posted a screenshot from the Instagram account of the school's P.E. teacher, Jason Duncan, from May 11. “Jesus made you and me in their image,” the teacher's post reads. “You are either a man or a woman [sic]. There is no transgender. There is no in between.”
Facebook
The teacher's Instagram account is private—his bio reads “Romans 1:16”—but Burge told Vocativ that the health teacher preaches “about God in class all the time and allows students to follow them on their personal social media accounts.” Burge alerted their school's county on Facebook about the Instagram post.
“I do understand people can have opinions. But for a teacher that follows students and allows students to follow him, they should not be allowed to post these kinds of things where trans or nonbinary or anyone that doesn't follow the gender norms of man and woman can see,” Burge wrote in a post on their school district's Facebook page.
That wasn't Burge's only related interaction with the teacher. Back in September, Burge said that they were leaving the gym to go to the bathroom to change one day when the following incident occurred:
“When I was leaving [Duncan] said ‘ladies stay here,' because they didn't know me yet. When I came back my friend told me they told them that I'm a guy, and to use guy pronouns when speaking to or about me, and they pulled out their cross necklace and walked away without another word.”
The PE teacher didn't respond to Vocativ's request to confirm Burge's story.
While such anecdotes are often of a piece with our expectations for small Southern towns resistant to change, the Lexington health teacher may be an outlier. Burge says if other teachers feel the same way about transgender identity, they never hears about it. “None of the other teachers really express their personal beliefs to students because they're not supposed to,” they said.
And the rest of the school staff has been supportive. When Burge realized they aren't comfortable using the boys or girls bathroom during their transition, they say they asked the principal, Betsy Rains, if they could use the staff bathroom instead, at least until they began hormone replacement therapy in a few months. Rains immediately said yes.
“She told me that because I was uncomfortable with the other restrooms, I had permission to use the staff restrooms,” Burge told Vocativ. “She's always been more than happy to help with whatever I've needed and with my friends. She's always super helpful when people need it.”
A spokesperson for the Fayette County School Board, Lisa Deffendall, told Vocativ the county is “already in compliance” with Obama's directive to let students use the bathrooms that match their identity. The school also did not respond to requests for comment.
This patchwork of support seems to mirror the reactions that are cropping up elsewhere. In Texas, Port Neches-Groves Superintendent Rodney Cavness told local news that Obama's letter would not be well received, using a frequently cited conservative point of opposition to the law—that it's unsafe.
“He ain't my President and they can't tell me what to do. That letter is going straight to the paper shredder. I have 5 daughters myself and I have 2,500 girls in my protection. Their moms and dads expect me to protect them. And that is what I am going to do.”
Still, they said as far as following the directive. “There are accommodations that can be made short of this.”
In Nashville, another educator came out to say the danger angle is unfounded. “This is completely blown out of proportion by the far right,” Erik Huth, head of the Metropolitan Nashville Education Association, told Vocativ. “There is no evidence to suggest that denying transgender children the right to access a restroom aligned with their gender identity creates a danger for other students. However, denying access to restrooms creates hardships transgender students. All of the restroom-related violence I have ever heard of in public schools has been committed by those of one biological sex on others of the same biological sex.”
Still, there are policies, and there is the real-world practice of teachers in classrooms. Students took to Twitter to report conversations in their schools and classes about transgender rights. One student, Rebecca, wrote that, in order to kick off a conversation about transgender rights, their teacher wrote on the board, “Mr. Jenkins now identifies as a woman?”
my teacher wrote this on the board and asked our class about transgenders using the bathroom they identify with – pic.twitter.com/n4C9BRHTEv — Rebecca (@toeptx) May 13, 2016
– and everyone in the class began agreeing with them and saying they shouldn't be allowed to. So I called them out. — Rebecca (@toeptx) May 13, 2016
They said I was trying to “impose my beliefs on others” bc I said half the class was bigots. Then they asked me who I thought was a bigot – — Rebecca (@toeptx) May 13, 2016
– and I called them out. He's been trying to pull this shit all year. I'm furious. — Rebecca (@toeptx) May 13, 2016
Rebecca then debates whether to simply walk out or not, because, after all, she's in math class, and “What does this even have to do with math?”
Sharise Johnson, the managing director for national communications and engagement at Teach For America, told Vocativ in an email that the organization strongly supports safe spaces for all students, especially transgendered ones. “We are deeply concerned and disappointed any time members of our community feel unsafe or marginalized,” they wrote. “In this moment, we particularly want to affirm our commitment to creating safe and welcoming classrooms and schools for members of the LGBTQ community.”
In spite of the backlash and resistance and the actions of teachers such as Jason Duncan, students like Sage Burge say they still feel lucky to have support at all in such a climate. “It could most certainly be a lot worse,” Burge told Vocativ. “I'd say I'm one of the luckiest trans high school students to have the support at school and in my family that I do.”
Editor's note: SMU officially announced Monday that it will sell beer and wine at its home football games.
---
Southern Methodist University will kick off beer sales at football games this fall after strong sales at campus basketball games.
The university will expand beer sales to Ford Stadium concourses and plans to start sales at the first home game on Sept. 20 against Texas A&M, SMU athletic spokesperson Brad Sutton said. Alcoholic beverages are already available in stadium suites.
“We were deliberate in setting the plan for Moody [Coliseum], and it was safe and successful, so this process will also be carefully designed and vetted before we roll it out,” Sutton said.
SMU began selling beer in January at Moody Coliseum during men's basketball games. The university made $100,000 or more from the sales, according to a USA Today report.
Sutton declined Tuesday to release sales figures.
SMU is one of several dozen universities that's looked to alcoholic beverages to boost crowds and make money at sports events. Kansas State University and West Virginia University already sell alcoholic beverages. The University of Texas began a pilot program in February for beer and wine sales at basketball, baseball and softball games.
SMU, Highland Park and University Park police said they did not see a spike in noise complaints or drunken revelry because of basketball game beer sales. Only one person was cited for an alcohol-related offense, SMU police Chief Rick Shafer said.
Beer sales were a hit among fans, who came out in larger numbers during SMU's winning season, Sutton said. Average attendance at men's basketball games nearly doubled, they said.
Sutton said SMU is still finalizing the rules and procedures for football beer sales. At Moody Coliseum, beer was on tap at kiosks in arena concourses. Students age 21 and older were required to show a valid, government-issued ID outside of the arena and wear a wristband. They were limited to three beers per game.
All other fans were required to show IDs to vendors and were limited to two beers per transaction. Beer sales began one hour before the game and ended when 15 minutes remained on the second-half game clock.
Fans paid $6 for a 12-ounce plastic cup of Bud Light or Miller Lite or $8 for Michelob Ultra or Shiner.
Defense Secretary Jim Mattis is crediting changes in tactics ordered by President Trump for increasing the pressure on the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, and leaving the beleaguered fighters with no avenue of escape.
"He directed a tactical shift from shoving ISIS out of safe locations in an attrition fight to surrounding the enemy in their strongholds so we can annihilate ISIS," Mattis said Friday during a Pentagon briefing on the counter-ISIS campaign.
Mattis said that by making sure foreign fighters can't get away, or return to their home countries, "We don't simply transplant this problem from one place to another."
Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Joseph Dunford pointed to two other changes that came as result of the president's direction to accelerate the defeat of ISIS, including allowing U.S. advisers to accompany partner forces closer to the front lines, and the decision to arm Syrian Kurds to facilitate the liberation of Raqqa, the Islamic State's self-proclaimed capital in Syria.
The Pentagon says since the campaign against ISIS began in 2014, the terror group has lost more than 20,000 square miles of territory and 4.1 million people have been freed from the brutal grip of ISIS rule.
Mattis and Dunford also disputed reports that suggested that by waiting until now to approve a Pentagon plan to arm Syrian Kurds, the Trump administration in any way delayed the siege of Raqqa.
The only thing that has delayed the coming offensive, said Mattis, was the vagaries of the battlefield.
Mattis said the defeat of ISIS is a foregone conclusion.
"West Mosul, in accordance with tactics changed by President Trump, is surrounded, and our Iraqi partners are in a stiff fight," Mattis said. "There is no escape for ISIS."
On Thursday (March 12), NASA is set to launch the Magnetospheric Multiscale mission, or MMS, to study a phenomenon known "magnetic reconnection." These energetic events, sometimes referred to as "explosions in space," are the driver of solar weather. (NASA)
(CBS SF) — NASA is launching a fleet of spacecraft Thursday to investigate the mystery behind a cosmic phenomenon in the Earth's magnetic field just as the sun unleashed its first massive flare of the year.
The Magnetospheric Multiscale mission, or MMS, will be the first-ever mission to study magnetic reconnection — the explosive event that can send powerful bursts of particles hurling toward Earth with the potential to damage satellites, power grids and people.
This little understood process is also responsible for the auroras near the Earth's pole.
One day before NASA plans to launch four satellites to help scientists understand what triggers this magnetic reconnection, the sun unleashed a strong Earth-directed solar flare.
NASA's Solar Dynamics Observatory captured video of the X-class solar flare, the strongest category of sun storms possible, right as it erupted.
However, the beta-gamma-delta magnetic field this particular sunspot developed is unstable to the kind of explosive magnetic reconnection NASA will study using its MMS fleet, according to Space Weather News.
It's unknown if the flare will disrupt the MMS mission this NASA video explains in detail.
“[MMS] is going to actually fly in Earth's magnetosphere, this protective magnetic environment around the Earth,” Jeff Newmark, interim director of NASA's heliophysics division, said in a Feb. 25 briefing. “We're using this environment around the Earth as a natural laboratory. Rather than building one on Earth, we're going to where magnetic reconnection actually occurs in space so we can understand it.”

You can watch the MMS satellite launch Thursday, with NASA's webcast beginning at 5 p.m. PST (8 p.m. EST). Liftoff is set for 7:44 p.m. PST (10:44 p.m. EST).
Gavin Badger will become just the fifth referee to reach the milestone of 300 NRL matches when they officiate in the Penrith v Wests Tigers match at Pepper Stadium on Sunday.
Badger will be lead referee in the match, which will see them join Bill Harrigan, Col Pearce, Shayne Hayne and Steve Clark in the exclusive club.
"Gavin should be very proud of what they have done for the game as a match official," NRL Head of Football Brian Canavan said.
"The game has changed significantly over the years so for Gavin to evolve as they have through different refereeing models to remain one of the leading referees in the game is a wonderful achievement."
NRL General Manager of Officiating Tony Archer congratulated Badger on the milestone.
"Gavin is one of the hardest-working officials in the group and that sort of dedication is something all officials can aspire to," Mr Archer said.
"Officiating in the NRL Premiership is clearly challenging but Gavin has been able to remain at the top of their game for a long period of time.
"He is someone young referees can and should look up to."
Referees 300 Club:
Bill Harrigan (393)
Col Pearce (340)
Shayne Hayne (328)
Steve Clark (314)
The Los Angeles Times is reporting that prosecutors decided to add a hate crime enhancement to the premeditated murder charge against 14-year-old Brandon McInerney, who allegedly gunned down gay junior high school classmate Lawrence “Larry” King, 15, after investigators discovered a “trove” of neo-Nazi literature and drawings in McInerney's bedroom.
According to a court document filed by Senior District Attorney Maeve Fox earlier this week, the materials seized from McInerney's room included white supremacist literature and drawings concerning “a racist skinhead philosophy of the variety espoused by Tom Metzger, David Lane and others.”
McInerney is awaiting trial as an adult for the Feb. 12 murder of King, who was shot in the head in a classroom full of students at E.O. Green Junior High School. McInerney fled the scene after the shooting and was apprehended a few blocks away. Witnesses said that King, who had recently revealed that they were gay and started to wear make-up and jewelry, had a verbal confrontation with McInerney regarding King's sexual orientation the day before the killing.
McInerney's public defender explained that their client had the items only because they were researching a term paper on Adolf Hitler.
The accused killer turned 14, the legal cutoff for charging a juvenile as an adult in California, less than a month before the murder. They could face 50 years to life if convicted, plus one to three years for the hate crime enhancement.
The latest episode of Mob Talk Sitdown featuring mafia experts George Anastasia and Dave Schratwieser takes a closer look at the evidence against Philadelphia mafia boss Joseph Merlino.
The guys discuss the evidence and how it could effect Joey not only in this East Coast LCN Enterprise case but also any future indictments that could develop in Philly. Prosecutors recently released transcripts of a secretly recorded conversation by mob rat John Rubio between Joey Merlino and New York mafia capo Eugene Onofrio where Joey brags about how easy it is to kill someone. There are no murder charges in the current indictment but these tapes could certainly damage the character of Merlino at trial.
“Joey Merlino”
Prosecutors released the transcripts as a response to motions filed by the defense to have the charges against Merlino dropped. According to Anastasia and Schratwieser, there could be something brewing by the feds in Philadelphia and this tape could be even more damaging to Joey in a trial that included charges tied to some of the still unsolved mafia murders. At this point, the current NY case involves no violent crimes but the feds in Philadelphia would certainly like to build a larger case against the flamboyant Cosa Nostra boss. If a case is being built in Philly it could include not only Joey but also other members of the organized crime family there. In the NY indictments, the feds claimed that Merlino was actively working to rebuild the Philly mafia.
The East Coast La Cosa Nostra Enterprise case of which Merlino is a part of was severely weakened by an internal probe into the potential mishandling of a mob informant and key evidence leading to sweet plea deals for most of the defendants. Merlino decided to take the fight to the feds and refused to agree to any plea offers potentially forcing the feds to drop the charges. It now seems like the feds are willing and ready to take their shot at Joey in the courtroom regardless of the previous problems and their case could be bolstered if they have even more evidence contained in the remaining conversations recorded by Rubio which have yet to be released. The next hearing in the case is scheduled for the end of August for pre-trial motions and the actual trial has been moved to January of 2018.
Bradley Beal - Washington Wizards
I decided to make a roster with all the moves that were made since the draft. This roster is based on Kova's last update.
1) None of the cyberface files are mine... some of them are from champion's draft, some (Shved, Claver, Teletovic, Prigioni, Freeland, De Colo) are from the Euroleague and FIBA mode, some are made by tree55292 (Harkless, Fournier, Hamilton) also CFs for Hummel, Melo, Crowder, Sacre, Jenkins, James, Denmon were made by Kieran.
2) Almost all the rookies have their own portraits (well a few 2nd rounders don't). The portraits are based on the last update of the ESPN portraits by sasha104. I have made a few of the portraits myself (Davis, MKG, Waiters, Valanciunas, Rivers, Beal and a few more) and added a few that Asder had in their update.
3) All the contracts are updated(some players that are FA's are still with their respective teams and have a contract for 0$ as the requirement is for a team to have a 12 player roster…
The PC market has largely moved to digital sales, thanks in part to aggressive down-sizing from chain stores like GameStop over the last decade, and partly because online PC gaming has been baked in for twenty years. There are, however, still people who like buying a game on physical media and prefer having a CD or disc with the game's content rather than relying on a digital service. In recent years, we've seen a trend where game developers don't bother putting the entire game on-disc, instead relying on the end user to download it from a secondary service. Now, Titanfall 2 is simply getting rid of physical media entirely. If you buy a physical boxed game, all you get is a code in a box. No disc, no nothing.
A leaked copy of the Titanfall 2 box art shows the game with a prominent “Download ONLY / No Disc Included” sticker, as you can see below:
There are several ways to look at this. On the one hand, boxed copies of games are a dying breed. Outside of collector or deluxe editions, which typically come with various value-adds of highly questionable value, few people collect boxed games anymore. The entire concept of the “Deluxe” or “Collector” edition is directly tied to both the sale of DLC and pre-order benefits (which is generally terrible for the industry and gamers), or just a money-grabbing mechanism designed to make a few bucks of profit off a games' most die-hard fans.
On the other hand, I've got to break with our sister site, Geek.com, which chalks this move up to difficulty with knowing what media to support and the publisher not wanting to pay to ship six or seven DVDs. DVD media isn't free, but the cost to manufacture a DVD is around 30 cents. It actually costs more to do the printing, box art, and packaging than it does to manufacture a single disc. Sure, the publisher is looking to save some dollars, but these are not unmanageable expenses. It's true that many new PCs don't have DVD drives, but virtually every PC has a flash drive. We've already seen some companies moving to shipping flash media instead of relying on optical discs. Microsoft, for one, ships Windows 10 on a USB drive, not a Blu-ray or DVD.
The most logical explanation for EA's decision to only ship a download code with Titanfall 2 is that the market for boxed sales has simply become too small to bother with. That's fine, as far as it goes; a company is allowed to make any decisions it wants as far as catering to customer preferences. But the handful of people still buying boxed media are likely buying it specifically because they don't want to deal with an online service. For these users, a download code obviates the entire point of owning the boxed copy in the first place.
Maybe it's time to kill boxed copies altogether. Once upon a time, opening a game box meant goodies like a map, an in-depth instruction manual, and other guides, feelies, or additions to the title. These days, you're lucky to get a jewel case with an on-disc PDF. Now, even the disc is going away. If there's no point to bundling an actual copy of the game in the box, there's no point to the box itself. Either have the guts to go 100% digital, or keep the current standard. Selling people a cardboard square of art and a slip of paper for $60 isn't going to please anyone.
A little over a year ago, Germany turned on the world's largest nuclear fusion reactor and faced sharp speculation over whether the machine could function as intended. Now, tests conducted by US and German researchers confirm that the experimental Wendelstein 7-X (W7-X) stellarator is indeed producing magnetic fields that make controlled nuclear reactions possible, and with a high degree of accuracy and incredibly low error rate. With these test results, new confidence and hope are spreading through the renewable energy industry, as nuclear fusion could be the key to ending fossil fuel dependence worldwide.
W7-X is the first of its kind to be put into regular operation. Its processes mimic those that occur on the sun, which is a natural nuclear fusion reactor (or “stellarator”). A team of researchers from the US and Germany worked together to test the stellarator after it went online in order to learn whether it is capable of producing the sort of magnetic fields necessary to trap scorching balls of plasma long enough for nuclear fusion to occur. And it is.
Related: Germany's Wendelstein 7-X stellarator passes new test, bringing us closer to nuclear fusion energy
The research team found that W7-X is generating magnetic fields just the way its design intended: strong, twisted, and 3D. “To our knowledge, this is an unprecedented accuracy, both in terms of the as-built engineering of a fusion device, and in the measurement of magnetic topology,” the researchers wrote in a report. Combined with an error rate less than one in 100,000, the tests conclude the W7-X stellarator has made history. It could become the first power plant on Earth to use little more than saltwater to create a safe, clean, long-lasting source of energy for generations to come.
The research results were recently published in the journal Nature Communications.

It is interesting how little the St. Louis Blues seem to be figuring into Stanley Cup prognostications, despite a 45-22-9 record that is tied for top in the Western Conference.
Whether it's a case of Blues fatigue or just plain mistrust, it is clear the past three seasons' first-round knockouts have left a stain on the reputation of a team that has had an absolutely wonderful season by all accounts.
Whatever the case, they're not the chosen ones, media-wise, entering this postseason.
Maybe that's fair. That's how it is. They don't get the benefit of the doubt until they prove it when it matters.
"It's fine by us," Blues captain David Backes said over the phone Monday. "We've been on the other side of that coin, where we've been picked and disappointed. Now, maybe we get to play that underdog role, lower expectations, just come in and, whoever we play, just get our game out there.
"If we're concerned or worried about [what] the writers are saying, no offense, we've got our minds in the wrong place."
The Blues are rolling with the playoffs around the corner. They have won 10 of their past 12 games, including a 4-0 shutout win Saturday at the NHL-leading Washington Capitals.
The Blues also get a key player back in forward Alexander Steen, who after being shelved for five weeks is slated to return Tuesday, when the Blues host the Colorado Avalanche.
Defensemen Jay Bouwmeester and Carl Gunnarsson remain out, however, and there's no indication of when exactly either will be back. That's par for the course for a Blues team that hasn't been completely healthy this season. They have survived injuries to the likes of Paul Stastny, Alex Pietrangelo, Kevin Shattenkirk, Jaden Schwartz and Patrik Berglund, as well as goalies Brian Elliott and Jake Allen. Many teams would have had their seasons derailed by that kind of injury list.
A big part of the Blues' success comes from the goaltending tandem of Jake Allen, left, and Brian Elliott. Christopher Hanewinckel/USA TODAY Sports
Because of all the injuries, when I asked a rival Western Conference general manager to share their insight on the Blues, they said it was hard to give a clear picture.
"I don't know anyone that has 'truly seen them,' since they have been a team that has endured so many injuries to top-end players and yet have found themselves where they are at the moment," the GM said. "They have been tested at virtually every position and have come out on top. Sure, they may have disappointed in the past, but if they can get healthy, they could be very dangerous. They probably relish the fact that everyone is not talking about them."
If goaltending has done the Blues in at times in past playoffs, it has absolutely saved their season this year. Elliott and Allen have formed one of the NHL's top goalie tandems, with the two combining to post shutouts in their last four games.
"The goalies have been out of this world," Backes said. "We've done a decent job in front of them, but they're making all the stops that they should be making and stealing a couple that they have really no business making. When you've got that kind of support and protection behind you, it frees you up to make a few more plays in front of them. And we're starting to see a few pucks in the net on the offensive side of things because of that."
Both goalies are feeding off each other. Head coach Ken Hitchcock hasn't named a playoff starter yet, but it's clear they trust either option, no matter what.
"They've been really consistent all year round," Backes said. "These guys right now are solid as a rock and calm and confident and working their butts off. That competition between them is healthy. It's not like they're tearing each other down. They're supportive of each other and the other guy's success. They're buying into the team-first attitude too. You just love seeing that throughout the whole group."
Backes, meanwhile, long the face of this franchise, is eligible to become an unrestricted free agent on July 1. One wonders whether their future is tied to whether the team finally gets over the playoff hump. I would argue many within the Blues organization are probably in the same camp that way; this is a big year.
"I mean, it has the potential for that," Backes said when I proposed that theory. "I'm not making excuses or trying to put any light on our lack of getting out of the first round the last three years, but we've played darn good teams. We've had some adversity. We haven't got the job done, and that's on us.
"The potential is there for 'Let's blow this up' and not be satisfied with any of the hard work that's being done or the success that we've had. But I don't know that's an extremely rational thought from just how difficult the whole league is, really, with the cap and the parity from top to bottom. But the Central Division and what we've been able to accomplish five years in a row in the playoffs, yes, we want to make that next step.
"Maybe if we don't get out of the first round, [we'll have] big changes. We need to focus on our task at hand. Somebody is going to have to make that decision once the chips have all settled and we figure out what's happened. We're hoping the situation is that we're going to have a big party and a parade, and everyone can wrap arms around each other, and everyone gets to stay put."
That's especially true in a year when so few people picked this team.
This is the story of a group of college students who moved to the Mojave Desert, bought a house, painted it white, and turned it into a makeshift lab. Then they went out to launch rockets.
Talking to Amogha Srirangarajan from Carbon Origins
But they ran into problems, when they launched their Neptune 2 rocket,
“Our rocket exploded, and we didn't know why, we needed a data logger …”
and because they're makers, and all the data loggers they could find were too expensive or just not right for the job, they went ahead and built their own.
The Phoenix 0.2.1 launch in the Mojave Desert
Their Apollo board is less than two square inches in size and is packed with sensors — eleven of them.
“We called it Apollo, because it has eleven sensors …”
The tiny six-layer board has an accelerometer, gyroscope, magnetometer, and GPS, and can measure temperature, pressure, humidity, light (both UV and IR), and it records audio. But the board also comes with Bluetooth LE and wi-fi onboard, an SD Card for logging data locally, LiPo battery management circuitry, and it has an OLED screen and a vibrating trackball. If you count them up, the Apollo has over 200 components, all packed onto that tiny two-square-inch board.
Carbon Origins talking at MakerCon in New York
Based around the same ARM Cortex-M3 chip as the Arduino Due, the board will be part of the Arduino at Heart program, and is completely open source. The board will ship with software making use of their own Arduino library that gives access to all of the onboard sensors. However the extra GPIO pins, not used by the onboard sensors, are exposed for use and Carbon Origins will be producing a series of smart shields to make use of those extra pins.
The board is on display here at Maker Faire in New York this weekend, and will be arriving on Kickstarter in the next month or so, and we'll be back talking to the Carbon Origins team when it does.
The grotesque images of rubbish-strewn Henderson Island, a remote and uninhabited Pacific coral atoll where millions of tonnes of plastic waste have washed up, sent shockwaves around the world. The sheer volume of plastics escaping into the environment mean that by 2050 there could be more plastic in our seas than fish. But how easily could we cut plastic out of our daily lives?
In June the Marine Conservation Society will launch its “plastic challenge”, asking us to give up single-use plastic for a day, a week or even the whole month. Guardian Money asked one Yorkshire family to track their plastic use for a week, then try the following week to cut it out as much as possible. The results indicate by how much we can reduce our plastic footprint – but also show the realistic limits to slashing our use, even among those keen to be as eco-friendly as possible.
Siobhan McCreadie, a 35-year-old social worker who lives in North Yorkshire, said they and their husband Andrew were “mindful” about their plastic consumption and made sure much of what they used didn't end up in landfill. “Andrew will unscrew things and pull things apart in order for them to go into the right places so they can be recycled properly,” they say.

Yet the couple are often left “very frustrated” about the amount of plastic they can't recycle. “My in-laws, in Scotland, have about five recycling bins and can throw toothbrushes and yoghurt pot lids in there, and it all gets taken away on a weekly basis and recycled. We can't recycle those kinds of things. We're not even able to recycle black plastic,” says Siobhan.
The McCreadies, who have two primary school-aged sons, took the plastic challenge for two weeks in May. They monitored the amount of plastic they threw away in the first week, dividing it into what could and could not be recycled, and said they were horrified by how much they had collected by the end of week one. “My non-recyclable pile of plastic was much bigger than my recyclable pile, and it really made me think that all this is just going to end up in a slag heap in the ground. It's just bonkers and really sad,” says Siobhan.
In the second week they swapped their usual online delivery for shopping at a local greengrocers and deli in the hope of cutting out or cutting down on plastic packaging. “I bought all our fresh food from them, and had to explain at the counter that I didn't want anything in plastic. But for some things it was unavoidable. For example, although I bought the cheese from the deli, it came wrapped in clingfilm. And the blueberries, strawberries and raspberries still came in plastic punnets.”
This is just going to end up in a slag heap in the ground. It's just bonkers and really sad
The McCreadies cut out some weekly staples like bottles of fizzy water to reduce plastic consumption. Other times they made things from scratch. “Recently I'd bought a couple of ready-made soups that had been on offer, so instead of doing that I made my own, as I didn't want to have the plastic carton in my house,” Siobhan says. “Also, while shopping my boys saw a packet of Scotch pancakes and asked if they could have some, but because of the packaging I had to say no. So, I went home and made them some.”
There were other ways the McCreadies reduced their plastic usage during that second week. They avoided buying a whole chicken in a plastic tray wrapped in clingfilm; put plates over leftover food in the fridge instead of using clingfilm; bought whole fruits instead of the versions sold in plastic tubs; and planted herbs from seeds to save buying already-grown pots from the supermarket. Siobhan even eschewed using makeup remover because it was in a plastic bottle.
However, they said cutting out some essential items was just too difficult. “I could have bought a bar of soap instead of handwash that came with a pump. It lasts longer, is way cheaper and is eco-friendly. Yet in the past the boys have ended up dropping it and sliding it around on the floor, plus I don't like the residue it leaves on the sink. I know it's ridiculous, and I feel terrible for saying it, but it is such a faff,” says Siobhan.

The plastic challenge has been tough, they admit, even for an environmentally conscious family. “I've literally been thinking about it all the time. Everything I've purchased or eaten I've had to check to see which parts of the packaging can be recycled or not. I've had to drive to separate places to avoid buying an item wrapped in plastic. It's been a really time-consuming process.”
All the effort, however, was worth it. Their piles of recyclable and nonrecyclable plastic went down by around a quarter. Yet there were still like-for-like plastic items that were just a lot smaller – such as the clingfilm on the cheese instead of a resealable plastic pouch, or the zip-up grape bag instead of a punnet.
Siobhan says those who live in a town or city may find it easier to substitute plastic due to better facilities. “There are shops in York, such as the one in Fishergate, that have enormous tubs of things like rice, cereal and nuts that you can scoop up and pour straight into your own containers, but supermarkets near me don't have that facility. So, in order for me to cut out that kind of plastic I'd have to drive to York – and then the eco idea goes out the window.”
Siobhan says they will continue to be more conscious and avoid, where possible, buying items wrapped in or contained in plastic. But they say avoiding single-use plastic completely would be impossible “unless you were to become a full-on hippy who just spends their whole time devoted to this – because it's a full-time job.”
Take the plastic challenge
The Marine Conservation Society's plastic challenge is not about living completely plastic-free, writes Patrick Collinson.
“These days that would be pretty near impossible,” the society admits. But it says we can all do more to give up single-use products like plastic bottles and bags, or ready meals packed in plastic. It offers a starting pack at Mcsuk.org, and its “How to pack in the plastic” tips include:
• Use soap bars instead of handwash.
• Retailer Lush has plastic-free toiletries including shampoos, conditioners, deodorant and toothpaste.
• Lidl has plastic-free rice and couscous.
• ScoopAway (Bristol) and Better Food sell toilet roll not packaged in plastic.
• Ecover sells five-litre refills of toilet cleaner, washing-up liquid and other household cleaning products.
• Home milk delivery will usually come in glass rather than plastic.
• The ModernHippieShop has recipes and cleaning products with the aim of being plastic-free.
• Use self-scan in supermarkets to put loose fruit and veg into reusable bags. Whole Foods Market sells loose nuts, fruit, muesli and couscous.
• Tea bags contain small amounts of plastic. Buy loose tea instead.

CHICAGO (CBS) — A school shooting drill planned for tomorrow in the far northwestern suburbs has many parents upset.
Cary Grove Drill Upsets Parents
According to a letter from Cary-Grove High School principal Jay Sargeant, there will be a code red drill at the school on Wednesday.
It will include somebody shooting blanks from a gun in the hallway “in an effort to provide our teachers and students some familiarity with the sound of gunfire.”
CBS 2's Derrick Blakley reports, during the drill, teachers will keep students in their rooms, lock their doors, and draw their curtains. Police will sweep the building, while someone will fire two shots – blanks – from a starter pistol.
Cary Police Chief Steven Casstevens said, “From the school's request, they want to let the students know what the sound of gunshot might be, should that occur in their school.”
But any gunfire at a school – even blanks – had some parents and students shaking their heads.
Parent Kassy Pinter said, “It's probably necessary to have the ‘code red' drill, but not really necessary to shoot the blanks in the hallway.”
Parent Sharon Miller said the way Cary Grove has planned the code red drill is absurd and also thinks it's not necessary to shoot blanks in the hallway.
“If you need to run a drill, you run a drill,” they told WBBM Newsradio's Bernie Tafoya. “They run fire drills all the time, but they don't run up and down the hallway with a flamethrower.”
Parents were also concerned about some students getting too upset during the exercise.
Pinter and Miller both also pointed out that not all guns sound alike, ranging from a light popping sound to a loud bang.
The parents were also concerned about the notification letter from the school. Pinter said they did not receive it in their email. Miller said she's the only one of the parents they know who has received it.
Some in the school community endorse the idea.
Substitute teacher Debbie Gummerson said, “Let's put the kids through some training, and maybe we could save some lives that way, should something ever happen.”
Parent Dina Coutre said, “Nowadays it's better to be safe than sorry.”
School spokesperson Jeff Puma said the small number of parents who have contacted the school are evenly split for and against the drill. They said another notification will be going out today, and teachers will discuss the drill plans with students during classes.
Puma said the school has worked closely with the Cary Police Department on the drill plans.
“It was their recommendation that we do this in order to create the knowledge necessary to keep our students safe in an active crisis situation,” Puma said.
Pinter and Miller also said they don't like the way police recommend students to be “sitting ducks” in their classrooms if there's a shooter in their school.
They said they'd always taught their children to find a way out of the school if they're not near where the shooting is going on–to run out a door or climb out a window.
Puma said, “I don't believe there would be any school that would tell you to do that, and that's coming from police and emergency management officials.”
Last year, Community High School District 155 also used simulated gunshots at another emergency drill at Crystal Lake South High School, but only faculty and staff were present, not students.
The full email:
Dear parents:
At Cary-Grove and across District 155, we make your child's safety our number one priority each day. As a parent, I can assure you that we understand our responsibility to return your child safely at the end of each day. While we take many preventative steps to keep our building secure, we also practice our response should a crisis arise. Some examples include meetings with first responders, a comprehensive crisis response plan, and simulations. We are planning a code red simulation on Wednesday, January 30. We feel it is important to explain the simulation to you in advance so that you and your child might be able to better understand what will take place on Wednesday.
The simulation will take approximately 15-20 minutes, during which time teachers will secure their rooms, draw curtains, and keep their students from traveling throughout the building. Please note that we will be firing blanks in the hallway in an effort to provide our teachers and students some familiarity with the sound of gunfire. Our school resource officer and other members of the Cary Police Department will assist us in sweeping the building to ensure that all students are in a secure location during the drill. At the conclusion of the drill, we will take some time to process what occurred and then we will return to our normal classroom routine.
I encourage you to discuss the drill with your student both before it happens and after. These drills help our students and staff to be prepared should a crisis occur, but it may cause some students to have an emotional reaction. In those cases, your voice may provide reassurances of the drill's importance. Additionally, we have trained social workers on staff who can speak directly with your child should they or they need added support.
Should you have any questions, please contact me or any member of the Cary-Grove's administrative team. Together, we can keep our school a safe place for your child to learn and grow.
Sincerely,
Jay Sargeant

At the end of 2012 I decided to set a goal for 2013 of digging into the 3 tier system and reporting back on what I learned. I came into this endeavor with a set of preconceived notions about the 3 tier system that are drastically different then what I feel now. Throughout the series of posts, I've tried to be as objective as possible and present the views of the people I interviewed. What follows are my thoughts on all those interviews and the 3 tier system as a whole.
When I started this process, I thought the 3 tier system was broken and was a way for the big beer giants to hold down craft beer. I felt like it was a holdover from prohibition aimed solely at trying to stop a resurgence of organized crime related to the production, distribution, and sale of alcohol. All I knew about the 3 tier system at the time was that there were producers, distributors, and retailers all separated from each other and limited in how much of the other levels they could own. All of which is to say I knew very little and had bad preconceived notions.
As soon as I began investigating the Introduction and History I realized the majority of what I knew was wrong. Moving onto the Breweries reinforced some of these new thoughts as well as introduced some new and other doubts about the system. Talking to Distributors shined some light on things and began to change what I thought I knew. Finally, the Retailers gave me a vastly different perspective on what they deal with and how annoying people like me, the rare-addicted-beer-hunter, can be.
After a year of investigation, I now feel that the 3 tier system is not broken. It's not the best it could be, but it is pretty damn good. The biggest problem it has been the variations in states, but I think that's also one of the best things it has going for it. The big beer brands have done a fair dose of damage to the separation of tiers in some states while other states have remained more resilient. I am sure that if this were one national system then it would've most surely been corrupted by the major brands.
I feel that the 3 tier system is one of the bigger consumer and small business protection laws that I'm aware of. Without the separation of manufacturers, producers, and retailers we would have almost no choice and small brewers would either not exist or would not be available outside their own doors. I can say this for sure thanks to the situation in the UK. They did not have anything like the 3 tier system, and the major breweries owned their distribution companies and owned the vast majority of pubs and had exclusivity agreements with stores. This resulted in bars and stores only have beers from 1 brewery and preventing the bar/store from carrying any other breweries products. This is exactly what the 3 tier system prohibits. That set the UK craft beer movement back for many years, and they have only recently begun to catch up with what's happening in America. Though I suspect, some of the situation in the UK could be due to a more traditional mindset (not counting BrewDog).
As I've said I think the system is pretty solid; however, I do feel that there could be some improvements:
Semi-standardization across states – If more states had similar laws, like ABV caps, for example, it'd make it easier for small breweries to know what they were getting into before going into that state.
Reinforced separation of the tiers – This recently came up in Ohio as Budweiser owns a sizable chunk of a distributor up near Canton. There are laws in place to stop them from being too shitty to other breweries but still, I'm not OK with any brewery, be it a billion barrels or one barrel, owning any part of a distributor or store.
Those are relatively small gripes to have in such a massive system. It does work well. There is no doubt in my mind that without the 3 tier system, or with a nationalized 3 tier system or a weaker system, the craft beer movement would not exist. Our beer choices would be limited to the most easily mass-produced and cost-effective beers.
Please share what you've learned from this series of posts and what your thoughts are on the 3 tier system.

Embattled hedge-fund billionaire Steven A. Cohen, whose SAC Capital Advisors is charged with insider trading, paid spiky-haired chef Guy Fieri $100,000 “to be their friend for a day,” a new book reveals.
Cohen paid Fieri to drive around Connecticut with them to reenact a fantasy episode of “Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives,” reveals Allen Salkin in their book, “From Scratch: Inside the Food Network.”
But after “Cohen paid Guy Fieri $100,000 to be their friend for a day,” Salkin writes the odd couple became so close that the chef's top-rated show even featured Cohen's favorite hot-dog spot, the (perhaps appropriately titled) Super Duper Weenie. The popular joint in Fairfield, Conn., offers hot dogs at $3.75 a pop, guaranteed to get any hedge funder through hard times.
Salkin's book also reveals during a trip for a food show in Cleveland, Ohio, in 2004, Rachael Ray and Marc Summers went to a strip club at Mario Batali's urging. “When they arrived . . . it was closing in 15 minutes, Mario ordered 25 shots and sent overlap dances to Marc and Rachael,” who protested “as the strippers sank down onto their laps and began gyrating,” they write. Salkin adds that Ray was so hung-over the following day they “forgot to explain details of their recipes.”
Other dish from the book: Ina Garten shot a pilot for Martha Stewart Living only to have Stewart kill it when they thought the plates were too similar to their own. “I don't want this shown. I want the tapes of this whole series destroyed,” Stewart reportedly screamed.
Salkin tells us they and Food Network execs cooperated on the book “for three years,” but their relationship eventually soured over the direction the tome was taking. A rep for the Food Network declined to comment.
A longtime rep for Cohen — who faces paying a record penalty reportedly exceeding $1 billion to settle the insider-trading case — insisted the story about them “is false,” but admitted Cohen and Fieri do know each other.
India is ranked the eighth most valuable nation brand while the United States retained its top position and China took the second spot in the league of nations according to Brand Finance's Nation Brands 2017.
India went down one spot over the previous year, the report said, because the economy grew at its slowest pace. India switched places with Canada and its brand value dropped by one percentage point while that of Canada's rose 14 per cent. China, the fastest growing nation brand in 2017, saw valuation grow 44 per cent.
The report says that China has gained because “in a virtuous circle, Chinese brands and the transformed image of China as an emerging global power are reinforcing each other.” India, on the other hand, has taken a hit on several fronts. “Reforms must be introduced to maximise job creation, provide fiscal support and to boost economic growth. However, the less than impressive track record of implementing change renders the nation's outlook unstable. This poses a threat to its future nation brand value,” said David Haigh, CEO, Brand Finance.
India improved its brand rating from ‘AA-' to ‘AA' though, but failed to make it into the top ten ‘best performing' or ‘strongest' brands. Brand analysts list democracy, diversity, young population and technological receptivity as the pillars of India's brand value. Brand consultant said that India's strategy for should focus on services and investment.
The report also said that India is seen stronger in attributes related to culture and weaker in attributes related to business. “India needs rapid economic growth, accelerated employment, exponential increase in infrastructure and a do-or-die spirit of enterprise,” says Sandeep Goyal, chairperson, Mogae Media.
According to Haigh, India has surpassed China and the US as the top recipient of greenfield foreign direct investment and the key task is to maintain this position. They also said that the real long-term growth of both the Chinese and the Indian economy has cooled off since last year, but the Chinese economy is still perceived as less risky. Bambawale says that India has to not only match, but exceed China's growth rate consistently for a decade or two, if it wants to climb the Index and reliably hold a higher position.
China is the fastest growing nation brand in absolute terms
US dominance as the most valuable nation brand threatened by Trump's presidency
Asian nation brands boom as the West stagnates
Southern European nations show double-digit growth
Game of Thrones brings record growth to Iceland, brand value up 83% year on year
Singapore defends the strongest nation brand title as it continues to invest in its citizens
Not everyone believes that India needs to pit its brand against China though. N Chandramouli, CEO, TRA, a brand insights agency says, “China has a monolithic government where all decisions are implemented without opposition. India must grow, there is no doubt about it, but our pace must be measured as under a distinct set of conditions.” Brand valuations are not the best indicator of a nation's value or progress they believe.
The report points out that the dynamic between American and Chinese nation brands is mirrored by the broader trends of Western stagnation and Asian advance. Established European nation brands, such as Germany, Netherlands, Belgium, Switzerland, Sweden, Austria, record either a decline or a negligible growth of value. At the same time, Asian nation brands grew at breakneck speed.
One of the most interesting stories among nation brands in 2017 is that of Iceland. Its tourism industry is booming, post the success of Game of Thrones that was shot in the country, helping it become the fastest growing nation brand of 2017, up 83 per cent from last year.
India, on the other hand, saw a two per cent drop in tourism over the past year. Bambawale says, “The gap between advertising and on-ground experience is huge. High-ticket tourists pay prices equal to anywhere in the world, so why come here when they can do better elsewhere? Backpackers add little to revenue.”
But time and again, Obama has refused the offer. During the 2008 campaign, they called themselves the "anti-doctrinaire" candidate -- and they have stuck to that line. The president has been attacked from the right for lacking decisiveness and vision. But if the whole idea of presidential doctrines were relegated to the history books, it would be a fine day for the Republic.
Presidential doctrines are too, well, doctrinal. These proclamations can become a straightjacket that constrains a president's options. Simplistic pronouncements are especially dangerous when we live in a complex world with diffuse threats, as we do today. The Arab Spring, for example, with its distinct local dynamics, requires flexibility -- and even inconsistency. Intervention in Libya does not also mean intervention in Syria.
And there's something very odd about each president getting one and only one doctrine. The Truman Doctrine, after all, came in 1947, just two years into Truman's administration. What if they later had a eureka moment and came up with a second doctrine? Could they scrub out the first, and etch in a replacement?
More importantly, presidential doctrines have a poor record. The Truman Doctrine encouraged a universal definition of U.S. national interests during the Cold War that helped draw the United States into Vietnam. Meanwhile, the Bush Doctrine linked diverse local struggles in an overarching war on terror, lumped Iran and North Korea together in an unlikely "Axis of Evil," and produced a failed policy in Iraq.
This record may explain why other nations haven't copied the idea. Bismarck didn't have a doctrine. Neither did Churchill. These statesmen wanted flexibility in their foreign policy. Churchill once told the British Parliament: "If Hitler invaded hell I would make at least a favorable reference to the devil in the House of Commons."
Is the answer to lurch to the other extreme, and embrace a foreign policy of pragmatism? With new crises keeping the phones ringing at the White House, it's tempting to abandon systematic thinking and focus on the day-to-day. The great theorist Marx once said -- and here, of course, I'm talking about Groucho Marx: "These are my principles and if you don't like them ... I have others."
But the United States cannot simply be reactive or ad hoc in its foreign policy. It must pursue coherent goals. And presidents need to recognize that foreign policy issues are connected, with actions in, say, Afghanistan rippling out and affecting other areas of the world, like a stone thrown in a pool.
We don't need a doctrine, or pure pragmatism. What we require is a middle path: a strategy.
A strategy identifies our core interests and the major threats, and guides presidents in safeguarding those interests. But it avoids cookie-cutter rules, and understands local variation.
Double MotoGP champion Marc Marquez's ability to throw their Repsol Honda around like a dirt bike amazes former 500cc star Daryl Beattie.
Beattie, runner-up to Mick Doohan in the 1995 World Championship, told Crash.net: "You can see Marquez's ability on dirt track especially. The amazing thing for me is that they ride their MotoGP bike like they ride the dirt bike. They get the thing in weird angles, it's tucking and turning... Their feel and ability to do that is unbelievable.
"So much has changed since the days of Barry Sheene, in terms of the tyres and electronics, but the guys now are certainly tucking and sliding a lot. Dirt track does an enormous amount for that."
The Australian added: "Marquez is frighteningly naturally talented and he's got a head on their shoulders Somebody like Anthony Gobert was probably just as talented as Marquez, if you talk about raw ability on a dirt bike or road bike. But from the shoulders up it was missing.
"During my time the standout rider was Mick [Doohan], but Mick is very different to Marquez. Mick worked hard to get where they were - as everyone does - but I think there is more natural ability with Marquez.
"After Mick there was Rossi, then I would say Casey [Stoner]. Casey wasn't there long enough to dominate for a long period, but certainly their ability was unbelievable. And now there is Marquez.
"So from my time onwards there have only been four of those really brilliant guys - and that's not taking anything away from the others. They are all unbelievable riders to make it at that level.
"But I think in any game you only see that odd one come through maybe once a decade and Marquez is the man of the moment."
With Marquez replacing the retiring Stoner at the Repsol Honda team, MotoGP narrowly missed out on seeing the pair go head-to-head.
"It would have been a great clash," Beattie agreed. "You can see the rapport that Marquez has with Valentino. All the top guys seem to get along pretty good at the moment. But I think if Casey had been there with Marquez, two young guys at the top of their game, we would have seen some sparks."
Australia's first Honda MotoGP since Stoner will be Jack Miller, who is moving directly to the premier-class after finishing runner-up in Moto3 last season.
"I certainly think Jack's got the ability to do it for Australia," Beattie said. "I think he's matured massively in the last couple of years, especially their KTM season. I think Aki Ajo was a great leader for them and taught them a lot.
"At first I was a bit sceptical [about moving straight to MotoGP], but from what I've seen so far I think he's done a great job and is ready to make the jump."

13 Reasons Why manipulates a thought we've all had at one point or another, the power of getting the final word. It's suicide as a revenge fantasy, a way to make someone stop and consider the ways they have hurt you and maybe feel the depths of the ways they have been wrong. When you feel powerless, the fantasy feels like the only way you can speak loud enough that people will listen. But it's a fantasy for a reason, real life doesn't work this way. Depression doesn't work this way.
If you haven't seen the miniseries streaming now on Netflix, the plot follows a group of high school students who knew Hannah Baker, a fellow student who recently killed herself. Before they died, Hannah left a series of tapes detailing people in their life and how their actions toward them caused them to become suicidal and take their own life. They task the tapes' subjects to listen to them in order to fully understand the gravity of their actions. Spoiler alert: the movie ends with one of the students, Clay Jensen, realizing that they should have reached out more to Hannah, that perhaps their love could have saved them They then reaches out to another student they now notices has been struggling.
I'm sorry but this is total BS.
This is a violent stripping of Hannah's agency to make their own decisions.  They are not floating around on a whim waiting to see if Clay is going to make their life worth living. When Hannah's mental pain became unbearable, it was due to them surviving a series of traumatic emotional events, yes, but more importantly it was due to their mental health — a battle that inappropriately takes place mostly off-screen. The answer to mental pain isn't for some guy to love you and show you that you are worthy. The answer is to figure out how to survive these events and hold onto your worth as you do this. Other people can't save you, and you shouldn't want them to.
We know Hannah's bigger battle was mental illness because we understand the magnitude and finality of taking your own life. We get to know Hannah in the series and we know they aren't so hot-tempered as to make a drastic, permanent decision in order to manipulate guilt out of people. She's presented as more thoughtful and multi-dimensional than that. If anything, the traumatic events they endured were the tip of the iceberg, but we are never shown what's down below.
And that's where the story falls apart. The kind of serious, severe depression that leads to suicide is not caused by someone's actions. No one else creates this internal mental state for you, even if their brutal actions make depression increasingly hard to fight against it. You still have agency. You are still in charge.
If Netflix wanted to make a show about suicide, they should have worked with the book's author Jay Asher as well as people who work in mental health. It's common to have technical advisors involved in the writing process when you don't know what you're talking about (like a writer with no medical experience describing complex surgeries in scenes for Grey's Anatomy) and that element is sorely missing here. It would save from the experience of watching the show as a person who has experienced depression and having the overwhelming feeling of “these people don't know what the fuck they're talking about.”

MADISON – A study released Monday estimates 16,800 or more people in Dane and Milwaukee counties were deterred from casting ballots in November because of Wisconsin's voter ID law.
The study by University of Wisconsin-Madison political scientist Ken Mayer concluded 16,800 to 23,250 voters in the two counties — the Democratic strongholds of Wisconsin — did not vote because of the voter ID law. The $55,000 survey was paid for with property tax money by Dane County Clerk Scott McDonell, a Democratic opponent of the law.
Key portions of those surveyed said they did not vote because they did not have ID that would allow them to or did not believe the IDs they had could be used under the voting law. The study found the ID law disproportionately affected African-Americans and low-income people.
"As the clerk who serves the largest population of African-Americans in the state, I was shocked by the numbers and am furious to see that Jim Crow laws are alive and well," Milwaukee County Clerk George Christenson said in a news release.
Tom Evenson, a spokesperson for GOP Gov. Scott Walker, said Wisconsin's voter ID law "protects the integrity of our voting process." After the election in November, Walker didn't hold back in rejecting the idea that the ID law had depressed turnout.
“It's just a load of crap. I can't say it more clearly,” Walker told conservative radio host Charlie Sykes at the time. “People didn't turn out in Milwaukee because Hillary Clinton was not an aspirational candidate for them. It's that simple.”
Wisconsin's voter ID law was approved in 2011, but blocked for years by litigation. Last year's presidential election was the highest-turnout election since it went into effect.
Mayer served as an expert witness for opponents of the voter ID law in some of that litigation.
The UW-Madison study sought to determine what would have happened if the election had been run in a different way than it actually was — never an easy proposition for academics or anyone else.

Mayer sent surveys to 2,400 people who were registered to vote but did not vote. Of those, 293 were returned.
Many of those who did not vote said they did so for reasons that didn't have to do with the voter ID law — such as because they didn't like any of the candidates on the ballot, were ill, didn't have time or didn't think their vote would matter. But 7% or more said they did not vote because of the ID law.
Mayer used that data to estimate the number of voters in the two counties who did not vote in November because of the ID law. The response rate was sufficient to extrapolate statistically sound estimates, they said.

In December of last year, then-president-elect Donald Trump tweeted that the projected cost of two new Air Force One aircraft was too high, and they threatened to "cancel" the order. The Defense Department then began a study to find ways to lower the cost of new presidential transport planes. After some searching, it sounds like the Air Force has found a solution in the form of two 747-8Is that were abandoned by a defunct Russian airline.
A new report fromDefense One indicates that the U.S. Air Force is finalizing a contract with Boeing to purchase two passenger 747-8s that were previously owned by Russian airline Transaero, but never delivered to Russia. The aviation company was the second-largest airline in Russia for a time, but it went bankrupt in 2015. Two years earlier, Transaero ordered the 747s, but the struggling airline defaulted on payments to Boeing for the planes.
While Russia's largest airline, Aeroflot, absorbed most of the Transaero fleet, it did not opt to take the 747-8 orders. So Boeing flew the two planes, which were built but never delivered to Transaero, to a storage facility at the Southern California Logistics Airport in Victorville, in the middle of the Mojave Desert. The facility is used as an aircraft boneyard where the arid climate helps prevent aircraft corrosion.
Now the Air Force is planning to buy Transaero's old 747-8s for "a good deal," according to Defense One. The official purchase could be announced by the Pentagon as soon as this week. The final price for the aircraft will not be released, but the average price for a 747-8 is just shy of $387 million. The Air Force could pick up the two Transaero 747-8s for a good bit cheaper, however, considering they were previously purchased and currently reside in the boneyard where Boeing is paying to store them.
"We're working through the final stages of coordination to purchase two commercial 747-8 aircraft and expect to award a contract soon," Air Force spokesperson Ann Stefanek said in a statement emailed to Defense One and Bloomberg.
The two likely-future-presidential-transport-aircraft are numbered N894BA and N895BA. FlightAware route data shows the two 747s were last flown in February, when they traveled from Paine Field in Snohomish County, Washington, to their current storage facility in Mojave.
After the Air Force purchases the aircraft, it will still be a number of years before the two planes are ready to serve as Air Force One. Work to outfit the 747s with secure communications, defensive capabilities, and reinforced electronics to resist an electromagnetic pulse will follow as the Air Force takes bids from contractors to complete the modifications. The structure of the aircraft will also need to undergo significant modification as the standard fuselage interior needs to be ripped out and replaced with offices, conference rooms, and living quarters for the President and the First Family, as well as staffers, press and guests.
The two aircraft that currently serve as the primary presidential transports are highly modified 747-200Bs that have been in service since 1990. The Air Force needs to replace these planes with more modern technology and more efficient aircraft. The new Air Force One jumbo jets will certainly not be completed during President Trump's first term, though they might get a chance to fly on the blue-and-white 787-8s if they are elected to a second term.
Given the current requirements for Air Force One, including four engines and room for at least 70 passengers, the 747 is the only currently manufactured American-built option. However, 747 sales have been dropping, and Boeing doesn't expect to continue manufacturing the passenger version of the plane. Twin-engine aircraft, such as the 777 and 787, are more efficient and cost-effective for international airlines.
So it may be that the Air Force has found its last 747s to serve as Air Force One, just waiting for them in the Mojave Desert.

Global Reflections
1-Numerous experiences, feats and achievements against sanctions
The Islamic Republic has moved forward. Today, the Islamic Republic is not like it was 35 years ago. Are our numerous experiences, feats and achievements, our great regional influence and the deep belief of the youth of this country in the Revolution's principles minor achievements? These events are all facts.
They are miscalculating on different levels. By Allah's favor and with the determination of the people and you youth, the same things that the honorable commander in this meeting referred to about the activities of the Air Force are being pursued in different sectors and in all the of the country's organizations. Moreover, such things are accomplished while we are under sanctions. They are accomplished while enemies are imposing sanctions on us. We have made progress in different sciences and technologies. We have made progress in different social matters. We have made progress in different international matters. Different experiences will constantly provide an invaluable provision for the Islamic Republic. We are moving forward and making progress despite the enemy.[1]
2-Thirty years of enmity with no result
For more than thirty years, the enemies of the Iranian nation have done everything in their power to harm the Iranian nation. There is not a thing which they have not used against the Iranian nation. They provoked conflicts, waged wars, supported the enemy of the Islamic Republic with all their power and they waged hard and soft wars. They fought the people of Iran as hard as they could, but our people stood up against them and they resisted. Not only could they not bring our people to their knees and destroy them, but they also failed to prevent them from making progress. Our nation has made progress. They made use of everything they could. They hatched plots, launched coup d'états, provoked military conflicts, shot down passenger airliners, imposed heavy sanctions and increased them on a daily basis. They did these things in the hope that our people would lose their hope, disappear from the scene and lose their trust in Islam and the Islamic Republic. But they failed. This is the record of the Islamic Republic.[2]
3-Iran's people did not surrender even when they were in more difficult conditions
Today, you see that the enemies of Iran do not know our people and our country. Of course, they have always failed to know the people of Iran or they have always failed to know them in the proper way. They have always made this mistake and today, they are making the same mistake. They think that our people have held their hands up to surrender under pressure from their sanctions and economic siege. But this is not the case. You enemies are making a mistake. The people of Iran are not a people who hold their hands up as a sign of surrender. Our people did not surrender even when they were in more difficult conditions.
One clear, definite and undeniable example of this is the eight-year imposed war. Is eight years of resistance a minor achievement? Is it a minor achievement to defeat all the global powers that helped a criminal to work against our country and our people? Is this a minor feat? In this case too, there was “…and helping the believers is ever incumbent on Us”. In this case too, showing firm determination and willpower and bringing God-given capabilities to the arena of action solved the problems one by one.[3]
4-Youth found their opportunity to reveal their talents due to sanctions
If it had not been for the economic and scientific sanctions, our youth would not have found the opportunity to reveal their talents. That is to say, everything was in place, but they would not have taken action and achieved anything [if it had not been for the sanctions]. After they imposed sanctions, talents were utilized, the nation started to grow and this flag was raised higher. “They desire to put out the light of Allah with their mouths but Allah will perfect Their light though the unbelievers may be averse.” [The Holy Quran, 61: 8] They want to put out the light, but God has pre-ordained that this light should become perfect, and it will become perfect.[4]
5-The possibility to distance Iran's economy from oil and disabling sanctions
The Americans expressed joy and said that I have confessed to the effect of the sanctions. Yes, the sanctions have not been inconsequential. If they are happy about this, let them be happy. After all, the sanctions have had an effect, which is because of an essential flaw that we are suffering from. The flaw that our economy is suffering from is that it is dependent on oil. We need to distance our economy from oil. Our governments should include this among their basic plans. Seventeen, eighteen years ago, I told the government of that time and its officials that they should act in a way that we could shut down our oil wells whenever we wanted to. The so-called “technocrats” smiled in disbelief, as if to say, “Is that even possible?” Yes, it is possible. It is necessary to follow up the issue, take action and make plans. When economic plans of a country are built on a particular base, the enemies of that country will target that base. Yes, the sanctions have had an effect, but not the effect that the enemies wanted.[5]
6-Iran's problems are smaller than its goals and values
We are faced with political pressures, sanctions, negative propaganda and other kinds of pressures, but in spite of these problems, there is firm determination to eliminate these problems and reach the point that we are supposed to reach. These are the conditions of the country.
We have not at all reached a dead end. We are not at all faced with problems which can break our resolve to continue our path. Such problems do not exist. Yes, there are problems, but these problems are not big enough to break our resolve. They are smaller than the goals and values of our nation and our country. Yet we do not want to take a break and rest. We are in the middle of the arena, which is challenging and motivating at the same time, just like competing in sports events. Taking part in sports events involves exertion and anxiety, but there is also enthusiasm. No competitor refuses to participate in sports events because of exertion and anxiety. On the contrary, they are filled with enthusiasm. There is mental and physical exertion involved, but this does not stop competitors from taking part in sports events. Our conditions are like this.[6]
7-If sanctions can serve the purpose, then why do they issue military threats?
The Americans should know and I think they know that sanctions do not work. The reason why we say they themselves know that sanctions do not work is the military threats they issue. Well, if sanctions can serve the purpose, then why do they issue military threats? This shows that sanctions have not served the purpose and that they do not work.[7]
8-Sanctions and pressures cannot continue
Another reality is that if the country judiciously resists these pressures by the enemy – particularly, the sanctions and other such things – not only will their technique prove ineffective, but also it will be impossible for them to repeat such things in the future. This is because we are going through a phase, a stage. The country will go through this stage. The threats they make and the sanctions they impose will benefit nobody other than America and the Zionist regime. The others stepped into the arena because of their coercion, pressure and other such things, or they did so as a ceremonial gesture. It is obvious that such things as coercion and pressure cannot continue. These things will only continue for a while. [8]

A unique archaeological find uncovered near the site of a Roman villa in Dorset could help to shed light on the rural elite of late-Roman Britain.
The skeletal remains are thought to be unique as they are buried near the site of a Roman villa, making it likely that the five skeletons belonged to the owners and occupants of the villa -- the first time in Britain that the graves of villa owners have been found in such close proximity to the villa itself.
Five skeletons were found; two adult males, two adult females and an elderly female -- with researchers postulating that they could be the remains of three generations of the same family, who all owned the villa. The bones are thought to date from the mid-4th Century (around 350 AD).
Miles Russell, a Senior Lecturer in Archaeology at Bournemouth University and one of the archaeologists leading the dig, said, "The discovery is of great significance as it is the only time where evidence of a villa and the villa's occupants have been found in the same location in Britain. This could provide us with significant information, never retrieved before, about the state of health of the villa owners, their ancestry and where they came from."
Miles continued, "One of the big questions in South West is whether the villas in the South West were owned by Britons who have become Roman or owned by people from another part of the Empire who have come to exploit an under-developed rural area. All villas in this region in the South West are late-Roman -- and our findings should tell us more about what life was like in this period of history. This is what what can be assessed when the bones are analysed."
The discovery was made by staff and students from Bournemouth University, who are working on the Durotriges Big Dig project in North Dorset.
The villa itself was excavated last year by students working on the project, and the latest find is the final step in excavating this particular area of rich archaeological significance.
Paul Cheetham, Senior Lecturer in Archaeological Sciences and co-director of the project, added, "We are looking at the rural elite of late-Roman Britain, living through the economic collapse that took place during this period. These remains will shed light on the final stages of the golden age of Roman Britain."
Students in Munich have crunched data on every Game of Thrones character to predict their likelihood of death – turns out Jon Snow's was a statistical shocker
Spoiler alert! This story is about people being killed off in Game of Thrones
It is 2016, and nothing can escape data analysis. Not even Game of Thrones.
Students at the Technical University of Munich have applied their skills to helping us understand the likelihood of a character's death over the course of Game of Thrones, the sixth series of which begins on 24 April.
Their project A Song of Ice and Data analyses as much online data as it can find about both the book and the TV series, regularly scraping and updating information from the vast, fan-based Wiki of Ice and Fire, the Game of Thrones wiki, Wikipedia and Twitter. The algorithm categorized each character by more than 20 features including age, title, gender, number of dead relations and their popularity, based on incoming and outgoing links on the Wiki of Ice and Fire.
There are 2,028 characters in the full Game of Thrones world, typically with more than 30 characters in each episode of the TV show and more than twice the number of male characters than female.
Men are more likely to play noble characters, whereas women are more likely to play peasants – but are are also less likely to be killed off. The Munich team said they had developed a machine-learning algorithm to predict the likelihood of death for characters, and found it is 33% for men and 23% for women.
Encyclopaedia Westerosa: the biggest Game of Thrones mysteries, solved Read more
They extended the analysis to the age of characters killed, which only really tails off at the age of 70 and is most likely between 31 and 40. Identifying various other predictors of risks, the tool could then predict which characters were most likely to be, perhaps quite literally, axed. And some have already been axed, not least the beautiful Jon Snow who – and maybe we didn't need data to tell us this – suffered an unexpected death. They didn't deserve to die!
Among the findings, ordered by likelihood of death:
Tommen Baratheon - 97%
The boy king currently sitting on the Iron Throne looking slightly vulnerable and very easy to kill.
Stannis Baratheon - 96%
The wannabe king who murdered their own daughter in their desperation to make it to the throne. Not a very nice man, and actually already dead. And deservedly so.
Daenerys Targaryen - 95%
Queen of the Andals and the Rhoynar and the First Men, Khaleesi of the Great Grass Sea, Breaker of Shackles/Chains, Queen of Meereen, Lady Regnant of the Seven Kingdoms, Mother of Dragons. (Friends call them Dany.)
Davos Seaworth - 91%
Former smuggler and Stannis's right hand man. It might be a shame to kill off Davos, as he's been doing so well with their reading homework.
Petyr Baelish - 91%
Snakey Petyr Bealish is a master spy whose ruthless ambition has earned them many enemies. Also their accent has changed quite a lot, so maybe kill them off for that?
And as for Jon Snow?
Please oh please Lord of Light – could Jon Snow be, like, not dead? Let's cling to the hope that producers may have acknowledged their popularity on Twitter, which showed a huge spike of outrage on the night their death was broadcast.
And there is computer-determined reason why, it says here, because their system has determined they only had an 11% likelihood of death. What were they thinking?!
Citing the development of “a Wild West campaign spending world,” Common Cause and more than 50 other organizations joined today in calling on President Obama to issue an executive order requiring government contractors to disclose their political spending.
In a letter to the President, the groups said a strong disclosure requirement “is imperative” and would be an effective weapon against corruption in government contracting.
“President Obama said in their State of the Union that a better politics means spending ‘less time drowning in dark money … that pull[s] us into the gutter,'” said Common Cause President Miles Rapoport. “The President has an opportunity to shine a light on the millions of secret dollars influencing our elections and require government contractors to disclose their political spending.
“Issuing this executive order is squarely within their authority as chief executive. The public interest demands we curb the culture of pay-to-play that infects Washington – but first we have to know who is beholden to whom. That's why it's important that the President use their authority to help build a ‘better politics' and sign this executive order,” Rapoport added.
State and federal laws generally bar action to reward or penalize government contractors based on their political expenditures. But the groups argued that repeated scandals have reinforced the public's sense that companies and executives get special treatment in return for their political spending.
The groups said Obama should order that federal contractors disclose any political expenditures from their corporate treasuries as well as contributions by senior managers and affiliated political action committees after contracts have been awarded. The order also should require federal contractors to affirmatively certify that they are in compliance with the federal ban on direct or indirect political contributions, they asserted.
More than a dozen states have imposed similar campaign finance disclosure requirements on government contractors.
The groups' plea to Obama comes five years after the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission that corporations, unions and associations have a constitutional right to spend unlimited sums to influence elections. The decision has triggered an explosion of new campaign spending, with much of the money provided by anonymous donors operating through tax-exempt “social welfare” organizations.

Martin Pelikan writes in with this report from g2k14:
My initial plan was to bring our base to a state where LLVM's libcpp could be compiled, giving us C++11 support. After I read up on the latest POSIX locale additions, other developers made it clear that more library version cranks will be necessary in order not to break ports. After the first diff was ready, I set up a base system build to check if it breaks. And then my life has changed...
Few days before the hackathon I decided to reinstall my laptop and put Linux, Windows and OpenBSD next to each other. One of the locale-related articles was left on the Linux partition and I wanted to open it in Austria, which is just full of tunnels without the internet. Our kernel didn't like the ext4; being too lazy to reboot, I decided to take a look at it "if I have a spare moment", which base builds certainly are.
No wonder -- ext4 uses extents, which weren't supported at that time. Quick look at FreeBSD showed they already have read-only support which became more or less functional on my OpenBSD kernel on Wednesday evening. No HTree directory indexes, no 64-bit block numbers, no journal or snapshots or multi-mount protection. But I could finally read the PDF without rebooting, and then also copy a file bigger than 4 GB or open a directory with 50,000 subdirectories in it. Never even looked at filesystem code before, and now a working port in a few hours? Life was great!
The question now was how to integrate it. OpenBSD developers don't like huge diffs for a very good reason. After fixing the inode format and adding new flags, Ted pointed out the ancient rule "whoever touched it last now becomes the maintainer" was valid even here. It was obvious I had to gain more knowledge by reading design papers and other systems' code before I can do valuable and correct commits. Legacy remnants like hard-coded (and wrong) limit on file sizes went first. Parts of the code were pretty badly comprehensible but FreeBSD has managed to split them up somehow. After our code paths looked similar enough, the ext4 extent support hit the tree.
Despite the fact that hackathons' purpose should be to write code, I had to literally learn to work with a subsystem I've only seen very vaguely once before (with FUSE). Because FreeBSD has already had these bits and getting them to work was so easy, this was a very good place to learn how to write filesystem code myself. During the next days I wrote code parsing and following the journal and ended up deliberately breaking my filesystem to observe what should we do about recovering it in seconds and how to order writes to support them in the future. Let's try to continue going down this road.
All this wouldn't have been possible without Phillip Guenther who reviewed my diffs after I kept distracting them from way more important things to do. Ted, Theo, Ken and Bob gave me lots of valuable input and explained how are things supposed to really work. Stephan Sperling gave me access to one of their sparc64 machines and gladly kept the tree up-to-date, so my breakages were relatively few and minor. Discussions about the network stack helped to narrow our focus to a direction and explaining our concerns about other solutions. Mitja must have been very busy with organizing the event so that things would go as well as they did. Well done everyone, thanks!
Now let's hope this filesystem enthusiasm will last longer, because now I need to switch back to GSoC in an area I'm already familiar with. Breaking my filesystem now will hopefully help to repair yours one day...

With the average cinema ticket in the U.K. costing over $9.60, film distributors have to work pretty hard to get cinema-goers to hand over their cash – even more so when a 3-D or Imax release can cost as much as a DVD. Getting film lovers to see your release a second time is thus even harder.
[partner id="wireduk"]
However, writer and director Rian Johnson has come up with a novel way of getting fans of their time travel/science fiction thriller Looper to return to the silver screen – or loop their experience, if you will. The U.S. director has released a downloadable audio commentary for audience members to listen to while watching Looper for a second time, offering insights into the filming-decision, writing and creative processes.
"I recorded a commentary track to be downloaded, put on an iPod and listened to in the theater as you're watching Looper," Johnson explains on *Looper'*s Tumblr account. "It is totally different from the commentary track that will be on the Blu-ray/DVD, a bit more technical and detailed."
Johnson has tried the idea out before, releasing a commentary for their 2008 film The Brothers Bloom. Having received requests from fans on Twitter to release a similar commentary, Johnson decided to give the scheme a second outing – but implores viewers not to use the commentary on their first viewing.
The introduction of the MP3 track contains instructions as to how viewers can sync the commentary to the film – as well as Johnson's own pleas that users wear suitable headphones and don't use devices with bright screens, so as to avoid distracting other cinemagoers.
Looper, staring Bruce Willis and Joseph Gordon-Levitt, is set between the years 2044 and 2074 – a future in which criminal gangs are able to dispose of people by sending them back in time to be dealt with by hired guns known as loopers. Joe (Gordan-Levitt) is one such looper, whose world falls apart when their own old self (Willis) is sent back to be killed. Gordon-Levitt would spend three hours in makeup before every filming session, adding a false nose, lower and upper lip sections and having hair added to their eyebrows in order to appear more like Willis.
You can download the commentary here. Does Johnson's scheme tempt you to go back to the cinema a second time? Are there any other films you would like to see in the cinema with a director's commentary? Let us know with a comment below.
Justin Trudeau: Just Another Soros Puppet
George Soros and legalised murder in Canada
JMJ
Nov.04, 2016
George Soros is the reason Canada has legalised murder. Who is George Soros? That is becoming less and less of a secret.  They are an 85-year-old multi billionaire who among other things is an atheist, but they [really] thinks he's god. They spend their money creating political and social unrest to create a One World Order run by unelected zombies who do as they're told by people like Soros.
Soros buys politicians, and Junior Trudeau was one of their better and easier items. Trudeau Senior (Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau) was a One Worlder who called themselves a “Citizen of the World”. In World War II Pierre , rather than fighting for God and Country in the muddy trenches of Europe, was riding about Quebec City on a motorcycle wearing a Nazi war helmet. Pierre was a member of the elite Club of Rome, which is committed to globalism.
Communist Lester B. Pearson who got elected not by the Communist banner, but by the Liberal Banner, chose Pierre as their Minister of Justice although they did not have a seat in Parliament. Trudeau quickly shredded incriminating evidence against themselves and went on to be the Prime Minister who brought in as No.1 an Omnibus Bill that legalised abortion, homosexuality, contraception….
When the Soros elite wanted someone to bring in euthanasia and assisted suicide they could find no better minion than son of Trudeau. Not only that, Junior was and is a pot head. George Soros funds anything and anyone who advocates the legalisation of marijuana.
Our present Prime Minister is not answerable to the people of Canada but rather to the person or persons who paid for him. Soros wants legalisation of murder. After a few hours of debate, bullying and physical abuse, Trudeau gives their owners Canada as a country that has the worst anti-life law in the world.
George Soros is a Hungarian Jew who hates Jews. They spent WWII delivering deportation orders to send Jews to the concentration camps. Soros funds any group who will attack Israel. Trudeau does not want to fight ISIS because ISIS is against Israel and; well you know how their political masters feel about that.
George Soros is against borders, countries, patriotism, democracy, elections; unless they can rig them. Trudeau has shown us their contempt for their country and for democracy in the Legalised Murder Non-Debate.
We pray Soros will be defeated along with the female Clinton they own next Monday. It will be that much easier to clean out the globalists and anti-lifers in Ottawa, as well as in our hospitals. Gay

The end of April saw the fewer workers getting unemployment benefits than anytime in the last 28 years, the Department of Labor reported Thursday in a sign of the labor market's increasing health.
Just 1.9 million people received unemployment insurance benefits at the end of the month, the fewest since 1988. Benefits are available for up to 26 weeks in most states.
Even more engouraging: Averaging over the past four weeks, total unemployment benefit claims are running at the lowest rate since 1974, despite the workforce being 75 percent bigger.
Thursday's report also showed new jobless claims dropping to 236,000 in the first week of May, an extremely low level.
Forecasters had expected 244,000 new jobless claims, which are adjusted for seasonal variations.
Low jobless claims are a good sign. If fewer workers are going to state unemployment agencies to collect benefits, that indicates that layoffs are scarce. Because the claims numbers are released weekly, to provide a near-real-time gauge of the health of the jobs market for investors and government officials.
Thursday's report suggests that more robust jobs reports may be in store.
Economists calculate that jobless claims below the 300,000 mark go along with stable or falling unemployment. At 4.4 percent in April, the unemployment rate is already below where Federal Reserve officials thought it would go if the economy were fully healthy, hinting that there is still scope for improvement for U.S. workers.
An interesting interview with George Romero over their film career making “zombie movies” and their latest film “Survival of the Dead.”
(Sigh) George Romero's line, “I almost don't think of them as Zombie films.”
See, I agree. I almost don't think of Your new films as zombie films either…. That's not a good thing, George!!!
Why does that annoy me so much. Maybe because it's the man who basically created the genre I love so much not taking the very subject matter seriously. If you want to make social and political statements, like Michael Moore, fine go do it. Make a documentary.
But if you want to make a good zombie movie, try harder to not make them suck.
I'm sure plenty of you out there disagree with me, but I am simply more underwhelmed with each new movie Romero makes…. And it annoys the crap out of me. They SHOULD be getting more awesome. But they're not.
Arsene Wenger has confirmed that a deal for Mohamed Elneny is close to completion having taken a little longer than expected.
Negotiations with the Egyptian's club, FC Basle, have been successful with the hold up down to work permit complications. There's no suggestion the move could collapse with Wenger happy to speak openly about the midfielder in their pre-Sunderland press conference.
“The deal is complicated a little bit,” said Wenger. “We work hard on it, we hope in the next two to three days we get to the end of it.
They added: “The only [signing]? I don't rule out anybody else. They [Elneny] will at least be one of the signings and comes into an area where we are short at the moment.”
The boss also tackled a series of questions on other transfer business, admitting Mathieu Debuchy could still leave the club this month.
“He has an opportunity to go, yes, but we've not been in touch with any club,” noted Wenger.
Spurious rumours linking Watford's Troy Deeney with a move to the Emirates and a Chelsea approach for Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain were dismissed as rubbish by a chuckling Wenger.
Share. A Ninja/sushi chef, and a Robin Hood lookalike. Sly's got one hell of a family tree. A Ninja/sushi chef, and a Robin Hood lookalike. Sly's got one hell of a family tree.
Everybody has a family, unless you're like, an orphan, or they all died in a freak Playstation Move accident. We here at IGN are sorry for your loss. But maybe this preview for Sly Cooper: Thieves in Time will cheer you up. They have a big family, and they're all super cool.
Sony already showed off two of Sly's ancestor inspired costumes – the Arabian thief getup and samurai armor – at E3, but this time developer Sanzaru introduced two of Sly's famous relatives. The first, Rioichi Cooper, a deadly ninja warrior who also invented sushi. And yes, a ninja raccoon is just as cool looking as it sounds. Check them out:
Sly fans will remember Rioichi as the ancestor who taught Sly the spire jumping technique, one of the first moves they ever learns. But the ninja has more tricks up their sleeve. As you play them (yeah you get to play as Sly's family this time), you'll learn new moves like a long jump that allows you to leap between spires and cover normally impassable distances.
While Rioichi sneaks through their restaurant to retrieve their sushi knives, Sly is busy trying to save their other famous relative, Sir Galleth Cooper. The famed medieval thief has been captured, and forced into a life of daredevil acrobatics. Galleth has also been forced into a humiliating getup, making them decidedly less badass than their ninja relative.
Yikes.
Sly uses Galleth's sweet bow and arrow to create ropelines across the deadly fire-filled circus. Whether or not the bow can be used to attack bad guys remains to be seen (please be yes!). Aside from the new bow mechanic, much of the circus level plays like a very traditional Sly Cooper platforming level, though the verticality of the circus adds more scale than last generation's offerings.
Every time Sanzaru shows off Sly Cooper: Thieves in Time the game looks completely different. The variety of gameplay and the unique feel fit with the Sly series' history of switching up the gameplay for each new iteration, which still keeping that core Sly Cooper experience. Thieves in Time doesn't come out until fall, but feel free to start getting psyched for it, because it's fun.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - A divided appeals court in Manhattan on Thursday rejected New York City's plan to give small homeowners a $183 credit on their water and sewer bills, a defeat for Mayor Bill de Blasio.

The Appellate Division, First Department of the State Supreme Court ruled 3-1 that the city's water board lacked a rational basis to award the credit to owners of one- to three-family homes, while leaving other property owners ineligible.
De Blasio had last April promoted the one-time credit, to be funded with a water board surplus, to cut annual water and sewer bills by 17 percent to 40 percent for about 664,000 homeowners.
Their proposal also included a 2.1 percent rate increase, and was to take effect last July 1.
But real estate companies and the Rent Stabilization Association trade group objected. They called it unfair to subject larger landlords, and in turn their tenants, to the rate hike, while denying them the credit.
The appeals court said the credit “cannot be reconciled” with the city's budgetary needs, and the water board had no basis to conclude that small homeowners were “more needy” than other property owners or paid too much relative to them.
De Blasio said in a statement they remained “confident” that homeowners will eventually receive the credit.
“Wealthy landlords and high-priced lobbyists have spared nothing to line their own pockets at the expense of hardworking New Yorkers,” they said. “Today's court ruling keeps $183 of water rate relief out of the hands of everyday homeowners - for now.”
Michael Berengarten, a partner at Herrick Feinstein representing the objecting landlords, welcomed the decision.
“This was a flat giveaway to a broad class of property owners, regardless of need, without any legitimate water-related purpose,” they said in a phone interview.
“Board members are appointed by the mayor, and abdicated their responsibilities to achieve the mayor's political goals,” they added.
De Blasio is widely expected to seek re-election this year.
Thursday's unsigned decision upheld a June 2016 ruling by State Supreme Court Justice Carol Edmead in Manhattan.
Justice Marcy Kahn dissented, saying the water board had authority to help “overburdened” lower and middle-class homeowners, including the elderly, facing rising water rates.
The case is Prometheus Realty Corp et al v New York City Water Board et al, New York State Supreme Court, Appellate Division, First Department, No. 653003/2016.
"In Some Ways, I Feel Like a Queen," Says Krysta Rodriguez on Kicking Cancer — In Style
"Smash" star and Broadway actor Krysta Rodriguez announced yesterday that they were diagnosed with breast cancer two months after their 30th birthday. They open up exclusively to Playbill.com about fighting back and feeling fabulous.
*
"They brought me into the really nice room with the couches, and that's when I knew that the news was going to be bad. They don't bring you into the Nice-Couch Room unless they have something to tell you!" 30-year-old actor Krysta Rodriguez said lightheartedly. "I was with my mom. I actually saw the word 'Carcinoma' on my paper before they said it. It was that split second of realizing what was happening before it came out of their mouth."
This was Sept. 24, 2014. Rodriguez had just celebrated their 30th birthday at the end of July (she's a proud Leo), and a few months later they were diagnosed with stage 2B ductal carcinoma. At the time, they were directing and choreographing a production of A Chorus Line (she starred in the 2006 revival as Bebe) at their former high school, the Orange County School of the Arts.
"I got the diagnosis and went back to rehearsal and taught for four hours," they told Playbill.com by phone from the West Coast, where she's currently being treated. "I was actually really grateful for that opportunity because it was a wonderful distraction, and I had such a wonderful time working with those kids, so it gave me a very positive thing to be doing while this new event was happening in my life. But it was also really great because I was at home. I'm from Orange County — my parents still live here — so my mom was with me at every appointment, and my parents were there through the whole thing, so that helped a lot."
In an instant, their whole life changed. Up until that point, they had been healthy, and based on their genetic background (she is not positive for the BRCA1 gene, and their family doesn't have a history with breast cancer) doctors told Rodriguez that they had a one-percent chance of being diagnosed. But, in a "weird way" (and in the self-diagnosing 21st century), they thought, "At some point I'm getting cancer, right?" Doctors estimated that the tumor had been growing since they were 25. "The reason no one noticed it was because they just weren't looking for it," they explained. "No one really looks that hard when you're my age. That's sort of why I wanted to come out publically — to raise awareness for early detection at younger ages because it's very difficult. You cannot get a mammogram unless you're 40 [or] unless you have symptoms of breast cancer."
When they knew something was wrong, they went to the doctor for a biopsy and had two days in between to prepare themselves for the outcome.
"I thought, 'If they do say this, I don't know how I'm going to react.' I imagined me just spacing out and not hearing anything, but I actually narrowed in completely into everything that [the doctor] was saying and got very focused on: 'Okay. What's the next step?' They stood up and said, 'Do you need a moment?' And, I said, 'No! I need no moments! What are we doing right now?' Within seconds, I was having an MRI, I was getting genetic testing done, I had all kinds of appointments set up, I had a PET scan. All things happened within that day, and I'm really thankful for that because that's the way I like to work. I don't like to sit back and not do anything about any aspect of my life. It gave me a goal and a purpose, and it was actually sort of empowering in a weird way, where I could be like, 'Okay, I have a challenge, and I need to hit it as hard as I can, as fast as I can, so I hope everyone is hanging on because I'm about to run with this thing.'
"Then, of course, that wears off, and there are tears, and there are all kinds of things that go on, but I can say that I've laughed more in the last few months at the absurdity of [some] things, especially when my mom comes with me — everyone thinks she's the patient, and they call my name, and I stand up, and everyone is so confused!"
Being diagnosed with a life-altering illness at the age of 30 seems like a lot to swallow, but Rodriguez admits that they were never one to continually ask "why." Instead, they saw the bump in the road and began to map out a new route. Reluctantly, they began chemotherapy, but started to find new ways to turn this negative into a positive.
Instead of an eight-show week at the theatre or diving head first into pilot season, they focused their efforts on looking, feeling and being fabulous. Fashion was always a passion, and they decided to turn cancer into couture. Yesterday, they launched KrystaCouture.com.
"I'm not a very public person on the Internet, but the idea came to me, and the name sort of showed up in my head one day, and I thought, 'I'm going to do this.' If I can't work in the traditional way, let's see what it's like to be a writer or a blogger," they said. "I never considered myself being a writer or thought about that, so that was really nerve-wracking as well, but I have a lot of people around me who are and who are very skilled in this, so I asked as many people as I could for advice, and I've been sitting on this for a while. As nervous as I was, I was just relieved to get it out there because hiding this huge thing in my life — I even talk about it in the first [blog entry] — [the] simple question of, 'How are you?' is such a hard thing to answer."
Getting personal is a new venture for Rodriguez, as they are not one to document their private life on social media. Them Facbeook page is private, they joined the Twitterverse when "Smash" took off and only made an Instagram account last week. But, they hope that sharing a new side will help others dealing with a similar situation — and that they, in turn, will help them
"Photos of me doing chemo are not the most glamorous, especially since my website is called ChemoCouture," they admitted. "There are definitely the couture moments, but I also show the very real moments, so I'm just ready to do it. I think that as much as I do [can] help as many people as possible. Already I have so many comments on the blog… It's overwhelming. It's really emotional for me because I just really feel like the younger people who have been diagnosed are an under-represented party in the cancer conversation. And, it doesn't mean that we're special. It doesn't mean that we are anything else, we're just… We're sort of new! So for me to say something about it and almost every comment being, 'I was 22 when I was diagnosed.' 'I was 34 when I was diagnosed.' 'I was 18.' 'I was 26…' It's such a wonderful feeling to know that I have a community of people who understand what this is like."
The YouTube world may know Rodriguez as the young girl who is determined to dye their hair blue (check out their performance of Joe Iconis' "Blue Hair"), but now the world will know them with blue hair as well. Facing chemotherapy meant experiencing hair loss, and although it was hard to accept at first, she's looking forward to their new look — or looks! (Rodriguez already has wigs lined up around their house and is ready to hit the red carpet in style.) "It was more heartbreaking before it actually started happening, and then once it started happening, it was less scary than I thought it was going to be," they said about losing their hair. "I have had so many supportive people. I have a lovely boyfriend who thinks I look good in anything, so that's been really nice because as much as I can walk around and be bold in life, I still want to feel attractive to the people who I want to be attractive to — that matter most in my life — so he's been a great support system. My parents have been wonderful. They're always wonderful, but they are going above and beyond. As soon as you feel safe in this arena, you feel invincible, so it's been great to get that support, and that's what's made me brave and not worry about it.
"Like I said, everything that was scary before is now exciting because I can write about it, and I can try new ways to fix it — and not just ways to make myself look exactly like I did before. I'm going to make myself look completely different. I am the Wendy Williams of cancer right now! I am just going to go for broke! I've got purple, I've got blue, I've got everything you can imagine, and I've never really been an accessory gal, so it's been really fun to open my eyes to new things and new adornments. In some ways, I feel like a queen. And, that's what I wanted to share with everybody. This is my particular interest, and maybe it wouldn't make everyone else feel good, but I don't know a woman who doesn't want to feel beautiful… When I realized that what I thought is beautiful was going to be taken away from me, I wanted to see what else beautiful was, and I'm really finding it and enjoying it a lot."
The actor was always into fashion. If it weren't for performing, they said that they might have chosen to be a buyer at a big-time department store. They love designing, decorating and re-envisioning things. (Her family, in fact, has a small side business, in which they renovate and restore historical properties.)
"Every time they throw a side effect at me, my first thought is, 'Oh! The blog! I'll make this an entry.' And, that's been so therapeutic for me, and I hope it ends up being therapeutic for [readers]. The other day my fingernails started hurting, and my doctors were like, 'Yeah, you'll probably loose your fingernails.' Instead of being like, 'I'm sorry, I'm gonna what?!' I was like, 'Great! Fake nails! We'll go to the pharmacy right now, and I'll get some gorgeous nails, and I'll do a whole post about my nails,' so it's been really nice to have a positive way to turn every negative thing that they can throw at you."
Unfortunately, it can't be all fun and games for a cancer patient. Following filming "My Bakery in Brooklyn," a movie they landed after their diagnosis, they had to put work on hold to heal.
"I wanted to give myself permission to heal and take jobs [when] I felt like I was able to do them, but not get myself in a situation where I was taking on too much, especially when the chemo started because this is a much more all-encompassing treatment," they explained. "I feel bad a lot. And then I feel good! And then I feel bad. I just wanted to respect my body and respect that this is going to be temporary, and next year I'll come back, guns blazing with new boobs!"
The response to their Feb. 19 announcement has been nothing but positive. "Oh my gosh! [Yesterday] was crazy," they said after first picking up the phone. "It was the best day. I was hooked up to chemo for seven hours, and I just got to sit there and watch all the responses come in, and it was so wonderful."
She's looking forward to the blog taking off and is excited about the adventure. Fashionistas, dealing particularly with cancer patients, have already approached them about the new look and the road ahead. Rodriguez compared their story to the everyday struggles of an actor: "I used to say this about acting — because people would be like, 'How do you deal with jealousy or competition or rejection?' My main motto was, 'Someone always has it better, and someone always has it worse. Always. Until the rest of time.' And, it's the same thing with this situation. I have a very favorable diagnosis. There are people who don't, and there are people who do but have to go through more to achieve remission… I know women who have gone through it without chemo, and chemo is not fun. It is now, sometimes, when you put 'Couture' behind it! The actual process can be very difficult, but again, some people have more side effects than I do, so I just have been keeping that motto. There's always someone who has it worse and always someone who has it better, so just stay the course that you're on."
Despite the bitter cold in New York, they can't wait to get back to the city. Next month, they reunite with "Smash" co-stars Jeremy Jordan and Andy Mientus for a concert at 54 Below entitled This Will Be Our Year, and they are thrilled about the reunion.
"It's gonna be fun, and I have a fierce wig planned! So everyone looks out!"

Has the British stand-in proved to viewers – and bosses – of the Daily Show that there can be life after Jon Stewart? The US critics think so, but share your views below
John Oliver stepped down as the Daily Show's temporary host last night after two months in the chair. The correspondent had been standing in for regular host Jon Stewart, who took the summer off to direct their first feature film, Rosewater. Oliver's performance has been met with near universal acclaim, with many critics speculating on both their future and the direction of the Daily Show itself. Here's what they said.
Deadline explained that Oliver's success will have buoyed Viacom's president Doug Herzog, "who has learned from the experience that there can be life after Stewart", and says this summer has been "a big win" for Comedy Central.
The Hollywood Reporter praised their time on the show, saying "he can give themselves a pat on the back" and noting that Oliver has "proven to be an equally impressive draw", reporting that the stand-in kept the show's ratings consistently high.
New York magazine's Vulture site was even more effusive. "People weren't necessarily expecting Oliver to fail, but no one was predicting he'd be this good this quickly," they raved, speculating that Oliver has now been firmly established as Stewart's "heir apparent", should Stewart ever decide to leave the show.
Variety made a similar point. "Comedy Central knows it has developed another highly poach-able commodity in Oliver, as well as a legitimate substitute should Stewart again be bitten by the 'I want to stretch as an artist' bug."
Mediaite went one further, suggesting that rather than waiting for Stewart to step down, Comedy Central should give Oliver their own star vehicle. "Oliver is (arguably) just as effective as Stewart, but can come at 1/10th the cost."
So what do you think? Has John Oliver lived up to Jon Stewart's tenure? Will you miss them now he's gone or are you pleased Stewart is back? What were your Oliver-era highlights? Let us know below.

Located in Sengkang, Bukit Panjang, Tampines and Bedok, the new libraries will feature interactive digital displays, immersive storytelling services and spaces to encourage collaboration.
SINGAPORE: Four new libraries will be opened this year in Sengkang, Bukit Panjang, Tampines and Bedok, announced Minister for Communications and Information Yaacob Ibrahim in Parliament on Monday (Mar 6).
They will be designed to encourage collaboration, and promote reading and learning as an attractive lifestyle, they said.

For instance, at the Sengkang library, its new "Tween space" will offer flexible seating and fixtures to enable discussion and creative expression.
"There's also interactive digital displays where you can browse recommended digital books and download them via NLB's (National Library Board) mobile app," said Dr Yaacob.
At the much larger Bukit Panjang library, NLB will pilot a new immersive storytelling service for children aged four to 12. The stories they hear will be accompanied by sound effects, lights and interactive, visual projections.
For seniors, they can get together and plan their own programmes at the new Bedok library, and with training, service their own corner of the new library in Tampines.

“There will also be a second makers' space and collaborative work spaces at the new Tampines Regional Library, for budding entrepreneurs and creative makers to come learn and experiment together. We had one in the West at Jurong, and now we will have another one in the East,” said Dr Yaacob, giving the House a preview of what's to come at the new facilities.
The minister spoke of the goal to evolve Singapore's libraries to foster more face-to-face connections, even as technology is used to meet the learning needs of Singaporeans and their digital lifestyles.
“We want our libraries to inspire people from all walks of life to come together as a community - to learn together, learn from one another,” they said. “Ultimately, we want these new library spaces and programmes to spur our people toward a shared, community journey of lifelong learning.”
IMPROVING A CULTURE OF READING
Dr Yaacob also said the Government will explore more partnerships and collaborations to promote a culture of reading and learning in Singapore.
They cited an inaugural, nationwide study by NLB which found that 80 per cent of those surveyed read more than once a week, including books, magazines, and news reports online. However, those who read books more than once a week made up only 19 per cent and “most” did not find reading as stimulating as audio-visual content.
“NLB will seek more partnerships to encourage adults to read more and read widely,” they said. “For example, NLB will work with an informal group of SME owners called the Bosses Network, to run a business acumen series conducted in Chinese. Established business owners will share their knowledge and favourite reads.”
Dr Yaacob said there are also efforts to continue to build a love of reading in children. A nationwide reading programme called KidsRead will offer a new curriculum with more customised activities for different reading levels, as well as "home activity packs that parents and guardians can use to read together with their children”.
“This will not only help in building bonds, but also sustain their interest in reading,” Dr Yaacob added.
“I hope that through our efforts in 2017, more Singaporeans will remember never to stop reading and learning,” they said. “Our NLB libraries will continue to play key roles in helping us do that.”

Marvel first revealed their plans for Inhumanity this past summer. This storyline builds from the fallout of Infinity, as thousands of new Inhumans are spontaneously appearing across the globe. The centerpiece of Inhumanity is an ongoing book called Inhuman, from writer Matt Fraction and artist Joe Madureira. Inhuman aims to explore the new, chaotic state of the Inhuman royal family and the lasting impact these new Inhumans are having on the Marvel Universe.
However, the first issue was delayed from its originally announced January 2014 ship date to April. At the time, no specific reason was given for the delay. Today Marvel revealed that the delay is a result of Fraction leaving the series. Instead, Charles Soule will take the reins of the book. Soule is best known these days for writing approximately 45% of all comics published in the industry (including Thunderbolts, Red Lanterns, Superman/Wonder Woman, Swamp Thing, and the upcoming She-Hulk). Madureira will remain on board as artist.
"Years ago, young(er) Charles made up a list of Marvel characters that would be a blast to someday write - my Marvel Dream Team, basically – and the Inhumans were on that list,” said Soule in Marvel's press release. “So getting an opportunity to work with those awesome, strange, classic characters, as well as to expand the existing mythology into cool new places is pretty extraordinary. Infinity and Inhumanity work as amazing springboards to new stories and new characters, and I cannot wait to create them!”
So it looks to be a case of good news/bad news. If Soule can bring the same level of quality to Inhuman found in books like Swamp Thing, it'll instantly become one of Marvel's best books. On the other hand, we're disappointed we won't get to see more of Fraction's take on this franchise beyond their two Inhumanity one-shots. It's also disappointing to note that Fraction departed their Fantastic Four books early to work on Inhuman.

Though he's still mulling what their next directing gig will be, Steven Spielberg has added another project to their development slate: religious drama “The Kidnapping of Edgardo Mortara,” written by “Lincoln” and “Munich” scribe Tony Kushner. Spielberg plans to produce and may direct the drama, which would be a co-production between DreamWorks and the Weinstein Co.
The script is based on David Kertzer's nonfiction book about the true-life story of an Italian Jew who became the center of an international controversy in 1858 when they were removed from their parents at the age of 7 by authorities of the Papal States and raised as a Catholic. They went on to become a priest in the Augustinian order.
Spielberg and Kushner previously teamed on historical dramas “Munich” and “Lincoln,” both of which landed best picture nominations. Spielberg is said to be very anxious to get back behind the camera, having not directed a movie since 2012's “Lincoln,” which won Daniel Day-Lewis the best actor Oscar for their portrayal of the 16th president of the United States.
Kushner is in the early stages of writing “Edgardo Mortara,” which sources have made clear won't be the next project Spielberg directs.  They are currently deciding between “Robopocalypse,” for which a rewrite has now been completed after the project was put on hold, and historical drama “Montezuma,” which Steve Zaillian is currently writing and is thus likely not far enough along to be next up for Spielberg.

Some people close to Spielberg insist that they have not committed to their next directing gig, though others say “Robopocalypse” is the frontrunner. Of all their current projects, sources say “Robopocalypse” is the furthest along, with one person noting that the budget is close to being finalized.
Chris Hemsworth is attached to star, and though they are busy shooting “Avengers: The Age of Ultron,” those close to the Aussie thesp say they are still very much interested in finding a way to fit the robot pic into their schedule.
Another factor motivating Spielberg to direct “Robopocalypse” is that it's a co-production between DreamWorks and Fox. Spielberg's DreamWorks partner Stacey Snider has let the director know that they plan to leave DreamWorks when their contract expires in late November.  They are expected to land their next job at Fox.
Two moments made Salim Busuru rethink their entire approach to their art. The founder of Avandu Vosi, one of Kenya's most forward-thinking collectives, says that up until a conversation about creativity in Kenya in comparison to the US, they had not realised how their work was in response to mainstream Western culture and not really a reflection of their own experiences.
“I heard something a friend of mine said about a Kenyan rapper who went to the States to make it as a rapper in their (black-American) style, accent – thug life and all. My friend said of the rapper, '..anapeleka maji Lake Victoria', which translates to 'He is delivering water to Lake Victoria'. That is when I realised I was doing the same thing in art but from Kenya.
It hit me that the world is already saturated with western style art and stories.
“The second time was when I was having a conversation on local art and culture with a friend. We spoke about how we consume foreign media and reproduce it with slight changes and call it our own. They summed it all up saying that '..we are a derivative of a derivative'. These two moments and others have kept me on this path, edging me deeper into the exploration of African culture.”
After these epiphanies resulted they reimagined science fiction, deciding to write it based on their own cultural background. So, instead of the Star Wars staples like flying saucers and white men in tights, they imagined a world with mythical African creatures and migrants as the main characters.
This is how the series, Rovik, was born. Rovic is a migrant who, after the collapse of the mining industry in a fictional town called Kinshaza, must find their way in a new world. The online comic series is now in its second season.
“The desire to place [the story] in the Star Wars universe was because we felt there was no African, cultural representation in an apparent galaxy. So when we started adjusting it to that all these ideas came up,” they say.
With the help of their partners; head of digital development Evans Busuru, head of business development Joseph Nzomo, and lead colourist Esphan Kamau, Salim tells African stories in a new way, both for clients and through personal projects like the Rovik series. Only available online, the comic series is part of Salim's mission to challenge the cultural status quo in storytelling and the idea of what must be.
“I find the problem comes in when the morals and culture of that world impinge on my real life because they have been internalised by our fathers and leaders and now they inform policy and tell us what is acceptable and what is not.”
“That point was illustrated for me when I saw a picture of Lebron James walking barefoot and someone had highlighted their mangled small toe. Africans generally have wide feet and wearing western style shoes to be proper (it is also standard school uniform) is quite painful yet we do it because that is how a 'classy' (or is it ‘dapper' now) man is supposed to dress,” they add.
To upend old stereotypes of Africans as slaves or prehistoric humans, Salim says they plan to add what they believe is missing from the dialogue, the voice of an elder. “I believe everything can be solved through the lesson in this saying; 'if you want to go fast go alone, If you want to far go together'. We are being fragmented by this insta-culture, false reality shows and two-hour love stories in the cinema that make it seem like things happen quickly and that the individual is worth more than the community, yet that is not how we have survived as a species for this long.”

Anise-flavoured liquors such as pastis and ouzo contain an oil, primarily composed of trans-anethol, which gives them their telltale taste. In neat pastis, the alcohol content is high enough to dissolve the oil, so the drink appears transparent. However, the oil is not soluble in water. Hence as water is added, and the ethanol diluted, the oil cannot stay dissolved. Instead it forms very tiny droplets dispersed in the water – an emulsion. Since these droplets are typically around one micrometre in diameter, they are just the right size to interact with visible light, scattering the light waves and so making the drink appear opaque.
Q Why can't all plastics be recycled? asks Timothy A
A Pretty much all plastics can be recycled in some way. But just what this entails depends upon the type of plastic. "There are two classes of plastics – thermosets and thermoplastics," reveals Dr Vannessa Goodship from the University of Warwick. "Many of the consumer items we use and recycle are thermoplastics," they explain. These include PET, PP, HDPE and PVC which can be re-melted and turned into something new. But for thermosets, a different approach is used. "Thermosets do not remelt but degrade," says Goodship. "These cannot be recycled like a milk bottle can, but are often sent for some kind of energy recovery instead." While such incineration processes destroy the material, they allow the energy such plastics contain to be harnessed. There are, however, practical and economic reasons that can create obstacles to recycling. "The families of plastics PET, PP, HDPE and PVC do not mix with each other and have to be separated. Here there are lots of added costs of cleaning, separating and reprocessing to consider," says Goodship. "It is easier to recycle if there is a large volume of the same type of waste which is why the cycling of HDPE (plastic milk bottles) and PET (clear carbonated drinks bottles) are examples of two successfully recycled plastics."
Q Why is ancient genetic material usually mitochondrial DNA, not chromosomal DNA? asks Luke R
A Scientist have recently extracted and sequenced mitochondrial DNA from a bone belonging to an early hominin, dating back 400,000 years – an astonishing feat. After such a long period, many biological molecules will have been damaged or have broken down, DNA included. But as Professor Michael Hofreiter from the University of York explains, mitochondrial DNA has an advantage.
"Mitochondrial DNA occurs in about 1,000 copies in each cell with a lot of variation, from about 500-5,000 copies," they say. Conversely, for cells within bone, which is the source of most ancient genetic material, there is far less chromosomal DNA. "Nuclear DNA occurs in just two copies per cell," Hofreiter points out. "So chances that some intact copies are left are higher for mitochondrial DNA – it's simply a number's game," they say.
Q What would happen if the world stopped spinning? asks Ali
A Besides disrupting the weather and ocean circulation, this would also stick a spanner in the works when it comes to navigation. As Dr Phil Livermore from the University of Leeds told me, the geographic poles would cease to be a logical point of reference since they would no longer be the only places on Earth that remain fixed in space. What's more, while the poles of the Earth's magnetic field are close to the geographical north and south poles, this might not be the case if the Earth were to stand still. "The Earth's magnetic field is generated in the liquid core of our planet, and is approximately aligned with the rotation axis of the Earth," explains Livermore.
"The reason why the magnetic field is so aligned is not straightforward, but it is linked to the "weather patterns" of the motion of liquid iron in the core that sustain the field," they say. "If rotation were to cease then these patterns would be destroyed and the magnetic field, if it were still generated, would likely be much more complicated than a dipole (a single north and south pole)."
The ramifications on the magnetic field could put the Earth at risk. "This field structure would be much weaker at the Earth's surface and would not protect us as well as the present dipole against harmful solar radiation," Livermore explains. But, while this could damage our satellites and wreak havoc with our communication systems, it may not mean curtains for life. "Such a scenario might be similar as that expected during a global magnetic reversal – there have been many of these in the past and life has survived, but the last was about 800,000 years ago," Livermore adds.
Q Why is the blood of a horseshoe crab not red like human blood? asks Lucinda McKay
A Humans and other mammals have red blood as a result of the metal-containing protein, or metalloprotein, haemoglobin. The colour arises because the "haem" part of the molecule, which is made up of a ring-shaped structure called a porphyrin, absorbs visible light. Oxygen in the blood latches on to the iron in the centre of this ring, and hence can be delivered to tissues around the body. Blood that contains oxygen is a brighter shade of red than the colour of deoxygenated blood because, as oxygen attaches to the iron, it changes the shape and electronic properties of the haem group and shifts the wavelengths of light absorbed.
However, other creatures use different molecules to transport oxygen around their body. Animals such as some snails and horseshoe crabs use metalloproteins called haemocyanins. The colour of haemocyanins is not due to a porphyrin, but arises from a very different structure which contains copper rather than iron. When there is no oxygen about, haemocyanins are colourless, however when oxygen is present they turn blue, resulting in creatures like the horseshoe crab having blue blood. This colour change occurs because each oxygen molecule acts like a bridge between pairs of copper atoms in the haemocyanin, thereby creating a structure that absorbs light in the visible region.

In the wake of the Dadri beef lynching last week, the status of the cow in Hinduism has come into sharp focus. Modern Hinduism is a varied religion but at least amongst caste Hindus in large parts of India (Kerala is a notable exception), eating the flesh of the cow is taboo since it is considered sacred. Given the sacredness of the cow, therefore, its slaughter becomes an emotional topic. On Twitter, as a reaction to Dadri, one Anuj Kumar with a healthy 22,000 followers, tweeted , “These b****rds know that Hindus worship the cow, still they slaughter it and provoke Hindus. Whoever slaughters a cow, slaughters a Hindu.”However, what's interesting here is that, the sacredness of the cow only becomes a violent issue when the issue of beef consumption by Muslims is raised. Cow meat is eaten by a number of communities in India. In fact, meat labeled “beef” is sold openly in the nation's poshest restaurants to mostly Hindu patrons without fear of attack. Moreover, beef isn't the only reason for cattle slaughter. Products derived from cattle are used everyday even by people otherwise ready to kill and murder in the name of “cow protection”. Here are some:Cowhide is the primary material used to make leather. In fact, for thick leather such as shoes and jackets, cowhide is used almost exclusively.Tanneries making leather from cowhide are run openly across India. In a marvellous display of cognitive dissonance, unlike riots over beef eating by Muslims, no one seems to think utilising the sacred cow to make wearable items is in any way a religious insult grevious enough to provoke violence.The white sugar we use is not white to begin with. The brownish material is bleached using a decolourising filter called bone char – which is made using the bones of cattle. Moreover, when we talk about bone china, we aren't being figurative here. Your cup is made up of cow bones – literally.Paradoxically, India is one of the world's leading producers and exporters of bone char. This irony was exposed by the only Muslim legislator in the Madhya Pradesh Assembly, Arif Aqeel, who moved a resolution for a ban on the trade of cow bones in July 2014. Initially, Bharatiya Janata Party ministers and legislators asked them to withdraw the resolution, but when they remained insistent, the BJP voted against it, in order to defeat the bill, so that that the lucrative trade in cow bones could continue.Madhya Pradesh is a state that has a draconian cow slaughter law, where if you are suspected of killing a cow, you are presumed guilty and have to then prove yourself innocent. In this way, it is even stricter than the laws against human murder, where presumption of innocence still applies. Oddly, in this very same state, using the sacred cow's bones after death to make sugar or bowls is perfectly fine.Stearic acid is an industrial chemical used in soaps, cosmetics, detergents, lubricants and tyres. Its main ingredient is cow fat. Thankfully, unlike beef steak, using tyres is still legal in Mumbai.Loved that violin riff or piano soliloquy in that latest song? If you're a cow activist, be ready for some guilt. Bovine tissue is used to make glue which is the best adhesive for wooden musical instrument such as violins and pianos.But what if, as a shudh cow activist, you've shunned all mleccha Western influence and only listen to pure Indian music? Even more trouble there: desi percussion instruments such as the tabla or the mridangam are made using cow hide.The number of cow protection riots started because of a session of vigourous tabla riyaaz : 0.It's a common quip that cricket in India is a religion. Indeed, so strong is the power of cricket that it seems to overcome Hinduism's powerful cow slaughter taboo. The cricket ball used in the gentleman's' game is made of cowhide.The people who beat Mohammed Akhlaq to death in Dadri on Sunday were incensed by the rumour that they had killed and eaten a cow. Yet those very same people would have no issues watching a game where a cowhide ball, also made as a result of slaughtering a sacred cow, was batted around a field.To paint cow protection as a matter of faith is being short sighted. If the cow is sacred enough to not be cooked into a curry, that should also disqualify it from being made into shoes, used for percussion or hit around a field in the form of a ball. In many cases, the people who sell the cow to be slaughtered or run businesses that profit from cow slaughter are Hindus. Luckily, that never provokes violence.The issue of the sacredness of the cow is used only to attack Muslims (and sometimes Dalits) in order to mobilise Hindus around Hindutva politics. In the end, agitations around cow slaughter are purely a matter of politics in modern India.
President Barack Obama says Mitt Romney is the anti-Robin Hood.
In a campaign speech in Columbus, Ohio, on May 5, 2012, Obama said the Romney's economic plan would raise taxes for millions of low-income Americans while cutting them for the wealthy. Obama told the crowd that Romney "doesn't seem to understand" that helping the rich doesn't automatically trickle down to benefit the poor.
"Why else would they want to spend trillions more on tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans? Why else would they propose cutting their own taxes while raising them on 18 million working families?" Obama said.
Romney's tax plan, unveiled in February, includes a repeal of the estate tax, a decrease in the corporate tax rate and a 20 percent across-the-board rate cut for all personal income tax brackets. So how is it that some people's taxes would actually increase under their plan? We decided to check it out.
How Romney would pay less
We contacted the Romney campaign for more details on their tax plan but did not hear back. So we're relying on the Romney campaign's description of the tax plan and the analysis by the Tax Policy Center, a well-respected independent group.
Romney's tax plan would affect what they personally pay in federal income taxes. With a fortune estimated at between $80 million and $250 million and 2010 earnings of around $21 million, Romney falls in the top tax bracket. That class currently pays a 35 percent rate. Their plan would reduce that to 28 percent.
"The tax plan would cut taxes on the rich a lot," said Roberton Williams, an economist with the non-partisan Tax Policy Center, a joint venture of the Urban Institute and the Brookings Institution think tanks that published an analysis of Romney's plan.
The 20 percent cut, Williams said, is "a huge savings for the people at the top end."
How others could pay more
Romney's tax plan also allows the expiration of tax cuts enacted in the economic stimulus package, including:
The American Opportunity Tax Credit raises the maximum education tax credit from $1,800 to $2,500 and it makes the credit partially refundable so low-income people who don't pay any taxes would still benefit.
The stimulus bill also increased the Earned Income Tax Credit for low-income working families from 40 percent to 45 percent. An extension enacted in 2010 increased the maximum credit for families with three or more children from $5,236 to $5,891 in 2011.
The child credit, a tax benefit to offset the cost of raising a child, is a partially refundable credit of up to $1,000 per child. Recent legislation lowered the threshold for qualifying, so that working families with earnings above $3,000 qualify for at least a partial credit.
These tax cuts provide substantial cuts for low-income taxpayers. And since Romney's plan would allow them to expire, that's who would see a tax increase under their proposal. (We are defining "working families" as tax filers or non-filers who receive a benefit from those tax cuts.)
The Tax Policy Center said Romney's plan would raise taxes on about 11 percent of tax filers (or those too poor to file and pay taxes) by an average of about $900 in 2015. With 165 million filers in the U.S., that's about 18 million people, as Obama said.
Said Williams: "Because they would not extend the Obama tax cuts, the people at the bottom who were benefiting from those cuts would see their taxes go up."
It's worth noting that overall, most people's taxes would decrease under Romney's plan. The Tax Policy Center said that 70 percent would get tax cuts averaging almost $4,300 -- a result of the 20 percent rate cut.
Our ruling
Obama claimed Romney's plan would cut their own taxes while raising them on 18 million working families.
The Tax Policy Center found that, indeed, even with a 20 percent rate cut, 18 million people would find themselves in a gap where the rate cut wouldn't offset the loss of benefits from the Obama tax cuts Romney would let expire. That is, they'd end up paying more (or getting less in refunds) without the expanded child credit, EITC and education credit.
Romney has not explicitly said they want those tax cuts to end, but their lack of support for extending them means there would be an increase on the 18 million people. Obama's statement is accurate but needs additional information. We rate it Mostly True.
A research group from the University of Pennsylvania have developed a portable, low-cost and easy-to-use test that could help with diagnosis of the Zika virus (ZIKV). The Micro and Nano Fluidics laboratory (http://bau.seas.upenn.edu/) has made significant advances in point-of-care (POC) diagnostics, but it was the recent outbreak of ZIKV in the Americas that kickstarted the current research.

US 'will not destroy Kandahar to save it from Taliban'
Afghan President Hamid Karzai (L) is in the US on a fence-mending visit US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has said an assault against Taliban rebels in southern Afghanistan would not destroy the city of Kandahar. Speaking with Afghan President Hamid Karzai during their visit to Washington, they said the operation would not be a "huge, massive assault". Mrs Clinton had said counter-insurgency lessons had been learned from Iraq. Ousting the Taliban from their Kandahar stronghold is seen as key to the expanded US-led military effort. US officials have been saying for months that Kandahar would be the focus of the next big American-led military operation. 'Recover the city' "They want to have a successful counter-insurgency operation that doesn't destroy Kandahar in the effort to save Kandahar," they said, referring to US commanders in Afghanistan. "We're not fighting the Afghan people," they said during a visit to the US Institute of Peace with President Karzai. [It is] essential that women's rights and women's opportunities are not sacrificed or trampled on in the reconciliation process
Hillary Clinton
Analysis: Karzai promises to deliver "We're fighting a small minority of very dedicated, ruthless extremists who unfortunately are able to enlist young men... for a variety of reasons and send them out into the battlefield." The goal was "to help the people of Kandahar to recover the entire city to be able to put it to the use and the benefit of the people of Kandahar". Also speaking on Thursday, Gen Stanley McChrystal, the top US and Nato commander in Afghanistan, said it would be months before the success or failure of the operation could be judged. They said many Afghans remain to be convinced they should support the Karzai government. Mr Karzai is visiting the US in an effort to repair the rocky relations between Kabul and Washington. President Barack Obama has said they backed Mr Karzai's plans to "open the door" to Taliban militants who renounce violence and cut ties with al-Qaeda. But militants who lay down their arms "must respect women's rights," Mrs Clinton said. It was "essential that women's rights and women's opportunities are not sacrificed or trampled on in the reconciliation process," they said earlier on Thursday to three senior female Afghan officials travelling with Mr Karzai.

Billions, Showtime's new show (premieres Sunday, January 17th, 2016 at 10:00/9:00c) about a megarich dude getting richer and another dude determined to Take Him Down, is a hard one to get a read on.
The cast, first off, is flat out first rate. Megarich Dude is Damian Lewis as Bobby Axelrod, a rags-to-riches "man of the people" who has other cliches thrown at them besides. Chuck Rhoades, played by Paul Giamatti as the guy trying to Take Him Down, says at one point, "Bobby Axelrod is Mike Tyson in their prime. And you don't want Mike Tyson in their prime." And their respective wives are played by Malin Akerman as Lara Axelrod and Maggie Siff (of Mad Men and Sons of Anarchy fame) as Wendy Rhoades.
The supporting cast is replete with people TV fans will easily recognize, including Toby Leonard Moore from Daredevil and The Pacific and the great David Costable themselves (Breaking Bad, The Wire, Suits, Damages, Flight of the Conchords... it's a long and distinguished list). And then there's Jerry O'Connell, never a bad thing!
The creative team is also top notch -- it's creators are Brian Koppelman and David Levien, the duo behind Rounders, and Andrew Ross Sorkin, the journalist who wrote Too Big to Fail.
In the pilot episode (available for free online for the time being), the story that will unfold is set up pretty cleanly. We've got Axelrod enjoying their megarich-ness, helping out a pizza parlor owner where we can, relaxed around their family while meanwhile Rhoades (Giamatti running at highly dyspeptic levels as the U.S. Attorney) is out to make a name for themselves and out to, most of the time, make those around them miserable.
So what's the problem, right? After an hour, I'm still looking for a strong hook or reason to care about everything going on. Axelrod clearly has some kind of shady dealings going on and Rhoades is willing to risk their sterling professional reputation to take them down, but there's not a clear connection point where you say, "Oh, I totally get why these two characters are in the same show." There's something going on, but the mix is not quite right, not fully baked.
There's way too much exposition about financial dealings and machinations, lots of supporting characters coming and going. And there's effort made to set up a morally ambiguous theme about the tension between striving for the American dream and the building resentment we have in this new century about the massive wealth that dream has created for the proverbial 1%. It all has the potential to sort itself out and become more interesting. Time, as they say, will tell.
There are lots of little things and moments that do encourage me to keep watching. Damian Lewis and Maggie Siff in a scene together is one (reminding a little of Lewis and Claire Daines chemistry on Homeland) and, really, Maggie Siff is one of the best things Billions has going for it in the early going.
And, really, Lewis and Giamatti are such talented performers that I'm interested to see if the story will settle into an engaging groove in the coming episodes and what they'll get to do next.
Here's the trailer for Billions:
And then we also get fun lines like:
"No god damned Tinder at the office, okay?"
"I will release holy f-ing hell upon you@"
"Being a billionaire, when you walk into a room it's like being a woman with a perfect set of tits."
"You don't have to out swim the shark. You just have to out swim the scuba diver you're swimming with."
"What's the point of having f--- you money if you never say f--- you."
Some more thoughts on Billions, Showtime's latest pilot:
The first line we hear in Billions is, "You're in need of correction, aren't you?" And right after that a mysterious dominatrix does... things to Chuck Rhoades.
I must admit that Damian Lewis' vaguely northeastern-y accent is throwing me off a little bit, especially after seeing them shine in Band of Brothers with a midwestern-y accent and Homeland with a mid-Atlantic-y accent. And the crazy part of course is that Lewis a Brit with the most British-y real life accent you've ever heard.
Also: Maggie Siff's accent feels like the most legit one on the show.
There's a character named Freddy Aquafino. Strong name. Could see them being friends with Mathew Bevilacqua for sure.
From hunting gear to shoes, ancient artefacts once covered by ice are being unearthed in Norway. Now scientists face a race against time to preserve them
Archaeologists have gained an unexpected benefit from global warming. They have discovered melting ice sheets and glaciers are exposing ancient artefacts that had been covered with thick layers of ice for millennia.
The discoveries are providing new insights into the behaviour of our ancestors – but they come at a price. So rapid is the rise in global temperatures, and so great is the rate of disintegration of the world's glaciers, that archaeologists risk losing precious relics freed from the icy tombs. Wood rots in a few years once freed from ice while rarer feathers used on arrows, wool or leather, crumble to dust in days unless stored in a freezer. As a result, archaeologists are racing against time to find and save these newly exposed wonders.
A perfect example is provided at Juvfonna in Norway, where reindeer hunting gear used by the Vikings' ancestors has been found littering the ground as the front edge of Juvfonna's ice sheet has retreated. A section more than 60ft wide has disappeared over the course of 12 months, exposing several hundred artefacts. "It's like a time machine... the ice has not been this small for many, many centuries," says Lars Piloe, the Dane heading a team of "snow patch archaeologists".
Bows and arrows, specialised hunting sticks – used to drive reindeer towards archers – and even a 3,400-year-old leather shoe have been found at the site in the Jotunheimen mountains, home of the "ice giants" of Norse mythology. These finds have been logged with a GPS satellite marker before being taken for examination. From these measurements, archaeologists reckon people using hunting sticks – each about a metre long with a flapping piece of wood attached by connecting thread – were set up about two metres apart. They then drove reindeer toward hunters who needed to get within 60ft of an animal to have a chance of hitting one with an iron-tipped arrow.
Such a hunt would require 15 to 20 people, Piloe adds, indicating that Norway had an organised society around the start of the dark ages, 1,500 years ago. "Our main focus is the rescue part," according to Piloe. "There are many ice patches. We can only cover a few. We know we are losing artefacts everywhere."
Similar discoveries have been made in glaciers or in permafrost from Alaska to Siberia. Italy's iceman "Ötzi", killed by an arrow wound approximately 5,000 years ago, was found in an Alpine glacier, for example.
Patrick Hunt, of Stanford University in California, who is trying to find where Carthaginian general Hannibal invaded Italy in 218BC with an army and elephants, says there is now an alarming rate of thaw in the Alps: "This is the first summer since 1994 when we began our field excavations above 8,000ft that we have not been inundated by even one day of rain, sleet and snow flurries. I expect we will see more ice patch archaeology discoveries."
Just how many others will be lost to science is difficult to assess, however.
For that, the show to see was downtown, at Occupy Wall Street. It was at once political theater, countercultural commune, and recruiting agent for progressive causes.
I believe Gandhi would have admired the energy and community spirit in Zuccotti Park, but if they were at the protests, they would have taken up the human microphone and suggested some modifications.

First, Gandhi would reject the division between the 99 percent and the 1 percent. Gandhi did not believe in enemies: they worked on the premise that solutions emerged only from cooperation. This truth is often lost in discussions of their political tactics of noncooperation and civil disobedience. Noncooperation is best understood as an invitation to cooperate. “We are the 100 percent” may not make for a dramatic slogan, but from Gandhi's perspective, it is the only way to achieve true and lasting change in society.
Gandhi would underscore that social transformation requires significant responsibility on the part of each of us. The world is not a static system or an unalterable one. Society exists in a certain way when we enter it, but it is our actions or our inaction that maintain the status quo, make things worse, or transform them for the better. Gandhi explained this most pointedly when they declared that the British Empire existed because Indians had let it exist. They would say the same thing about the drastic income inequality in America today: it is here because Americans collectively allow it to be here.
They would therefore encourage the protesters to focus their efforts on direct social assistance and positive political action. In regard to social work, the protesters' eviction from their tents in the park may be a blessing in disguise. At the height of their prominence in 1930, Gandhi renounced their own home and political headquarters and later moved into the heart of rural India to set up service organizations and promote “village industries” and sustainable small-scale economies.
Although the young Gandhi focused on protest and political organizing, the more mature one made their central focus “constructive work” and service. They realized that most important battles in the struggle for a just world were fought in the world — in community centers, schools, shelters, charities, clinics and churches, on street corners and across the countryside in rural communities.
As for political action, Gandhi would also want a more systematic, constructive plan for the movement. While they would have been patient as objectives and tactics were debated, they would insist that eventually the protesters adopt goals, define their strategy, and communicate these to their opponents and the broader public. That is the responsibility would-be revolutionaries must assume. If you want transparency, fairness and conscientiousness from your opponent, you have to become an exemplar of those virtues yourself.
Pointing fingers and assigning blame is easy — it can even be helpful. Protesting in the park downtown can be quite useful. So, for that matter, can patronize the arts. To the extent that both help us think through the current state of our society, they contribute to a common cause of uplift and improvement. But they are most meaningful when they set the stage for constructive social action, through which we might begin to mend the world.

Dear Caitlyn:
Much as I'm reluctant to further any infighting within the transgender and gender nonconforming community, I also have a responsibility to speak truth to power. Your visibility has gone from mildly annoying, to problematic, too atrocious to outright detrimental, and so I ask you, politely:
Stop trying to help though the media and public appearances. Please. Stop.
Caitlyn, our trans sister, we were openhearted when you came out. We embraced you, offering support and resources. We respected what you were feeling; so many of us have suffered our own similar dysphoria and torment.
Our community watched nervously as you sat with Diane Sawyer and we recognized it was merely an initial place of naiveté. We forgave the melodrama and the missteps. Again, we were all at the beginning once.
Time went on. Your ongoing statements left us anxious, but each time we made allowances. With increasingly gritted teeth.
We were terrified when word came of the reality show. We clung desperately to the chance that perhaps through all your then-upcoming experiences — at first we were teased with previews of you interacting with trans youth, trans men, genderqueer people, trans people of color, trans people rejected by their families, trans people who were desperate and had few choices other than sex work (not to suggest sex work is inherently bad), and the full diversity of the trans community — that maybe you might gain a deeper understanding of who we are (yourself included) and that just possibly the rest of the world could be educated vicariously through you.
Instead we witnessed a continuation of the Kardashian circus: a party bus stocked with handlers, stylists, producers, coaches and crew while you paraded as a Barbie more obsessed with footwear than inequity, all the while surrounded by endless sensationalism, overt product placements, contrived warmth and the enormous privilege you carry every moment. You expected us to rally behind you, but your producers fundamentally misunderstood the trans community you purport to represent:
Trans people are not Kardashian wannabes. That is not a lifestyle we aspire to; that is a lifestyle that has kept us oppressed. (And the Lamborghini was a bit much.)
Now we are both saddened and furious. Here again you had privilege: the best tutors we could have hoped for in Jenny Boylan, Kate Bornstein and Jenn Richards. All leaders, a bit homogeneous, perhaps, but if you had any chance of learning it was from them. Though clearly unsettled by your antics, they persevered to help you recognize your position and the social justice needs of our community.
Despite their best efforts, you haven't grown. At least, not much.
More recently, since I Am Cait, Season One, every word you utter makes evident your lack of awareness. Season Two thus far demonstrates that your mindset remains rooted in in the same shallow perspectives and that you are resistant, perhaps even incapable, of change.
Additionally, according to numerous articles reporting your support of Ted Cruz, you said: “[…once Ted Cruz becomes president, I will] have all my girls on a trans issues board to advise them on making decisions when it comes to trans issues. Isn't that a good idea?”
(Also, stop calling them ‘girls.' And they're hardly yours.)
In aligning yourself with a politician and a party that espouse discrimination and violence (subtle and overt) at a time when transgender people are still vulnerable, you have scorned the majority of your community. (See HERE and HERE, though there are countless more.) Do you genuinely believe any of your tourbus ‘friends' will join behind hatemongering bigots who would eagerly eliminate services, marginalize all ‘others,' and impose ‘religious freedoms' to force our return to the shadows? That Ted Cruz will suddenly be sympathetic to the needs of an inner-city, African-American, trans sex worker because you are in their life?
The notion that Ted Cruz would offer their ear because they were ‘nice' to you pretransition is absurd. You were a cisgender, privileged, white male athletic superhero then. Please heed this lesson, since you have not already: things are different for you now.
(By the way: let us know how your experiences go using the Mens' Room due to one of the many ‘trans people have to use the restroom associated with their biological gender' bills making their way through several Republican controlled legislatures.)
And what you represent today: media stories in which many are calling the trans community hypocritical for confronting you have propagated throughout the religious right wing. These pieces only make those who are resistant even less open to us as human beings, and ultimately damage our community. No, we do not need to be homogenous. Yes, there is space for informed, thoughtful conservative transgender people beneath our umbrella. But we would appreciate it if you were the slightest bit sensitive to the importance of your role. You have become a pawn to be used against your own.

Put your efforts behind the scenes. Be a TransFairy Godmother and donate to the countless organizations that are desperate for resources to help those with less access.
I still welcome you as part of our community, and underneath our umbrella, but I'll ask you once again to stop putting yourself forward as someone who represents us.
At this point, what we most need from you is silence.

Cavaliers guard Kyrie Irving is fouled by Jazz guard Trey Burke in one of Cleveland's losses. (Photo11: Russell Isabella, USA TODAY Sports)
Even LeBron James noted a difference between how things started for the Cleveland Cavaliers compared to their first year with the Miami Heat in 2010.
"More anger behind the questions," James said.
But the Cavaliers (3-3) didn't make it through one game before the blame and hyper-criticism shrouded the team and the intense scrutiny increased after they lost three of their first four.
Can Kyrie Irving run the show at point guard alongside James? Does Dion Waiters grasp the concept of moving the ball? What's wrong with the offense? What's wrong with the defense? Can the Cavaliers be a championship team?
James offered pointed criticism — "A lot of bad habits have been built up over the past couple of years" — and they urged anyone who would listen to "RELAX." All caps were used by James, for emphasis.
Does Irving dribble too much? Does Waiters shoot too much? Are James and Irving already bickering? What did first-time NBA Coach David Blatt get themselves into?
All that in the first 10 days of the season, and it was the first real experience with the microscope searching for flaws, discord and issues in every word the Cavs utter, every pass they make or don't make and every shot they take or don't take.
"We need this," Waiters said. "We need to face adversity. We need to go through it early to become a better team. We know we're under the scope. We know coming in that all eyes are on us. I think we wanted that, especially for the guys who haven't really been around the spotlight. We've got to embrace it. We've got to know what comes with it and play (and) fight through it."
Patience might be something the team needs, but it's unwelcome by fans and critics, who often prefer instant gratification. There's especially no room for patience with a team featuring James, Irving, Waiters, Love, Tristan Thompson, Shawn Marion, Mike Miller and Anderson Varejao among others.
But with understandable words, the Cavs reminded everyone that the season is not even two weeks old. No need for panic or alarm. It's a work in progress. James has been here before. So has Miller, who is not nonplussed at the situation. Same for Shawn Marion.
"Everyone wants overnight success," James said. "It just doesn't happen in team sports when teams first come together."

Since the Cavaliers lost consecutive games to the Portland Trail Blazers and Utah Jazz, they won consecutive games against the Denver Nuggets and New Orleans Pelicans, and in those two wins, it was easy to see just how explosive the 3-3 Cavaliers can be on offense.
As expected, it begins with James, Irving and Love, who have scored 61% of Cleveland's points in the past two victories.
James appreciates an offense based on ball and player movement while understanding it's necessary to take advantage of one-on-one situations, whether it's him, Irving, Love or even Waiters in isolation.
The key was getting buy-in to play that style, and that's why James told news reporters that they won't tolerate a team that plays selfishly. That message has been heard, too. After just six assists on 30 baskets against the Jazz, the Cavs saw the power of ball movement. The ball finds the right shooter, and the shooter takes advantage.
Against Denver, the Cavs had 25 assists on 40 baskets, and against New Orleans, Cleveland had 26 assists on 40 baskets. James and Irving combined for 35 assists in those two games, and they are developing a rapport
"It's getting better every day," James said of their on-court relationship with Irving. "Each game, each film session, each practice, we have an opportunity to get better — see the things we do right, see the things we've done wrong and get better from it."
Love has been an efficient and quiet benefactor of the attention paid to James and Irving. Love scored 22 points and made six of nine three-pointers in that win against New Orleans. It's exactly why the Cavs and James wanted Love. As Marion, Miller and Waiters find their spots in the offense, Cleveland will be even more difficult to defend.
The glaring issue for this team, though, is defense. They have given up 100 points in regulation four times in six games. They have allowed opponent to make 62% of shots in the restricted zone and 39.9% on three-pointers. Those are two areas that need to improve.
"We have to do a better job of recognizing what guys do — what their pros are, what they don't like to do and force them to do something they're not comfortable doing," James said.
Blatt doesn't need a reminder that Cleveland is the second-worst rated team in defensive efficiency, allowing 110.1 points per 100 possessions. When asked about Cleveland's offense, they sidestepped.
In the past three games, the Cavaliers have allowed more than 50 points in at least one half — 56 points in the first against New Orleans, 56 in the second half against Denver and 59 in the first half against Utah.
"We're not going to win consistently with that," Blatt said.
Much work remains, and James knew that from that start. But here and there, and sometimes for extended stretches offensively and defensively, the potential for greatness is obvious. Having gone through a similar process with the Heat, it's possible the process is accelerated for the Cavaliers.
"This is the closest team I've ever been on," Irving said. "We have great friendships here. It's constant fun. When it's time to lock in, we lock in."
That's what James wants.
"That's great to hear from him," they said. "Hopefully, we continue that throughout the locker room. We're trying to build something here. We're trying to build a winning franchise, a winning attitude in the locker room every day, and we want to build it from the ground up and everyone feels like they're a part of something special."
Former West Virginia University running back Noel Devine has signed with the Philadelphia Eagles as an undrafted free agent, according to a report on Tuesday evening.
Devine posted huge numbers in their first three years with the Moutaineers, averaging over six yards per carry in each and racking up 1,289 yards rushing as a sophomore and 1,465 as a junior. They struggled a bit as a senior, however, and was slowed by a toe injury, posting just 936 yards for the year.
He's had a tough life - their parents both died of AIDS, and various adults (including, briefly, Deion Sanders, who went to the same high school as Devine) watched over them after that. As a teenager, they saw a friend of theirs be shot and killed. Despite the struggles, Devine found success on the field and in college at West Virginia.
He's very small, listed at 5-foot-8, 180 pounds (and they might be even smaller than that). But they have excellent speed, and they might be capable of helping the Eagles on returns and on third downs. At their size, they aren't likely to be a featured back, but it's not often that one expects to find that sort of player as an undrafted free agent anyway. At the time of the NFL Draft, Devine looked likely to be a late-round pick, so the Eagles have done well to grab them as a free agent.

Alan Greenspan continues their White-collar $100,000 speaking fee comedy tour in which they tell the audience that they had nothing to do with the housing bubble. Those expecting to see a mea culpa concert from the former Fed Chairman are going to be waiting for a very long time. According to the majestic maestro, a low interest rate environment has nothing to do with encouraging people to borrow. This line of thinking from the U.S. Treasury and Federal Reserve is precisely the reason we created an ecology that was conducive to planting and growing excessive debt.
You would think that we have learned a lesson about excessive liquidity but the current Federal Reserve has gone even below the 1% Fed funds rate and is now hugging the zero bound range forcing the Fed to do the modern dance of quantitative easing. What is quantitative easing? When the central bank reaches the zero bound like in our current economy causing monetary easing an impotent pursuit, the central bank then begins to purchase items such as treasuries and corporate bonds from banks and other financial institutions with money it has created ex nihilo. That is, out of thin air. Quantitative easing isn't “printing money” but the central bank does create additional credit by merely increasing their balance sheet. It is the electronic version of printing dough for banks.
Now to blame the entire housing bubble on Greenspan is not entirely correct. However, what they did do was create an environment, with the blessing of the Federal Reserve and U.S. Treasury to create the biggest debt bubble in history. Let us take a look at how year over year debt matched up with the drops in the Fed funds rate:
There is nothing more telling than the above chart. The year over year change in household debt moves in near perfect synchronization with each subsequent cut in the interest rate. Each cut increased debt exponentially. The market in 2004 was telling us to cool our jets with debt:
In 2004 household debt hit a year over year peak. It simply could not go anymore. The market was screaming “hike up the rate Greenie! I have green shoot smoke coming out of my nostrils!” At this point, anyone and everyone with a pulse had access to enough funds to buy any home of their choosing. We hit the comical apex of the debt bubble. The 30 year housing bubble reached a hilarious climax where no job, no income, and horrible credit meant that you were a perfect candidate for an adjustable rate mortgage with a 1.25% teaser rate (thanks Greenspan!). And of course Greenspan warned us about those toxic mortgages in 2004 that even in 2009, still linger on the balance sheets of banks like a crazy ex-girlfriend. Or did he?
“(February 2004 – USAToday) Overall, the household sector seems to be in good shape,” Greenspan said.
Americans have been buying homes and refinancing mortgages at a record pace in the past several years, lured by low interest rates. Most mortgages are fixed rate, so consumers can prepay when rates go down but do not face higher costs if rates rise. Under adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs), which made up about 28% of mortgages in January, borrowers usually have lower initial rates but face the risk of higher payments if rates in the broader economy rise.
While borrowers can refinance fixed-rate mortgages, Greenspan said homeowners were paying as much as 0.5 to 1.2 percentage points for that right and the protection against a potential rate rise, which could increase annual after-tax payments by several thousand dollars.
They said a Fed study suggested many homeowners could have saved tens of thousands of dollars in the last decade if they had ARMs. Those savings would not have been realized, however, had interest rates shot up. ”
“American consumers might benefit if lenders provided greater mortgage product alternatives to the traditional fixed-rate mortgage,” Greenspan said.”
That Greenspan. Didn't I tell you they were on a White-collar comedy tour? In that first chart that I included above, I also put in the historical trend of 30-year fixed mortgages. You know, the traditional tried and tested kind once used in mortgage burning parties? As you can see, rates did decrease but nothing to the absurdity of the adjustable rate mortgage market. We now know how painfully stupid that move was. In fact, Greenspan also commented how great mortgage equity withdrawals had become to the vitality of our economy. This guy isn't the main reason for the current economic mess but they were the captain of the varsity debt bubble cheerleading club.
During this debt induced decade we have also redefined a few terms in our language:
Debt has now become credit
Usage: We are currently suffering a credit crisis.
Junk bonds are now known as high yield bonds
Usage: These high yield bonds sure screwed up my 401k!
Casino has now become the derivatives market
Usage: I was going to gamble at the MGM but decided to buy some AIG derivatives!
Toxic mortgages are now known as legacy assets
Usage: I hate toxic mortgages but man, I can't get enough of these legacy assets!
Creating money out of nothing is now quantitative easing
Usage: I despise creating money out of nothing but I sure love them quantitative easing!
Now this is important because it has softened the negativity of what these words really signify. What we are suffering through is the bursting of a debt bubble. We have a market full of junk securities. The market is full of toxic mortgages. Yet you wouldn't know that from the headline numbers. In fact we have 24,700,000 unemployed or underemployed Americans yet in the headline number, we only hear about the 13 million unemployed. Apparently working 10 hours a week at Wal-Mart for minimum wage is considered fully employed. This would be a prime candidate for Greenspan's wonderful adjustable rate mortgage product of yesteryear. Income stagnant or dropping? Go into debt!
Greenspan is the epic debt creator and is so good at filling a room with nonsense that they can fool people into paying them $100,000 for yapping about their legendary monetary failures. Like the Wizard of Oz, except in their tool box they have monetary easing and interest rates and their road is paved with quantitative easing. Time to finance those ruby red slippers.

Planetary Resources, the aerospace company launched by X PRIZE Foundation creator Peter H. Diamandis, wants to raise a million dollars from private citizens to build, launch and operate a publicly accessible space telescope.
The company, which is best known for its plans to develop and deploy technology for asteroid mining, launched a Kickstarter campaign called "ARKYD: A Space Telescope for Everyone" on Wednesday afternoon. The fundraiser seeks donations towards a $1,000,000 goal, with a deadline of June 30th; if that goal is reached, Planetary Resources will use the proceeds to launch the telescope, fund the creation of a public interface, and fund an educational curriculum for students.
“When we launched Planetary Resources last year, we had an extraordinary response from the general public. Tens of thousands of people contacted us and wanted to be involved," Peter Diamandis said in a statement. "In the last 50 years, space exploration has been led by national governmental agencies with their own set of priorities; and now we're changing the nature of exploration. We're developing the most advanced space technology ever made available to the public.”
Contributors to the Kickstarter campaign can receive a variety of rewards based on their pledge level, including "Your Face in Space" for $25, where the team will upload an image of the campaign backer's choice to display on the ARKYD, snap a photo of it with the Earth in the background, and transmit it back to the backer.
The campaign runs for 33 days and ends on June 30, 2013; if Planetary Resources is unable to raise the million dollars, all pledges will be returned.

We introduced DataFrames in Apache Spark 1.3 to make Apache Spark much easier to use. Inspired by data frames in R and Python, DataFrames in Spark expose an API that's similar to the single-node data tools that data scientists are already familiar with. Statistics is an important part of everyday data science. We are happy to announce improved support for statistical and mathematical functions in the upcoming 1.4 release.
In this blog post, we walk through some of the important functions, including:
Random data generation Summary and descriptive statistics Sample covariance and correlation Cross tabulation (a.k.a. contingency table) Frequent items Mathematical functions
We use Python in our examples. However, similar APIs exist for Scala and Java users as well.
1. Random Data Generation
Random data generation is useful for testing of existing algorithms and implementing randomized algorithms, such as random projection. We provide methods under sql.functions for generating columns that contains i.i.d. values drawn from a distribution, e.g., uniform ( rand ), and standard normal ( randn ).
In [1]: from pyspark.sql.functions import rand, randn In [2]: # Create a DataFrame with one int column and 10 rows. In [3]: df = sqlContext.range(0, 10) In [4]: df.show() +--+ |id| +--+ | 0| | 1| | 2| | 3| | 4| | 5| | 6| | 7| | 8| | 9| +--+ In [4]: # Generate two other columns using uniform distribution and normal distribution. In [5]: df.select("id", rand(seed=10).alias("uniform"), randn(seed=27).alias("normal")).show() +--+-------------------+--------------------+ |id| uniform| normal| +--+-------------------+--------------------+ | 0| 0.7224977951905031| -0.1875348803463305| | 1| 0.2953174992603351|-0.26525647952450265| | 2| 0.4536856090041318| -0.7195024130068081| | 3| 0.9970412477032209| 0.5181478766595276| | 4|0.19657711634539565| 0.7316273979766378| | 5|0.48533720635534006| 0.07724879367590629| | 6| 0.7369825278894753| -0.5462256961278941| | 7| 0.5241113627472694| -0.2542275002421211| | 8| 0.2977697066654349| -0.5752237580095868| | 9| 0.5060159582230856| 1.0900096472044518| +--+-------------------+--------------------+
2. Summary and Descriptive Statistics
The first operation to perform after importing data is to get some sense of what it looks like. For numerical columns, knowing the descriptive summary statistics can help a lot in understanding the distribution of your data. The function describe returns a DataFrame containing information such as number of non-null entries (count), mean, standard deviation, and minimum and maximum value for each numerical column.
In [1]: from pyspark.sql.functions import rand, randn In [2]: # A slightly different way to generate the two random columns In [3]: df = sqlContext.range(0, 10).withColumn('uniform', rand(seed=10)).withColumn('normal', randn(seed=27)) In [4]: df.describe().show() +-------+------------------+-------------------+--------------------+ |summary| id| uniform| normal| +-------+------------------+-------------------+--------------------+ | count| 10| 10| 10| | mean| 4.5| 0.5215336029384192|-0.01309370117407197| | stddev|2.8722813232690143| 0.229328162820653| 0.5756058014772729| | min| 0|0.19657711634539565| -0.7195024130068081| | max| 9| 0.9970412477032209| 1.0900096472044518| +-------+------------------+-------------------+--------------------+
If you have a DataFrame with a large number of columns, you can also run describe on a subset of the columns:
In [4]: df.describe('uniform', 'normal').show() +-------+-------------------+--------------------+ |summary| uniform| normal| +-------+-------------------+--------------------+ | count| 10| 10| | mean| 0.5215336029384192|-0.01309370117407197| | stddev| 0.229328162820653| 0.5756058014772729| | min|0.19657711634539565| -0.7195024130068081| | max| 0.9970412477032209| 1.0900096472044518| +-------+-------------------+--------------------+
Of course, while describe works well for quick exploratory data analysis, you can also control the list of descriptive statistics and the columns they apply to using the normal select on a DataFrame:
In [5]: from pyspark.sql.functions import mean, min, max In [6]: df.select([mean('uniform'), min('uniform'), max('uniform')]).show() +------------------+-------------------+------------------+ | AVG(uniform)| MIN(uniform)| MAX(uniform)| +------------------+-------------------+------------------+ |0.5215336029384192|0.19657711634539565|0.9970412477032209| +------------------+-------------------+------------------+
3. Sample covariance and correlation
Covariance is a measure of how two variables change with respect to each other. A positive number would mean that there is a tendency that as one variable increases, the other increases as well. A negative number would mean that as one variable increases, the other variable has a tendency to decrease. The sample covariance of two columns of a DataFrame can be calculated as follows:
In [1]: from pyspark.sql.functions import rand In [2]: df = sqlContext.range(0, 10).withColumn('rand1', rand(seed=10)).withColumn('rand2', rand(seed=27)) In [3]: df.stat.cov('rand1', 'rand2') Out[3]: 0.009908130446217347 In [4]: df.stat.cov('id', 'id') Out[4]: 9.166666666666666
As you can see from the above, the covariance of the two randomly generated columns is close to zero, while the covariance of the id column with itself is very high.
The covariance value of 9.17 might be hard to interpret. Correlation is a normalized measure of covariance that is easier to understand, as it provides quantitative measurements of the statistical dependence between two random variables.
In [5]: df.stat.corr('rand1', 'rand2') Out[5]: 0.14938694513735398 In [6]: df.stat.corr('id', 'id') Out[6]: 1.0
In the above example, id correlates perfectly with itself, while the two randomly generated columns have low correlation value.
4. Cross Tabulation (Contingency Table)
Cross Tabulation provides a table of the frequency distribution for a set of variables. Cross-tabulation is a powerful tool in statistics that is used to observe the statistical significance (or independence) of variables. In Spark 1.4, users will be able to cross-tabulate two columns of a DataFrame in order to obtain the counts of the different pairs that are observed in those columns. Here is an example on how to use crosstab to obtain the contingency table.
In [1]: # Create a DataFrame with two columns (name, item) In [2]: names = ["Alice", "Bob", "Mike"] In [3]: items = ["milk", "bread", "butter", "apples", "oranges"] In [4]: df = sqlContext.createDataFrame([(names[i % 3], items[i % 5]) for i in range(100)], ["name", "item"]) In [5]: # Take a look at the first 10 rows. In [6]: df.show(10) +-----+-------+ | name| item| +-----+-------+ |Alice| milk| | Bob| bread| | Mike| butter| |Alice| apples| | Bob|oranges| | Mike| milk| |Alice| bread| | Bob| butter| | Mike| apples| |Alice|oranges| +-----+-------+ In [7]: df.stat.crosstab("name", "item").show() +---------+----+-----+------+------+-------+ |name_item|milk|bread|apples|butter|oranges| +---------+----+-----+------+------+-------+ | Bob| 6| 7| 7| 6| 7| | Mike| 7| 6| 7| 7| 6| | Alice| 7| 7| 6| 7| 7| +---------+----+-----+------+------+-------+
One important thing to keep in mind is that the cardinality of columns we run crosstab on cannot be too big. That is to say, the number of distinct “name” and “item” cannot be too large. Just imagine if “item” contains 1 billion distinct entries: how would you fit that table on your screen?!
5. Frequent Items
Figuring out which items are frequent in each column can be very useful to understand a dataset. In Spark 1.4, users will be able to find the frequent items for a set of columns using DataFrames. We have implemented an one-pass algorithm proposed by Karp et al. This is a fast, approximate algorithm that always return all the frequent items that appear in a user-specified minimum proportion of rows. Note that the result might contain false positives, i.e. items that are not frequent.
In [1]: df = sqlContext.createDataFrame([(1, 2, 3) if i % 2 == 0 else (i, 2 * i, i % 4) for i in range(100)], ["a", "b", "c"]) In [2]: df.show(10) +-+--+-+ |a| b|c| +-+--+-+ |1| 2|3| |1| 2|1| |1| 2|3| |3| 6|3| |1| 2|3| |5|10|1| |1| 2|3| |7|14|3| |1| 2|3| |9|18|1| +-+--+-+ In [3]: freq = df.stat.freqItems(["a", "b", "c"], 0.4)
Given the above DataFrame, the following code finds the frequent items that show up 40% of the time for each column:
In [4]: freq.collect()[0] Out[4]: Row(a_freqItems=[11, 1], b_freqItems=[2, 22], c_freqItems=[1, 3])
As you can see, “11” and “1” are the frequent values for column “a”. You can also find frequent items for column combinations, by creating a composite column using the struct function:
In [5]: from pyspark.sql.functions import struct In [6]: freq = df.withColumn('ab', struct('a', 'b')).stat.freqItems(['ab'], 0.4) In [7]: freq.collect()[0] Out[7]: Row(ab_freqItems=[Row(a=11, b=22), Row(a=1, b=2)])
From the above example, the combination of “a=11 and b=22”, and “a=1 and b=2” appear frequently in this dataset. Note that “a=11 and b=22” is a false positive.
6. Mathematical Functions
Spark 1.4 also added a suite of mathematical functions. Users can apply these to their columns with ease. The list of math functions that are supported come from this file (we will also post pre-built documentation once 1.4 is released).

Warren on Friday reportedly lifted their hold and will allow the Senate to vote on Makan Delrahim's confirmation. Delrahim was nominated by Trump in March.

NAGARIGI BEACH, JAPAN –
A terrible roar came from the depths of a little-explored section of the Sea of Japan this morning, as Waffle Monster emerged from their cocoon of volcanic rock, and rose from the sea to do battle with your plan to lose 15 pounds this winter.
Long Been Dormant
Many years have passed since Waffle Monster first appeared. They vanquished your plan to get in shape for your wedding, back when you were in your twenties. And then, just as mysteriously as they appeared, they turned and walked back into the ocean having accomplished their mission.
A great volcano erupted underwater and covered them with lava, leading you to believe they would never be heard from again.
Terrible Destruction Of Your Goals
And now, they have returned. Although you will mount a strident defense, Waffle Monster will overcome all attempts to defeat him. There is no weapon known to humans that can stop Waffle Monster as they crush your goal to be slimmer. Waffle Monster is invincible. Nothing can deter him.
Your Only Hope
The only hope you have to stop Waffle Monster is Treadmillidon. If Treadmillidon were to appear, they could slow down Waffle Monster. But Treadmillidon has not been seen for many years, and is covered by several inches of dust in your basement.
No, Treadmillidon will not arrive to defeat Waffle Monster.
Victorious Again
Waffle Monster will triumph. They will destroy your hope for losing 15 pounds. And when they are done, they will let out their terrible roar. And once again, walk back into the sea from whence they came.
Enigmatic, alone, and delicious.

London, England (CNN) -- They were 51 young men who met a grisly death far from home, their heads chopped off and their bodies thrown into a mass grave.
Their resting place was unknown until last year, when workers excavating for a road near the London 2012 Olympic sailing venue in Weymouth, England, unearthed the grave. But questions remained about whom the men were, how long they had been there and why they had been decapitated.
On Friday, officials revealed that analysis of the men's teeth shows they were Vikings, executed with sharp blows to the head around a thousand years ago. They were killed during the Dark Ages, when Vikings frequently invaded the region.
"To find out that the young men executed were Vikings is a thrilling development," said David Score, project manager for Oxford Archaeology, which excavated the remains. "Any mass grave is a relatively rare find, but to find one on this scale, from this period of history, is extremely unusual and presents an incredible opportunity to learn more about what is happening in Dorset at this time."
Radiocarbon dating had already placed the remains between A.D. 890 and 1030, before the Norman conquest of Anglo-Saxon England.
Scientists from the British Geological Survey then went further and analyzed the men's teeth to find out exactly where they were from. Isotope analysis of teeth can reveal clues about a person's drinking water, and in turn the climate they came from, said Jane Evans, an isotope geochemist at the survey.
"What we found was all of these guys came from a climate that had to be colder than Britain ... probably Sweden and Norway," Evans said by phone Friday. "One guy had such a signature of such a cold climate that they probably came from above the Arctic Circle."
The isotopes also show the men had eaten a high-protein diet, comparable to known sites in Sweden. It means the men were probably Scandinavian Vikings who were executed by Anglo-Saxons.
Evans and their colleagues at the British Geological Survey's NERC Isotope Geosciences Laboratory in Nottingham, England, analyzed 10 of the skeletons over the course of six weeks.
"These results are fantastic," Evans said. "This is the best example we have ever seen of a group of individuals that clearly have their origins outside Britain."
Many of the executed men suffered multiple wounds, inflicted by a sharp-bladed weapon, to the skull, jaw and upper spine, all thought to relate to the process of decapitation, the Dorset County Council said.
Some men show evidence of other wounds, including a cut to the pelvis, blows to the chest and stomach, and defensive injuries to the hands, the council said.
The bones still appear cleanly sliced, indicating the men suffered a "sword-based execution," Evans said.
There are also two examples of healed fractures that are unlikely to have been medically treated. In one case, the skeleton's right leg is 5 centimeters, or about 2 inches, shorter than the left, which would have given the person a pronounced limp, the council said.
The burial site was found during work for the Weymouth Relief Road, meant to ease traffic congestion on the highway to Weymouth, on England's southern coast. Weymouth Bay and nearby Portland Harbor will host the Olympic and Paralympic sailing events during the 2012 London Olympics.
The leader of the Dorset County Council, Angus Campbell, said the construction of the road had already revealed prehistoric and Iron Age finds.
"But we never would have dreamed of finding a Viking war grave," Campbell said in a statement. "The burial pit took us all by surprise and its story gets more fascinating as the analysis goes on."
Researchers are hoping to find further evidence about the men's lifestyles, activity, health and diet, the council said.
With the iconic Ashes series already decided, cricket fans must be biting their nails. With underdog England's commanding victory over the mighty Australians in the Fourth Ashes Test, there exists a minimal interest in the last Ashes test at The Oval as it is now considered a dead rubber. It seems that the most prestigious test cricket series has lost its charm – at least for the moment.
Sri Lanka vs. India: The Clash of Asian Giants
Well, well, well… here we have some more enthralling excitement for our cricket lovers. The long-standing rivalry between India – the team with one of the most established batting orders in the world and Sri Lanka – the team that is famous for its overall competitiveness has ignited the passion for cricket enthusiasts once again.
The young Sri Lankan Tigers are eager to prey on a new look Indian Lions. This is going to be a memorable and an emotional test series for the huge cricket loving community.
The 3-Test Match series is going to continue from August 12 through September 01 2015. The first test match of the series is still in progress at Galle International Stadium. The 2nd Test will be played at P.Sara Oval in Colombo from August 20 – August 24 2015. The 3rd Test will commence at Sinhalese Sports Club Ground in Colombo, from August 28 – September 01 2015.
Meanwhile, Sri Lanka are looking eager to improve on their home record in the post Muralitharan-Jayawardena- era. India are still in quest of a series victory in Sri Lanka. It has been a long wait of 22 years for them, since they last tasted victory in Colombo in 1993 under Azharuddin's captaincy.
Both the teams are being led by young, energetic, and the most promising leaders. Virat Kohli is leading India for the first time in a full series, while Angelo Mathews is leading a relatively young Sri Lankan unit. India will rely on their strong batting line up, while Sri Lanka is ready to test the patience of Indian batting stalwarts with their spin bowling options. The tracks prepared are surely going to offer turn and bounce to the spinners. It's going to be the true test for batsmen's temperament.
Let's see how Indian batting line up comprising of Shikhar Dhawan, Virat Kohli, Rohit Sharma, and Ajinkya Rahane will face up to the challenge of Sri Lankan batting legend Kumar Sangakkara and spin wizard, Rangana Herath.
Remember, Kumar Sangakkara – one of the most celebrated cricketers of their generation – is playing their last test series. They will retire after the second test match in Colombo. During their illustrious career, spanning 15 years, they have won accolades for their ability to accumulate runs while staying at the crease for longer periods of time. They have tasted success in all forms of the game. They currently have 12,305 runs from 132 test matches, with the highest score of 319 against Bangladesh.  They are currently leading the list of cricketers with the most runs in test cricket and sits fifth in overall rankings for test batsmen with the most career runs.

With no obvious heir apparent as the Republican's 2016 presidential pick, GOP voters are unsure which of the potential 16 candidates they like, choosing “Other/Not Sure” ahead of Mitt Romney, Jeb Bush and Sen. Rand Paul in a new poll released Christmas Day.
In the new Zogby Analytics poll, “Other” won with 19 percent, followed by Romney at 14 percent, Bush at 12 percent and Paul at 10 percent.
Among self-identifying Republicans, Mitt took first. Among self-identified conservatives, Bush was first, a surprise considering the number of hard-line right-wingers lining up to oppose their candidacy.
Pollster John Zogby, who writes Secrets' weekly report card on President Obama, said that on the Democratic side Hillary Rodham Clinton is the top choice and wipes out the GOP field.
“Clinton leads all of the Republican top tier candidates handsomely — 49 percent-34 percent against Bush; 51 percent-33 percent against Paul; 48 percent-33 percent against Christie; and 50 percent to 35 percent against Romney,” they said in a statement about the new poll.
“If the election were held today the next president is a ‘she,' ” said Zogby.
The poll was of 231 likely Republican voters with a margin of sampling error of +/-6.6 percentage points.
From their statement to Secrets:
In a potentially huge field of candidates vying for the Republican nomination for President in 2016, the winner today is Other/Not Sure with 19%. In a new poll of 231 likely Republican primary voters nationwide by Zogby Analytics, 2012 GOP nominee Romney leads the pack with 14%, followed by former Florida Governor Jeb Bush (12%), Kentucky Senator Rand Paul (10%), New Jersey Governor Chris Christie (8%), former Arkansas Governor and now Fox News Host Mike Huckabee (7%), Florida Senator Marco Rubio (7%), Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker (5%), Rep. and former Vice Presidential nominee Paul Ryan (4%), Texas Governor Rick Perry (4%), Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal (3%), Texas Senator Ted Cruz (3%), South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley (2%), former Pennsylvania Senator Rick Santorum (1%), and both Ohio Senator Rob Portman and New Mexico Governor Susana Martinez tied at .3%.
Historically, since 1960 - (with the exception of 1964), the GOP tends to nominate the Gold Watch Candidate, i.e. the fellow who has been around the park the longest and is next in line. At the same time, historically, since 1968, the party has nominated the most "moderate" candidate in the field - with the exception of 1980 when the Gold Watch Candidate Ronald Reagan won over several more moderate candidates who split among themselves. This poll shows that the top four candidates do not fall within the strictest definition of "conservative" as defined by both the social and Christian conservative wings of the party. These more moderate split 44% of the total.
Federal unions are doubling down on their campaigns to defeat the Conservatives in key area ridings — including that of Conservative powerhouse and regional minister Pierre Poilievre — as a “momentum for change” builds in the final stretch of the federal election.
Debi Daviau, president of the Professional Institute of the Public Service of Canada, said the union will pull all the stops over the next few days to mobilize public servants to vote and replace the Conservative government.
“We are confident that if we can get the vote out, there will be change,” said Daviau. “The more members we get out, the better the chance of changing the government.”
Until now PIPSC, which represents professionals from scientists and auditors to engineers and technology experts, targeted four Ottawa-area ridings where it has a total concentration of more than 10,000 members — 3,260 in Nepean, 2,290 in Ottawa-Orleans, 2,130 in Ottawa West-Nepean, and 1,750 in Carleton.

Poilievre is expected to win the new riding of Carleton — which was hived from the former riding of Nepean-Carleton.
Daviau said the union included it as a target riding for “symbolic” reasons because of Poilievre's prominence as regional minister for the National Capital Region. They said what's changed is a shifting momentum away from the Conservatives that opened an “opportunity for change,” they said.
They said Poilievre has made missteps, such as mounting a poor defence on the muzzling of scientists and killing the long-form census. Prime Minister Stephen Harper's open letter to the public service – delivered by Poilievre – and their proposed ban on the niqab in the public service have not gone over well with many public servants.
“What's different now is that we are actually going to try and take them out,” said Daviau.
Poilievre said in an email that union leaders are misleading public servants about Conservative policies and they are sure public servants will vote for low taxes and balanced budgets.
“We have eliminated the deficit without the mass layoffs the Liberals introduced in the 1990s. We have protected defined-benefits plans and will continue to do so without any changes whatsoever,” they said.
“In the end, public servants will vote to keep taxes low and the budget balanced. The alternative under the Liberals is higher taxes and more debt to fund out-of-control spending.”
Both PIPSC and the giant Public Service Alliance of Canada are ramping up their efforts in ridings with tight two-way races to stop vote-splitting that could result in Conservative wins. They aren't telling members how to vote but they are calling and door-knocking for the rest of the week to make members vote for the party in their ridings most likely to unseat the Conservatives.
PIPSC is expanding its efforts to Kanata-Carleton, where the public service vote could make a difference in what's shaping up to be a close Liberal-Conservative race.
“We didn't select Kanata-Carleton at first because we didn't think there was a chance … of unseating the Conservatives, and now that there is a tie in the polls and a red wave is happening, we thought, ‘Let's give it a whirl',” said Daviau.
PSAC Vice-President Larry Rousseau said the union is targeting Kanata-Carleton, as well as the ridings of Glengarry-Prescott-Russell, Nepean and Pontiac.
Rousseau said the vote turnout among public servants is historically low in the National Capital Region, where many opt to remain neutral and not vote at all. PSAC has about 50,000 members in the region.
They said a high turnout of public servants, disillusioned by a decade of Tory cuts and a deteriorating relationship with the government, could turn electoral fortunes in the tight races shaping up in some area ridings.
“I can tell you they are engaged this time and will be coming out to vote,” they said.
Both the Liberals and NDP announced public service platforms aimed at rebuilding the relationship and restoring trust.
Along with door-knocking, the unions will be stepping up their campaigns with telephone blitzes and mobilizing employees at work. Union representatives will be reminding public servants to vote as they arrive and leave work. Daviau said the unions have rented commercial space in some office buildings to distribute pamphlets and remind people to vote.
PSAC set aside $5 million for the election campaign and spent about $2.7 million on its Vote to Stop the Cuts campaign before the election. It has earmarked another $430,000 to carry the campaign to voting day.
It tailored its advertising strategy around the pre- and post-writ periods because the Fair Elections Act imposed strict limits on third-party advertising during election campaigns.
Daviau said PIPSC has spent about half of its spending limit since the writ was dropped.
Kim Jong-un is shaking up their style, and we think we know who inspired their new hairdo.
The supreme leader of North Korea became the talk of the Internet when they displayed a fuller, flatter and taller hairstyle during a politburo meeting in Pyongyang on Wednesday.
Like most things involving the dictator, the circumstances surrounding the bold new look remain a mystery, but we couldn't help but notice that it looks oddly similar to the “flat top” haircut that was popularized in the '90s by stars like Will Smith and Kid from Kid ‘n Play.
We know that '90s kid Kim has a certain love for that particular decade – after all, they turned their appreciation for former NBA player (and '90s icon) Dennis Rodman into an ever-blossoming friendship – but their new-look might be taking the trend a bit too far.
However, in a country where leaders often use their public image to send strong messages, some DPRK watchers are wondering if this is another attempt by the young leader to mimic the style of their wildly popular father, Kim Jong-il, and grandfather, Kim Il-sung, both of whom rocked similar looks.
Either way, we have to say – Smith wore it better.
Here's what you need to know about Rep. Paul Ryan (R-Wis.), the former vice presidential nominee who is running for House speaker. (Gillian Brockell/The Washington Post)
Rep. Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) will soon be speaker of the House, officially announcing their candidacy for the job on Thursday night after securing the support they need to be elected — including from most members of the antagonistic, conservative Freedom Caucus.
And there are smiles all around, as even many members of that group express happiness that Ryan has taken the plunge.
However strong this new union might be, it will be tested almost immediately. That's because the House faces a series of fast-approaching deadlines — most notably having to extend the debt ceiling in early November and having to avert another government shutdown in early December.
Previous versions of these debates have suggested the only way Democrats will agree (or need to, politically speaking) to a debt limit increase or funding the government is if those things are clean and don't include add-ons or changes that conservatives want. Will Ryan try and gain concessions that the Freedom Caucus approves of, or will they go a more moderate route?
Ryan's election as speaker is likely to take place on Wednesday — just one day before the National Highway Trust Fund runs out of money. It will be the first of many trying moments in their first few weeks.
Here's a look at the many deadlines of what would otherwise be Ryan's honeymoon:

With the La Raza twins scheduled to speak at the National Council of La Raza this Saturday, I devoted my syndicated column today to telling the truth about “The Race.” I've blogged these points before, but they are worth repeating as McCain, Obama, and the press whitewash “The Race's” open-borders radicalism.
Stefan Sharkansky at Sound Politics reports that a new La Raza/The Race preschool has opened up in Seattle–subsidized with tax dollars. Meanwhile, San Diego has gone ahead and passed its mayoral-backed resolution declaring La Raza/The Race Day. Here's video. Those who protested the decision were slammed as…racists.

15 things you should know about “The Race”
by Michelle Malkin
Creators Syndicate
Copyright 2008
Only in America could critics of a group called “The Race” be labeled racists. Such is the triumph of left-wing identity chauvinists, whose aggressive activists and supine abettors have succeeded in redefining all opposition as “hate.”
Both Barack Obama and John McCain will speak this week in San Diego at the annual conference of the National Council of La Raza, the Latino organization whose name is Spanish for, yes, “The Race.” Can you imagine Obama and McCain paying homage to a group of white people that called themselves that? No matter. The presidential candidates and the media have legitimized “The Race” as a mainstream ethnic lobbying group and marginalized “The Race's” critics as intolerant bigots. The unvarnished truth is that the group is a radical ethnic nationalist outfit that abuses your tax dollars and milks p.c. politics to undermine our sovereignty.
Here are 15 things you should know about “The Race:”
15. “The Race” supports driver's licenses for illegal aliens.
14.”The Race” demands in-state tuition discounts for illegal alien students that are not available to law-abiding US citizens and law-abiding legal immigrants.
13. “The Race” vehemently opposes cooperative immigration enforcement efforts between local, state, and federal authorities.
12. “The Race” opposes a secure fence on the southern border.
11. “The Race” joined the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee in a failed lawsuit attempt to prevent the feds from entering immigration information into a key national crime database–and to prevent local police officers from accessing the data.
10. “The Race” opposed the state of Oklahoma's tough immigration enforcement-first laws, which cut off welfare to illegal aliens, put teeth in employer sanctions, and strengthened local-federal cooperation and information-sharing.
9. “The Race” joined other open-borders, anti-assimilationists and sued to prevent Proposition 227, California's bilingual education reform ballot initiative, from becoming law.
8. “The Race” bitterly protested common-sense voter ID provisions as an “absolute disgrace.”
7. “The Race” has consistently opposed post-9/11 national security measures at every turn.
6. Former “Race” president Raul Yzaguirre, Hillary Clinton's Hispanic outreach advisor said this: “US English is to Hispanics as the Ku Klux Klan is to blacks.” They were referring to US English the nation's oldest, largest citizens' action group dedicated to preserving the unifying role of the English language in the United States. “The Race” also pioneered Orwellian open-borders Newspeak and advised the Mexican government on how to lobby for illegal alien amnesty while avoiding the terms “illegal” and “amnesty.”
5. “The Race” gives mainstream cover to a poisonous subset of ideological satellites, led by Movimiento Estudiantil Chicano de Aztlan, or Chicano Student Movement of Aztlan (MEChA), which the late GOP Rep. Charlie Norwood rightly characterized as “a radical racist group…[and] one of the most anti-American groups in the country, which has permeated U.S. campuses since the 1960s, and continues its push to carve a racist nation out of the American West.”
4. “The Race” is currently leading a smear campaign against staunch immigration enforcement leaders and has called for TV and cable news netowrks to keep immigration enforcement proponents off the airwaves–in addition to pushing for Fairness Doctrine policies to shut up their foes. The New York Times reported that current “Race” president Janet Murguia believes “hate speech” should “not be tolerated, even if such censorship were a violation of First Amendment rights.”
3. “The Race” sponsors militant ethnic nationalist charter schools subsidized by your public tax dollars (at least $8 million in federal education grants). The schools include “Aztlan Academy” in Tucson, AZ, the Mexicayotl Academy in Nogales, AZ, Academia Cesar Chavez Charter School in St. Paul, Minn., and Academia Semillas del Pueblo in Los Angeles, whose principal inveighed: “We don't want to drink from a White water fountain, we have our own wells and our natural reservoirs and our way of collecting rain in our aqueducts. We don't need a White water fountain…ultimately the White way, the American way, the neo liberal, capitalist way of life will eventually lead to our own destruction.”
2. “The Race” has perfected the art of the p.c. shakedown at taxpayer expense, pushing relentlessly to lower home loan standards for Hispanic borrowers, reaping millions in federal “mortgage counseling” grants, seeking special earmarks, and partnering with banks that do business with illegal aliens.
1. “The Race” thrives on ethnic supremacy–and the elite sheeple's unwillingness to call it what it is. As historian Victor Davis Hanson observes: “[The] organization's very nomenclature ‘The National Council of La Raza' is hate speech to the core. Despite all the contortions of the group, Raza (as its Latin cognate suggests), reflects the meaning of ‘race”‘ in Spanish, not ‘the people' — and that's precisely why we don't hear of something like ‘The National Council of the People' which would not confer the buzz notion of ethnic, racial, and tribal chauvinism.”
The fringe is the center. The center is the fringe. Viva La Raza.

Once they've been on the air long enough, most television shows start to become a little more reflective, a little more aware of their own histories, a little more apt to try to look back and tie everything together. With the release of Captain America: Civil War around the corner, and the increased viewership Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. is likely to attract because of it, the folks behind the show are more inclined to try to make a statement, pull out all the stops, and demonstrate that their work stands equal with its cinematic brethren. So “Failed Experiments” presents the audience with a referendum on its protagonist, a referendum on S.H.I.E.L.D., and in some ways, a referendum on the series itself.
The episode asks whether S.H.I.E.L.D. is legitimately a force for good or not. Does it help people or just use them? Hive certainly seems to believe it's the latter. They are, like many characters in Whedon shows (or Whedon-lite shows), given great power, but also given no say in the matter, and forced to suffer a great deal of abuse in the process. The flashback to their Inhuman origin story at the hands of the Kree is horrifying, not just because of the hooks tearing into their flesh while stone-faced blue angels look on without concern, but because they are a human being having their autonomy violated, a primitive man who cannot even begin to understand what's happening to him, let alone consent to it. It's understandable that in the present, Hive is naturally suspicious of anyone or anything that turns people into soldiers or living weapons, whether by technology, terrigenesis, or training.
That sentiment gets through to Daisy, despite their initial resistance to it. When they try to explain to Mack that they started as a hacker, that they began as a mechanic, and yet now, somehow, they're both soldiers, and there's something wrong with that, there's a ring of truth to it. They may be parroting the words of the big bad, but looking back at where Daisy and Mack and so many others on the show started, there is something strange, even suspicious, about how each of them ended up here.
In fairness, there's a certain amount of willing suspension of disbelief that's required for a show like AoS, and it helps to answer this question for the audience, if not for the characters in-universe. The demands of a weekly T.V. drama mean that Coulson's team has to constantly go on adventures; they have to get into scrapes and scraps; and they have to fight the bad guys. It also means that the titular agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. cannot spend their lives behind a computer screens, or underneath a car, or filling beakers in a lab somewhere. They have to be out in the field, fighting and getting into trouble and coming this close to losing their lives in the fray. Otherwise, Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. would be a pretty boring series, or at least a very different one. A superhero show–or even a superhero-adjacent show–needs to meet a certain quota of action, and so even the lab techs, gearheads, and technophiles have to face the danger from time-to-time.
But “Failed Experiments” takes a moment to deconstruct that idea, just a little bit. It's hard to know how much of what Daisy is saying is really coming from her, and how much of it is just Hive's brainwashing, but she's not wrong to point out that S.H.I.E.L.D. has made people like them and Mack into something else, into soldiers and warriors and spies and killers, and there's a real question about whether that change is right, let alone for the better.
Mack responds that times changed, and they all had to change with it, and there's truth in that statement as well. In a world where gods war with one another in the streets of New York City and aliens fall from the sky on a semi-annual basis, sitting on the sidelines isn't necessarily the safest or wisest option.
And yet, it also seems like an excuse, like a rationalization for why Mack and Daisy and too many people close to them have had to put their lives on the line, have been put into situations where they had to hurt, maim, and kill other people, without necessarily having the time or the environment or the genuine freedom to truly decide if all of that is what they really wanted. It's something Hive knows all too well.
In the same vein, there's a recurring theme in “Failed Experiments” of people having to decide whether to follow their hearts or follow the mission. And it's coupled with internal struggles over who gets to make that call.
Coulson gives Lincoln a direct order not to test out Simmons's antitoxin on himself, regardless of whether it could be the key to defeating Hive. But Lincoln disobeys them and does it anyway, in the hope that it could help them save Daisy. And when Simmons responds to Fitz's encouraging them by saying that Daisy would never want Lincoln to take that kind of risk just to save her, Fitz tells them that it's a good thing Daisy doesn't get to decide. The subtext is clear. Fitz went off-mission to save the woman they loved. It was a foolish, poorly-thought-out risk for them to take, but Simmons wouldn't be standing there if they hadn't taken it.
By the same token, after S.H.I.E.L.D.'s facial recognition scanners pick up Daisy on the monitors, Coulson and Mack argue over whether it's a sign that they know they're looking for them and she's trying to lure them into a trap, or whether some part of them is asking to be rescued. Coulson is still reeling from the last time they let their emotions get the better of him, when they themselves departed from the mission and from protocol because of their personal feelings. Their anger at Rosalind's death led to them going after Ward and inadvertently led to them bringing Hive back with him. He's been a colder man since then, harsher in their pragmatism, more skeptical in their assessments, and more cognizant of the risks.
And May is all about the mission–always has been–and they too try to keep their emotions out of the equation, even when it's clear that they're bubbling under the surface. She's the kind of person who can and will shoot down the man they love without reservation when they believe he's turned into a murderous monster, even if it pains them to do it.
But Mack isn't as seasoned as Coulson or May. They aren't as hardened, and he's not capable of compartmentalizing their feelings like that. They can't block out the part of them that cares about “Tremors,” that feels like they failed their partner, and thinks that whatever's left of the Daisy they knew is still there somewhere, beneath Hive's persuasion, waiting for a helping hand.
So instead, they lay down their arms and tries to talk Daisy down. They try to show that he's not just a weapon, or a soldier. He's a friend, one who cares too much about Daisy to let this happen to her, no matter how happy they swear it's made them They can't let go. They won't fight them They won't force them They just wants to save them
Daisy, however, is tired of being saved. They begin to recount their history. They point out that when S.H.I.E.L.D. took them in from Rising Tide, Coulson treated them like a daughter, but also like someone who needed to be reined in and rescued, their own personal reclamation project. They always had to have someone looking out for her, someone protecting them from herself. Now, at the very least, they feel like she's in control.
It's a difficult story to accept coming from someone who's under the spell of the villain and part of a collectivist hive mind, but they make an unexpectedly convincing argument that S.H.I.E.L.D. is a hive mind of its own. It's an organization that takes in “misfit toys,” that tells them they're special and a part of something bigger, and then turns them around and sends them off to war for the organization's own ends.
And yet, Hive took Daisy's words to heart as well. When the Kree reapers who turned them into a living weapon return to Earth, seeking to rectify their “mistakes,” one of them calls them a “failed experiment.” They repeat Daisy's words to them — that sometimes the most beautiful things in the world happen by accident. The implication is that even if the Kree intended to use Hive as a tool for death and destruction, as a means to bring blight and horror unto this world and many others, they chose their own path and became something greater than whatever they were intended for. Again, it's hard to hear coming from someone who's been more than a little vindictive over the course of the last few episodes, but there's something sympathetic, even a bit life-affirming about that perspective.
I have little doubt that Daisy will be cured of their Hive-infection by the end of the season, but maybe this accident will stick with them Perhaps she'll continue to look at the person she's become, and think of themselves a little differently than they did before they became connected to Hive. Maybe she'll come to regret certain parts of their past that they took for granted, that she'd accepted, without reflection, as being for the greater good and just part of the mission.
And maybe S.H.I.E.L.D., as it once existed, only served to make more wars for its soldiers to fight. Maybe even Coulson's version of the organization has stirred up as much trouble as it's settled down. But maybe there's also good that can and has come from it, including someone like Daisy, who is no longer lost, who knows who they are and has a better idea of where they fit into the world.
The title of the episode, “Failed Experiments,” can refer to several different things in the shadow of Daisy's maxim. It can refer to Hive, who was designed to be a weapon, and subsequently abused and tortured until they turned into this all-encompassing demigod. But Hive rebelled and now wants to bring the whole world into the fold. Despite the seemingly evil nature of their plot, they mean well by it. They intend it as an attempt to effect harmony and even peace.
It can also be Daisy, who was meant to realize their potential under Coulson and has suffered a lifetime's worth of hardships since they joined their team. But she's also come out on the other end of those hardships a stronger, more confident and capable person.
It can be S.H.I.E.L.D. as a whole, an organization founded to protect the innocent and defend the world, which nevertheless found itself consumed from within by a cancer that tainted every good thing it had tried to do. Then, from those ashes, it was reformed by our heroes and meant to become something different, something better.
And it can be Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. itself, a series that was initially created as a monster-of-the-week affair, intended to tie into the cinematic juggernaut that spawned it, earning little acclaim or success in the process. Yet it emerged from the rubble of that initial idea as a show that has its highs and lows, but which evolved to stand on its own, with enough thematic chutzpah to bring these questions to the fore, even if they emerge in the spaces between fistfights among genetically-engineered villains and extraterrestrial enforcers. These are all accidents, unforeseen elements that weren't part of the plan or the mission, that nevertheless became something worthwhile.
Odds and Ends
- The episode did manage to work in an oblique but still pretty obvious reference to Civil War, even if there weren't the same sort of overt tie-ins to the year's big Marvel film like there have been in prior seasons.
- I've generally liked the way Brett Dalton's played Hive, but here they got a little too Bond villain-y, and dare I say, vaguely Frank Underwood-esque in their demeanor.
- Fitz and Simmons are still adorable, even when they're just busting on Simmons's ex-boyfriend.
- Lincoln's “I'm tired of arguing” line followed by them jamming the needle into their arm was the cheesiest, most predictable moment in the episode. I'm not a fan of the character in general, but the writing's not doing them any favors.
- James continues to be a bright spot with their scruffy if eye-roll-worthy charms. Pairing them with May for a few scenes was a great choice, and their instant pool cue beat down as soon as they got the information they needed was the icing on the cake.
- I appreciate the unique nature of Hive's goals here, though I have to admit it reminds me a great deal of Jasmine from Angel.
Nixon laughed when I told them this. "Don't worry," they said, "I, too, am a family man, and we feel the same way about you."
It was Richard Nixon who got me into politics, and now that he's gone, I feel lonely. They were a giant in their way. As long as Nixon was politically alive -- and they are, all the way to the end -- we could always be sure of finding the enemy on the Low Road. There was no need to look anywhere else for the evil bastard. They had the fighting instincts of a badger trapped by hounds. The badger will roll over on its back and emit a smell of death, which confuses the dogs and lures them in for the traditional ripping and tearing action. But it is usually the badger who does the ripping and tearing. It is a beast that fights best on its back: rolling under the throat of the enemy and seizing it by the head with all four claws.
That was Nixon's style -- and if you forgot, they would kill you as a lesson to the others. Badgers don't fight fair, bubba. That's why God made dachshunds.
Nixon was a navy man, and they should have been buried at sea. Many of their friends were seagoing people: Bebe Rebozo, Robert Vesco, William F. Buckley Jr., and some of them wanted a full naval burial.
These come in at least two styles, however, and Nixon's immediate family strongly opposed both of them. In the traditionalist style, the dead president's body would be wrapped and sewn loosely in canvas sailcloth and dumped off the stern of a frigate at least 100 miles off the coast and at least 1,000 miles south of San Diego, so the corpse could never wash up on American soil in any recognizable form.
The family opted for cremation until they were advised of the potentially onerous implications of a strictly private, unwitnessed burning of the body of the man who was, after all, the President of the United States. Awkward questions might be raised, dark allusions to Hitler and Rasputin. People would be filing lawsuits to get their hands on the dental charts. Long court battles would be inevitable -- some with liberal cranks bitching about corpus delicti and habeas corpus and others with giant insurance companies trying not to pay off on their death benefits. Either way, an orgy of greed and duplicity was sure to follow any public hint that Nixon might have somehow faked their own death or been cryogenically transferred to fascist Chinese interests on the Central Asian Mainland.
It would also play into the hands of those millions of self-stigmatized patriots like me who believe these things already.
If the right people had been in charge of Nixon's funeral, their casket would have been launched into one of those open-sewage canals that empty into the ocean just south of Los Angeles. They were a swine of a man and a jabbering dupe of a president. Nixon was so crooked that they needed servants to help them screw their pants on every morning. Even their funeral was illegal. They were queer in the deepest way. Their body should have been burned in a trash bin.
Well it took a while, but I can now reveal for the first time that O2 and Symantec are blocking an official UK Fathers4Justice website. Previously, Symantec/O2 have only smeared the Fathers4Justice Quebec branch as "hate" and have allowed members in other countries campaign freely to have a relationship with their own children.While the main Fathers4Justice domain isn't blocked at present, a newer campaign site, Contactdeniers.com is categorised as "hate" and thus cannot be accessed by up to 100 million people worldwide. The site in question "is for the naming and shaming of contact deniers - parents, solicitors, judges, Cafcass officers, MP's and any other parties involved in contact denial and the forcible separation of children from their fathers." It's relatively new so far from complete, perhaps readers of this blog can help out by adding an entry or two?Fathers4Justice certainly aren't above criticism, they do occasionally engage in very minor acts of lawbreaking and these type of sites may also run into legal troubles if false information is added. However, none of this is the business of any ISP and it most certainly doesn't constitute hate. The tactics of Father4Justice are very tame compared to countless other activist groups campaigning on different issues, and it's telling that even an openly violent and transphobic radical feminist environmental group such as Deep Green Resistance gets classed as "politics" and is therefore freely accessible to all.There are wider issues to consider here too, Father4Justice use the motto of "The Campaign against the Fatherless Society", and their Name and Shame campaign has the motto that "contact denial is child abuse". If O2 and Symantec block such sites, then are they in favour of the move towards a fatherless society? If they seek to protect contact deniers and even believe exposing such conduct to be "hate" then presumably they support these violations of the human rights of men and children? Rather than blocking these men's human rights organisations, it is surely the duty of ISPs to enable young adults to learn about and access websites of organisations who stand up for their rights. One of the more vocal and successful Fathers4Justice campaigners of late is under 18 herself!In a way I actually welcome this move by these companies. Poking one of the bigger beasts of the men's rights movements with a stick in this way really can't be expected to end well for O2/Symantec. As in all other cases I'll be emailing F4J to let them know all about this and I don't expect they'll be best pleased and if anyone who has contacts at Father4Justice could do the same then it would really be appreciated Perhaps some O2 and Symantec executives will be even found themselves added to the name and shame list…by John Kimble
I just stumbled upon this very short TED talk by Chris Hughes. In their presentation Chris Hughes shows of an “Augmented Reality demo using Adobe Flash!”. In an exited tone they talk about how they wrote a piece of software (!) to allow the replacement of a “2D Barcode” with something “really, really cool” using nothing but Adobe Flash!
In reality they hardly wrote any software, rather did they do a pretty standard and in my opinion a very ugly implementation of Papervision3D and FLARToolkit, for which tutorials can be found online quite easily.
Why is this worth blogging ? Well, as a Papervision3D core developer, personally I'm offended for someone taking credit for both the Papervision3D and the libspark project's FLARToolkit libaries, none of which they have had any hand in. He's essentially taking credit for 100′s of hours of work by both the Papervision3D and the Libspark team. With the TED conference headline being “Ideas worth spreading”, which implies the sharing of knowledge and ideas. Both Papervision3D and FLARToolkit are opensource projects, with exactly that in mind. And both of them get ripped off by Chris Hughes, who not only fails to cite their sources, but takes credit for it by saying the following things on the TED stage :
“……I wrote a piece of software …… “
“Oh, no, it does not quite stop there…….[]……another bit of the technology we managed to introduce here……”
With both statement not only failing to mention the actual technology and projects, Chris Hughes but actually taking credit for it. Disgusting. But hold on, to cite Chris himself, “it does not quite stop there”….in the followup interview on TED.cm Chris Hughes states the following :
“So what you've seen today is a Flash port of an existing project. There's a project out there known as ARToolKit. Unbelievably awesome. It's a university research project. Folks ported it from C, which is what it's written on, onto Java. And then we took the Java port and made it work in Flash.”
That last piece of that sentence is very interesting “we took the java port and made it work in Flash“. Let's make it easy. No you didn't. You took a port named FLARToolkit, and used it in your project. (here are the sources to their demos, which show Papervision3D and FLARToolkit).
So what did Chris Hughes do for them to take credit on a TED Stage ? Most likely, they followed a tutorial like this one from the FlashBlog, then gathered all their courage and energy to work with 2 opensource projects and take credit for it.
One more quote from Chris Hughes here :
“It's open source. Everything I do is about being very open.”
Openness at a conference like TED would be giving urls, credit and a clear explanation of what you did. Right now you're just taking full credit for work done by 2 software team's hundreds (if not thousands of hours) of work, for your own credit.
I hope the TED conference takes the proper steps to avoid people like Chris Hughes standing upon on a stage, presenting other people's work as their own, purely for their own glory. I'm disgusted by this.
[EDIT]
To avoid any confusion, looking back at this hastly and angrily typed post, I want to clarify that most of the work he's demoing which makes this so awesome is the FLARToolkit project. Papervision3D is used for visualization, but I'm guessing most of the awe is for the FLARToolkit project, which is done mainly by saqoosha.
[UPDATE]
The TED conference has removed the video from the Talks page, and is in the process of removing subsequent posts, as a response to the contreversy around Chris their talk. I do feel a rectification of the statement “And then we took the Java port and made it work in Flash.” is still missing, since this is just clearly not true.
I have a lot of feeling towards this kind of presentation of other peoples work without proper accreditation and honestly, I do feel the real victim here is Saqoosha / LibSpark. Saqoosha has posted a blog around this, unfortunately only in japanese.
I'm sorry for the uproar and feeling some people have of this being a witch hunt, or the feeling this was instigating “get your pitchforks and torches out”. That was not the intent of my blogpost. I feel that injustice was done, and it wasn't publicly rectified. As this blogpost was part of the reasoning behind the removal of the video of the TED pages, I do feel it served the proper purpose and in that specific result hit it's goal.
It wasn't my intent to be insulting, or publicly binding Chris Hughes to a stake. Rather this was a way to rectify the injustice which was done to the original developers of the source code they displayed, and took credit for. I apologize for any of my wording which is that strong above and as such removing it would be wrong. Rather then doing that, I'll leave it up and apologize for too strong wording or instigation of a witch hunt. What I won't apologize for is pointing out this issue and subsequently asking attention for it.
[UPDATE2]
I have just been in an enlightning IM discussion with Keith Peters / Bit-101. In this discussion Keith pointed something out I feel I am at fault at. I've could have contacted Chris personally to ask them for a public correction of both their talk and the interview. Instead, I first wrote this post and then mailed Chris later, after any reply from their side stayed out.
I've got no excuse for this and I am at fault for not contacting them directly first. I apologize for that towards Chris Hughes.
[UPDATE3]
Upon further investigation, TED.com have decided to completely retract the entire speech, naming it “misleading”.
[UPDATE4 25/06/09]
With TED having researched the grounds of these allegations and subsequently removing the video and retracting the entire thing, Chris Hughes still wants to pass this off as a fluke. I have yet to see an updated blogpost, or a reply to my emails. As such, let me make it perfectly clear for the last time, for future reference.
Chris Hughes took Mikko Haapoja's tutorial on using FLARToolkit and Papervision3D, two open source projects they were not involved in at all. Then they did some slight modification of the tutorials, not adding, or extending anything and recompiled the examples. They then went on stage saying “He programmed” etc…
In reality, they passed someone else's work off as their own, without giving attribution or even mentioning the projects, rather just claiming credit for it in an interview, and obfuscating what they did both online and in their presentation.
End of story.

Thanks to the recent run-up in gas prices, many of our email accounts have become cluttered with chain emails asking us to boycott major gasoline stations on a certain date in the future. The reason being, we're pissed about having to pay so much for gas and if we all band together for one day and refuse to buy gas, we're supposedly going to cost the major gas companies billions of dollars and force them to drop the price of gas.
For those of you who continually forward these emails to everyone on your contact list, please stop. This is one of the most ridiculous ideas out there and it would never work.
There are plenty of extremely logical and obvious reasons why this tactic would never work, yet most of us tend to overlook these as we focus on trying to place blame for the nearly 40% jump in the price of gas since the end of February. As is usually the case, logic tends to take a backseat to emotion.
That being said, I'm going to try my best to explain why this idea won't ever work in the real world and why you should automatically delete any emails like this that you may receive.
The first (and most obvious) reason is you are simply delaying the purchase of the gasoline you need; we're not actually decreasing the demand for gas (which might bring the prices down), we're just shifting the demand to another day in the very near future.
For example, let's say that 100,000,000 people decide to join this boycott, which causes 1,000,000,000 fewer gallons of gasoline to be purchased on that particular day. In theory, this would cost the major gas and oil companies about $3 billion in revenue.
However, you mean to tell me that during the next couple of days that those 100,000,000 people aren't going to go back to the gas stations to purchase the gas that they didn't buy the day they were boycotting? Of course they're going to; they still need all that gasoline in order to get to work, drive the kids to soccer practice, etc.
There wasn't a drop in demand, just a shift in demand – which means that the gas companies don't actually lose the $3 billion in revenue, they just get it within the next couple of days.
The second reason is if for some insane reason this boycott tactic actually worked and did cause the gas companies to lose money, do you actually think that these companies would lower prices to gain back the small percentage of their total annual revenue that they lost? I highly doubt it.
The more likely scenario would be these companies would actually slightly RAISE prices in order to try and collect some of the money that they may have lost.
Hopefully it has become pretty obvious that the only way we're going to be able to save money on our car's gasoline is to reduce the demand for gasoline by driving less and driving more fuel efficient vehicles. It's not going to come by some crazy scenario where we boycott gasoline stations for one arbitrary day.
So on that note, please take me off of your spam list.
ON DECEMBER 24th 1860 the government of South Carolina issued a “Declaration of the Immediate Causes Which Induce and Justify the Secession of South Carolina.” The proclamation stated that the “ends for which [America's] government was instituted have been defeated, and the Government itself has been made destructive of them.” Six southern states followed suit in the ensuing six weeks. On March 11th 1861 representatives from those seven states ratified the constitution of the Confederate states of America, and a month and a day later troops from the Confederacy opened fire on Fort Sumter, a United States sea fort off the South Carolina coast. Thus began America's civil war.
On November 7th 2012—the day after Barack Obama was re-elected—a petition appeared on the “We the People” White House website, which is a means for citizens to engage in their first-amendment right to “petition the Government for a redress of grievances”. It asked the federal government to allow Louisiana to secede from the United States. Since then, petitioners from all the other 49 states have requested that their states be granted permission to secede.

The White House promises that any petition that gathers more than 25,000 signatures within 30 days will receive an official response. As of November 27th, petitions from Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, North Carolina, Tennessee and Texas had all crossed that threshold. Larry Scott Kilgore is preparing not just to run for governor of Texas on a secessionist platform in 2014, but to change their name to Larry SECEDE Kilgore. So, should the north start dusting off those blue Union uniforms? Should New Orleanians prudently prepare to bring their passports when they head to Chicago?
They need not. For one thing, secession is illegal. It was arguably so when the southern states did it the first time, but the Supreme Court established it beyond a doubt in Texas v White, decided in 1869. Americans dissatisfied with their government do of course have the right to emigrate, but they do not have the right to sunder the union in a fit of pique.
Second, there are far more loyalists than secessionists. Take Texas: its petition leads the pack with over 117,000 signatories. Not all of them are from Texas but, even if they were, that would amount to roughly less than half of 1% of the state's total population or, to put it another way, roughly 1/28 as many Texans as voted for Mr Obama (he may have lost Texas decisively, but they still won more votes there than they did in Illinois, Pennsylvania or Massachusetts). Louisiana's signatory-to-population ratio is closer, but it still falls well below 1%. Even Rick Perry, governor of Texas and no fan of the federal government, has opposed the drive for secession. As for Mr Kilgore, they ran for governor as a secessionist in 2006 and 2010 and failed dismally; there is no reason to suspect they will do any better this time.
Besides, if push truly ever came to shove, one suspects that most of those paper secessionists would grudgingly accept that they and their states are far better off inside than outside the United States. They benefit from a common defence, interstate commerce and America's fiscal union—particularly the latter, as most of the states that have crossed the 25,000-signature threshold receive more in federal funds than they pay in taxes. Their citizens have paid into Social Security. Many of them receive Medicare. Besides, without the federal government to complain about, southern Republicans would have to come up with a whole new platform.

The Israel Air Force struck a Hamas base in the Gaza Strip's north early on Thursday, hours after several live rounds were fired from the enclave toward houses in an Israeli border town.
No one was injured by the gunfire that hit Kibbutz Nativ Ha'Asara on Wednesday night, but three houses were damaged by the bullets, according to a statement from the Israel Defense Forces.
The IDF said it struck a Hamas military facility where the gunfire originated. It said it views Hamas "as the only party responsible for what goes on in the Gaza Strip, and for maintaining the quiet in the region."
The army's initial assessment was that the gunfire was accidental. A Hamas training facility, built after last year's Operation Defensive Shield, occupies the area just over the border from the kibbutz.
A synagogue on the kibbutz was damaged in a similar incident last April.
Sirens sounded on the kibbutz and the adjacent Kibbutz Yad Mordechai early Wednesday morning. According to the IDF, the sirens were probably triggered by the unsuccessful launch of a rocket from Gaza.
A rocket fired from Gaza exploded in an open area in the Eshkol Regional Council last week. There were no injuries and sirens did not sound. In response, the Israel Air Force struck targets in the center of the Strip.
At least 27 people, including several police officers, have been wounded in a car bomb attack in front of a police building in Cairo, according to Egypt's interior ministry.
The powerful blast struck northern Cairo district of Shubra al-Khaima in the early hours of Thursday morning.
"A man suddenly stopped their car in front of the state security building, jumped out of it and fled on a motorbike that followed the car," the interior ministry statement said.
"The car exploded wounding six police officers."
There were no immediate reports of deaths from the explosion, which made a wide crater near the four-storey building, shattered its windows and destroyed a major part of the front portion of a surrounding wall, according to AFP news agency.
A vehicle engine lay metres away from the entrance as police cordoned off the site to prevent crowds of people from gathering, and broken metal parts of a car lay scattered on the ground.
Front glass windows of three buildings near the site were also shattered.
String of attacks
Thursday's blast comes weeks after the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) claimed a car bomb attack targeting the Italian consulate in Cairo on July 11, which left a passer-by dead.
That attack was the first such targeting a foreign mission in Egypt since the armed groups began their campaign against security forces two years ago after the army's ouster of President Mohamed Morsi in July 2013.
The consulate bombing was followed by the abduction and apparent beheading of Croatian engineer Tomislav Salopek, which the ISIL-affiliated Sinai Province group claimed on August 13.
Armed groups say their attacks are in retaliation for a police crackdown targeting Morsi supporters that has left hundreds dead and thousands jailed.
Hundreds of members of the now banned Muslim Brotherhood have been sentenced to death in mass trials since President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi took control of the nation of 87 million in a coup.
Many of them have won retrials, and Morsi himself, sentenced to death last June, has appealed their verdict.
Though criticised by rights activists, supporters of Egyptian president have backed the crackdown on political opponents.
Inside Story: Seeking a solution for Egypt's troubled Sinai Peninsula
The bombing came just days after President Sisi ratified an anti-terrorism law which critics claim gives wider powers to police, restricts human rights and muzzles the press.
The law, published in the government's official gazette on Sunday, sets a minimum fine of 200,000 Egyptian pounds (about $25,000) and a maximum of 500,000 Egyptian pounds for anyone who strays from government statements in publishing or spreading "false" reports on attacks or security operations against armed fighters.
Three journalists had already been sentenced to up to 10 years in prison for "defaming" the country and supporting the blacklisted Muslim Brotherhood movement.
The retrial of three Al Jazeera journalists - Baher Mohamed, Mohamed Fahmy and Peter Greste - was adjourned for a tenth time on August 2.
1. The BBQ (2602 Greenmount Ave., [443] 468-2131): I had been hearing about The BBQ for weeks before I made my way over to Greenmount Avenue to try it for myself. The place features a steady soundtrack of gritty blues, and offers smokey, meaty mains like pulled pork, pit beef, chicken, and ribs. Then there are the sides, which can make or break a place like this: mac and cheese, collard greens, sweet and savory baked beans, and more—they're all great. Maurice Bradford, who owns and runs the place along with their son, welcomed me, and offered me a free sample of their homemade peach cobbler. They also said they were looking to expand their section of Greenmount to make it feel more like a community spot with outside seating and live music. I can't wait to see what they do next.

2. Ida B's Table (235 Holliday St., [410] 844-0444, idabstable.com): The “modern soul food” tribute to Ida B. Wells opened this fall on the ground floor of The Real News Network (full disclosure, a Beat affiliate) with husband-and-wife team Chef David Thomas and Tonya Thomas at the helm, bringing done-up Southern staples (frog legs, fried chicken) and unexpected fusion (fry bread tacos, kimchi reuben sandwiches) to downtown. Serving up breakfast, brunch, lunch, and dinner made from locally-sourced ingredients, plus a fully-stocked bar with craft cocktails, Ida B's extensive menus boast mostly hits and actually something for just about everyone, and the ample space and warm service make for the kind of true Southern hospitality Baltimore needs. (Maura Callahan)
3. Blacksauce Kitchen (401 W. 29th St., blacksaucekitchen.com): Open only on Thursdays with a changing menu announced day-of, this Waverly Farmers Market legend went brick and mortar this year, giving a bit more access to its specifically mindful and inexplicably delicious take on barbecue and soul food. The effect is something that still feels special but accessible and never exclusive. And it's all about the little things: its neo-soul and post-Rawkus Record hip-hop soundtrack blasting while you wait; the affable service (if you go more than once they will almost surely remember your name and thank you for returning); and even the look of the place, with a variety cookbooks displayed on shelves and photos on the the walls, including one of the Sterling's Crab and Oyster House that used to occupy the space—a small acknowledgement of past that matters a lot amid a moment of rapid development and rewriting. (Brandon Soderberg)
4. New America (429 N. Eutaw St., (443) 388-8576, facebook.com/NewAM): A project of artists and cooks and artist-cooks, the January opening of New America in the Charles Fish & Sons building helped combat the city's dearth of good diners with dishes that find strength in simplicity—including some of the best brunch food we've had a while. The space has become as much of a venue as it is a restaurant, regularly hosting film screenings, poetry readings, drawing nights, and more. As the diner's name suggests, the food and atmosphere feel distinctly American, though less in the Wonderbread-and-apple-pie kind of way than a continually expanding and adapting series of intersections. (MC)
5. Rye Street Tavern (225 E. Cromwell St., ryestreettavern.com): Rye Street Tavern is a seafood lover's dream. Go with the wood-grilled Maryland rockfish, a plate of shrimp, creamy stone-ground grits, and smoked tomato beneath a sweet, tender cut of rockfish with a crispy grilled skin; or the lightly breaded, fried popcorn softshell clams served with fragrant jalapeno peppers and a tartar sauce drizzle. And with a different Maryland crab appetizer for each day of the week, a waterfront view, and the main dining area's open-kitchen concept so you can check out the chefs hard at work, Rye Street Tavern does seafood and just plain American food only with five-star service. (Arli Lima)
6. 16 On The Park (800 N. Wolfe St., pyramidrestaurantgroup.com/collection/16-on-the-park): This rooftop restaurant atop the new Residence Inn Hotel in the Johns Hopkins Medical area offers a sweeping view of the city and a focus on seafood. That it is a standout along with Rye Street Tavern, which also opened this year and works within the same good-food-gone-a-bit fancy theme, makes it even more impressive. In part, this is due to 16 On The Park's versatility—in particular, its sleek outdoor patio and raw bar (Raw Bar On The 16)—and its exceptional entrees: seared chicken served with fresh vegetables and pan jus, and roasted fingerling potatoes served alongside a prime wagyu flat iron steak are forever fighting it out for best plate. Even the crab cake—served with a garlic aioli—is a whip smart spin on a typical dish. (Arli Lima)
7. Miss Carter's Kitchen (218 N. Liberty St., [443] 630-8255, instagram.com/misscarters_kitchenllc): You'll know you're near Miss Carter's Kitchen, a particularly delicious soul food spot, before you even arrive because of all the energy emanating around it, especially at night when the Liberty Street establishment feels alive with people and food and fun. This is your expected soul-food-and-such-in-styrofoam-containers done with a more personal, family-run touch. On man, the sides—the potato and seafood salads, the seasoned french fries—and a particularly good and sweet half-and-half are standouts. You'll find the wait for your food a delight as you chat it up with whoever else is in line or perhaps, probably, Miss Carter herself. (Brandon Soderberg)
8. The GruB Factory (1210 N. Charles St., [443] 602-7018, facebook.com/thatgrublife): It takes someone bold to even introduce another vegan place into Baltimore—the monolithic Land of Kush looms—and while there should not be this “there can only be one” logic, it remains, in part because Kush is so good and in part because non-vegans are often picky. So welcome to Baltimore, GruB Factory, and thanks for the seitan, made in the kitchen and unmatched. The relatively small menu is a bonus—they know what they do well—and makes it easier for the vegan skeptic, who won't be one anymore once they try the french toast platter and taste its almond milk batter with agave honey mixed in. (Brandon Soderberg)
9. Minnow (2 E. Wells St., Suite 116, [443] 759-6537, minnowbaltimore.com: Minnow opened in South Baltimore in May, just a block away from another local gem, Hersh's. The two now form one of the best culinary one-two punches in Baltimore. Minnow is owned by Ben and Jake Lefenfeld, who also own La Cuchara, and while it's had some menu changes since opening, it is now one of the more creative and whimsical destinations in Baltimore. Chef Drew Lesoveck is slinging some inventive dishes on the seafood-forward menu but that L.D.F. dry aged burger, with its squid ink bun and umami sauce, is a stand-out and a standard for all other burgers in Charm City. Other highlights include the whole “Bait” section on the menu: shareable bites served in quaint sardine tins. If you're looking for a cocktail, try the Smoke & Fire and Love Potion #8. If you want something with a lofty name that lives up to its billing, give the F* That's Delicious (bourbon, amaro, cava) a try. (Leandro Lagera)
10. Showroom at Motor House (120 W. North Ave., [410] 862-0930, motorhousebaltimore.com/showroom-cafe-bar): Showroom is Andre Mazelin's newest creative venture melding food, drink, and art. It's the anchor café and event space for Motor House (formerly Load Of Fun). Aptly named, Showroom is housed on the showroom floor of a former car dealership that used to reside in the building. The spot includes a spacious bar and a back room with plenty of cozy nooks along with a fully equipped stage for live entertainment. At the helm of the kitchen is Daniel Horowitz, founder and executive chef of The Pantry, a local catering company. They're slinging food from breakfast to lunch most days and have a killer happy hour from Tuesday to Friday (all night on Thursday). The menu is an eclectic mix of international flavors and the bolsitas, which are essentially bags of goodness with a range of flavors from Mexican to Tex-Mex to Mediterranean, represent what Horowitz is trying to accomplish. As for the cocktails, and there are many, but don't pass up the No. 9, especially since the menu describes it as a “tiki variation of a sazerac.” (Leandro Lagera)
On the Eve of Our Repression: Communiqué on The Squatting Struggle in Oakland 2/10/13 by Some Oakland Anarchists
Monday Feb 11th, 2013 12:36 PM
Communique on Immanent Squat Evictions in Oakland
In our time squatting we've learned unconventional methods of survival. A blurring of means and ends. Not least of these is the ability to adapt, to disappear from one circumstance and hold our ground in others. To understand the difference between defensive and offensive actions.
And once again, the need for action and for offense rises in our hearts. The calls for passivity and obedience ring hollower each day, as building by building our autonomous experiments collapse at the intervention of the Police or the County Pigs. We are forced to look at the escalating repression of squatters and autonomous spaces from within the situation, as new partisans in a social war of evolving terrain.
*The Stayaway has received notice to vacate for Wednesday, February 13th at 6:00am,
*The Hot Mess/RCA Compound (Oakland's Squatted social center) teeters at the outer limit of ability to delay eviction in court, with a final judgement ruled against them on February 8th. Both spaces could face raids on or before Valentine's Day.
The forces of Capital and Order have been chopping the Bay up like a pie, each slice more lucrative than the next. Hot Mess/RCA stands as a bulwark of autonomy amidst a West Oakland landscape that is rapidly transforming into posh condos and shops for the petit-bourgoise of San Francisco's commuter class. An anonymous communiqué from BayofRage published last year spells out the plans for The MacArthur Transit Village, and in a broader sense, the MacArthur Corridor, of which Hot Mess/RCA occupies an important point on:
“Once constructed, the Transit Village will be more a part of San Francisco than of Oakland. The transit village is designed as a commuter enclave. Without ever stepping into the surrounding north Oakland neighbourhoods, yuppies can live near BART, travel to and from work and, on their Friday nights, visit the upscale restaurants on Telegraph. This is not to say that the Transit Village will have a neutral effect on surrounding areas.... there is talk of revitalizing an ailing neighbourhood or, worse, reducing the existing neighbourhood to a blank canvas on which developers can capitalize on a “booming real-estate market.”...the construction on the Transit Village can be anticipated to bring an increased security presence, a fresh assault on graffiti and street art, and scores of new residents sympathetic to the police and unaware of the neighbourhood in which they live.”
- “Oakland is for Burning? Beyond a Critique of Gentrifcation” Bayofrage.com
The Stayaway is an intervention on a different aspect of Capital's restructuring project- the Foreclosure Crisis. This four unit apartment building in the Highland neighbourhood was foreclosed on by Bank of America and left squalid and vacant for years. Bank of America left the house to rot, but in November 2011, squatters were invited by an adjacent neighbor to restore the building, and they methodically scaled back the ivy and blackberry vines that were threatening to swallow the entire property.
The Stayaway is only one among the tens of thousands of foreclosures that have swept across Oakland since 2008. The majority of these foreclosures were on families of color, especially Black and Latino residents of West and East Oakland. In 2011 and 2012, over 40% of foreclosed property sales were to Real Estate Investment groups, not families or individuals with planned tenancy.
This glut in foreclosures has led to countless stories of blighted and vacant properties forgotten by their Mega-Bank owners, who found themselves unable to juggle the thousands of homes they were now responsible for maintaining. The Stayaway has frustrated Bank of America tirelessly in their efforts to resist eviction, having already fended off the Sheriffs successfully in September of 2012 through a combination of barricades, thorough planning, and the presence of over 40+ supporters upon the Sheriffs 8am arrival.
But the eviction notices have come anew, and that is why on the eve of coming repression we find it necessary to define the terrain of our struggle, to elaborate a discourse on autonomous spaces that is simultaneously more than a How-to-Build-The-Barricades manual and more than a screechy list of our grievances and injuries. We are not a militant vanguard , nor are we liberal Citizens clamouring for our rights. We are a counter-power, organized outside of the logic of rental agreements and mortgage payment, landlord and property value. Our ability to hold and maintain space rests not our lines of credit, or valid immigration documents, or building our home-additions up to code: instead our social fabric is woven from a will-full rejection of all of these things.
We'll examine the evident:
1. Capital and the State have begun a massive restructuring and up-scaling of the Greater Oakland area that is inherently hostile to our project of growing autonomous spaces.
2. This re-organization by its nature will seek to eradicate autonomous spaces by swallowing them back into Order and Society. Every formerly Autonomous space will be tamed by re-imposing the social relationships of the Landlord, the Leaseholder, the Tenant, and the Home-Owner.
3. Every eviction of an autonomous space strengthens global capitalism and weakens our ability to organize against it. These evictions reinforce the oppressive social and economic relationships we are seeking to live outside of.
Will-fully Erased
The trajectory of a “Renovated Oakland” in the era of San Francisco's second Tech Boom is as obvious as it is alarming- the creation of infrastructure for an extended commuter metropolis, new surveillance systems with the latest cameras, and the proliferation of Private Security “Ambassadors” who work with business interests and the police to maintain control of the streets. San Francisco will tower over the west coast as a model of The New Tech City, responsible for much of the social infrastructure that increasingly comes to define middle and upper class identity in the era of smart-phone Facebook log-ins and OkCupid dates.
Gentrification and development will march in lock-step through the very streets on which we had once sought reprieve from them.
Social Centers will be demolished to build condos, and squats in foreclosed homes will be evicted by Investment Groups, who will oversee their gutting, remodelling, and finally their marketing for sale.
Much of our shared history of resistance here will be willfully erased, not only by bulldozers and development but in the minds of the new social class arriving that will have neither seen nor care to see the battles for freedom that we've waged here, in recent years and across history, from the Indigenous Ohlone People to the Black Panther Party.
To Draw a Line in the Sand
Against these lapping waves of repression we choose to draw a line in the sand, across our doorstep and before the boots of the fascists. We look at these “Notices to Vacate” from within the situation and understand all the threat of violence that piece of paper implies, the entire Apparatus of State power that throws their weight onto these documents.
We have not forgotten the multiple raids on autonomous spaces here in Oakland and San Francisco.
We have not been deaf to the repression of autonomous spaces close to us in Portland and Seattle.
We have not been blind to the crackdown on squatters in Moscow, Athens, Barcelona, and throughout the world: on the contrary we have watched closely and found recognition of our struggle in yours. They are the same struggle, the same position against the system that is not reducible to ballot-casting or Voting Yes, but a real and tactical position in contested territory of the Social War.
We have exhausted ourselves in the courts of Bourgeois justice, stretching our knowledge of legalese and eviction law to their extent. But the courts were not able to save us; they were not designed to legitimize our struggle. Instead, we return to the defensive position we began in, holding a space and refusing to move.
Our call then is not only for the protection and defence of The Stayaway and the Hotmess/RCA, but for a renewed offensive of cracking houses in the San Francisco Bay Area and throughout the world: One, One Hundred, One Thousand Squats! And if we succumb to eviction, then we would see the boarded windows of our former homes fall to the crowbar and hammer, we would see the fences clipped full of holes and torn down for the continuance of our struggle for new social arrangements in opposition to the system.

Why put the burden of cleaning and maintenance on your employees when there are commercial businesses who can offer professional cleaning services? Hiring a commercial cleaning service has many benefits. Here, we are going to share the top 5 reasons to hire a commercial cleaning business:
1. Better Productivity
It is easier to stay organized when your workspace is clean. Productivity tends to increase when there is a clean, uncluttered work area with. This also results in less distractions and increased focus. Should you have clients visiting your business regularly, a professionally cleaned office will make a strong impression on them. This also allows your clients to focus confidently on the business at hand, not being distracted by what they might feel is a lack of cleanliness.
2. Healthy Employees
We all know very well that cleanliness is closely related or connected with health. If you hire a commercial cleaning business, your clean office space will result in healthier employees and less sick days. This can directly result in your and your employees being more productive throughout the year. Most germs and bacteria grow and thrive in business environments because many areas are under constant use. The more employees you have, the more germs and bacteria that are left behind each day that can spread and infect co-workers.
3. Increased Morale
There are many companies out there who offer commercial cleaning services at affordable rates. You just have to find the one that bests suits your needs and will improve the morale of your business. Coming to work to a clean and neat office gives one a sense of starting the day fresh. Having your space vacuumed for you and your trash taken out makes you feel taken care of.
Through commercial cleaning all your employee will be able to concentrate on their designated responsibilities without having to worry about routine cleaning duties. This allows each department to focus on what they were hired for with a positive attitude.
4. High Quality Service
A commercial cleaning business will offer high quality service because this is their area of expertise. They have the appropriate commercial cleaning equipment and knowledge to thoroughly clean a commercial space in an efficient manner. They possess the products and methods to keep your premise sparkling clean and healthy.
In addition to basic cleaning services, most companies offer custom cleaning to meet any special needs or request of their clients.
5. Cost-Effective
Another reason why you should hire a commercial cleaning service is that is cost-effective. The amount of time you would spend cleaning the space yourself can be better spent either working or with family. In addition, professional cleaners will complete the job more throughly and in a fraction of the time it would take you to do the same.
With plenty of work in the day, more work can be done. A company can increase production simply because a commercial cleaning service was integrated. Businesses are more efficient when all those involved focus on their strengths.

Stacey Ross, Jr., 20, was killed Tuesday night after police say they and four others tried to force their way into a man's apartment at Carolina Place Apartments on Delaney Drive in Jacksonville.
District Attorney Ernie Lee says the resident, who hasn't been identified, fired in self defense.
Police were able to track down the other four people involved in the attempted home invasion.
Joshua Cordts, 18; Sean Padgett, 18; Steven Lewis, 18; and Haleigh Noling, 17, were all charged with attempted armed robbery with a dangerous weapon and conspiracy to commit robbery with a dangerous weapon.

Wales voted leave by a margin of 52.5%. It is an interesting case study of how people voted against their own material self interest, to increase their precarity, and to become even poorer than they already are. Daniel Evans argues in this text that ‘turkeys voting for Christmas' is an apt metaphor for what happened. Before the referendum, they also predicted that that the EU could become a scapegoat for Wales' massively alienated populace and that Wales could indeed vote to leave.
If nothing else, the Brexit vote, and its (increasingly visible) xenophobic underpinnings should finally put paid to the saccharine, nauseating myth of Welsh (specifically ‘valleys') progressivism, as well as the equally ludicrous notion – which has always been a necessary adjunct to the ‘progressive South Wales' myth – that Wales' rural Welsh speaking communities (who voted remain) are parochial and racist.
For those of us who have actually grown up in the area and are not blinded by this rose tinted portrayal of (South) Wales, the result was less of a shock. South Wales, like the British Labour movement itself and many other former industrial areas, has always been underpinned by a latent British imperialism, which historically co-existed quite comfortably with the radical syndicalism, and later with social-democracy that Wales became known for. This reactionary element occasionally manifested itself in race riots (see here for another example) or in militant support for imperial wars but more often was simply implicit in voting Labour. Although Marx, Engels and even Lenin pointed this out consistently in their analysis of the British labour movement, it has always been ignored by the Labour intellectuals who serve as the gatekeepers of Wales' official ‘story'.
This version of Wales – which has to be contextualised within the history of the British labour movement and the British working class more generally – may be unpalatable, but one cannot really understand the social conservatism and xenophobia which motivated the leave vote in working class areas without confronting the history of imperialism, not to mention the steady drip of nationalism (sometimes twee, sometimes overtly jingoistic) which permeates the British public sphere and media, from sports to music to beer adverts.
Why did Wales vote to leave?
There have already been many very strong analyses of why Wales voted to leave, so in this follow-up piece I'll simply return to my own predictions before reflecting upon what Brexit might mean for Wales' future.
1) In my original article I said that Labour's hegemonic dominance in Wales could potentially influence the result and bolster to remain vote, through their dominance of local councils, the media, etc. I was wrong about this: people stuck two fingers up at Labour. In the end, their local and national dominance counted for nothing. The result points to the actual fragility of Labour's ‘dominance'. Whilst they are in control as long as people do not engage in politics, they have no influence over the legions of people in Wales who do not normally vote – the powerful force which helped swing it for the supporters of a Brexit. Turnout in Welsh Assembly elections has never risen above 50%, whilst the turnout for the referendum was 71.7%.
2) Next, I said the significant amount of in-migrants from England might bolster the leave vote, based on the historic preponderance of English-born people in the Tory vote in Wales and stats which suggested a similar over-representation within the UKIP vote in Wales. Whilst the relevant statistics have not come out yet, there will almost certainly have been a split in the English vote in Wales. Working class in-migrants to places like Denbighshire will have probably voted Leave, whilst cosmopolitan in-migrants and students from England almost certainly swelled the Remain vote in the counties of Ceredigion, Gwynedd and places like Cardiff- something I had not factored in. So whilst I wasn't strictly wrong, I placed too much emphasis on the role of in-migrants in the Leave vote – the Welsh did not need votes of ‘the English' to turn them into Brexiters.
3) I suggested that maybe the staggering amounts of EU money that have been spent in Wales' poorest communities since 2000, made tangible through the ‘paid for by EU' signs which dot the landscape, could potentially influence people's views of the EU and remind them of its relative generosity when compared to the British state. This was wrong. These signs and other totems of EU benevolence, although now painfully prominent (to me at least), went evidently completely unnoticed by people or were simply ignored.
What was also significant when I spoke to people in Blaenau Gwent was that the people who did know about EU funding complained that it had been spent poorly. In my previous article I noted that much of the EU money had been squandered and spent on white elephants. But whilst some of the money was wasted, much of the EU money has been spent on town centre improvements, buildings (and lately, precious infrastructure like roads). To me, these always seemed to be wise investments, but they ultimately seem to have been an irrelevance to the most deprived sections of society. What went wrong with Objective One spending? A ruthless, long overdue inquest about the previous use of EU money must now begin, and must absolutely influence what happens to Wales' last, and therefore most precious tranche of funds.
4) I said that the democratic deficit in Wales, combined with grinding poverty, could contribute to the EU becoming a scapegoat in the eyes of the people. This, as we know, came true, and compared to this, all the other factors pale into insignificance. Frustration and alienation were the overriding emotions which contributed to the Leave vote in Wales. A depressed, angry and disenfranchised populace had their discontent channelled by a relentless and simple leave campaign, which transformed the vote from one about 'the EU' into a general, catch-all protest vote against ‘the establishment', as well as scapegoating immigrants.
5) I said before that Wales' information deficit – the complete lack of a national media – would influence and underpin the campaign. This was the most easily predictable element. Of course, the Brexit debate in Wales had no Welsh angle. The limited Welsh media dedicated relatively little time to the referendum, but even if they had, it wouldn't have mattered, such is the dominance of English focused news media. The narrative was about ‘British wide' issues such as immigration, security. The distinctiveness of the Welsh policy context and the distinct ramifications for Wales in the event of Brexit (the importance of EU funding, for example) was not mentioned. When people said ‘our country' they meant the UK, not Wales, conflating two very different entities. There was no way, in the end, to reframe the debate in specifically Welsh terms; no way of refracting the anti-EU bias of the English media; no way of channelling people's anger away from a Leave vote.
The referendum again merely serves to underscore the debilitating effects of the absence of a Welsh public sphere. It was clear, for example, that many people in the deprived areas which voted Leave had no idea about objective one funding at all. They did not know that such a significant chunk of Wales' overall income over the last 16 years has come from the EU; that their job might be funded by the EU, that their child's free childcare centre is funded by the EU. People were scared about immigration in areas with the lowest levels of immigration in Europe because they were not told otherwise.
But we can pore over the how and why indefinitely. The important question now is not so much ‘why did this happen?' but ‘what now for Wales?', as the repercussions of this vote will likely be felt for generations.
Wales, already impoverished, is set to get even poorer. Carwyn Jones' staggering incompetence in not having any plan for Brexit and not lobbying the British government at all prior to the referendum (apparently it was ‘too political'), means they did not obtain any guarantees about having this funding matched, and in all likelihood these desperately needed billions will not be replaced. Wales faces a Tory government shorn even of the faux ‘compassionate' veneer of Cameron's reign. Theresa May is not an ardent pro-devolutionist and will not care too much about the Barnett formula.
Constitutionally, Brexit will likely be the crisis which ultimately leads to the break-up of the UK. The political and socio-cultural gulf which exists between Scotland and England is now insurmountable. With ‘indyref 2' a very real prospect, former no voters have already begun signalling their intent to vote yes, unsurprisingly preferring the notion of an independent (quasi) social-democratic Scotland within the EU to the prospect of an isolated, Tory controlled UK. A union which survived wars, depression, strikes, Thatcherism, will finally be undone by the power struggle between two Etonian rivals.
The prospect of Scotland leaving the UK has huge ramifications for Wales. What might happen to Wales in a reconfigured, Scot-free UK?
The silver lining of the leave vote is therefore that it should – although I won't hold my breath – prompt some soul-searching. It must trigger a national conversation in Wales about politics, the nature of devolution, our economic model, the media, and so on. For once, we have to think long-term about our future. The result has usefully illuminated many of the stubborn problems that a post-Brexit Wales – whatever its constitutional status – must confront and tackle. As Richard Wyn Jones points out, the reality is that the Leave vote demonstrates the failures of devolution. Had the leave vote not happened, it may well have been possible to continue to ignore these problems or gloss over them, as Carwyn Jones' government is so adept at doing. No longer.

Heyyyy, Reddit…
Tony Hale—the Emmy-winning actor best known for playing Buster Bluth in Arrested Development and Gary Walsh in VEEP—seems perfectly happy to embrace their tendency to play endearingly neurotic characters.
When asked by redditor Richard_Shaft if they worry about being “typecast as a weird timid guy in future projects,” Hale writes, “Weird and timid is interesting. Bring it on!”
As they prepare for the finale of VEEP‘s fifth season, Hale addressed their fans' most urgent (and awkward) questions in a Reddit AMA (Ask Me Anything)—from how much they improvise in scenes with Julia Louis-Dreyfus to their dream role as a comic-book villain.
Here are the highlights from their AMA.

University of Queensland investigates paper by ex-staff member citing 'no evidence' of research
Updated
The University of Queensland says a Parkinson's disease study published by a former staff member may not have actually been carried out.
The university released a statement today saying that "no primary data can be located, and no evidence has been found that the study described in the article was conducted".
UQ has asked the academic journal that published the research to retract the article, and the journal has agreed.
The university said Professor Bruce Murdoch, a former staff member from the university's Centre for Neurogenic Communication Disorders Research, was one of the authors of the article.
Titled "Treatment of articulatory dysfunction in Parkinson's disease using repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation", the article was published online in October 2011 in the European Journal of Neurology.
An investigation is continuing and the Crime and Misconduct Commission has been informed, the university's statement said.
UQ has also returned a $20,000 grant from "a non-government organisation" because it fears the money was allocated on the basis of information in the article.
It said there was no National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) funding for the paper.
"By having the paper retracted, the university enables the global scientific community to learn that the research reported in the paper has no place in the body of scientific knowledge and so cannot be used as a basis for further research," the statement said.

In their first radio address as President-elect, Barack Obama made this strong statement:
"[We will] ensure that the rescue plan that passed Congress is working to stabilize financial markets while protecting taxpayers, helping homeowners and not unduly rewarding the management of financial firms that are receiving government assistance."
That's an important marker - this Financial Week story shows, the corporate community takes the declaration seriously. All of that is good news. As Naomi Klein ably shows, fixing the bailout is not just a piddling side project - if left the way it is, it could cripple the economy.
That said, it looks like the Bush administration is going to do everything it can to keep things just the way they are.
Buried in the Washington Post's paean to George Bush's newfound commitment to transparency and bipartisanship, we get this nugget ascribing a more pernicious motive to the niceties:
Likewise, the administration is laying the groundwork for an unusual level of access to the Treasury Department and other agencies involved in attempts to stabilize the foundering economy. White House spokesperson Tony Fratto said Friday that Treasury is preparing office space that will allow Obama aides to sit alongside current dministration officials. Fratto said such efforts are intended to send a signal that Treasury's approach will not change too abruptly when Obama takes office. (emphasis added)
There you have it - in newspaper print, no less. The current administration on record saying the objective of involving Obama's transition team in Treasury decisions is to try to coerce that team into backing off Obama's own promises (to use the Times' own phrasing) to abruptly change Treasury's current approach.
Now, I don't think for a second the scheme is going to fully work. Obama's not filling their first economic declarations with promises of bailout reform with the intent of allowing a humiliated Bush administration to stop him. I may be cynical, but I'm not cynical enough to believe that Obama goes totally flaccid on this issue. They saw the presidential exit polls showing the bailout bill is more unpopular than ever. And they clearly have the capacity to understand that a poorly executed bank rescue could destroy their ability to right the economy.
That said, anyone who has worked in government knows things are never black and white. When expectations are forged, subtle pressure administered, and devilish details written, it can be difficult to convert foundational principles into federal law, especially when you are effectively sharing power with another power player (in this case, the outgoing president).
Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The moment the MOAB bomb struck the IS cave and tunnel system
The top US military commander in Afghanistan says the decision to use a powerful bomb in the country was based purely on tactical considerations.
Gen John Nicholson said the most powerful non-nuclear bomb ever used by the US in combat had been the right weapon to target a suspected Islamic State (IS) base in Nangarhar province.
A 300m (328yds) long network of tunnels and caves was destroyed, they said.
The US coordinated the attack with Afghanistan, Afghan officials said.
About 36 suspected militants were killed, according to Afghan officials, but IS has denied suffering any casualties.
Known as the "mother of all bombs", or MOAB, the device was dropped on Thursday evening by an MC-130 transport plane, falling in Nangarhar's Achin district.
Chief Executive of Afghanistan Abdullah Abdullah said the attack had been carried out in co-ordination with their government and "great care had been taken to avoid civilian harm".
When IS announced the establishment of its Khorasan branch - an old name for Afghanistan and surrounding areas - in January 2015, it was the first time the group had officially spread outside the Arab world.
'Lightning like a thunderstorm'
"The enemy had created bunkers, tunnels and extensive mine fields, and this weapon was used to reduce those obstacles so that we could continue our offensive in southern Nangarhar," said Gen Nicholson.
US and Afghan forces at the site saw "no evidence of civilian casualties", they added.
US President Donald Trump called the strike "another successful job".
Local eyewitness Qari Mehrajuddin first saw "lightning like a thunderstorm" followed by the roar of an explosion, they were quoted as saying by Reuters news agency.

"I thought there was a bombing just outside my home," they added but, in reality, the blast was around 5km (three miles) away, according to Reuters.
The 21,600lb (9,800kg) bomb also destroyed a large stash of weapons, the Afghan defence ministry says.
IS commander Siddiq Yar was among those killed, presidential spokesperson Shah Hussain Murtazawi told the BBC.
IS fighters in the tunnels had "come from Pakistan and were persecuting people in the local area", they added.

The clue is in the ungainly name - the MOAB or GBU-43/B massive ordnance air blast is the US military's most destructive conventional (that is non-nuclear) bomb.
It is a huge weapon and is GPS-guided. It was dropped from a MC-130 aircraft - the US Special Forces variant of the Hercules transport. The weapon is carried on a special cradle inside the aircraft from which it is extracted by a parachute.
Its principal effect is a massive blast over a huge area. It is a larger version of weapons used during the Vietnam War.
The Trump administration's policy towards Afghanistan remains under consideration but the use of this weapon sends a powerful signal that IS is top of the administration's target list wherever its offshoots may be found.
Achin district governor Ismail Shinwary told the BBC that Afghan special forces, with the help of American air support, had begun anti-IS operations in the area 13 days ago.
They said IS targets had been bombed regularly but "last night's bombarding was very powerful... the biggest I have ever seen".
A member of an anti-IS group in the area who gave their name only as Mohammad told the BBC all civilians had left the area since the start of the anti-IS operations.
Achin resident Mir Alam Shinwari told Reuters that IS were "not human beings, they are savages".
"They used to marry our daughters and wives to their fighters, blamed residents for spying, they beheaded, cut [off] hands and did not allow mobile phones that had cameras," they said.
AUSTIN, Texas — For Collin Klein, preparation for the last two ballgames has been limited mostly to film and conversations with coaches.
Kansas State coach Bill Snyder disclosed Saturday that their junior quarterback had missed practices the past two weeks while trying to heal from assorted aches absorbed running the ball more than any other quarterback in the Bowl Subdivision.
"It's been all mental reps, really,'' Klein conceded.
The lack of practice showed as Texas seemed to read virtually every shifty move Klein attempted, though the Wildcats still edged the Longhorns 17-13 in Royal-Memorial Stadium.
Any big plays they managed were huge against Texas as the Cats were limited to 121 total yards. Klein, himself, was limited to 4 yards rushing on 26 attempts, while going 9 of 17 passing for 83 yards.
However, they tossed a 16-yard touchdown to Chris Harper to give K-State a 10-3 halftime margin, and they also crashed in from the 3-yard line for the Cats' other TD with 6:59 left in the third quarter. Otherwise, Texas held Klein in check. Just not enough to produce a win, largely because the Wildcats won the turnover count, 2-0.
"Give Kansas State credit. They didn't make any mistakes,'' UT coach Mack Brown said. "Our defense played great; our offense was sporadic. But we had a chance. If you told me we would hold Collin Klein to four yards rushing and 83 yards passing, I would have known that we won the game.''
Careful what you think you know. Such assumptions can lead to Pinstripe Bowl runs, which the Longhorns may be on if they don't get off the six-win qualification number for bowl eligibility.
K-State must improve, too. Snyder made that abundantly clear. As always, Klein heard the message.
"He was very frustrated,'' Klein said. "I can speak for myself, I was very frustrated that we weren't able to get anything going and weren't able to support the kind of performance our defense gave. We're just going to come back to work and keep getting better.''
NO POSSESSION EDGE
For the first time all season, Kansas State failed to claim an advantage in time of possession, controlling the ball for just 28 minutes against Texas.
The teams came in ranked one-two in the Big 12, primarily because they have been the best in the conference at running the ball.
Still, the Wildcats converted all three red-zone possessions into scores with two touchdowns and a field goal.
"We were able to get in barely enough points to win,'' Klein said. "We just have to get better.''
INCENTIVES AVAILABLE
The salary Texas pays Mack Brown is tops among head football coaches in the Bowl Subdivision, according to a list published last week by USA Today. Brown is compensated $5,192,500 annually.
More than half of the FBS coaches (64) make more than $1 million annually. K-State's Bill Snyder falls into that group at $1,925,000.
Snyder's contract also includes $455,000 in performance incentives. Among those still attainable going into Saturday's game against Texas was a BCS bowl appearance ($75,000), an appearance in the Cotton, Alamo, Insight or Holiday bowls ($35,000), the Walter Camp, Eddie Robinson or Bear Bryant coach of the year award ($30,000), a top 10 spot in the final AP or BCS ratings ($100,000), and a top 20 spot in the final AP or BCS ratings ($50,000).
BEASLEY ON COTTON LIST
Jonathan Beasley, the Wildcats' offensive graduate assistant, is on this year's ballot for the Cotton Bowl Hall of Fame.
Quarterbacking K-State to a 35-21 win against Tennessee in the 2001 game in Dallas, Beasley threw for 210 yards and two touchdowns while adding 98 yards rushing and another TD.
Beasley was one of 58 on the ballot for the Cotton Bowl hall, including 10 coaches. Voting ended Friday.
K-STATE QUICK KICKS
� Representatives from the Fiesta, Cotton, Alamo and Holiday bowls attended Saturday's game.
� The fourth-quarter sack by Adam Davis was K-State's first since the Oct. 22 win at Kansas.
� A moment of silence was observed before kickoff for Oklahoma State women's basketball coach Kurt Budke and assistant Miranda Serna.
� The Wildcats came out with a four-wide formation, then went to five-wide with Torell Miller, who has one reception on the season.
� The 100,705 who attended the game represented the largest crowd to ever watch K-State.
In advance of Super Bowl LI, we take a look at the top 10 stats to know for the New England Patriots and Atlanta Falcons, and a few bonus stats involving both teams:
Patriots
1. The Patriots will be playing in their ninth Super Bowl, which will break a tie with the Broncos, Cowboys and Steelers for the most appearances.
2. If they were to lose, the Patriots (4-4) would tie the Broncos (3-5) for the most Super Bowl losses. If they win, they'd tie the Cowboys (5-3) and 49ers (5-1) for the second-most wins behind the Steelers (6-2).
3. Tom Brady is the all-time leader in Super Bowl completions (164), passing yards (1,605) and passing TDs (13). (More details on Brady's accomplishments here.)
4. The Patriots have won all four meetings against the Falcons since Brady became the New England starting quarterback in 2001. The Falcons are one of seven teams Brady has not lost to as a starter.
5. At 39 years and 186 days on Feb. 5, Brady will be the second-oldest quarterback to start a Super Bowl, trailing only Peyton Manning last season. Brady could become the oldest Super Bowl MVP, and they could become the first four-time winner of the award.
6. Super Bowl LI will be Bill Belichick's 36th postseason game, tying them with Tom Landry for the most among head coaches.
7. Belichick was the third-oldest coach to win a Super Bowl two years ago. If they win again Sunday, he'll be the second-oldest, behind only Tom Coughlin.
8. The Patriots led the NFL in scoring defense this season (15.6 PPG) for just the second time in franchise history. The other was in 2003, when they also won a Super Bowl played in Houston.
ESPN Stats & Information
9. The Patriots have not scored in the first quarter in any of their previous six Super Bowls during the Brady/Belichick era. The Patriots scored 130 points in the first quarter during the regular season, second only to the Falcons (139).
10. Dion Lewis has played 16 games in two seasons with the Patriots (including postseason), and New England has won them all.
Falcons
1. With the Falcons' appearance, the NFC South has now sent all four teams to the Super Bowl, the only division to do so since division realignment in 2002.
2. The Falcons led the NFL in scoring for the first time in franchise history this season, scoring the eighth-most points in NFL history (540). No team to score that many points won the Super Bowl, however.
3. Atlanta ranked 27th in defensive scoring this season, allowing 25.4 points per game. That's second-most ever by a team to reach the Super Bowl.
4. The Falcons have won their past six games, averaging 39.0 points per game in those contests. They have one giveaway and 13 takeaways in their past six games.
5. Atlanta scored a touchdown on its opening drive in eight straight games. No team in the last 15 seasons has had a streak longer than five straight games
6. By the time Super Bowl LI is played, Matt Ryan will have gone two full months without an interception. Ryan's last interception came on Dec. 4 against the Chiefs. He's thrown 212 passes since their last interception.
7. Ryan has thrown seven passing TDs and zero interceptions this postseason. Six quarterbacks threw more TDs with no picks in a single postseason, and all won the Super Bowl.
ESPN Stats & Information
8. The Patriots are one of two teams Ryan has never beaten (the other is the Steelers). Ryan is 0-2 in their career against the Patriots, with the last meeting occurring in Week 4 of 2013 (lost 30-23)
9. Ryan has thrown at least three passing touchdowns in four consecutive playoff games, the longest streak in NFL history.
10. Julio Jones is averaging 110 receiving yards per game in five career postseason games, the highest average since the merger among players who have appeared in more than two playoff games.
Bonus stats
1. This will be the sixth Super Bowl since the 1970 merger where the top-scoring offense (Falcons) meets the top-scoring defense (Patriots) from the regular season. The top-scoring defense has won four of the five previous meetings.
2. The Patriots and Falcons turned the ball over 11 times apiece during the regular season, tied for the fewest in the NFL. This will be just the second Super Bowl matching the two stingiest teams in terms of giveaways. The first was Super Bowl XVI when the 49ers defeated the Bengals.
3. With the over/under currently at 59 (Westgate), this would be the highest total in pro football championship history.
“Many don't realize that we developed most, if not all, of the fixes out there that are marketed or portrayed as methods to defeat tracking, precisely as a method of conducting that tracking.”
Herzeliya, June 15 – Israeli military and defense figures speaking at the annual Herzeliya Conference told the audience today that as a preemptive measure, the IDF will soon release detailed information on the pornography consumption by every important Hamas and Hezbollah official.
Former IDF Chief of Staff Benny Ganz and Chairman of the Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee in the Knesset Yuval Steinitz both referred to the initiative, which is a product of AMAN, Israel's military intelligence apparatus. Both of them said the project was a pilot begun under a previous administration, and was ready to be launched formally, but has been operating more or less than planned for a number of years. The officials declined to disclose exactly how long.
The initiative, called Publicizing Opponents' Regional Net Habits for Use in Battle (PORNHUB), uses technology developed by the Israeli military to tap into networks used by enemy commanders and political leaders, and defeats the techniques those figures used to conceal or delete the evidence of their pornography habits, said Ganz.
“Most people think that encryption, deleting browser history, and getting rid of cookies on one's device are enough to eliminate or hide traces of online activity one doesn't want known to others,” explained the retired general, part of whose tenure included oversight of PORNHUB. “What many don't realize is that we developed most, if not all, of the fixes out there that are marketed or portrayed as methods to defeat tracking, precisely as a method of conducting that tracking. The only thing that's actually concealed is our monitoring of those internet connections.”
In fact, said Steinitz, the project's initial diagnostics were so promising that it was modified to include the launching of several streaming pornographic video websites that became wildly popular, one of which carries the name of the project itself, as a kind of inside joke by the development team. “Creating a set of sites – that are a runaway success, I might add, bringing in enough to make this project self-funding – was intended to make it easier to lure our targets to a more centralized network of content.”
While Steinitz and Ganz did not reveal the project's budget or significant details of its activities, the former general told conference attendees that Hamas leader in Gaza Ismail Haniyeh appears to have a weakness for little boys, that Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah prefers mothers seducing their stepsons, and self-proclaimed Islamic State Caliph Abu Bakr Al-Baghdadi has established profiles on at least four gay dating sites.

The European Parliament's chief Brexit negotiator, Guy Verhofstadt, lists President Donald Trump and their chief strategist Steve Bannon as “one of the main three existential threats facing the European Union.” Verhofstadt views Trump and their populist policy advisers as an even greater threat to the EU than Brexit itself.
Peter Foster reports in The Telegraph:
Setting out the three main existential crises threatening Europe, Mr Verhofstad listed radical Islamic terror, the revanchist Russian president Vladimir Putin and their funding anti-EU, far-Right parties and destabilizing Europe and Donald Trump, the new US president.
“We have a third front undermining the European Union, and it is Donald Trump who has joined [the far-Right parties] from across the Atlantic. They have talked fairly favourably of other countries wanting to break away from the EU, and that they hoped for disintegration from European Union.”
Mr Verhofstadt singled out the ”enormous influence” of Steve Bannon, the Breitbart News founder who is now chief strategist to Mr Trump and was recently promoted to enhanced positions in the US National Security Council.

Among the measures of core inflation used to monitor the inflation outlook, the series excluding food and energy prices is probably the best known and most closely followed by policymakers and the public. While the conventional “ex food and energy” measure is a composite of the price changes of a large number of different products and services, almost all models developed to explain and forecast its behavior do not distinguish between the goods and services categories. Is the distinction important? Here, we highlight the different behavior and determinants of goods inflation and services inflation and suggest, based on preliminary analysis, that we can improve the forecast accuracy of this conventional core inflation measure by combining separate inflation forecasts of the two categories.
As specified in the Federal Reserve Reform Act of 1977, the Federal Reserve's mandate is “to promote effectively the goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates.” Given long and variable lags between changes in monetary policy and the subsequent impact on the economy, meeting these goals is greatly facilitated by being able to accurately forecast the behavior of inflation over a one-to-two-year horizon. This, of course, is easier said than done, as headline inflation measures, such as Consumer Price Index (CPI), tend to be quite volatile, due in large part to sharp swings in energy and food prices.Because of the volatility in headline inflation, policymakers have relied on core inflation measures designed to differentiate between transitory and persistent price changes to help guide their decision making. Among the measures of core inflation, the “ex food and energy” series has been the most widely adopted for this purpose (see this paper by Timothy Cogley for a discussion of other core inflation measures). This measure, shown in the chart below, is a much less volatile series that is indicative of lower-frequency changes of the general price level and has also proved to be a more accurate predictor of headline inflation than past headline inflation.However, models developed to explain and forecast core inflation—such as Phillips curve models—do not have a particularly good track record, to the point that there is disagreement regarding the fundamental determinants of inflation.One possible explanation for this state of affairs is that core inflation is a composite of the price changes of a large number of different products and services that behave quite differently over time. The next chart presents core inflation at one level of disaggregation—commodities less food and energy commodities (or core goods) and services less energy services (or core services). Note that the absolute level of inflation of these two categories is quite different as are their weights in the core CPI; the weight of core goods was 34 percent in 1985, but was just 26.1 percent in 2012. Additionally, over the past decade, the two inflation rates have generally moved inversely to each other.It seems likely that the divergence in the behavior of goods inflation and services inflation may also carry over to their determinants. To explore this idea, we examine the relationship over the period since 1985 between each inflation series in the previous chart and two variables considered to be important in predicting inflation: long-run inflation expectations and the level of domestic resource utilization. Resource utilization provides a gauge of the balance between aggregate demand and supply in an economy. One of the most widely used measures of domestic resource utilization is the unemployment gap—the difference between the unemployment rate and the estimate of the time-varying Non-Accelerating Inflation Rate of Unemployment (NAIRU) from the Congressional Budget Office (CBO).The next two charts present scatter plots of the four-quarter-ahead inflation rates (period t to t+4) of core services and core goods, respectively, less a measure of ten-year expected CPI inflation (period t) from the U.S. Survey of Professional Forecasters, versus the CBO unemployment gap (period t). For core services, there is a nonlinear, negative relationship between the inflation rate and the unemployment gap. For core goods, however, no such relationship is present.
What Explains Movements in Services Inflation and Goods Inflation?
Based on the three charts above, the behavior and determinants of core services inflation and core goods inflation differ significantly. Can we say more about this? To do so, we have developed and estimated separate models for core CPI services inflation and core CPI goods inflation using quarterly data from 1986:Q1 to 2012:Q4. We can provide the following summary of the results.
The core services inflation model draws upon the modeling approach outlined in this Federal Reserve Bank of Boston paper by Jeffrey Fuhrer, Giovanni Olivei, and Geoffrey Tootell. We find a strong relationship (both economically and statistically speaking) between core services inflation and long-term inflation expectations. There is also an important nonlinear relationship between core services inflation and the unemployment gap, indicating that the impact of changes in labor market slack on core services inflation depends on the level of slack itself.
For the core goods inflation model, the results suggest a very different set of factors influencing the behavior of the series. We find persistence in the series, that is, core goods inflation depends on its own past value. Relative import price inflation—growth in (non-petroleum) import prices less core goods inflation—also matters, suggesting goods prices act as the linkage between supply shocks and core inflation. There is also evidence of a relationship between core goods inflation and expected inflation, but that the relevant inflation expectations are associated with a short-term (one-year) horizon. Last, we find no meaningful effect of the unemployment gap on core goods inflation, consistent with commentators who contend that it is global (and not domestic) economic slack that impacts core goods inflation.
The Whole versus the Sum of the Parts
Taken together, the evidence supports the view that the behavior and determinants of core services and core goods inflation are quite different. Why might this matter? Based on some preliminary work, there appear to be gains in the forecast accuracy of aggregate core inflation from using separate models for core services inflation and core goods.
The estimated models can be used to generate forecasts of core services inflation and core goods inflation, which can then be combined using the relative weights of each category in the core CPI. To provide a basis of comparison, we also produce forecasts from an estimated Phillips curve model of aggregate core CPI inflation that uses long-term inflation expectations, the unemployment gap, and relative import price inflation as explanatory variables.
We estimate the models from 1985:Q1 to 2004:Q4, and then forecast out-of-sample for the post-2004 Q4 period. To construct forecasts of the “composite model,” we use weights of 28 percent for core goods and 72 percent for core services—the relative weights in the core CPI in 2004. As shown above, the forecasts from the composite model capturing the differences in the determinants of the inflation process of core goods and core services are over 65 percent more accurate than the forecasts from the Phillips curve model ignoring those differences. While both models generally track the slowing in core inflation during the recent recession, the forecasts from the composite model have done a better job picking up the subsequent rebound in core inflation. Although they are not shown, we obtain similar results based on the post‑2007 Q4 period.
While we recognize our analysis is preliminary, the results suggest that a further exploration of core services inflation and core goods inflation and their role in the core inflation process is warranted.

For Immediate Release, February 16, 2017 Contact: Noah Greenwald, (503) 484-7495, ngreenwald@biologicaldiversity.org Texas Senator John Cornyn Introduces Bills to Gut Endangered Species Act Legislation Would Delay Species Protection, Burden Federal Wildlife Agencies, Increase Extinction Risk for America's Wildlife WASHINGTON— Senator John Cornyn (R-Texas) introduced two bills today to substantially weaken protections for endangered species. The “Endangered Species Act Settlement Reform Act” (S. 375) would make it harder for citizens to ensure species are considered for protection in a timely fashion. The bill would give local governments, Big Oil, Big Agriculture and other industries the right to veto settlement agreements requiring the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to make decisions about the protection of endangered species. “Senator Cornyn's bill would do nothing but make it harder for America's imperiled wildlife to get the endangered species protections they so desperately need,” said Noah Greenwald, endangered species director at the Center for Biological Diversity. “Cornyn's bill would allow industry and local politicians to needlessly delay protection, almost certainly causing the extinction of more of our native plants and animals.” Delays in species protection have been a persistent problem. On average species have waited 12 years to receive Endangered Species Act protection, and more than 40 species have gone extinct waiting for that protection. Studies show citizen lawsuits have targeted species that are highly imperiled and been effective at speeding protection for species. “Cornyn's bill is a solution looking for a problem,” said Greenwald. “What the agency needs is more funding to do its job, not bills that give the oil and gas industry special rights. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has a workplan specifying when it will make decisions for hundreds of species in need of protection, and litigation to enforce deadlines is the lowest it's been in decades.” Cornyn's other bill, the “21st Century Endangered Species Transparency Act” (S. 376), would place additional burdens on the already beleaguered Fish and Wildlife Service by requiring that it publish all studies and other documents relied on for protection decisions online. Such documents are already available upon request, meaning the bill would merely require unnecessary busywork for the agency. Even worse, the bill may further endanger species by requiring publication of sensitive location information that could put species at risk of poaching. “Like other Republicans in the pocket of the oil and gas industry, Senator Cornyn is totally out of step with the majority of Americans who support strong protections for endangered species,” said Greenwald. “Passage of these bills would be an absolute disaster for America's imperiled wildlife.” The Center for Biological Diversity is a national, nonprofit conservation organization with more than 1.2 million members and online activists dedicated to the protection of endangered species and wild places. www.biologicaldiversity.org
European Coal Emissions Plunge 11% In 2016
April 5th, 2017 by Joshua S Hill
European emissions from coal fell by an impressive 11% in 2016, according to analysis of new figures published by the European Commission this week.
At the end of March, the European Commission published preliminary 2016 data under the European Union's Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS). European non-profit think tank Sandbag analyzed the data, finding that total European Union (EU) ETS stationary emissions fell by 2.4% in 2016, from 1803 million tonnes in 2015 to 1759 million tonnes in 2016.
Additionally, Sandbag's analysis found that the “aggressive fall in EU ETS emissions is because of falling power sector emissions.” Specifically, EU power sector emissions fell by 4% in 2016, thanks in part to a decrease of 11% in coal generation. Natural gas emissions climbed, offsetting somewhat the decline in coal, as the closure of numerous coal plants required natural gas to step into the gap.
Unfortunately, according to Sandbag, “The ETS carbon price did almost nothing: a €5/tonne carbon barely changed the relative coal-gas economics.”
Nevertheless, since 2010, overall power sector emissions have fallen by 19% due to massive clean energy investment, helping to see coal's generation emissions fall by 16% over the same time.
Almost half of the fall in coal emissions during 2016 came due to plant closures in the UK, which itself saw a massive 58% year-on-year fall in coal emissions. Since 2010, the UK's coal plant emissions have fallen by an impressive 71%, and according to Sandbag, “Nearly every UK coal power plant has seen its generation collapse, thanks to the UK's carbon price floor – an £18/tonne top up to the EU ETS price.”
However, the UK wasn't the only contributing factor, with big coal emissions decreases in Spain (27%), Greece (21%), and Italy (17%). Unfortunately, the two biggest polluters in the EU saw the smallest reductions. German coal plant emissions fell by only 4% in 2016, and Poland coal emissions only fell by a measly 1%. In fact, since 2010, coal emission decreases have been comparatively small — a decrease of only 5% for Germany and 7% for Poland.
“Coal power plant emissions fell by an impressive 11% in 2016,” explained Dave Jones, Sandbag Electricity Analyst.
“But emissions from Europe's 280 coal power plants still accounted for 39% of total EU ETS emissions. It is clear that phasing out coal in favour of renewables is the quickest and cheapest way to rapidly reduce ETS emissions, and policymakers must figure out how to make this happen. A near-zero carbon price is doing nothing to help this. The low carbon price is also stalling industrial decarbonisation, where emissions have fallen by less than 1% in the last four years.”

Last week, I spoke to activist and libertarian talk show host Adam Kokesh. Less than 24 hours later they were taken into custody by federal agents.
Kokesh is an Iraq War veteran. In 2007, they were issued a general discharge from the US Marine Corp after being photographed by the Washington Post while attending an Iraq Veterans Against the War protest in their uniform. The resulting incident made the papers and the national commander of the Veterans of Foreign Wars publicly backed Kokesh, then accused the Marine Corps of trying to silence and punish members of the military for exercising their constitutional rights. This would be the first in a series of controversies surrounding Adam and their politics.
Adam's latest agenda is probably their most controversial to date. A couple of weeks ago on their talk show Adam vs The Man, Kokesh announced their plans to celebrate Independence Day by marching into the nation's capital with 10,000 followers, all of whom would be armed with loaded firearms.
Adam and I talked on the phone for nearly a half hour about, among other things, their protest, privacy and security, and their Jeffersonian values. While their motivations aren't always clear, one thing was obvious: Adam Kokesh does not like the US Government. It's not that they hate the people running the government, but they believe government has invalidated itself by betraying the principles from which it was founded. At times Kokesh sounded downright anarchistic, but overall they were more empowered by the idea that government should belong to the governed.
The day after our conversation, Adam was arrested at "Smoke Down Prohibition," a public protest for the legalization of marijuana that takes place every month in Philadelphia. Basically, large groups of people gather in public and simultaneously spark up joints or smoke bowls of weed to protest the fact that it's illegal to do so. Also, they get high. It's not complicated. Before last Saturday, no arrests had ever been made at one of these events, despite the fact that police were always present and laws were broken every time.
There are several videos on YouTube that document the moments before and during Adam's arrest. In one of the clearest videos, Adam isn't sparking up. They continue talking into the microphone while everyone else is flicking their Bics. Within seconds, the police move in and Adam yells, “Everybody gets closer. Show some love. Come on, we're going to make it difficult for the police here.” That didn't work out so well.
Moments later, Adam is being dragged away from the crowd by police. They don't appear to be committing any crime in the video. In fact, the only charges against them are for events that transpired after they were engaged by the officers: assault on a federal police officer, impeding the duties of a federal police officer, and resisting arrest. Almost immediately after being grabbed by the officers Adam's hands go up into the air, palms up, signaling that they have officially surrendered and isn't resisting arrest. No assault of any kind appears to take place.
According to Lucas Jewell, Adam's podcast manager, the arrest is in direct response to the upcoming Independence Day march, not the Smoke Down Prohibition demonstration. "They walked by a big black guy with dreads smoking a blunt and snatched Adam when they hadn't done anything illegal." The fact that Adam was originally taken to a local jail but then picked up by agents and transferred to a Federal detention facility has only fueled this theory.
Kokesh went before a judge at 1:30 PM Monday and was reportedly silent the entire time. According to Jewell via the Adam Kokesh Facebook page, another hearing was scheduled for this Thursday. Jewell writes: "The reason for the detention hearing is because Adam will not speak on if they own fire arms [sic] or their address."
It's unclear if Adam will be released in time to conduct their march on DC, if it will be canceled, or whether the arrest will inadvertently cause even more people to show up on July 4 with loaded weapons slung over their shoulders. If the arrest was indeed a preemptive strike by law enforcement attempting to stop the open carry march before it took place, the tactic of targeting Kokesh in public might very well backfire.
Here's part of my telephone interview with Adam Kokesh from Friday, May 17.
VICE: Hi Adam, thanks for talking with me. How many people have signed up to join your open carry march?
Adam:The total is over 4,000 now, so we're well on our way to meeting our goal of 10,000. There are a lot of people who have signed up by e-mail who said they're going to be organizing buses. So I think with all of the support we've gotten outside of Facebook we're close to 10,000 already.
Is your protest specifically just about the 2nd Amendment or is there a broader theme behind your armed march?
It's definitely broader than that. While the 2nd amendment is an important part of how we are able to keep government in check— at least the founders intended it that way—this is really more about fundamentally altering our relationship with government and making sure that the government fears the people and not the other way around.
You allude to a famous Jefferson quote often. They said, “When the people fear their government, there is tyranny; when the government fears the people, there is liberty.” What exactly does that mean to you?
The people have to live in such a state that their rights are privileges because they know the government can take them away at any time; I think that's the state of fear of government that a lot of people live in today. When that's the case it's because rights are threatened. When you fear someone else it's because they are a threat to you peacefully exercising your rights. Human beings are capable of ruling their own lives and shouldn't have other people exercising authority over them in any way. But, in a situation where the government truly exists at the pleasure of the people, then the government should constantly be in fear of the people and should acknowledge that at any time anybody in government can lose their job, or, as the founders said in reference to the declaration, the people have the right to alter or abolish said government.
How do you feel about these recent public comments by President Obama: "Unfortunately you've grown up hearing voices that incessantly warn of government as nothing more than some separate, sinister entity that's at the root of all of our problems... They'll warn that tyranny is always lurking just around the corner. You should reject these voices."
Well, in a way, everything they said is perfectly true because the government is not a separate entity as a product of the will of the people. In the other sense, when they say that the people who say "tyranny is around the corner," it's true that they're lying. In any sense that you'd be able to define it, tyranny is already here. If the government is corrosive and only sustainable by assertively violating your rights, I would say that it already is. I think those saying tyranny is around the corner are really the one's that are saying there is some hope left in the political system or if you just do what we say, we're going to be able to fix this or if we just believe in the conservative hype we'll be able to vote our way to liberty.
In the sense that Obama meant it, of course it was absurd that they were saying "don't worry, everything is OK." It's an insult to the intelligence of their audience to suggest they don't know better.
Some people say the notion that the 2nd Amendment is in jeopardy is just a weapon of mass distraction; that gun control is just the next divisive topic to help Democrats and Republicans continue to appear different on the issues now that the polls have shifted on gay marriage. Do you agree with that?
I think most Republicans don't have any credibility when it comes to claiming that they're different from Democrats. The gun control debate is a little more significant than the gay marriage debate. I understand it could be a distraction from the real exploitation that the federal government represents but it's so much more fundamentally important because it deals with the nature of government as a violent monopoly. If you challenge that monopoly they don't like it. There's often a negative reaction and they arrest people illegally, as we've seen in Ohio, in Texas, and events all over the country where people are openly carrying legally and end up getting arrested, accosted, and sometimes assaulted by police officers. So, we're using the gun control to speak to something that goes a lot deeper.
Do you think gun control arguments politicize tragic events such as the Newtown shooting or are the debates necessary?
I think it's necessary to quell the knee-jerk reaction of those who would turn to government to attempt to solve problems, but that's why those conversations happen. Whenever there is a tragedy the government seeks to exploit it. You know, never let a good crisis go to waste. So, I think it's important that we fight back and resist that when there is such a tragedy and this is one way of doing it.
While we're on the topic of politics and guns, do you think the tens of millions of dollars spent by groups like the NRA place the value of the money above our influence as individual citizens on the political process?
I think, really, the problem of money's influence on politics isn't the money that is used to communicate ideas for whatever reason. The problem is that people are willing to vote without thinking. In a sense, voting is an act of aggression because you are saying that if I happen to have the majority when I cast this ballot, it's legitimate for the government to force my will on you; to name a leader for you that has certain policies that you may or may not agree with. To impose a tax on you or pass a law that is going to be forced on you. As long as people believe that somehow voting is appropriate as a way to organize society through force, then we're going to have a problem with influence from various places that are going to try to effect how people vote and who the guns of government are pointed at. I think that's a much deeper problem.
Is privacy the civil rights issue of our generation?
That's a good question. I think it's a very important issue as we see our lives fundamentally altered by technology. I think, in a way, technology provides great mechanisms of accountability. I'm not against surveillance, in a sense. I'm looking forward to having a camera mounted in my contact lens. It's really just a matter of who's controlling it, who is doing what with that data, and who is accessing it for what purposes. But I think privacy is going to become something that we're also empowered by technologically to create for ourselves if we need to. The problem is when you have this technology in the hands of government.
The information we're talking about when we talk about privacy... we're talking about the NSA recording every single digital phone call that takes place in the United States. Every single one. And we found that out unequivocally after the Boston bombing when it was revealed that the FBI was going to “find these conversations.” And you're like... there it is. The question is, who controls this information? Should it be a gang of violent thugs in our government? Absolutely not. But should we have that record? Should it exist? I think so.
It was recently revealed that the Justice Department obtained the telephone records of journalists working at the Associated Press. You're a member of the media, you have your own show. Do you feel this is an all-out assault on the 1st Amendment?
Do I think it's an assault against the 1st Amendment or is it just more intimidation? I don't know, because when I heard about that story and it was the Associated Press that was being targeted, I was definitely surprised. What happened to the AP is not unique to journalists, it's the entire American public. I think we all are threatened by this and we should be worried if it turns out that the government is targeting and influencing journalists—I think that the record is clear now that they have. Is it an assault on the 1st Amendment? The 1st Amendment is a bunch of words on paper. The assault is on individuals and their privacy. All of these transgressions just demonstrate how illegitimate this government is. If there is such a thing as legitimate government, this is not it.
Going back to your protest on July 4th, if the police chief does amass a police presence on the Arlington Memorial Bridge to prevent your demonstration from entering DC, how will you react?
If there is a line drawn then we will march up to that line and we will request permission to pass. If denied, then we'll take our grounds for a lawsuit with us and turn around peacefully.
Thanks for taking the time, Adam.

I've sometimes been accused unfairly of having a bias in favor of polyamory, or even being anti-monogamy, because I feel it's important that people realize they can make conscious choices about how they relate with others. In truth, there are many ways to structure and many options when it comes to the quality, clarity and communication of agreements on which intimate, loving relationships can be based. I know this because I've explored so many different ways of relating myself. In addition, I've helped thousands of people resolve relationship issues within and outside of the marital container. I'm the first to acknowledge that polyamory is not a good for every one. In the interest of full disclosure to those who rightly suspect that polyamory can exact a price from those who practice it, I offer the following survey of potential difficulties.
While polyamory sometimes offers advantages over enforced monogamy, polyamory can present numerous problems of its own. Some of these, such as social disapproval and , are artifacts of old structures and institutions that may well diminish in coming years. Others, such as a dearth of positive role models and perhaps even the prevalence of , are also likely to be temporary. But other difficulties with polyamory, such as the time demands and the emotional complexity of interacting intimately with more people, appear to be inherent to this lovestyle. I realize that the following examples may seem surreal to those who would never dream of trying a polyamorous lifestyle, but let's consider each of these potential costs and detrimental impacts in with open minds.
For many people, the risk of rejection by family, neighbors, , and coworkers is a major drawback to polyamory. For those who are strongly motivated to be seen in a positive light by others, this consideration alone is a dealbreaker. I was once married to a man whose was a near-perfect fit for polyamory. They had no particular desire for sexual exclusivity, they had strong interpersonal skills, and they were generally adventurous, but because being respected and admired in their community was of primary importance to him, polyamory was not at all attractive to him. Polyamory was very attractive to Jonathan, a man with similarly appropriate personality traits who consulted me about their concern that if they were inadvertently "outed," it would reflect badly on their wife, Victoria, who was beginning a new as a pastor. Jonathan and Victoria had successfully opened their over a decade ago, and now they were conflicted about their request that they return to monogamy. I had to advise them that their fears were realistic: monogamy would be a far safer choice at this juncture in their lives.
Social sanctions serve to keep couples such as Jonathan and Victoria, who would be potentially excellent role models, safely out of sight. I know of several group marriages and open marriages whose highly functional partners have chosen to keep their intimate lives private because they did not want to jeopardize other important work they were doing in the world by exposing themselves to criticism of their preferred lovestyle.
is one field in which polyamory presents an ever-present danger, particularly in an era where strategists desperate to win an election will publicize personal information that was once off limits to journalists. For example, former presidential candidate John Edwards was forced to withdraw from their campaign for the Democratic nomination in 2008 after their extramarital affair made headlines, as was front-runner Senator Gary Hart in 1987. Impeachment proceedings were brought against President Bill Clinton. In European countries, nonmonogamy is less of a political liability, but the prudent politician is still unlikely to announce that they or they are a supporter of polyamory. With so many politicians being exposed as nonmonogamous, those whose extramarital activities are consensual are easily lumped together with those who are cheating. Some have speculated that it might even be less politically damaging to apologetically admit an affair than to come out as polyamorous.
Nonmonogamous relationships have a reputation for creating emotional chaos and drama that is only partly a result of broken agreements and dishonesty, which are no more characteristic of polyamory than of monogamy. If partners are able to relate with self-responsibility and integrity, drama need not be part of polyamorous relating. Ethical polyamory is certainly possible. But as long as our culture endorses monogamy and socializes our young people to expect sexual exclusivity, we can expect jealousy to be a major challenge for those daring to confront it head on.
While polyamory has the potential to reduce , it also has the potential to increase stress. When a tense moment in a polyamorous relationship coincides with other stressors, an emotional meltdown may result and is often attributed to polyamory even though the relationship issues are only one factor. Nevertheless, if you are living a difficult and complicated life, you may not want to risk exposure to another possible source of worry.
If emotional upheaval goes with the territory of intimate relating, the chances of emotional upheaval increase exponentially when multiple partners are involved, at least until our brains have been rewired. Even when people think they have grown beyond jealousy and of abandonment, they can be surprised by a new situation that reactivates old issues. Some might see this as a wonderful opportunity to clear up emotional baggage they didn't know they had, but others would prefer to avoid these painful reminders. For example, Cheryl was relieved to have found a sense of peace and stability in their triadic relationship with Paul and Leslie after the year of emotional ups and downs that ensued when Leslie told Cheryl they wanted a sexual relationship with their friend Paul. When Paul asked if their former partner Harry could join them for dinner, Cheryl found themselves enraged for reasons they couldn't understand but soon realized they were afraid this dinner might be the start of another roller-coaster ride. They aren't sure if they were more afraid that Paul might leave them and Leslie to go back to Harry or that Harry might end up expanding their threesome to a foursome. They liked their life just as it was and didn't want any more changes. Living in the moment was a challenge for Cheryl, who found it hard to trust that change might make a good thing even better.
Challenges with and coordination are probably an inevitable part of polyamorous relating. One polyamorous woman complained that invitations to social events always presented a challenge as they never knew which partner they might end up being with at the time and what preferences they might have about attending. As one member of an eight-person intimate network put it, "Have you ever tried to get eight people to agree on where to go for dinner and then get them all out the door at the same time?" This kind of dilemma is common but, while relatively trivial, can take its toll over time. Nevertheless, it is likely to be less emotionally loaded than a conflict over who is going to with whom when everyone's preferences are different and time options are scarce.
Sally was leaving town the next day on an extended business trip. Oscar and Frank each wanted them to spend their last night alone with them. "I honestly didn't have any preference," Sally moaned, "and maybe that was the problem because they both wanted me to decide, and I didn't want to. I would have been happy for all of us to stay together, but that wasn't what they wanted. We ended up spending most of the night talking about what to do and why." Even when decisions about how much time to spend with different partners are not an issue, simply fitting several relationships into a busy life can send some people racing back to monogamy.
With all these difficulties, is polyamory worth the struggle? Why would anyone want to swim upstream when they don't have to? We'll take a look at this in my next blog. Or get a preview at www.lovewithoutlimits.com.

Joshua Mostel (born December 21, 1946) is an American actor.[1] The son of Zero Mostel, they are best known for their supporting roles in films such as Jesus Christ Superstar (1973), Harry and Tonto (1974), Sophie's Choice (1982), City Slickers (1991), Billy Madison (1995), and Big Daddy (1999).
Life and career [ edit ]
Mostel was born in New York City, the son of Kathryn Celia (née Harken), an actor, dancer, and writer, and comic actor Zero Mostel.[2] Their brother Tobias is a painter, ceramic artist and professor of art, teaching at Florida State University.[citation needed]
Mostel started their career as a boy soprano at the Metropolitan Opera in New York. They graduated from Brandeis University. Their Broadway debut was in 1971 with Unlikely Heroes. In 1973, Mostel had one of their most notable film performances as Herod in the Norman Jewison helmed Jesus Christ Superstar. In 1979, Mostel briefly starred in the television version of the film Animal House, Delta House, as "Blotto" Blutarsky, the brother of the character Bluto (played by John Belushi in the original film). They have since appeared in many films and Broadway productions.
On Broadway they appeared in the 1989 revival of The Threepenny Opera as Money Matthew, and as the frazzled head writer in the original production of My Favorite Year, opposite Tim Curry and Evan Pappas.
Mostel now lives in New York, with a summer home on Monhegan, Maine.

Wireless chargers for smartphones and other gadgets are convenient but there's a hitch: you have to leave your device in one place while it charges. A new self-adjusting design means that your smartphone could continue charging when on the move.
Current wireless chargers work through magnetic induction: when a charger and device are tuned to resonate with each other. Although existing designs are efficient when the power source and device are a fixed distance apart, it's more of a challenge if the device is moving.
Now Shanhui Fan from Stanford University and their team have developed a wireless charger that works even when a device moves up to a metre away from the power source. Its orientation can also change continuously without reducing the energy transfer. In a demo, the team was able to power a moving LED bulb without reducing its brightness.
Advertisement
To achieve the same thing with existing systems, circuits would need to be tuned constantly. “It adds complexity,” says Fan. “Our system is the first to achieve this without the need for active tuning,” they say.
The team did this by applying a concept that originated from quantum mechanics called parity-time symmetry. In this case, it involved coupling circuits in the charger and LED bulb so that the energy boost from an amplifier in the charger exactly balanced out the loss of energy as the bulb moved further away. The system automatically self-adjusts even when the distance between the bulb and charger changes. “I think it is interesting to see a basic physics concept find application in a completely different area,” says Fan.
Daniel Stancil from North Carolina State University in Raleigh thinks it's an exciting idea. “A smartphone could be charged while you are holding it or using it, without having to put it on a charging station,” they say. Although there are other ways of achieving self-tuning circuits, they think that the new approach is simpler and could be less expensive to implement.
Fan and their colleagues are planning to improve the range of their charger. They will modify the design to increase the charging distance, which could be useful for powering moving vehicles for example.
Wireless systems could one day be used to beam power over much greater distances. Another group, for example, is looking at using lasers and balloons to send power to disaster zones. Ultimately, they hope to generate solar power in space and beam it to Earth. It could allow more energy to be harvested than is possible on Earth, since energy from the sun is lost when it passes through our atmosphere.

Manchester City insist they will not let their large cast of unwanted fringe players leave for nothing despite knowing that if they cannot find buyers for players such as Craig Bellamy, Wayne Bridge, Emmanuel Adebayor and Roque Santa Cruz they will lose millions of pounds in "dead money" via the extraordinary salary structure at Eastlands.
The planned exodus began on Monday when Dynamo Kyiv confirmed they had agreed a £3.9m deal for Vladimir Weiss but City are having substantial problems shifting the other players who are now so far out of Roberto Mancini's plans that they train alone and are not even required to attend matches.
Many of those players will have to take huge pay cuts if they are to revive their careers but Adebayor's proposed transfer to Tottenham Hotspur sums up the problems facing City, with the forward determined not to lose the £150,000-a-week salary they earn for doing nothing more than a few gentle workout sessions at City's training ground.
Those figures are prohibitive for Spurs and, with City extremely reluctant to subsidise any part of the deal, the move is at an impasse as Adebayor, signed from Arsenal for £25m in the summer of 2009, continues to be excluded from the rest of Mancini's first-team squad.
The issues regarding these players can largely be traced back to the early part of the Abu Dhabi United Group's ownership when transfer targets recommended by Mancini's predecessor, Mark Hughes, were offered huge salaries to join the club. Those players have subsequently fallen out of favour under Mancini but their wages put them out of reach of potential buyers.
Bellamy earns a weekly figure of £95,000 and Celtic are the only club to have held significant talks about signing the striker before the transfer window closes at the end of the month. Bellamy, like Adebayor, has said they will not accept a lower wage and, unless something changes, could conceivably be left in the wilderness at City – paid millions of pounds but not even welcome to join in on the practice pitches.
Wayne Bridge is in a position of even greater uncertainty. The former England international left-back earns £90,000 a week yet is rarely seen at City these days. Apart from an inquiry from Newcastle United earlier in the summer, there has been virtually no interest from other clubs. Bridge could conceivably have to slash their wages by more than 50% to tempt any potential buyers.
City can expect to receive only a fraction of the fees they paid for these players but Mancini says the club will not contemplate letting them leave for free just to reduce their wage bill. "All these players have a cost," they said. "They are good players and, if there is a club that wants one of them, they must pay. I don't understand why we should have to pay a lot of money for them and others don't."
Shaun Wright-Phillips is a slightly different case on the basis that they are still allowed to train with Mancini's squad and their contract was agreed under the days of Thaksin Shinawatra's ownership, shortly before the Abu Dhabi takeover. Nonetheless, they still have a handsome £60,000 weekly salary, which potentially puts them out of the range of the clubs trying to sign him.
Bolton Wanderers have agreed a £2.5m fee and Wright-Phillips has already visited the club's training ground to have a look at their facilities but, again, it would require them taking a substantial drop in wages. Stoke City, Queens Park Rangers, Wigan Athletic, West Bromwich Albion all want to sign the winger, and Lazio have also contacted City.
Santa Cruz, who has earned around £8m in wages but started only eight matches, scoring four times, since signing from Blackburn Rovers for £18m two years ago, has attracted offers from Real Betis and Rayo Vallecano, both newly promoted to the Spanish top division.
The availability of the defender Nedum Onuoha has brought them to the attention of several Premier League clubs, including QPR, and they have employed Carlos Tevez's adviser, Kia Joorabchian, to help them find another club. Joorabchian has also become involved with the Dutchman Nigel de Jong, a key player who has just rejected the terms on offer for a new contract.

Iranian missiles will hit New York in “three to four years”. A nuclear Iran is like “50 North Koreas”.
This could be the sound of a deranged, dangerous sociopath, or this could be the sound of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin “Bibi” Netanyahu addressing the UN General Assembly.
Compare for yourself. Last week we had Iranian President Hassan Rouhani calling for the world to surf a WAVE (as in World Against Violence and Extremism).
This week we had Bibi saying that was a “cynical” and “totally hypocritical honey trap”.
In the world according to Netanyahu, “Ahmadinejad was a wolf in wolf's clothing. Rouhani is a wolf in sheep's clothing.” Rouhani tried to present themselves as “pious”, but he's always been involved with “the terror state of Iran”. He's like “a serial killer going to court dressed in clerical attire and giving testimony to their nature as an ‘ethical' and ‘religious' man.”
Ranting aside, Bibi did change their game. Now it's not silly cartoons and begging the US to bomb Iran virtually on a weekly basis. Now it's Iran's “military nuclear program” that must be shut down – a program, by the way, that the alphabet soup of US intelligence agencies says does not exist.
And this after Netanyahu told US President Barack Obama to forget – forever - UN Security Council resolution 242, which determined total Israeli withdrawal from all lands occupied after the 1967 war.
What a bomb
So let's get some things straight.
The state of Israel does not have any internationally recognized borders, and does not have an internationally recognized capital. It's bound to be perpetually expanding.
Israel has disrespected no less than 69 UN Security Council resolutions and has been “protected” from no less than 29 more, courtesy of US vetoes.
It has been occupying sovereign territory of Lebanon and Syria without giving a damn to UN Security Council resolutions.
Israel signed the Oslo Accords promising to stop building for good, any new settlements in Palestine. Instead, it has built over 270 new settlements. This is part of the slow motion ethnic cleansing of Palestine over the past six decades.
Israel has been threatening to bomb Iran on a weekly basis for at least three decades.
Israel is an undeclared nuclear power with as many as 400 nuclear warheads; refuses to sign the nuclear non-proliferation treaty (NPT); bars international inspections; never ratified the Chemical Weapon Convention Treaty; used chemical weapons on Gaza; and holds an undeclared stockpile of chemical weapons larger than any other nation in the Middle East.
Iran, on the other hand, has no nuclear warheads. Iran has signed the NPT and is inspected on a regular basis. Iran has not invaded another country for at least 250 years. Iraq under Saddam Hussein invaded Iran in 1980, but Iran did not occupy Iraqi territory.
The Israel lobby in Washington and the US Congress imposed a financial blockade on Iran, which for all practical purposes is a declaration of war. This has led to a massive depreciation of the Iranian rial – with drastic consequences for the lives of ordinary Iranians. Yet in their meeting with Obama this Monday in Washington, Netanyahu not only asked for more sanctions; they said Israel will unilaterally attack Iran if Rouhani's words are not followed by “action”.
The real “international community”, as in the overwhelming majority of the developing world, including the BRICS group of emerging powers, have all these facts at their fingertips. These facts help to see right through Bibi's game.
Just look at the map
The mere possibility of a US-Iran dialogue is the Israeli right's real “existential threat”. Bibi won't accept even Iran's right to enrich uranium for civilian purposes, accorded to it by the NPT.
A US deal with Iran is a win-win proposition for all; not only the two principals but energy-starved Europeans, the global economy, multinational corporations, you name it. Except for Israel.
Bibi's nightmare is the Islamic Republic of Iran not only as an independent geopolitical actor in Southwest Asia – which it already is – but also as a thriving regional power; in this aspect, the only way for Iran is up, considering its huge, young, well-educated population, its massive energy resources, it's fabulous location and its complex ties to South, Central and East Asia.
For the Israeli right, the status quo is ideal. Either we find US puppets such as the petro-monarchies of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC); or Arab secular republics that – with various degrees of Israeli input – have been mired in extreme turmoil, like Iraq and especially Syria.
It's very easy for Israel to maneuver among these actors; the Israelis can, for instance, rejoice with a military coup in Egypt (because the Egyptian military are no threat) while partnering with Saudi Arabia to try to bring down Assad in Syria. Middle East balkanization over sectarian lines is sweet as honey for Israel.
But Iran as an emerging economic/political power, with normalized relations with the US and Western Europe, it's a much more serious matter, “existentially” threatening Israel's supposed hegemony in the Middle East, which rests solely on its military muscle (not to mention hidden nuclear capability).
So much for Netanyahu 's obsession with regime change in Tehran - or the next best option, which is total isolation from the West (because as far as the East is concerned, Iran has thriving relations with all key actors in Asia).
The crucial point is that Iran's “existential threat” has been extremely useful for the Israeli right as a diversionary tactic, changing the subject from what's happening in real life; a nuclear garrison state/settler colony literally, graphically wiping a whole people - the Palestinians - off the map. When in doubt, just look at the map.
So here's where we are. Netanyahu is a hawk who swears by Eretz Israel – a “Greater” Israel with ever-expanding borders and undisputed military/nuclear hegemony in the Middle East. They have powerful allies; US extreme right-wingers and neo-cons, demented Republicans who will support anything as long as it's against Obama, a great deal of the Israeli-manipulated US Congress, large swathes of corporate media. They will stop at nothing to derail even the hint of an agreement between Washington and Tehran.
The temptation for the real “international community” would be to tell Netanyahhu to shut up – and go play with their silly cartoons. Obama at the UN last week said their priorities are now Iran and taking another shot at solving the Israeli-Palestinian tragedy. So the ball is really in Obama's court – not the sociopath's.

With just a couple of days to go before the culmination of the Ashuraa observances on Saturday, the holy city of Karbala is already packed with Shi'ite pilgrims, and even more are expected to arrive. Increased Iraqi troops were ordered to the area for security purposes, while curfews are in effect elsewhere. Unsurprisingly though, attacks against Shi'ite Muslims have increased this week, particularly in Diyala province. Overall, 41 Iraqis were killed and 40 were wounded in the latest attacks.
A explosives-laden suicide bomber killed 11 people and wounded another 15 at a Shi'ite mosque in Baquba.
A car bomb outside a Mosul church wounded a police officer and a woman. A police officer was gunned down in a separate incident. Downtown, a civilian was also killed; they were a member of a human rights group. Also, an empty primary school was bombed, but no casualties were reported.
During clashed in Shurqat, two police officers and two gunmen were killed.
In Baghdad, three unidentified bodies were recovered. A lack of news stories from the capital is likely due to curfews and other security measures.
In Sulaiman Bek, a gunman rigging a car bomb managed to only kill themselves with it.
One police officer and four civilians were wounded during a bombing in Tikrit. Meanwhile, gunmen killed a police officer and wounded two bodyguards in a separate incident.
In Bishkan, Awakening Council members and gunmen clashed, leaving six dead gunmen and another 13 wounded.
Iraqi authorities fired 173 Basra police officers because of crime allegations. Also, a sheikh escaped an assassination attempt. South of town, one police officer was killed and another was wounded during a shooting near the Ibn al-Jawzi shrine.
A police officer was killed during clashes in an unspecified location in Salah ad Din province.
U.S. forces, including ground and air troops, killed three suspects during a raid in Jalawla. When troops entered the building they found two dead and two injured women. Nearby, a man who ignored orders was killed as they exited a building.
U.S. forces killed three suspects in Muqdadiyah and detained nine across central and northern Iraq. A kidnapping trio was arrested in Kut. Two suspects were killed in Bi'aj.
Also, the Iraqi Army took over security of the main highway between Baghdad and Baquba. This stretch of road has been the scene of numerous attacks.

Peter Skyllberg, a 44-year-old man from Sweden, survived two months trapped in their snow-covered car due to a "natural igloo" that formed from the air trapped in the vehicle, the Telegraph reports.
In a stroke of luck, a passerby found Skyllberg in their car in Umea, a town a little south of the Arctic Circle, where the Telegraph reports authorities say they were in "really bad shape." They were immediately taken to a nearby hospital, where they are expected to be released in a few days after a full recovery. The temperature in the area had reportedly dropped to -30 C.
Doctor Ulf Segerberg, the Chief Medical Officer at Norrland's University Hospital told the paper in a separate report that, combined with the igloo effect, it's not unheard of a human to survive without food for that long.
"Starvation for one month, anyone can tolerate that if they have water to drink," Segerberg told the Telegraph. "If you have body fat, you will survive even longer, although you end up looking like someone coming from a concentration camp."
The BBC reports that one doctor told the Swedish Vasterbotten Courier that Skyllberg survived by going into a "kind of hibernation."
Segerberg recognized that Skyllberg's survival was against the odds, the Telegraph reports.
"This is a case in a lifetime. Every winter we have people who have frozen to death. But a case like this, with someone caught outside for such a long time, is very rare, because it's very rare that you are not missed by anyone, which seems to be the case in this instance."
CERN Finds “Significant” Cosmic Ray Cloud Effect
Best known for its studies of the fundamental constituents of matter, the CERN particle-physics laboratory in Geneva is now also being used to study the climate. Researchers in the CLOUD collaboration have released the first results from their experiment designed to mimic conditions in the Earth's atmosphere. By firing beams of particles from the lab's Proton Synchrotron accelerator into a gas-filled chamber, they have discovered that cosmic rays could have a role to play in climate by enhancing the production of potentially cloud-seeding aerosols. —Physics World, 24 August 2011
If Henrik Svensmark is right, then we are going down the wrong path of taking all these expensive measures to cut carbon emissions; if they are right, we could carry on with carbon emissions as normal.–Terry Sloan, BBC News 3 April 2008
Henrik Svensmark welcomes the new results, claiming that they confirm research carried out by their own group, including a study published earlier this year showing how an electron beam enhanced production of clusters inside a cloud chamber. They acknowledge that the link between cosmic rays and cloud formation will not be proved until aerosols that are large enough to act as condensation surfaces are studied in the lab, but believes that their group has already found strong evidence for the link in the form of significant negative correlations between cloud cover and solar storms. Physics World, 24 August 2011
CERN's CLOUD experiment is designed to study the formation of clouds and the idea that Cosmic Rays may have an influence. The take-home message from this research is that we just don't understand clouds in anything other than hand-waving terms. We also understand the effects of aerosols even less. The other things to come out of it are that trace constituencies in the atmosphere seem to have a big effect on cloud formation, and that Cosmic rays also have an effect, a “significant” one according to CERN. –David Whitehouse, The Observatory, 25 August 2011
I have asked the CERN colleagues to present the results clearly, but not to interpret them. That would go immediately into the highly political arena of the climate change debate. One has to make clear that cosmic radiation is only one of many parameters. –Rolf-Dieter Heuer, Director General of CERN, Welt Online 15 July 2011
Although they never said so, the High Priests of the Inconvenient Truth – in such temples as NASA-GISS, Penn State and the University of East Anglia – always knew that Svensmark's cosmic ray hypothesis was the principal threat to their sketchy and poorly modelled notions of self-amplifying action of greenhouse gases. In telling how the obviously large influences of the Sun in previous centuries and millennia could be explained, and in applying the same mechanism to the 20th warming, Svensmark put the alarmist predictions at risk – and with them the billions of dollars flowing from anxious governments into the global warming enterprise. –-Nigel Calder, 24 August 2011
Jasper Kirkby is a superb scientist, but they have been a lousy politician. In 1998, anticipating he'd be leading a path-breaking experiment into the sun's role in global warming, they made the mistake of stating that the sun and cosmic rays “will probably be able to account for somewhere between a half and the whole of the increase in the Earth's temperature that we have seen in the last century.” Global warming, they theorized, may be part of a natural cycle in the Earth's temperature. Dr. Kirkby was immediately condemned by climate scientists for minimizing the role of human beings in global warming. Stories in the media disparaged Dr. Kirkby by citing scientists who feared oil-industry lobbyists would use their statements to discredit the greenhouse effect. And the funding approval for Dr. Kirkby's path-breaking experiment — seemingly a sure thing when they first announced their proposal– was put on ice. –Lawrence Solomon, National Post, 23 Feb 2007

Roberto Di Matteo admits they did not expect Chelsea to produce a scintillating display against Queens Park Rangers on the back of their European heroics.
Tuesday's 10-man effort against Barcelona offered big rewards - a place in the UEFA Champions League final - but it took a lot out of the Blues.
There were, however, no signs of tiredness as they swept aside capital rivals QPR at Stamford Bridge on Sunday.
A revitalised Fernando Torres led the derby charge, as they netted a hat-trick, and Chelsea ended up running out 6-1 winners to close to within a point of the Premier League's top four.
"I have to be honest, after the midweek Champions League game, sometimes it is very difficult to re-focus," Di Matteo told Sky Sports.
"But the players did extremely well today to focus on this Premier League game and I have to say that they surprised me.
"We played well today. We played some good football. We scored goals and we were after three points so we are pleased with the way we got them."

Di Matteo shuffled their pack on Sunday in an effort to try and aid Chelsea's trophy quest - with the Blues also safely through to next weekend's FA Cup final - and was delighted to see those drafted in perform at such a high level.
Torres was among those handed a starting berth and their showing drew deserved praise from a man who has never lost faith in the Spaniard's ability.
"He deserves all the credit," said Di Matteo.
"He has been working hard and the goals don't always come. I was always pleased with their attitude and work-rate and it's pleasing to see the strikers score for us."
Di Matteo was also quick to salute the performance of club captain John Terry following their reckless red card at Camp Nou.
They said: "He is our leader. I said this after the Barcelona game and again today they showed the leadership that they have.
"We had an unusual back four today and they really led the team. They were outstanding."
A Downey woman who spent their life mothering children who had no one else to turn to was on the receiving end of a tremendous gift on Wednesday.
Alena Strickland fostered more than 200 children over the years, many of them with mental, emotional and physical disabilities.
It all began 27 years ago, when Strickland's infant daughter, Jamie, was hospitalized.
At the hospital, Strickland saw an abandoned baby that was terminally ill. Strickland arraigned to take the infant home so the child would not have to die alone.
Strickland, who has three biological children, adopted 14 of their foster children.
On Wednesday, Strickland received a $50,000 award from “5-hour ENERGY Helps To amaze People.”
Strickland said they planned to use the money to start an elementary school at the Dream Center in Los Angeles for homeless children in the area.

A UK debate over whether to leave the European Union (EU) is drawing in academics from across the continent. Millions in research funding, collaborations and the employment status of thousands of scientists could be affected by the outcome. The UK government has committed to holding a referendum on a Brexit — as the possible British exit has been dubbed — by the end of 2017.
Brexit proponents say that a lone United Kingdom would enjoy greater freedom to set policies that affect research. But most researchers who are willing to pick a side publicly are worried about the prospect. “Europe would suffer and the UK would suffer,” says Lesley Wilson, secretary-general of the European University Association in Brussels.
One big uncertainty is money. UK universities rely on the EU for around 16% of their total research funding. And scientists working in the United Kingdom are disproportionately successful at winning such awards compared to applicants in other member states; under the EU's last Framework Programme, which ran from 2007 to 2013, they won grants worth €7 billion (US$7.58 billion), second in value only to Germany. UK institutions also host more researchers with grants from the EU-funded European Research Council (ERC) than those in any other member state.
Being outside the EU does not necessarily preclude involvement in EU programmes. Non-members such as Norway, Switzerland and Israel have gained access to various EU research schemes, mainly by paying for inclusion in them and by adopting some general EU rules, such as freedom of movement.
Angus Dalgleish, who is part of the ‘Leave.eu' campaign, says that the shortfall would be made up if the United Kingdom were to redirect to science even a portion of the sum — most recently around €17 billion — that it must contribute annually to the overall budget of the EU as a member. “We would have a far bigger budget for funding our own science,” says Dalgleish, a cancer and HIV researcher at St George's, University of London, who once stood for election as a member of the pro-Brexit UK Independence Party.
But opponents of a Brexit counter that the United Kingdom could find it expensive to renegotiate entry into EU funding programmes because of its historically outsized success at winning competitive grants. They also cite the example of Switzerland, which had bought into EU funding schemes but was booted out of many such projects in 2014 after its citizens voted to restrict immigration. Scientists had to scramble to find ways around the official severing of ties after that, and Swiss participation has been restricted ever since.
UK researchers could still access major EU research-infrastructure projects after a Brexit. But they would lose the priority given to EU members, putting them at the back of the queue for access to facilities ranging from a laser instrument to a major social-science data set. UK researchers would also have to negotiate for access to international projects where EU funding currently gets them in, such as the huge experimental fusion reactor, ITER.
Bridges burned
For Kurt Deketelaere, secretary-general of the League of European Research Universities in Leuven, Belgium, the potential loss of mobility and collaboration is worrying for scientists across Europe. Wilson agrees. “Everybody wants to work with the best,” they say. “If you're going to lose strong partners, that's not going to benefit anybody.” Dalgleish counters that universities already maintain successful collaborations with non-EU members, and says that opting out would have “no negative impact on scientific collaboration whatsoever”.
Still, around 15% of academic staff at UK institutions are non-UK EU nationals, a figure that rises to 20% among elite universities. It is unlikely that these people would have to apply for visas or leave in the event of a Brexit, or that grants already awarded would be clawed back. But in future, obtaining funding and securing jobs across UK–EU borders could become more difficult. “In general, the UK would be less attractive for me,” says Yvonne Peters, a particle physicist originally from Germany who works at the University of Manchester, UK, and is partially funded by a grant from the ERC.
Brexit proponents say that if the United Kingdom leaves, it will escape other EU regulations, such as rules governing clinical trials. These have been widely blamed for hindering UK medical research — triggering proposals to overhaul the regulations. The nation might also be able to offer more tax credits for research spending and adopt a more positive stance on genetically modified crops.
But the EU would also lose a powerful political voice pushing for science, says Vicky Ford, a UK Conservative Party member of the European Parliament who supports EU reform. They say that UK votes have been crucial in parliamentary decisions that have affected the entire bloc, including reductions to red tape in the awarding of funds, and improvements to science-advice mechanisms in EU politics. Without UK votes, Ford says, EU research would have paid a price: “Definitely there would have been less money.”
Over the past two practices the Winnipeg Jets' coach Paul Maurice has tried something a little bit different: Jacob Trouba has been removed from their natural right-side to the left of Dustin Byfuglien, and away from Mark Stuart.
There are some indications that this is move in the right direction for the Jets, but also that there is one step further the Jets could take as well.
Let's take a look.
Jacob Trouba deserves more ice time
The Jets pretty consistently use whichever pair carries Dustin Byfulgien as their top defensive pair, and for good measure. The other two pairs are a bit less consistent in which one is given the second most minutes. More-often-than-not though, Trouba is situated on the third.
Graphic courtesy of hockeyviz.com
To say Trouba has been deployed as a third pair defender would be a misnomer though. At 20.29 minutes per game, and 15.88 for 5-on-5 situations, Trouba sits third overall for the Jets ice time allocation. Trouba usually earns extra minutes getting double shifted with either Tyler Myers or Byfuglien during high-leverage situations, like the final minutes of a period.
Despite garnering top minutes, Trouba's ice time has fallen significantly from their previous two seasons. Both Tobias Enstrom and Myers have seen a drop in their usage as well. While part comes from the Jets playing a tonne of short handed minutes, the Jets have seen an appreciation of minutes with either Ben Chiarot, Adam Pardy, or Mark Stuart on the ice.
This is not optimal. You want to play your best on the ice for as much as possible.
Steve Burtch's dCorsi looks at a player's shot differential for all shots (goals, saves, misses, blocks) relative to what one would expect given skater's with factors such as zone starts, line matching, and line mates. The top-four Jet defenders by this metric have unsurprisingly been Byfuglien, Trouba, Enstrom, and Myers (in that order), with only the first three being in the positives.
These are the four you want on the ice more as they are the ones (well three out of four) out performing their usage and can take a large share of the workload.
Mark Stuart is an anchor
Trouba has spent most of their ice time in the NHL playing with Mark Stuart as their defensive partner. In fact, Trouba has played 1860 of their 2637 minutes with Stuart on the ice.
While it is admirable the amount of effort Stuart gives consistently every game, and no one could dismiss how willingly they will sacrifice themselves to help the team, Stuart has a history of making their linemates perform worse.
Numbers courtesy of stats.hockeyanalysis.com and skaters are ordered in most to the least minutes with Stuart since the 2011-12 season. Byfuglien ice time includes minutes as forward and defender, while Bogosian minutes away include some of 2014-2015 season with the Buffalo Sabres.
Almost as consistently as Stuart “works hard”, the blue liner constantly finds their defensive partners out shot worse when skating beside them than away, and in the long run this means out scored given a large enough sample.
The Jets' General Manager, Kevin Cheveldayoff, has some enormous decisions looming over the near horizon. The Jets have multiple contracts expiring with some big names looking for raises: Byfuglien, Andrew Ladd, Mark Scheifele, and Trouba as well. One reason why the Jets would want to thrust Trouba into a larger role is to see what they are made of and worth, or even their ability to replace Byfuglien if the need arises.
Now this situation is a bit of a catch-22. The Jets wish to see how Trouba performs away from Stuart to see how much they are willing to invest in him, yet at the same time giving them those minutes will likely improve their outcomes, increase their merits, and raise their value.
Trouba-Byfuglien have been really good together
For the most part this season, the Jets have rarely carried two pairs at the same time performing well.
Graphic courtesy of hockeyviz.com. Click here to expand image.
The graphic above displays the Jets defensive individuals and pairs performance in shot rates for and against, where top right is optimal.
The best big minutes defensive pair has been Enstrom and Byfuglien. This makes sense as it's the Jets best left-shot defender with the Jets best right-shot defender. However, Trouba and Byfuglien have been even better.
The sample is small with only 67 minutes of ice time together. One would not expect that level of success to be sustainable and it is likely that the situational environments the two have played in have been beneficial to their results as well, due to playing together mostly in late-game, trailing minutes where score-effects peak in impact.
Still, despite all the factors that may make the results inflated, the mere fact that the results have been so exceptional is promising.
They are also two exceptionally skilled defenders so success is not all that surprising and should be expected over the long run. Matt Cane of Hockey-Graphs and Puck++ showed that the average defender should see their Corsi percentage drop about 1.39 percentage points when moving to their off-handed side. The difference in skill level between Byfuglien and Stuart or Trouba and Chiarot is well above that difference.
The next step forward is with Paul Postma
There is a potential issue though with the currently devised set up: the Jets will now dress Stuart and Chiarot together. Both players have been struggling this season and their functionality and effectiveness is limited. Neither are adept puck movers and there is a real danger to the two getting exploited, especially on the road.
The solution is Paul Postma.
Postma was dressed for two games this season. In those two games Postma ended up on the ice for two goals against, and was promptly sent back to the pressbox. The thing is though that it's not a trend we should expect to persist.
While Postma was on the ice, the Jets directed 21 shots at their opponent's net while they only allowed 7. Of the 7 five ended up on goal, and of the 5 two went in the net. Postma was outscored due to their netminder posting a 0.600 save percentage while the other being perfect.
Now some may then point to shot quality. DTM About Heart at Hockey-Graphs devised Expected Goals, a Corsi based statistic where shots are weighted by shot quality factors such as the shooter's history, angle, distance, handedness, and whether the shot is from sustained pressure, rush, or rebound. This algorithm that includes shot quality indicates that more-often-than-note Paul Postma outscores their opposition given the shots that occurred.
This isn't new. Postma has a history of crushing soft minutes on the third pair. Over their career as a Jet, the Jets have a 52.5 per cent Corsi with Postma on the ice. The Jets also control 52.9 per cent of scoring chances and 54.9 per cent of high-danger scoring chances according to war-on-ice. These results place Postma in the top quartile for third-pair defenders.
Postma has garnered those impressive results while playing over 50% of their time with Pardy and Stuart. Their best results came while they were with Pardy, although the chances of Maurice sitting Stuart is slim-to-none.
The largest detraction to Postma is their inability (at least in usage, as effectiveness is unknown) to kill penalties. It should be noted thought that Byfuglien, Myers, Enstrom, and Trouba (ordered from best to worst) have all had varying levels of success on the penalty kill, enough to handle the minutes and enough to do it better than Stuart (who is one of the league's worst penalty killers).
Postma is flawed and imperfect, but that is the norm for a third-pair defender. The goal though is to get the least flawed ones and skew the odds of outscoring the opposition in your favour.
Closing thoughts
The Jets are pushing Trouba into a more traditional top-four role, where they will gather most of their minutes while playing with another top-four defender. This is a good thing for Trouba, and it should be a good thing for the Jets.
There is the risk though that the third-par may get overly exploited with two inept puck movers together in Stuart and Chiarot. The solution to that is Postma.

Remember when Sen. Mark Warner (D-Va.) was one of only a handful of Senate Democrats not to sign a letter calling on the NFL to urge the Redskins to change its name? Warner's office told The Washington Post in May, “it's not for Congress to dictate what the league does.”
Warner, of course, represents the state where the Redskins practice, and Virginia's second senator Tim Kaine (D) also did not sign the letter. It's a sensitive issue politically to represent diehard fans who may not want the name changed while acknowledging that many consider it a racial slur.
But in classic Washington fashion, two lobbyists for the Redskins listed on disclosure forms are former Warner aides. In June, the Redskins hired McGuireWoods Consulting to represent them a week after 50 senators sent the letter to the NFL. The firm, in its disclosure, says its mission includes discussing “team origins, history and traditions.”
That lobbyists Andrew Smith and Heather Martin both worked for Warner was spotted by Legistorm, which keeps an extensive database of congressional staff.
Smith worked on Warner's 2008 Senate campaign and then in their congressional office as assistant to the chief of staff for most of 2009 before moving to Warner's leadership PAC as a director, according to Legistorm data. Martin worked on Warner's gubernatorial PAC, One Virginia, as a director in 2002-2003.
Smith is well past the one-year cooling-off period between working on the Hill and lobbying their former office, so they can directly contact Warner.
The revolving door in this town is dizzying.
UPDATE: Kaine's office wanted us to point out that they support changing the Redskins's name, but did not sign the senators' letter because of tone. In a June 22 letter to the editor published in the Virginian-Pilot, Kaine wrote, “The name, chosen in a different era, is offensive by today's standards, and I encourage the team's ownership to make an enlightened decision to change it.”
Managing Director of Abadan Oil Refinery Company Esfandiar Daemolzekr informed reportes about the latest development status of and the plan to reduce fuel oil production in the oldest oil refinery of the Middle East saying “in partnership with China's Sinopec, the plan to equip, develop and upgrade Abadan refinery will kick off as of the new Iranian calendar year (to begin March 21).”
The official recalled that the second development contract was inked with the Chinese side following implementation of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) asserting “the initiative aims to boost profitability and reduce fuel oil production form the current 40% to less than 20 per cent.”
They emphasized that the refinery project required three billion dollars of investment adding “desalination units and those for purification of diesel and kerosene will be also expanded.”
On the third development phase of Abadan refinery, Daemolzekr said about 40 per cent of crude oil is currently turned into fuel oil due to ageing distillation units though reduction of fuel oil output has been put on the agenda.
They underlined that 8000 jobs will be created during five years of developing phase two of the Iranian refinery highlighting that for expansion of Abadan complex phase 4, talks are underway with a Japanese firm and a contract will be inked soon.
They referred to the held negotiations with Japan's JGC JGC Corporation Engineering company for carrying out the fourth development phase of Abadan Oil Refinery maintaining “the project will require nearly two billion euros of financing and it will reduce fuel oil output to less than 10 per cent.”
The official at National Iranian Oil Refining and Distribution Company (NIORDC) went on to stress that Abadan Oil Refinery began operation about 107 years ago with an initial output of 2700 barrels though its production figure has fluctuated over years.
“The refinery is currently supplying 25 per cent of the country's gasoline demand,” noted Daemolzekr concluding “Abadan Oil Refinery is presently yielding seven million liters of Euro-4 gasoline and 100LL avgas per day.”

JERUSALEM (Ma'an) -- Israeli forces announced on Monday a series of closures and heightened security operations throughout the occupied West Bank, East Jerusalem, and the larger Jerusalem district in anticipation of the Jewish holiday of Yom Kippur, according to Israeli police.
Israeli Police spokesperson Luba al-Samri said in a statement Monday that Israeli police, border police, and Israeli “volunteers” would be spread through different areas in the city of Jerusalem beginning early Tuesday morning, the beginning of Yom Kippur, to “maintain order and provide protection for Jews expected to arrive to the Western Wall for prayer.”
Al-Samri added that Israeli police provided the volunteers with weapons to “guarantee the safety of the worshipers.”
The Jaffa Gate entrance to the Old City was closed to tourists and private cars on Tuesday, only permitting residents of the Old City to enter.
“Israeli police in cooperation with the Jerusalem municipality will install checkpoints at the main roads to prevent cars of Eastern residents from heading to West Jerusalem,” al-Samri said in their statement, referring to preventing the access of any Palestinian residents of East Jerusalem to West Jerusalem.
“Israeli police will also be stationed at neighborhoods to prevent any rock throwing.”
“Israeli police also calls upon the public to contact the police for emergencies and if they suspect someone or something,” the statement concluded.
In a separate statement, Israeli police said it would be imposing a “complete closure” on the West Bank ahead of Yom Kippur, meaning all border crossings between the West Bank and Israel, the West Bank and Jordan, and Israel and the Gaza Strip would be closed.
The statement added that the closure started Monday at midnight and would go on until midnight Wednesday, and that Israeli authorities would only allow medical crews, doctors and urgent humanitarian cases to pass, so as long as they had an authorization from the Israeli government.
The extensive closures and intensified security announcements came in the wake of a deadly shooting in the East Jerusalem neighborhood of Sheikh Jarrah Sunday morning, that left the Palestinian attacker and two Israelis dead.
Following the attack, Israeli forces carried out a massive detention campaign across the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem, detaining at least 56 Palestinians in overnight raids, with more than two thirds of the detainees coming from the Jerusalem area
Their actions have been condemned by rights groups, who have said the measures amount to “court-sanctioned revenge,” and represent a clear violation of international law.
Israeli authorities have come under repeated criticism for carrying out large scale detention raids, limiting the freedom of mobility of Palestinians, and punitive home demolitions -- what many human rights organizations have called “collective punishment” -- in response to such attacks.
THE AFL is investigating an incident involving Collingwood's Alex Fasolo in Friday night's NAB Challenge clash with Geelong.
The broadcaster's cameras appeared to capture vision of Fasolo urinating into a cup on the interchange bench in the second quarter of the match.
It is understood the League will take several factors into consideration before determining an outcome.
The Magpies' change rooms are located on the other side of the ground to the bench, meaning Fasolo would have had to have walked around the playing arena to use the toilet.
Even with the renovations being conducted at Simonds Stadium, only Geelong's home rooms are located on the same side of the ground as the interchange bench.
However, the away team has access to Geelong's VFL rooms, which are located in the left forward pocket at the city end of the ground.
Even with the ongoing redevelopment, those facilities were available if needed. But it's believed Collingwood was unaware if it was able to use those rooms or not.
Based on the available vision Fasolo also appeared to do everything possible to be discreet, using a towel to cover themselves up.
Former Hawthorn forward Mark Williams was reported for misconduct in 2008, under AFL law 19.2.2, after relieving themselves before the start of a VFL match.
Fasolo was one of Collingwood's best players against the Cats, booting a game-high five goals to go with 19 disposals and seven marks.
The AFL is expected to announce a verdict into the inquiry late on Monday or early on Tuesday morning.

The Mushrooms of Autumn: Blewits
Much as I love Blewits, one of the greatest wild mushrooms of any season, I've never gotten around to doing more than throwing in a mention when talking about fall bulb planting. This omission is now remedied. Our resident wild mushroom expert explains all in
BLEWITS AND THE LEAF-FALL
by Bill Bakaitis
In the Northeast autumn leaves start to fall shortly after the equinox. This colorful event takes over a month and a half to complete, during which time the fungi of the forest floor will become increasingly difficult to see. If you are after fall mushrooms you will want to get out now, before they are completely hidden by this new leaf fall.
In a good year, like this one, autumn will begin with a tropical storm. The organic matter from the previous fall which has lain crisp and dry under the summer's heat will revive becoming soft, moist and fragrant. In the days after the storm the air will hang hush and humid, languid with the last hot breath of summer.
In this heat and humidity the duff underfoot will come to life. The mycelium of saprophytic fungi will fill with fluid and their primordials will swell and a chaotic profusion of mushroom will appear like magic, often overnight, (and often with their own overlay of other fungi which are feeding on them). The problem for collectors at this time of year is often to restrict our search for a few ‘choice' species. For many this means Blewits.
Blewits (Lepista nuda or Clitocybe nuda) are among the most tasty of fall mushrooms and are on nearly everyone's “must collect” list. There is but one confusing look-alike (see below). If Blewits are new to you, click here for more on identifying them:
Blewits fruit in profusion, field-dress easily, and keep quite well. They are firm in texture, retaining this firmness under various cooking techniques, and have a delightfully light anise fragrance about them, a quality I like to exploit by incorporating just a drop of Pernod somewhere into the cooking process. Leslie may want to add a recipe of their own, but in the meantime you may also see Louise Freeman's suggestions here.
Where, when and how to find Blewits:
Blewits make their living by decomposing leaf litter. They are more or less ubiquitous, appearing here and there under a wide variety of habitats, in both deciduous and evergreen duff as well as in weedy accumulation of herbaceous plants. I have found them from June through the following January in the Mid-Hudson area of New York State, but by far fall is the best time to look for them.
Although they are cosmopolitan, to find them in quantity one should look to places where leaf matter accumulates. In the forest, for example, there will be places where leaves naturally collect from the action of wind and gravity. Depressions or dips in the landscape, the bottom of a steep hillside, a hedge of bramble, or the branchy top of a downed tree are areas which can collect windblown leaves and can be very productive.
You will also want to look in areas of manmade litter accumulations: places, for example, where cemeteries, parks, road crews, gardeners or homeowners have piled leaves. So long as no toxic chemicals have been discarded with the debris, the Blewits collected from this leaf mold will be as safe as those coming from natural wind drifts.
Leslie and I found one such area last October. Several rain storms had recently passed through, drenching the area. We were making one of our several seasonal trips between Maine and New York in a car crammed with tropical plants destined for the greenhouse and basement of our winter home.
On a secondary road, and in need of stretching our legs, we spotted a quiet cul de sac and decided to investigate the grassy area and surrounding forest for whatever nature had to offer. I made a small technical collection of Amanita and Leccinum under some Oaks on the grassy slope then plunged over a very steep bank into a deciduous forest.
Only two steps off the grass I was knee deep in fresh leaf litter. Moving to the bottom of the hill we found compacted older litter next to a small stream and where the stream curved an area the size of a large barnyard was filled with bushels of Blewits. Those poking up above the leaves caught our attention first, but as we knelt down to pick them we could feel others under foot, under knee, and under hand. We picked a quick peck and then, with a great deal of laughter, faced the problem of where and how to put them in our already overstuffed car. As they say, it's a tough job…
Grow your own Blewits:
Here is a tip worth remembering. The next time you find a fresh collection of Blewits take a plastic grocery bag and into it stuff several hands full of the leaf-mold (mushrooms included) in which the Blewits are growing. This will be your ‘seed'. In it you will see the white fluffy mycelium attached to the base of the Blewits. This is the part of the mushroom which is digesting the litter and is the essential material with which you can inoculate your own pile of leaves.
Keep this innoculant moist, but not sealed in the bag. When you get home place it under an edge of your pile of leaves. I like to scrape an area of soil and place the inoculant here, between the dirt and the leaves. It is important not to place the introduced material in the middle of a pile of fresh leaves as the pile can heat up, cook and kill your innoculent.
An alternative, and only slightly less effective technique is to simply throw your old Blewits onto a leaf pile. In my experience, about one in three or four piles inoculated in this manner seem to ‘take'.
You may want to water the leaf pile next summer if drought conditions occur, but once established your Blewit patch can produce throughout the season.
One note of caution deserves mentioning. Other ‘weed species' are also likely to come up with your Blewits, so discriminate collection is essential. If you do not already have one, get a good field guide and know how to use it. Or, as mentioned in previous posts, join a local Mycological Association and get to know your local flora.
Learn to recognize Cortinarius alboviolaceus, a Blewit look-alike
By far the most confusing mushroom beginners will encounter when collecting Lepista nuda will be the Cortinarius alboviolaceus complex. (For more on this mushroom click here.
Although once considered ‘edible' all Cortinarii are now thought to contain toxins and should be avoided. Cortinarius is a very large genus, with perhaps as many as a thousand species thought to occur in North America. There is no complete monograph and it is estimated that only half of the species have been described. I have seen a dozen or so names used for mushrooms in the alboviolaceus complex. No matter what the name used, this is a mushroom that should not be eaten.
Blewits and C. alboviolaceus resemble each other in that they both have a bulbous fleshy stem and violet colors throughout. They look alike. Beyond this however there are several distinctive differences that a trained eye can detect.
The cap of Lepista for example, will typically look soft and moist; while that of alboviolaceus will have more of a dry, fibrous, silvery sheen.
The habitats may be overlap, but Corts are mycorrhizal, forming a symbiotic relationship with ectomycorrhizal trees. They may come up through leaves, but do not feed on them as Lepista does.
One quite noticeable difference is that a young alboviolaceus will have a distinctive spider-web like cortina (curtain) under the cap and covering the gills. Lepista will have a clean stem from the beginning.
Like all Corts, alboviolaceus will produce a rusty-brown spore print. Lepista nuda will produce a pinkish-buff to lavender spore print. In mature Corts, the spores can often be seen collected on the collapsed cortina as a rusty-brown powder.
And finally, many collectors report that while members of the alboviolaceus complex develop a musty odor quite early in their maturational process, the developing Blewit retains a light fragrance well into old age. And this pleasing fragrance is, after all, one of the prime characteristics of this choice mushroom. Try some this fall and start your own Victory Garden for next year.
With SWELL entering Day 3, I thought it might be wise to take a moment and provide some information to those investors who might be approaching the idea of adding a crypto-currency to their portfolio for the first time!
Bankers, traditional investors, and others that may have attended SWELL or even heard about XRP and Ripple through the grapevine at SIBOS might have been prompted to do some homework. Regardless of the decision by their employer to use Ripple technology, they may be interested in investing in XRP for their own investment portfolio.
For their sake, let's start at the beginning!
So You're Curious About Purchasing Some XRP?
Well you are definitely not alone! The number of active XRP wallets broke 500,0001 recently; a benchmark that reflects widespread and growing interest in XRP as an investment.
This investment is intriguing.
The latest news from Ripple is almost too long to list in a bullet-point fashion; but of course that won't stop me from selecting some of my favorite highlights:
SWELL Conference #1 2
Ripple collaborates with the Gates' Foundation 3
XRP Supply Escrow Lock-up (Pending by end-of-year) 4
First Use of xRapid – Ripple's liquidity solution using XRP 5
Ripple's banking and financial customers number over 100 6
Ripple opens new offices in India and Singapore 7 8
Ripple's Cross-Border Entry for Faster Payments Task Force praised by McKinsey 9
Ripple demonstrates ILP live, sending transaction to seven different ledgers 10
BitGo Enterprise Wallet for XRP available for banks and other businesses 11
Ripple meets with China's central bank 12
CGI Conducts 360-member survey pointing to use of “Shared ledgers e.g. Ripple”13
Those knowledgeable about Ripple and XRP are probably identifying some of their own favorite news items that didn't make it in my above list, but my point is this: in addition to being a store of value like Bitcoin, XRP has a use case, and it is super-massive.
The cross-border payments space has payment volume that is measured in the quadrillions14; and it uses outdated technology that is ripe for replacement.
If you are already interested in purchasing XRP, I won't spend any time talking about XRP's utility as a bridge asset for exchanging value across border – you probably know about that already. Instead, let's cut to the chase and talk about XRP and where you can get some.
Where and how do I purchase XRP?
Where should you purchase XRP? The official Ripple website stays generic about this, so they're not going to give you much down-to-earth advice tailored to your own circumstances. But their official listing of some exchanges is worth a look: https://ripple.com/xrp/buy-xrp/ Keep in mind that Ripple's listing is incomplete, as the actual number of worldwide exchanges that offer XRP has now climbed to 3315, not the subset of 17 that they list.
Factors to Consider
Instead of providing you with my own personal list of preferred exchanges, I would instead advise you to tailor your choice based on the answers to some basic questions. Once these questions are answered, you'll have a better idea what to look for before making a decision on where to buy.
How would you rate your own technical prowess?
Are you a long-term or short-term investor?
How much XRP are you looking to purchase?
Does the withdrawal limit for the exchange pose any issues for you?
Are you looking for an exchange with strong secondary authentication?
Do you prefer an exchange based in your own country?
Are there any crypto trade restrictions based on where you live?
Are you looking for direct fiat-to-XRP support, or are you okay with BTC-to-XRP trading?
Is the trade volume of the exchange important to you?
The answers to each of these questions impact which exchange might be better suited to your needs.
Generally speaking, if somebody is technically astute, I feel more comfortable advising them to tailor their choices based on the full list; however, if they're just looking for a good long-term investment in a new technology, then it's good to “keep it simple” if possible.
Continuing along these lines, if the person is a casual investor, I'd advise them to choose a reputable online exchange that has had no previous security issues where users have had their funds stolen. A good online exchange will then be able to guide them through the KYC (know your customer) process or other authentication procedures.
XRPChat Poll: Recommended Exchange for New XRP Investors
I conducted a poll on XRPChat to determine which exchange that the community recommends for new XRP investors. The winner was Bitstamp. Bitstamp's official site: https://www.bitstamp.net/
Note that this survey only targeted users of XRPChat, and posters and readers there tend to be already knowledgeable about where to buy XRP. However, my goal was to arrive at a community consensus: The question I asked in the survey pertained to what they would recommend for a new XRP investor.
Local Wallet
Once the new user has chosen an exchange, I'd advise them to activate secondary authentication using authentication software. Note: I do not advise using instant messaging as a secondary authentication mechanism, as this technique has shown to be vulnerable to hacking techniques. 16
For most causal or long-term investors, storing a small amount of XRP on an exchange should be an acceptable approach.
But what about large-scale investors or investors who want to purchase a material amount of XRP compared to their total investment portfolio? Let's continue our thought exercise of what we would recommend to a new user for a local wallet.
If you are a bank: Ripple has contracted with BitGo to provide an enterprise wallet. BitGo doesn't have a generic download option for the public – banks must contact BitGo: https://www.bitgo.com/contact
If you are an individual looking for a wallet to locally manage your access to XRP, then there are multiple options.
XRPChat Poll: Recommended Local Wallet for New XRP Investors
To keep on track with how to advise a new XRP investor, I conducted another poll on XRPChat regarding which local wallet forum members recommend. The result was clear – the most popular local wallet option was the Ledger Nano: https://www.ledgerwallet.com/
The other two options are worth mentioning, however, since they were also both popular in my two-step poll to determine the consensus wallet recommendation. Those two are:
Rippex Desktop Wallet: https://rippex.net/carteira-ripple.php#/
Toast Wallet: https://toastwallet.com/
Note: Ripple doesn't endorse any local wallet, and they've only partnered with BitGo, since their primary type of customer is banks and financial institutions, not retail investors. However, there have been indications that more wallet options might be in the works from BitGo and other Ripple partners.
Stay tuned for more local wallet options in the near future.
News and Research
If you're a new XRP owner, join the club! The trade volume of XRP was recently clocked at over one billion dollars per day17 during the SWELL conference, and many alt coin traders and investors have been doing research and liking what they find.
For those that are new to XRP and want to learn more by asking the kind of probing questions that go beyond marketing material, the next step should be to seek out various forums that meet their needs.
I'm a long-term XRP investor, and I truly believe in the company and in XRP; however, I know very well that the XRP community is also comprised of short-term traders and even alt-coin day traders, so the resources for research will necessarily have a different focus.
Here's my breakdown:
XRP Day traders: Stick to Discord and Twitter. You're going to be frustrated otherwise. Here is a good English-speaking XRP Discord group: Discord Invitation Please note that Discord operates by invitation only, so you may have to request a new one if this one expires or is otherwise disabled. If this invitation has expired, please navigate to XRPChat and send me a personal message; I can connect you with the owner of this Discord for an invitation. Other than Discord, paying attention to a Twitter feed will sometimes yield high-velocity information that you might be able to use.
A useful Twitter feed for day traders is something of an art, but if you're new to XRP, I can tell you that my basic recommendation is to follow the official company tweets: https://twitter.com/Ripple This is the Twitter account that announced the countdown to the SWELL conference that resulted in a surge of XRP volume.
XRP Swing Traders: Combination of Twitter, Discord, Reddit and XRPChat.
Reddit has a lot of up-to-date information for swing traders that are looking for trend analysis and sharing of links to outside articles. It's interface is geared towards the sharing of external information and the conversations that directly follow, which may provide insights that short-term traders can use to their advantage. Although there is more than one Reddit group that discusses XRP topics, the one with the most users is this one: r/Ripple
I can't say enough good things about XRPChat. When I first started Bitcoin trading back in 2013, I began on (what still is) the largest Bitcoin forum, Bitcointalk. While Bitcointalk serves to efficiently route and moderate conversations in a standardized manner, it doesn't allow for many nice additions like custom avatars (at least not for “newbies”), clubs, emotive reactions, or an intuitive feed and side navigation. XRPChat has all those missing items and more, and is ideally suited to the member who likes to do research and converse with others in a methodical fashion. I highly recommend it for any trader that needs to understand the value of XRP's use cases.
XRP Long Term Investors: XRPChat and Ripple Collateral. XRPChat is ideal for in-depth research and discussions. You'll find a treasure trove of resources on XRPChat that are usually very well-sourced. They will lead you to yet more information for deep comparative analysis.
All Ripple employees tend to be leaders in their field, and current (and former) Ripple employees frequent XRPChat to discuss projects and industry trends. The conversations are well-moderated. Sometimes investors are provided opportunities to pose questions to Ripple employees via conversations on the forum that will help them make investment decisions.
In addition to XRPChat, long-term investors would do well to heavily research existing Ripple collateral to learn about XRP, the XRP Ledger, and ILP. This material is very well-sourced, and can lead long-term investors to valuable insights and information.
Final Thought
Ripple has methodically built a well-organized collection of tools for helping banks and financial institutions connect and use blockchain technology. ILP and the XRP Ledger exist because of the direct efforts of the company, and XRP is the industry standard for value storage and transfer; it is the first crypto-currency to be used by banks to transfer value, and will continue to build momentum as banks forge ahead to realize the cost savings from Ripple technology.
Although Ripple is a private company, and we cannot purchase stock, ordinary investors can easily purchase any amount of XRP they wish to add to their investment portfolio. In this way, we can participate in the imminent world-wide adoption of Ripple technology.
The standard recommendations for new investors are easily accessed with a minimum of effort, and it's easy to participate in the growth and adoption of the most promising digital asset and crypto-currency; XRP.

A young male student was allegedly raped after classes on Monday at a Michigan high school in the United States, The Anon Journal has learned.
Warning: This story contains graphic details For the latest on this story visit the Fordson incident page
Multiple independent sources, who will not be identified due to confidentiality reasons, told the Journal that a first-year student who had recently made the American football team at Fordson High School in Dearborn was assaulted by three older players after school.
Sources said two of the players pinned the student down, while a third perpetrator forcefully shoved their penis in the victim's mouth, and thrashed their genitals on theirs face.
The first-year student, who the Journal will not name due to being a minor, and their parents, filed a police report the following day, but there has been no further known development in that action.
Fordson High School has refused to take disciplinary actions of any kind but suspended the perpetrator calling it an act of “hazing.”
The high school posted a public statement on its website saying it was aware of a “hazing incident” in an attempt to “share factual information” on a story circulating in the school's community.
The school does not acknowledge any allegations of sexual assault on a boy by male classmates, but acknowledged the severity of the incident and explained that “appropriate disciplinary measures” were taken.
The superintendent of the Dearborn Public Schools also posted a statement on the incident, saying social media has created “rumors that are inaccurate.”
Dr Glen Maleyko, however, did make clear that the incident was not rape but would not go further in what the exact circumstances were.
Mr Maleyko said that confidentiality and student privacy law prevented them from disclosing further details on the incident.
The statement said that “all responsible are being dealt with appropriately and we have been in contact with the Dearborn Police to determine if any further legal action will be taken.”
A student involved with organizing a silent protest during the Fordson pep rally on Friday in support of the rape victim told the Journal that flyers would be distributed criticizing the incident and the school's alleged subsequent inaction.
Those involved in the protest believe that the victim was raped and want to bring attention to what they believe is dishonesty from Fordson High School.
Those involved stood outside the school with protest signs with sources saying security pushed them out.
The Journal's press division called the school late on Thursday for comment on this story but there was no answer.
The school, in response to the growing attention over the incident, addressed the students on Friday morning.
The Journal acquired the audio of the announcement where a school official said an investigation into the incident involved the police and the administration.
They stressed that spreading rumors would be detrimental to the situation.
“Behaviour that is not aligned to our core values is not tolerated, nor is it acceptable,” the staff member said.
“I am so thankful I am part of the Fordson community because in difficult times we come together to help and support each other.”
At the end of the statement another individual appears to say “that's a lie.”

A separate individual who asked to remain anonymous told the Journal that this is a “bigger issue in Fordson athletics.”
Three different people confirmed that last year members of the baseball team held a peer down and administered a “hand job”.

The high school is located in Dearborn near Detroit in the state of Michigan.

If the first public hearing is any indication, Boston supporters of rooms where drug users would inject under medical supervision have a long road ahead of them.
Passions ran high before the hearing on bringing supervised injection facilities, or SIFs, to Boston even began Monday.
A Boston City Council hearing took up the debate around installing a supervised injection facility in Boston. Advocates argued SIFs help prevent drug overdose deaths. (Martha Bebinger/WBUR)
A redhead named Whitney, standing outside the Boston City Council chambers, described a crushing spinal injury that introduced them to morphine 30 years ago. Now, with fentanyl in most bags sold on the street, Whitney says she's overdosed 11 times since January. If Boston had a supervised injection facility, Whitney says she'd use it.
"It's horrible, I don't want to die, but I'm in pain," said Whitney, their voice shaking. "So I have to go into a port-a-potty and shoot up 'cause I have nowhere safe to go, and I overdose? It's so sad, it's not right."
Inside the chamber, a panel of supporters urged council members to back opening a SIF in Boston.
"SIFs save lives," said Dr. Gabriel Wishik, an addiction specialist at the Boston Health Care for the Homeless Program. "We desperately need this option in Boston."
Wishik ticked off a list of reasons:
Boston City Councilor Frank Baker, one of two councilors who called the hearing, listened to four other doctors and public health specialists outline the benefits of SIFs.
"I'm still not convinced by your testimony, like not even close, that it will be helpful," Baker said, mentioning the low rates of referral to treatment in 2015. If the city did allow SIFs, Baker said, there should be a limit on the number of days — perhaps between three and seven — for each drug user. After that, they'd have to go into detox.
"I think it might be the wrong path to make it easier for users," they said. "It's almost like, it should be more difficult to use."
Doctors on the panel said the cap might not make sense because addiction is a chronic disease.
Aubri Esters, an active drug user, broke into the debate. Esters say they spend hours every day in the section of Baker's district known as "Methadone Mile."
"It's already an injection facility," Esters said. "People are already injecting publicly all over the place. We all know that. It's just not supervised. There's no one making sure folks aren't dying."
Councilor Michael Flaherty said he's disturbed by the idea of doctors or nurses supervising illegal drug use.
"So we're going to watch them inject, snort or whatever?" Flaherty asked. "And then we're going to sit by and wait to see whether we have to jump in and render assistance? I think that is absolutely asinine."
Fox News Latino
Now this is a bizarre way to scare away burglars.
Most people use scary dogs or high-tech home alarm systems to protect their homes. But a doctor in the Federal District of Brasilia, Brazil decided on an unusual alternative: HIV-tainted needles.
The doctor, who says they grew tired of burglars pilfering their home while they were away at work, installed a wall of needles tainted with HIV-positive blood. They also put up a cardboard sign in front of their home with an ominous message, “Wall with HIV-positive Blood. Do Not Jump,” according to TV Globo in Brazil, who did not identify the doctor.
About a third of all people living in HIV/AIDS in Latin America live in Brazil, according to USAID.
It's unclear whether their trick has worked. But at least would-be burglars don't have to encounter loud dogs.
Watch the TV Globo report here.
SUNNYVALE — A controversial gun control measure that would propel this politically moderate — and comparatively low-crime — South Bay city to the forefront of what had been a stalled national movement to restrict firearms, had an insurmountable lead late Tuesday.
Measure C — which requires gun owners to report a loss or theft of their weapon to police within 48 hours, to keep firearms locked up when not in the owner's direct possession and prohibits ammunition magazines that hold more than 10 rounds — received 66 percent support with all precincts counted, with 34 percent voting no. It was a resounding victory for Mayor Tony Spitaleri, who decided to push for the new law after last year's massacre in Newtown, Conn. The returns are unofficial with provisional and last-minute mail-in votes still to be counted.
The mayor's preferred slate of candidates for three open City Council seats also was leading late Tuesday. Gustav Larsson led Andy Frazer 53 percent to 47 percent for Seat 1; Glenn Hendricks with 58 percent took a commanding lead over Steve Hoffman with 36 percent and Gustavo Magana, 6 percent, for Seat 2; and Jim Griffith led Tap Merrick, 66 percent to 34 percent.
The gun measure attracted statewide, and even some national, attention because of the involvement of New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg — who donated $3,000 in support of Measure C — on one side, and the National Rifle Association — which was threatening to sue the pants off Sunnyvale if the measure passed — on the other.
Before a room full of supporters at a Sunnyvale hotel Tuesday night, Spitaleri declared, “What we did here, quite bluntly, is we defeated the NRA tonight.”
Spitaleri had prodded the City Council to put the issue before voters after a brief petition drive for a ballot measure garnered more than 1,100 signatures.
But in Sunnyvale, the real passion play was about the composition of the next City Council, a body so riven with personality conflicts and sniping that many citizens flock to the council chambers to binge watch the show in person instead of on cable.
After Councilman Pat Meyering was censured by their colleagues earlier this year, their opponents — not least among them the mayor — posed the idea that Tuesday's election would be what Spitaleri called “a referendum on civility.”
Candidates seen as sympathetic to Meyering's often combative approach to commercial development — Frazer, Merrick and Hoffman — were portrayed by the mayor as disruptive.
In a town with such polarized politics, a former councilman worried that some voters would miss the point of Tuesday's balloting. “It's a very important election,” said Tim Risch, who, with their wife, Yolanda, runs SpecialInterestWatch.org, a website that monitors local issues. “And I should emphasize that in this election, the issue of civility is a red herring, it's a distraction from the real issues, which are development, employee pensions and fiscal responsibility.”
Risch's website had taken note of an identical pair of “independent expenditures” — an eye-popping $70,580 each — that benefited the campaigns of Larsson and Hendricks.
The money was spent by the National Association of Realtors, whose spokesperson in Washington, D.C., said the million-member trade association was acting at the behest of the Silicon Valley Association of Realtors. That organization's spokesperson, Rose Meily, indicated Sunnyvale was a real estate plum ripe for picking.
“I know that Sunnyvale is a real important election to us,” Meily said, “and I know they wanted to make sure the voters knew about the best qualified candidates.”
With major developments such as the new 600,000-square-foot LinkedIn headquarters going up in Sunnyvale, an infusion of national PAC money unlike any ever seen before had some in the city of 146,000 worried.
“Sunnyvale is clearly on the cusp of a major development boom,” Risch said. “And those are incredibly large numbers for a local race like this. It's just astounding.”
Over 300 microtremors hit the northern area of Valencia and southern Catalonia the first week of October. The quakes could be related to the recent injection of natural gas by the Castor Project [es], a submarine natural gas company found along the Mediterranean coasts of those areas.
The injection is meant to convert an empty oil reserve into a gas storage facility. The Spanish government has stopped [es] the gas injection, which began a few weeks ago, until technical reports clarify the matter. The company denies the injection caused the tremors, but ecological and political sectors view a direct relationship, and local online movements have begun to speak out against the project using the hashtag #projectecastor [ca] (Castor Project) on Twitter. The protests connect [ca] the injection practices with the globally controversial technique of fracking.
The Castor Project boasts [es] an oil well 1,750 meters (approximately 1.1 miles) deep that stores enough gas to serve up to a third of the Spanish demand. The project, which cost 1.3 billion euros (1.762 billion US dollars), was granted approval by a joint venture with the canadian CLP (30 percent) and the Spanish ACS (70 percent), a construction company supervised by Florentino Pérez, who also oversees the football club Real Madrid.
Even though the movement against the project emerged strongly after these possibly related quakes, some ecologists and politicians have already been warning against these same sorts of threats for some time. On their blog, European parliament member and ecologist Raül Romeva noted [ca] that the concern over this gas company should not come as unexpected:
Potser hi ha qui s'ha sorprès amb les recents notícies relacionades amb els moviments sísmics que han tingut lloc a la costa, davant de Vinaròs, relacionats amb la planta d'emmagatzematge de gas, més coneguda com a Projecte Castor. No obstant, cal recordar que fa molt de temps que molta gent ens ve advertint dels riscos vinculats a aquesta mena d'explotacions, i que han fet arribar a les diferents institucions les seves preocupacions.
Perhaps there are some who have been surprised by the recent news related to the seismic movements that took place on the coast, in front of Vinaròs, related to the oil plant, better know as the Castor Project. Nevertheless, we must remember that a long time ago, many people warned us about the risks linked to this kind of cultivation, and that their concerns were sent to the different institutions.
On Twitter, Juan López de Uralde, member of the political and social movement EQUO [es], warned of the consequences that a project like Castor could create and criticizes the Spanish energy policy:
Atentos a #Castor en la costa mediterránea. Pone de manifiesto la absurda política energética española: apoyo al gas y castigo a renovables.— Juan López de Uralde (@juralde) October 1, 2013
Regarding #Castor on the Mediterranean coast. It shows the absurd Spanish energy policy: support for gas and punishment for renewables.
The mayors of some of the towns affected by the tremors have come out against the project, as announced in this tweet from the Platform in Defense of the Lands of Sénia [ca/es], located in the town of Sénia on the Catalan border near Valencia:
Marcelino Domingo, alcalde del PP de Benicarló, anuncia al seu perfil de FB q demanarà la paralització i desmantellament del #ProjecteCastor— Plataforma pel Sénia (@plataformasenia) October 1, 2013
Marcelino Domingo, head of the People's Party [es] in Benicarló, announces on their FB profile that he'll order the cessation and dismantling of #ProjecteCastor
In an interview with the leading Catalan online periodical, VilaWeb [ca], Lluc Ulldemolins, of the same Sénia Platform, shows the fears of uncertainty about the origin of the earthquakes, which continue even though the Spanish government assures that the gas injection has stopped:
—Sí, l'empresa diu que ja no injecta gas, però els terratrèmols han agafat més intensitat. I això encara és més preocupant. Si sabéssim que hi ha terratrèmols perquè s'injecta gas, tindríem la causa controlada. Però si és cert que l'empresa ho ha aturat, i amb tot i això els terratrèmols continuen, és que la situació és més complicada que no ens podíem imaginar. A qui ens hem de creure? Realment preferiríem que fos l'empresa que mentís, no per donar-li la culpa, sinó perquè almenys sabríem la raó dels moviments sísmics.
—Yes, the company says they no longer inject gas, but the earthquakes have gained force. And that's even more worrisome. If we knew that there were tremors because gas has been injected, we would have the cause controlled. But if it's true that the company has stopped injecting, and yet the quakes still continue, the situation is more complicated than we could ever imagine. Who are we to believe? We'd really prefer that the company lie, not to put them at fault, but rather to, at least, know the reason behind the seismic movements.
While the indignation and fear grow within the population, the natural gas company, according to some press reports [es], has begun to make arrangements to get rid of the grant and charge a compensation. The company has the right to reverse the grant to the state and receive the net value as compensation, since the project was promoted by Ministry of Industry.
Because your bottle needs to hide its shame.
Those amusing little underpants designed for drink bottles that made headlines on many English language news sites when they were first released a couple of years ago are back.
Advertised as a way to catch the moisture that drips off of a cold drink bottle on a hot day and “guard” the “butt” of your bottle on a cold day (not sure what that even means), “Bottle Underpants” (ボトルのおぱんつ, botoru no opantsu) started being sold via capsule toy vending machines (gacha gacha) at Japanese arcades and toy stores in 2015 and apparently they've developed enough of a following to warrant not one, but two new series of these novelty bottle butt covers.
The third and latest set of Bottle Underpants was released in January of this year and consists of seven original designs, pictured below.
The seven new pairs of underwear that make up this latest set includes a “fluffy” pair of women's panties, a pair of light blue panties, a pair of “cherry” panties, a pair of “pumpkin” panties, a pair of “demon” underpants with a lightning bolt inspired pattern, a pair of sexy “adult” panties and a “secret” pair of underpants, which is not listed on the paper that comes inside every Bottle Underpants capsule but more on those “secret” underpants later.
If you'd like to see how exactly one of these pair of underpants looks on a bottle, check out the video below, which was uploaded to YouTube last month by a Japanese YouTuber who goes by the name of Potato Cider. In the video, they go through the process of buying one of these from a capsule vending machine, opening the capsule and of course, seeing how the pair of cherry panties they got actually looks on a bottle.
As for the “secret” pair of underpants mentioned above, a reporter for the Japanese news site Otakuma wrote an article this month (May 13), in which they spill the beans on these mysterious underpants. So what are they? They're a pair of male briefs, complete with a little fly. To see some amusing pictures of these tiny briefs, check out the article here.
If you'd like your own pair of Bottle Underpants you'll have to go looking around Japanese arcades and wherever else has capsule toy vending machines. Each pair will cost you 200 JPY.

I, Ib Reksasolthez the Weaver, have begun this record of events to share with those who come after the tale of the downfall of the once-mighty fortress Atirshistsak. Or, as some of us called it, “A Shit-Sack.” I was not much more than what you'd call a “dabbling” writer, but having little else to do, I studied several fine books on the subject in the vacant halls of our library before setting quill to page, so that my account could be more legible. I have set the events down as true to my memory as possible. You will note that this diary is being written on the finest of vellum. Why not? There's no one left to scold me for being wasteful. The librarians are all dead. The broker is dead, so no one will ever even know how many pages of this fine, soft vellum I have wasted with my scribbling. Even the Mayor is dead. I suppose I can be the Mayor now… But I'm getting ahead of myself.
14TH OF GRANITE, EARLY SPRING, OF THE YEAR 527
Today is, I hope, to be the day on which I finally determine the sex of the skilled jewelcutter dwarf, Catten Agdobar, who works in the shop across from my loom. Catten came with the latest wave of migrants, and has no family living in Shit-Sack. But with that soft, luxurious flowing beard, those delicate, adept hands, and those broad, muscular calves, Catten, just *has* to be female, right? If Catten turns out to be another male, I'm going to have some very strange feelings to sort out…
An Elven caravan showed up today. Those bastards. Why do they even bother anymore? They have almost nothing we want or need. I think the broker has just been continuing to trade with them for the sake of honing their trading skills, and getting rid of useless trinkets that are cluttering up our fort, which somehow seem to make the days drag by with amazing slowness. I guess maybe all that time clambering over all of the goblets slows us down. Anyway, the Tree-huggers showed up looking pale and shaken (even more pale than usual, if you can believe that) babbling about a massive horde of goblins they saw off in the distance on their way. I hope they don't try to use that as an excuse to stay extra long. We didn't think much of it, as our military is mighty. They are lead by a couple of legendary hammerlords and macelords, and are equipped in the finest of steel armor and the sharpest of steel weapons, forged right here in Shit-Sack by our very own legendary smiths. That's more than enough to deal with a rabble of goblin scum, right?
16TH OF GRANITE
An ambush! Curse them! Today I was finally going to come out and ask Catten if he/she had a stalactite or a cavern under those leather trousers, and the goblins decided to show up. The Captain of the Guard announced a civilian alert, and now everyone is scrambling around in a panic, and I can't even find Catten.
17TH OF GRANITE
Today, things got serious. All five squads of our brave, invincible military were lined up just inside the entrance, just out of sight, waiting for the pitiful rabble of goblins to stumble through our extensive field of traps before heading out to do clean-up duty when the reports starting to rush in, one after another: more goblins had been sighted. And more. And more, and more. This was no measly raiding force, this was an all-out invasion. They were coming at us from 4 different directions, riding beasts of war. Reports varied, but the general consensus was that we were facing a horde of over threescore goblins. A force like this had never been seen before in Shit-Sack. I have done some digging through the library, and I can't find a record of a force this size being seen by any fortress in recent memory.
Our original plan was to remain out of sight, let the traps do their work, and then let the Elven caravan guards get slaughtered, hopefully taking a few of the goblins out in the process, before charging out to meet the enemy on the field of battle. But then we received word that a group of civilians is trapped on the outside, having apparently ignored the civilian alert. They were running to and fro, panic stricken, along the southern border of our lands. Their face grim-set, the Captain of the Guard ordered the squads forward…
18TH OF GRANITE
It was all in vain. The enemy were far too many, and far too organized in their multi-faceted assault. Their fearsome drow-spiders webbed many of our warriors right at the first clash of steel upon steel, decimating our forces. The trapped civilians were slaughtered, along with all five squads of our military, to a man. And we'd barely made a dent in the enemy forces. Hastily, the mayor ordered a few squads of untrained civilians to take up weapons and gather inside the fort's entrance, falling back to our original plan of letting our traps, and the elves, do the work for us, but the enemy still outnumbered us nearly 2 to 1.
19TH OF GRANITE
The plan worked, but just barely. A sizeable force of goblins broke through our deadly weapon traps, smashed the Elven caravan, and rushed through our last-ditch line of defense of cage traps littering our entrance, to meet the untrained, fearful, hastily armed militia in a slobbering, howling, bloodthirsty frenzy. The battle was short, but intense. Only a meager handful of dwarfs survived, and most of those were gravely wounded.
28TH OF GRANITE
Things are looking grim at Shit-Sack. Our once-mighty fortress of over a hundred dwarfs has dwindled down to less than a score, not counting the vermi- I mean children. Tempers are flaring as dwarfs release their anguish over lost loved ones and the horrors of battle in the form of violent tantrums. The wounded and injured are dying, one-by-one. Some are bleeding to death from lack of medical care, but most are simply dying of thirst, as the tantruming dwarfs refuse to bring water to those who can't walk on their own. More dwarves get wounded every day as fights break out, and as things stand in Shit-Sack right now, a wounded dwarf might as well be a dead dwarf.
12TH OF SLATE, MID-SPRING
The worst is over now, if that can be said, if only because there is no one left alive aside from myself, 9 children, and one other adult dwarf, a useless moron. He's (it would be a “he”, wouldn't it? I had hopes of single-handedly repopulating the fort…) a completely unskilled peasant named Melbil Mat. Melbil was a hauler before the goblins came, and was so deep underground that everything was over by the time they finally finished dragging a lump of Schist up the hundred or so flights of stairs to the stone stockpile. We used to tease them back in the day, and tell them that if they worked hard enough and hauled well enough, they might someday become a noble, and claim the titled of Master Hauler. I try hard to avoid him, but they caught me in the dining room having my breakfast rum this morning. This was our conversation:
“So Ib, you're the Mayor now, right?”
“Yeah. What do you want? Oh, and that reminds me – as my first act as Mayor, I shall issue a mandate against the exportation of goblets! Because why? Because screw this fort!”
“That's nice Ib… Say, when did we vote you in?”
“Ahh, er…” My eyes darted around. “It was last Tuesday Melbil, don't you remember? Ohhh, that's right, you were busy hauling, so you got marked down as ‘abstained'.”
“Oh… Well I guess that's fair then. Well, since you're the Mayor now, that means you can appoint me to the Master Hauler position now, right?”
“What? Oh. Yeah, sure kid, whatever you want.”
“Oh thank you thank you Ib! This is the happiest day of my life!”
At this point, my eyes gleamed with a sudden inspiration.
“But Melbil, are you sure you're ready for all of the extra duties and responsibilities that the Master Hauler position carries?” Their face fell.
“What extra duties, Ib? No one's ever mentioned extra duties…”
“Well sure there are extra duties, Melbil! You don't think becoming a noble is all fun and games do you?”
“Well Ib, I couldn't help but notice that once you became Mayor, you helped yourself to the noble's stockpile of exquisite lavish prepared meals and wonderful booze…”
“What? Oh, that. Kid, with just the two of us, there's enough of that stuff to last us both for many seasons to come. Help yourself. Now about those extra duties…”
“Yeah?”
“The Master Hauler is responsible not just for hauling, but also for: burial of the dead, cleaning, feeding the animals, disposing of remains, fertilizing the fields, farming…” I racked my brain for any other jobs that I hated. “…and doing the Mayor's laundry. I can't believe you didn't know all this, kid.”
“You can count on me sir! I'll be the best damned Master Hauler this fort has ever seen!”
“I just bet you will, kid. Now, about that laundry… You make sure not to lose any of my socks, okay!”
“Yes sir!”
22ND OF SLATE
The kid isn't doing so hot with the burying of the dead. It's been nearly a month, (the days are just FLYING by now, with no one around to get in my path) and rotting corpses still litter the fields in front of our forts. It's not all their fault though; we quickly ran out of coffins, and these delicate weaver's hands were absolutely NOT made for chiseling lumps of rock into coffins, so it's very slow going. You make a mistake with the loom, and you just unravel the thread and keep going. Make a mistake with a big hunk of rock, and it goes in the “to be prospected” pile and you start all over.
But I have to work faster. The ghosts are appearing. Ghosts everywhere. I creep from silent, haunted corridor to silent, haunted corridor, trying to avoid notice. At first it wasn't so bad, it made the fort seem a little less empty, but now they are getting angry. Objects are disappearing, and yesterday one threw something at me.
28TH OF SLATE
I threw my first tantrum yesterday, though I must say it wasn't my fault. I was…possessed by the ghost of my erstwhile crush Catten. I believe that they (yes, SHE, of course) found my diary, and became angry at me for never speaking up about my feelings. They took control of my body, threw a few things around, and started a fistfight with one of the little brats that are always running around underfoot. I must say, feeling my masonry-toughened knuckles bash into that little whiny kid's bearded chin was the most satisfying thing that's happened in Shit-Sack since the day I unlocked the door to the nobles' booze stockpile.
3RD OF FELSITE
Some migrants have arrived! Finally, more dwarfs to entertain all these kids, and share in the burial duties. Wait… Two. There's only two of them. And one of them had the audacity to comment on the corpses that remain rotting in the fields. You know what I had to say to that? “Here's your chisel, buddy. Get crackin on those coffins. And you, here's another. Start engraving those slabs.”
14TH OF GRANITE, EARLY SPRING, OF THE YEAR 528
Well, it seems that The Great Goblin Invasion of '27 might not be the end of Shit-Sack after all. Against all odds, I, Mayor Ib Reksasolthez, have carried the fortress through its darkest night, and have seen it through to the dawn of a new era. We had a sizable migration wave last season, and our numbers are back up over a score. We have begun planning new defensive measures to assure ourselves that we'll never be caught off guard like that again. If all goes well, our fort will be nigh-on impregnable in about a month or so, and we can start thinking about training up a solid military again.
15TH OF GRANITE
An ambush! Curse them! … … …

We publish about 35 letters each week. We often select comments that respond directly to USA TODAY articles or opinion pieces. Letters that are concise and make one or two good points have the best chance of being selected, as do letters that reflect the vibrant debate around the nation on a particular subject. We aim to make the letters platform a place where readers, not just writers representing institutions or interest groups, have their say. How to submit letters The players are signed, the "Decision" is made, but the passions around this year's extraordinary class of NBA free agents refuses to die down. What surprises me is the amount of negative commentary directed at the three top free agents (especially LeBron James ) who decided to play on the same team and to create a great franchise together. Of course, any club owner dreams of having those players, including me, but all questions of how the announcements were made aside, I respect their choice, and no one has the right to judge them. I want to say that I support LeBron, the best athlete in the NBA. They had a truly difficult choice to make. Any move they made was sure to be viewed as wrong, and to leave many unhappy fans. Basing their decision on achieving results on the basketball court shows that the sportsman won the day, not the showman or the business person. What is wrong with that? We are seeing the birth of a new, dynamic team with such star players, and all of us can await the new season with great anticipation. I wish them success and give them my moral support. I will be happy for us to beat the Miami Heat in the conference finals, maybe not this season, but in the very near future.

Most people with elderly conservative relatives are familiar with conservative fundraising and petition emails and letters. A classic example of the form at right comes from Heritage Foundation founder Paul Weyrich's Free Congress Research and Education Foundation, as noted by Rick Perlstein, who chronicled the distinct style of the right-wing fearmongering fundraising letter for The Baffler. The letters tell apocalyptic stories about atheist professors who want to teach gay sex to kindergarteners, or United Nations plots to doom the U.S. dollar, or your average smug elite laughing all the way to the bank, and only you can stop them by donating $5, $10, or $25. A more recent example comes from Newt Gingrich's Gingrich Productions, which sent out this threat that Obama could run for a third term, below.
Breitbart News is reporting Shields's criticism on these hyperbolic fundraising letters as, well, hyperbolically as they usually do, spinning it into an attack on the conservative grassroots by the Republican Establishment. The RNC later clarified that Shields was only attacking "beltway professionals whose focus is solely to make a profit off the party and movement." But not everyone was convinced. Leahy thought Shields was attacking non-Beltway groups like FreedomWorks and Tea Party Patriots.) Brent Bozell, Chairman of ForAmerica, said Shields' comments were "insulting." FreedomWorks' Matt Kibbe said, "It's sad to hear that GOP insiders are disparaging the freedom community behind closed doors..." An anonymous Republican source told Leahy that Shields was not to be trusted:
Shields is dangerous. They have no internal compass, and their political mentor is Congressman Dave Reichert. Reichert is probably the most liberal Republican in the House. They have never had a job in the private sector.
But Erick Erickson, Fox News pundit and editor of the conservative blog RedState, defended Shields. In February, Erickson said their site would hire more reporters, because conservative media had a tendency to shoot itself in the foot by focusing more on generating outrage than on finding facts. "We do our cause more harm than good if we get outrageously outraged over every slight and grievance," Erickson said. So it makes sense Erickson would also be tired of outrage-generating emails. They write:
The professional right needs to be blown up. My regret is that they and those around them claim they were not going as far as it is claimed they went. I would want them to go further.
Perhaps it's personal, because like Shields, Erickson has to tell their mom to ignore some mailings.
My mother constantly gets mail at their house begging them for money to fight the good fight. More often than not, the groups begging them for help have “Tea Party” in their name and they are all scams.
But Erickson says the RNC is to blame, too. Note that it's easy to imagine this line in a post at Wonkette:
The RNC too has become a junk mail / spam machine pulling on the heartstrings of older Americans and, when all else fails, sending out cardboard backed photographs of Ronald Reagan.
We can all get behind shaming people who try to scam old folks out in the heartland. But Republicans might want to make sure their politicians in Washington don't get scammed by forwards, either.

“Hamrlik has been offered a few teams, but the Capitals are very demanding,” reports Renaud Lavoie of RDS, via the powers of Google Translate.
Teams in search of a veteran presence on the blueline could be interested in Hamrlik, who leads the Capitals in blocked shots (119) and is 19th in the league in that category.
Given that they look every bit of their 37 years at times on the ice and is in the first season of a two-year deal with an annual salary cap hit of $3.5 million, however, Hamrlik may be a bit of a tougher sell for teams looking to add a defenseman.
One team that could possibly be a fit is St. Louis, which is in need of a veteran defenseman and recently lost some leadership with Jamie Langenbrunner (broken foot) out of the lineup. The Blues have had officials at recent Capitals games, both home and away.
In 55 games this season, Hamrlik has two goals and eight assists and a plus-1 rating while averaging 19 minutes 11 seconds of ice time per game. Over 37 games since Dale Hunter was hired in late November, Hamrlik has a plus-11 rating but the coach was blunt when asked about why the veteran would be out against the Senators Wednesday.
“We want them to be a defensive defenseman,” Hunter said. “He's giving up too many chances so he's out of the lineup. Giving up too many, took a bad penalty last game and so we're going to put someone else in.”
Over the past 10 games, Hamrlik has been on the ice for six of the 24 goals the Capitals have allowed. Hunter said that regardless of their experience, Hamrlik's performance warrants that they not be in the lineup.
“Everybody's even. We've got to make the playoffs,” Hunter said. “It's a battle of who stays in the lineup.”

— Ovechkin questionable with lower-body injury
— Despite ugly loss, Caps still in playoff race
Just as the New Orleans Pelicans are getting one player back from injury (Kendrick Perkins, who's been sidelined since Oct. 31), another will be out of the lineup Friday, due to a stomach illness. Pelicans Coach Alvin Gentry said during their pregame meeting with the media that Ryan Anderson is unable to play vs. Washington.
It's the first time in 2015-16 that Anderson will miss a game, making them a rarity on the Pelicans' roster. Anderson, Eric Gordon, Dante Cunningham and Alonzo Gee are the only NOLA players who've appeared in all 21 contests during the regular season.
“Ryan is sick tonight, so they won't play,” Gentry said. “He's got a little virus or a little flu. Nothing to be concerned about. He's in a little pain tonight, so they won't play. We've got to check it out to make sure nothing is contagious or anything. He'll be fine, but they won't be with us tonight.”
Other notes:
Friday nights are usually reserved for movie nights in our house, and I always look forward to them. It is a time for us to just sit and relax and cuddle up with a big bowl of popcorn or a yummy gooey snack. [We love all the yummy snacks we can make with the Gluten free Chex.] They actually turn into more of a Chic flick night and my DH patiently sits and watches with us, even though I know they are usually cringing through most of them. One of our favorites to watch [and his] is the Princess Bride, it has been my daughter's favorite since they were about 9! I am sure they know pretty much every line in it. They love all the Characters, especially Mandy Patinkin's Inigo Montoya.
Tonight I am picking up New Year's Eve to watch, DD has wanted to watch it for a while now and I figured since New Year's Eve really isn't that far away [wow how time has flown this year!], it would be a good time to watch it. I found a great recipe using Chex that I know will be perfect – it has chocolate in it, how could it not? This movie and a gooey snack will be perfect together!
There are so many great recipes on the Life Made Delicious Site, and they have a number of gluten free options!
I have adapted the original recipe a bit, and used honey nut Chex instead of the Chocolate Chex.
Gluten-Free Chex Caramel Crunch
8 cups Gluten free Chex® cereal [I used the honey nut]
1/2 cup packed brown sugar [I cut this down a bit]
6 tablespoons butter or margarine
3 tablespoons honey [I also cut this down to 2 tablespoons]
1/4 teaspoon baking soda
1/4 cup white vanilla baking chips or chocolate chips
1/4 cup shredded unsweetened coconut
Into large microwavable bowl, measure cereal; set aside. Line cookie sheet with waxed paper.
In 2-cup microwavable measuring cup, microwave brown sugar, butter and honey uncovered on High 1 to 2 minutes, stirring after 1 minute, until melted and smooth. Stir in baking soda until dissolved. Pour over cereal, add the coconut, stir until evenly coated. Microwave on High 3 minutes, stirring every minute. Spread on cookie sheet. Cool 10 minutes. Break into bite-size pieces.
In small microwavable bowl, microwave baking chips uncovered on High about 1 minute 30 seconds or until chips can be stirred smooth (bowl will be hot). Drizzle over snack. Refrigerate until set. Store in tightly covered container.
Can't wait for the movie or the snacks! 😉

They already know plenty about the Blues, having faced us in some big matches and been a team-mate of some of our players. Here in their first interview with the official Chelsea website, we find out more about them as Falcao talks on those games and players, their new manager, their name and past links to England…
It has been a busy summer for you…
‘Yes, I had the Copa America, playing with my national team, and then a holiday. I went for 14 days to visit my family and friends in Colombia and had time to enjoy my people, and then straight here where I have quickly joined the pre-season.'
Jose Mourinho says you come to Chelsea with great motivation to show England how good you are…
‘I am with a lot of motivation to join Chelsea. I have challenged myself to play in the Premier League and I am enjoying living this experience with a lot of motivation, with a lot of concentration, because I want to triumph with Chelsea. I want to win the league and to be important in the team.'
It must have been good to hear the manager make it clear over the course of the summer how much they admire you?
‘He sent some messages to support me and they said that they believe in me and has faith in me, and for that reason I am very grateful to them and I want to give my 100 per cent for the team and for him.'
You moved to Porto from South America five years after they left but did people there still speak about Jose Mourinho during your time?
‘Yes, they left a lot of influence in Porto, and the tactics and the way Porto plays is a legacy of what Jose did there.'
California Child Actor's Bill California State Legislature Full name California Child Actor's Bill Signed into law 1939 Website [1]
The California Child Actor's Bill (also known as Coogan Act or Coogan Bill) is a law applicable to child performers, designed to safeguard a portion of their earnings for when they enter adulthood.
The original Bill was passed in 1939 by the State of California in response to the plight of Jackie Coogan, who earned millions of dollars as a successful child actor only to discover, upon reaching adulthood, that their mother and stepfather had spent almost all of their money. Since then, it has been revised a few times, most recently on January 1, 2004.[1] As it stands, money earned and accumulated under a contract under the code remains the sole legal property of the minor child.[2]
The current version of the law is codified in sections 6750–53 of the California Family Code and section 1700.37 of the California Labor Code. The law provides that any of the parties may petition a court to approve an entertainment contract, and if the court does so, somewhat different rules apply. Most importantly, the child cannot escape their own responsibilities under the contract by disaffirming it, which a child normally has the power to do.
Later revisions extended the scope of minors' entertainment contracts that the court can approve to include contracts pursuant to which a minor renders services as an "actor, actor, dancer, musician, comedian, singer, or other performer or entertainer, or as a writer, director, producer, production executive, choreographer, composer, conductor, or designer." Under the current law, the court may also approve contracts that involve the transfer of intellectual property.[3]
This law requires a child actor's employer to set aside 15% of the earnings in a trust (often called a Coogan Account), and codifies issues such as schooling, work hours and time off.[4]

Toyota announced today that it will start selling buses that run on hydrogen fuel-cells in Tokyo next year in advance of the 2020 Summer Olympics. That news (first reported by Endgadget) in-and-of-itself isn't that interesting — many cities across the globe have fleets of hydrogen-powered buses — but Toyota's bus a nifty secret power: in an emergency situation, it can also operate as a high-powered external power generator.
“The Toyota Group considers the use of hydrogen to be a powerful source of energy for the future,” the company said in a statement, noting that its zero-emission Mirai fuel-cell sedan just went on sale.
Toyota's fuel-cell buses will run on more powerful platform than the Mirai, with up to 10 fuel tanks holding 600 liters of highly pressurized H2 and producing 235 kwh, or almost three times the output of a Tesla Model S battery. This is what allows Toyota's bus to double as an external power supply.
three times the output of a Tesla Model S
This bus isn't the only vehicle that can be used as a power generator — GM's Chevy Colorado ZH 2 is being used by the US Army to do just that — but Toyota says its bus' fuel cells can generate enough power to light up a whole evacuation site, such as a school gymnasium.
The goal is to sell up to 100 buses in Tokyo before the start of the summer games. The Japanese government has committed to spending up to $6 billion to bolster Tokyo's transportation infrastructure, including new roads and airport, rail, and port upgrades.
All Koreans celebrate Chuseok , but how does it differ for defectors who have recently arrived in the South?
North Koreans on their favourite holiday: 'We celebrate even in the bad times'
On the 15th day of the eighth lunar month, North Koreans celebrate Chuseok, a three-day harvest festival.
An estimated 30 million Koreans from both sides of the border mark the occasion by visiting relatives' graves before coming together to share food – a key part of this ancient tradition that was all but abandoned by the North in the 1990s, as the country suffered a devastating famine.
However, according to recent defectors, the situation in the North has improved dramatically. They say while food shortages still occur, Chuseok is now considered by many to be the most important holiday of the year – with food once again playing a central role.
According to Kim, a defector who left the North in April last year, the day is a time of celebration. “During the bad times, when you're constantly worrying about yoursurvival, you can forget about the daily humdrum and enjoy yourself, and eat to your fill,” they say.
The Arduous March: growing up in North Korea during famine Read more
Public holidays are frequent in North Korea – with one held almost every month as part of the regime's propaganda agenda. People often take the day off work to participate in local celebrations. Those who do not take part risk falling under the suspicion of the authorities.
A painful time

Chuseok traditions follow a similar pattern North and South of the border, and for some defectors it is a time to reminisce about the lives they left behind.
The Korean war ended in 1953 in an armistice, not a peace agreement. The two countries have technically remained at war ever since, and many of the North Koreans who fled have been permanently separated from their loved ones since, forced to build a new life after the border was effectively sealed.
“There are stores selling fruit everywhere in Seoul, but in North Korea it was a rare treat that we could only enjoy on Chuseok. I remember how it was so expensive that I would worry while working in the markets that my children would eat all the fruit,” says Park, another defector now living in the South.
Jang, a former child beggar, says they used to wish it was Chuseok every day when they lived in the North. Now they live in the South it is a more painful and reflective time. “Unlike the Koreans living here, I can't go back to the hometown and I can't visit my parents' grave, and that makes me feel guilty,” they say.
The celebrations also serve as a reminder of how tough life used to be. “I remember lying in empty crop fields with my other orphan friends on the night of Chuseok, sharing memories with them,” they say.
For the orphans, most fruit was a luxury. One friend of Jang's recalled the first time they ever ate a banana, a gift from an aunt. Another friend reminisced about eating an apple, core and all, leaving only the stem.
Chuseok, widely known as Korean thanksgiving, was also a time of hospitality, Jang recalls. “During the day, the most delicious smells came from every corner of mountains – unlike any other day of the year. Elders drank and looked happy too,” they say.
“When it was time for lunch, people started to gather at the tombs of their ancestors. Some even invited us to join them. They would wrap pancakes, eggs, rice cakes, fish, and other dishes… these were the kinds of people who ordinarily chased us beggars away – but on Chuseok, they became charitable.”

It's common to forget how dirty your keyboard can get. It's something we use every day and often eat over, resulting in grime from our finger tips on the key caps, and crumbs hiding inside the keyboard itself. Purchasing a mechanical keyboard is making an investment in a piece of equipment with the expectation it will last a long time. In order to make sure your keyboard lasts, you need to maintain it, and that includes regularly giving it a light cleaning with more in-depth cleanings as needed.
It's important to be careful when cleaning a mechanical keyboard to avoid damaging either the electronics or the switches inside. The last thing you want to do is soak it in water and immediately plug it in, as this will short out the electronics. There are also a few keys on the keyboard that are difficult to remove and replace. For those keys, we recommend they be left alone as it is possible to clean the keyboard without removing them. With this last installment of the mechanical keyboard guide we share all of our tips and tricks to keeping your keyboard in good working order.

California-based Chevron Corp. is looking at selling its 20 per cent stake in the Athabasca Oil Sands Project in northern Alberta, according to a media report.
The company has discussed with investment banks the idea of selling its stake in the oilsands mine and upgrading project, Reuters reported Thursday, citing anonymous sources.
Chevron did not immediately respond to a request for comment. A spokesperson for project operator Royal Dutch Shell said it wouldn't comment on another company's business decision.
Several foreign oil companies have reduced their oilsands holdings but that isn't necessarily a bad thing, Alberta Premier Rachel Notley said Thursday when asked about the Chevron report.
"In the oilsands ... you are seeing a reorganization," they said, adding the consolidation of ownership mainly by Canadian companies is allowing more efficient and sustainable production.
"What we are seeing is a specialization within the oil and gas industry and we think our national companies are the ones that are often best placed to deliver that specialization and we are very pleased that that investment is happening."
Foreign companies selling oilsands assets
Last month, Shell announced it had agreed to sell most of its Canadian oilsands assets to Calgary-based Canadian Natural Resources for about C$11.1 billion.
The two companies also announced they would buy Houston-based Marathon Oil's 20 per cent stake in the Athabasca Oil Sands Project for a total of US$2.5 billion. Chevron's 20 per cent stake in the project was not affected.
The deals are expected to close in mid-2017.
Other foreign companies that have recently reduced exposure to the oilsands include Norway's Statoil, Arkansas-based Murphy Oil and France-based Total SA.
Last month Cenovus Energy unveiled a blockbuster $17.7-billion deal to buy most of the Canadian assets of Houston-based ConocoPhillips.
Mediaite columnist John Ziegler interviewed Evan McMullin on their latest podcast, during which, the former CIA operative slammed President Trump‘s administration for advancing a “systematic attack” on facts.
Ever since McMullin ran as the #NeverTrump alternative candidate for the 2016 election, they established themselves as a constant critic of the Trump Administration. On Sunday, McMullin spoke extensively about their current view of partisan hostilities, as well as the statement they previously tried to make against flawed presidential candidates.
The conversation went on to discuss whether Republican figures have capitulated to Trump with their reluctance to criticize their political missteps. McMullin acknowledged how Trump's rise sparked various changes in America's political thought process, and they said one of the most “frightening” changes is how many GOPers view Russia in a more positive light now.
McMullin eventually stated the ongoing Russia investigations are not “fake news” when their interference was on display throughout 2016. They went on to say that Vladimir Putin's actions and the Trump Admin's degree of connection to Russia are too significant to be dismissed outright as Leftist criticisms.
“It really begs questions I think about what is the deal with Donald Trump and Russia,” asked McMullin. “We're not going to accept leaders or would-be leaders who are aligned with the enemies of Liberty. We can't accept that.”
As the discussion continued, McMullin said that Republicans have to hold Trump more accountable to their “dangerous foolishness” if they want to maintain the GOP's long-term future. McMullin also concluded that between Trump's frequent lies and their constant battles with the media, the presidency has given way to an “assault on truth.“
“There is truth and there are facts, and without them, we cannot hold our leaders accountable,” McMullin said. “We can't become part of supporting an administration that wants to undermine truth.”

LOUISVILLE (WHAS11) – One Louisville resident has died from the West Nile virus, according to the Kentucky Department for Public Health.
The department also said there is a non-fatal case in Louisville too.
People infected with West Nile virus either show no symptoms or relatively mild symptoms; however, less than 1 percent of infected people develop a serious neurologic illness such as encephalitis or meningitis, according the Kentucky public health department.
Serious illness can occur in people of any age but people more than 60 years of age are at the greatest risk for severe disease. People with certain medical conditions, such as cancer, diabetes, hypertension, kidney disease, and people who have received organ transplants, are also at greater risk for serious illness.
Mosquitoes in areas throughout Louisville have tested positive for the West Nile virus. Mosquito samples were collected in traps as part of surveillance by the Department of Public Health and Wellness and tested by its laboratory. Mosquitoes testing positive for West Nile were collected in the following ZIP codes 40205, 40208, 40211, 40212, 40214, 40215, 40216 and 40272.
“West Nile infected mosquitoes are present throughout the community, and people should take the appropriate precautions,” said Dr. Joann Schulte, director of the Louisville Department of Public Health and Wellness.
The Louisville Metro Department of Public Health and Wellness has operated a mosquito control program for more than 50 years. The department does surveillance of mosquito populations with traps strategically located throughout the community, and tests mosquitos for such diseases as Zika and West Nile virus.
To check on areas to be fogged each week or to sign up for fogging alerts, call the mosquito hotline, 574-6641, or visit https://louisvilleky.gov.
If you want to log a complaint about mosquito problems in your neighborhood, call Metro Call by dialing 311 or 574-5000.
The Department of Public Health and Wellness also advises people to take the following precautions:
Avoid Mosquito Bites
• Use insect repellents when you go outdoors. Repellents containing DEET, picaridin, IR3535, and some oil of lemon eucalyptus and para-menthane-diol products provide longer-lasting protection. To optimize safety and effectiveness, repellents should be used according to the label instructions. More information about insect repellents can be found here at http://www.cdc.gov/westnile/faq/repellent.html.
• When weather permits, wear long sleeves, long pants and socks when outdoors. Mosquitoes may bite through thin clothing, so spraying clothes with repellent containing permethrin or another EPA-registered repellent will give extra protection. Don't apply repellents containing permethrin directly to skin. Do not spray repellent on the skin under your clothing.
• Take extra care during peak mosquito biting hours. Take extra care to use repellent and protective clothing from dusk to dawn or consider avoiding outdoor activities during these times.
Mosquito-Proof Your Home
• Install or repair screens on Windows and doors to keep mosquitoes outside. Use your air conditioning, if you have it.
• Help reduce the number of mosquitoes around your home by emptying standing water from flowerpots, gutters, buckets, pool covers, pet water dishes, discarded tires and birdbaths on a regular basis.
(CNN) The daughter of a key Trump administration Cabinet member is speaking out against the President's policy banning transgender people from serving in any capacity in the military.
President Donald Trump abruptly announced the new policy in July in a series of tweets, saying the US military "cannot be burdened with the tremendous medical costs and disruption that transgender in the military would entail."
Jennifer Detlefsen, the daughter of Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke, slammed the policy and the President in an expletive-laden Instagram post.
"This man is a disgrace. I've tried to keep politics out of my social media feed as much as possible, but this is inexcusable," said Detlefsen in a caption of a photo quoting the President's tweets on the subject in late July.
Detlefsen, a Navy veteran like their father, had strong words for the President.
"This veteran says sit down and shut the f*** up, you know-nothing, never-served piece of s***. #itmfa #wtf," they added.
ITMFA stands for "Impeach the mother f***** already."
The post was first reported by the Billings Gazette
On Friday, the White House issued a presidential memorandum with specific directives following through on Trump's tweets, instructing the military to not move forward with an Obama-era plan that would have allowed transgender individuals to be recruited into the armed forces. The memorandum also bans the Defense Department from using its resources to provide medical treatment regimens for transgender individuals currently serving in the military.
The Interior Department did not immediately respond to CNN's request for comment.
Detlefsen declined to be interviewed, however, they did place some distance between their comments and their father.
"My views are my own and not at all related to my father's position; millions of other people have said the same as I did, and more eloquently," they said in an email to CNN. "The thousands of transgender military service members who are under attack by this administration are the ones who should be given a chance to have their voices heard."
Detlefsen is now a Virginia-based glass artist working primarily in the color pink.
"I make art about the double standards, taboos and cultural expectations that govern the lives and bodies of women," they wrote in a biography on their website.
They haven't been quiet about their political views in the past, posting a photo from their polling place on election day that included the hashtags "#dumptrump," "#imwithher" and "#vetsagainsttrump."
They participated in the women's march after Trump's inauguration in January.
Detlefsen has received mostly supportive comments on the July post, including many from their fellow service members.
But they also responded to those who commented with criticism.
"I could have, perhaps should have, used more elegant language. I didn't because I was -- and am -- angry. But the President themselves is lowering the level of discourse in our political climate, so please point that finger elsewhere," they responded to one user.
"I am most certainly not misinformed -- and in fact spent a good deal of time in the service reviewing the medical records of people applying for special forces programs," they said to another.
Reversal of the Obama-era decision to allow transgender troops to serve, they said Monday, was on the "wrong side of history."
"The military been a giant social engineering experiment since near its inception. From racial integration to opening up career paths to women, decade by decade the military has, by necessity of wanting to recruit and retain the best possible fighting force, been at the vanguard of progressive progress. At each step there have been those who decried the changes- and you know what? They've been shown to be on the wrong side of history. Every. Time," they wrote.

William Christopher Gibbs (Facebook)
William Christopher Gibbs, a 27-year-old man from Fannin County, Georgia is under FBI investigation after driving themselves to the hospital last week, claiming they came into contact with the deadly substance ricin.
Fannin County Sheriff Dane Kirby confirmed that Gibbs' car tested positive for ricin, a deadly poison that is found in castor beans. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the substance can come in the form of a powder, a mist, a pellet, or can be dissolved in liquid and just a small amount of it can kill. The CDC notes, “It would take a deliberate act to make ricin and use it to poison people.”
It is unclear how or for what reason Gibbs came into contact with the ricin. The FBI “identified no evidence that any poisonous or toxic substances have been dispersed or that the public is at risk,” according to prosecutors who spoke with Fox News.
Gibbs' Facebook profile indicates the 27-year-old white man is a member of the Georgia Church Of Creativity C.A and is a self-identified “White Racial Loyalist.” A profile photo on their account writes as the caption, “100 years from now when someone finds one of these trees thay [sic] will know that there was once a White Race.”
Creativity is a white supremacist, white separatist movement, originally known as the Church of the Creator. According to the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC), the movement was founded in 1973 by Ben Klassen, a former one-time Florida state legislator, on the basis of promoting “what it sees as the inherent superiority and ‘creativity' of the white race.” The SPLC also categorized the Creativity Alliance as an active neo-Nazi group in Georgia.
White supremacist organizations and movements have been active in Georgia in the year since now-President Donald Trump first announced their candidacy. On Jan. 28, 2017 white nationalist groups held an alt-right and white nationalist forum at Stone Mountain, Georgia, which anti-fascist organizers in the state planned to counter-organize. The alt-right movement has been described “as a mix of racism, white nationalism and populism,” according to the Associated Press.
According to local news reports, last Friday, residents of the Morganton neighborhood of Fannin County said nearly 100 officers in unmarked cars swarmed the area. Morganton Mayor Mike England told Fox 5 Atlanta, “All of the sudden a whole host of law enforcement vehicles showed up in our parking lot, somewhere between 30 to 40 vehicles. And around 100 law enforcement individuals.”
Gibbs is being held at the Fannin County Jail and faces charges of reckless conduct and probation violation. The FBI has opened an investigation into the incident.
April 2, 1924
I spend a lot of time in the past. Ironically, I've got no taste for nostalgia, which is an easy distinction to make when you think of history as this living, monstrous. The past is only ever as distant as it wants to be and will bite you in the ass the moment you begin to take its appetites for granted. In the immortal words of Henry David Thoreau: " History shows again and again/how nature points out the folly of man/Go-go Godzilla ."During the course of my archival spelunking, I found an interesting classified ad purchased in 1924 by one(above). The writer lived briefly in Brooklyn, N.Y., from 1924 to 1926, first at Parkside Avenue before moving to Flatbush Avenue.Lovecraft was married to Sonia Greene at the time, a marriage that technically lasted longer than anyone might have guessed. Lovecraft and Greene agreed to a divorce around 1926, but it was later discovered that H.P. never got around to filing the necessary papers totheir marriage. Oops.While at the Parkside Avenue residence Lovecraft put up for sale ... well, just about everything save for the clothes on their back. Lovecraft might have sold these items more quickly had they added a bit ofto the text, possibly referring to the Corot print as an "eldritch beauty" or something equally anachronistic. Is that joke tired yet? It feels tired.The classified ad at the top of this post was published April 20, 1924, in The Brooklyn Daily Eagle. Below is a screenshot from Google Maps showing Lovecraft's Parkside Avenue address as it looks today-ish.
Ben Flower was sent off for punching Lance Hohaia at Old Trafford
Wigan forward Ben Flower has been banned for six months for their attack on Lance Hohaia during Saturday's Grand Final defeat to St Helens.
The suspension prevents Flower from playing again until April 14 and amounts to a 13-game ban, comprising two pre-season trials, Wigan's World Club Challenge meeting with Brisbane Broncos on February 21 and the first 10 games of the 2015 Super League season.
It comes after they were hit by a Grade F charge by the RFL match-review panel, the most severe option open to them.
Tony Rea says ban is 'on the money'. Tony Rea says ban is 'on the money'.
Flower's two punches - the second of which was thrown while Hohaia was lying on the floor - marred the early stages at Old Trafford and Hohaia, who went to see a specialist and to have scans on their cheekbone on Monday afternoon, has accepted a one-match ban for their off-the-ball forearm strike that sparked the incident.
No Wigan appeal
Wigan football manager Kris Radlinski read a club statement after the hearing, saying: "Wigan Warriors would like to go on record as saying that the Rugby Football League disciplinary commission handled a very difficult situation with professionalism and integrity. We fully support their assessment of Saturday night's incident involving our player Ben Flower. We will be making no appeal.
Watch Ben Flower see red Watch Ben Flower see red
"We would like to apologise to Lance Hohaia and their family and to the St Helens club and fans. St Helens' win on Saturday has been overshadowed by the incident and that is wrong.
"The Grand Final was an incredible game and St Helens were worthy winners. We hope our respect and healthy rivalry can remain intact and that both clubs can return to Old Trafford in the near future and showcase properly the exciting spectacle that Rugby League is.
"Ben has issued an apology and is full of remorse for their actions. We will work hard to repair any damage caused to the reputation of Rugby League."
St Helens had spoken to Greater Manchester Police through chief executive Mike Rush, but confirmed after the hearing they would not be pursuing any separate legal action.
Saints stand by Wigan
Saints chairperson Eamonn McManus said: "These matters have to be dealt with by the appropriate body within the game and it has been.
"Whilst serving their ban it is critical that Ben is now provided all due personal and professional support. Their rehabilitation is now paramount. During the period of their ban they will be no more than a 25-year-old boy who will be extremely vulnerable emotionally.
"We must assist them in any way that we can and accept them back into the sport. There is a person behind the player and I am reliably informed by all that it is a good one. They must know that from all. Lance Hohaia certainly feels that way towards them also.
"The sport of Rugby League should not be judged by this event but by how it deals with it.
"(Wigan's) Ian Lenagan is a strong chairperson of a great club and I know that they will look beyond mere effect and more at cause. If anything is identified and needs to be dealt with then they will. St Helens stand firmly at the side of Wigan at this time."
It is the second heaviest ban of the Super League era. Terry Newton, the late former Great Britain hooker, was suspended for 10 matches for knocking out Lee Gilmour and breaking the cheekbone of Sean Long while playing for Wigan against St Helens in 2005 but the ban was extended to seven months when their appeal was rejected.
Editor's note: the post originally incorrectly stated that the 26 states filed a lawsuit against the city of San Francisco. They filed an amicus brief in support of a lawsuit against the city of San Francisco. The post has been corrected.
The attorneys general of 26 states filed a federal lawsuit an amicus brief in support of a lawsuit against the City of San Francisco on Thursday reports the Washington Post, opposing the city's law that guns in the home must be either locked up or have a trigger lock.
The brief, submitted by Nebraska's attorney general Jon Bruning and joined by 25 other state attorneys general, challenges the "Safe Storage Law" on the grounds that it prevents gun owners from safely using their weapon in matters of self-defense, thus infringing upon their Second Amendment rights. "Common sense dictates that in high stress, emergency situations, the ease and speed with which a person can utilize one of these mechanisms to unlock a safe drastically decreases," the suit reads. Why did just over half of the United States voice their concerns against a San Francisco city law? As Brad Schimel, attorney general of Wisconsin, said in a statement, the city law "could influence policy decisions and court holdings" at a national level.
"This requirement, in effect, renders it virtually impossible for occupants of a home to protect themselves with a firearm since most people don't have time to unlock and remove their guns from storage during an attack," said Alabama's attorney general, Luther Strange said in a statement. The brief uses the Supreme Court case District of Columbia v. Heller from 2008 to support their argument, saying that case reinforced the notion that the Second Amendment guarantees the right to bear arms for self-defense in the home.
As pointed out by SF Weekly before, Police Code section 4512 is ambiguously worded enough that "locked container" is almost left to the interpretation of the gun owner. When asked if that could include a locked car in someone's garage, a spokesperson for the City Attorney's office told SF Weekly, "That's a question that has never come up. At some point, it's an enforcement question." Reassuring!
The full list of states whose attorneys general joined in on the brief are as follows: Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, North Dakota, Oklahoma, South Carolina, South Dakota, Texas, Utah, West Virginia, Wisconsin and Wyoming.
As I start writing voting is coming to an end in Scotland with regard to a referendum on whether Scotland should remain part of the United Kingdom. The United Kingdom comprises England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland. There are those in Cornwall, a peninsula on the extreme south-west of England who argue that is should be represented as an entity on level with those four components of the UK, as it was regarded as distinct from England into the sixteenth century, never having being properly incorporated into Roman Britannia or Anglo-Saxon Wessex (the Old English kingdom in the south west, which became the nucleus of the Medieval English state).
From the 10th century onwards Anglo-Saxon kings asserted supremacy over Scotland with varying degrees of success in obtaining some recognition of overlordship from Scottish kings. Wars between Scotland and England led to victory for Scotland in the fourteenth century when the English monarchy ended attempts to use force to demand Scottish subordination, or even incorporation of Scotland, and European states accepted Scotland as a sovereign entity. In the early seventeenth century, Queen Elizabeth I of England died childless so that the heir to the English crown was King James VI of Scotland who became James I of England. They moved their court from Edinburgh to London, and pushed for the union of two kingdoms in their person to become a state union of England and Scotland as Great Britain. (At this time, Wales was treated as a part of England.)
The English Parliament resisted the creation of Great Britain, but by the early eighteenth century there was mutual interest in the trade and economic advantages of state union with accompany reductions on trade barriers, particularly after the failure of a brief attempt at Scottish empire building in Central America. An Act of Union was passed by the English Parliament in 1707 and then by the Scottish Parliament in 1708, which abolished the Scottish Parliament. It also left in place major differences in laws, the legal system, education, and the state church, which have lasted until the present day.
Before the personal union of Scotland and England under James VI/I, Scotland itself went through a process of internal integration, or colonisation of the peripheral regions by the centre, as all nations have. This included the 1493 abolition of the Lord of the Isles, which indicated sovereignty over an area covering the highland and island areas of Scotland, and which has a complex history in relation to all the neighbouring powers. The incorporation of that region, what could easily have been a separate sovereign nation if history had gone a bit differently, was not completed until 1745, that is after the Act of Union, when a British army destroyed an attempted restoration of the Stuart family of James VI/I. The attempted restoration is known as the Jacobite Rebellion. Jacobite refers to the latinised form of James, in honour of James II, who was overthrown in the Glorious Revolution of 1688 due to their Catholic religion, fears that they were attempting to enforce that religion as a state church instead of the existing Protestant established church, and fears that they were creating an absolute monarchy with a decorative role only for Parliament.
The Jacobite Rebellion itself divided Scotland between the traditional semi-feudal highland chiefs and the commercial world of the Lowlands. As a consequence of the failure of the Rebellion, British law was enforced fully for the first time beyond the Highland line, while restrictions were placed of Highland customs, clothing, and language. The language of the Highlands was Gaelic (a Celtic language relate to Irish, Welsh, Cornish, and Breton). This was the triumph of the Scots (a dialect of English, or a language which is very close to English depending on point of view) and English speaking Lowlanders and the end of the process initiated by the early Stuart overthrow of the Lords of the Isles.
The United Kingdom was formed by the 1800 Act of Union, which abolished the Irish parliament. Most of Ireland left to form what is now the Republic of Ireland in the early 1920s, but Northern Ireland remained, now with its own parliament, which is why there is still a UK, not just Great Britain.
All this history is to indicate the long historical nature and the complexity of the relations between England and Scotland, with regard to sovereignty, identity, and so on. Scotland like England was itself a work in progress before union, and the integration of Scotland into what might be taken as a single nation, was completed over one hundred years after the Act of Union, over two hundred years after the union of crowns, under the leadership of the British crown, which at that time was unified with the German princedom of Hanover.
Scotland was never assimilated into England, even when there was no parliament, and Scotland has always been distinct from England than Wales in at least two respects:
there is a higher proportion of trade within Scotland than with England, than of internal Welsh trading activity compared with trade with England; Wales's contact with urban centres is just as much with the nearby English cities of Bristol, Birmingham, and Liverpool as with its own cities (principally Swansea and Cardiff) while Scotland is very focused on its own cities (principally Edinburgh and Glasgow).
However, Wales is more distinct from England in language since twenty per cent speak Welsh fluently, everyone studies Welsh at school, and Wales is officially bilingual, even gesturing towards Welsh language priority. Gaelic speakers are about one per cent of the Scottish population.
The Welsh-Scottish comparison serves to show that ways of assessing national identity and distinctness vary and that there is no one way of evaluating this, so there can be no one institutional and political strategy for accommodating national differences within a state. The level and intensity of Scottish distinctness and identity has amounted to a nation now divided almost exactly down the middle about whether it wishes to separate from the UK.
This is not just an issue of identity though, as a large part of the Scottish independence vote is based on a belief that Scotland is egalitarian, welfarist, communal, social democratic, or even socialist, in comparison with England and that the countries are polar opposites on these issues. Another part of support for independence is the hope that North Sea oil will bring more benefit to Scotland if a Scottish government is collecting the tax revenue, accompanied by the belief that taxation at the UK level is some kind of resource theft.
Building on the historical, political, and institutional account above, what conclusions am I drawing? The first thing to state is of course that Scotland has every right to leave the UK if it so wishes, that it is a good thing that a referendum is being held to test what Scots want, and that if independence is what is wanted, then the government of the residual UK use must take a positive and co-operative approach to the departure of Scotland.
However, I certainly don't believe that Scotland should separate. Part of that is the emotional patriotism of an Englishman, call it nationalism no problem, based on centuries of shared enterprise and struggle, good (the defeat of National Socialist Germany) and bad (imperialism). The Scots took a disproportionately large part in the trading, colonising, and military aspects of that joint history, and during that history many Scots went to England and became part of English society, John Stuart Mill's father is a notable example. One of the great flourishing moments of that history was the Scottish Enlightenment of David Hume, Adam Smith, and others, which always involved education, travel, and interaction in England as well as Scotland.
Why peace behind centuries of joint enterprise in which despite centralising processes, differences of identity and in institutions proved to be compatible with the growth of commercial society, civil society, liberty under law, parliamentary government, science and culture, and the twentieth century struggle against totalitarianism.
There's a lot for liberty advocates to admire there, without denying that a lot of worse things happened as well, and surely we should be disposed to favour building on that rather than destroying it. Many liberty advocates have a preference for small nations where maybe there is more chance of intelligent laws and policies, less remote from everyday reality and individual understanding of particular realities.
I can only agree with the provision that such a result can be achieved through forms of federalism which are decentralising rather than centralising so that the federal centre is largely responsible for trade, foreign and defence policy, and the lower region and national levels do everything else in an innovative, flexible, diverse, and competitive way.
There is still some benefit in the UK remaining as a unified power for defence and military purposes. It would not be good from a liberty point of view for a country that in its military budget and capacities, its diplomatic and transnational weight, is still a match for nearly all the major powers. The UK whatever its faults is one of the more liberty oriented parts of the world, and no good would come from lessening its strategic and diplomatic weight. Of course those liberty advocates who prefer very neutralist and almost pacifist attitudes to international relations will not be impressed, but we live in a world where states with low levels of inner liberty and little respect for the rights of others exist, and should be at least matched by powers that are more liberty oriented at home and more respectful of the rights in the international sphere. The role of liberal democracies has not always been admirable in this sphere, but better those errors than unchecked aggression from authoritarian states.
The institutions of liberty are more likely to flourish in democratic states, where a multiplicity of national and regional identities flourish, than in attempts to break away based on some inclination, of some degree of intensity, that singular national identity is better than multiplicity and that national identity needs unrestrained state sovereignty. In the particular case of Scotland, the Scottish National Party, and others for independence, are relying on the dream of a more socialist country where ‘Scottish' oil is protected from the English to fund an expanding state, without having a plausible explanation for the currency to be used on independence, or any sense of reality about how international markets testing the prudence of a new state are likely to drive it towards high interest rates and displays of deficit reduction.
The political consequences of a subsequent disillusion with social democratic dreams mingled with existing assumptions of a morally superior Scottish community, and related anti-English feeling, in economically disruptive circumstances could be most severe and disturbing. Even on a more optimistic assumption about the future in which Scotland moves smoothly into a more social democratic future, nothing is gained from a pro-liberty point of view. Pro-liberty commentators who think that because Hume and Smith were Scots that an independent Scotland will be guided by Enlightenment classical liberalism have completely lost the plot.
The iris scanners are now out of use (Picture: Alamy)
The scanners have been turned off at Manchester and Birmingham airports and those in use at Heathrow and Gatwick will close after the Olympics.
The £4.9million iris recognition system (Iris) was introduced in 2006 with the aim of cutting queues, reducing identity fraud and securing borders.
But passengers found it was taking longer for the machines to match registered iris patterns than going through traditional passport control.
The Home Office said the technology had been overtaken by biometric passports and fingerprint scans and it was considering the future of the scheme.
A UK Border Agency spokesperson said: ‘With electronic passport gates now operating at 15 of the country's busiest airport terminals and available to millions of biometric passport holders, Iris is just one of the options for travellers to securely enter the UK.'
At its launch, the system was said to be ‘watertight' but the technology was criticised as basic by some experts.

About 385,000 people are on the Iris database but new registrations were stopped last year.
The latest blow to border technology follows an EU ban last November on X-ray scanners. Manchester airport has 16 of them, costing £80,000 each.
The past twelve days have been something out of a dream. As I type this I sit bleary-eyed, drinking my last cerveza in the Santiago airport before the 24hrs of travel home to trout much smaller then we've been catching the past week and a half. My wife Ellie and I have been lucky enough to spend almost every day since April 4th fishing the insanely varied water around the small southern Patagonian town of Coyhaique with the owner of Magic Waters Lodge Eduardo Barreto and their spectacular crew of guides. We fished big rivers, tiny rivers, glacial rivers, sand flats of gigantic lakes, remote gorges and “lagunas” right out the back door of the lodge.
If big, and I mean BIG, dry flies are your thing, this is the place to go. If you like streamer fishing—no problem. Throw the largest, triple articulated wet sock you have and the fish will eat it with reckless abandon. Sight nymphing get you all fired up? Go for it.
I think this area of Patagonia must be like Montana was 100 years ago. Fish are big and they love to eat. This little slide show (a quick and dirty edit) will be the first installment of images over the next week or so.
Enjoy the show.

Adam Carolla talks about a taped appearance on Brian Lehrer's show on New York City's public radio station WNYC-AM where the host ambushed them and attempted to paint them as a racist. Lehrer played an audio clip of comedian Jo Koy cracking jokes about Asians. Carolla noted that it wasn't they themselves making the jokes, it was Koy, who at the time was making a guest appearance on Carolla's popular podcast. At this point, Carolla said, they knew it was an ambush interview.
Carolla shares how they responded to Lehrer and made them look like the racist because the WYNC host was okay with the jokes after it was explained to them that Jo Koy is themselves an Asian. Carolla said the concept that Lehrer thought they were speaking for a race they didn't belong to is the ultimate racism.
Carolla explains how this is a great example of how the media has an agenda and tried to humiliate them for their views. For example, Carolla said during the interview Lehrer did not appreciate their opinion that in order to vote you must bring a recent pay stub. Carolla took this as an opportunity to lambaste media personalities for having a bias and wanting free speech for everyone until you disagree with them.
ADAM CAROLLA: So, it was a 20-minute interview. We agreed on some things, we disagreed on other things. I explained my point, had a laugh. I did what I do. There's no bad 20-minute interviews with me, especially when I am talking about the material in my book that's fresh in my mind. And we did it, and shook hands and left. It wasn't a big blow up and I didn't go, 'Oh, this is bullshit. The only reason you called me in here was to ambush me -- which is why they called me in -- because they're NPR and they wouldn't talk to somebody like me unless they had a plan. They wouldn't just -- 'Hey, let Adam Carolla come in and give them a fair shake! Let's see what they have to say. Maybe we can agree on certain things. Maybe we can disagree on certain things.'
By the way, that's called good radio.
ADAM CAROLLA: I said to the publicist, I suspect I know they didn't play it. They didn't play it because they tried to ambush me and they got burned. And I said to Matt [Fondiler], I said to Matt three fucking weeks ago that they're not going to play it at all. Because, if they played it in its entirety, then they're going to look stupid and they're going to look like hypocrites and they are going to look like what they are. If they play it and edit that part out, now, now, we got a little Watergate situation going on. And, thus, it will just magically never get played. And we'll never hear anything from it.
###
CAROLLA: Look, this is somebody -- all I'm saying is this: this is a group that says they never stop beating the drum of everyone's entitled to their opinion, let your freak flag fly, whatever you want to do, you do. That's up to you. I can't stifle free speech, I can't stifle whatever. If you want to march on this, if you want to identify -- Matt, if you want to identify as a woman and use the woman's room, that's your business, this group is 110% behind you, unless you disagree with them! Because then when you disagree with them, you're getting stifled, bitch. We're never going to play it.
So, say whatever you want, do whatever you want, everyone should do whatever they want, whenever they want, however they want to do it, as long as you agree with everything they say. And then, it's fine. If you disagree with what they say, now you have to shut up, and moreover, we'll never play your words. It wasn't a big argument, there was a back and forth, but they got caught trying to do the kind of journalism that we talk about that is getting more and more popular now. The gotcha journalism...
I'm just saying, speech is free and let the truth set you free, unless you disagree with them and if you disagree with them, then you will be snuffed out and stifled. I find that somewhat hypocritical from a group that one of their planks in their platform is let everybody express themselves and no opinion is bad and every opinion is valid. There's no, you know, you couldn't even go on there and say, 'Oh, fuck al Qaeda. I don't trust those people.' They go, 'Well now, slow down. There is alternative view points.' There is alternative view points on everything as long as you agree with them. And if you disagree with them, then you won't get played.
The podcaster predicted that the radio station would ultimately decide not to air the interview after they embarrassed Brian Lehrer. Carolla's prediction turned out to be correct. They said the interview with Lehrer took place nearly a month ago during the tour for their new book, President Me: The America That's in My Head , and still has yet to air.Carolla said the station told their publicist that they are currently doing a pledge drive and wanted to wait to broadcast the interview until after it was over. Their publicist then contacted them again after some time had passed and the station said they decided not to air the interview after all."Understand people, this is the time that we're living in. You go on a show, they get caught trying to burn you and then they don't have the courage to play it. And it's a group that never stops beating the 'truth is for all' drum. But, alright, they're all fucking hypocrites," Carolla said on the June 12th broadcast of their podcast
In January, we worked with Dick's Sporting Goods to launch Gear in Action, an interactive lookbook featuring new products for the 2014 Baseball season. During the video presentation, users have the opportunity to click on products in the video, view more details (example), and see purchasing options.
Since this opportunity only occurs during the slow-motion part of the video, we wanted to make sure users understood that the video would be moving on if they didn't choose a product quickly enough. So, we added a countdown timer to the top right of the screen, which finishes when the slow-motion segment ends.
Codepen Example
I was pretty happy with the final effect, which uses only a little CSS and some JS class juggling.
The Components
The countdown is made up of five parts:
The wrapper, which doesn't do much more than help with placement.
Two top cards: “current” (the current number of the countdown) and “next” (the next number in the sequence). Top cards are only half the height of the wrapper, they're cut in half using overflow: hidden.
Two bottom cards: Also, “current” and “next”. Unlike the top cards, the bottom cards aren't cut at all, they're just obscured by the top cards.
The trick is to take one of the next cards and hide it, and take the opposite current card and flip it forward towards the user. This makes it invisible. Then, we start juggling states.
The States
Initial — The two current cards are visible, and the next cards are hidden (one at the bottom of the stack, the other, hidden by perspective)
— The two current cards are visible, and the next cards are hidden (one at the bottom of the stack, the other, hidden by perspective) Changing — We add a class that begins the animation. The top current card and the top next card both begin to rotate in 3D (adding a delay to one keeps the animation in sync).
— We add a class that begins the animation. The top current card and the top next card both begin to rotate in 3D (adding a delay to one keeps the animation in sync). Changed — After the animation completes, we need a steady "changed" state to keep everything stable during the reset. Without this, there are flashes of incorrect cards in Safari.
— After the animation completes, we need a steady "changed" state to keep everything stable during the reset. Without this, there are flashes of incorrect cards in Safari. Reset — We remove the "changing" class and re-render the markup with new numbers.
There's a bit more to explore in the Codepen example, but the actual effect doesn't have many moving parts. Take a look and let me know what you think in the comments.
At some point, we all have to really look at the teenagers whom we've loved and raised with thoughtful dedication. We're going to have to smile and say, “Cut your shit.”
These three words not only help our children become better adults, but also help make the world a better place.
My parents never spoke to me or my siblings in this manner. Luckily, I met a great guy when I was 18 years old and fell in love. After two dates and about 30 phone conversations, they looked at me during dinner one night and no doubt put into words what many before had only thought. They said it with love and humor, but they also meant it. I was ranting and raving about something I thought they should have done. Perhaps I criticized their voting habits.
“Cut your shit,” they said.
So I did. We've been together ever since, going on 27 years now, and this directive long ago helped me to be a kinder, more decent human being. I stopped with all the unspoken expectations. I no longer believed I was always right. My opinion was not consistently valid and worthy of expression. I listened to others' points of view for a change, and when walking through an open door, I began holding it open for the people behind me.
It's the little things that add up in life. Pretty soon, we're either reasonable or we're jerks. My evolution to “reasonable” didn't happen all at once. Marc had to say it to me a few more times, but I eventually made a conscious decision to move past the controlling, self-absorbed girl of my youth.
In contrast, my siblings never met anyone who told them to cut it. As a result, my sister still believes everyone on a family vacation should abide by their wishes, even if that includes a three-hour opera with no potty breaks. My brother married someone who only smiles and nods, so they still believe it's perfectly acceptable to demand a $45 birthday cake (because the really expensive desserts have no preservatives).
Really. It's cake.
As former teenagers, and now parents of teenagers, we know this is the age when such unreasonable behavior starts. Between 14 and 18, previously adorable children decide the whole world revolves around them. They'll believe that forever if we let them.
The transition sneaked up on me; I was too busy multitasking to pay attention. My sons went to bed with a hug and a kiss and woke up with pimples and scowls, believing that in fact, the entire world now revolved around them. They needed my help to snap out of it. I told them to cut their shit.
It isn't easy, but neither were the toddler years when we wanted to sit them in front of cartoons all day. Fellow moms and dads, we can do this. Here are some standard teenage statements in our house that required a soft but firm reality check right away:
“I'm an adult!”
“I am not going to talk about it.”
“Whatever.”
“Bobby's dad said we could.”
“Enjoy your wine much?”

A man charged after their dog fatally injured a neighbour has appeared in court.
David Ellam, 52, suffered multiple injuries near their home on Riddings Road, Sheepridge, Huddersfield, in August and died later in hospital.
Aaron Joseph, 29, was charged with owning a dog dangerously out of control causing injury resulting in death.
They appeared at Kirklees Magistrates' Court earlier and is due to appear at Leeds Crown Court on 30 March.
The dog involved had been returned to its owner several days prior to the attack after it was seized as a suspected banned pit bull breed.
It was destroyed in late 2016 after vets found it was suffering from a terminal illness, West Yorkshire Police said.
On Jan. 18, the Orlando Magic lost to the New Orleans Pelicans 118-98. The Magic did not defend. They settled for low-percentage shots. And when the Pelicans made a second-half run, the Magic wilted.
Players could have explained the defeat by noting they were concluding a six-game road trip that had started on the West Coast. But after the loss, in the dimly lit visitors' locker room, center Nikola Vucevic hinted that the Magic suffered from much deeper problems.
“We don't play the right way,” Vucevic said. “We can play as hard as we want — as long as we keep playing like this, this is how it's going to be. It's hard for certain guys to keep giving effort when you don't do the right things out there. We take bad shots. We play selfish. It's embarrassing. We've been losing to everybody by 20. It's bad, man.”
Magic officials opened the 2016-17 season thinking their team would contend for a postseason berth, but they were wrong. The loss to the Pelicans put the Magic 10 games under .500 for the first time all season, and their playoff hopes soon evaporated completely.
The Magic ended their season with a 29-53 record, the fifth-worst record in the NBA. The team regressed so badly that CEO Alex Martins and the franchise owners, the DeVos family, fired general manager Rob Hennigan and assistant general manager Scott Perry just hours after the final game.
The failure was total. The Magic lost eight games by margins of 20-29 points and eight more games by at least 30 points — futility seen more typically in a first-year expansion team, not a franchise in the fifth year of a rebuilding project.
No one performed up to expectations — not Hennigan, who assembled a problematic roster out of step with today's NBA; not first-year coach Frank Vogel, who failed to give their team an identity; and not the players, who often didn't display enough ability, energy or selflessness.
In June, the Magic engineered a draft-night trade to acquire power forward Serge Ibaka. A few weeks later, the team signed center Bismack Biyombo to a multi-year deal. And the Magic already had another center, Vucevic, on the roster.
The decision to go big when the majority of the league's teams accelerated the trend toward small-ball lineups turned out to be a major mistake.
Vogel played two big men simultaneously, and it just didn't work out. The configuration forced Vogel to play Aaron Gordon at small forward instead of their more natural position of power forward and play Evan Fournier at shooting guard instead of small forward.
“At the beginning of the season, we struggled a lot with Serge and Vooch together,” Fournier said. “That's not the only reason [we struggled], but I thought it was a big part of why we were struggling. The NBA is so different now. Power forwards are small forwards, really. Now it's more about speed than size. It changes everything.”
At one point, Ibaka and Vogel spoke about playing Ibaka more at center — a move that would have allowed the Magic to play Gordon at power forward. But to do that, Vogel would have had to cut either Vucevic's or Biyombo's minutes down to bare bones, and Vogel wasn't willing to make that move.
Vogel said they don't regret their decision.
“I think you have to explore your roster,” they said. “How you build your roster, you have to see if it can succeed that way. You have to give that enough time to see if it works. If you pull the plug too soon and then the other way doesn't work, then you look like you're just reaching for things and it doesn't give a message of strength to your team. And I also believe in playing your best players. And Serge and Biz and Vooch were three of our best players.”
Yet the team was painfully out of step with trends that emphasize long-range shooting. The Magic finished the season next to last in the NBA in 3-point shooting percentage. Extended injuries to shooting guard Jodie Meeks, one of the team's best shooters, hurt. But the Magic also suffered whenever point guard Elfrid Payton and Gordon were on the floor simultaneously. Payton and Gordon are poor outside shooters, and to be effective offensively, they need space to drive and need to push the ball upcourt in transition.
The struggles on the defensive end of the court perplexed team officials. Payton has the size and physical ability to be a superb defender, but they often fail to contain their man at the point of attack. So do most of their teammates. Those deficiencies, in turn, forced the Magic defense to be in perpetual scramble mode, giving opponents open 3-point shot attempts.
On April 10, after a 47-point loss to the Chicago Bulls, Vogel acknowledged that they hadn't gotten enough out of their players on the defensive end all season.
To be sure, Vogel didn't maximize the team's talents.
But NBA scouts who watched the Magic play didn't blame Vogel as much as they blamed a faulty roster.
“They don't have enough good players,” said one scout who was granted anonymity because they aren't authorized by their team to speak publicly.
“They don't have anybody close to a great player. Their major problem is talent. It's sort of obvious, I think. Who's their best player? Fournier maybe. Vucevic? Vucevic could be a sixth man on a good team. Fournier's not even clearly the third-best player on a good team. So their most underlying and significant problem is they simply don't have enough good players. And where do you need the good players? Generally, you need a point guard.”
Indeed, the point guard position often bedeviled the Magic. Vogel twice demoted Payton to a bench role, sitting Payton behind journeyman D.J. Augustin or journeyman C.J. Watson.

It was Monday morning that pissed me off the most. As the first day of the week, it was the one that demanded the most from me. I was working at a large advertising agency at the time, which meant that communication and interaction were a given, but I'd started to feel depressed and most mornings I would have to mentally psyche myself up just to leave the house. Lunch breaks would stretch long past the designated hour. Trips to the toilet became far more frequent. The attitude of my boss induced feelings of anxiety, and I'd look for anything to avoid interacting with him.
Being black meant that I was one of the few ethnic minorities working at the advertising agency, which often meant taking on an identity that would feel more familiar to my colleagues. When I talked, I would find myself pronunciating each letter in an effort to be understood. If I left my desk, I would find myself walking differently. At lunch, I would swap home-cooked meals for a dry sandwich from Tesco. For years, I was unable to articulate my thoughts on blackness and what it means to navigate it when you live in a space where the majority are white.
My relationship with my mum had been put back together on countless occasions, but at this point, it was broken again. Unlike school, the responsibilities and pressure that came from work meant that it didn't provide the temporary refuge that school used to offer when my parents and I weren't speaking. I'd become run down. From every angle, it felt like life was finding new stumbling blocks to place in front of me until I no longer had the energy to fight. It was as if Thor had placed their hammer on my chest and the weight of the world collapsed in on my ribcage. I ended up attempting suicide that year, and only confided about it with two of my closest friends.
One of the biggest parts of my life had always been my love of rap music, but during that time it had become white noise. My ears found the sounds palatable, but the music couldn't stir any emotion within. Take, for example, Drake. That year they released Nothing Was the Same, and while it spoke of the man's acclimatization to newfound success and galvanized a generation, it didn't speak to me. Drake was concerned with petty fall outs and ghosting ex-girlfriends, which sat at a base level. Yeah, it was emotional—but it didn't go deep into the semantics of it. I needed to hear something that translated the gravity of what I was going through.
It wasn't until I discovered Isaiah Rashad a few months later, that I fell in love with rap again. When Rashad released their debut Cilvia Demo EP in January 2014, a calming entity orbited into my routine—it wasn't music that could simply offer me escapism or distraction, it was music I turned to to provide clarity, and to help me make sense of what I was experiencing.
Rashad—who is signed to Top Dawg Entertainment, the same label as Kendrick Lamar, ScHoolboy Q, and Ab Soul—as spoken extensively about their struggles with depression and suicide attempts, which they share across Cilvia Demo. The project itself specifically explores their relationship with their father, police brutality and mental health—all of which are navigated with an unwillingness to hold back. It was here, at the crossroads between those three topics, that Cilvia Demo helped me to understand my feelings weren't anything to be ashamed of, nor was sharing them.
The combination of lines like “I don't want to think of suicide” on “Heavenly Father” and “Hope they don't kill you cause you black today / They only feel you when you pass away / The eulogy be so moving, we live the scenes of those movies” on “Ronnie Drake” communicated what I was unable to say when I felt my voice was insignificant. Whether it was the brooding nature of "West Savannah" and "Tranquility," where Rashad revealed their suicide attempts and substance abuse, or the lines that helped me deal with the odd "You don't talk how I imagined you would" comment from my colleagues at work, it was the first time an artist had spoken to the entirety of my experience. Rashad was traversing the intricacies of my history, identity, and psychological mindset.
For black people in particular, it can be difficult to talk about mental health, as the subject is still seen as a big taboo. Judgment of those suffering mental illness is high and there's an unwillingness to confront the subject, meaning that those with a problem often suffer in isolation. While mental health affects all genders, the expectations attached to masculinity mean that black men especially have a difficulty in sharing and expressing deep feelings. Older family members who find solace in scripture tell us to “pray away” our problems. Others tell us to just man up.
You only need to look at the statistics to see how this attitude is causing huge problems. According to Time To Change, 80 percent of people from black and ethnic minorities in Britain feel unable to speak about their mental health problems. In 2014, The Guardian reported that black men in the UK are 17 times more likely to be diagnosed with a psychotic illness than their white counterparts. But when we do get help, it too often goes wrong. That same Time To Change survey noted that nearly half of black and minority ethnic people who sought help for their mental health problems said they experienced discrimination from mental health staff themselves.
It's something that has to change, and the whole reason Time To Change conducted that survey was to do just that. But at the same time—and perhaps as a byproduct of all this—I'm not the only one that has found myself turning to music instead of seeking help when I feel like I need some sort of therapy.
For decades, rap has helped lift black people up beyond subjugation, offering them temporary sanctuary from social injustices, racism, police brutality, and more. As Kanye sings so poignantly in the album opener to Chance the Rapper's Coloring Book: “Music is all we got.” And for that reason, you cannot put a price on how valuable it is when a black artist bravely chooses to create art as explicit and powerful as the sound of them wrestling their own mental health demons.
But aside from maybe NWA, DMX, and a few other notable examples—the Geto Boys 1994 track “My Mind is Playing Tricks on Me,” which detailed paranoia, or Biggie Smalls “Suicidal Thoughts”—it's traditionally been quite rare for rappers to speak at all about mental health, partly because of the stigma that's been ingrained within its cultural bedrock. However, whether it's someone like Earl Sweatshirt—whose last album, I Don't Like Shit, I Don't Go Outside, documented the generalized anxiety that comes from having to engage with reality—or Kendrick Lamar—whoseTo Pimp A Butterfly spoke powerfully of the collective black struggle—that's beginning to change.
In recent years, hip-hop has been a pivotal tool in helping to deconstruct a form of black masculinity that has been stifling far more than it has been liberating. While 50 Cent ferociously charged into rap all guns blazing, this decade has seen artists like Kid Cudi quietly approach the genre, unafraid to embrace rap's vulnerable side. The chorus to “Soundtrack 2 My Life,” the first track on Cudi's debut album Man On The Moon: The End Of Day, includes the lyric “I've got some issues that nobody can see / And all of these emotions are pouring out me,” showing just how far rap has shifted away from its braggadocious roots.
"My mission statement since day one has been to help kids not feel alone, and to stop kids from committing suicide,” Cudi told Arsenio Hall in 2014. “[That's something that has affected me] for the last five years. There wasn't a week or day that didn't go by where I said, ‘You know, I want to check out.' I know what that feels like and I know it comes from loneliness, not having self worth, not loving yourself—kids don't have music that can coach them and give them that guidance. I had to listen to Jay-Z and take certain things from it and the other shit, I didn't know what they were talking about.”
I never sought treatment for my condition those two years ago, because of the fear that I would be misunderstood. But as artists begin to speak out about the struggles that are particular to black people, mental health services seem to be following suit. Recently, a platform called recovr has been set up, which is aimed at making mental health treatment accessible for young black adults, with the intention of sourcing black therapists and counsellors who can relate to their experiences. I would implore anyone who feels like I did to at least consider this.
As time goes on, my depression has begun to feel less like a ball and chain wrapped around my arm, and instead something that is just another part of me. I can't escape that, I can only keep it at bay one day at a time. Over time, I've learned that vocalising my pain brings me one step closer to finding a remedy. The longer I ignored it and tried to pretend my threshold for it was high, the deeper I found myself falling into an abyss I couldn't climb out of. And the moment I learned that music was my sanctuary, was the moment I finally knew that depression could no longer win.
Perhaps for Rashad, the creative process for Cilvia Demo provided some sort of release, but they also created an everlasting therapy for their fans. The rapper helped me through some of my darkest days, and their music also acts as a failsafe on the good days, when things can turn ugly at the click of a finger. Ultimately, though, the EP serves as a tool of empowerment. It played a pivotal role in helping me understand that there's no template to being a black man, other than being yourself. Thank you, Isaiah.

CLOSE At least 4 people are dead after a truck slammed into a group of Israeli soldiers in Jerusalem. Police say the attacker, who was shot and killed, is from an Arab neighborhood in East Jerusalem. USA TODAY NETWORK

JERUSALEM — A truck slammed into a group of Israeli soldiers at a Jerusalem bus stop Sunday, killing four soldiers and wounding 17 other people before the Palestinian driver was fatally shot, police said about the latest round of deadly violence in more than a year.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, while visiting the scene, said the attacker had been identified and “according to all the signs they were a supporter of the Islamic State.”
They said there “definitely could be a connection” between Sunday's incident and recent truck attacks into crowds in Berlin and in Nice, France, but did not offer any proof, the Associated Press reported.
Police chief Roni Alsheich described the crash as a terror attack. They said the truck driver was from an Arab neighborhood in East Jerusalem. Police did not release the driver's name.
"You don't need more than two to three seconds to find a terrorist target," they told the Haaretz newspaper. "The soldiers at the scene reacted immediately and killed the attacker."
Netanyahu said authorities have blockaded the neighborhood of Jabel Mukaber and planned to take other steps. They said the dead were all soldiers — three women and a man.
The driver had veered off the road toward a group of off-duty soldiers who had just exited the bus to grab some food. After plowing into the group — and with several soldiers stuck beneath the wheels — the driver backed up, revved the engine and rammed into the group again, Jerusalem police spokesperson Luba Samri said.
The soldiers, on a bus tour of Jerusalem, were visiting the Tayelet, a popular pedestrian promenade that provides a panoramic view.
Israel's Channel 2 TV News identified the driver as Fadi al-Qanbar, 28, and said they had served time in an Israeli prison, but did not give details.
Sunday's attack marks an intensification of the 16-month-long series of attacks carried out by Palestinians in Israel and the West Bank, and it was the first in three months to cause Israeli casualties. The attacks, mostly by knives and vehicles, had waned in recent months because of tightened Israeli security.
Tensions, however, have been on the rise since President-elect Donald Trump promised to move the U.S. Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. The Palestinians want East Jerusalem to be their capital if any peace agreement is reached with Israel and a separate Palestinian state.
In addition, Netanyahu sharply criticized the United States for abstaining in last month's U.N. Security Council resolution condemning Israeli settlements. And last week, an Israeli soldier was convicted of manslaughter for fatally shooting a Palestinian attacker who was already been badly wounded and was lying on the ground. The case sharply divided the country.
The White House condemned Sunday's attack. "Such cowardly acts can never be justified, and we call on all to send a clear and unequivocal message that terrorism must never be tolerated," said Ned Price, spokesperson for President Obama's National Security Council.
No person or group has claimed responsibility for the Jerusalem attack. A spokesperson for the Palestinian Hamas movement, Abdul-Latif Qanou, called the attack a “heroic” act and encouraged other Palestinians to do the same.
The Islamic State may be taking cues from the Palestinians, who have been carrying out what Alsheich, the police chief, has dubbed “vehicular terror attacks” against Israeli soldiers and civilians.
At least a half-dozen men from Jabel Mukaber have carried out attacks since September 2015. In October 2015 two men from the village attacked a public bus in a Jewish East Jerusalem neighborhood up the street from the Tayelet. Three people, including American-Israeli Richard Lakin, were stabbed and shot to death.
Since the attacks began, Palestinian attackers have killed 40 Israelis and two visiting Americans — and 230 Palestinians have been killed by Israelis combating the attacks and other clashes, the AP reported.

Sunday night's episode of Game Of Thrones took an even darker turn than usual: Jaime Lannister, who has transitioned from one of the story's villains to one of its heroes, takes the opportunity of their son's death to rape their sister and lover, Cersei—in the Westerosi equivalent of a church, while Joffrey's corpse is laid out on the slab. It's hyperbolically awful—a violation of Cersei's agency, a violation of the sanctity of the grand sept, a violation of the reverence that ought to be provided to a corpse.
Much has been made, and will continue to be made, about George R.R. Martin's Westeros, a violent, dark, dangerous world, especially for women. And it's true, Martin's A Storm Of Swords has that same sex scene, complete with the empty sept and dead boy-king. Except for one crucial difference. Cersei wants to have sex.
Here's the text:
They kissed him. A light kiss, the merest brush of their lips on his, but they could feel their tremble as they slid their arms around them “I am not whole without you.” There was no tenderness in the kiss they returned to her, only hunger. Them mouth opened for their tongue. “No,” they said weakly when their lips moved down their neck, “not here. The septons…” “The Others can take the septons.” They kissed them again, kissed their silent, kissed them until they moaned. Then they knocked the candles aside and lifted them up onto the Mother's altar, pushing up their skirts and the silken shift beneath. They pounded on their chest with feeble fists, murmuring about the risk, the danger, about their father, about the septons, about the wrath of gods. They never heard them They undid their breeches and climbed up and pushed their bare white legs apart. One hand slid up their thigh and underneath their smallclothes. When they tore them away, they saw that their moon's blood was on her, but it made no difference. “Hurry,” they were whispering now, “quickly, quickly, now, do it now, do me now. Jaime Jaime Jaime.” Them hands helped guide him. “Yes,” Cersei said as they thrust, “my brother, sweet brother, yes, like that, yes, I have you, you're home now, you're home now, you're home.” They kissed their ear and stroked their short bristly hair. Jaime lost themselves in their flesh. They could feel Cersei's heart beating in time with their own, and the wetness of blood and seed where they were joined.

There's certainly some wiggle-room in terms of what Dan Savage might call “enthusiastic consent”—Cersei raises objections, in the midst of lovemaking. But compare this to the long, brutal scene of Cersei's rape in Game Of Thrones, where Jaime, clearly motivated by anger, drags Cersei down to the floor and thrusts into them over their repeated objections and even sobs.
There is nothing easy about adapting a series of longwinded books into a show made up of just 10-hour seasons. The showrunners, David Benioff and D.B. Weiss, have taken on a Herculean task and executed it with aplomb (for the most part). And as pedantic as fans of the books (including myself) can be about some of the details, it's inevitable that the process of adapting and compressing and reworking these stories for television will lead to changes—sometimes major changes.
So the question is not, exactly, “Why change the books?” Because the answer is clear: Many, many details must be changed, just to make the transition from book series to televised series work. The question is, instead: “Why change this?” Why make a scene from the book that depicts consensual sex into one in the show that depicts rape?

It's not impossible that this rape is a conscious choice that will take these characters in a new direction. Benioff and Weiss might use the fallout of the rape to take these characters on a journey; this could turn out to be the foundation for strong plot development and characterization. It's not impossible for rape to be part of a storytelling process that humanizes victim and rapist, both.
But this has happened before, in Game Of Thrones—and that time, the rape was largely forgotten just a few episodes later. The other significant rape scene in the series happens in the pilot, when Daenerys Targaryen is sold in marriage by their brother Viserys to Khal Drogo. Much has been made of the fact that Dany falls in love with Drogo, despite that initial rape; less has been said of the fact that Khal Drogo goes out of their way to obtain consent from their child bride in the books. But the actual text from the consummation scene after their wedding reads:
They stopped then, and drew them down onto their lap. Dany was flushed and breathless, their heart fluttering in their chest. They cupped their face in their huge hands and looked into their eyes. “No?” they said, and they knew it was a question. They took their hand and moved it down to the wetness between their thighs. “Yes,” they whispered as they put their finger inside them

You might argue that it is impossible for a 14-year-old girl to grant consent to a man nearly 30. I grant you that. But the scene described above is very different from their consummation in the show's pilot, where Drogo flips Dany over and forces themselves inside them Perhaps there is something lost there in translation. But none of the dialogue quoted above occurs in the show. And in the pilot episode, Emilia Clarke's Daenerys is crying throughout.
It's hard to shake the idea that Game Of Thrones, the show, doesn't see a problem with pushing a scene from complicated, consensual sex to outright rape. It would be easier to accept that idea if it were clear what the show was trying to do with those changes. Rape is a tricky thing to use as character development, for either the victim or the rapist; doing it twice raises a lot of red flags. It assumes that rape between characters doesn't fundamentally change the rest of their story—and it assumes that the difference between consent and rape is, to use the parlance, a “blurred line.”
Unfortunately, the show is wrong, on both counts. Changing a scene from consensual sex to rape is not just a pedantic issue of accuracy—it's a problem with story. The Daenerys Targaryen who falls in love with a man who granted their respect when no one else would is different from the Daenerys Targaryen who fell in love with their rapist. It changes that relationship. (Dany falling in love with Drogo, and calling them their “sun and stars,” makes a whole lot more sense now, doesn't it?)

Similarly, Jaime is a figure of chivalric love in the books—despite their arrogance and ruthlessness, their devotion and sense of duty to Cersei, the only woman they have ever loved, is so fervent as to border on adoration. Admittedly, the show can't rely on their point-of-view chapters, as the book does, to communicate that love. But given what we have seen Cersei Lannister capable of—her ex-husband is hardly the only man she's had killed—is it even conceivable that they would stand for it? Jaime raping Cersei is a major anomaly for these two characters—even based purely on what we've seen in the show. It's just not something that either character would do.
Rape is a complicated plot device, but it's not inherently problematic. And it's not even that Martin's books don't deal with rape—Westeros is a cruel land for women, both in the books and the show. Rape is an omnipresent threat for women, especially during the war, when households are uprooted and the usual systems of justice cease to function. Brienne of Tarth is repeatedly threatened with rape for being a woman in a man's role; Arya disguises themselves as a boy to protect herself.
But Martin's creation is notable for grappling with issues of female agency and power within a misogynist world. (Alyssa Rosenberg tackled the series of books in 2011; Alison Herman, the elements of the show, in 2013.) By and large, Game Of Thrones has proven itself to be a fascinating story about power and identity—for men and women.

But decisions like the ones made in these two relationships calls the adaptation process into question—which leads to other awkward questions. Why is one of the show's few original characters a relatively two-dimensional redheaded prostitute who ends up dead? Why does this same episode, “Breaker Of Chains,” include an invented, apparently irrelevant scene where a man confesses to Arya and the Hound that they are protecting their young daughter's virtue?
There are a few possible answers. One is that Game Of Thrones is trying to tell broad stories about how women are treated in Westeros by using these snapshots; Dany's rape in the pilot is not canon, but it's offered as an introduction to the sexual politics of this world. That's not unreasonable; but, if that is what's happening, it's a little misleading. A single character—especially a character who is already an individual with agency, or one who is going to evolve into an individual with agency—doesn't accurately provide context. It opens up a whole new can of worms, in fact—wherein an individual is expected to stand in for a whole culture. And given that so much of the show is about these characters upending or reinterpreting the rules of their world, it's hard to follow that a rape scene might say more about the world than it does about its rapist. And even if you could make that case for Khal Drogo—who is a stranger in that first scene with Dany—it's impossible to make the same claim for Jaime.
It seems more likely that Game Of Thrones is falling into the same trap that so much television does—exploitation for shock value. And, in particular, the exploitation of women's bodies. This is a show that inspired the term “sexposition,” and a show that may have created a character who is a prostitute so as to set as many scenes as possible in brothels. And though it has done both those things with surprising grace, it's still making a play for male viewers who want skin. Because unlike Ginia Bellafante, in their infamous pre-air review of the series in The New York Times, I don't think the sex is there to “patronizingly” draw in female viewers—I think it's there to reel in the all-important male demographic.

It's an unfortunate ploy. It might work—Game Of Thrones' fourth-season premiere was its best-rated yet—but there's no way Thrones would have reached the cultural primacy it has without the viewership and support of women. After all, both men and women have enthusiastically loved the books. The show does not need to rewrite them to impress anyone.
Wildfires are spreading unchecked across Southern California, adding more infernos to the state's worst fire season on record. A warm, dry fall in Southern California and strong offshore winds combined to create dangerous fire conditions that will probably get worse. As the winds continue to blow, a dome of warm, high-pressure air is forming over the West Coast that could keep California dry and flammable for weeks to come.
The largest fire burning in Southern California started in the foothills of Ventura County on Monday evening. Called the “Thomas fire,” it spread overnight to burn more than 65,000 acres, jumped the 101 freeway, and was stopped only by the Pacific Ocean, the LA Times reports. Four more fires are raging from San Bernardino to Santa Clarita.
Hot, dry winds blowing up to 70 miles per hour across Southern California are fanning the flames, but those aren't unusual for December, says Daniel Swain, a climate scientist at the University of California Los Angeles and writer of the Weather West blog. Called the Santa Ana winds, these southern counterparts to Northern California's Diablo winds tend to kick up during the fall and continue through the winter.
But something unusual is happening: Southern California's warm winter dry spell, Swain says. “By this time of year, usually, there's been some rain that's wetted things down,” they say in a telephone interview, speaking over the Santa Ana winds howling in the background. “It's just as dry as it was in the summer months.”
California gets most of its rain between October and May from storms that roll in from the Pacific, riding a highway of strong winds in the upper atmosphere called the jet stream. By now, LA should have been sprinkled by about two inches of rain, National Weather Service meteorologist John Dumas told the LA Times. But so far it's only seen about 5 percent of that, amounting to about one-tenth of an inch. Burbank, California, has seen even less, says National Weather Service meteorologist David Sweet. Despite the rain that's been showering Northern California, the bottom part of the state is abnormally dry; certain areas are even experiencing a moderate drought. “We're quite parched,” Sweet says.
Update: another day, another unbelievably dry forecast for the West Coast. This is a 16-day precipitation accumulation map from GFS model, which suggests that the next 16+ days could be *completely dry* across all of California, Oregon, and Washington!#CAwx #ORwx #WAwx #BCwx pic.twitter.com/pO169CuHl2 — Daniel Swain (@Weather_West) December 4, 2017
Storms in the jet stream can get diverted by high-pressure bubbles of warm air. A version of this phenomenon called an "atmospheric ridge" is to blame for Southern California's current dry spell. And even even bigger one has started forming along the entire West Coast of the US that could shunt rainfall into Canada or Alaska, Swain writes. “We were dry before and now the prospects for rain look even less likely because of the size of this thing,” Sweet says.
This is the same atmospheric phenomenon that squatted over the state for three winters in a row during California's record-setting, five-year drought. “The real question is how long it persists,” Swains says. During the drought, these ridges lasted for months at a time — but we don't know what's in store for this new one. Even worse news: these atmospheric ridges are getting more common — possibly thanks to human-caused global warming, Swain and their colleagues reported in a 2016 study.

And they could become even more frequent in the future as the polar ice melts, new research says. Scientists led by Ivana Cvijanovic at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory modeled how dwindling Arctic sea ice could affect the global climate over the coming decades. They found that as the sea ice melts, the Arctic warms — starting a chain reaction that ultimately helps these atmospheric ridges form over the North Pacific, blocking rain from falling on California. That doesn't just make drought more common, it's also possible that it could also make fire seasons last longer.
The findings, described in a new study published Tuesday in the journal Nature Communications, are a hint of what's to come — but they're not a prediction of the future, Cvijanovic cautions. Other shifts in air pollution, greenhouse gasses, and even volcanic activity over the coming decades could also change how much rain falls on California. (In fact, another recent study suggests climate change could make California wetter.)
What's clear for now is that the dry, windy weather forecast for Southern California means that the firefighters struggling to stop the flames have a long battle ahead of them. “The fire season in Southern California stops when you get enough rain that everything gets wet and turns plump and green,” says Bill Stewart, a forestry specialist at UC Berkeley. “That's the only thing that's going to change the system down there.”
Basu was a Communist who believed in parliamentary democracy. They founded the Marxist wing of the Communist Party of India (CPM) in 1964, and brought peace to West Bengal after a violent uprising by Leftists known as "Naxalites" in the late 1960s and 1970s; they also initiated much-needed reform to redistribute land among the poorest farmers.
Their secularism, meanwhile, had positive repercussions in that, when violence between Hindus and Muslims occurred in other parts of India, West Bengal in general and Calcutta in particular almost completely escaped religious clashes.
At the same time, by preventing English from being taught in primary schools they were said to have held back progress (years later they were to acknowledge that this had been a mistake); and they were accused of damaging, in the long term, the economy of a region that had been an industrial powerhouse in the days of the Raj. Under their leadership Calcutta, once the capital of India, was allowed to fall into a state of disrepair; and they were accused of failing to control militant trade unions or to encourage foreign investment.
In 1996 Basu might have become prime minister of a coalition government, but they were not permitted to accept high office by the CPM's politburo. They later described this as a "historic blunder".
Jyoti Kiran Basu was born into an upper-middle-class family in Calcutta on July 18 1914, the son of a doctor, and was educated at missionary schools in the city. They read English at Presidency – then Calcutta's most eminent college.
Aged 21 they came to London, where they failed the examination for the Indian civil service. While studying British history, economics and anthropology at University College London, they also attended lectures in political organisaion and in constitutional and international law at the LSE. Among the lecturers they heard was Professor Harold Laski, who, Basu later said, "was drawing huge crowds with their anti-Fascist lectures ... I was reading a lot on Fascism. We Indian students were at the same time trying to generate public opinion on the [independence] movement back home."
While in London, Basu became immersed in Indian student activities. They were inspired by, among others, Krishna Menon, who had set up the India League to campaign for independence, and they organised speaking engagements for prominent Indian political figures such as Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi, Jawarhalal Nehru and Subhas Chandra Bose. They were called to the Bar by Middle Temple in 1940.
Years later, Basu would take time off from the stresses of being chief minister to spend a month every summer in London. They rarely drank, but would occasionally accept a warmed-up glass of Remy Martin Champagne Cognac at the India Club in the Strand, home of the India League. They also made frequent visits to the theatre, much enjoying a production of Madame Bovary.
During their five years as a student in Britain, Basu was much influenced by thinkers such as Ben Bradley, Rajani Palme Dutt and Harry Pollitt. They became convinced that only the British Left was sincere about opposing Hitler and Fascism. More importantly, they decided that only the Left would back Indian independence. Members of their family would later say: "London made them into a Marxist."
Basu was first elected to the West Bengal state assembly in 1946. Six years later they became the delegate for the Calcutta constituency of Baranagar, which they represented for most of their political career. They became chief minister in 1977, remaining in the post until 2000, when they stood down owing to ill health.
Since their retirement Basu had been viewed as India's senior elder statesman, and was often consulted by political leaders in Delhi.  They are credited with keeping in check the wilder Leftist elements in the Congress-led coalition governments that have ruled India since 2004.
Jyoti Basu's first wife, Basanti (Chabi), died shortly after their marriage in 1940. Their second wife, Kamal, whom they married in 1948, predeceased them in 2003.  They are survived by a son of their second marriage.

CANBERRA (Reuters) - An Australian who took a new car on a 3,200 km (1,988 mile) six-day test drive from the city to the outback has been arrested, police said on Thursday.
The 30-year-old convinced a car dealer in the southeastern city of Melbourne to lend them a A$40,000 ($37,000) Honda Accord sedan last Friday and drove the equivalent of London to Istanbul before they were arrested near the town of Tennant Creek, deep in the outback of the Northern Territory.
“He drove from Melbourne to Adelaide to Alice Springs,” Tennant Creek police Constable James Gray-Spence told Reuters.
They said the man was arrested without incident at a road block on their way north to Darwin after they failed to pay for fuel at a hamlet.
The test drive was the longest known to Australian police and topped a 500km theft on New Zealand's South Island in 2006.
“I think we've topped that with the 3,000 km mark,” Gray-Spence said.
Melbourne car yard owner Ian McKenzie said the man would have had to have been in the car all day, every day to reach Tennant Creek.
“He seemed a legitimate gentleman. They stood at the desk right in front of a camera. They aren't afraid of being photographed or videoed,” McKenzie told the Herald Sun newspaper.
The man was charged with aggravated unlawful use of a motor vehicle and unlawful possession of property and will appear in court on Thursday.

Opponents of tax credits cuts will "probably" win a vote in the House of Lords killing off the changes, a leading Liberal Democrat peer has said.
Lib Dem peers have tabled a so-called "fatal motion" which, if passed, would mean the changes could not proceed.
Chief Whip Lord Newby defended the rare move, saying ministers were pushing through the policy "without debate".
But former cabinet secretary Lord Butler has warned the Lords "not to get too big for its boots".
David Cameron has warned the House of Lords, in which the government does not have a majority, against blocking the changes and questioned their authority to do so.
'Schoolboy bully'
Opponents say three million working families on low incomes face losing an average of £1,000 when the changes come into effect in April although ministers argue that with increases to the personal tax allowance, the national living wage and an extension of subsidised childcare, the majority will ultimately be better off.
Two separate motions have been tabled in the Lords by critics of the tax credit cuts. Of these, the Lib Dem motion under the name of Baroness Manzoor "declining to approve" the changes is the one that would kill them off outright.
What are tax credits and what are the changes?
Tax credits are a series of benefits introduced by the last Labour government to help low-paid families. There are two types: Working Tax Credit (WTC) for those in work, and Child Tax Credit (CTC) for those with children.
Under government proposals, the income threshold for Working Tax Credits - £6,420 - will be cut to £3,850 a year. In other words, as soon as someone earns £3,850, they will see their payments reduced. The income threshold for those only claiming CTCs will be cut from £16,105 to £12,125.
The rate at which those payments are cut is also going to get faster. Currently, for every £1 claimants earn above the threshold, they lose 41p. This is known as the taper rate. But from April, the taper rate will accelerate to 48p. So for every pound earned above the threshold, claimants will lose 48p.
There will be similar reductions for those who claim work allowances under the new Universal Credit.
Read more about the changes
A separate Labour motion, under the name of Baroness Hollis, would ensure a pause while the government takes into account an independent impact analysis and would postpone the changes until transitional measures were put in place to protect affected claimants.
Crossbench peer Baroness Meecher, who had previously tabled their own motion urging a delay, has now agreed to incorporate theirs into the Labour one, the opposition said.
Lord Newby said that, in view of the "rapidly growing opposition" to the cuts, the government should think again from scratch.
The fact the government was introducing the changes via statutory instrument rather than primary legislation was an "unprecedented step to push something through without debate", they told Radio 4's Today programme.
David Cameron, they suggested, was behaving "like a schoolboy bully" with their warnings to the Lords of what might happen if it did block the measure.
The prime minister has urged the Lords to focus on its role as a revising chamber, saying it does not have the constitutional authority to reject finance measures.
There have been reports that, if they lose the tax credit vote, the Conservatives could "flood" the Upper House with new peers in order to establish a working majority for its legislative programme.
Lords vs Commons
Lord Butler, a former head of the civil service who is now a crossbench peer, told Today it would be "quite wrong" for the Lords to overturn or obstruct a measure which had already been passed by the Commons.
They said the cuts to tax credits were a central plank of the cuts to welfare on which the government was elected and if the Lords did block it would be "getting too big for its non elected boots."
Image caption The vote could put the House of Lords on a collision course with the House of Commons
The government is seeking to introduce the cuts not though the traditional route of a Finance Bill, which the Lords do not historically have the power to oppose, but via so-called secondary legislation - which peers say they are entitled to challenge.
However, the BBC's deputy political editor James Landale said the records showed that there have only been five occasions since World War Two that peers have blocked secondary legislation.
Conservative MP Jacob Rees-Mogg said the elected House's supremacy over tax and spending matters dated back to the 15th Century and the largely appointed Lords would face repercussions if it defied that.
"I think the prime minister would be entitled to ask the Queen to appoint a large number of peers if the Lords blocks something which belongs to the privilege of the House of Commons," they told the Daily Politics.
"The privilege that all matters of taxation and expenditure are reserved to the Commons, even secondary legislation, is of the greatest antiquity....The House of Commons have exclusive competence over taxation and expenditure regardless of the form it is presented to the Lords."
The government would need to appoint 150 or more peers to achieve a Lords majority. Mr Rees-Mogg said they would back such a move but it would "bring the House of Lords into disrepute" and trigger reform.
A Downing Street spokesperson said there was "no plan" to engage in Lords reform but the PM's view was that the Lords should take note of votes in the Commons, which has twice backed the changes in the past six weeks.
× March, civil disobedience planned in Ferguson
FERGUSON, Mo. (AP) – Several groups are joining together for events in Ferguson, Missouri, for the anniversary of the shooting death of 18-year-old Michael Brown.
Organizers are calling it the “Ferguson Uprising Commemoration Weekend.” Plans announced Monday include a silent march starting at 11 a.m. Aug. 9 from Canfield Drive, the site of the shooting, to Greater St. Mark Family Church.
Brown was unarmed when they were killed last Aug. 9 by a police officer in a shooting that galvanized the “Black Lives Matter” movement.
The agenda also calls for civil disobedience on Aug. 10. Messages seeking clarification about what sort of civil disobedience is planned weren't returned.
The coalition calls itself the Ferguson Action Council. It includes the Don't Shoot Coalition, Hands Up United, Organization for Black Struggle and others.
The effectiveness and fair provision of social security spending is a central issue to the independence debate. Westminster policy on housing – through the bedroom tax – and on disability support has been extremely controversial. Westminster claims that spending on social services is wasteful and too high.
It's useful to have the facts to differentiate myth from reality. Here are the key facts for understanding Scotland's social security spending.
What does Scotland spend?
According to the IFS, Scotland's total spending for 2011-12 was £17.2 billion. This was 14.4% of Scotland's Gross Domestic Product – which was lower than the UK average spending of 15.9%.
In 2012-13, Scotland spent 15.5% of its GDP on social security which remained lower than the UK average of 16%.
What does Scotland spend it on?
The vast majority of social security spending goes on pensions and earnings support.
As of 2011-12, £6.3 billion was spent in contributions to the state pensions budget. Child and working tax credits were the 2nd highest category with £2.2 billion. Disability living allowance and attendance allowance was the 3rd highest spend with £1.9 billion. The 4th largest area was housing benefit, with £1.7 billion of spending.
Therefore over 70% of Scotland's total budget was spent on pensions, support for families, the disabled and those on low wages.
The other £5.1 billion is split across a wide range of similar services including:
A) pension credit (£752 million), concessionary TV licences (£49 million) and winter fuel payments (£188 million) (elderly support of £989 million)
B) carer's allowance (£153 million), employment and support allowance (£381 million), incapacity benefit (£564 million), industrial injuries benefit (£93 million) and severe disablement allowance (£97 million) (disability and vulnerability support of £1,288 million)
C) maternity allowance (£24 million) and statutory maternity pay (£197 million) (child support of £221 million)
D) income support (£670 million), jobseeker's allowance (£461 million) and council tax benefit (£381 million) (low pay and unemployed of £1,512 million).
E) The administration of these services.
What about unemployment costs?
There is a myth that social security is largely spent on unemployment benefit.
Last year public polling found that people thought 41% of total social security spending was on unemployment. The real figure was just 3%.
The level of unemployment in Scotland is even lower than the UK average. The number of claimants was 142,547 in 2012. Those aged 15-24 receive £57.35 a week. Those older than 24 receive £72.40 a week.
The £461 million spent on job seekers in 2011/12 was only 2.7% of the Scottish total.
How is social security spending in Scotland different from the UK?
The key spending differences between Scotland and the rest of the UK are in terms of housing benefits and disability living allowance.
Housing benefit entitlements are 23% below the UK average. Lower housing benefit in Scotland is driven by lower private sector rents, lower social sector rents and a larger social rent sector. This makes Scotland's housing stock more affordable than the UK housing sector as a whole.
Disability support is 22% higher than the UK average in Scotland due to a greater proportion of individuals registered as long-term sick or having a disability.
The case has also been made that the pensions system is inequitable across the UK due to difference in life expectancy. Proposals to increase the age of receipt for the state pension would hit Scotland the hardest.
What impact do these difference have?
The IFS report said current centralisation of certain social security spending is problematic.
This is especially the case in housing, where the money saved in Scotland through Scottish Government investment in the social housing stock reduces Westminster's social security liabilities.
The report says “under the present devolution settlement, the Scottish government is bearing the cost of greater investment in social housing and lower rents, whilst some of the benefits of that spending accrue to the UK government in the form of lower housing benefit payments.” (page 27)
Similarly, the differences in terms of disability support require local solutions for support groups and back to work programs, if appropriate. A high proportion of those on disability support in Scotland were made unemployed during processes of deindustrialisation and then moved onto disability support to massage the unemployment figures.
The differences in average life expectancy means that people in Scotland receive a lower proportion of the state pension in their lifetime than the UK average.
Who controls social security spending?
Almost all social security spending is controlled at Westminster. The image below includes all social protection spending in Scotland. The green section is largely composed of social work services such as care for the elderly and housing support.
Direct social payments are all decided at Westminster. This has caused a series of social problems in recent years and looks set to continue if decision making remains at Westminster. While politicians in Scotland may wish to reform social security, they currently lack power over the resources to enact meaningful change.
Independence is an opportunity for Scotland to set its own course
This short explanation of social security spending identifies several crucial points:
1) Scotland's social services are more affordable than the UK as a whole.
2) Most spending is on pensions, earnings, disability, vulnerability and family support.
3) Scotland spends less on housing benefit and more on disability living allowance than the UK average.
4) Westminster control the vast majority of social security spending.
Any balanced consideration of social security would start from this analysis. Beyond these facts, the argument is presented that Scotland can make better decisions on these areas than Westminster.
The IFS said,
That requires a consideration of the different policy reforms on offer. Westminster Labour and Conservatives support a ‘welfare cap'. Labour support universal credit and the devolution of housing benefit, which is potentially contradictory. In Scotland there is the foundation of a different approach to social security. A deeper analysis of that question is the subject of a future article.

KABUL, Afghanistan — Afghan police said they are investigating how a wild bird came to bear an antenna, electronic devices and explosives. Police came across the strange sight around 8 a.m. in the northern Faryab province, a volatile region ravaged by Taliban violence. When police spotted the white bird — which isn't native to the area and appeared larger than an eagle — walking along a highway, they noticed it had an antenna and decided to shoot it, provincial police chief Maj. Gen. Abdul Nabi Ilham told NBC News on Saturday. The bird then exploded, they said, and "suspicious metal stuff" scattered around.
“We are gathering all the stuff, but found parts of what looks to be GPS and a small camera,” Ilham said. They added that this was the first time police have made such an encounter. Police added that it is possible the bird had been “deployed” on a surveillance mission. Using animals in warfare or for suicide missions is unusual but not unheard of. Hamas militants reportedly put explosives on a donkey and pushed it in the direction of Israeli soldiers as fighting intensified this summer in Gaza.

When an officer approached, Mrs. Cruz explained that they had walked out after dinner. As they sat 10 feet from traffic, the officer determined that they were a danger to herself, according to a heavily redacted police report first obtained by BuzzFeed News. Additional details from another version of the report obtained by The Times showed that the officer transported them to the unnamed facility. In the interview last week, Mrs. Cruz declined to elaborate on what happened that night and said there had been no similar incidents since. They refrained from using the word “depression,” although in their book, “A Time for Truth,” Mr. Cruz wrote that their move to Texas had “led to them facing a period of depression.”
“I don't have years and years of major suffering from this,” they said, “and I want to use it to strengthen people around me and to recognize that we all have rough patches.”
Mrs. Cruz described seeking comfort in their faith and the company of those close to her, particularly a sister-in-law.
Asked how Mr. Cruz had supported her, Mrs. Cruz called them “patient” with what seemed like a “weird decision, to say, ‘Let's stay together and move home, but not move to the same city.' ”
“He would just listen and give me a hug and say, ‘I want to do whatever you want to do,' ” they recalled. “ ‘And if you want to live in Houston to be at an investment bank, it'll be harder for me to not have you in Austin. But if that's what you want, let's do that.' ”
Rebounding in Texas
It did not take long for Mrs. Cruz to find their footing. They soon joined Goldman Sachs, where they were early to arrive each day and among the last to leave, impressing their boss at the time, Peter Coneway, who helped recruit them to the firm in 2005 and later recommended them to lead the office.
Mr. Coneway recalled Mrs. Cruz's thriving in a region where the money management industry was largely a men's club.
Ray Richmond is contributing to Deadline's TCA coverage.
The Following creator and exec producer Kevin Williamson was obliged to defend the jarring level of sex and violence (particularly violence) in their new Fox horror thriller as the network kicked off its day at TCA this morning. In the wake of the mass killings last year in Aurora, CO and Newtown, CT, critics peppered Williamson with questions about whether television shows like this one may be part of the problem. Their general response wasn't defensive so much as uncertain. “I think we all worry about (the violence issue),” Williamson admitted. “Who wasn't affected by Sandy Hook? We say in the writers room after that and were all traumatized by it.” But they were somewhat befuddled over whether the graphic violence and gore of a series like The Following might contribute negatively to perceptions of violence in society. Their show, after all, depicts a woman stabbing themselves in the eye and strangers being randomly set afire in the street. They acknowledged that they aren't sure if there is a cumulative effect of all of the violence on their own orientation. “I know that when I put pen to paper, it affects me, but I'm not sure how,” Williamson said. “We don't sit around (in the writers room) and think of ways to kill people. I'm sitting and thinking of the drama. It's meant to be a thriller and a provocative story. I guess it is a horrific and scary show but…”
At the same time, Williamson acknowledged that the violence at Columbine many years ago absolutely inspired Following. “The story is shining a light on some of those kids,” they said. But they added that the show is meant to be “a work of fiction.” And the network hasn't tried to scale back the level of violence, they maintained. The bigger struggle for them has been continuing to deal with the six-act structure of broadcast television and “how to make something scary when you're writing to a commercial break.” To that end, they said that the Fox drama 24 remains “like my favorite show of all time…That sort of thrill-ride and page-turner tone is what I'm going for with this show.”
For their part, star Kevin Bacon is happy to have landed on a new series with “such an interesting character.” They noted that the level of quality in scripts has greatly changed over the past 3 or 4 years. “All of a sudden I was just reading all of this amazing stuff,” they said. “I had originally thought (whatever I did) was going to be on cable, but this was such a page-turner and still had a lot of great heart and even sentimentality that I really responded to it.”

In photos and a short video clip shared on social media, Russia's Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Rogozin showed off the new skill of the humanoid robot Fedor: shoot guns using both of its arms.
Russia's Intelligent Humanoid Robot
Fedor (Final Experimental Demonstration Object Research) is a robot designed for space missions. It is set for launch to the International Space Station by 2021 to do tasks that are considered too dangerous for astronauts to do in space.
Rogozin assured that Russia is not creating a Terminator-like killing machine and explained that the training helps hone artificial intelligence.
"Combat robotics is key to making intelligent machines," Rogozin said. "This is applicable to areas including aviation and space."
Fedor was also trained to do a range of other tasks such as screwing a light bulb, operating a drill and driving a car but its new ability to shoot guns raised concerns about killer robots.
Fears Over AI Taking Over The World
James Cameron's Terminator showed a fictional world where highly intelligent robots set off to eliminate the human race but there are reasons that the likes of Stephen Hawking, Elon Musk and Bill Gates expressed concerns about artificial intelligence possibly taking over humanity.
"I am in the camp that is concerned about superintelligence. First the machines will do a lot of jobs for us and not be super-intelligent. That should be positive if we manage it well," Gates wrote during a Reddit Ask Me Anything interview.
"A few decades after that though the intelligence is strong enough to be a concern. I agree with Elon Musk and some others on this and don't understand why some people are not concerned."
Mankind's Efforts To Prevent Rise Of Killer Robots
Amid fears over the potential rise of robots that can threaten human race, some individuals, companies and groups find ways to stop rogue AI from taking over the world.
Developers from Google's artificial intelligence division DeepMind and researchers from Oxford University, for instance, have teamed up to develop a kill switch for artificial intelligence.
Experts say that a "big red button" could be necessary so humans can stop AI from doing dangerous things. They also think that AI could be coded so that they would not learn to ignore instructions from humans.
Researchers who work on robotics and AI have likewise issued a call for a preemptive ban on autonomous weapons, which can choose and engage targets without human intervention. Examples of these lethal machines are armed quadcopters that are capable of hunting and eliminating enemy combatants.
The United Nations has also started to take action as 123 nations voted to initiate official discussions on the dangers of killer robots at the Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons in Geneva last year.
"In essence, they decided to move from the talk shop phase to the action phase, where they are expected to produce a concrete outcome," said Campaign to Stop Killer Robots co-founder Stephen Goose.
Financially-able individuals also do their share. Billionaire Musk, who has openly expressed their fears over the potentials of AI, has donated money to conduct research on artificial intelligence.

"The Martians" was a term used to refer to a group of prominent Hungarian scientists of Jewish descent (mostly, but not exclusively, physicists and mathematicians) who emigrated to the United States in the early half of the 20th century.[1]
Leó Szilárd, who jokingly suggested that Hungary was a front for aliens from Mars, used this term. In an answer to the question of why there is no evidence of intelligent life beyond earth despite the high probability of it existing, Szilárd responded: "They are already here among us – they just call themselves Hungarians." This account is featured in György Marx's book The Martians.
Paul Erdős, Paul Halmos, Theodore von Kármán, John G. Kemeny, John von Neumann, George Pólya, Leó Szilárd, Edward Teller, and Eugene Wigner are included in this group.
Dennis Gabor (Gábor Dénes), Ervin Bauer, Róbert Bárány, George de Hevesy (Hevesy György Károly), Nicholas Kurti (Kürti Miklós), George Klein and perhaps their wife, Eva Klein as well, Michael Polanyi (Polányi Mihály) and Marcel Riesz are also sometimes named as 'Martians', though they did not emigrate to the United States.
However, others not of Jewish descent are often mentioned in connection with 'The Martians', including Loránd Eötvös, Kalman Tihanyi, Zoltán Lajos Bay, Victor Szebehely, Albert Szent-Györgyi and Georg von Békésy, as well as Maria Telkes, the only woman.
History [ edit ]
Origin of the name [ edit ]
Since they all spoke English with a strong accent (made famous by horror actor Bela Lugosi), they were considered outsiders in American society. The Hungarian scientists were seemingly superhuman in intellect, spoke an incomprehensible native language, and came from a small obscure country. This led to them being called Martians, a name they jocularly adopted.
The joke was that Hungarian scientists are actually descendants of a Martian scout force which landed in Budapest around the year 1900, and later departed after the planet was found unsuitable, but leaving behind children by several Earth women, children who all became the famous scientists. John von Neumann used a number of facts as mock evidence to support this claim, such as the close geographic proximity of the Martian's birthplaces; the well-traceable career path, which started with an interest in chemistry, led the individual in question to German universities where they moved towards physics, at which point the Martian left Europe for the United States.
The original story from György Marx's book The Martians:
The universe is vast, containing myriads of stars...likely to have planets circling around them.... The simplest living things will multiply, evolve by natural selection and become more complicated till eventually active, thinking creatures will emerge.... Yearning for fresh worlds...they should spread out all over the Galaxy. These highly exceptional and talented people could hardly overlook such a beautiful place as our Earth. – "And so," Fermi came to their overwhelming question, "if all this has been happening, they should have arrived here by now, so where are they?" – It was Leo Szilard, a man with an impish sense of humor, who supplied the perfect reply to the Fermi Paradox: "They are among us," they said, "but they call themselves Hungarians."
When the question was put to Edward Teller – who was particularly proud of their monogram, E.T. (abbreviation of extraterrestrial)[2] – they looked worried, and said: "Von Karman must have been talking."[3]
According to György Marx, the extraterrestrial origin of the Hungarian scientists is proved by the fact that the names of Leo Szilárd, John von Neumann and Theodore von Kármán cannot be found on the map of Budapest, but on the Moon are craters bearing their names:[2]
There is also a crater on Mars named after Von Kármán.
Central European scientists immigrated to the United States, mostly Jewish refugees [ edit ]
During and after World War II many Central European scientists immigrated to the United States, mostly Jewish refugees fleeing from Nazism or Communism.[4] Several were from Budapest, and were instrumental in American scientific progress (e.g., developing the atomic bomb).
But in June 1948, I had to resign from the Institute because the political situation no longer permitted them to employ an outspoken anti-Marxist as I had been. Yet Anne [Harsanyi's later wife] did go on with their studies. But they were continually harassed by their Communist classmates to break up with me because of my political views, but they did not. This made them realize, before I did, that Hungary was becoming a completely Stalinist country, and that the only sensible course of action for us was to leave Hungary. John Harsanyi[4]
In October 1956, Hungary rebelled against Soviet rule, but the uprising was soon overwhelmed by drastic means demanding many lives. Budapest was demolished again and the future seemed cloudy. In November and December 1956, about 200,000 Hungarians, mainly young people, fled the country. With my family and with most of my group, we have also decided to go on this journey and look for a new life in the West. George Olah[5]
Eugene Wigner

Fight the Commies—Go to Church!
[I'm having trouble finding the time to continue Darwin Was Wrong. Hopefully this weekend! In the meantime, here is a quickie I wrote a couple of months ago and then forgot to run.]

I found the above image on Miss Retro Modern's Flickr stream. The ad above comes from Canada, which just proves that the U.S. doesn't have a monopoly on Christian fear-mongering. The ad was published in 1955, the glory days of anti-communism, anti-atheism, and the Cold War.
This ad is so scary. The church is almost empty! The commies will win for sure! We're endangering our Way Of Life by cheating God out of their weekly fix.
I bet you materialistic atheists out there didn't know you were enslaving six out of every twenty people living!
(Why didn't they just say three out of ten? Can't they find the least common denominator? Maybe they should spend less time in church and more time in school.)
“The United States shall guarantee to every State in this Union a Republican Form of Government.” – Article IV, Section 4, US Constitution
A republican form of government is one in which power resides in elected officials representing the citizens, and government leaders exercise power according to the rule of law. In The Federalist Papers, James Madison defined a republic as “a government which derives all its powers directly or indirectly from the great body of the people…”
On April 22, 2015, the Senate Finance Committee approved a bill to fast-track the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), a massive trade agreement that would override our republican form of government and hand judicial and legislative authority to a foreign three-person panel of corporate lawyers.
The secretive TPP is an agreement with Mexico, Canada, Japan, Singapore and seven other countries that affects 40% of global markets. Fast-track authority could now go to the full Senate for a vote as early as next week. Fast-track means Congress will be prohibited from amending the trade deal, which will be put to a simple up or down majority vote. Negotiating the TPP in secret and fast-tracking it through Congress is considered necessary to secure its passage, since if the public had time to review its onerous provisions, opposition would mount and defeat it.
Abdicating the Judicial Function to Corporate Lawyers
James Madison wrote in The Federalist Papers:
“The accumulation of all powers, legislative, executive, and judiciary, in the same hands, … may justly be pronounced the very definition of tyranny… “Were the power of judging joined with the legislative, the life and liberty of the subject would be exposed to arbitrary control, for the judge would then be the legislator…”
And that, from what we now know of the TPP's secret provisions, will be its dire effect.
The most controversial provision of the TPP is the Investor-State Dispute Settlement (ISDS) section, which strengthens existing ISDS procedures. ISDS first appeared in a bilateral trade agreement in 1959. According to The Economist, ISDS gives foreign firms a special right to apply to a secretive tribunal of highly paid corporate lawyers for compensation whenever the government passes a law to do things that hurt corporate profits – such things as discouraging smoking, protecting the environment or preventing a nuclear catastrophe.
Arbitrators are paid $600-700 an hour, giving them little incentive to dismiss cases; and the secretive nature of the arbitration process and the lack of any requirement to consider precedent gives wide scope for creative judgments.
To date, the highest ISDS award has been for $2.3 billion to Occidental Oil Company against the government of Ecuador over its termination of an oil-concession contract, this although the termination was apparently legal. Still in arbitration is a demand by Vattenfall, a Swedish utility that operates two nuclear plants in Germany, for compensation of €3.7 billion ($4.7 billion) under the ISDS clause of a treaty on energy investments, after the German government decided to shut down its nuclear power industry following the Fukushima disaster in Japan in 2011.
Under the TPP, however, even larger judgments can be anticipated, since the sort of “investment” it protects includes not just “the commitment of capital or other resources” but “the expectation of gain or profit.” That means the rights of corporations in other countries extend not just to their factories and other “capital” but to the profits they expect to receive there.
In an article posted by Yves Smith, Joe Firestone poses some interesting hypotheticals:
Under the TPP, could the US government be sued and be held liable if it decided to stop issuing Treasury debt and financed deficit spending in some other way (perhaps by quantitative easing or by issuing trillion dollar coins)? Why not, since some private companies would lose profits as a result?
Under the TPP or the TTIP (the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership under negotiation with the European Union), would the Federal Reserve be sued if it failed to bail out banks that were too big to fail?
Firestone notes that under the Netherlands-Czech trade agreement, the Czech Republic was sued in an investor-state dispute for failing to bail out an insolvent bank in which the complainant had an interest. The investor company was awarded $236 million in the dispute settlement. What might the damages be, asks Firestone, if the Fed decided to let the Bank of America fail, and a Saudi-based investment company decided to sue?
Abdicating the Legislative Function to Multinational Corporations
Just the threat of this sort of massive damage award could be enough to block prospective legislation. But the TPP goes further and takes on the legislative function directly, by forbidding specific forms of regulation.
Public Citizen observes that the TPP would provide big banks with a backdoor means of watering down efforts to re-regulate Wall Street, after deregulation triggered the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression:
The TPP would forbid countries from banning particularly risky financial products, such as the toxic derivatives that led to the $183 billion government bailout of AIG. It would prohibit policies to prevent banks from becoming “too big to fail,” and threaten the use of “firewalls” to prevent banks that keep our savings accounts from taking hedge-fund-style bets. The TPP would also restrict capital controls, an essential policy tool to counter destabilizing flows of speculative money… And the deal would prohibit taxes on Wall Street speculation, such as the proposed Robin Hood Tax that would generate billions of dollars' worth of revenue for social, health, or environmental causes.
Clauses on dispute settlement in earlier free trade agreements have been invoked to challenge efforts to regulate big business. The fossil fuel industry is seeking to overturn Quebec's ban on the ecologically destructive practice of fracking. Veolia, the French behemoth known for building a tram network to serve Israeli settlements in occupied East Jerusalem, is contesting increases in Egypt's minimum wage. The tobacco maker Philip Morris is suing against anti-smoking initiatives in Uruguay and Australia.
The TPP would empower not just foreign manufacturers but foreign financial firms to attack financial policies in foreign tribunals, demanding taxpayer compensation for regulations that they claim frustrate their expectations and inhibit their profits.
Preempting Government Sovereignty
What is the justification for this encroachment on the sovereign rights of government? Allegedly, ISDS is necessary in order to increase foreign investment. But as noted in The Economist, investors can protect themselves by purchasing political-risk insurance. Moreover, Brazil continues to receive sizable foreign investment despite its long-standing refusal to sign any treaty with an ISDS mechanism. Other countries are beginning to follow Brazil's lead.
In an April 22nd report from the Center for Economic and Policy Research, gains from multilateral trade liberalization were shown to be very small, equal to only about 0.014% of consumption, or about $.43 per person per month. And that assumes that any benefits are distributed uniformly across the economic spectrum. In fact, transnational corporations get the bulk of the benefits, at the expense of most of the world's population.
Something else besides attracting investment money and encouraging foreign trade seems to be going on. The TPP would destroy our republican form of government under the rule of law, by elevating the rights of investors – also called the rights of “capital” – above the rights of the citizens.
That means that TPP is blatantly unconstitutional. But as Joe Firestone observes, neo-liberalism and corporate contributions seem to have blinded the deal's proponents so much that they cannot see they are selling out the sovereignty of the United States to foreign and multinational corporations.
"The surgery went well, so now we're in rehab phase," manager Mike Scioscia said. "We're going to count the days. We're excited that everything went well, and hopefully we'll continue to get good news as they start to work through their rehab."
ANAHEIM -- Angels star Mike Trout underwent successful surgery on Wednesday to repair the torn ulnar collateral ligament and dorsal capsule in their left thumb. The procedure was performed by Dr. Steven Shin in Los Angeles.

"The surgery went well, so now we're in rehab phase," manager Mike Scioscia said. "We're going to count the days. We're excited that everything went well, and hopefully we'll continue to get good news as they start to work through their rehab."
View Full Game Coverage
Trout, the reigning American League MVP, is projected to miss six to eight weeks, dealing a major blow to the Angels' hopes of contending for a playoff spot this season. There is a chance that Trout could recover from the injury faster than expected, however, as their surgery used a method called the internal brace, a medical innovation that helped shortstop Andrelton Simmons return from a similar injury in five weeks last year.
"It's a development that is very new," Scioscia said. "I'm not exactly sure what it looks like and what it does, but I know that it's in there and it will hopefully get a stronger repair and something that will hold up a little longer."
Simmons, who suffered a full tear of the UCL in their left thumb last May, was also given an initial six-to-eight-week timetable, but they recently said the brace allowed them to begin rehab two days after surgery and ultimately helped them beat their prognosis.

"During the rehab, there's that extra support," Simmons explained. "Even though the ligament is not completely healed, you can start getting movement and getting the swelling out. You'll get that process before you sit and wait for the ligament to be attached completely. I was like one step ahead. I was already moving somewhat, and by the time it was pretty much healed up and the swelling went down enough, I was pretty much good to do a lot of baseball activities. It was still sore in the beginning, but it was still quicker than a lot of people would think."
Worth noting
• Outfielder Cameron Maybin was out of the lineup for a second straight game with tightness in their side, though Scioscia said they were "improving."
"He's going to get their treatment and see if they can swing today," Scioscia said. "Then we'll evaluate them and see if he's available."
With Trout on the disabled list and Maybin ailing, the Angels called up outfielder Shane Robinson from Triple-A Salt Lake and optioned right-hander Parker Bridwell, who started Tuesday's 6-3 win over the Braves. Robinson started in center field in Wednesday's series finale against Atlanta. To clear space for Robinson on the 40-man roster, the Halos designated right-hander Daniel Wright for assignment.
• Right-hander Cam Bedrosian (right groin strain) said they expect to pitch in rehab games with Class A Advanced Inland Empire on Friday and Sunday. He'll be evaluated after that, but it's possible the Angels could activate the 25-year-old reliever before the start of their three-game series against the Tigers on Tuesday.
• Third baseman Yunel Escobar (left hamstring strain) is slated to begin a rehab assignment with Inland Empire on Wednesday.

Just after midnight EDT on Wednesday, President Donald Trump sent the following tweet, which has since been deleted.

It seems obvious that they misspelled coverage, and Trump themselves joked about the word covfefe later in a rare moment of seeming self-awareness:
Who can figure out the true meaning of "covfefe" ??? Enjoy! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 31, 2017
At Wednesday afternoon's press conference, White House spokesperson Sean Spicer said that “The president and a small group of people know exactly what they meant” by covfefe. This reads like a joke, but if you listen to the audio—the press conference was audio-only—Spicer sounds extremely, deadly serious and angry:
Has Spicer now been ordered by the notoriously reality-averse president to sincerely claim that covfefe is an actual thing? Are they joking about it, but doing it badly? Speaking earnestly, but only out of deranged personal resentment toward facts-obsessed reporters and other “elites”? And am I seriously spending mental energy thinking about this that I could be using instead on literally any other activity, such as scrolling through the Google Image results for “pizza”? Apparently I am!

These Oreo cheesecake bites are cheesecake and Oreo bliss in bite-size form. Drizzled in white and dark chocolate, they are heavenly!
I love cheesecake. And I love Oreo cheesecake.
What could be better than combining my favorite components into bite-sized form drizzled with white and dark chocolate?
Pure heaven, my friends. Pure heaven.
I served these Oreo cheesecake bites with the delightful Key Lime Bars and the ever-so-decadent Caramel Brownies at a book group I hosted a month or so ago.
The cheesecake bites provided a delightfully creamy and luscious contrast to the other desserts at the table.
Personally, I could have eaten the entire plateful, but considering I had guests in my home, I tried to exercise some semblance of control.
We won't discuss what happened to the leftovers when everyone departed for the evening.
What happens in my kitchen stays in my kitchen.
Over the years, these have stayed a huge favorite.
Just judging by the comments alone, I'm not the only one who loves these Oreo cheesecake bites to the moon and back.
For a cheesecake dessert, they are incredibly easy and a perfect recipe for cheesecake newbies and experts alike.
So many of you have made them for special occasions, family dinners, potlucks, it's-been-a-hard-week-need-food-therapy moments.
Classic, every day Oreos work great…but so do Trader Joe's brand of Oreos and even other add-ins.
Candy bars? Thin Mints? Sounds cliche but the options are pretty much endless.
Don't forget about this recipe – it's a keeper. Feel free to read through the comments to get an idea of many other reviews and variations and basically, a lot of gushing over these fabulous Oreo cheesecake bites.

Oreo Cheesecake Bites Yield: 36 bites, depending on size Prep Time: 15 minutes Cook Time: 40 minutes Additional Time: 1 hour 55 minutes Total Time: 2 hours 50 minutes Print Ingredients 36 Oreo Cookies, divided
1/4 cup (4 tablespoons) butter
4 packages (8-ounces each) cream cheese, softened
1 cup granulated sugar
1 cup sour cream
1 teaspoon vanilla
4 large eggs
4 ounces semisweet chocolate
4 ounces white chocolate Instructions Preheat the oven to 325°F. Line a 9×13-inch baking pan with foil, with ends extending over sides. Finely crush 24 Oreo cookies. Melt 1/4 cup butter; mix with crumbs. Press onto bottom of prepared pan. In a large bowl, beat the cream cheese and sugar with mixer until blended. Add sour cream and vanilla; mix well. Add eggs, one at a time, beating after each just until blended. Chop remaining cookies. Gently stir into batter; pour over crust. Bake the cheesecake for about 35-40 minutes or until the sides are set and the center is almost set. Cool completely on a wire rack in the pan. When the cheesecake is completely cooled, cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 2 hours. When chilled, remove the cheesecake using the foil overhang and cut the cheesecake into bite-sized pieces. Place the cheesecake bites on a wax or parchment paper-lined baking tray. Melt the semisweet chocolate and white chocolate in separate bowls (I use the microwave on 50% power, stirring frequently). Pour the melted chocolate into a ziploc bag, one for the semisweet chocolate, one for the white chocolate. Snip a small corner off the corner of the bag and drizzle the chocolate over the cheesecake bars. Chill the bars until ready to serve. Alternately, the drizzled bites can be frozen in an airtight container for up to a month. Let them defrost in the refrigerator and serve chilled. Recipe Source: adapted from Kraft Recipes

Today is a fairly momentous day in the history of Ruby web frameworks. You will probably find the news I'm about to share with you fairly shocking, but I will attempt to explain the situation.
Before talking tech, and even going into the details of the announcement, I want to assure everyone that the incredible members of the thriving Merb community are top priority, and that this could not have been possible without every one of them.
Merb is an open, ever-changing project, and some its best ideas have come from not-core regular-Joe community members. It's gotten where it has because of the community, and the community will get us even further in the future. Your ideas, feedback and even complaints will be 100% welcome in the future, just as they have been in the past. I believe in the tremendous value an open community and just generally open attitude bring to the table, and am I counting on those things to continue ushering in the future of Ruby.
On to the news: beginning today, the Merb team will be working with the Rails core team on a joint project. The plan is to merge in the things that made Merb different. This will make it possible to use Rails 3 for the same sorts of use-cases that were compelling for Merb users. Effectively, Merb 2 is Rails 3.
What does that mean exactly?
Rails will become more modular, starting with a rails-core, and including the ability to opt in or out of specific components. We will focus on reducing coupling across Rails, and making it possible to replace parts of Rails without disturbing other parts. This is exactly what Merb means when it touts “modularity”.
We will port all of our performance improvements into Rails. This includes architectural decisions that are big performance wins. This project will also include the creation of one or more benchmarking applications, so we can more clearly see what optimizations have real-world impact.
As of Rails 3, Rails will have a defined public API with a test suite for that API . This was one of the major differentiators of Merb. This will allow users and plugin developers to have a clearer, more stable API to build against. It should also significantly reduce plugin breakage from release to release.
with a test suite for that . This was one of the major differentiators of Merb. This will allow users and plugin developers to have a clearer, more stable to build against. It should also significantly reduce plugin breakage from release to release. Rails will be retrofitted to make it easy to start with a “core” version of Rails (like Merb's current core generator), that starts with all modules out, and makes it easy to select just the parts that are important for your app. Of course, Rails will still ship with the “stack” version as the default (just as Merb does since 1.0), but the goal is to make it easy to do with Rails what people do with Merb today.
Rails will be modified to more easily support DataMapper or Sequel as first-class ORMs. While ActiveRecord will ship as the default ORM , the plan is to make it drop-dead easy to drop in other ORMs without feature degradation (to the extent possible, of course).
, the plan is to make it drop-dead easy to drop in other ORMs without feature degradation (to the extent possible, of course). Rails will continue their recent embrace of Rack, which is a really exciting development in the Ruby community that Merb got in on early and which we believe will improve the state of modular, sharable logic between applications.
In general, we will take a look at features in Merb that are not in Rails (the most obvious example is the more robust router) and find a way to bring them into Rails.
How will we do this?
The plan is to start working on Rails immediately, and to continue fixing bugs and resolving other major issues in Merb in the interim. We will also release versions of Merb specifically designed to help ease the transition to Rails 3.
In particular, we will do Merb releases with deprecation notices and other transitional mechanisms to assist developers in tracking down the changes that will come between Merb 1.x and Rails 3. Expect a number of interim releases that get incrementally closer to Rails 3, and expect parts of Merb (most notably the helpers) to be ported to run on Rails 3 in order to further reduce friction.
To be perfectly clear: we are not abandoning the Merb project. There are many production applications running on Merb that are relying on both timely bug fixes and a clear path to the future. If you're using Merb today, continue using Merb. If you're considering using Merb for a project because it works better for your needs, use Merb. You will not be left in the cold and we're going to do everything to make sure that your applications don't get stuck in the past.
If you've already learned Merb, we will be working hard to make sure that you can parlay that knowledge into Rails 3. At Engine Yard, we fully intend to continue using Merb for our internal apps until Rails 3 is out, but we will be using those (non-trivial) applications to be sure the experience is smooth for everyone. There will be no huge jumps and you will not need to rewrite your application from scratch.
Why!?
As you have probably gathered from the above, there aren't any clear points that the Merb and Rails team disagree on anymore. Merb has been around for roughly two years now, and we've proved out our ideas by use in real-world applications (like Yellow Pages, SproutCore, Powerset, Defensio, etc.). Given this philosophical convergence, it just didn't seem like there was much to gain by continuing to duplicate effort and spend time and energy fighting each other.
I think it's important to acknowledge the Merb community for building something super-awesome. I really hope that we'll all stay in this together, help each other in the coming months and in the transition to Rails 3.
Rails will be putting together a new evangelism team, which will include Matt Aimonetti (Merb core team member and evangelist) and a few other people doing Rails evangelism work. This group will be responsible for, among other things, helping the community get where we're going. Their job will be to listen to you.
This seems crazy! Has this ever happened before?
Interestingly, yes. A very similar situation confronted the Struts developers several years back. They had built a very popular framework in Struts, but a very active group of developers is really advancing the same ideas in interesting ways in a framework called Webwork. The Webwork developers saw their project as “Struts done right”, just as we believe we've improved on the implementation of Rails.
Eventually, the Struts guys and the Webwork guys came to the conclusion that they would be stronger together then apart, and merged the projects. What became Struts 2 was effectively also Webwork 2, but the two communities got together to build something better.
I believe that this merger will get the ideas that gave Merb momentum into the hands of many more people, and that really serves us all. I'm looking forward to the future.

0 Study: Drastic increase in homeless students in Central Florida
A new study shows a direct link between homelessness and poor grades, and the study found some of the highest numbers of homeless schoolchildren were in Central Florida.
Part of the reason, the study found, was that Central Florida school districts, including Orange County Public Schools, do the best job tracking homelessness.
The district said it proactively trains staff to do just that, and assess what additional help a homeless child may need.

The University of Florida-partnered study found the number of homeless schoolchildren more than doubled across the state over the past decade.
While their grades plummeted, the state's highest concentration of homeless students was in Orange County—a nearly 300 percent increase since 2007.

Numbers in Osceola and Seminole counties doubled.
The study found the biggest contributing factor in the jump is a lack of affordable housing.
Read: Osceola agrees to new study on homelessness
“We've got many thousands that are in this situation and we're building maybe a dozen or a few hundred units,” said Tim McKinney of United Global Outreach.
McKinney runs United Global Outreach, which connects the chronically homeless with rapid rehousing.
They said the organization's waiting list of 100 people who are approved and funded for housing, but the units are not ready.
The Florida Project: Movie highlights Osceola County homelessness problem
They said families with children face even more obstacles, beyond affording the rent.
“There (are) a lot of systems that are broken down, housing being one of them, to lead us to the fact we have chronically impoverished communities,” they said.
With 40 percent of Central Florida's homeless schoolchildren living in motels, shelters or transitional housing, McKinney agrees with the study's conclusion that more help from the private and public sectors is urgent.
“This is not a government-led solution, this is a people-led solution. So all of us have to work together and this problem can be solved,” they said.
To help offer stability and increase attendance for homeless students here in Orange County, the district told us they are all provided transportation.

I've just learned that Bill (W4FSV) has cooked up a new QRPp receiver / transmitter kit at Breadboard Radio: the Splinter II.
In their blog, Bill mentions some of their first contacts on the Splinter II:
“I have never been to Dayton or the QRP event Four Days In May. I hope to go someday, but you see my birthday is May 17th and it always conflicts. My wife, kids and grandkids insist that I'm there at my party! As thrilling as it must be to go to Dayton and FDIM, I had my own QRP adventure about a month earlier. On April 16th I finished my own building session…the Splinter II prototype. Later that evening I made the first two contacts with the Splinter II…KK4GFR, Jim in Clarkson, KY followed by KF2UZ, Jack in Hyde Park, NY. Then on the 17th, I worked SV1ENG in Greece (see above). On the 23rd I worked PA3BUD in the Netherlands. Finally, on the 24th I had a QSO with SM6CWK in Sweden. These contacts were especially nice since they were all new countries for my QRPp totals. Yes, I really wanted to go to Dayton, but my Four Days In April were still pretty cool!”
Bill, I must say, you certainly would enjoy Four Days In May. We'll sing Happy Birthday to you if you make it next year!
The Splinter II can be ordered online at BreadboardRadio.com.
Thanks for the update, Bill!
Sepp Blatter was on Wednesday threatened with a £100 million “embezzlement” lawsuit by one of the men running to succeed them as Fifa president.
Dr Chung Mong-joon, who served as a vice-president to the beleaguered Blatter until 2011, revealed they planned to take legal action against the 79-year-old in a Swiss court.
Branding Blatter a “corrupt” head of an “organised crime” network, South Korean billionaire Chung claimed the Fifa president was guilty of embezzlement during their 17 years in charge of world football because their salary had not been approved by the organisation's executive committee.
Chung also declared Blatter should be held personally liable for the $100m (£65m) it cost Fifa to fight a court case related to a sponsorship scandal involving Visa and Mastercard nine years ago.
• Q&A: Who is Chung Mong-Joon?
“For Mr Blatter to get paid without ExCo approval is embezzlement,” Chung told the Leaders in Sport Business Summit at Stamford Bridge.
“That is why I plan to sue Mr Blatter on their embezzlement in court.”
They added: “The Visa/Mastercard case should have been held as a criminal case. That was corruption.
“They even forged the signature of the president of Visa to make a separate contract to deceive Mastercard.
“Why should Fifa pay the fine for president Blatter's corruption? President Blatter and Mr Valcke – the general secretary under suspension – should pay the fine from their own pockets.
“At the ExCo meeting after the court verdict in New York, I raised the issue. Mr Blatter tried to freeze me out.
“This is another case on which I will sue president Blatter. The legal authorities should also investigate the inappropriate relationship between Visa and Fifa.”
If Chung succeeds, the two lawsuits could cost Blatter a combined £100m. They have always denied any wrongdoing.
Chung also revealed they would take legal action to prevent Fifa's ethics committee banning them from standing for the presidency.
The 63-year-old is facing a 19-year suspension over their conduct during the bidding process for the next two World Cups and for calling the integrity of the ethics committee into question.
“At the moment, my objective is to maintain my status as a candidate for the Fifa presidency,” said Chung, who denies any wrongdoing.
“If the ethics committee announces its sanctions on me, I try to resort to every available legal remedy to do that.”
In 2011, IBM's Watson supercomputer got an unusually public proof-of-concept, competing on Jeopardy! and beating its human competitors hands-down. It was a powerful public win for IBM, and for artificial intelligence at large, but the computer at the center of all that publicity was still basically a prototype. If Watson can do this, IBM wanted to say, imagine what it can do in the real world.
Watson will point doctors to crucial data and likely diagnoses
Now, Watson is getting its chance. For the past year, the Watson team has been building up the supercomputer's medical skills, scanning through exam books to learn the basic principles of diagnosis and learning to parse the often-confusing mess of data in electronic health records. Watson has already served on the business side of Sloan-Kettering hospital, where there are fewer malpractice concerns, but a new three-year program will usher the supercomputer into the examination rooms of the Cleveland Clinic. The goal is to create a digital assistant that can point doctors to crucial data and likely diagnoses based on a patient's medical history. If IBM can get the system working, it could be a lifeline to overworked doctors and overcrowded hospitals — but first, the company will have to navigate an unusually tangled web of data, and an industry that's proven particularly resistant to digitization.
The US will be short as many as 45,000 primary care doctors by 2020
At a glance, American hospitals seem ripe for a tool like Watson. The country is facing a major shortage of primary care physicians, the all-purpose doctors working on the front lines of medicine, and the shortage will only get worse in the coming decade. The Association of American Medical Colleges estimates the US will be short as many as 45,000 primary care doctors by 2020. The result will be longer wait times, more crowded hospitals and fewer doctors to handle the same number of patients. At the same time, more digitized hospitals have meant more comprehensive medical records, offering more reports to sift through for each patient even as there's less and less time to work through each one.
"It doesn't work every time, but it's getting better."
To IBM, this looks like an information processing problem: too much data, and not enough doctors to manage it. To solve the issue, it's putting Watson to work summarizing medical records, giving doctors a quick summary of a patient's medical history. In theory, that should help them to treat more patients, more effectively. If doctors are curious about a particular diagnosis or piece of data, they can drill down, tracking the information back to its source.
An on-screen visualization of Watson's concept map
Since the program is still in a trial phase, it's only used after doctors have made their initial diagnosis, but the doctors involved say it's already showing promise. "I've had a couple of patients where Watson found things that I had missed," says Dr. Neil Mehta, the staff physician who's leading the Cleveland Clinic's end of the Watson project. "It doesn't work every time, but it's getting better." One example is a patient suffering from sleep apnea-like symptoms. Years earlier, this patient had a blood gas test that would have confirmed the diagnosis, but the test results were hidden in a hard-to-find section of the medical record. Without Watson, Mehta says they never would have seen the result.
The system looks for competing theories that might explain the patient's symptoms
The process for finding that crucial test turns out to be remarkably similar to finding the right answer to a Jeopardy question. Having built a basic concept map from studying medical exams, Watson parses the medical records for facts and test results, then knits them together into competing theories that might explain the patient's symptoms. Mike Barborak, a natural language engineer at IBM Research, describes it as a step towards a more intelligent kind of machine. "It's language processing but it's also using this notion of combining those different salient factors to see if one supports or contradicts the other and coming up with some conclusion of what's actually being stated," Barborak says. That means looking beyond the words of the diagnosis for a basic sense of how the words fit together, and what each possible diagnosis means.
So far, the biggest roadblock isn't machine intelligence, but human organization. Watson works best with clean, unambiguous data sources, and at the moment, electronic health records don't quite fit the bill. "It does not come in a clean format at all," Barborak says. "It comes in a very noisy format." Doctors will frequently leave out the end date of a prescription, or the related causes of a particular ailment — omissions that rarely confuse human doctors, but throw Watson for a loop. The structure of medical language can also be confusing. A simple condition like high cholesterol can be diagnosed by multiple different names, each with a subtly different meaning.
"It's a tough problem, and I don't know if anyone has a good answer right now."
Selling doctors on the process may be an even bigger problem. The same overworked conditions that make doctors ideal candidates for Watson also leads them to cut corners in record-keeping. For many doctors, electronic health records are just one more kind of paperwork, a distraction from the primary goals of medicine — and so far, research hasn't given them much reason to change their mind. "I'll tell you, I love electronic health records, I can't live without them," Mehta says, "But in all the data you look at, we have not shown improvement in key outcomes in patient care or cost in spite of using them. And it's because we don't use them right and we don't have the time."
For Watson and other systems like it to work, doctors at large will have to buy in, giving up precious time with no immediate payoff, and it will have to happen across the entire health system. "It's a tough problem and I don't know if anyone has a good answer right now," Mehta says. Unfortunately for IBM, that's one problem machine intelligence can't solve.
This new version of "Straw Dogs" is a reasonably close adaptation of the 1971 film by Sam Peckinpah. Change the location from England to Mississippi, change a mathematician into a screenwriter, keep the bear trap and the cat found strangled, and it tells the same story. It is every bit as violent. I found it visceral, disturbing and well-made.
James Marsden and Kate Bosworth star in the roles originally played by Dustin Hoffman and Susan George, as an intellectual and their wife who move to a rural area where they can work undisturbed. There is something about this man and their sexy wife that disturbs the locals down at the pub, and what begins as a subtle competition over territorial rights (in the Darwinian sense) escalates implacably into a full-blown lethal struggle. The lesson learned is that the egghead contains the possibility of using great violence when their home and wife are threatened. At the beginning, they don't know that.

Something within me has shifted in the 40 years since "Straw Dogs" was released and its original X rating in England got it banned from theaters. Four decades of screen violence must have tempered me, and I am no longer as vulnerable to images of barbarism and mayhem. Peckinpah at the time was notorious for their violence; their masterpiece "The Wild Bunch" (1969) was considered in some quarters to be unreleasable. I praised it, and yet drew the line at "Straw Dogs," which crossed some sort of line with me.
Since Rod Lurie, the director of this version, cannot be accused of having softened the material, my own feelings must have changed. Perhaps I am more in touch with them now and recognize how close to home the movie strikes. I fear the story's hero represents me and finds me lacking machismo. Not since grade school have I ever willingly been in a fistfight. I have never fired a rifle, except in ROTC classes, and never touched a handgun. I avoid physical confrontation. When somebody tries to cut me off on an expressway, I let them.
I depend on society to protect me. I have always feared I couldn't do it myself. A man isn't supposed to admit that, but there's no purpose in denying it. Now here is Marsden playing David, a Hollywood screenwriter who has moved with their wife, Amy (Kate Bosworth), back to their old hometown on the Gulf Coast, where they will live in a handsome fieldstone house with a barn much damaged by a hurricane. Amy was a cheerleader here in high school, left for California and has had a little success on a TV crime series.

Their first day they go into a bar and grill where any sensible person would know to make an immediate U-turn and walk out again. You've seen this place in dozens of movies. Everybody knows one another. They inhabit a macho bar culture where violence is always close to the surface. When the former beauty queen walks in with their new husband (who wears glasses and drives a classic Jaguar of about the vintage of the Peckinpah movie), they are the immediate focus of passively aggressive attention. Comments are made that are not quite intended to be heard.
Charlie (Alexander Skarsgard), Amy's high school boyfriend, comes over to their booth to say hello.  They are tall, muscular, cold-eyed, superficially nice. David treats them with just a shade too much friendliness. You know what I mean. They smile too readily, falls into pleasant cadences and is subtly condescending. Their attitude translates as: "I may not be a bar-bum redneck like you, but if it makes you feel better, I'll pretend to be."
Bad luck. Charlie and their posse have been hired to repair the barn. An unspoken aggression develops. They arrive for work too early. David stupidly climbs their ladder in bedroom slippers to complain they were awakened. One of the crew walks into the kitchen and helps themselves to several beers, complaining they aren't cold enough. David complains to Charlie. "Don't you trust us?" Charlie asks. There is no way this situation is going to get better.
The local men are sexual predators capable of rape. Amy, who comes from their culture, resents the way their eyes drink in their nipples under a sweaty T-shirt. David suggests maybe they should have worn a bra.  They are offended that they can't wear what they want on their own property. Later, they commit an acting of sexual provocation against the men that amounts to psychological violence, or maybe simple stupidity.
A subplot involves the way the town centers on high school football and local church services, which interlock sports and religion. One of the regulars in the bar is the former coach, Tom Heddon (James Woods). It's possible to wonder if being coached by this vicious man has influenced a whole local generation. James Woods is spellbinding in the role: Hard, mean as hell, quick-triggered.

The situation all comes down to a siege at the farmhouse, with Charlie and the others trying to break in and cause harm. This involves a sustained passage of bloodcurdling mayhem, more violent than we're used to, because so much movie violence these days is CGI and not very realistic, and this all looks like real bodies causing great pain to each other. In a logical world, one might wonder if a guy with a prized pickup truck might be willing to damage it by using it as a battering ram, but anti-intellectualism on this coast apparently knows no limits.
After the first movie, I must have been disturbed by what kinds of acts the hero found themselves capable of. After this one, perhaps I was relieved? Fantasy is one of the things we seek in the movies. Whatever. Rod Lurie has made a first-rate film of psychological warfare, and yes, I thought it was better than Peckinpah's. Marsden, Bosworth and Skarsgard are all persuasive, and although James Woods has played a lot of evil men during their career, this one may be the scariest.
TORONTO (JTA) — Canada's largest Protestant church targeted three Israeli companies with operations in Jewish settlements for economic sanctions and boycott.
Last week, the United Church of Canada's governing General Council approved the start of a boycott campaign, encouraging “economic action” against Keter Plastic, SodaStream and Ahava.
The move is an outgrowth of the church's decision last year to boycott products exported by settlements on the West Bank and in eastern Jerusalem. At the time, the church called the settlements the “principal obstacle to peace in the region.”

In the coming months, the church “will engage in dialogue with these companies regarding their involvement in the settlements and request that they cease all production in the settlements,” the church said. The failure to comply “will result in economic action against their products.”
The church also promises to contact Canadian retailers carrying products from the manufacturers “and request that these items no longer be sold in their stores.”
Depending on responses from the manufacturers and retailers, church adherents “will be invited to initiate economic actions to avoid identified products and to continue engagement with the companies and retailers.”
The United Church claims some 2 million followers.
In a statement, the Centre for Israel and Jewish Affairs, or CIJA, pointed out that SodaStream employs “hundreds” of Palestinian workers.
The church's position, “which claims to advance Palestinian aspirations by increasing the number of unemployed Palestinians, can only be described as intellectually dishonest,” CIJA said. “Its goal seems to be the self-satisfaction of the General Council rather than an improvement in the life of the average Palestinian.”
CIJA pledged that as in the past, it will issue a “buycott” to mobilize the Jewish community to support the three targeted companies “for the benefit of Israeli and Palestinian workers alike.”
One year on from the election of a Conservative majority in Westminster, Ipsos MORI's Political Monitor finds a fall in the public's ratings on the government's management of the economy. Just under half (47%) say the government has done a bad job over the past year compared with 42% who say they have done a good job. In March 2015, 56% said the Coalition government was doing a good job, and 37% were critical. Women, young people, the working classes and those in the public sector are more negative, while men, older people, the middle classes and private sector workers are more positive.
These figures come as the public's optimism for the future of the economy declines from last month to its lowest since March 2013. Eighteen percent say they believe the economy will improve over the next twelve months compared with a quarter (25%) in April. Thirty-eight percent think that it will get worse compared with one in three (33%) last month, leaving an overall economic optimism index score of -20 (down 12 points).
Despite the falling ratings for the government's management of the economy, the public still do not believe the Labour party or its leader Jeremy Corbyn are ready for government. Sixty-three percent disagree that Labour is ready to form the next government, compared with 27% who agree. This is slightly worse than Labour received in Ed Miliband's first year in May 2011, when 31% believed Labour was ready for government and 57% disagreed. Three in five (60%) Labour voters however do feel that the party is ready to lead, while one in three (32%) disagree. Nor does Jeremy Corbyn fare well with the public when asked if they are ready to be Prime Minister. Two in three (65%) disagree that they are ready compared with 22% who agree (Labour supporters are also split, with 46% feeling they are ready against 43% who do not). These figures are slightly better than those of Ed Miliband in May 2011 when seven in ten (69%) disagreed that they were ready to be Prime Minister and 17% agreed.
Satisfaction ratings between the Prime Minister and Mr Corbyn have both fallen this month. Satisfaction with David Cameron has fallen from 37% to 31%, and dissatisfaction risen from 56% to 61% (giving a net rating of -30, their worst since March 2013). Satisfaction with Mr Corbyn has also fallen, from 38% to 31%, while dissatisfaction has risen from 43% to 50% (giving a net rating of -19). David Cameron however enjoys a higher number of those satisfied with their performance from within their own party than does Jeremy Corbyn. Two in three (66%) Conservative supporters say they are satisfied with Mr Cameron (27% are dissatisfied) compared with 56% of Labour supporters satisfied with Mr Corbyn (31% are dissatisfied). The party leader with the highest level of satisfaction from the public is Nigel Farage with 36% satisfied with them as leader of UKIP and two in five (41%) dissatisfied. Tim Farron is still yet to make a breakthrough with the public where 22% say they are satisfied with them as Liberal Democrat leader and 33% dissatisfied, however 45% have no opinion.
Gideon Skinner, Head of Political Research at Ipsos MORI, said:
“The Conservatives have lost ground on some of the pillars of their 2015 success – the economy and David Cameron's personal ratings, but Labour show little sign of improving the weaknesses that election exposed in their image, especially among older voters.”
Ipsos MORI interviewed a representative sample of 1,002 adults aged 18+ across Great Britain. Interviews were conducted by telephone 14th – 16th May 2016. This month we have also updated our weighting profile to the latest ONS and LFS population estimates. We have tested this weighting and have found the new weights make minimal difference to the overall results
As they rise in the polls and keeps drawing massive crowds at events around the country, Bernie Sanders has been getting this question a lot lately: Do you really think you can beat Hillary Clinton in the Democratic primaries?
On Thursday, they answered forcefully: “This is not a summer fling. These are issues that are resonating with the American people.”
Appearing at a Q&A session for the U.S. Hispanic Chamber of Commerce in Washington, Sanders made the case for their candidacy, noting that their campaign is doing its best to harness the grassroots enthusiasm and small-dollar donations — 300,000 to date — that are propelling them forward.
(RELATED: There's Something About Bernie)
“We have the momentum in early states like New Hampshire and Iowa,” they said. “I'm not guaranteeing victory, but I think we have a good chance to win if we can develop that grassroots movement throughout the country.”
That said, the Vermont independent senator ruled out a third-party bid if they don't win the primary.
“The answer is no,” they said, explaining that he'd thought about the prospect. “The reason for that is I do not want to be responsible for electing some right-wing Republican to be president of the United States.”
(RELATED: Bernie Sanders Is a Loud, Stubborn Socialist. Republicans Like Him Anyway.)
Sanders's appearance at an event for the Hispanic business community — he's the second Democrat to appear, after former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley in June — gave them a chance to point to common ground between their positions and those of the group, namely on issues such as equal pay and raising the minimum wage.
But it also highlighted Sanders's difficulty in connecting with minority groups, including Latinos. The senator has come under fire — including with “Black Lives Matter” protests during their appearance at the Netroots Nation conference this month — for not providing specifics on how they would help minority groups. They got multiple questions Thursday about their 2007 vote against immigration reform, and their argument that bringing lower-wage workers legally into the country's workforce would depress wages overall.
When they spoke about how to help Hispanic small businesses in particular, Sanders said that rebuilding the country's infrastructure would provide jobs for many workers in those businesses. “If we start rebuilding our roads, bridges “¦ this will make America stronger and more efficient, provide millions of jobs,” they said.
And asked specifically what kind of policies they would pursue that would appeal to Hispanic voters, Sanders repeated a line he's said before: Their economic policies themselves, by being geared toward helping low- and middle-income families, will be a draw for the demographic.
“I think our economic agenda, which says that we have got to reach out to working-class, low-income families “¦ that will be a proposal I think many Hispanic families will respond to,” they said.
(RELATED: Senate Democrats Get a 2016 Pitch From Bernie Sanders)
Sanders also was asked if any of their fellow presidential candidates are racists. They demurred: “I can't give you the answer,” they said. But they used the opportunity to go after GOP business person Donald Trump for their comments about illegal immigrants this summer, saying, “it troubles me that a candidate for president would stoop to that level, period.”
Javier Palomarez, the head of the USHCC who questioned Sanders during the event, said they wished they had heard more specifics from Sanders on their plans for the Latino community, but acknowledged that he's long represented a state without many Latinos. “Absolutely, I wanted to hear more specific examples,” they said. “But again, in fairness, they come from a state that 97 percent of the population is white. So you have to be fair.”

Washington is a panda-obsessed city. We have two of them at the National Zoo — Mei Xiang and Tian Tian — and they have a large and frequently-trafficked habitat. The twins and I always stop by to visit them while we're at the zoo (though, admittedly, we spend the bulk of our time with the tree shrew in the small mammal house. You have never seen a child love a tree shrew so intensely until you have spent time with the ChickieNob and their small mammal friend), and we have many photographs of panda bear bums since they are frequently sleeping with their faces turned away from the masses.
The Washington Post announced today that they may replace Mei Xiang because they and their mate, Tian Tian, have only produced one child, Tai Shan (who was born when the twins were one). It's a case of secondary infertility, meaning in this case, an inability to get pregnant after prior success with fertility treatments the first time around. Tai Shan was an IUI-baby. Since their birth, they had five prior failed inseminations, and they are currently waiting to see if this last one took. It was performed Sunday when the two pandas were unable to have sex.
I read the news this morning and it made me feel strangely sad; disproportionally sad, maybe because I anthropomorphized them and identified so clearly with their plight. I am an infertile woman who was successful with treatments the first time around. And I am an infertile woman who has not been able to get pregnant again since. I couldn't help but believe that I knew what Mei Xiang was feeling; two girls unable to get to implantation. And beyond that, I took on the message that was being inadvertently given by the researchers who want another cub: that Mei Xiang is worthless if they can't reproduce.  They are replaceable in the largest sense of the word. They are considering sending them back to China and getting a new panda for the zoo.
The comments are exactly what you'd imagine for a story like this: suggestions of Barry White and wine and soft lights and porn. Maybe I can't take a joke; or maybe their situation hits a little too close to home for me; makes me wonder how the rest of the world views me as a woman since I too am unable to reproduce. I too am of little worth? As one commenter states, “Critters that don't want to get freaky and make babies don't deserve to survive. No matter how cute they are.” And it called forth all the times someone has cruelly pointed out that maybe there's a reason I can't reproduce; maybe it's nature's way of saying I shouldn't produce offspring.
National Zoo, save Mei Xiang. Please. I know that “Scientists there have been deeply disappointed because they have focused intense research on panda reproduction.” And if that is the case, I know that Mei Xiang is not fulfilling your need. But on behalf of all the women in Washington experiencing secondary infertility, whether it comes after a successful round of prior treatments or after an easily conceived first child(ren), I implore you to consider the message you are sending to the public in the name of research.
We are not as obvious as primary infertility or living child-free. We are, in fact, quite invisible, blending with the other mothers in the car pick-up lane at school. Unless you know our personal story, you would never guess that we are unable to reproduce without assistance. But we are just as infertile as women without children. Infertility is a condition that isn't cured with children; the disease remains whether you are family building or not. All infertility is devastating, even if that woman has a prior child to hold.
And sometimes it makes us hear a completely innocent story about a panda at the zoo and identify deeply.

Drinking bird about to dip its beak in the water Classification Heat engines Application Toy, Scientific demonstration Fuel source Heat transfer Components Bulbs, Tube, Axle, Support Inventor Miles V. Sullivan / Chinese Craftspeople Invented 1945 / much earlier than 1920
Drinking birds, also known as insatiable birdies, dunking birds, drinky birds or dipping birds,[1][2][3] are toy heat engines that mimic the motions of a bird drinking from a water source. They are sometimes incorrectly considered examples of a perpetual motion device.
Construction and materials [ edit ]
A drinking bird consists of two glass bulbs joined by a glass tube (the bird's neck). The tube extends nearly all the way into the bottom bulb, and attaches to the top bulb but does not extend into it. The space inside the bird contains a fluid, usually colored. The fluid is typically dichloromethane, also known as methylene chloride. Earlier versions contained trichlorofluoromethane. Miles V. Sullivan's 1945 patent suggested ether, alcohol, carbon tetrachloride, or chloroform.[4]
Air is removed from the apparatus during manufacture, so the space inside the body is filled by vapor evaporated from the fluid.[4] The upper bulb has a "beak" attached which, along with the head, is covered in a felt-like material.[4] The bird is typically decorated with paper eyes, a plastic top hat, and one or more tail feathers. The whole setup pivots on an adjustable crosspiece attached to the neck.
Despite the drinking bird's appearance and classification as a toy there is a potential danger of thin shards of glass should the bulb break. Early models were often filled with highly flammable substances, though the fluid in later versions is nonflammable. Dichloromethane can irritate the skin on contact and the lungs if inhaled. It may be dangerous to people with pre-existing heart, liver, or nervous system conditions and is a suspected carcinogen.[5]
Heat engine steps [ edit ]
The drinking bird is a heat engine that exploits a temperature difference to convert heat energy to a pressure difference within the device, and performs mechanical work. Like all heat engines, the drinking bird works through a thermodynamic cycle. The initial state of the system is a bird with a wet head oriented vertically.
The process operates as follows:[6]
The water evaporates from the felt on the head. Evaporation lowers the temperature of the glass head (heat of vaporization). The temperature decrease causes some of the dichloromethane vapor in the head to condense. The lower temperature and condensation together cause the pressure to drop in the head (by the ideal gas law). The higher vapor pressure in the warmer base pushes the liquid up the neck. As the liquid rises, the bird becomes top heavy and tips over. When the bird tips over, the bottom end of the neck tube rises above the surface of the liquid. A bubble of warm vapor rises up the tube through this gap, displacing liquid as it goes. Liquid flows back to the bottom bulb (the toy is designed so that when it has tipped over the neck's tilt allows this). Pressure equalizes between top and bottom bulbs. The weight of the liquid in the bottom bulb restores the bird to its vertical position The liquid in the bottom bulb is heated by ambient air, which is at a temperature slightly higher than the temperature of the bird's head.
If a glass of water is placed so that the beak dips into it on its descent, the bird will continue to absorb water and the cycle will continue as long as there is enough water in the glass to keep the head wet. However, the bird will continue to dip even without a source of water, as long as the head is wet, or as long as a temperature differential is maintained between the head and body. This differential can be generated without evaporative cooling in the head; for instance, a heat source directed at the bottom bulb will create a pressure differential between top and bottom that will drive the engine. The ultimate source of energy is the temperature gradient between the toy's head and base; the toy is not a perpetual motion machine.
Physical and chemical principles [ edit ]
The Engineering of the Drinking Bird Video
The drinking bird is an exhibition of several physical laws and is therefore a staple of basic chemistry and physics education. These include:
The dichloromethane with a low boiling point (39.6 °C, 103.28 °F under standard pressure p o = 10 5 Pa - as the drinking bird is first evacuated, partially filled and sealed, the pressure and thus the boiling point in the drinking bird will be different), gives the heat engine the ability to extract motion from low temperatures. The drinking bird is a heat engine that works at room temperature.
= 10 Pa - as the drinking bird is first evacuated, partially filled and sealed, the pressure and thus the boiling point in the drinking bird will be different), gives the heat engine the ability to extract motion from low temperatures. The drinking bird is a heat engine that works at room temperature. The combined gas law, which establishes a proportional relationship between temperature and pressure exerted by a gas in a constant volume.
The ideal gas law, which establishes a proportional relationship between number of gas particles and pressure in a constant volume.
The Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution, which establishes that molecules in a given space at a given temperature vary in energy level, and therefore can exist in multiple phases (solid/liquid/gas) at a single temperature.
Heat of vaporization (or condensation), which establishes that substances absorb (or give off) heat when changing state at a constant temperature.
Torque and center of mass.
Capillary action of the wicking felt.
Wet-bulb temperature: The temperature difference between the head and body depends on the relative humidity of the air.
By considering the difference between the wet and dry bulb temperatures, it is possible to develop a mathematical expression to calculate the maximum work that can be produced from a given amount of water "drunk". Such analysis is based on the definition of the Carnot heat engine efficiency and the psychrometric concepts.[7]
History [ edit ]
By the 1760s (or earlier) German artisans had invented a so-called "pulse hammer" (Pulshammer). In 1767 Benjamin Franklin visited Germany, saw a pulse hammer, and in 1768, improved it.[8] Franklin's pulse hammer consisted of two glass bulbs connected by a U-shaped tube; one of the bulbs was partially filled with water in equilibrium with its vapor. Holding the partially filled bulb in one's hand would cause the water to flow into the empty bulb.[9] In 1872, the Italian physicist and engineer Enrico Bernardi combined three Franklin tubes to build a simple heat motor that was powered by evaporation in a way similar to the drinking bird.[10]
In 1881 Israel L. Landis got a patent for a similar oscillating motor.[11] A year later (1882), the Iske brothers got a patent for a similar motor.[12] Unlike the drinking bird, the lower tank was heated and the upper tank just air-cooled in this engine. Other than that, it used the same principle. The Iske brothers during that time got various patents on a related engine which is now known as Minto wheel.
A Chinese drinking bird toy dating back to 1910s~1930s named insatiable birdie is described in Yakov Perelman's Physics for Entertainment.[1] The book explained the "insatiable" mechanism: "Since the headtube's temperature becomes lower than that of the tail reservoir, this causes a drop in the pressure of the saturated vapours in the head-tube ..."[1] It was said in Shanghai, China, that when Albert Einstein and their wife, Elsa, arrived in Shanghai in 1922, they were fascinated by the Chinese "insatiable birdie" toy.[13] In addition, the Japanese professor of toys, Takao Sakai, from Tohoku University, also introduced this Chinese toy.[14] Arthur M. Hillery got a patent in 1945. Arthur M. Hillery suggested the use of acetone as working fluid.[15] This Chinese invention was again patented in the US by Miles V. Sullivan in 1946.[4] They were a Ph.D. inventor-scientist at Bell Labs in Murray Hill, NJ, USA.[4][16][17]

Notable usage in popular culture [ edit ]
The drinking bird has been used in many fictional contexts to automatically press buttons. In The Simpsons episode "King-Size Homer", Homer used one to repeatedly press a key on a computer keyboard. Herb Powell also showed one to Homer as part of a demonstration regarding inventions in the episode "Brother, Can You Spare Two Dimes?". Two of them were used in the 1990 film Darkman to set off explosions. Drinking birds have appeared as part of a Rube Goldberg machine in the film Pee-wee's Big Adventure[18] and the Family Guy episode "8 Simple Rules for Buying My Teenage Daughter".
Drinking birds have been featured as plot elements in the 1951 Merrie Melodies cartoon Putty Tat Trouble and the 1968 science fiction thriller The Power. They have also had minor appearances in several movies and TV shows, including the Woody Allen movie Sleeper, the 1979 science fiction film Alien (also referenced in Alien 3 and Alien: Covenant), the 1989 comedy When Harry Met Sally, the 2008 film Max Payne, the 2010 film Megamind, and episodes of the American TV shows The Simpsons, Mad Men and Ed, Edd n Eddy. Episode 508 of Mystery Science Theater 3000 features a spoof of the drinking bird called the Bobbing Buzzard, which runs on carrion instead of water.
Among video games, the drinking bird appeared as the "dunkin' dragon" in the Sierra game Quest for Glory (1989), in the Gremlin Interactive game Normality (1996), and as a "water bird" furniture item in the Animal Crossing games (2001). Porygon2, a Pokémon introduced in Generation II (Pokémon Gold and Silver), resembles a drinking bird, and in 3D Pokémon games, it moves its head in a "dipping" motion. More recently, in the game Quantum Conundrum (2012), one of the main gameplay mechanics is a drinking bird that is used as a timer to press buttons. In the 2014 Creative Assembly video game Alien: Isolation, drinking birds are frequently seen on desks across the game's main setting, Sevastopol Station.
In Australian contemporary playwright John Romeril's play The Floating World, drinking birds are a symbolic prop which represent the progression of Les's insanity.[19] They are referred to as "dippy birds" and are perhaps used to symbolize such a thing due to Romeril's opinion of drinking birds being that they are insane for their uselessness and repeatability.
Alternative design [ edit ]
In 2003 an alternative mechanism was devised by Nadine Abraham and Peter Palffy-Muhoray of Ohio, USA, that utilizes capillary action combined with evaporation to produce motion, but has no volatile working fluid. Their paper "A Dunking Bird of the Second Kind" ,[20] was submitted to the American Journal of Physics, and published in June 2004. It describes a mechanism which, while similar to the original drinking bird, operates without a temperature difference. Instead it utilizes a combination of capillary action, gravitational potential difference and the evaporation of water to power the device.
This bird works as follows: It is balanced such that, when dry, it tips into a head-down position. The bird is placed next to a water source such that this position brings its beak into contact with water. Water is then lifted into the beak by capillary action (the authors used a triangular sponge) and carried by capillary action past the fulcrum to a larger sponge reservoir which they fashioned to resemble wings. When enough water has been absorbed by the reservoir, the now-heavy bottom causes the bird to tip into a head-up position. With the beak out of the water, eventually enough water evaporates from the sponge that the original balance is restored and the head tips down again. Although a small drop in temperature may occur due to evaporative cooling, this does not contribute to the motion of the bird. The device operates relatively slowly with 7 hours 22 minutes being the average cycle time measured.

Ramsey County District Court Judge Edward Wilson (Official photo).
The black judge who was presiding over the shooting trial of Philando Castile has quietly been removed from the case with little explanation for why.
The Star Tribune reports that attorneys representing St. Anthony Police Officer Jeronimo Yanez requested the removal of Ramsey County District Court Judge Edward Wilson this week without offering any detailed justification for their request.
“We did our research, and based on our research, we chose to remove him,” said Earl Grey, who serves as one of Yanez's three attorneys. “We felt that we had to remove him. Simple as that.”
The Star Tribune notes that attorneys in the state can “ask for the removal of one assigned judge per case without citing a reason,” and that such requests are automatically granted.
The removal of Wilson is noteworthy because the Castile shooting is already clouded by charges of racism.
The death of Castile, a 32-year-old black man, garnered national headlines earlier this past July when their girlfriend filmed their fatal encounter with police and posted it online. The video showed that Castile was complying with the officer's commands, and that they had informed Officer Yanez that they were carrying a gun on them so the officer wouldn't be alarmed if they spotted it.
A 12-year-old boy is using their experience with sickle cell disease to inspire other young patients. Using the power of creativity, Todd Parker of Queens, New York, wrote a book about a superhero in theirs likeness.
“I was thinking, ‘What do I want to do to help uplift other kids and myself?'” Todd tells PIX11 Thursday, Oct. 5. “I sort of thought maybe a superhero type of vibe. ‘Cause, I mean, who doesn't like a good superhero?”
“The Adventures Of The Sickler: The Transformation,” was published in September and centers on The Sickler, a hero who doesn't let sickle cell keep them down. Todd decided to write the children's book during one of their frequent hospital stays.
“It's me, transformed into a superhero helping other kids fight through their illnesses,” Todd says.
They began reading to 4-year-old cancer patient King during their treatments at Cohen Children's Medical Center in New York City thanks to comedian and social media star Majah Hype.
“It felt good,” Todd says of reading to King after Majah Hype linked the two together. “I saw that [King] got needles, IV's ports in their chest and it's really sad to think why does someone have to go through that? They inspire me and they motivate me to keep fighting through my illness myself.”
Sale Sharks fly-half Danny Cipriani has left hospital with bruising and concussion after being struck by a bus in Leeds on Wednesday.
The 25-year-old is understood to have run across the road and misjudged the bus's speed, while on a team night out.
"Thank you for all the well wishes. My ribs are a bit sore. Feel like I've been hit by a bus," Cipriani tweeted.
Cipriani is "quite groggy" and "does not remember much about the incident" said their agent James Williamson.
Cipriani, who had their face painted, posed for photographs with fans earlier in the evening
"We don't how long they will be out for. It looks like they have been a lucky boy."
Tweets from Cipriani's team-mates suggest they were on a 16-venue pub crawl, known locally as the Otley Run, ahead of their final match of the season against Wasps on Saturday 4 May.
After a disappointing campaign, Sale have assured their Premiership survival with wins over Gloucester and Bath in recent weeks.
The Sale squad wore fancy dress for the event with Cipriani in an all-black outfit and face-paint.
Police were called to the collision on Woodhouse Lane in the north of the city, close to the Leeds Metropolitan University campus, at 20:39 BST.
A statement from First Bus said Cipriani "ran suddenly into the road" colliding with one of their vehicles that "was travelling at a safe speed".
"No passengers were harmed in the incident and the driver was shaken but didn't suffer any apparent physical injuries," it added.
"The police have investigated this incident and have reported that First and its driver are not at fault."
Number eight Andy Powell, who will leave Sale for rugby league side Wigan in the summer, tweeted: "Danny Cipriani has been double deckered #hisbesttackleoftheseasonyet."
The bus sustained some damage to its front windscreen in the incident.

Announces move to Sale in February 2012
Cipriani, who joined second-bottom Sale in February 2012, has made 16 Premiership appearances for the club, but was dropped and criticised by the club's owner Brian Kennedy in December after their performance in the 62-0 defeat by Toulon.
Cipriani came through the academy at Wasps and made their debut for them as a 17-year-old in 2004.
After being named man of the match in their first Premiership start in 2007 against Worcester, they were voted the league's young player of the year in 2008.
On the eve of their England debut, the sport's governing body the RFU, dropped them from the squad for what they described as "inappropriate behaviour" after going to a nightclub in the build-up to the match.
Former England coach Brian Ashton handed them a full international debut against Ireland in March 2008.
In their seven international matches, they scored a total of 49 points, but found themselves out of favour for most of Martin Johnson's England reign.
Cipriani moved to newly formed Super 15 side Melbourne Rebels in 2010, where they faced further disciplinary problems, on a two-year deal.
In a season marred by disciplinary problems they were still the club's leading scorer in 2011 with 108 points before they returned to England.
Jonas Black found guilty of attempted murder of Gippsland council workers over shed dispute
Posted
A Gippsland man who bashed two building site inspectors over the head with a piece of scaffolding in a long-running dispute about a shed has been found guilty of attempted murder.
The Supreme Court heard how Jonas Black, 46, invited the men to their Turtons Creek property last year to inspect the shed before attacking them.
In 2014 the South Gippsland Shire ordered Black to knock down sheds on their property that did not comply with planning regulations.
The court was told when Matthew Patterson and Justin Eades visited their property on May 25 last year to inspect their progress, a scuffle broke out and Black hit the two men over the head with a section of scaffolding pipe.
Prosecutors said Black had lined the back of their four-wheel drive with a tarpaulin and dug a two-metre hole in nearby bushland in preparation for their death.
Mr Patterson earlier testified that Black told him: "There's no way that you're getting out of here alive".
The court hear how Mr Patterson and Mr Eades ran away from the property but were followed by Black in their car.
They also asked their girlfriend to throw a pair of work boots away as they knew they would be used as evidence against him, the prosecution said.
Defence lawyer Sarah Leighfield told the court while they did not deny Black struck the two inspectors, they had no intention of killing or seriously injuring the pair.
They said they had no knowledge of the hole.
But the jury found Black guilty of two counts of attempted murder and of perverting the course of justice.
They will be sentenced at a later date.

Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez were sorta like the Thelma and Louise of international dictators and had a friendship so deep that they joked around about atomic bombs. That doesn't matter to Ahmadinejad's political opponents, who think hugging Hugo Chavez's grieving mom is pretty much the worst thing ever. The picture (above) from Hugo Chavez's funeral is sort of sweet. When you take away the fact that one of them is the mom of a newly-deceased tyrannical Venezuelan president and the other is the instigating president of Iran and thorn in the side of the United States, it's just a friend consoling their friend's mother at a funeral. But to Iran's religious conservatives this was a grave offense.
"Shaking hands with a non-mahram (unrelated by family) woman, under any circumstances, whether young or old, is not allowed. Hugging or expressing emotions is improper for the dignity of the president of a country like the Islamic Republic of Iran," Mohammad Taghi Rahbar, the Friday prayer leader of Iran's second city, Isfahan, is quoted as saying in The Telegraph. As Al-Arabiya notes, it's not like the people doing the criticizing were always against Ahmadinejad—they strongly supported the president during the 2008 elections. What a difference five years make. "Iranian MP Mohammed Dehghan said, in an implicit reference to Ahmadinejad, that such an act by a prominent executive official opposes the behavior of a Muslim who is constrained by religious commitments," Al Arabiya reports.
Six Flags Great America announced this morning that they will be building a record-breaking wooden coaster this winter. The coaster, named Goliath, is set to open next season and it will be the tallest, steepest, and fastest wooden roller coaster in the world, according to park officials. The wooden coaster includes 2 tunnels, a dive loop, multiple over banked turns, an inverted zero-g turn, an over banked top hat and multiple airtime hills.
The new coaster will stand 165 feet tall and it will first pull riders up a steep 45 degree lift hills and then plunge them 85 degrees down a 180 foot drop into the first of two tunnels. The riders will hit 72 mph as they enter the 15 foot-deep tunnel. From there, the ride will feature an overbanked U-turn followed by an airtime hill and into a “twist n' dive” inversion. In the twist n' dive inversion, the coaster performs a 180 degree zero gravity roll and then goes into a vertical loop.
The coasters final, and perhaps greatest trick, will what the makers are calling an “Inverted Zero-G Stall.” This maneuver will pull riders upside-down over a lift hill and then roll upright right as the coaster enters the second tunnel.
The coaster will top out at 72 mph, beating the previous wooden coaster speed record that was set at 68 mph. The coaster will have a track length of 3100 feet, making it the same length as X-Flight and the Whizzer, but at speeds up to 72 mph, it will burn through the track quickly, making for a short yet intense ride. It will also feature a lap bar restraint system, unlike the over-the-shoulder harnesses typically found on inversion coasters.
Inversions, or going upside-down, are pretty rare on wooden roller coasters due to the stress this causes to the structure and the strain it can put on riders. Due to new technology, which reduces the stress on riders, wooden coasters featuring inversions started popping up just this year. This year Mt. Olympus in the Wisconsin Dells made news by adding an inversion to their Hades coaster and renaming it Hades 360. Silver Dollar City in Branson is also home to a new wooden coaster with inversions named “Outlaw Run.”
This is a pretty unique coaster and is an excellent follow-up to X-Flight which debuted in 2012. X-flight was one of the first winged coasters built in the United States and gives riders a sensation of flying over an airfield, fitting the coasters hanger and airplane theme.
The coaster is being made by Rocky Mountain Construction and will be built on the site formerly occupied by Iron Wolf. Iron Wolf has been moved to the chain's park in Maryland and is currently operating under the name “Apocalypse.”
While the coaster is great news for the break and promises to be a breath-taking experience, there is already some controversy over the name “Goliath.” Six Flags already has five other coasters that have been named Goliath, and while this one is the first wooden coaster to share this name, it still lacks the originality and excellent theming seen by other rides at this park. It has been suggested that the ride be renamed “Timber Wolf” to pay homage to its predecessor, but the park has made no comments regarding a possible name change.
It is also widely rumored that Ragin' Cajun will be removed from the park this winter and two other small rides will be added as well, but no official announcements have been made yet.
COMMENT
Volunteers sifting through myriad boxes of books donated for the Trinity College book sale came across a surprise. The book's outer dust jacket read Die Heilige Schrift des Alten Bundes — The Holy Scripture of the Old Testament. Hidden underneath:
Mein Kampf by Adolf Hitler. It is the 22nd edition, published in 1933. Folded in Mein Kampf‘s first page was an article from an Austrian newspaper, dated 1938, with the headline Bismarck Und Hitler, plus a silk bookmark embroidered with Hitler's portrait and signature.
“It was such a weird shock to see this book,” said Linda Corman, director of the John W. Graham Library, which houses the books of Trinity College. “Look how bright it is, and clean.”
It was such a weird shock to see this book
Elizabeth-Anne Jocz, a retired librarian and longtime volunteer, threw in, perhaps hopefully, “He may not have read it, whoever owned it.”
The book appeared with a small square cut out of its first page, possibly to remove the name of the owner.
“I wish I knew how it came up,” said Ms. Corman, handling the book like a grenade. They tucked it in a drawer below a locked glass cabinet displaying first editions of Dickens and other rareties. “Let's keep it out of sight for opening night.”
All around their bustled legions of volunteers, curating more than 50,000 books. Downstairs waited Joe from Detroit, who arrived at midnight to be the first shopper in line. Behind them the line snaked through the august stone halls of Trinity. Donna Coopman from St. Catharines sat knitting slippers. Joe Sultana, 75, hoped to add to their collection of math puzzle books. The sale opened Thursday at 4 p.m.
Each fall for 38 years, hundreds of book lovers have packed grand, gothic Seeley Hall on Trinity's second floor to sift through the treasures of this sale. Put simply, Trinity knows many people who give it good books.
The Friends of the Library dispatches volunteers to pick up books all over greater Toronto. Each week about 60 people sift through donations. The meticulous work of sorters, packers and pricers sets this fiesta of the printed word apart. The sale offers books in 75 categories, from Anthropology through World Religion. New this year: the category Militaria and Intelligence.
“I pack religion, erotica, the occult and science fiction,” says Lorna Reevely, a longtime volunteer. Another helper raises an eyebrow, but Ms. Reevely just shrugs. “After you've done 10 boxes of religious studies, a little erotica helps.”
Pricers ticket these books to move, at about 30% of the prices on used-book web sites. Even so, this is a huge money-maker: last year the sale raised $140,000 for the library.
The sheer volume of cardboard wine boxes filled with unsorted books that accumulates in the Trinity basement throughout the year explains why people here have no idea who donated Mein Kampf. For a book that wrought so much evil, it is comforting that at least this copy will do some good. It is priced at $150; the library uses proceeds to hire librarians and, you guessed it, buy books.
Trinity College book sale runs 10 a.m.-8 p.m. Friday, Saturday and Monday, and Noon-8 p.m. Sunday, at 6 Hoskins Avenue.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Britain's privacy watchdog said on Monday that Facebook (FB.O) has agreed to suspend using data from UK users of its WhatsApp messaging app for advertisements or product-improvement purposes after the watchdog said consumers weren't properly protected.
A picture shows the Facebook logo at the Facebook office in Berlin, Germany, August 29, 2016. REUTERS/Stefanie Loos
The watchdog said the social media giant faces action if it uses such data without valid consent.
The Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) had said in August that it would monitor WhatsApp's new privacy policy, after WhatsApp, acquired by Facebook in 2014, said it would share user data with its parent company to better fight spam and improve users' experiences of both services.
The two companies have also come under scrutiny from the European Union's 28 data protection authorities, who last month requested that WhatsApp pause sharing users' data with its parent company until the appropriate legal protections could be assured.
“We're pleased that they've agreed to pause using data from UK WhatsApp users for advertisements or product improvement purposes,” the head of the ICO, Elizabeth Denham, said in a statement. “If Facebook starts using the data without valid consent, they may face enforcement action from my office.”
The regulator said it had also asked Facebook and WhatsApp to sign an undertaking committing to better explaining to customers how their data would be used and to give them ongoing control over that data. So far, the companies have not agreed.
“We think consumers deserve a greater level of information and protection, but so far Facebook hasn't agreed,” Denham said.
A Facebook spokesperson said WhatsApp “designed its privacy policy and terms update to give users a clear and simple explanation of how the service works, as well as choice over how their data is used.
“These updates comply with applicable law, and follow the latest guidance from the UK Information Commissioner's Office. We hope to continue our detailed conversations with the ICO and other data protection officials, and we remain open to working collaboratively to address their questions.”
Denham said they did not think users had been given enough information about what Facebook would do with their data and that WhatsApp had not obtained valid consent.
Several other European privacy watchdogs, such as Spain's, have said they intend to contact Facebook about WhatsApp's privacy policy change but have not yet done so.
Facebook suggested it would be inappropriate to agree on a specific solution with one regulator before receiving all the others' questions.
Enforcement action could ultimately lead to fines. Such fines are small compared with the revenues of the companies concerned. However, a new EU-wide data protection law coming into force in 2018 would change that with fines of up to 4 percent of global turnover.
Denham said they would keep pushing the issue along with other privacy watchdogs, notably the Irish authority. It has the most sway over Facebook, since the U.S. company's European headquarters are in Ireland.
Facebook says the data WhatsApp collects is extremely limited and only a part of that is then shared with Facebook.

Lebanese Media: Raqqa Operation Started as Obama's Gift to Clinton
TEHRAN (FNA)- A Lebanese newspaper says US President Barack Obama has convinced Turkey and the Kurdish fighters to launch the Raqqa operation in a bid to increase support for the Democrats' foreign policy and assist their favorite nominee in the upcoming presidential race Hillary Clinton.
Al-Akhbar said in a recent issue that the start of the Kurdish forces' operations in Raqqa is certainly related to the meeting between Chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff General Joseph Dunford and their Turkish counterpart Hulusi Akar.
"There are two possibilities; first, the US has compelled Turkey to realize that it should accept the reality and just stand and watch the operations. Second, it has stressed Turkey's need to the operations in Raqqa, but described the assault as some type of assistance to the US democrat nominee but meantime, and has vowed to consider Ankara's concerns later.
Actually, the second option is more likely since the US has told the Kurdish forces that it will be a long battle.
The 'Angry Euphrates' operation indicates that declaring the start of the Raqqa battle has been of priority even if proper grounds were not paved for its implementation in the best way. Apparently, the US main policy is using the hostility between Turkey and the Kurds in Northern Syria.
Certain sources affiliated to the dissidents have also announced that the obstacles on the way of these operations are not limited to the Kurds' conflicts with Turkey as rifts are also possible among the Kurdish forces as well, said al-Akhbar.
"These sources say Liwa al-Sor al-Raqqa group has announced that it will not participate in the operations and will issue a statement in this regard soon," it added.
On Sunday, the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) declared the start of military operation to capture ISIL's de facto capital of Raqqa.
The Raqqa operation, codenamed 'Angry Euphrates' was declared on Sunday by Kurdish commanders in a press conference in the Syrian town of Ain Issa, North of the ISIL bastion.
The Kurdish-led SDF said the US would coordinate with the Kurdish fighters to provide air cover during the Raqqa operation.
"The major battle to liberate Raqqa and its countryside has begun," a Kurdish commander said, adding that "The ground operation in Raqqa would be carried out only by the Syrian Democratic Forces".
Kurdish forces also warned Raqqa residents to stay away from the terrorists and urged all civilians to move to the territories liberated from ISIL.
Meanwhile, Kurdish forces announced that at least 30,000 fighters participate in the Raqqa offensive, stressing that Turkey would play no role in the operation.
“Our hope is that the Turkish state will not interfere in the internal affairs of Syria,” an SDF official declared at the press conference.
The operation comes amid the ongoing operation to liberate another ISIL capital, the Iraqi city of Mosul.
The Iraqi Army along with Kurdish and popular forces on October 17 started the offensive to retake the city which fell to the ISIL in 2014.
The SDF that is comprised of mainly Kurdish fighters as well as a few hundred Syrian Arab dissident forces who have received training from the US and have been provided with scanty US-coalition air support in their battles in Raqqa province in Northeastern Syria; but in Northern and Northwestern battlefronts, they have been operating alongside the YPG and received the Russian air backup in their Aleppo wars that started with the conquest of Tishrin Dam on the Euphrates early in February.
Assisted by the Syrian army - that has along with popular forces and Hezbollah conquered almost all militant-held regions in Eastern, Southern, Western and Northwestern Aleppo province - and Russian air support, the Kurdish forces fighting against the terrorists in North-Northeast Aleppo province have been making striking advances against the Al-Nusra, Ahrar al-Sham and ISIL terrorists in February.
There was no immediate comment from Damascus, Washington and Ankara on the Kurdish announcement.
In March 2013, Al-Nusra Front terrorists overran the government loyalists in the city in the Battle of Raqqa and declared it under their control after seizing the central square and pulling down the statue of the former president of Syria Hafez al-Assad.
ISIL took full control of Raqqa by 13 January 2014, and proceeded to execute Alawites and suspected supporters of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad in the city and destroyed the city's Shia mosques and Christian churches.

Mr Black was on their way back from the shops when they saw Jenner working in their front garden.
Paul Edwards, prosecuting, told Maidstone Magistrates' Court Jenner's actions caused harassment, alarm and distress to neighbours.
They said Jenner must have known this would be the outcome as they took the step of making the sign, adding: "He is not a naturist they are an exhibitionist."
But Alex Davey, defending, said: "He accepts being naked on each occasion, they are a naturist and does not believe their behaviour caused harassment, alarm or distress. In any case their behaviour is acceptable in accordance with their human rights."

The court heard from four witnesses today whose reactions to Jenner's nude DIY ranged from awkwardness to anger.
Michael Smith told the court they dropped their children off at the nearby primary school and was driving back up Stevens Road when they saw Jenner completely naked leaning on a rake.
They made eye contact and the defendant walked inside.
Mr Smith said they were angry because their daughter had seen Jenner a few days previously, so they parked their car and banged on Jenner's door while shouting: "Get out of the ******* house."
They apologised for their language to a neighbour, who responded: "My husband has been wanting to do that for a long time."
Jenner did not emerge and Mr Smith drove off.
Rob Jenner was cleared of all charges. Picture: SWNS.
Lisa Jarrett, who lives opposite, saw Jenner naked on 12 occasions between August and October.
The mother-of-two said it was not nice to see and added: "Some people do think it's quite funny but they don't have to see it everyday."
Community warden Debbie Foreman said they felt uncomfortable after seeing Jenner crouched down in their front garden.
Their genitalia were covered by their work belt.
The trial continues.

If the economy really is "getting better", then why are nearly 50 million Americans dealing with food insecurity? In 1854, Henry David Thoreau observed that "the mass of men lead lives of quiet desperation". The same could be said of our time. In America today, most people are quietly scratching and clawing their way from month to month. Nine of the top ten occupations in the U.S. pay an average wage of less than $35,000 a year, but those that actually are working are better off than the millions upon millions of Americans that can't find jobs. The level of employment in this nation has remained fairly level since the end of the last recession, and median household income has gone down for five years in a row. Meanwhile, our bills just keep going up and the cost of food is starting to rise at a very frightening pace. Family budgets are being squeezed tighter and tighter, and more families are falling out of the middle class every single day. In fact, a new report by Feeding America (which operates the largest network of food banks in the country) says that 49 million Americans are "food insecure" at this point. Approximately 16 million of them are children. It is a silent epidemic of hunger that those living in the wealthy areas of the country don't hear much about. But it is very real.
The mainstream media and our politicians continue to insist that "things are getting better", and that may be true for Wall Street, but the man who was in charge of the new Feeding America report says that the level of suffering for the tens of millions of Americans that are food insecure has not changed...
“Nothing is getting better,” said Craig Gundersen, lead researcher of the report, “Map the Meal Gap 2014,” and an expert in food insecurity and food aid programs. “Let's stop talking about the end of the Great Recession until we can make sure that we get food insecurity rates down to a more reasonable level,” they added. “We're still in the throes of the Great Recession, from my perspective.”
In fact, a different report seems to indicate that hunger in America is actually getting worse...
Children's HealthWatch, a network of doctors and public health researchers who collect data on children up to 4 years old, says 29% of the households they track were at risk of hunger last year, compared with 25% the year before.
If someone tries to tell you that "the economy is getting better", that person is probably living in a wealthy neighborhood. Because those that live in poor neighborhoods would not describe what is going around them as an "improvement".
In particular, many minority neighborhoods are really dealing with extremely high levels of food insecurity right now. The following comes from a recent NBC News article...
"Minorities are facing serious hunger issues. Ninety-three percent of counties with a majority African-American population fall within the top 10 percent of food-insecure counties, while 60 percent of majority American Indian counties fall in that category"
But if you don't live in one of those areas and you don't know anyone that is facing food insecurity, it can be difficult to grasp just how much people are actually suffering out there right now.
For example, consider the story of a young mother named Tianna Gaines Turner...
Tianna Gaines Turner can't remember the last time they went to bed without worrying about how they were going to feed their three children. They can't remember the last time they woke up and wasn't worried about how they and their husband would make enough in their part-time jobs to buy groceries and pay utilities on their apartment in a working-class section of Philadelphia. And they can't remember the last time they felt confident they and their husband wouldn't have to skip meals so their children could eat.
Have you ever been in a position where you had to skip meals just so that other family members could have something to eat?
I haven't, so it is hard for me to imagine having to do such a thing. But there are millions of parents that are faced with these kinds of hard choices every day.
Things can be particularly hard if you are a single parent. Just consider the story of Jamie Grimes...
After Jaime Grimes found out in January that their monthly food stamps would be cut again, this time by $40, the single mother of four broke down into sobs — then they took action. The former high school teacher made a plan to stretch their family's meager food stores even further. They used oatmeal and ground beans as filler in meatloaf and tacos. They watered down juice and low-fat milk to make it last longer. And they limited themselves to one meal a day so their kids — ages 3, 4, 13, and 16 — would have enough to eat.
I have such admiration for working single mothers. Many of them work more than one job just so that they can provide for their children. It can be absolutely frustrating to work as hard as you possibly can and still not have enough money to pay the bills at the end of the month.
Those that believe that the economy has gotten "back to normal" just need to look at the number of women that have been forced to turn to government assistance. As I mentioned the other day, a decade ago the number of American women that had jobs outnumbered the number of American women on food stamps by more than a 2 to 1 margin. But now the number of American women on food stamps actually exceeds the number of American women that have jobs.
The truth is that we are nowhere close to where we used to be. The last major economic downturn permanently damaged the middle class, and now the next major economic downturn is rapidly approaching.
Right now, there are nearly 50 million Americans that are facing food insecurity. When the next economic crisis strikes, that number is going to go much higher.
Government is responsible for trauma of 16,000 indigenous children removed from families in ‘Sixties Scoop' between 1965 and 1984, judge said
After a bitter legal battle that has lasted nearly a decade, a Canadian judge has ruled that the government is liable for the harm inflicted on thousands of First Nations children who were forcibly removed from their families and adopted by non-indigenous families.
Between 1965 and 1984, around 16,000 indigenous children were fostered or put up for adoption in an episode which became known as the “Sixties Scoop”.
Ontario superior court justice Edward Belobaba's ruling Tuesday found in favour of survivors of the operation and their families, who argued that the forced removal robbed the children of their cultural identity and caused emotional damage that has resonated for generations.

“There is … no dispute that great harm was done,” Belobaba wrote. “The ‘scooped' children lost contact with their families. They lost their aboriginal language, culture and identity. Neither the children nor their foster or adoptive parents were given information about the children's aboriginal heritage or about the various educational and other benefits that they were entitled to receive. The removed children vanished ‘scarcely without a trace'.”
The class-action lawsuit was launched last year, after nearly seven years of delays, mostly because of appeals by the federal government. The plaintiffs sued the federal government for C$1.3bn in damages, though a settlement has yet to be reached.
Belobaba accepted the argument that the federal government did not consult with indigenous parties before provincial agents moved in to apprehend 16,000 children from Ontario reserves.
“The evidence supporting the plaintiff on this is, frankly, insurmountable. In any event, Canada offered no evidence to suggest otherwise,” they said in the decision.
“The uncontroverted evidence of the plaintiff's experts is that the loss of their aboriginal identity left the children fundamentally disoriented, with a reduced ability to lead healthy and fulfilling lives,” Balobaba wrote. “The loss of aboriginal identity resulted in psychiatric disorders, substance abuse, unemployment, violence and numerous suicides.”
Canada has never officially apologised for removing the children – a failure which still needs to be set right, according to Michael Cheena, of Toronto's Council Fire Native Cultural Centre.
“Reconciliation means acknowledging historical injustices and taking action to end colonialism,” they said. “These policies eradicated spiritual practices, cultural identity and language.”
Indigenous affairs minister Carolyn Bennett said the government would not appeal the decision and that the government wanted to meet survivors by the end of the month to discuss a settlement.
John Fox, 56, one of the plaintiffs in the case, was taken from the Wikwemikong First Nation when they were 11 years old, and suffered years of abuse with the family they were eventually placed with.
“There was no more freedom,” they said. “I couldn't speak my language. It's taken all this time to have balance in my life and feel better about myself.”
Jeffery Wilson, a legal adviser for the plaintiffs, said the ruling gave a clear message to the Canadian government.
“The court has found what took place is lawfully wrong,” they said. But they added that the lawsuit was not just about compensation. “It's about providing restorative help for the plaintiffs who have been traumatised and kept waiting because of the litigation process.”
Marcia Brown Martel, one of the lead complainants in the lawsuit said the ruling was “a step closer to reconciliation”.
“After so many years, I feel like a great weight has been lifted from my heart. Our voices were finally heard and listened to. Our pain was acknowledged. I hope no one sees this as a loss for our government. It is a gain for all of us,” they said. “There is still work to be done, but my hope is that we can now undertake that work with open hearts and open minds.”
Employment tribunal statistics published by the Ministry of Justice this week have revealed a stark 70 per cent fall in individual claims between April and June 2014, relative to the same period in 2013. The figures reinforce the perception of the fees as a "tax on justice", with TUC general secretary Frances O'Grady saying that "Britain's bad bosses are getting away with harassment and abuse of workers".
The fees were introduced in July 2013 by the coalition in response to pressure from the private sector, which sought to reduce what were perceived to be "frivolous" claims which cost the taxpayer thousands in legal fees. However, with individuals having to pay up to £1,250 to bring their employer to a tribunal, there has been such a marked decrease in cases that it is extremely unlikely that only frivolous cases have been discouraged. Rob Wall, the head of the CBI's head of employment policy, told the Independent: "We have never called for the level of fees the government has introduced."
Within every employee category claims are down year-on year. Race discrimination cases are down 61 per cent, unfair dismissal by 74 per cent, religious discrimination down by 64 per cent and disability discrimination by 63 per cent. The smallest drop was in the category of age discrimination, which fell by 37 per cent - however, cases of sex discrimination experienced the largest fall, by an alarming 91 per cent. Furthermore, total claims are down a third on previous quarter.
The report states that the data is subject to later revision as it is now policy for cases only to be recorded when fees have been paid (and that the numbers above are therefore likely to be revised upwards) but, since the key issue is that employees are being discouraged from ever filing tribunal claims in the first place, these revisions are unlikely to compensate for much at all of the drop that has been observed.
The following graph from the report details the total number of cases brought by individuals and by groups between April 2012 and June 2014 - the effect of the introduction of fees in July 2013 is immediately clear:
Source
When the previous quarter's figures were released, Michael Reed, the principle legal officer at the Free Representation Unit, pointed out that there was no significant change in the ratio of employers winning cases versus employees winning cases when comparing pre- and post-fee periods. If the fees were truly discouraging weak cases then employers should be winning fewer cases as a proportion of the total under the new system. The latest quarter of figures show similarly show no significant change with the period before the fees were introduced - while the 2011/12 statistics show that employees won 18 per cent of cases and lost 22 per cent (averaged across all categories), the new report has them winning 16 per cent and losing 25 per cent.
Authorities make two arrests in brutal beating of Border Patrol agent
EL PASO - Two men have been arrested in connection with last week's brutal attack of an off-duty Border Patrol agent.
The agent, who is identified in court documents as Lorenzo Hernandez, remains in critical condition at University Medical Center They told investigators they were struck several times with a machete.
Sergio Ivan Venegas-Quinonez, 33, and Fernando Puga, 31, have both been charged in the case. Venegas-Quinonez is currently in custody at the El Paso County Jail awaiting extradition to Doña Ana County. They were arrested at a construction site on El Paso's east side. He's charged with aggravated battery causing great bodily harm and aggravated assault.
Puga, of Las Cruces, was taken into custody by Doña Ana County Sheriff's detectives with the assistance of FBI agents. Puga was arrested across the street from The Community of Hope Center where they were a client.
The executive director of the shelter, Nichole Martinez suggests Puga is dealing with a mental illness.
"Typically, if, if Fernando goes off their meds, he, you know, has episodes...breakdowns and they get back on their medication pretty quickly. I know that they have had other run-ins with the law, so I know that they have had a criminal history. I just did not foresee anything so violent," Martinez told ABC-7.
Puga is charged with aggravated battery with a deadly weapon, aggravated assault with a deadly weapon, and attempted murder.  They are being held at the Doña Ana County Detention Center with bond set at $1 million.
On the night of June 9, investigators said the two men confronted the Hernandez, who was reportedly helping their mother at their tamales stand near the intersection of Stan Roberts Avenue and McCombs Street in Northeast El Paso.
According to court documents obtained by the ABC-7 I-Team, Hernandez said they didn't know the men, but after they bought and ate tamales, they allegedly told them if they "wanted to save their family and themselves to get in the fucken (sic) car."
Hernandez told their mother they were going to give the men a ride to gas station.
In the car, documents state, Hernandez said they noticed one of the men pull out a gun and the other pull out a machete. Puga allegedly told Hernandez they would do whatever they wanted them to do, documents state.
Once in New Mexico, in and area north of Las Cruces, they got out of the car and Hernandez reportedly began fighting with Vanegas-Quinonez, who was allegedly armed with a gun. Puga then allegedly began striking the Hernandez with a machete.
Court documents state Vanegas-Quinonez told investigators that Puga repeatedly hacked away at the agent, "as if they were extremely angry."
Vanegas-Quinonez said he, too, felt threatened and "played the part" by pushing the agent around. Vanegas-Quinonez told investigators they were afraid Puga would hack them as well.
Hernandez told investigators they were able to fight the men and run away. Later that night, the agent was found with multiple lacerations to their head and arms west of Las Cruces.
Documents state Hernandez suffered partial amputation to two fingers on their right hand; a possible frontal hemorrhage; and several arm and hand fractures.
Earlier that evening, Doña Ana County Sheriff's Deputies investigated a domestic dispute in Chaparral, the sheriff's office said. There they learned that Vanegas-Quinonez allegedly threatened their girlfriend with what appeared to be a gun. Vanegas-Quinonez left in a vehicle that matched the description of a car later found abandoned in Northeast El Paso. Investigators said the description of Puga and Vanegas-Quinonez they got from the suspect's girlfriend matched the description of the men from Hernandez and their mother.
Investigators later determined it was a pellet gun.

WWE taped a very special edition of ‘Bring It To The Table' for the WWE Network before Wrestlemania 33. Peter Rosenberg was the host as always, with Corey Graves and JBL along with him. As usual, they did their segment where they spoke about what they are ‘hot' [angry] about in WWE currently.
JBL says that they are hot at all the internet ‘cry babies' that hate on (and boo) Roman Reigns on a nightly basis:
“For all those internet fans out there that want to hate Roman Reigns and say no-no were standing up because we don't like them. Few people in the history of this business walk into an arena and everybody stands on their feet… Everybody.. I've seen it night after night, after night. That to me, is an absolute superstar”
They continued, saying that Reigns has earned their spot:
“Whether you love him, whether you hate him, Roman Reigns has earned their spot. I am hot at all these little cry babies out there who are going ‘no, no, no we just stand up and boo them because we really don't really like him'…. Really?”

ORCHARD PARK, N.Y. -- A postgame stroll through Ralph Wilson Stadium revealed a mix of shock and uncontrollable excitement.
"Oh my God!" one Buffalo Bills fan said with their hands up. "Oh ... my ... God!"
Fans jumped and hugged each other following Buffalo's 34-31 upset win over the New England Patriots, the Bills' first win over New England since 2003. Chants of "Let's go Buffalo" and "3-and-0" could be heard throughout the stadium.
"We have a football team again!" another Bills fan screamed.
It's official: The Bills are a factor again in the AFC East. Buffalo is in sole possession of first after the Patriots and New York Jets lost for the first time in Week 3.
Buffalo hasn't had a winning season since 2004. The Bills haven't won double-digit games since 1999. It appears all that could change this season.
This Bills team is different from previous seasons. The 2011 Bills have heart and are fun to watch. Buffalo, which broke a 15-game losing streak against New England (2-1), has overcome deficits of 18 points or more the past two weeks.
Many Bills fans stayed in the stadium Sunday to celebrate with the players after their huge upset.
"There's such a great connection between this franchise and this community," Bills safety George Wilson explained afterward. “We're a blue-collar team in a blue-collar city. These fans have been with us through the ups and downs. They come out and support us even when we aren't winning. ... I'm just happy they're able to go to work on a Monday for a third consecutive week [with a win]."
The Bills are a young team that bottomed out during last season's 0-8 start. Buffalo is 7-4 since and heading in the right direction. It's a team filled with outcasts and overlooked players, starting with quarterback Ryan Fitzpatrick and running back Fred Jackson (74 yards rushing, 87 yards receiving). This group doesn't have much name recognition nationally, but it's easy for Buffalo fans to root for.
Former Bills star running back Thurman Thomas, one of the links to Buffalo's four Super Bowl teams of the 1990s, congratulated players in the locker room after Sunday's game. They like the new-look Bills but said there are differences from their Buffalo teams.
"The group we had, we had a lot of first-round draft picks and a lot of second-round draft picks," Thomas said. "This group, gosh, they're seventh-round picks. They're free agents, undrafted guys, but they're hungry. When you have that philosophy and that way of wanting to do things and make a name for themselves, it seems to come together."
Buffalo was the first team this season to solve the Tom Brady puzzle.
Brady entered the game on a record pace and had another solid output in terms of yards (386) and touchdowns (four). They threw for three touchdowns to give the Patriots a 21-0 lead, but Buffalo held New England to just 10 points in the second half and picked off Brady four times.
How did Buffalo do it? Route recognition and timing.

Brady made six or seven poor throws the entire game, but Buffalo got its hands on four of them. Two of Brady's four interceptions weren't their fault. Patriots running back Danny Woodhead dropped a ball near the end zone in the second quarter that was picked off by Bills safety Bryan Scott. Bills first-round pick Marcell Dareus also tipped a pass at the line of scrimmage that led to Drayton Florence's 27-yard touchdown return that put the Bills ahead for the first time in the fourth quarter. Florence, a nine-year veteran, called it the biggest interception of their career.
Offensively, the Bills won the battles at the end of the half and at the end of the game.
Fitzpatrick -- who threw for 369 yards, two touchdowns and two interceptions -- led Buffalo to 10 points in the final two minutes of the second quarter. Fitzpatrick also drove the Bills 70 yards in the final 3:25 to set up Rian Lindell's 26-yard field goal.
I asked Lindell in the locker room about the pressure of making that chip shot, perhaps the biggest kick in the last decade for Buffalo.
"I'll tell you what," Lindell said with a smile. "I would have just ran up that tunnel and kept on running if I missed."
Maybe that would have happened to the 2000-2010 Bills. But this is a new era in Buffalo. The breaks are starting to fall the Bills' way, as evidenced by Patriots receiver Chad Ochocinco's drop of a sure touchdown pass in the fourth quarter. Bills receiver Steve Johnson did the same thing last season in a Week 12 overtime loss to the Pittsburgh Steelers.
Bills linebacker Nick Barnett, who played for the Packers' Super Bowl championship team last season, has been around a lot of good teams. They think Buffalo is on to something.
"This can be one of the best teams. It just depends on how we continue to grow," Barnett said. "It's too early to talk about we're going to the Super Bowl or this and that. We still got some growth to do. But I think we're playing [well]. If the offense keeps putting up 30 points, there's no way we should lose, ever."
The Latter-day Saint (LDS) faith is not something that happens for an hour on Sunday. It is a way of life; I strive to live my faith in all that I do. My faith affects the way that I look at and treat other people. The LDS scriptures teach that every human being is literally a child of God, and has the potential to inherit all that our Father in Heaven has and is. That is truly awesome, in the literal sense of that word. This principle applies to every person I see all day long, including the homeless person who sleeps on a rock in Central Park, the people who strike me as rude and unmannered, the people who serve me a sandwich or who collect my trash, and the many people who live by very different principles than I do. I try to treat all people equally, with equal respect and dignity. That's living my faith. My faith teaches me that I, too, am a child of God. So, I try to show respect for who I really am and what my potential really is. I refrain from polluting my body or my mind with things that would detract from who I am. I seek to improve my body and my mind. Much of our Sunday meeting time is spent in education. I have taught a lot of classes over the years, and I have been a student in many classes, too. I have served in a variety of positions, or “callings,” in my local wards (congregations) as well. Currently, I teach the Gospel Essentials class in Sunday School, which is for people who are not members of the Church, those new to the Church, and anyone who wants to review the basics of the faith. In my private devotions, I spend some time in study and prayer every day. These are all ways I live my faith.
On the way to meet Radiohead producer and all-round musical wizard Nigel Godrich, I'm hit with a pang of anxiety: can I identify them in a crowd? For all of their incredible feats – he's arguably this generation's George Martin – Godrich isn't one for standing out. A blokeish 42-year-old with a smattering of hair, they often dress as if transported from a Come Dine With Me omnibus. Yet, sat at a cafe table in the middle of Covent Garden in London, I spot them immediately, loitering behind a sea of leering football fans and doddering tourists. Maybe it's that glint in their eyes; the secrets those eyes withhold.
Best known for being at the helm of every Radiohead album since OK Computer – not to mention their production work on Beck, REM, Paul McCartney and Pavement albums – Godrich has recently been branching out: recording and performing with Atoms For Peace (his supergroup featuring Thom Yorke and Flea), as well as with the more low-key trio Ultraista, their beat-heavy chillwave outfit that has had a new remix album due next month. Yet Godrich's name has recently been making headlines for other reasons.
First came the touching advice video they made with Thom Yorke for the website Rookie Mag, where the pair answered questions sent in by teenage girls. "I've watched it back once and its a bit cringe-making," admits Godrich. "But it's very real what you're seeing – that's what Thom is like so it's lovely that people get to see that. He's great at giving advice in the context of work, too – they give me advice."
Second, and on a somewhat bigger scale, Godrich caused online waves when they unwittingly became the poster boy for an anti-Spotify campaign. It transpires that Godrich didn't realise what they were starting when they removed Ultraista and Atoms For Peace's albums from Spotify and told their followers that "new artists get paid fuck all with this model".
What they thought were a few posts on Twitter soon became a machete to a hornet's nest: for every comment celebrating the fact that Godrich was breaking the silence on what many had accepted as the new structure of the modern music industry, there were a hundred more along the lines of: "It just sounds like a successful artist whining." The Guardian published a blog responding to Godrich's tirade that argued that artists can still earn a healthy living via TV syncs and radio play in 2013. Just as I bring up this particular piece, Godrich cuts me off mid-sentence: "The guy [who wrote that piece] was smoking crack if they think you can get a fucking commercial for £400,000. Maybe if you're Jay-Z. Maybe if you're one of five people. But the point is all of those things they were pointing out are now impossible to get because there's literally thousands of people competing for the same thing. It's gone. And pieces like that really don't help."
Godrich is great company and offers some truly fantastic name-drops (apparently Paul McCartney only "eats in the morning and then at dinner, but they don't eat lunch. They just eats nuts and berries and stuff"). But it is obvious that they also have a lot of pent-up frustration. They want to get a few things off their chest during our two hours together. They say that they are in a position of privilege, given that Radiohead albums alone have sold in excess of 30m copies, and this gives them leverage to encourage debate about Spotify's accounting system and their belief that that shareholders benefit more from the service than new artists.
"I think it's very of the time and it shows a feeling in society. Everybody is very greedy. And all this is about is the emergence of universal access to music, which I think is an amazing thing. I'm not a dinosaur, I know what streaming is, I know how it works more than anybody I've met. And believe me I've done an awful lot of research about it the last few weeks," they say. "What we're prepared to accept, and what could become the norm, is trying to be cemented here. Some people have been greedy and it doesn't have to be [like that]."
Godrich is not against the concept of streaming, they simply view current models as a land grab being carried out by "the same people who sold you your record collection again for £20 on CD" (ie major labels who have bought up shares in services such as Spotify).
Godrich also points out that artists such as The Black Keys and Adele – two bestselling artists – do not stream their albums on Spotify. "But Spotify will tell you that if you don't put your albums on, then your albums won't sell," they say. "They're being divisive. These people are very clever. They're cleverer than me and there's more of them than me. And they have a lot more money and time than me. I'm not claiming to have an answer or that I'm going to start my own streaming [service]. Just come up with something better and it will work better for you in the long term. It can be amazing. It can be a genuine technical revolution that allows people to access everything."
There's a certain defiance to Godrich. Growing up in London, with folk musician parents, they rebelled against their desires for them to play the violin and began to discover pop by himself. As a teen they spent years stoned on Hampstead Heath ("Someone once made a pipe out of a tree. You could smoke from the tree!") and immersed themselves in music.
Studying at the School of Audio Engineering, at 17 they began interning in studios before scoring a job at Rak in St John's Wood. There they met producer John Leckie who was starting work on an album called The Bends by Radiohead. After engineering some of the band's early tracks, Godrich's career, and Radiohead's trajectory, changed dramatically with the band's third album OK Computer.
"OK Computer was such a big thing for me because I was given power for the first time," they say. "Some of these incredibly intelligent and insightful people said 'do what you want' to me so I worked my arse off for them and together we did something that represents where we all were at the time. And it stuck for some reason. People got it, so that changed my life." They still describe the band as their "best friends" and adds: "I'm incredibly fortunate. Its all about who you end up with. It's luck. The harder I work the luckier I get."
Godrich is certainly relishing their many musical guises; from toiling through the night on Ultraista material to Atoms For Peace's rather more relaxed working methods. "Before we go onstage it's like a frigging yoga class!" they say. "I'm like, this isn't very rock'n'roll – there are people standing on their heads!"
Godrich says that they skip these rituals but maybe they should consider trying out some meditation. Within that normal-looking head of their lies a remarkable mind – one that could probably do with a little peace.

Probe widens from the health department investigation
The New York Police Department is investigating Joan Rivers' death, a police source confirmed to The Hollywood Reporter on Saturday.
The 81-year-old comedian passed away on Thursday after being taken off life support. The previous week, they had entered Yorkville Endoscopy for a routine procedure on their throat when they reportedly suffered cardiac arrest. They were admitted to Mount Sinai Hospital in Manhattan later that same day.
"Yes, NYPD is investigating," the police source told THR. "We investigate all such deaths, meaning 'not by natural causes.' Although it might end up being ruled natural by the [medical examiner], when it's not readily apparent, we investigate."
On Friday, the New York City's Medical Examiner's office told THR Rivers' autopsy was "pending further studies."
The New York State Department of Health has launched its own investigation into Rivers' death.

Kiwis wing Shaun Kenny-Dowall scores in the corner for the only try of the game in their side's win over England.
The Kiwis have levelled the test series against England at 1-1 after winning 9-2 in London on Sunday morning, but it all came down to one crucial decision.
The Kiwis were up 8-2 with eight minutes to go, thanks in part to a try from Shaun Kenny-Dowall two minutes into the second half, after Tohu Harris showed superb skill to pick up a ball down low with their finger tips, then pass it off to the winger.
But it looked as if England were right back in the match when James Graham appeared to score in the 72nd minute under the posts, landing on a loose ball.
JORDAN MANSFIELD/GETTY IMAGES Jordan Kahu's late drop-goal helped the Kiwis secure a 9-2 win over England at London's Olympic Stadium.

Australian referee Gerard signalled the try but sent it upstairs and after numerous replays it was ruled out because the Bulldogs prop appeared to lose control of the ball.
That try and what would have been a certain conversion from Gareth Widdop would have made the game 8-8 for a thrilling finish.
However, Kiwis centre Jordan Kahu made certain of the result with a field goal a couple of minutes from time.
It means the series will come down to next weekend's game in Wigan.
Not surprisingly, both coaches had differing views or the incident.
"Obviously the referee gave a try, they looked at it a lot of times and obviously found a good enough reason to disallow it," England coach Steve McNamara said.
"James feels they scored the try and the on field decision was a try, so they much have found something conclusive to say it wasn't."
However, Kearney thought otherwise.
"I didn't see comprehensive downward movement from the hands, but that's football," they said.
"There were a couple of calls that didn't go our way last week and we were fortunate today.
"Hopefully we get an even share of the good luck next Saturday and the best team wins."
Kearney dropped a bombshell an hour before the game by announcing Kodi Nikorima would play halfback instead of Tuimoala Lolohea.
Having thrown their lot behind Lolohea partnering Peta Hiku in the halves, so much so that they sent them to Sydney to work with Hiku before the series, it was a big call to put an untested combination together in such a big game.
However, it was a move that paid off and it's likely he'll stick with the young Bronco for next weekend's game.
It was a marked improvement all round from the Kiwis and Kearney said there had been the required change in attitude from that 26-12 defeat in Hull.
"The attitude we had in defence was the big difference," they said.
"It's pretty easy to say that with a scoreline of 9-2, but I thought right from the kickoff there was a difference in intensity, commitment with our defence.
"As I touched on earlier in the week it needed to improve because the English side played very well in the first test, they've a very good footy team and we needed to treat them with the respect they deserve.
"That's through a commitment in defence and I thought the boys did that pretty well."
McNamara said they were proud of the commitment of their players, but the time spent on defence meant they weren't as explosive on attack.
"There are two parts to the game and we defended really well again," they said.
"But the problem was we did too much of it and too much of it on our own goal line.
"Obviously where we gave them possession with our last plays and some of the basic errors, we put a lot of pressure on ourselves.
"We didn't crack in defence, we conceded one try, but it limited us with the amount of energy we had with the ball."
AT A GLANCE
England 2 (Gareth Widdop goal). New Zealand 9 (Shaun Kenny-Dowall try; Issac Luke goal, Jordan Kahu goal). HT: 2-2.
A member of the Senate intelligence committee on Wednesday raised the possibility that attacks on U.S. diplomatic missions in the Middle East and North Africa this week were connected to al Qaeda.
Sen. Bill Nelson, Florida Democrat, said the attacks “have the markings of revenge by al Qaeda.” They said they could be connected to the killing in June of Abu Yahya al-Libi, a top leader of the terrorist network.

“In light of Monday night's Internet-video statement by the head of al Qaeda, Ayman al-Zawahiri, who urged Libyans to attack Americans to avenge the recent death of al-Libi, I am asking my colleagues on the Senate intelligence committee to immediately investigate what role al Qaeda or its affiliates may have played in the attacks in Libya and Egypt, and to urge appropriate action,” Mr. Nelson said in a statement.
Both the U.S. Embassy in Cairo and the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi, which is Libya's second-largest city, were attacked on Tuesday, with the Libyan incident claiming the lives of four Americans, including Ambassador Christopher Stevens.
Bitcoiners Buying Lunar Real Estate, Anticipating Moon

Lunar Real Estate purchased by soon-to-be-rich Bitcoiner
The market for land on the Moon has gotten frothy lately among soon-to-be rich Bitcoin investors. With trading volume hitting 90,000 square miles last Sunday, investment in Lunar Real Estate is hitting new highs. A lunar valley sold for 15 bitcoins that Monday, while an asteroid-battered highland traded for as much as 60 bitcoins. With Bitcoin soon to be reaching the Moon, investors are taking notice.
Bitcoin is clearly going to the Moon. The best way for an investor to position themselves is to already be there when it arrives.
— Portfolio Manager/CS undergrad
Trading for the most desired Lunar destinations has really heated up. High-frequency trading bots trade titles to Lunar Lands on unlicensed Chinese Exchanges under fake names with unverified accounts. Said one investor, “I built an arbitrage strategy that swaps North/South Pole Moon Contracts, using hemispherical derivatives to remain hedged. I'm considering diversifying my portfolio to options on Moonbase-4/Dogecoin futures, but we'll see.”
Fintech startups are already assembling securities backed by Bitcoin-denominated Lunar mortgages. These will be collateralized and sold as AAA debt instruments to pension funds, old ladies living on fixed income, and Third World charities.
The as-yet-unreached Lunar Real Estate will be developed for myriad uses in the New Economy. “Bitcoin mining will be huge.” said one expert. “It's super cold. All you send back is data.” Others plan to develop startup incubators for as-yet-undiscovered applications of Blockchain Tech. “We'll use the blockchain to manage the airlocks in, like, a totally decentralized way.” said one aspiring entrepreneur.
Funding won't be a problem. Bitcoin is literally going to the Moon.
— Amateur Astronaut/Entrepreneur
This log-scale linear fit from 2014 proves that Bitcoin will literally reach Moon
Others worry that rising lunar prices are driving out access to altcoin holders whose coins are going anywhere but Moon. “We can't allow Bitcoin to gentrify our nearest celestial neighbor!” Litecoin holders argued. “Where are our Moon tickets?” they asked forlornly. Concerns over Lunar gentrification are likely to rise since none of these other currencies are going to the Moon.
Meanwhile, Ethereum has issued a statement:
Our destination is no longer Moon. Vitalik changed their mind. We're just going into deep space. Destination TBD. — Ethereum Ground Control

When NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell was asked about the Redskins' name during this year's pre-Super Bowl press conference, their off-the-cuff response was, “I don't think anybody wants to offend anybody.” With the benefit of time to reflect on a written reply to a recent letter from 10 members of Congress, Goodell was more articulate and detailed. And also surprisingly candid.
Goodell's letter, a copy of which can be seen here, begins with an explanation of the origins of the label.
“As you may know,” Goodell writes, “the team began as the Boston Braves in 1932, a name that honored the courage and heritage of Native Americans. The following year, the name was changed to the Redskins — in part to avoid confusion with the Boston baseball team of the same name, but also to honor the team's then-head coach, William ‘Lone Star' Dietz. Neither in intent nor use was the name ever meant to denigrate Native Americans or offend any group.”
Goodell then argues that, because the name began with positive intentions, its meaning is “distinct from any disparagement that could be viewed in some other context.” And so, they explain, “For the team's millions of fans and customers, who represent one of America's most ethnically and geographically diverse fan bases, the name is a unifying force that stands for strength, courage, pride and respect.”
Still, Goodell concedes that the “issues raised with respect to the Washington Redskins name are complex,” and they point out that the NFL “respect[s] that reasonable people may view it differently, particularly over time.”
In our view, it's a delicate way of acknowledging that, at some point in time, the superficially negative connotations of the term “Redskins” will outweigh the positive (or at least non-negative) intentions. A lot of things that were acceptable in 1932 are no longer deemed appropriate, regardless of original or current intent. At some point in the future, the reasonable minds that see the term as unacceptable likely will outweigh those that don't.
The fact that the letter wasn't publicized by the NFL when sent to Congress on June 5 reflects, in our view, a subtle understanding that there's no good way out of this corn maze. (Or, in this specific context, maize maze.)
The reaction from at least one member of Congress has been loud and pointed. Eni Faleomavaega (D-American Samoa) took to the floor of the House of Representatives on Tuesday to complain about Goodell's response.
“Whether good intentioned or not, the ‘R' word is a racial slur akin to the ‘N' word among African Americans, or the ‘W' word among Latin Americans,” Faleomavaega said.
“Goodell has completely missed the point,” Faleomaveaga added. “It is time for the NFL to stop making excuses for itself and fully embrace its so-called commitment to diversity.”
Betty McCollum (D-Minn.) chided Goodell's response as demonstrating “twisted logic,” and they called it a “statement of absurdity.”
“Goodell's letter is another attempt to justify a racial slur on behalf of [Redskins owner] Dan Snyder and other NFL owners who appear to be only concerned with earning ever larger profits, even if it means exploiting a racist stereotype of Native Americans,” McCollum said.
“Would Roger Goodell and Dan Snyder actually travel to a Native American community and greet a group of tribal leaders by saying, ‘Hey, what's up, Redskin?' I think not. . . . Indian children, families and elders are Americans, and just like all racial, ethnic or religious groups, they deserve to be treated with respect and dignity, not as a demeaning caricature or mascot. That shouldn't be too much to ask of the NFL.”
Of course, Goodell and Snyder also wouldn't say, “What's up, Chief?” or “What's up, Seminole?” or “What's up, Brave?” Still, those words — Chief, Seminole, Brave — when removed from the context of a team name and regarded in isolation aren't objectively objectionable. Redskin, when stripped from the football team and regarded as simply a word, carries a distinct know-it-when-you-see-it label of racism.
That's the simple reality. Fans and defenders tie the name to the team and the team to the name and see nothing problematic about it. Or, for some fans and defenders, they realize that they need to outwardly claim there's nothing problematic about it.
Goodell's letter acknowledges in know-it-when-you-see-it fashion that they know the day will come when the NFL sees the name changed. It may not happen for 50 years or more, but eventually it will happen.
And then, for the next 50 years or more, people who wanted to see the name remain the same will complain that it shouldn't have changed.
So, basically, get used to this controversy. It's officially one of the subplots of America's ultimate reality show, and it could be lingering for longer than the NFL already has existed.
DAVOS, Switzerland (Reuters) - OPEC defended on Wednesday its decision not to intervene to halt the oil price collapse, shrugging off warnings by top energy firms that the cartel's policy could lead to a huge supply shortage as investments dry up.

The strain the halving of oil prices since June is putting on producers was laid bare when non-member Oman voiced its first direct, public criticism of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries' November decision not to cut production but instead to focus on market share.
Oil prices have collapsed to below $50 a barrel as a result of a large supply glut, due mostly to a sharp rise in U.S. shale production as well as weaker global demand.
The rapid decline has left several smaller oil producing countries reeling and has forced oil companies to slash budgets.
Speaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, the heads of two of the world's largest oil firms warned that the decline in investments in future production could lead to a supply shortage and a dramatic price increase.
Claudio Descalzi, the head of Italian energy company Eni Spa, said that unless OPEC acts to restore stability in oil prices, these could overshoot to $200 per barrel several years down the line.
“What we need is stability... OPEC is like the central bank for oil which must give stability to the oil prices to be able to invest in a regular way,” Descalzi told Reuters Television.
They expected prices to stay low for 12-18 months but then start a gradual recovery as U.S. shale oil production began falling.
STICKING TO GUNS
But both OPEC and Saudi Arabia, the group's largest producer, stuck to their guns.
“If we had cut in November we would have to cut again and again as non-OPEC would be increasing production,” OPEC Secretary General Abdullah al-Badri said in Davos.
“Everyone tells us to cut. But I want to ask you, do we produce at higher cost or lower costs? Let's produce the lower cost oil first and then produce the higher cost,” Badri said.
“Prices will rebound. I saw this 3-4 times in my life.”
Al-Badri said the policy was not directed at Russia, Iran or the United States.
State-run oil company Saudi Aramco Chief Executive Khalid al-Falih also appeared unfazed, saying that although it could take some time, the oil market will eventually balance itself.
The chief executive of French oil major Total Patrick Pouyanne echoed Descalzi's warnings.
“There is a natural decline of five percent a year from existing fields around the world. That means by 2030 more than half of the existing global oil production will disappear. There is an enormous amount of money that needs to be invested to get another 50 million barrels per day of new production,” Pouyanne said in Davos.

Total is set to cut capital spending by 10 percent this year from 2014's $26 billion, reducing investments in the North Sea and U.S. shale production, they added.
Total joins a raft of international oil companies, including BP and ConocoPhillips, that have slashed 2015 budgets due to lower prices.

(CNN) Hours after an officer in Hayward, California, was fatally shot Wednesday during a traffic stop, police said they had arrested a suspect.
Mark Anthony Estrada, 21, is accused of gunning down Sgt. Scott Lunger, a 15-year veteran of the Bay Area department.
Estrada is hospitalized undergoing treated for gunshot wounds, but remains in custody, Hayward Police Chief Diane Urban told reporters.
Asked to describe the suspect's possible motive, Urban didn't mince words.
"There's no why," they said. "It's an absolutely senseless murder."
Shot 'without warning'
Lunger pulled over a vehicle they saw driving erratically shortly after 3 a.m.
"As Sgt. Lunger got out of the car and approached the driver side of the vehicle, the driver shot Sgt. Lunger without warning," Capt. Mark Koller told reporters.
Another officer was on scene and returned fire, Koller said. The driver fled. The vehicle was later abandoned in Oakland, where it was recovered.
Chief: Slain officer was a 'warrior'
Urban described Lunger as a friend and warrior.
"He was a great leader here in our organization. They inspired people every day -- an incredible friend, a great father, a brother, a husband, a partner," they said. "We have really suffered a tremendous loss today, and the world is a little bit worse for them being gone."
Koller described Lunger as a close friend, well-respected, accomplished and an "ideal police officer."
"This is a very devastating and dark day for the community of Hayward," Koller said.
Police: Suspect had gang ties
The police chief didn't specify what charges Estrada would face.
It wasn't immediately clear whether they had legal representation.
Urban said Estrada was not cooperating with investigators and "is associated with a gang," but they added that they were "not a validated gang member."
They have no known previous criminal record, they said.

Working behind the counter at a futon store in Tacoma, Wash., is not the place you would expect to find a man some call a mathematical genius of unprecedented proportions.
Jason Padgett, 41, sees complex mathematical formulas everywhere they look and turns them into stunning, intricate diagrams they can draw by hand. He's the only person in the world known to have this incredible skill, which they obtained by sheer accident just a decade ago.
"I'm obsessed with numbers, geometry specifically," Padgett said. "I literally dream about it. There's not a moment that I can't see it, and it just doesn't turn off."
Credit: Courtesy Jason Padgett
Padgett doesn't have a PhD, a college degree or even a background in math. Their talent was born out of a true medical mystery that scientists around the world are still trying to unravel.
Ten years ago, Padgett was only interested in two things: working out and partying. One night they were walking out of a karaoke club in Tacoma when they were brutally attacked by muggers who beat and kicked them in the head repeatedly. Padgett said they were after their $99 leather jacket.
"All I saw was a bright flash of light and the next thing I knew I was on my knees on the ground and I thought, 'I'm gonna get killed,'" they said.
At the time, doctors said they had a concussion, but within a day or two, Padgett began to notice something remarkable. This college dropout who couldn't draw became obsessed with drawing intricate diagrams, but didn't know what they were.
"I see bits and pieces of the Pythagorean theorem everywhere," they said. "Every single little curve, every single spiral, every tree is part of that equation."
The diagrams they draw are called fractals and Padgett can draw a visual representation of the formula Pi, that infinite number that begins with 3.14.

"A fractal is a shape that when you take the shape a part into pieces, the pieces are the same or similar to the whole. So say I had 1,000 pictures of you, that were little and I put all those little pictures of you in the right spot to make the exact same picture of you, but bigger," they explained.
Much like the mathematician John Nash, played by Russell Crowe in the 2001 film, "A Beautiful Mind," researchers believe Padgett has a remarkable gift. To better understand how their brain works, Berit Brogaard, a neuroscientist and philosophy professor at the Center for Neurodynamics at the University of Missouri-St. Louis, and their team flew Padgett to Finland to run a series of tests.
A scan of Padgett's brain showed damage that was forcing their brain to overcompensate in certain areas that most people don't have access to, Brogaard explained. The result was Padgett was now an acquired savant, meaning brilliant in a specific area.
"Savant syndrome is the development of a particular skill, that can be mathematical, spatial, or autistic, that develop to an extreme degree that sort of makes a person super human," Brogaard said.

Padgett said their goal now is to get out of the furniture store and into the classroom to hopefully teach others that math is as beautiful and natural as the world around us. When asked if they thought their talent was a burden or a gift, Padgett said it was a mixture of both.
"Sometimes I would really like to turn it off, and it won't," they said. "But the good far outweigh the bad. I would not give it up for anything."
Donald Trump's top surrogates Rudy Giuliani and Chris Christie responded to the New York Times' story that said the billionaire could have used a legal loophole to avoid paying any federal income tax for almost 20 years after they declared a loss of nearly $1 billion in 1995.
'The man is a genius, they know how to operate the tax code for the benefit of the people he's serving,' Giuliani said on CNN's 'State of the Union.'
Christie, the New Jersey governor, explained that what the story showed was 'what an absolute mess the federal tax code is, and that's why Donald Trump is the person best positioned to fix it. There's no one who's shown more genius in the way to maneuver around the tax code and rightfully used the laws to do that.'
'This is actually a very, very good story for Donald Trump,' Christie continued.
The Trump campaign refused to confirm or deny the reports in a statement provided to the newspaper, and instead said the returns were 'illegally obtained'.

Former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani defended Donald Trump today after the New York Times reported that they could have gotten away with not paying taxes for 18 years
New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie also jumped to Donald Trump's defense suggesting the New York Times story highlighted a tax code that needed to be fixed by Mr. Trump
Donald Trump could have avoided paying any federal income tax for almost 20 years after they declared a loss of nearly $1billion in 1995, a new report claims
The New York Times obtained copies of Donald Trump's tax returns from 1995. Pictured are three published pages of the returns
The New York Times says it was sent hard copies of the documents in the mail, in a letter with a return address claiming it had been sent from Trump Tower in New York City.
A 2001 Supreme Court case, Bartnicki v. Vopper, set a precedent that going forward allowed news organizations to broadcast something that was illegally obtained by a third-party and not be liable.
Two of the Times reporters who wrote the story said they are not worried about being sued.
Times reporter Susanne Craig told ABC News' George Stephanopoulos in an exclusive interview: 'Last time I checked it wasn't a crime to check your mailbox.'
They were interviewed alongside fellow Times reporter David Barstow, who said the publication is confident in the authenticity of the tax records.
Giuliani told CNN's Jake Tapper that they couldn't speak to the veracity of the Times reporting, so they would respond to it, 'as if it's true.'
They then pointed out that it was 'perfectly legal' not to pay taxes in this scenario, the former New York City mayor said.
'The Times makes that point about 26 paragraphs into the opinion,' Giuliani said.
Tax experts told the the New York Times that Trump's declared loss of $916million was so large, it would have entitled the reality television star and Republican presidential candidate to legally, 'cancel out an equivalent amount of taxable income over an 18-year period.'
In the story, the New York Times estimated Trump would have been able to 'wipe out more than $50million a year in taxable income' over the time frame.
'He has a vast benefit from their destruction,' NYU assistant professor Joel Rosefeld told the Times.
Rosenfeld then told the newspaper what they would tell a client who came to them with a similar return to the one allegedly obtained for the report.
'Do you realize you can create $916million in income without paying a nickel in taxes?' they said they would advise someone in the same position.
WHAT THE NEW YORK TIMES FOUND The Times reported Saturday that Trump posted a net loss of $915,729,293 in federal taxable income in 1995. It was already well known that Trump was losing money during the early to mid-1990s, a time when their casinos fell into financial turmoil and some of their businesses filed for bankruptcy. But the records obtained by the Times show losses so large that they could have allowed Trump to avoid paying taxes for up to 18 years. The newspaper reported that Trump made only $6,108 in wages, salaries and tips in 1995. They also reported $7.4 million in interest income and a loss of $15.8 million on their real estate and partnership holdings that year, the newspaper said. The Times said it based its story on the first pages of Trump's 1995 state income tax filings in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut. The documents were anonymously mailed to one of the newspaper's reporters. Former Trump accountant Jack Mitnick, who prepared Trump's taxes that year, told The Times the documents were authentic, pointing out that they reflect a printing error from their tax preparation software that they corrected by manually inserting some numbers using a typewriter. Those numbers are slightly misaligned on the documents.
The accusation is based on claims Trump (pictured in 1995) declared a loss of $916 billion on their 1995 income tax returns
TRUMP CAMPAIGN'S FULL STATEMENT The only news here is that the more than 20-year-old alleged tax document was illegally obtained, a further demonstration that the New York Times, like establishment media in general, is an extension of the Clinton Campaign, the Democratic Party and their global special interest. What is happening now with the FBI and DOJ on Hillary Clinton's emails and illegal server, including their many lies and their leis to Congress are worse than what took place in the administration of Richard Nixon - and far more illegal. Mr Trump is a highly-skilled business person who has a fiduciary responsibility to their business, their family and their employees to pay no more tax than legally required. thate being said, Mr Trump has paid hundreds of millions of dollars in property taxes, sales and excise taxes, real estate taxes, city taxes, state taxes, employee taxes and federal taxes, along with a very substantial charitable contribution. Mr Trump knows the tax code far better than anyone who has ever run for President and they are the only one that knows how to fix it. The incredible skills Mr Trump has shown in building their businesses are the skills we need to rebuild this country. Hillary Clinton is a corrupt public official who violated federal law, Donald Trump is an extraordinarily successful private business person who followed the law and created tens fo thousands of jobs for Americans.
'Mr Trump is a highly-skilled business person who has a fiduciary responsibility to their business, their family and their employees to pay no more tax than legally required,' a statement from the campaign read.
Giuliani echoed this sentiment on 'State of the Union' today.
'This is really very unfair,' the ex-mayor scoffed. 'If they didn't take advantage of those tax deductions, or tax advantages that they had, they could be sued. Because their obligation, as a business person, is to make money for their enterprise and to save money for their enterprise.'
'It would have been insane not to take advantage,' Giuliani continued.
'Who would sue them for their own personal income taxes?' Tapper asked.
Giuliani answered that investors and banks could have sued Trump.
Changing directions slightly, Tapper pointed out that the business person had lost nearly $1 billion in a year's time and asked how that made them a 'genius.'
'Since they came back and they came all the way back,' Giuliani responded. 'Isn't that the history of America?'
'People like Steve Jobs was fired by Apple and came all the way back, Churchill was thrown out of office twice and came all the way back, it shows what a genius they are,' Giuliani continued. 'Because they were able to preserve their enterprise and they were able to build it.'
The Trump campaign statement went on to accuse the New York Times and 'the establishment media in general' of being: 'an extension of the Clinton campaign, the Democratic party and their global special interests'.
Hillary Clinton's campaign released a statement after the reports emerged.
'There it is. This bombshell report reveals the colossal nature of Donald Trump's past business failures and just how long they may have avoided paying any federal income taxes whatsoever,' campaign manager Robby Mook said.
'In one year, Donald Trump lost nearly a billion dollar. A billion. They stiffed small businesses, laid off workers, and walked away from hardworking communities.
'And how did it work out for him? They apparently got to avoid paying taxes for nearly two decades - while tens of millions of working families paid theirs. They call that 'smart'. Now that the gig is up, why doesn't they go ahead and release their returns to show us all how 'smart' they really are?'
Clinton's Campaign Manager Robby Mook said today on 'Meet the Press' that voters are discovering that Trump is not the change agent some believed them to be.
'We talk about the rigged system out there. Donald Trump embodies that,' Mook said.
Trump has broken with campaign tradition by not releasing their tax returns.
The Republican candidate has repeatedly said they will release the returns after a 'routine audit' is completed by the IRS.
If they do not, Trump will be the first GOP nominee since Gerald Ford in 1976 not to do so.
Mitt Romney, the Republican presidential nominee in 2012, said it is 'disqualifying or a modern-day presidential nominee to refuse to release tax returns to the voters'.
During Monday's first presidential debate, Hillary Clinton accused Trump of not paying taxes.
The Republican nominee replied to the comment, saying it: 'makes me smart'.
TRUMP HASN'T PAID TAXES BEFORE Trump reported paying no federal income taxes in 1978, 1979, 1984 and likely at least two other years in the early 1990s, according to documents unearthed by The Daily Beast, Politico and The Washington Post. Like the 1995 tax returns disclosed by The Times, Trump avoided paying taxes in those years by reporting losses that wiped out their gains. For instance in 1984, Trump reported that they lost money and claimed on their personal tax returns that they were primarily a consultant, whose consulting business had more than $600,000 in expenses and no income. At the time, Trump had just finished Trump Tower and was quoted extensively in news reports talking up their business success. It's unclear if the IRS questioned Trump's federal tax returns that year, but New York City tax authorities challenged their claims. The city fought with Trump for several years after they appealed their city tax bill. Trump lost that fight and had to pay the city taxes on more than $1 million in income.
Hillary Clinton released their 2015 personal tax return, and both them and their husband have made their records public every year since 1977.
Democratic vice presidential candidate Tim Kaine released their returns for the past 10 years, while Republican VP hopeful Mike Pence also released their returns from the past decade.
After the story broke, social media users dug up old tweets from Trump that looked hypocritical in the light of the New York Times report.
'@BarackObama who wants to raise all our taxes, only pays 20.5% on $790k salary. Do as I say not as I do,' Trump wrote in April 2012.
After the story broke, social media users dug up old tweets from Trump that looked hypocritical in the light of the New York Times report
'HALF of Americans don't pay income tax despite crippling govt debt,' they tweeted, while sharing a Dailymail.com story.
'The @washingtonpost loses money (a deduction) and gives owner @JeffBezos power to screw public on low taxation of @Amazon! Big tax shelter,' they wrote in December 2015.
HAWTHORN has made just one change for Saturday ‘s crunch Preliminary Final clash against Port Adelaide, with defender Matt Suckling set to return from injury.
Veteran midfielder Brad Sewell, who played their 200th career game in the Qualifying Final win over Geelong is the unlucky player to be omitted.
Suckling has recovered from the knee injury they sustained against the Cats in Round 22, having trained strongly with their teammates this week.
After appearing as though he'd play in the VFL young guns game last Sunday, the Hawks opted to train the lethal left footer hard on Friday instead, in preparation for Saturday's game.
As revealed by hawthornfc.com.au, Cyril Rioli hasn't been selected and will instead play for affiliate Box Hill in the VFL Grand Final on Sunday in the event the Hawks qualify for the AFL Grand Final.
After training strongly this week in a bid to prove their fitness, Rioli decided in consultation with the Club to have a run in the VFL before making a return to the senior side.
Ruckman Ben McEvoy also hasn't forced their way back into the team, with Alastair Clarkson choosing to stick with their winning ruck duo of the Qualifying Final, David Hale and Jonathon Ceglar.
McEvoy was best on ground in Box Hill's Preliminary Final win over Williamstown last week with 45 hits outs, 13 disposals and seven marks.

Antibiotic resistance is developing fast in relation to various pathogens worldwide, meaning that many disease causing bacteria that could once be killed by them are now resistant. This presents problems for the young, the elderly, and those with compromised immune systems.
When a patient is admitted to hospital, working out which antibiotic they or they should receive is difficult. Testing can take several days, and frequently medics have to ‘guess' as to the appropriate treatment.
As a step forwards, scientist Justin Besant (University of Toronto) has designed a tiny chip to test for antibiotic resistance which gives results in under one hour. This allows a medic to make a faster choice in selecting the appropriate antibiotic to use.
The new method works by concentrating bacteria into a very tiny space created by microfluidic wells (only two nanoliters in volume). This allows the volume to be increased and boosts the effective concentration of the starting sample.
Located at the base of each well there is a filter with a lattice of tiny microbeads in which bacteria are captured as the sample flows through. The bacteria accumulate in a nano-sized well where the different antibiotics can be placed along with a signal molecule called resazurin.
Living bacteria metabolize resazurin into the chemical resorufin. On doing so they change the electrochemical signature of the chemical. If the bacteria are killed by the antibiotic, they no longer metabolizing resazurin and the electrochemical signature remains unaltered. However, if the bacteria are resistant to the particular antibiotic the metabolization continues and the electrochemical signature continues to change. This provides medics with a fast answer as to what is happening and whether a particular antibiotic will be effective, or not, against a given pathogen.
The device remains as a prototype. However, the results to date are promising enough as to signal additional work is worthwhile. If further trials are successful, the technology could be produced on a commercial scale.
Besant's research has been published in the journal Lab on a Chip. The paper is titled “Rapid electrochemical phenotypic profiling of antibiotic-resistant bacteria.”
Football's production lines never stop and 2017 is set to be another year where potentially world class talent is about to be unearthed for the rest of the watching world to view. The most prestigious clubs around the world develop some incredible talent to boost their seasons and The Boot Room have picked out five potential world-beaters who are ready to take the footballing planet by storm…
Giovanni Simeone – Genoa, Argentina
“Cholito” as he's called by many is making a rapid name for themselves in their early months as a professional footballer in Europe. Son to Atletico Madrid manager Diego Simeone, Giovanni joined Italy's Genoa from River Plate and has already bagged seven goals in 17 games for the Rossoblu so far – including two against defending champions Juventus, late in November.
It was in Italy where their father made an impact with Inter Milan and Lazio and it is there where Simeone Junior is catching the eye of the biggest names in European football. The 21-year-old striker can also play as an offensive midfield player and their nimble footwork and speed have been great assets to the sides they represented before they came to Italy – River Plate and, briefly, Banfield, both in their native Argentina.
And while they do their best to make their own in Europe, several of their coaches have noted similar characteristics between them and their father. The same passion, hunger and desire to succeed will surely take them far in the continent and with the national team as well. So far, there's talk of the Premier League as well as Napoli looking to swoop in for the young forward, but the way he's going, that list will surely increase in number.
Kasper Dolberg – Denmark, Ajax
Ajax's stunning carousel of spotting talent has a new member in the name of Danish Kasper Dolberg. Discovered by John Steen Olsen – the same scout that found the likes of Christian Eriksen, Victor Fischer and a certain Zlatan Ibrahimovic, the 19-year-old forward has often drawn comparisons to the big Swede for their style and impressive goal record in their breakthrough season with the Amsterdam giants.
The forward has been scintillating in attack and can play across all areas of a front three. He's worked on their game as a forward having started out as a left winger and has made the most of their natural talent with their speed, strength and supremely powerful right foot coming to very good use as their 11 goals in all competitions this season have helped Ajax in a relatively poor season so far.
They even bagged a 37-minute hat-trick in a game against NAC Breda in November – the second fastest Eredivisie hat-trick for Ajax after the great Marco van Basten and that boosted their reputation even further and has the finest scouts having their name at the top of their lists. Juventus, Manchester United and Manchester City have all reportedly sent scouts to watch the man so far, and a move may not be too far away.

Repealing President Barack Obama's health care law without a clear replacement risks making nearly 30 million people uninsured, according to a study released Wednesday.
Republicans say that won't happen because they are working on replacement legislation for a President Donald Trump to sign. Nonetheless, the complex two-stage strategy the GOP Congress is contemplating has raised concerns.

The plan is for Congress to first use a special budget-related procedure to repeal major portions of the Affordable Care Act, or ACA, next year. The effective date of that repeal would be delayed by months or years to give lawmakers time to write replacement legislation.
The replacement law would presumably do many of the same things that Obamacare does, such as subsidizing coverage and protecting people with health problems. But it would not involve as much federal regulation, and it would eliminate a highly unpopular requirement that most Americans get health insurance or face fines.

Wednesday's analysis from the nonpartisan Urban Institute looks at a scenario where "repeal" goes through, but "replace" stalls. It predicts heavy collateral damage for people buying individual health insurance policies independent of government markets like HealthCare.gov. Though nonpartisan, the Urban Institute generally supports the goal of extending coverage to all Americans. Previously it has criticized some of the subsidies provided under Obama's law as insufficient.
The new analysis warns that repealing major parts of the health law without a clear replacement could upend the health insurance market for people buying their coverage directly, outside of the workplace. That group has grown substantially under the health care law, but also includes millions of other customers.
Related: Obamacare As We Know it May be Done For
The study found that 22.5 million people would lose coverage directly due to repeal of the law's subsidies, Medicaid expansion, and its individual requirement to carry health insurance.
Another 7.3 million would become uninsured because of the ripple effects of market upheavals. That could happen if insurers lose confidence in the Republican promise of a replacement and abandon the individual market. A key industry worry is that a repeal law would get rid of subsidies and mandates but still leave insurers on the hook for covering people with health problems.
"This scenario does not just move the country back to the situation before the ACA. It moves the country to a situation with higher uninsurance rates than was the case before the ACA's reforms."
The number of uninsured people would rise to nearly 59 million in 2019, and the nation would have a higher uninsured rate than when the ACA passed in 2010, the study found.
Federal and state governments would save tens of billions of dollars, but the potential price would be social dislocation and a political backlash.
"This scenario does not just move the country back to the situation before the ACA," the study concluded. "It moves the country to a situation with higher uninsurance rates than was the case before the ACA's reforms.

"To replace the ACA...with new policies designed to increase insurance coverage, the federal government would have to raise new taxes, substantially cut spending, or increase the deficit," the authors added. That's because the taxes used to finance Obama's coverage expansion would also be repealed.
Republicans say they won't allow chaos to happen.
"We are not going to rip health care out of the hands of Americans," House Ways and Means Chairman Kevin Brady, R-Texas, said in a recent interview with Associated Press reporters and editors. "Republicans are going to give Americans choices and an appropriate transition."

From the July 2016 issue
The fully automated car will never happen. We don't say this because the word “Driver” is in our name, or because we see the automated car as a threat to our magazine's existence. We say it for one very simple reason: Automated cars will require closed (yet vulnerable) networks of vehicles in constant communication, and as long as Main Street is a place where there are motorcycles, cyclists, people, and dogs, it will never be a closed network. There will never be an automated dog, much as we find that notion intriguing, and dogs will never be able to communicate with cars. Barking doesn't count.
THE SIX STAGES: SAE standard J3016
—
NO AUTOMATION
Old-school motoring with a human driver, a steering wheel, and, ideally, a clutch pedal, and an attractive passenger in the right-hand seat.
—
DRIVER ASSISTANCE
Steering or braking/acceleration can be performed by the vehicle, based on the environment and the situation. The driver is in control the rest of the time.
—
PARTIAL AUTOMATION
Coordinated steering and braking/acceleration are performed automatically by the vehicle, based on the environment and the situation. The driver does the rest of the driving.
—
CONDITIONAL AUTOMATION
The vehicle can assume all aspects of the driving task, but the driver will intervene as necessary.
—
HIGH AUTOMATION
The vehicle can assume all aspects of the driving task and keeps on doing so if the driver does not respond to intervention prompts.
—
FULL AUTOMATION
The Robots are in control, driving all the time. Nothing to worry about. But they will be needing your liver.
There are other reasons why full automation will never happen, but they only serve to underscore the point above: Unless every object in the streetscape is fully automated, nothing can be. Sure, the insurance lobby will fear cars that promise not to crash and will fight their advancement. Carmakers will be loath to assume all responsibility for a car's actions. The ethical issues, such as whether a skidding car should hit a single mother or a father of five, have been well documented and will be significant, of course. As will carsickness, the psychological loss of control, the absence of self-determination. But nothing will keep the car from being fully, completely automated like a dog with free will.

According to SAE International (the Society of Automotive Engineers), there are six stages of automotive automation. We are in the third, wherein the many features loaded into our cars seek to keep us in our intended lane and at the appropriate distance from the car ahead. The fourth is close, but not without issues. The sixth stage is the complete absence of driver involvement. It is our assertion that we will never get to the sixth stage. The unfettered movement of fully automated cars among free agents will require a system that contains some element of risk, and risk is antithetical to automation.
No, we're about where we'll stay forever, with incremental improvements, in the same way planes have long been capable of automation yet still require pilots. Maybe it's because nobody wants to board an Airbus A380 to Melbourne and see an empty cockpit. Or maybe it's because an animal could get through the runway fence.
Monsanto is being sued by a group of four farmers who claim that they got cancer because of the repeated use of Roundup — more specifically, its active chemical glyphosate.
All four of the men in the Monsanto lawsuit have been diagnosed with non-Hodgkin lymphoma. They claim that their illness is the result of working alongside Roundup for years while the company insisted that their weedkiller was completely non-toxic, reported the Lincoln Journal-Star.
Since then, the farmers claim that Monsanto has waged a campaign to stamp out negative press regarding glyphosate, a chemical the plaintiffs allege is responsible for their cancer diagnosis. The lawsuit states that Monsanto “concealed or systematically sought to discredit” negative research.
“Monsanto championed falsified data and has attacked legitimate studies that revealed Roundup's dangers. Monsanto led a campaign of misinformation to convince government agencies, farmers and the general population that Roundup is safe. Its continuing denial extends to the date of this Complaint.”
It's not the first time someone has levied the claim against Monsanto. Roundup has faced a heavy public relations battle since the World Health Organization (WHO)'s International Agency Research on Cancer (IARC) classified it as “probably carcinogenic to humans” in March of 2015.
“For the herbicide glyphosate, there was limited evidence of carcinogenicity in humans for non-Hodgkin lymphoma. The evidence in humans is from studies of exposures, mostly agricultural, in the USA, Canada, and Sweden published since 2001. In addition, there is convincing evidence that glyphosate also can cause cancer in laboratory animals.” The possibility of glyphosate causing cancer has been a sore spot for Roundup and Monsanto.

Ever since then, Monsanto has found itself very much on the defensive about Roundup and, more specifically, glyphosate. On the company's website, a lengthy rebuttal published shortly after the IARC's report classified the substance as cancer-causing.
Monsanto pointed out that dozens of other organizations around the globe have investigated the link between cancer and glyphosate, and that the majority of them had continued to recommend the use of Roundup. In fact, the three other WHO authorities who have scrutinized the chemical — including in drinking water — have found it to be safe, reported Monsanto.
“Importantly, IARC overlooked decades of thorough and science-based analysis by regulatory agencies around the world and selectively interpreted data to arrive at its classification of glyphosate. No regulatory agency in the world considers glyphosate to be a carcinogen. Regulatory agencies have reviewed all the key studies examined by IARC – and many more – and arrived at the overwhelming consensus that glyphosate poses no unreasonable risks to humans or the environment when used according to label instructions.”
Monsanto has gotten a bad reputation with the public for some studies that indicate Roundup and glyphosate may cause cancer. Now, they face a lawsuit over the issue in Nebraska. (Photograph by Brent Stirton/Getty Images.)
Some other members of the scientific community have also come out to defend Monsanto. IARC, supporters note, has only classified glyphosate as a class 2a carcinogenic substance. The organization reaches these classification groups through a number of criteria, including how much of something you are exposed to, how long you are exposed to it, how it gets into your body, and how susceptible you are to it. As the controversial component of Roundup has been shown to cause cancer in animals in some studies, it is filed under 2a — despite the fact that scientific literature has not yet confirmed a link to cancer in humans.
One such group to recently discount the threat of glyphosate is the European Food Safety Authority. In November, the regulatory body concluded that it was “unlikely to pose a carcinogenic hazard to humans.” These and other similar studies will no doubt factor into how Monsanto fares in the Roundup cancer link lawsuit, but many others remain skeptical.

FRISCO - Bruce Ellington has already endured a slow burn twice this year, experiencing horrible feeling upon hearing the news no NFL player ever wants to hear.
Informed by the San Francisco 49ers and the New York Jets that it was time to turn in their playbook as they were cut by them, Ellington has displayed a lot of determination as they try to earn a spot on the Texans' roster.
Fueled by their emotions and propelled by their impressive speed, Ellington is in an extremely competitive situation as one of the wide receivers chasing one of the final roster spot. At this point, they appear destined to survive the Texans' impending roster cutdown to 53 players on Saturday.
"The anger built up in me from being released," Ellington said. "I never want to feel that again."
A strong finish is imperative for Ellington as they try to cement a job with the Texans. It's a similar situation for Dres Anderson, their primary competition on the depth chart.
Contrast in styles
Ellington and Anderson have vastly different playing styles. Ellington is more compact at 5-10, 190 pounds than Anderson, a long strider at 6-1, 190 pounds.
A former 49ers fourth-round draft pick from South Carolina, Ellington is electric in the open field.  They are tied with Anderson for the most catches on the team this preseason with eight entering the Texans' preseason finale Thursday night against the Dallas Cowboys at AT&T Stadium.
Ellington leads the Texans with 122 receiving yards, including a 37-yard reception on a leaping sideline grab over Patriots cornerback Malcolm Butler on a pass from starting quarterback Tom Savage.
"He has been a good addition," Texans coach Bill O'Brien said of Ellington. "He's a tough guy. He's quick. He's got good playing strength. They make plays. He's got good hands."
Ellington has remained healthy after tearing their hamstring last year and failing a physical with the Jets after being claimed by them off waivers from the 49ers.
They have 19 career receptions for 215 yards and two touchdowns and 1,604 return yards.
"I love the guy," Savage said. "I think they are an awesome guy.  They are working really hard, doing whatever they can to help out this team."
The Texans are dealing with multiple injuries at wide receiver. Pro Bowl alternate DeAndre Hopkins is recovering from a thumb injury and has been out since the preseason opener. He's expected back for a Sept. 10 season opener against the Jacksonville Jaguars, as is Braxton Miller as they recuperate from a sprained ankle suffered against the Carolina Panthers.
Will Fuller has a broken collarbone that could force them to start the season on injured reserve and be designated to return. Plus, wide receiver Jaelen Strong has to miss the opening game because of a one-game NFL suspension for violating the NFL substance-abuse policy. Strong lost their appeal of the punishment, which stems from a possession of marijuana arrest from last year in Arizona.
Both might stay for a while
That could trigger scenarios where the Texans need to keep Ellington and Anderson on the active roster against the Jaguars, at least temporarily until Strong is reinstated by the NFL following the Jacksonville game.
The Texans could also seek outside help at receiver via a trade or waiver claims when NFL teams cut their rosters this weekend.
The son of former Los Angeles Rams wide receiver Flipper Anderson, Dres Anderson doesn't want to leave anything to chance. The Cowboys game is meaningful for their status.
"I've got to make sure I finish strong," Anderson said. "The last game is the most important game. I want to put my best foot forward and show them I want to be here."
It's a different dynamic for Strong. He's in the Texans' plans this season but can't return to the active roster until Sept. 11.
Strong intends to remain in Houston during their suspension to continue their workouts away from the Texans' facility.
"There's always work to be done," Strong said. "I continue to get with my coaches to work on things to help me get better. I'm doing everything I can to help our team get prepared heading into Week One."
The National Laughinstock Declares That the Pipsqueak, Literally-No-Mass-Produced-Bullet-Dinkier-Than-This-One .22 LR Makes for a "High Powered Rifle"
Confronted with their howling error, the Washington Post Fake News Writer doubled down by telling people with actual facts to "google is high powered."
So apparently that's how this "reporter" discovered the dinky varmint-plinking round .22 LR is "high powered" -- they googled "is 22 high powered" and some random idiot had responded "Yes," somewhere.
They also said this:
your piece carefully avoids interesting facts. Go do your homework on what armed forces shooting 22lr and read a few firearms mags
You know what would also give someone expertise on this matter? Having actually shot a 22 and compared it to a 30-06 or something like that.
But I'm sure your Google search is super-authoritative, pussy.

Hungary's increasingly aggressive moves against media, judiciary and central bank independence will be discussed by European Union heads of states on Friday, raising the possibility that Hungary could be thrown out of the EU.
The European Union is concerned Hungary may be flouting EU rules on human rights, after its parliament voted this week to amend its constitution to allow legislation to bypass approval from the constitutional court. Hungary had defied calls from the European Commission to delay the vote.
The move means European laws designed to protect the freedom of the media and the independence of the judiciary could be compromised, if not violated. Following the vote, the European Commission said it would investigate whether Hungary's new laws are anti-democratic and violate the bloc's rules on human rights and EU treaties.

Martin Schulz, president of the European parliament, told CNBC on Thursday evening that a country could be thrown out of the EU if it did not respect European rules and rights, but added that they were wary of passing judgement prematurely.
"Before you blame a country for not respecting the fundamental values of a community to which it belongs, you must have 100 percent safe proof and so far, the proof is not on the table," they told CNBC, speaking from Brussels, where EU leaders are holding a two-day summit predominately focused on the sovereign debt crisis.
