The Deadly HPV Vaccine
A Vaccine That You will want to avoid at all cost!
What is HPV?
HPV stands for human papiloma virus. HPV is NOT exclusively a sexually transmitted disease and HPV is NOT the sole cause of cervical cancer. Anyone can contract HPV, even if theyve been monogamous their entire lives.
Some people contract cervical cancer without HPV even being involved because HPV is not the only cause of cervical cancer, so the vaccine is not a true safeguard.
There have been no long-term clinical trials or tests done on this to show the effects of HPV vaccines on our sons and daughters 20 years down the line! Invasive cancers can take between 10 to 20 years or more to develop. Therefore, there can be absolutely no proof that the vaccine is postponing or preventing cancer until some 20 years or more after the vaccine introduction in 2007.
There are over a hundred forms of HPV. HPV 16 and HPV 18 are responsible for causing some 70% of cervical cancer. HPV 6 and HPV 11 help cause around 90% of genital warts. But - any genital wart may develop into a cancerous lesion. With that said, there is no reliable means of testing for HPV. Furthermore, the virus can linger for up to a year before symptoms appear, and up to two years after symptoms subside. MOST cases of HPV will clear up on their own.
Reported adverse reactions to HPV Vaccines
As of August 2013, S.A.N.E. Vax1 reports over 30,000 adverse reactions, 6,154 cases where the recipient did not recover, 975 cases of permanent disability and 139 deaths, all reported after an HPV vaccination. Some $6 million in damages to Gardasil victims has been awarded by the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program. Keep in mind that less than 10% of all adverse vaccine reactions are ever reported.2
An analysis by Wald & Shojan found that only 1.5% of all adverse events result in an incident report, and then a mere 6% of those adverse drug events are identified properly....The Psychiatric Times noted that the AMA is strongly opposed to mandatory reporting of medical errors 3
GMOs in the HPV Vaccine
S.A.N.E. Vax, Inc. tested random Gardasil vials from 13 different lots from all over the world and found that the genetically modified HPV DNA strands firmly attached to the vaccination's aluminum adjuvant in all samples tested. This aluminum binding allows the genetically modified recombinant HPV DNA (rDNA) to enter cells and wreak havoc. In one case, a 13-year-old girl developed acute juvenile rheumatoid arthritis within 24 hours of their third Gardasil vaccine.4 Two years later their blood still tested positive for this same rDNA. This unique rDNA have also been found in post-mortem samples of teens who died inexplicably in their sleep six months after receiving a Gardasil shot.
Aluminum Adjuvants in the HPV Vaccine
Aluminum is a known neurotoxin and can kill cells, cause neurological injury and lead to many other immune system problems. Every Gardasil shot contains 225 micrograms (mcg) of aluminum and the current recommendation is a series of 3 shots over several months. The complete series will result in 675 mcg of aluminum exposure.5
The American Academy of Pediatrics states in an article titled, Aluminum Toxicity in Children, Pediatrics (March 1996) "Aluminum is now being implicated as interfering with a variety of cellular and metabolic processes in the nervous system and in other tissues."6 They have completely ignored all of the toxicology studies on aluminum. Why, you may ask? Vaccines without adjuvants are useless and would be completely ineffective at causing any type of immune response. When the vaccine industry was put under pressure to remove the Thimerosal (mercury) used for 80 years in vaccines, they had to find another adjuvant and aluminum was the choice.
In studying adjuvants in vaccines, Rajesh Gupta reported, The the biggest issue with the use of adjuvants for human vaccines, particularly routine childhood vaccines, is the toxicity and adverse side-effects of most of the adjuvant formulations. Some of the side effects can be ascribed to an unintentional stimulation of different mechanisms of the immune system whereas others may reflect general adverse pharmacological reactions which are more- less expected.7
Dr. John Clements, World Health Organizer (WHO) acknowledges that the aluminum in vaccines is dangerous but their responses is Aluminum is not perceived, I believe, by the public as a dangerous metal. Therefore, we are in a much more comfortable wicket in terms of defending its presence in vaccines.
Polysorbate 80 in the HPV vaccine
(50 mcg): Polysorbate 80 in HPV vaccines is a known cause of ovarian deformities, degenerative follicles, hormonal changes, and womb and vaginal changes in rats.8 Polysorbate is an adjuvant that has shown to cause infertility in mice. When injected into rats it caused a rapid growth of reproductive organs, growth was abnormal and the rats were sterile, unable to reproduce. As stated in the Polysorbate 80 Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS), it may be carcinogenic (causing cancer), as well as a mutagenic (causing birth defects). When Polysorbate 80 was formerly used intravenously with vitamins, it was also known to cause anaphylactic shock.9
Sodium Borate in the HPV vaccine
(35 mcg): Sodium Borate was used it the past to disinfect wounds - until people started dying from repeated exposure. It was also used to clean infant nurseries in hospitals until too many babies started dying. It is used in roach killer and when humans are exposed to this chemical it causes vomiting, diarrhea, skin rash, blisters, collapse, coma, convulsions, drowsiness, fever, lethargy, low blood pressure, decreased urine output, sloughing of the skin, twitching of facial muscles, arms, hands, legs, and feet.10
HPV Vaccine Conclusion:
Studies by the Big Pharma company Merck, found that Gardasil had the same overall reaction as the placebo and the studies praised Gardasil for being as "safe as the placebo".11 But the placebo used was laced with the same deadly adjuvants as the shot. The placebo actually contained the same amount of aluminum as the shot, a metal that can cause the same types of nerve damage that has been linked to Gardasil. So, when any study says as compared to the placebo you cannot trust it! But you and your children will be stuck with the damage of these shenanigans so make an informed decision.

Some Valve employees are purposely dropping Half-Life 3 references to mess with people.
During a recent interview session at Valve's HQ, questions about Half-Life 3 were naturally brought up. According to the developer, though, not every Valve screenshot you see with the “3” logo is a reference to Half-Life 3.
Venture Beat brought up the most recent picture that sparked the discussion once again.
In the photo, as you can see, there's an Half-Life icon with the number 3 attached to it. The app is called “W3”, but that's about it. This obviously means Half-Life 3 is in development, at least that's what people like to think.
“It's news to us that the picture is out, but it's also news that this icon is on the screen,” Valve's Greg Coomer said, before shutting the whole thing down.
“Honestly, those icons have floated around this office for quite a while. None of us are going to be able to tell you what that is or why that's there.”
But what about that one GDC where Valve employees wore Half-Life 3 t-shirts? According to Gabe Newell, this was also a hoax.
“Some of the more childish members of our company have worn Half-Life 3 t-shirts to GDC,” said Newell.
Well, there you have it, Half-Life 3 is both alive and dead.
Supporters' behaviour dominating the headlines usually signifies a most unwelcome story. And it was no different this weekend, with bad news – two deaths and local elections that resembled a blocked Autobahn services toilet, bringing plenty of stinky, brown stuff to the fore – all around. But the considered way that fans, so often derided as unthinking lemmings, reacted to these personal and collective tragedies was truly remarkable.
What happened in Dortmund, Darmstadt and, to a lesser extent, Munich, put football in the shade. Down in Bavaria, the placards regularly held up in the Südkurve can be a bit hit and miss, like the former terrace legend Adolfo Valencia. On Saturday night, however, the Bavaria ultras proved astute political commentators unafraid to “put the finger in the wound”, as they say in Germany. They didn't choose the easy route of attacking the frighteningly successful right-wing parties or their voters but instead focused on the enablers at the top of the political tree, stoking the populist surge.

“Politicians use incendiary words, the mob throws the Molotov cocktails. Pathetic racists - we hate you ” read the first banner, followed by “The intellectual arsonists can be found in [the Bavarian] regional government, too: Seehofer and Herrmann!” The Bavarian prime minister Horst Seehofer, of the conservative CSU, has been one of the harshest critics of the chancellor Angela Merkel's refugee policy, their interior minister Joachim Herrmann has demanded a cap on the number of people let into Germany.
You can argue about cause and effect, of course, but not about the shocking extent of the xenophobic crime wave. In 2015, 76 refugee and asylum seeker homes were targeted in arson attacks. The crowds' intervention during the regulation 5-0 win over Werder Bremen showed just how far the most diehard Reds supporters have come since the mid-90s, when “Sieg Heil!” chants or the no less catchy “SS, SA, Bavaria!” could still be heard on the terraces. The game against Werder – the club led by the combative Social Democrat Willi Lemke, the arch enemy of Uli Hoeness – used to bring political differences into sharp contrast. FCB and CSU, the all-conquering, conservative Christian Social Union, still both rule with an absolute majority in the Bundesliga and the Bavarian parliament, respectively, but they are no longer interchangeable synonyms with overlapping personnel.
One of the perhaps most welcome effects of the club's hard-nosed drive toward internationalisation has been the marginalisation of local politicians on the board. They have been mostly edged out by businesspeople, certainly in terms of relative importance. The club have become a lot more politically neutral, while their organised supporters have firmly moved to the centre-left and now often make a stand against homophobia, anti-semitism and fascism of any ilk.

While the Bayern fans raised their voice, the 81,000 strong Dortmund crowds made the 2-0 win over Mainz on Sunday the most silent, eerily moving game imaginable. Two fans at the Westfalenstadion had suffered heart attacks during the first half. Medics were able to save a 55-year-old but another man, 80, died. News of the tragedy spread via social media during the break, and the Yellow Wall decided to stop all singing as a mark of respect in the second half. The Mainz fans joined in. At times, you could hear the proverbial pin drop in the huge ground, as sound levels reached Geisterspiel (a game behind closed doors) levels. “On the pitch, we didn't know what had happened,” said the Dortmund captain Mats Hummels. “Suddenly, the cheers stopped and it was really quiet in the ground. It wasn't easy to keep your concentration, you suddenly felt like being in a test game, with 30 or 40 people on the sidelines.” Worst of all, however, was the sense that “something bad happened,” added the 27-year-old.
Sevilla live in the moment to show La Liga there can be glory in every game | Sid Lowe Read more
The situation was similar to that in the Stade de France in November, Hummels thought, when Germany had played the hosts on the evening of the Paris attacks. At the end of the game, the Dortmund fans started singing “You'll never walk alone”, the club's unofficial hymn, in memory of the departed, holding up their flags. The BVB players listened with tears in their eyes. Süddeutsche Zeitung's Freddie Röckenhaus was reminded of “days in the past, when there were many accidents in the former city of steel and mining. The sons and daughters of the miners and steelers no longer face the dangers of heavy industry but a part of the special togetherness that exists in the cities of the Ruhr has steadfastly remained in Dortmund's stadium.”
“We were all touched,” said the Mainz manager Martin Schmidt, who said they had felt “strange” shouting out instructions in the silent night. “It was still a football game,” said the Swiss coach, but they and the players invariably “felt that they were doing something wrong” when the noise stopped. As it was, everyone did exactly the right thing, a feat that was all the more impressive when you consider the size of the crowd and the fact that it was pulled off organically, instinctively, without anyone following any orders.

The Darmstadt fans' tribute to the late Johnny Heimes before the 2-2 draw with Augsburg was, by contrast, very much pre-planned but no less touching for it. Heimes, 26, was a supporter of the Lilies and a talented tennis player who suffered from a malign brain tumour. Through their fight for survival and charitable activities – they collected money to help other cancer patients – they became a symbol of Darmstadt's unlikely rise from third division to top flight. Heimes died on Tuesday last week. “Without him, we wouldn't be talking about the Bundesliga here,” said the manager, Dirk Schuster. A huge banner with Heimes' face was held up at the Böllenfalltor before kick-off, there was minute's silence and the fans chanted their name instead of those of the players.
The Augsburg team and supporters, too, joined in the commemoration. It was a heartfelt public demonstration combining sorrow and optimism, the very thing that football does best. Everybody knows that the Bundesliga can be a hotbed of tribalism and aggression. But this weekend, the game proved that it can also be ahead of the curve with the spirit of solidarity and empathy for others which it generates. God knows an increasingly polarised and toxic Germany could certainly do with more of the same.

Economy, Labour • November 30, 2013 • Doug Nesbitt
The closure of the Leamington, Ontario Heinz factory by mid-2014 will result in 740 job losses in the industrial and agricultural region of southwestern Ontario between London and Windsor, Ontario. Over thirty tomato farms are losing contracts with Heinz which will also put 350 migrant worker jobs at risk.
The closure announcement comes only five months after Heinz was purchased by the Berkshire Hathaway hedge fund, which is behind the wave of factory closures. Warren Buffett, the world's fourth wealthiest person, is the CEO and largest shareholder of Berkshire Hathaway which took control of Heinz in June 2013. Buffett is the same billionaire who made headlines a few years ago by saying wealth inequality was a problem and that the rich should be taxed more. Clearly Buffett doesn't see their own investment activities as a driver of wealth inequality.
The plant closure has again exposed the inability of Ontario's mainstream politics to develop an economic strategy that actually benefits the province's working majority. Well-paying private sector jobs are vanishing amidst factory closures and deindustrialization in Canada's manufacturing heartland. Electro-Motive Diesel in London, the blast furnace at U.S. Steel in Hamilton, the Redpath sugar refinery in Niagara, Bick's in Dunnville, Chatham Navistar Assembly, and the St. Thomas Ford Assembly are just some of the victims in this trend.
The Impasse of Ontario's Mainstream Politics
Ontario Premier Kathleen Wynne claimed to have done “everything” they could, but won't disclose the details of their discussions with Heinz. Wynne has announced they will give $200,000 to help Leamington, even though the company pays $1.3-million in taxes to the city, county and school board each year.
Wynne's response effectively amounts to complete incompetence. Robert Crawford, president of UFCW Local 459, which represents the workers, said “Very disappointed. Nothing is changing. The plant is closing.” This is the recent Liberal record with plant closures in Ontario: do nothing.
After bailing out the auto industry in 2008-09 with a no-strings-attached $3.5-billion loan, the same Ontario Liberals fear any intervention to save jobs. They are now highly unpopular, marred by scandal, have lost significant public sector worker support over Bill 115, and are steering a minority government against two parties which are at parity in the opinion polls.
The Liberals (and NDP) also know the PCs will try to capitalize on yet another private sector bailout, especially of a union workplace. The PCs were also able to build up anti-union support by highlighting the CAW-Liberal alliance dating back to the Anybody-But-Harris “strategic vote” of 1999.
Hudak's Bogus “Right-to-Work” Solution
The Ontario Progressive Conservative solution to plant closures – and the province's wider economic problems – is outlined in their policy paper Paths to Prosperity: Flexible Labour Markets. At the heart of their plan is “right-to-work” legislation which, they believe, would make Ontario more attractive to business investment.
The document even gives the example of the 2012 closure of London's Electro-Motive Diesel (EMD) locomotive factory as a reason for right-to-work, saying that it will make Ontario “competitive.” But two of the other Heinz plants being closed are in the right-to-work states of South Carolina and Idaho. South Carolina has the second lowest unionization rate in the U.S.: 3.9 per cent. Idaho's is 7.1 per cent. By comparison, Ontario's is 28.2 per cent.
And after the Leamington closure announcement, Heinz announced it would invest $28-million in one of its Ohio factories. Ohio's labour movement built an alliance with the wider public to defeat similar right-to-work legislation in 2011.
What Hudak is promising with right-to-work is a lie. Paths to Prosperity even cites jurisdictions with higher union density rates, like Newfoundland, Quebec, and Saskatchewan, as leading destinations for new investment and competitive threats to Ontario's economy. There is simply no credible American study demonstrating that companies are attracted to right-to-work states. And while EMD jobs from London moved to right-to-work Indiana, it did so before right-to-work legislation was passed, and after the Indiana government offered
over $20-million in direct and indirect subsidies. Other factors, especially enormous government handouts and subsidies, are what convinces business to invest – not so-called right-to-work legislation.
Like the American Republicans who fight for right-to-work, the Ontario Tory cheerleading of right-to-work has nothing to do with economics, and everything to do with destroying union finances and labour's potential to effect change. Right-to-work makes union dues optional regardless of whether or not someone benefits from a union-bargained contract. Undermining unions is part of their well-known pro-business agenda founded on their “free market” fantasies.
What About NDP Solutions?
If the Liberals are doing nothing, and the Tories want to actually make the situation worse, what would the NDP do as the governing party? It is difficult to see an NDP government going beyond anything but offering Heinz a large chunk of money in some form of subsidy. While it is true that even the unpopular NDP government of Bob Rae bailed out the Orion bus factory in Mississauga (which the Ontario Liberals let close in 2012 with 330 jobs lost), the NDP shows no signs of proposing this.
There is definitely no indication that the NDP will dust off its old, founding CCF policies of nationalizing industry and bringing it under state/public/government ownership. In fact, with the dropping of “socialism” from its constitution, the NDP has entrenched itself in a policy of conceding to established pro-business economic policies.
Even if nationalization was a realistic option from the NDP (or any other party), any form of expropriation of multinational property would run up against powerful international trade deals, like the North American Free Trade Agreement, or the recently-signed CETA deal with the European Union. These free trade deals allow corporations to sue elected governments which pass legislation deemed by corporations to violate so-called free trade rights. Government intervention to protect jobs, the environment, and even local business interests have been successfully challenged by corporations as “unfair trade practices.”
And the costs of government expropriation of multinational corporations are very costly even if they're done without compensation. Take the case of the 2008 expropriation of Abitibi-Bowater's property, water and forestry rights in Grand Falls-Windsor, Newfoundland. When the company announced the end of its Windsor-Grand Falls operation with the loss of 750 jobs, Premier Danny Williams (who is no friend of organized labour), stated:
“That corporation has the right to do whatever it has to do to keep their company profitable … but from my perspective as premier, and on behalf of people of Newfoundland and Labrador, we're willing to tell them to go on and do their business in other parts of the country and other parts of the world…You came in with none of those resources, you leave with none of those resources, we wish you well.”
Under the Harper Tories, the federal Canadian government ended up paying Abitibi-Bowater $130-million for the expropriation to avoid an even costlier NAFTA legal case on the grounds that Williams' legislation passed in the House of Assembly was “illegal.”
No one can reasonably expect the public to be in favour of footing such bills for otherwise principled and morally justified expropriations. It is no wonder mainstream political parties won't take such actions. Any expropriation could also expect a predictably large and well-financed, well-propagated backlash from the Tories, much of the business class, and the media establishment. Those who can remember the grim Ontario NDP reign of 1990-95 may also recall the five-year propaganda campaign and ideological war waged by business groups against everything from rent controls, to anti-scab legislation, to pay equity for women.
A New Direction: Occupations, Cooperatives and Democracy
With no real choices offered by the three parties, Ontario's workers and unions need new solutions that can confront immediate plant closures, while beginning to tackle the bigger economically-rooted problems of growing wealth inequality and climate crisis.
Organized labour's current “strategies” against plant closure are going nowhere. As with Electro-Motive Diesel closure in London, union executives writing letters to federal cabinet ministers to request intervention or a review of foreign investment regulations has failed. Accepting concessions and two-tier contracts to “save jobs” is also failing, and not bringing jobs back in the numbers required. In fact, it's turning younger unionized workers against their own unions which continually sell them out. And telling people to get jobs in Alberta isn't going to help the climate crisis one bit. With Employment Insurance eligibility in Ontario at record lows (including below 30 per cent in mid-2012), our social safety net isn't working either.
The immediate solution to the Heinz plant closure is a democratic decision by workers to take over the plant and turn it into a cooperative under democratic self-management. This way the plant certainly won't be shut down by its owners. The plant is also in the perfect location for what it produces. It is surrounded by tomato fields, and is located beside the 401 Highway for easy, rapid shipment to most of Ontario's 12 million people, Quebec, and the populous American midwest and east coast. And it's not like tomato products are going out of fashion anytime soon. The fact of cooperative, local ownership that saved jobs is a selling point in itself.
Allied with the labour movement, the cooperative could work to secure business in conjunction with a coordinated Heinz boycott. Labour-led consumer boycotts need to be part of our strategy. When EMD workers were locked out and closure on the horizon, a number of labour and community activists picketed Caterpillar dealerships. Many local businesses and even Mark's Work Wearhouse and TSC pulled Cat products from their shelves. But the boycott's potential was never harnessed by labour, coordinated, and expanded. In the end, CAW's closure agreement at EMD actually forbade the union from pursuing a Caterpillar boycott. There is really nothing to lose in Leamington – except 740 jobs. [Support the Heinz factory employees on Facebook.]
Cooperative democratic ownership would also mean that the direct producers would not be polluting the very environment in which their families and neighbours live. This is critically important when we think about the climate crisis. As Naomi Klein said in
their speech at the founding Unifor Convention on September 1, 2013, labour can be at the forefront of tackling the climate crisis with a green economic strategy.
The Do-It-Ourselves Green Economy
We know tackling the climate crisis will require a transition to renewable energy of mainly wind and solar, a revolutionary expansion of urban and province-wide rail transit, and the retrofitting of every building for energy efficiency. The plant in Leamington would also contribute to a less polluting local solution to food production, instead of shipping in tomatos and tomato-based products from as far away as Mexico. Under democratic cooperative ownership, these decisions would be subject to democratic debate and decision-making where environmental and labour concerns and wider social responsibility would actually get a hearing (unlike in closed-door corporate board meetings).
Ontario ought to be at the forefront of such a transition because of its manufacturing base, but the plant closures are actually robbing Ontario, Canada and even North America of the critical industrial infrastructure required to make such a transition. Consider the closure of the Hamilton blast furnace and the loss of significant steelmaking capacities. EMD's closure and loss of 450 jobs in February 2012 left only two locomotive assembly plants in Canada. In April 2014, Caterpillar is closing Canada's only factory which builds the machines which bore subway tunnels. This means 330 job losses in Toronto – the same amount lost with the Orion bus factory closure, which supplied the huge Toronto transit system. Ontario is also seeing the decimation of a vast network of smaller autoparts plants with machine tools and the capability of various kinds of small-scale assembly. All these closed factories could be contributing to train, railway, windmill and solar panel construction, and retrofitting equipment and materials.
Plant occupations are nothing new. CAW occupied the Brampton Caterpillar plant in 1991 to secure a fair closure agreement. Ken Lewenza publicly threatened to occupy EMD in London if no closure agreement was secured. In 2004, workers in Arvida, Quebec went so far as to occupy and operate their aluminum plant under worker control to protest closure. The next step has been demonstrated in Argentina where workers took over abandoned factories and transformed them into democratic cooperatives, successfully defending the equipment and facilities from bailiffs and police through large pickets and protests, while simultaneously forcing governments to legally accept the transition to cooperatives.
What labour needs to do is occupy to save jobs, to develop cooperative, democratic ownership of the economy to curb the power of corporations, and to begin developing an economy that can actually address the climate crisis. Leamington could be a starting point, a beacon of hope for Ontario, Canada and the world. •

The Syrian regime has intensified efforts to reverse substantial manpower losses to its military with large-scale mobilizations of reservists as well as sweeping arrest campaigns and new regulations to stop desertions and draft-dodging.
The measures have been imposed in recent months because of soaring casualties among forces loyal to President Bashar al-Assad, as well as apparent increases in desertions and evasions of compulsory military service, analysts say. Some speculate that the moves also could be part of stepped-up military efforts to win more ground from rebels in anticipation of possible peace talks, which Russia has attempted to restart to end nearly four years of conflict.
But the regime's measures have added to already simmering anger among its support base over battlefield deaths during the conflict. The anger may be triggering a backlash that in turn could undermine Assad's war aims, Syrians and analysts say.
“These things have obviously angered core constituents, and they show just how desperate the regime is to come up with warm bodies to fill the ranks of the Syrian Arab Army,” said Andrew Tabler, a senior fellow and Syria expert at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy.
In October, the regime stepped up activations of reserve forces. Tens of thousands of reservists have been called up, and soldiers and militiamen have erected scores of checkpoints and increased raids on cafes and homes to apprehend those reservists who refuse to comply. Similar measures increasingly target those who avoid regular military service, a compulsory 18-month period for all men who are 18 and older.
In recent weeks, the regime also began upping threats to dismiss and fine state employees who fail to fulfill military obligations, according to Syrian news Web sites and activists. In addition, they say, new restrictions imposed this fall have made it all but impossible for men in their 20s to leave the country.
Since the start of the uprising in 2011, Syrian authorities have used arrests and intimidation to halt desertions, defections and evasion of military service — but not to the extent seen recently, Syrians and analysts say. Men who are dragooned into the army appear to be deserting in larger numbers, they say, and the government's crackdown is driving many of these men as well as more of the large number of draft-evaders to go into hiding or flee abroad.
“I can't go back. All these things would make it certain that I'd be forced into the military,” said Mustafa, 25, a Syrian from Damascus who fled to Lebanon in September because of the new measures. Citing safety concerns, they asked that only their first name be used.
Joseph, a 34-year-old Christian from Damascus, learned two weeks ago that their name was on a list of thousands of people who would soon be activated for reserve duty. Having completed their compulsory military service in 2009, they want to flee Syria.
“Of course I don't want to return to the military,” Joseph said by telephone from the capital. They also requested that only their first name be used.
A report issued this month by the Institute for the Study of War says the number of soldiers in the Syrian military has fallen by more than half since the start of the conflict, from roughly 325,000 to 150,000, because of casualties, defections and desertions. Combat fatalities alone have surpassed 44,000, according to the report, which used data from Syrian activists, monitoring groups and media reports.
Christopher Kozak, a Syria analyst at the institute who wrote the report, said in an e-mail that reservist mobilizations and efforts to stop desertions appear to be partly related to the departure in recent months of pro-regime militiamen. Scores of these largely Shiite fighters, who come from Iraq, Iran, Afghanistan and Lebanon's Hezbollah movement, left for Iraq in the summer summer to counter an offensive by the Islamic State, the extremist Sunni group.
Iranian fighters in particular have been crucial in helping the Syrian regime restructure its forces. One such effort was the founding of the National Defense Force, a militia composed of paid volunteers. The foreign fighters helped the Assad regime win back strategic territory from rebels.
Kozak wrote that these supplemental militias “are no longer sufficient to meet the regime's projected needs — spurring the regime to reinvigorate its conscription efforts” in the military.
Imad Salamey, a politics professor at the Lebanese American University, said that efforts to boost numbers in the military are partly driven by concern that Assad's allies, Iran and Russia, appear increasingly interested in a negotiated settlement to the Syrian civil war. In recent weeks, Russia, with Iranian backing, has engaged in diplomatic efforts to restart the Geneva peace talks that collapsed in February.
“There is rising urgency in these countries for a settlement to the conflict and the regime senses this, so it's trying to win as much ground as possible to strengthen its negotiating position,” they said.
Yezid Sayigh, a Syria expert and senior associate at the Carnegie Middle East Center in Beirut, said economic crises in Iran and Russia because of falling oil prices could affect their support for the Assad regime, which until now has prevented its collapse. “The question for me really is whether Iran and Russia are going to push the regime harder to engage in diplomatic efforts,” they said.
They added that a worsening problem for the regime is anger among its supporters over mounting casualties. Rare protests over the issue have been held by the minority Alawite population, which is the backbone of the Assad regime's forces.
Other minority groups, such as Syria's Druze community, also show signs of dissent. In their villages in southern Syria, most Druze families have refused to allow their sons to join the military. In an incident earlier this month, Druze villagers kidnapped regime intelligence officers in an attempt to free a man who was apprehended for refusing to serve in the military.
“The people are turning on the regime here because they don't want their children to die in this war. They don't see the point of this war,” said Qusay, 22, a resident of the mostly Druze city of Suwayda and engineering student at Damascus University. They also asked that only their first name be used.
“If the regime tries to push us to serve, there will be a fight.”

More than 30 employees of The BoatHouse Canton did not show up to work over the weekend after Immigration and Customs Enforcement began a review of the restaurant's immigration records, the restaurant's co-owner said.
The southeast Baltimore restaurant received a request from ICE to review its I-9 forms on Thursday, said Gene Singleton, who co-owns the BoatHouse. By Friday, many dishwashers, line cooks, food runners, barbacks and other back of the house staff told managers they were "very, very fearful" about coming back, they said.
"We encouraged people to stay but we understood if they felt uncomfortable," Singleton said. "They were fearful of just not knowing what was going to happen and being separated from their families. They said they were going to have to go home and take care of their families."
ICE spokesperson Matthew Bourke said the agency doesn't "confirm the existence of any ongoing investigation."
Singleton said their staff reviewed their policies and found no lapses in the paperwork they use to determine legal status.
"We have proper paperwork," they said. "We don't know whether they were all legal or partially legal or not legal."
Elizabeth Keyes, who directs the Immigrant Rights Clinic at the University of Baltimore, said it makes sense to assume that someone who didn't show up to work did so because they lack proper paperwork. But they aren't sure that's the case.
"If it was 2016, it would probably be folks who didn't have immigration paperwork, but in 2017, just the rumor of ICE coming somewhere would be enough to keep people from work," they said. "Some maybe didn't have papers, but I bet some did. I would expect even someone with a work permit to be too afraid to show up if they knew ICE would be scrutinizing the place where they work."
Singleton described the staff who left as "all really good people."
"We call them the heart of the house," they said. "They don't get enough recognition."
Singleton said the more than 90 staffers left had to keep pace with the regular weekend demand, including a 400-person event on Sunday. In a post on Instagram, the restaurant apologized to patrons who had a "less than great experience" and offered 50 percent off discounts to those who brought in receipts from Friday.
The restaurant also postponed a switch to a new summer menu. In a Facebook post, the restaurant said it would only be open for private events on Monday.
"We're going to work on our menus, take our time and bring in the right people," Singleton said.
Situations like this one are "incredibly disruptive to the fabric of our community and our economy," said Nick Katz, a legal manager with immigrant advocacy organization CASA de Maryland.
This is the first restaurant that has contacted CASA about this kind of incident, said spokesperson Maria Fernanda Durand.
CASA commended the way restaurant management responded.
"It's heartening to see support being extended to workers and their families," Katz said. "The message is that immigrants are a real positive force for the economy, and instead of trying to criminalize them, we should be talking about a path to citizenship."
Not everyone agrees. Over the weekend, the restaurant's Facebook page turned into a microcosm for the national immigration debate, with some commenting that they would no longer eat there.
Baltimore City Councilman Zeke Cohen also said this is the first time he's heard of ICE approaching a business in their district. They said the impact is "devastating" to the community.
"It's made a community that's already vulnerable go further underground," they said. "It's hurting commerce in our community and it's hurting families."

Image caption Chancellor Merkel has only just started work in a new coalition with the centre-left
German Chancellor Angela Merkel has fractured a bone in their pelvis in a cross-country skiing accident in Switzerland, their spokesperson says.
They will have to remain lying down as much as possible in the next three weeks and several visits will be cancelled, Steffen Seibert said.
They also suffered heavy bruising in the accident, in the alpine Engadine region of eastern Switzerland.
Ms Merkel was not skiing fast at the time, the spokesperson added.
They called the injury "severe bruising linked with a partial fracture on the left, rear part of the pelvis".
Immediately after the accident, during the Christmas holiday in December, Ms Merkel was not aware that part of their pelvis had been fractured, the spokesperson said. It was a visit to their doctor on Friday that revealed the exact injury.
They did not give details about how it happened. They were skiing near the resort of St Moritz.
Ms Merkel still intends to chair a cabinet meeting on Wednesday - the first gathering of all their coalition ministers.  They are now walking with the aid of crutches.
But mostly they will be working from home. They have cancelled a trip to Poland this week and will not receive Luxembourg's new prime minister Xavier Bettel in Berlin, the spokesperson said.
Ms Merkel's injury comes just days after fellow German Michael Schumacher's life-threatening skiing accident in France.
The Formula One motor racing star, who retired in 2012, is in a medically-induced coma and has had brain surgery after slamming their head on a rock while skiing off-piste at the French alpine resort of Meribel.
Their injury has sparked much debate about speed on the slopes and the risks some skiers take.
Fishing has been good this year, said Muhammad Illyas, letting their oar rest as the small wooden boat caught the tidal current of the Naaf estuary, drawing it gently towards Bangladesh. “I caught some great ilish here just the other day”. Light had begun to break and the far shore had receded enough to make it possible to imagine the soft grey cloud rising from the forests around the remote village of Nakphura was mist, not smoke from burning homes.

“The thing is,” the boatman went on, “I just can't eat fish anymore.” “Every day, you see bodies floating down the river, and I know what they've been feeding on.” Fisherman, small-time smuggler, and — though they won't discuss it — sometime trafficker of metamphetamine pills, Illyas is also an unlikely hero. For between Taka 2,000 and Taka 5,000 a ride (100 Bangladeshi Taka is Rs 78), men like them have made the dangerous journey across the Naaf in their small craft, risking arrest by border forces on either side to bring refugees to safety.
Illyas has a worm's eye view of what is emerging as a security nightmare for Bangladesh, India and the wider region: the emergence of an Islamist insurgency in Myanmar's jungles that could turn the country's Rakhine region into a magnet for the global jihadist movement. The only sound in the darkness was the squelch of Illyas's feet against sodden clay, as they dragged the boat on to the shore at a landing an hour's walk from Nakphura. The broker who had hired them had brought three women, two infants and an elderly man. There were some whispers, an exchange of cash, and the boat slid back into the Naaf again.
“The Myanmar border guards don't come near the shore at night”, Illyas said. “Perhaps they're scared or they're drunk, who knows?”. Salma, one of the women, said they hadn't eaten for three days, as they had trekked through the forest where they had hidden with their baby Hasina after the August 25 attacks by Harakah al-Yakin (aka Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army) jihadists on a bridge near Sikonchhori, 24 police posts and the 552nd Light Infantry Battalion's base.

“The soldiers came and started burning houses down, saying we had fed al-Yakin”, they say. “When people started fleeing, the soldiers opened fire. I saw my father-in-law and mother-in-law, who could not run fast, die”. Nur Hashim, Salma's husband, is fighting in the hills with al-Yakin, they say, pride in their voice. “The Burmese treated us worse than animals so we have no choice but to fight. All the young men in our village are fighting now, except the ones who are too weak”.
Azizullah, Sanjida's husband, went with al-Yakin, too: “They came to our village asking the young men to join them after the Myanmar army attacked it. They could stay and die, they thought, or they could fight and die”. Behind the sheer brutality of Myanmar's crackdown lies geopolitics. Faultlines of Geopolitics China has set up a gas and oil pipeline running from the Rakhine port of Sittwe to Kunming. Beijing has backed Myanmar's savage crackdown hoping it will bring security to a region important for China's energy security.
India, for its part, is working on the Kaladan transport project, linking Sittwe to Kolkata. New Delhi has also turned a blind eye to Myanmar's crackdown, fearing the country might otherwise again grant safe havens to North-East insurgents. Even Bangladesh was building a four-lane highway running from Chittagong to Sittwe. “Friendship road”, reads the signboard marking the path of the road — now covered over by refugees' ramshackle tents.
Yet, even though the flow of refugees from Rakhine, estimated at almost 500,000, has begun to still, there are signs the acquiescence might prove costly: in the dense mountain forests rising behind Nakphura, a powerful new Islamist insurgency is rising. Harakah al-Yakin's story began at Nayapara refugee camp, not far from the village of Phular Del, across the river from Nakhphura.
Also read | Why no country wants Rohingya, why it's so difficult to deport them
The camp is home to tens of thousands of refugees, most of whom have been living in desperate poverty since communal violence tore Rakhine apart in 2012. That year, following weeks of tensions, Rakhine Buddhists attacked Rohingya homes near Bohmu, in Mungdaw, setting off large-scale killings and counter-killings. Estimates suggest over 100,000 refugees streamed into Bangladesh — some in the face of fire from the country's border guards.
In October 2016, a group of men attacked an outpost of Bangladesh's Ansar auxiliary police inside Nayapara refugee camp, killed constable Mohammad Ali Hossain, and made off with 11 assault rifles and ammunition. The man who carried out that attack, Nurul Avsar, also known as Ruhullah, was a registered refugee at the camp, known to police as a gangster who provided muscle to human traffickers and metamphetamine smugglers operating from Shah Porir Dwip.
Police sources in Bangladesh say Ruhullah was recruited by Abdul Rehman, a cleric handling finances arriving from the large Rohingya diaspora in Saudi Arabia and Pakistan for the sprawling Imam Muslim Islamic Centre in Cox's Bazaar. The Islamic Centre's head, a soft-spoken cleric called Hafiz Salahul Islam, was once the first military chief of the organisation called the Rohingya Solidarity Organisation (RSO). Plans for a series of attacks on targets in Myanmar, Bangladesh Police said, were put together by a Pakistani national called Umar Farooq, who in turn was linked to jihadist groups operating out of Karachi.
Few took the threat seriously — until August 25, the day of the synchronized insurgent attacks. Abdullah Malik, now living in the grim, crowded desperation of Kutu Palong refugee camp, was one of the men who participated in those attacks. Shot through the leg while assaulting a police station, they received emergency treatment from the NGO Medicines Sans Frontiers, and then at Cox Bazaar's Digital Hospital. Shah was a school student in Budithaung when they were recruited by al-Yakin-seeking revenge, they say, for the Myanmar Army's treatment of their people.
“I lost two of my friends in the attack I was injured in”, they say, “but hundreds of youth are joining us now. The only problem we face is a shortage of weapons and ammunition, because Bangladesh is stopping us from getting what we need”. Few real details have emerged of the state of the warfare in Rakhine: however, satellite images of dozens of villages burned to the ground, and the continuing flow of refugees, bear witness to its savagery. “People I have transported tell me there isn't a single house still standing in Khacchar Bil and Boli Bazaar”, said Illyas. “There are still some houses in Nakphura, but I see new fires there every day, almost”.
Some refugees have sold their cows at Shah Porir Dwip's cattle market for as little as Taka 10,000 or 15,000 — a third to a half of the normal market price. “Their boatmen have been coming with their families, and sell their craft for to us only Taka 5,000”, says Illyas. “They need the money to get by, and they know the boat's going to be no use to them in the refugee camps”. Terror links to Pak, Afghanistan Founded in 1982, four years after a brutal military sweep against local jihadists sent tens of thousands of Rohingya fleeing to camps in Bangladesh, the RSO tapped al-Qaeda's networks in Afghanistan as well as seminaries in Pakistan to feed its armed wing, the Rohingya National Army (RNA).
After 9/11 United States troops found multiple videos of Myanmar jihadists under training at al-Qaeda camps in Afghanistan. In 1994, RNA jihadists crossed the Naaf to stage their only significant military operation, planting bombs that damaged a few buildings, and seriously injured four people. But the RSO soon degenerated, Bangladesh intelligence officials say, into a criminal organisation, providing protection to metamphetamine traffickers and smugglers. Though funds were raised for jihadist operations, they allege, most went into property acquisitions by the RSO leadership.
Following the 2012 violence, though, RSO leader Abdul Qudoos Burmi shared a platform with Lashkar-e-Taiba chief Hafiz Muhammad Saeed in 2012. Mohammad Ataullah, the Pakistan-born and Saudi Arabia-educated cleric who heads al-Yakin, was among dozens of new volunteers who joined its ranks. In 2013, Delhi Police interrogation of alleged RSO operative Khalid Mehmood, from the village of Yethwenkyawyng, threw up evidence that at least fifteen volunteers trained with Pakistan-based Rohingya in making ammonium nitrate-based explosives at Nakhphura.
Training also took place, intelligence officials know, across Myanmar's eastern border in Thailand. Harvinder Singh Mintoo, a Khalistan terrorist arrested by the Delhi Police in 2014, described training at a camp at Thailand's Mae Sot along with several Rohingyas, coached by instructors from Pakistan. Fearing Bangladesh government action, intelligence sources say, the RSO's leadership dragged its feet on actual operations. Ataullah revolted, and set up their own, new organisation with RSO's dispirited new recruits.
“He was very inspired by what had happened in Iraq and Syria”, says the Islamic Centre's Salahul Islam. “He believed that Myanmar's army could be defeated if the people rose and attacked it”. The weapons for the first strike were shipped across the river in small boats, and used to stage al-Yakin's first strike on Myanmar forces in October, 2016. “Everyone knew Rohingya were shipping weapons across the border”, says boatman Illyas. “Three months before the attack last year, we knew something was going to happen soon”.
Bangladesh intelligence sources estimate al-Yakin's weapons holdings have grown from the 11 it stole at Nayapara to over 400 now. Funds, one official said, are being routed from the Rohingya diaspora and jihadist groups across the world. “Look at any online jihadi propaganda feed”, they noted, “and you will see only one cause on it these days”. “I think the bodies will keep flowing in this river for some time”, says Illyas.

Why White Racist Humor Is No Joke for Black People
Former Attorney General Eric Holder suggested we are “a nation of cowards,” unwilling to speak accurately about racism. Numerous whites claim that lack of cultural competence and anxiety about being unjustly indicted as racist justifies their silence. However, when Black people exit their presence… many fragile, mute white folks mutate into vociferous, white face versions of funnyman Redd Foxx.
Journalist and historian Lerone Bennett, Jr. writes that President Abraham Lincoln “loved n-gger jokes” and “pre-Amos and Andy stories about the doings of ‘shuffling' Blacks.” Lincoln, dubbed “the great emancipator,” inferred that there was “something wrong with men who didn't like a good ‘darky' joke.”
Professor Kenneth O'Reilly documents that President Richard Nixon and Vice President Spiro Agnew shared a similar, pathological hankering for “darky” humor. The two orchestrated a minstrel show during a 1970 Gridiron Club dinner attended by a legion of elite white men who hooted and harmonized “Dixie.”
Perhaps that's why it's called The White House?
It's been argued that racists' power is waning and justice is allegedly on the horizon. Current events suggest this generation's racists are supremely skilled in concealing their devotion to harming Black people. The recent hemorrhage of toxic emails and text messages offers a gruesome, unadulterated glimpse of resilient racist pathology. This unvarnished speech obliterates Ta-Nehisi Coates' opinion that Whites “are often sincerely and greatly pained by racism.” They evidence a grotesque merriment with Black agony, a jovial commitment to global white terror.
Racist jokes are the luggage that transport and solidify values of white domination. Swedish sociologist and Nobel Prize winner Gunnar Myrdal concluded these jokes function as a “sounding board for and as a magnifier for” cherished rituals of mauling Black people. Texas A&M professor Joe Feagin confirms that anti-black humor permeates White culture. They co-authored Two-Faced Racism, which says, “Jokes allow [whites] to break social taboos, and thereby gain pleasure from expressing feelings and views that are normally repressed because of social pressures.” The book also suggests that racist humor “usually reveals hostile and deliberately hurtful sentiments,” invariably celebrating the molestation and denial of Black humanity.
Racism is ceaseless global war. Black people are to be mangled and subjugated by any means necessary. Everlasting literal and figurative denial of Black humanity is compulsory. Jennifer Eberhardt , 2014 MacArthur Foundation grant recipient, asserts that whites often associate apes with African-Americans unconsciously. South Carolina Republican activist Rusty DePass, former CEO of the Tennessee Hospitality Association Walt Baker, and former Ferguson court clerk Mary Ann Twitty all consciously, gleefully compared the Obama White House to Planet Of The Apes… in jest.
And they've all since apologized.
It is a gross miscalculation to reduce these behaviors to tacky tomfoolery from racially insensitive oafs who don't know any better. Military science dictates that enemy combatants be continuously maligned. White killer, “American Sniper” Chris Kyle emphasized, “you have to distance yourself from your enemy to kill him.” Centuries of n-gger jokes have placed light years between Black lives and white empathy.
Whether through the use of chokeholds or punchlines, Black life must be smothered and ridiculed. The demented White duo who mocked the strangulation of Eric Garner during a December 2014 WPIX news broadcast demonstrates that Black death is sidesplitting comedy for racists.
In fact, this noxious anti-black slapstick has contaminated our
own sense of humor. A sizable portion (if not the totality) of Black comedy is dedicated to Black deprecation. It's no mystery why racists appreciate – and recite – Chris Rock's gag about joining the Ku Klux Klan because of their hatred of “n-ggers.” Wendy Todd recognized this trend in the selection of South Africa's Trevor Noah to take the reigns of The Daily Show. Todd observed that White audiences devour Noah's routines that “often hinge on making fun of African-Americans.” Fear, miseducation and destruction of Black self-respect cause many of us to jeer ourselves for the entertainment of our oppressors.
Platoons of victimized Black people defended the character and racist hijinks of the Buffalo Bills' Richie Incognito. In 2013 they were banished from the Miami Dolphins for terrorizing their non-white teammates and coworkers. No small number of Black NFL players announced their support of Incognito—some even decreed them an “honorary Black man.” Unfortunately, the investigation into Incognito's activities revealed no honor. The investigation unearthed text messages where they and another white man snickered about battle rifles “perfect for shooting Black people.”
Deputy public defender Peter Santina admitted to not being “shocked at the revelation there is a white-power network within the [San Francisco] Police Department.” More than a dozen officers bonded while cackling about “burning crosses” and celebrating “Whitemas.” One suspected race soldier offered this recommendation if a Black person is invited to your residence: “Get your pocket gun. Keep it available in case the monkey returns to their roots. Its [sic] not against the law to put an animal down.”
The charred corpses of four Black girls murdered in the 1963 Birmingham church bombing illustrate that “putting down” Black children is white supremacy culture. “Put down” like Trayvon Martin. Or “put down” the way former Coatesville, Pa. school superintendent Richard Como texted about the Black children they were hired to educate. Coates and another white educator were tickled pink at the prospect of changing all of their Black pupils' surnames to n-gger. The former superintendent thought calling Black children “Joe n-gger, Bill n-gger, Snake n-gger got a nice ring to it.”
Serpents, baboons, n-ggers. Anything but a Black person worthy of life.
Even Black lives at the White House are unworthy. Tech conglomerate Google unwittingly corroborated the entirety of this report with their most recent apology to the White House. Millennial racists made “prank” submissions to Google Maps, so that one is directed to the White House when searching for “N-gger king,” or “n-gga house.”
This is Google's “most recent” apology because they offered a similar mea culpa in 2009. At the time, the top “Google Images” result for a search of “Michelle Obama” revealed “a picture of the American first lady altered to resemble a monkey.”
It's called the White House for a reason.

Government politicians are confident they can weather the storm of industrial action threatened by forecasters at the Bureau of Meteorology
Public servants at the bureau are planning to bring MPs and senators down to earth by denying weather forecasts to Canberra Airport at times when the politicians are descending on the national capital.
But Parliamentary Secretary for the Environment Bob Baldwin says denying weather forecasts to Canberra Airport would hurt the airlines, but not the intended target; the MPs, Senators, staffers and other political operators who surge in and out of the capital for parliamentary sitting weeks.
The bureau delivers much aviation forecast services to the airline industry which include Aerodrome Forecasts which are used by airlines to tell how much fuel they need for each flight, according to Mr Baldwin's office
Britain's museums need to face up to a reality. Cultural imperialism is dead. They cannot any longer coldly keep hold of artistic treasures that were acquired in dubious circumstances a long time ago.
Amal Clooney may or may not be the best ambassador for the Greek government in its long campaign to return the Parthenon marbles to Greece. The celebrity support this cause has attracted ever since Lord Byron made it part of their romantic image in the early 19th century keeps it in the limelight, but also allows the British Museum, where the best sculptures from the 5th century BC Parthenon continue to be kept, to portray its critics as self-publicists.
Yet this is not the only case of a cultural treasure whose true ownership is disputed. The Benin sculptures in the British Museum, taken from the splendid west African city by a British “punitive raid” in 1897, are never going to rest easy in Bloomsbury. Meanwhile the international mood is shifting and will inevitably continue to shift towards a consensus that many wonders of the world are wrongfully hogged by western museums.
In France, whose museums are just as treasure-laden as ours, the inviolability of the “national patrimony” is finally being questioned. We need to follow them down that modern road.
Britain has a particularly bad image when it comes to this, for two reasons: Lord Elgin, whose stripping of the Acropolis has been a stain on our international reputation since the early 19th century, and the fact that we were, before 1914, the most powerful of all imperial powers. Instead of seeking to live down these blemishes, we are hugely self-righteous about our possession of a vast haul of world art. We come across as uniquely determined to hold on to our booty and not prepared to meet critics halfway.
I realised this recently on the Greek island of Aegina. It has a superb classical temple whose sculptures were removed and taken to Bavaria at about the same time Britain took the frieze and pediment sculptures of the Parthenon. Today they are in Munich, but there is no global outcry for their return. Why not? Well, if you visit the temple you can't help noticing the prominent German involvement in archaeology and conservation work there. German scholarship has kept up a constant, reciprocal relationship with Aegina. There is no equivalent British involvement in the preservation of the Parthenon.
Why not? Instead of seeing Athens as its enemy, the British Museum should have got involved years ago in a very big way in maintaining and researching the Parthenon. It should have collaborated on the new Acropolis Museum (and offered to loan some of its astonishing sculptures). The whole issue could have been diffused by a more generous cooperative attitude.
The Acropolis Museum, a wonderful gallery, reveals why cultural colonialism is doomed. It is true the whole world flocks to the British Museum and the Louvre, and surely will continue to do so. But world-class museums are not confined by some act of god to northern Europe or north America. The Louvre Abu Dhabi has been criticised for the conditions inflicted on its workforce. But in the long term, it points to a world where great art collections will be widely and evenly spread. The feeble excuses for keeping stolen or seized art treasures in former imperial capitals are becoming ever more feeble.
In the end, the defence for hanging on to contested cultural goods boils down to the deeply offensive notion that Britain looks after the Parthenon marbles or Benin heads and plaques better than Greece or Nigeria ever could. How long can our museums keep up this arrogance? Not long.
The British empire is dead. So is the age of cultural booty.
PHOENIX -- A common refrain in the aftermath of Super Bowl LI was that if Atlanta Falcons head coach Dan Quinn had overruled the decision of offensive coordinator Kyle Shanahan to pass late in the fourth quarter, the New England Patriots' historic comeback probably would have fallen short.
Play conservatively for a 37- to 40-yard field goal, make it a two-score game, and the Patriots likely wouldn't have had enough time to pull off the comeback.
If only Quinn had stepped in as Shanahan called for a pass on second-and-11…
The stunning turn of events still is a hot topic eight weeks later, as evidenced by what unfolded Wednesday morning at the NFL's annual meeting, when it wasn't long before Quinn took their seat for the NFC coaches breakfast and was asked if they have second-guessed themselves for not doing so (he said they haven't).
Falcons coach Dan Quinn says that their disappointment in the sequence of events that caused Super Bowl LI to go the Patriots' way has nothing to do with the playcalling. Robert Seale/Reuters
It kept coming up at various points over the next hour, with Quinn showing impressive patience and thoughtfulness while reflecting on one of the most painful losses of their coaching career.
Quinn's decision to not overrule Shanahan -- the Falcons took a sack and then were called for holding to knock them out of field goal range -- has been hotly debated and analyzed. But there seems to be one significant part of the discussion that hasn't been flushed out, and it warrants further exploration.
Given the speed with which each play is required to be called and then executed on the field, how realistic is it for a head coach to overrule a coordinator on the spot?
And how often does it really happen?
As is the case with many things in professional football, there are shades of gray in the answers, but insight from nine of the NFL's 32 head coaches helps produce a snapshot of what they are often thinking in those moments.
“Things are moving fast. It's not like you have time to sit there and go, ‘OK, you want to call this play? I'm overruling that!' That's not how it works,” Baltimore Ravens head coach John Harbaugh said when asked in general terms how often they overrule a coordinator's call.
“It's not really realistic because when the play gets called, it sets in motion the operation -- the personnel is running on the field, the 40-second clock is running, or the 25-second clock is running [from when the ball is spotted ready for play] and you have to get the ball snapped. You'd probably have to call a timeout realistically to get it done, so that's something you want to plan ahead on as much as you can.”
In the critical fourth-quarter sequence in Super Bowl LI, Quinn had a little bit of time to plan ahead after receiver Julio Jones made a remarkable 27-yard catch along the right sideline to advance the ball to the New England 22. There was a slight delay as officials huddled to sort out an issue with the clock.
At that point, 4:40 remained in regulation and the Patriots still had all three of their timeouts. Quinn could have instructed Shanahan to take the air out of the ball, but the decision was made to stay aggressive. So Quinn didn't blink when Shanahan called two pass plays after running back Devonta Freeman was stopped for a 1-yard loss on first down.
“I heard all the plays going in. Like any other time of the year, if I had said, ‘Hey man, let's change that and go somewhere else', we would,” Quinn said. “There were times I did this year, so it's not like I haven't before. I'll always speak up when I think it's the right thing to do for our team.”
Understanding how that happens, however, adds important context to the discussion. Specifically, the idea that a head coach would interrupt an offensive coordinator as he's calling in a play is not especially realistic.
“I'm not going to interrupt a playcall,” Tennessee Titans head coach Mike Mularkey explained. “But I will say, ‘If we get the first, let's go to this play,' or ‘If we get to third-and-medium, this is what I want.'”
Added Cincinnati Bengals head coach Marvin Lewis, “You're not going to coach over guys all the time, but different times I may interject on something. It doesn't happen very often, I doubt that it's once a game.
“But it does happen occasionally where you're just going to instruct a coordinator, ‘I don't want to pressure here' or ‘Let's do this here and make sure we take care of this here,' because you're looking at the whole game management thing while they're just looking at what their particular side of the ball is.”
Patriots head coach Bill Belichick discussed this dynamic in a recent interview with SiriusXM College Sports, with Duke men's basketball coach Mike Krzyzewski playing the role of interviewer as the host of their show.
“When a coordinator gets into a flow during a series," Belichick said on the program, "I usually don't say too much at that point unless it's a timeout or I see a situation coming up like we're going to go for it on fourth down, so that could change the third-down call, or something like that. But for the most part, I let them call the game as the situations come up, so they can get into a rhythm.
“By the time the play is over and the ball is spotted, the coordinator doesn't have any more than 10 seconds at the most to get the play in because we still have to call it in the huddle and get to the line. Or defensively, we're on the other side.
“So I think the time when we talk a little more is in between series when our offense or defense is on the sideline. We talk about the next series coming up, and what we need to try to do, not just from an X's and O's standpoint, but sometimes as it plays into time and overall clock and game management. Same thing with special teams, but those situations can change in a hurry. So what you're talking about one minute can be a different conversation a minute and a half later.”

For Belichick and other head coaches, there is a balance to strike when working with coordinators.
“If you go in and try to micromanage things during the course of a game, I think you can find yourself in some bad spots. It's tough to call a game when you're constantly being second-guessed,” said second-year New York Giants head coach Ben McAdoo, the team's former offensive coordinator who still called offensive plays in 2016. “You need to empower your playcallers and assistant coaches and give them support.”
No matter the team or head coach, this link bound them all on the topic.
As Indianapolis Colts head coach Chuck Pagano said, “There is a fine line there. You have to let those guys work. You have to let them call the game. You can't be sitting there chirping the whole time on the headset because you can get them sideways.”
Pagano has lived on both sides of that head coach/coordinator dynamic, having served as Baltimore's defensive coordinator in 2011. Mularkey also falls into that category as a former offensive coordinator in Pittsburgh, Miami and Atlanta before taking the Titans' reins. Along with Belichick, Mularkey believes the best time to chime in is between series or during timeouts.
“That's when most of my input will come. I try not to talk too much because I know how that goes from being a previous playcaller; it's hard to get into a flow if you have somebody interrupting you all the time,” they relayed. “I try to be smart about it, but if I have a feel about a play, I will interject, and the coordinators know that.”
Typically, however, the head coach is focusing on macro issues more than a specific playcall.
“I know all the calls -- offense, defense and special teams -- so if I want to speed a game up or slow it down, I'm the one who comes in and tells the coordinators to do it,” Jacksonville Jaguars head coach Doug Marrone said. “What can happen is that you want them to stick with the plan, but maybe things aren't going as well and a coordinator might say, ‘Shoot, I have to make something happen.'
“I can kind of get a sense of that in the way they're communicating [on the headsets]. You can kind of feel that. That's when I might come on the line and say, ‘Hey, you're OK here, keep calling the game the way you are, don't worry about it.' Or it might go the other way and it's, ‘Hey, I think we have some issues, we have to try to make something happen, let's go after this guy.'”
In simpler terms, the Ravens' Harbaugh summed it up this way: “The goal as a head coach is to provide direction to the coordinators in terms of how we want to play those situations, and hopefully you practice your situations enough so everybody on the sideline knows exactly how you want to execute. It's not simple. It's complicated. But it has to be simple to operate under pressure.”
In Super Bowl LI, Quinn and Shanahan insist they were working off the same aggressive script in the fourth quarter after Jones' sensational sideline catch. Quinn said the sequence of events was “disappointing” but made it clear that their disappointment was not in "the call itself.”
The second-and-11 play in which quarterback Matt Ryan was sacked was intended to target Jones, and Quinn said, “Most plays where we had a play designed to our best player usually end up pretty good. … I totally trusted Kyle in terms of calls. There was an intent of where we were trying to go with the football.”
As Quinn spoke those words this week at the NFL's annual meeting in Arizona, Shanahan was a few tables away when they said, “There's nothing in that game that I would have done different. I know I did what I prepared for, what we prepared for, and we did what we thought was right at the time.”
Shanahan countered the widely held thought that running the ball was the obvious choice after Jones' catch, pointing out how the Patriots had shut down the run effectively throughout the second half.
“Just because you say you're supposed to run the ball, it doesn't guarantee that you're not going to lose yardage or something bad happens,” Shanahan said. They noted that the Falcons were called for holding on a rush that lost a yard late in the third quarter.
To the Colts' Pagano, the head coach/coordinator partnership “all goes back to trust” in situations like those.
“We all talk during the week and we're all part of the process when we put in these game plans. As a head coach, you kind of remove yourself and stay a step ahead, and try to manage the game,” they said.
“That's a major part of the role as a head coach. You have to be able to forecast and know when it's the right time to step in and say, ‘Hey, you might want to do this here, or this there' or ‘we're in four-down territory.' Those guys need to know that well before it's fourth down. It's staying one step ahead, a play ahead. When you're managing the game, managing the clock, there are a ton of things and it can be really, really difficult.

Apple's been running an iPhone trade-in program for some time now, which is different than the iPhone Upgrade Program that the company launched last year. With the former, customers can hand over their old iPhone (or any smartphone) to Apple and receive a gift card that they can spend on a newer iPhone. Currently, Apple doesn't allow you to trade in an iPhone with a cracked screen or significant damage elsewhere — like the camera. But according to 9to5Mac, that's not going to be the case for much longer.
Beginning this week, Apple will reportedly begin accepting iPhones with a broken display, camera, or buttons. The report notes that damage must be considered "within reason," so if your phone has been run over by a truck or tossed off a building or something, you'll probably still be out of luck. I can't even tell you if the phone in our picture above would qualify. Customers can expect trade-in values around $50 for an iPhone 5S, $200 for a 6, and $250 for a 6 Plus, per 9to5Mac. That could go up some depending on how much storage your phone has. For Apple, the hope is that adding more leniency to the trade-in program will encourage more customers to actually take advantage of it. Think about how many shattered iPhone screens you've seen, and yeah, it definitely makes sense.
Separately, Apple will also now permit Apple Store employees to install screen protectors on iPhones, a practice that was previously frowned upon. Apple doesn't really sell any great iPhone screen protectors though — I've tried this one and it's pretty flimsy — and it sounds like they'll only install products that you buy right there at the store. Still, if you're absolutely hopeless when it comes to applying these things, you've now got somewhere to turn; it'll just require spending some cash first.

When you conceal your will from others, that is Thick. When you impose your will on others, that is Black. – Li Zongwu
In the West, Machiavelli's book The Prince is probably the best known work on simulation and dissimulation. In Chinese culture however there is a rich and deep seam of literature on strategy and deception. Sun Zi's Art of War is the most famous, but the more recent book, Thick Black Theory (厚黑学 – Hòuhēixué), written by Li Zongwu (李宗吾) in 1912, is possibly the most important when it comes to trying to understand the Chinese strategies of today.
Li Zongwu was a social philosopher and critic and their purpose in writing Thick Black Theory was to describe the symptoms of an illness, or, to be more precise, to bring into the light the cultural shadow which is known to all in Chinese society as “thick face, black heart.”
The description “thick face, black heart” is used to describe what many, but by no means all, in Chinese society, whether they say so publicly or not, perceive to be the “must have” quality of Chinese people if they want to be successful, whether that be in society, business or politics.
“Thick face” is in essence a shield to protect a person from the criticism and negative opinions of others, thus preserving and thickening their own “face,” both in their own eyes and in the eyes of others, by refusing to accept the limitations or criticism that others have tried to impose or force upon them.
“Black heart” is the sword used to do battle with others as well as oneself. The black-hearted practitioner focuses their attention purely on their goals and ignores the possible cost to themselves or others. Together with this well-deﬁned and honed killer instinct, the cutting edge of a practitioner's sword is dispassion – to do battle without or, in spite of fear, and to be able to detach themselves completely from their own and others' emotions so that their presence does not thwart or hinder them from achieving their ultimate goals.
In Thick Black Theory, the methods by which people use the idea of “thick face, black heart” to obtain and hold on to money, status and power, and how they use these to preserve their position and accumulate more are described in detail.
Li Zongwu's original intention was to publish Thick Black Theory in a series of three articles in The Chengdu Daily in 1912. However, the official outrage and violent reaction caused after the ﬁrst article was published led to a cancellation of the series. This series of three articles was later published several times between 1934 and 1936 in a single volume in Beijing by friends of Li Zongwu. Despite the controversial image of Chinese society that it portrayed, each edition sold out immediately before being banned by the government – a deliciously ironic fact given that in 1989; when the ban on the book was lifted, it was published by the Central Party School in Beijing. The book is now a consistent bestseller throughout mainland China, has been published in multiple editions and has spawned a whole sub-genre of “self-help” books, as well as in-depth studies of historical events and characters following the “thick black” premise.
It is important to remember that Li Zongwu's work is purely an observation and study of “thick face, black heart,” and was never intended to be an endorsement of the amoral practices when mastered (which many non-practitioners would consider to be immoral) that the book describes. The irony that it is now used and reinterpreted as a manual for succeeding in business and society, only goes to show how prescient these observations were, both then and now, and how little has actually changed.
Australia's federal government has acknowledged today that it is growing increasingly concerned about what it describes as a disturbing influx of “plane people” into the country.
Australian immigration minister Scott Morrison said today that the latest figures provided to the Government show a disquieting number of foreign-sounding names gaining access to the country via aircraft.
Australia has faced numerous immigration and border issues in recent years, most notably from a once-thought-mythical race of boat people, whose arrival on the country's northern shores brought with it crime and the potential to take the jobs of as many as five Australians.
The Coalition Government, led by Prime Minister Tony Abbott, has taken a tough stance on boats, vowing to turn back any vessels that reach mainland Australia, and banning video games and films that threaten to expose children to boats at a young age.
Morrison warned today that while boat people had been tantamount to a “crisis” in the Northern Territories, they may pale in comparison to the potential impact of plane people.
“Boats arrive slowly, and our radar coverage is such that it tends to pick them up fairly early on in the piece,” explained Morrison. “Most of the time, we're able to intercept them before they get anywhere near our shores. Occasionally, they will reach us, but even then, they often smash themselves against the rocks, and while they might struggle for a bit, they usually end up all dying. So that sort of takes care of itself.
“Plane people, on the other hand, arrive swiftly, and in large numbers. There's often very little we can do about it.”
Morrison said that as many as 1,000 boat people had arrived in Australia this year, while people entering the country via planes numbered in the “lots more.”
Asked if they had the exact figures on hand, Morrison checked both their palms, and replied “No.”
“We can assure the public of Australia that, while they should panic, they should only panic a little bit,” they said. “The Government is working swiftly, and in concert with numerous agencies, to develop solutions to what we understand is a very new problem.
“In the interim, our concerns revolve primarily around the issues of crime and the protection of jobs for hard-working Australians.”
Morrison said that the threat of criminal activity from plane people was “extremely high,” with as many as 97% of convicted criminals having had a history of flying on aircraft.
They added that an influx of potential immigrants via plane threatened to reduce the pool of jobs available to the average Australian, saying that poor, malnourished and uneducated immigrants had an unfair employment advantage, due to their “superior skills and knowledge.”
Morrison said they would be meeting with the Prime Minister later this afternoon, and recommending that Australia take caution in the ongoing search for missing Malaysian jetliner MH370, as requests from a South East Asian country to find a plane “do seem awfully suspicious,” and may be a trap.
Ebola Outbreak Is A Global Health Emergency, WHO Says
Enlarge this image toggle caption Tommy Trenchard for NPR Tommy Trenchard for NPR
The Ebola outbreak in West Africa won't be stopped until front-line health workers get more support, World Health Organization Director-General Dr. Margaret Chan said Friday at a news conference in Geneva.
Cases Of Ebola During The Current Outbreak, By Country
After a unanimous vote by a committee of public health and risk management experts, the WHO decided to declare the outbreak an international public health emergency.
The outbreak is an international issue, Chan said. Stopping the outbreak — and limiting its spread — will require cooperation and coordination from countries around the world, not just those affected or nearby.
The declaration is a "a clear call for international solidarity," Chan said. But it "by no means implies that all countries, or that many countries, will see Ebola cases," they added.
So far, there have been more than 1,700 cases of Ebola and 900 deaths since the outbreak reached international attention in March.
Almost all cases have been in three nations: Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia. And the virus is moving faster than efforts to stop it in these countries, Chan said. The shortage of health care workers is one of the main reasons why.
"The three countries that are most affected by Ebola disease are countries that have very weak health system capacity," they said. They don't have enough doctors, nurses or even basic equipment, such as gloves and protective suits.
Ebola spreads through direct contact with bodily fluids, such as blood, saliva and vomit. So protective equipment is essential for stopping the virus' chain of transmission.
Fear and denial are also major obstacles to stopping the virus's spread, Chan said. Many people in the region still doubt that the virus is real. Others are too frightened to take sick relatives to clinics or report their deaths. Even some governments were initially in denial about the outbreak, Chan said.
"While Ebola is infectious," said the WHO's assistant director-general, Keiji Fukada, "it can be stopped."
The WHO is not recommending any travel or trade bans to any countries, despite the fact that a sick man spread Ebola to Nigeria a few weeks ago through air travel.
Patrick Sawyer, a Liberian-American business person, flew to Nigeria's capital, Lagos, and collapsed in the airport. Before they died at a Lagos hospital, Sawyer had spread the virus to several people. Now the country has recorded nine cases.
The risk of spreading Ebola through flights is minimal, Chan says. And shutting down travel to Sierra Leone, Guinea and Liberia would severely hurt their economies, they added.
The WHO is meeting next week to discuss the possible use of experimental drugs in the outbreak. There are no treatments approved for Ebola. But a few medicines are being developed.
Two American aid workers received one of these experimental drugs, called ZMapp, in Liberia last month after they fell ill. They are the only known people to be treated with the drug. And the decision to give it to them has sparked a fierce debate around why these treatments weren't tried earlier or with African patients.
"The problem is that these drugs are not approved for widespread use," Fukada said. "And they are available in only very small quantities," they added.
This raises a host of questions, they said, including who should get the drug and whether testing unproven therapies is ethical in these situations.
"In the past, the Ebola outbreaks have been relatively small and isolated," Fukada said. "It has not been enough to lead to the development of vaccines and medicines."
On, the first-ever Atheist Film Festival will be held at the Roxie Theater in San Francisco's Mission District from 12pm to midnight. Feature-length films will be shown in the 240-seat theater, short films in the small 46-seat screening room. The free festival is sponsored by San Francisco Atheists.Films shown will include: "Pledge of Allegiance Blues", a documentary that follows the Rev. Dr. Michael Newdow, the blues-singing California physician, as they battle to protect the separation between church and state; "Root of all Evil?" in which where professor Richard Dawkins examines how religious faith is gaining ground in the face of rational, scientific truth; "Evolution: The Musical" is a comical journey into the debate between creationism and the scientific model of evolution; "Submission" (by Theo van Gogh and Ayaan Hirsi Ali), "Audience of One," "Heathen Wind," and many others, including atheist youtube videos San Francisco Atheists is one of the most active Atheist-related organizations in the Bay Area. The group's website states: "Atheists do not believe in gods, devils, angels, ghosts, or other imaginary creatures. Atheists accept reality. We want to live natural, religion-free lives. We respect science and learning, knowing that only human thought, effort and courage will bring individual freedom and cultural progress."
Veteran British Comedian John Cleese has gone public with their support for Britain leaving the European Union, and has revealed a remarkable plan for the continental power bloc to improve its ailing fortunes in the absence of Britain.
Interacting with fans on Twitter after joking that their daughter's pet dog was looking forward to Donald Trump building the United States border wall, they more seriously turned their attention to the European Union.
And their ire was not reserved simply for bureaucracy and democracy, but for the mass migration currently plaguing Britain:
We were usually swimming against the tide ; and the EU bureaucracy took away any trace of democratic accountability https://t.co/pkGNYyqTCF — John Cleese (@JohnCleese) June 11, 2016
It should give up the Euro, introduce accountability,and hang Jean-Claude Juncker https://t.co/JtN3VwKPRi — John Cleese (@JohnCleese) June 11, 2016
And they hit out at EU threats to Britain:
I rather thought that plan had failed. I'll call Jean-Claude Juncker and ask if this was why they were threatening us https://t.co/HcKG14ndEs — John Cleese (@JohnCleese) June 11, 2016
There's been trading for millennia. I can't see that stopping.And don't we buy more from the EU than they do from us https://t.co/chzz7eu0aD — John Cleese (@JohnCleese) June 11, 2016
Perhaps surprisingly for a “luvvie”, Mr. Cleese bashed mass migration:
I would have thought that limiting immigration more effectively would reduce competition for work and protect jobs https://t.co/0KnkdMMofv — John Cleese (@JohnCleese) June 12, 2016
I think you're trying to convert me to my own position Noone's against immigration.We're haggling about the numbers https://t.co/VrHL70Imxm — John Cleese (@JohnCleese) June 12, 2016
Try to entertain the idea that immigration is a complex issue,where trading slogans brings very little illumination https://t.co/0wccLLKfkJ — John Cleese (@JohnCleese) June 12, 2016
And took the fight to the Remanians:
A 'Remain' supporter attributes my sordid selfishness to my being a baby-boomer.No,I was born in 1939 – a 'Phony War' baby,according to Eric — John Cleese (@JohnCleese) June 12, 2016
The only sad thing is that so many people seem to believe that anyone who disagrees with them must be doing so for bad motives. — John Cleese (@JohnCleese) June 12, 2016
Reflecting the views of potentially millions of formerly undecided British voters, Mr. Cleese tweeted: “If I thought there was a chance of major reform in the EU, I'd vote to stay in. But there isn't”.
If I thought there was any chance of major reform in the EU,I'd vote to stay in.But there isn't.Sad.Sorry,Paddy. — John Cleese (@JohnCleese) June 11, 2016
The tweet was inevitably followed by a torrent of support and abuse from Mr. Cleese's nearly five and a half million Twitter followers.
Answering some points tweeted at them about the European Union, veteran comedian Mr. Cleese told followers about Britain's lack of power to influence policy and legislation inside the European Union: “We were usually swimming against the tide ; and the EU bureaucracy took away any trace of democratic accountability”.
Mr. Cleese said the argument for leaving the European Union was about a lot more than just the money, which they called “the nub of the ‘Remain argument”, remarking that Britain had traded with the world for millennia without the EU. They also touched on mass migration, saying that while they aren't against migration itself but said it was worth “haggling over the numbers”, and that in their opinion “limiting immigration more effectively would reduce competition for work and protect jobs”.
As for what reforms the EU needed to survive, Mr. Cleese again mixed politics and humour, suggesting Europe do to with it's Luxembourgian president Jean-Claude Juncker as the Italians did with Mussolini, as well as ditching the Europe currency which has dragged Greece to its knees and now threatens to do the same to France, as well as opening the bloc up to real accountability.
It should give up the Euro, introduce accountability,and hang Jean-Claude Juncker https://t.co/JtN3VwKPRi — John Cleese (@JohnCleese) June 11, 2016
Mr. Cleese's expression of desire for Britain to leave the European Union is not by far their first foray into British politics. The comedian, who is perhaps best known for being a Monty Python co-founder but is also well regarded for their other comedy television shows and films is also a long-time supporter of the British Liberal Democrats, and their successor parties.
The Python's long-time political interest in government being opened to accountability and democratic processes may have influenced their decision to back Britain leaving the European Union.
It's nice that music-streaming service Spotify offers a free, ad-supported version, and most of the time we don't mind listening to an ad or two for the privilege. But those audio ads can be a serious buzzkill when they interrupt your party music. Here's how to automatically mute ads in Spotify and keep the flow in your playlists.
Windows
Blockify is far and away the best Spotify ad blocker for Windows. It sits in your system tray and mutes Spotify (or your computer, your choice) whenever it detects an audio ad. It'll unmute Spotify when the ad finishes playing.
Advertisement
Better yet, though, Blockify can do more than just mute ads: It also adds customizable hotkeys to Spotify, so you can skip tracks, play, pause, shuffle, and change the volume with keyboard shortcuts. It also allows you to play a substitute MP3 from your Music folder when it mutes an ad—that way, you don't have any empty space between songs. When it detects an ad, it will mute Spotify, play a random MP3 from your Music folder, and then move to the next track on your Spotify playlist when that song is over, which is a really cool little feature.
Mac OS X

On OS X, you can mute ads just by downloading and running Smutefy. Smutefy sits in your menu bar, mutes Spotify whenever an ad plays, and unmutes it when the ad is over. There's no other configuration necessary, though you will need previously mentioned Soundflower installed for it to work. It also has a manual blocklist, so if any do come up, you can block them from showing up again just by clicking an option in the menu bar.
Update: It looks like Smutefy has been abandoned, but you can still mute Spotify ads with SpotiFree, a simple AppleScript that works in a similar fashion.
Advertisement
Of course, it's also worth mentioning that the best way to avoid ads in Spotify is to pay for the $5 per month "Unlimited" upgrade. If you're going to block ads all the time, you're probably better off supporting the service, but we understand that sometimes you just want to make it through a playlist without being interrupted by out-of-place music. Use with care!
Boston Marathon bombing suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev won't be indicted within the 30-day period prescribed under the Federal Speedy Trial Act but prosecutors said Friday they would ask for more time.
Sunday marks 30 days since Tsarnaev was arrested following the April 15 twin bombing that killed three people and injured more than 260.
U.S. Attorney Carmen Ortiz's office did not specify the exception under which they would seek more time but those available to prosecutors include delays related to the defendant's physical capacity. Tsarnaev remains in a prison hospital after being badly wounded in a gun battle with police before their arrest.
Earlier Friday, a judge denied a request from Tsarnaev's attorneys that they be allowed to take periodic photos of the 19-year-old to document "his evolving mental and physical state" and whether their statements to authorities after their arrest were made voluntarily.
Tsarnaev's lawyers could be trying to argue that statements they made to authorities after their arrest on April 19 were not voluntary because of their poor physical condition. Defense attorney Miriam Conrad declined to comment.
The motion from Tsarnaev's lawyers remained sealed Friday. But the ruling by U.S. Magistrate Judge Marianne Bowler included excerpts from the defense filing which suggest Tsarnaev's lawyers may want to use the photos to argue for a lighter sentence.
Tsarnaev, 19, is charged with using a weapon of mass destruction in the April 15 bombings. They could face the death penalty if convicted.
Bowler said Tsarnaev's lawyers asked if they could regularly take their own photos of Tsarnaev.
"The defendant contends that their 'injuries over time' provide evidence of 'his evolving mental and physical state' which, in turn, is probative of 'the voluntariness of (his) statements and sentence mitigation argument,'" Bowler wrote.
Bowler found Tsarnaev's lawyers could not take their own photos, saying the Fort Devens prison where Tsarnaev is housed has a policy against visitors bringing cameras. The Bureau of Prisons could take photos of Tsarnaev with their lawyers present but those pictures would have to be shared with prosecutors, Bowler said.
The Trudeau government's promise of a “leaner, more agile” military has been given a head start as a DND report shows enlistment levels are the lowest they've been in years.
The report tabled in the House of Commons this week shows a shortage of nearly 1,900 regular force members and 5,300 part-time reservists as of March 2015, thanks to higher than expected attrition and, for reservists, “challenges in meeting recruiting quotas.”
That compares with a shortage of 900 full-time military personnel and 4,500 reservists the previous year. The military has said it needs more than 4,000 new recruits each year just to offset attrition and keep 68,000 full-time troops in uniform — the level the Harper government had vowed in 2009 to maintain.
The shortage of reservists was especially acute as the part-time force has been called upon numerous times to help with missions such as Afghanistan, or in crises at home.
Defence analyst David Perry of the Canadian Global Affairs Institute said the numbers in the report put the armed forces at their smallest size since at least 2009. But rather than rushing to the rescue, the Liberal government could end up shrinking the military even more.
The Conservatives were sensitive about reducing the size of the military after criticizing previous Liberal governments for doing that in the 1990s.
But the Tories' refusal to reduce the number of personnel in uniform at the same time it was cutting billions in defence spending put a disproportionate amount of budgetary pressure on other parts of the military, including maintenance and procurement.
One former defence chief, retired general Rick Hillier, warned in 2013 that reducing the size of the military was the only way to ensure the force remained strong and stable. They said the number of full-time members should be reduced to 50,000.
The Liberal government has promised to maintain current funding levels – which most analysts agree are unsustainable with the mandated staffing levels and planned procurement projects.
“Something has to give,” said Perry, who has estimated that cutting the size of the force by 1,000 regular-force members would save about $105 million a year.
National Defence also reported that it was short about 2,200 civilian employees, against an authorized strength of more than 24,000.

R&B singer Chris Brown appears in Los Angeles Superior Court on Monday, March 17, 2014. After a weekend in jail, Chris Brown has been ordered to remain in jail without bail for allegedly violating their probation stemming from their 2009 assault of then-girlfriend Rihanna hours before the Grammy Awards. (AP Photo/Lucy Nicholson, Pool)
Chris Brown has been taken into custody by U.S. marshals and will be transported to Washington, D.C., for an upcoming misdemeanor assault trial, an official said Thursday.
News4 has learned that Brown was removed from a Los Angeles cellblock on Tuesday by U.S. Marshals, and taken to the San Bernadino County jail, where he's awaiting transport to the District.
The singer had been in the L.A. jail since they were dismissed from a Malibu rehab facility March 17. They had been ordered to the facility after their probation was revoked in the wake of their D.C. arrest.
Brown and their bodyguard were accused of punching a 20-year-old Beltsville, Md., man in October. The singer's trial is expected to be begun in D.C. April 17, following pre-trial hearings.
Brown's attorney Mark Geragos had been trying to block Brown's transfer into marshals' custody, arguing it would deprive them of the opportunity to properly prepare for the trial.
The news that U.S. marshals had taken custody of Brown was revealed only after the cancellation of a hearing in Los Angeles that had been scheduled for Thursday. The hearing would have allowed a judge to hear a motion by Brown's defense attorney to block the custody transfer. However, that hearing was abruptly cancelled.
Geragos also wanted to bring their client to D.C. on a private flight, but it looks like that's not going to happen.
Brown's prosecutors have asked a judge to dismiss the case.
PROBATION IN RIHANNA CASE REVOKED AFTER D.C. ASSAULT ALLEGATIONS
The charge stems from an incident that took place around 4:30 a.m. last Oct. 27, when the singer was allegedly involved in a scuffle outside the W Hotel on 15th Street NW, near the White House.
The alleged victim said Brown hit them after they attempted to get into a photo with Brown. According to a police report, Brown told the man, "I'm not down with that gay [expletive]" and "I feel like boxing."
The victim received treatment for their injuries at a local hospital and was released. They told NBCWashington that they suffered a broken nose.
Brown and their bodyguard, 35-year-old Chris Hollosy, were initially charged with a felony because police said the severity of the charge was based in part on the extent of the victim's injuries -- but the charge was knocked down to a misdemeanor simple assault charge the following evening, after Brown and Hollosy spent much of two days in a D.C. jail.
When Brown first appeared in D.C. court, it led to a wild scene. The courtroom was so crowded that it was standing-room only. U.S. Marshals had to order spectators to leave and request that an overflow courtroom be opened.
When they left the courthouse, it was to shouts of "Free Chris." They waved to fans as they left.
Brown had been on probation since their conviction for attacking their then-girlfriend, Rihanna, in February 2009. Their probation was then revoked.
If convicted in the Washington case, Brown could face additional penalties, including time behind bars.
After their D.C. trial, Brown will be due back in L.A. for a probation violation hearing, where they could face additional penalties and time in jail, Good reported.

No one. At least that's my view. Certainly not American Catholics who use birth control, IVF, pre-implantation genetic diagnosis, and a wide range of other reproductive technologies previously and even more so now get a Holy finger wagging from Rome.
Moreover, I don't know any American Catholics who oppose the commonplace forms of human enhancement we use today and even the borderline ones such as taking brain-boosting drugs or drugs to help us sleep at night.
And this concept that the conservative movement more generally keeps leveraging–human dignity–the centerpiece of Catholic bioethics? Perhaps it could be useful, if anyone knew what it meant.
The only group, as was claimed in a Washington Post story on Friday, who may care about the Vatican's edicts are bioethicists who will, for a short period of time ponder the what, the why and the implication of Rome's declarations.
Bioethicists care about what Rome does, but I would argue not any more than we care what other nations rule in regard to reproductive technologies or other major religions decide on these very same issues.
So the Vatican has taken its stance like any other organization, religion or individual can. We will discuss it, debate it and wonder what difference it will make. But the Catholic church is fundamentally different from governments or other kinds of organizations.
The Catholic church is neither in touch with nor interested in developing recommendations for the 21st century to which its followers could or would adhere and it is not a government with police power, at best the Catholic church will do what it has just done. Take positions knowing full well that no real change will come of it.

Next year will see three of South Korea's most commercially successful and critically acclaimed directors present their English language debuts. Kim Jee Woon, Park Chan Wook, and Bong Joon Ho have already proved themselves in their homeland, and here at THN we are taking a look back over their past efforts. We continue to look at the films of Park Chan Wook, join us each week over the course of the next few months as we explore The Land Of The Morning Calm.
Director: Park Chan Wook
Year: 2006
Cast: Lim Su Jeong, Rain, Oh Dal Su, Choi Hie Jin, Kim Byeong Ok,
Plot: After an apparent suicide attempt, Cha Young Goon is sent to a psychiatric hospital. They also believe they are a cyborg and so doesn't feel the need to eat. A fellow patient sets about encouraging them to not starve to death.
After hitting, what seemed at the time, a career high that could never be beaten, it was time for Park Chan Wook to try something different. Their Vengeance Trilogy was receiving praise the world over, and they had made a name for themselves thanks to the dark themes, gruesome visuals, and thought provoking content. Something new was needed, something completely removed from their previous work. Enter I'M A CYBORG…BUT THAT'S OK, a bizarre fantastical romance that had more in common with the quirky worlds of Jean Pierre Jeunet and Marc Caro, than it did Park Chan Wook. However, this wasn't just a sudden change in approach triggered by some career crisis. I'M A CYBORG…BUT THAT'S OK came from a very touching place, and that was Park's decision to make a film more aimed at teenagers, of which their daughter was one.
I wanted to make a movie that my daughter and their friends could watch; one that dealt more with adolescent teenage concerns.
With that quote it's kind of easy to see where Park is coming from…kind of. The film has a very definite whimsical charm to it. It may take place in a mental institution, but each of the characters is crafted with a lovingness that makes it easy to relate or at least empathise with. The characters are infused more with slight quirks than what would be described as traditional mental illnesses. It is certainly an innocent fantasy that Park has sculpted this asylum into. Rather than delve deeply into specific illnesses, we have a series of patients who are almost like cartoons. There is the man who must always walk backwards and believes everything is their fault, a woman who suffers from mythomania and gives their own ‘interesting' accounts of everyone's backstories, just to name a couple. Their illnesses are often played for laughs but never in a cruel and mocking way. Seeing Shin Deok Chun (Oh) take the blame for everything or just contemplate that certain actions may have been their fault, is humorous in a bittersweet kind of way.
In terms of the main characters we have Cha Young Goon played by Lim Su Jeong, best known for their role in A TALE OF TWO SISTERS, and Park Il Sun played by Korean pop sensation, Rain, in their first major acting role. Both these young stars bring an innocence to their roles which is essential but challenging to pull off. Young Goon believes they are a cyborg and has been admitted due to an attempt to attach electrical wires to themselves via cutting their wrists. Seen as a suicide attempt; and because of a grandmother who believed they were a mouse, Young Goon looks to be recharged but believes food will cause them to malfunction. Il Sun is a kleptomaniac with a difference, they are able to steal people's souls and their traits. Il Sun feels an immediate connection with Young Goon and gives themselves the task of convincing Young Goon to eat. Their entire relationship brings into question how those in psychiatric care are treated. The doctors' solution to Young Goon's refusal to eat, is to give them shock therapy and force feed them On the other hand, Il Sun decides to play into their delusions, by “creating” a device that they then pretends to surgically place inside them They tell them this device will convert food into energy without harming them This works to a degree, but is it healthy to humour the mentally ill girl? Il Sun isn't completely oblivious to the dangers that their tactics may introduce, as we see in the final moments of the film.
Park is either brave or naive to tackle such issues with a bizarre and comedic tone. Many may argue that their handling of mental illness is much too simplistic and cutesy. For a film they were aiming at their teenage daughter, there is one scene which is particularly violent. Young Goon imagines themselves as a fully charged cyborg with guns for fingers and massacres the entire hospital staff. Was this a way of reminding us that Young Goon does possess dangerous thoughts, or perhaps a criticism of the treatment they have undergone only fuelling their potential for violence? It's a tricky one to analyse, but the whimsical tone helps to establish this within fairytale parameters.
The memorable visuals are aided by a simply unforgettable score. The melodies and rhythm are of that rare calibre, where you'll find them immediately engrained in your mind like tunes that have always been there. Composed by Jo Yeong Wook, who worked with park on JOINT SECURITY AREA, the score captures the playful darkness reminiscent of the works of Danny Elfman and Jerry Goldsmith's score for GREMLINS. Just listening to the opening chords of ‘Saiboguee Tansaeng' playing over the opening credits gives ideas of creeping around in dark and secluded areas, but in a cheeky and mischievous kind of way. Other highlights include the trumpet centred ‘Haipiendu' which has a nostalgic quality to it.
The film's narrative is as convoluted as the minds of the protagonists. There isn't so much a plot to speak of, but the story never seems stretched out as we are treated to gorgeous flights of fancy that include excellent work on behalf of the special effects teams and stunning production design, creating an environment which is most certainly odd, but in an intrigueing way. Some of the key memorable sequences include the massacre previously mentioned, where Park shows their affinity for shooting high action sequences in simplistic ways. Whereas OLDBOY had the hallway tracking shot, I'M A CYBORG…BUT THAT'S OK treats us to a single long shot of the hospital's garden as Young Goon walks around firing at the doctors and nurses. With squibs going off and people having to be in the correct place, you have to admire the choreography. Another wonderful scene sees Young Goon shrink to miniscule proportions and be carried away by a ladybird. These scenes are things you may expect to see in music videos of adverts, but are obviously well suited to their target audience.
The romantic element of the plot is very important here, and it's the first time Park has really strayed into such a genre. There's the romance in OLDBOY, but let's just say that's an entirely different beast. Il Sun's devotion to Young Goon is sweet and enthralling because they are intrigued by their quirkiness, but refuses to try and fix them “problems”. They buy into their fantasies to a certain degree and this allows them to explore their mind in a much more natural way. Had Il Sun tried to change them completely or believed unquestionably what Young Goon presented as the truth, then it would both weaken them as a character and taint the genuine love they feel for Young Goon.
I'M A CYBORG…BUT THAT'S OK is an inventive and fresh piece of work from a director who had already proved themselves as a great talent. It's uneven in construction and tone, but after exploring the darkness of vengeance for 4 years the man was obviously in desperate need for a change. The whole film could be split into mini-vignettes and each one would be filled with fantastic music and creative aesthetic flourishes. This may not be Park's best, it may be patchy, and it may be different…but that's OK. After all as Park comments on their daughter's opinion on the film:
…after they had watched it, they said that it was the next best film to PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN. SO there you go!
What To Take To STOKER? As this is a brighter and jollier turn for Park, I wouldn't expect much of the tone to follow into STOKER. The romantic element of STOKER, if any, seems more in line with the sinister observations of OLDBOY. Hopefully we'll get a powerful score, well composed shots, and characters that make an effort to understand one another as well as coming into conflict.
STOKER is released 1st March 2013. It stars Nicole Kidman, Mia Wasikowska, Dermot Mulroney, Matthew Goode, Lucas Till, Jacki Weaver, and Alden Ehrenreich.

Caracas homemaker Anny Valero scoured three state-run supermarkets one recent afternoon but failed to find meat, chicken, milk, rice or pasta. The final insult came when they tried to buy three cans of sardines and was ordered to put one back due to food rationing. Heading home nearly empty-handed, they grumbled: “This is a disaster.”A growing number of Venezuelans share their dismay. Amid food shortages, galloping crime and inflation that could top 150% this year, polls show swelling support for the country's political opposition which could win a majority in the Dec. 6 legislative elections.
Should that happen it would be a first major breakthrough for the opposition, which has lost nearly every local and national election since the late Hugo Chavez ushered in Venezuela's socialist revolution in 1999. It would break the power monopoly of the ruling Socialist Party, which controls the judiciary, the legislature and government watchdog agencies — all of which answer to President Nicolas Maduro. And it would open the door for a recall referendum to remove Maduro from power.
After nationwide street protests last year led to a government crackdown and zero reforms, “many Venezuelans are now looking for an electoral solution,” says Inti Rodriguez of Provea, a Caracas-based human rights group .
Venezuela's economic crisis is the product of falling prices for oil – the country's main export – socialist policies that have led to plummeting national production, and government corruption. The problems started under Chavez, who died of cancer in 2013, but have accelerated under Maduro, a former bus driver, labor organizer and foreign minister who lacks the charisma of their predecessor.

“No Socialist Party candidates want Maduro to visit their states because that would be the kiss of death,” says Jesus Torrealba, spokesperson for the opposition coalition known as the Democratic Unity Roundtable.
Under these conditions, an opposition victory in December might seem like a certainty. It's not.
During the 2010 legislative balloting, the opposition won more votes than pro-government candidates but not a majority of seats due to the design of the voting districts. As in that election, state workers are now being pressured to vote for ruling party candidates who also count on government financing and a propaganda boost via the many TV and radio stations controlled by the government.
Pollster Luis Vicente Leon said that over 16 years in power, first Chavez and now Maduro have mastered the electoral arts. “They fiercely control the institutions and the money which allow them to become stronger through electoral engineering even when their support is flagging,” Leon wrote in the Caracas daily El Universal.
Maduro has also proved a master of finding scapegoats for their country's woes.  They are now blaming the country's shortages on smugglers who take cheap Venezuelan food, gasoline and other items into Colombia and sell them for huge profits. In August, Maduro closed Venezuela's border with Colombia and declared a state of emergency along the frontier that also includes restrictions on political activities.
Colombian “mafias backed by paramilitaries are coming over and buying entire harvests,” Maduro said last week. “That's why the border must remain closed.”
But smuggling mafias have always existed along the border. These days, the incentive to smuggle is even higher due to Venezuela's artificially low prices and collapsing currency and there have been widespread accusations that both Colombian and Venezuelan police and military officials are deeply involved.
However, Maduro's argument – which is drilled into people's heads by state-run media – has convinced some some Venezuelans.
Colombians “take our gasoline, our medicine and food,” says Francy Bloisse, a retired Caracas lawyer. “I think Maduro did good work” by closing the border.
Another problem is that opposition leaders remain divided on strategy and out of touch with poor and working class voters who form the backbone support for Chavez and now Maduro. In other cases, its leaders have been sidelined by judicial fiat.
Last month, a judge sentenced Leopoldo Lopez, the opposition's most charismatic politician, to nearly 14 years in jail for their role in last year's protests in which 43 people were killed. The U.N. Working Group on Arbitrary Detention has called for the immediate release of Lopez, saying their trial was “conducted behind closed doors and marked by serious irregularities.” Several other leaders, including Caracas Mayor Antonio Ledezma, have been jailed or stripped of their political rights by kangaroo courts.
Even so opposition candidates are expected to win a majority of the 164 seats. Yet their power would be limited. Political analyst Carlos Romero says that before new deputies take the oath of office in January, the outgoing Maduro-controlled National Assembly could renew the extraordinary powers that have allowed the president to rule by decree since March. New laws that challenge government authority could be thrown out by judges loyal to Maduro.
Victory on Dec. 6, Romero says, “is important for the opposition in political terms but it's not going to change the course of the country.”
Meanwhile, average Venezuelans are spending more and more time searching for basic staples. Caracas labor activist Froilan Barrios claims Venezuelan employees now miss between 20% and 40% of their work hours because they must look for groceries.
For Valero, the homemaker, the task brutally interrupts their family's routine. During their recent grocery run, their auto-mechanic husband took the day off to care for their six-month-old boy as Valero stood in store lines. Their two daughters, aged, 7 and 9, skipped school and stayed home alone watching TV because Valero didn't think they would finish on time to pick them up after class.
All that for two cans of sardines.

A "chemical wringer" developed by researchers in Florida leaves clothes 20 percent drier than a normal wash, and could save consumers millions in electricity bills.
A novel mix of common detergent ingredients that lowers the surface tension in liquids could force extra water from clothes during the final spin cycle, the researchers found.
Dinesh Shah, director of the Center for Surface Science and Engineering at the University of Florida, and Ph.D. student Daniel Carter noticed that cloth fibers act like tiny capillaries, stubbornly holding onto water through the spin cycle. By lowering the surface tension – the force that keeps water in a straw when one end is closed with a finger – water drained more easily from these fiber capillaries.
The researchers found they could lower surface tension by mixing common surfactants in a new way – five parts lauryl sulfate to one part dioctyldecyldimethyl ammonium bromide. "We call it dodab," Carter said.
Carter tested the compound using a washing machine in their lab. They compared the weight of clothes after a standard wash against those washed with the new compound. The researchers will publish their results in the journal Langmuir.
Clothes dryers accounted for 5.8 percent of U.S. residential electricity in 2001, according to figures from the Energy Information Administration, costing $5.6 billion. "If you could cut that down by 10 percent, that would have a important impact on the big picture," said Jonathan Cogan, an EIA spokesperson.
Carter says they can do even better: "I believe that with further research, we could cut drying times by between 30 and 40 percent."
Carter said they believe the research will lead to a product, although they couldn't say when. The research was funded by a $200,000 grant from Procter & Gamble. The University of Florida applied for a patent on the compound and will license it to P&G.
"This would have a big impact on national residential usage," said the EIA's Cogan, "but I'm not sure how big an impact it would have on individual households. You would need to do a more detailed analysis, and it would depend on how much a product like this would cost."
They added that most American households use less-efficient top loaders, but front-loading machines that use less water and energy are becoming more popular, which could compound the energy savings.
Inside Russia's Troll Factory: Controlling debate and stifling dissent in internet forums and social media
Updated
Inside an anonymous building in St Petersburg, the Kremlin commands a workforce of hundreds that patrol the internet as trolls — assuming false identities online.
Their task is to control debate and stifle dissent in forums and on social media.
The department at the centre of this effort is officially known as the Internet Research Agency.
But its reputation has earned it another name by which it is widely known: the Troll Factory.
"Generally, they produce lies in a 24-hour regime, seven days a week," said Andrei Soshnikov, the investigative journalist who has led the efforts to expose the Troll Factory.
"In the morning, in the day, at night, something going on in world, or in Russia or St Petersburg, you will always find the comments from the Troll Factory."
News is sent to your computer with instructions about how it should be presented. Luda Savchuk
Soshnikov started monitoring the activities at the Internet Research Agency a few years ago, not long after they graduated from journalism school.
After their first reports were published, they hit the jackpot.
They were contacted by activist Luda Savchuk, who had been hired to work as a troll.
"I spent two months there," Ms Savchuk told 7.30.
"I saw that this is really a big factory to produce paid comments, posts, pictures, video, any content we face on the internet is produced there.
"There are four floors there, very many departments dealing with social networks, LiveJournal (the popular Russian online forum), YouTube, forums with the websites of different cities."
Working together, Ms Savchuk and Soshnikov published details of the Troll Factory's operations.
At least 300 employees are believed to work in the building.
Ms Savchuk managed to capture the only video ever filmed inside — a few shaky seconds of trolls at work.
"News is sent to your computer with instructions about how it should be presented," they said.
"It is not just objective information that is required, but in which tone it should be presented, to which conclusion one should drive a reader."
When opposition leader Boris Nemtsov was shot dead within sight of the Kremlin in March, suspicion immediately fell on those with links to Russian president Vladimir Putin.
Ms Savchuk said the orders at the Troll Factory were handed down quickly.
"They were just told: 'Nemtsov is killed. Everyone should urgently concentrate on this job. We shall write this and that'," they said.
"On that day they were writing that it was a provocation against the authorities, that they were killed by 'his own people'."
Kremlin moves focus to social networks
After smothering political dissent, the Kremlin is now targeting social networks.
They have been viewed as a threat since anti-Putin protests seemingly sprung up out of nowhere in late 2011.
The driving force behind the brief opposition surge was social media.
Journalist Andrei Soldatov writes about Russia's security agencies and their extensive online surveillance.
"You don't need any kind of organisations to do these things," they told 7.30.
"And that frightened the Kremlin in 2011.
"They still believe social networks [are] a major tool that might, if you have any kind of crisis, help people to send people in the thousands to the streets."
Right now, the priority topic for the Kremlin's trolls is Ukraine.
As the war in eastern Ukraine has dragged on, the Troll Factory has played a key role in the huge Russian propaganda campaign to demonise the Ukrainian government.
"In Ukraine, you don't have people, you don't have someone you can talk to," Soldatov said summing up the stereotypes reinforced by the Kremlin's trolls.
"You have only fascists.
"You have not just enemies, but someone who [is] completely unhuman."
Consequences for revealing secrecy behind trolls
The Troll Factory's actual address is 55 Savushkina Street, St Petersburg.
The building is surrounded by cameras, and employees do not appreciate being filmed.
7.30 tried to speak with someone from the Internet Research Agency, but the request was denied.
All of the companies listed in the directory in the building's foyer are fake.
I had serious concerns about my safety and I still have them now. Luda Savchuk
Soshnikov said none of them could be found on St Petersburg's corporate register.
The secrecy makes Ms Savchuk's revelations about the work going on here all the more exceptional.
"I think Luda is a hero," Soshnikov said.
"Here in Russia is big atmosphere, strange atmosphere, of fear, of lies. And not everyone will act as a normal citizen, or patriot, in this situation."
Ms Savchuk and others are prepared to fight back against the methodical re-establishment of the security state in Russia.
They accept the consequences that come with shining the light on Russia's trolls.
"I had serious concerns about my safety and I still have them now. Because the people who run this factory are quite serious," they said.
But they have no regrets.
"I did this with my eyes open."

Liverpool will hope to secure a fee of more than £4m when Jerome Sinclair's case goes to tribunal.
The 19-year-old striker has left Anfield to sign a four-year contract with Watford, it was confirmed earlier this week.
Sinclair's Reds deal expires next month, and has taken the decision to move on from the club which signed them from West Bromwich Albion as a 14-year-old, and for whom they have made five senior appearances.
They will become a Watford player officially on July 1, but Liverpool have had no contact from the Hornets since rejecting a £1.5m offer for the player back in January.
In the meantime, the Reds accepted a deal worth £4m plus add-ons from Bournemouth in April, only for Sinclair to show no interest in the move.
That fact is likely to form a significant part of the representations they will make to a Premier League tribunal, who will determine how much compensation Watford have to pay for the teenager.
Liverpool will receive just £250,000 for another youngster, Jordan Rossiter, who has signed for Rangers, but expect to recoup a lot more when it comes to Sinclair.
Watford, for their part, would argue that Sinclair has made only a handful of senior appearances, and that they are yet to be capped by England beyond U17 level.
Liverpool were last month ordered by a tribunal to pay Burnley £6.5m, rising to £8m, for Danny Ings following a process which lasted the best part of a season.
The Baltimore Ravens are currently facing a complicated situation at the tight end position for the 2013 offseason. All three of the Ravens tight ends, Dennis Pitta, Ed Dickson, and Dallas Clark, are slated for free agency.
The tight end position is becoming pivotal in this new era of offenses in the NFL. Tight ends give the offense more flexibility between the run and the pass, but as of late have become focused on the pass. Tight ends, which are becoming bigger and faster, are now matchup nightmares for defenses, as linebackers are often too slow to cover them and defensive backs cannot match their physicality.
The Ravens current situation:
Dennis Pitta
Dennis Pitta, one of Joe Flacco's good friends, was supposed to become a focal point of the Ravens offense this season after Anquan Boldin was traded away. After finishing 2012 with 669 receiving yards and 7 touchdowns, Pitta suffered a dislocated and fractured hip during training camp. They made a remarkable recovery, however, and played the final four games of the season, finishing with 20 receptions for 169 yards and a touchdown.
Even though their stats are not flashy, they represent the chemistry they have with Joe Flacco. Some have suggested franchising them to ensure the Ravens do not lose him, but that would start a debate of whether they are a tight end or a wide receiver. Additionally, Pitta will be 29 before the start of next season, which is very old for a player coming off of their rookie contract. Make no mistake- Pitta will be a focal point of GM Ozzie Newsome's interest this offseason.
Ed Dickson
The curious case of Ed Dickson… After notching 54 receptions for 528 yards and 5 touchdowns in 2011, Dickson has not come close to those numbers since. They lost their starting spot to Pitta in 2012 and could not step up without Pitta in 2013. Whether or not Dickson resigns with Baltimore will likely depend on how much money they want and who is willing to pay him.
The Ravens are not in a position to offer them a lucrative contract (nor would they want to). On a positive note, Dickson has improved at blocking with every year they have been in the league.
Dallas Clark
Dallas Clark is likely done in the NFL after a very long and successful career. A true pro, Clark was signed to fill in for Pitta after Pitta's injury and finished the season with 31 receptions for 343 yards and 3 touchdowns, outperforming Ed Dickson. Rumors are already swirling about their potential retirement.
Free Agents of Interest:
*Note- if you're looking a list of high profile free agents such as Jimmy Graham, stop reading. The Ravens do not target those types of free agents, so this list is comprised of mid-to-low-tier players who fit the Ravens' need and price range.
Scott Chandler, Buffalo Bills
Scott Chandler's greatest attribute is their natural size at 6'7" and 260 lbs that makes them a natural red zone target (he has caught 14 touchdowns in the last three seasons). The Ravens offense struggled greatly in the red zone this season, and Chandler could give Flacco another big target to pair with Marlon Brown. Due to their size, Chandler is also an effective blocker.
Brandon Myers, New York Giants
Myers is much more of a receiver than a blocker, as they caught 105 passes for 806 yards and 4 TDs the year before last with Carson Palmer and the Oakland Raiders. They struggled last year with the Giants, along with the rest of the team, but still managed 73 receptions, 522 yards, and 4 TDs. Many believe they are more effective as a number two tight end, potentially forming a nice duo with Dennis Pitta.
Fred Davis, Washington Redskins
Another low-risk-high-reward type guy, Fred Davis was franchise tagged not too long ago because they were that valuable to the Redskins. Throw in a couple injuries and being forgotten in RG3-land, and Davis is no longer a hot commodity. Only 28 years old, Davis is still young and still has plenty of talent.
RIM halted its stock this afternoon about 15 minutes after the markets closed as it released a "business update" giving a preview of its Q1 earnings, which will be announced in full on June 28th. RIM's move prevents anyone from buying or selling its stock in after-hours trading, and allows the market to digest the company's news today without making the share value go out of control.
As part of RIM's current financial turmoil the company has stopped providing quarterly earnings guidance, but today CEO Thorsten Heins said in a press release that the company will "likely have an operating loss" in its upcoming fiscal Q1. In Q4 the company posted a $125 million dollar loss on $4.2 billion in revenue, and it shipped 21 percent fewer smartphones than the quarter prior. Heins reiterated in the statement that the company "is going through a significant transformation" as the BlackBerry 10 launch nears — a message that very well may be referring to continued executive departures and rumored company-wide layoffs that would see at least 12 percent of its workforce axed. As part of the turmoil the company hired both a new COO and CMO earlier this month.
As for RIM's options for the future, Heins appears to be staying fast with their previous comments on the matter. In the release today the CEO said that the company is evaluating "the relative merits and feasibility of various financial strategies, including opportunities to leverage the BlackBerry platform through partnerships, licensing opportunities and strategic business model alternatives." The company also revealed today that soonafter Heins took the reins at RIM, the company brought on both JP Morgan and RBC to help RIM conduct a strategic review.
RIM's fiscal Q1 ends on June 2nd, and you know we'll be listening in on the company's earnings call on June 28th to see just how it fared. Meanwhile, we'll be keeping an eye on how investors take RIM's news once the stock is unfrozen.

One of the issues with traditional scouting methods versus mass data collection is the general tendency to report events with a level of specific interest to teams: tracking only individual players or focusing mainly on scoring chances or plays in specific locales of the ice. While this may suit the purposes of an individual scout or team, it definitely leaves a lot of information on the ice.
In an effort to capture the magnitude of information available and drive home the point that computerized tracking or scouting really is the next wave of data collection, I manually tracked literally every play on the ice of Game 1 of the CHL Canada Russia Series, a 7-3 WHL win, which resulted in 1,358 data points of information.
Specifically, I tracked: pass attempts, both successful and failed; all shot attempts, on net, missed or blocked and registered, scoring chances or not; dump-ins and dump-outs; controlled zone entries; loose-puck recoveries; puck battles won and takeaways. I also recorded whether an event happened in the offensive, neutral or defensive zones, and for all events that involved a source player and recipient I recorded the specific location of each.
Because I made no attempt to time stamp all the events I was tracking, I didn't normalize any of the results I observed for player ice time, but we can definitely infer some interesting information purely from raw event counts.
Brayden Point is really good
The Moose Jaw Warriors' and WHL leading scorer looks like a massive steal for the Tampa Bay Lightning, who picked them 79th overall in 2014. Despite their small frame (5-11, 165 lb.), the team captain and absolutely dominated a game featuring 11 players picked in the first or second rounds of the NHL Draft.
Point also carried two of the least effective skaters in the game on their wings in Colin Shirley and Deven Sideroff, both of the Kamloops Blazers. Shirley ranked 17th in total event participation while Sideroff was 27th. Despite that, Shirley came away as the game's leading scorer with a goal and four points (Point had 1-2-3). Much of the credit for Shirley's production should go to Point.
Ivan Provorov is the future of the Flyers blueline
The Brandon Wheat Kings star was easily the best Russian skater. This makes sense given their lofty draft status last year—seventh overall, the highest Russian and WHL player selected. Provorov ended the game ranked sixth overall in total event participation with 62, and tied for fourth in individual shot attempts with five. They also ranked second on the Russian squad in puck recoveries with 13. There is hope for your blueline, Flyers fans.
Memories of '72
There was an obvious disparity in style of play for the two sides. The WHL was content to dump pucks in and apply consistent forechecking pressure, bottling the Russians up for long stretches of play in the first half of the game.
The Russians were far more interested in making defensive-zone passes, probing for openings that would allow controlled entries into the offensive zone.
Russia was far more effective at gaining the offensive zone in control of the puck, but could not maintain possession once there. They struggled to string together passes in the OZ at even strength, and the superiority of the WHL side on the cycle was obvious.
The lesson
At the NHL level, a fairly detailed play-by-play log that tracks a variety of game events and ice times allows us to get a relatively good sense of what is happening on the ice without manually tracking every event. In junior, there really isn't a comparable amount of data, which is frustrating given that it would be useful for scouting purposes.
When it comes to shot-attempt differentials or percentages, NHL game sheets typically refer to about 100 events in any given game, or roughly seven percent of the information I obtained through this exercise. The time it takes to gather this much data manually is prohibitive. But it offers the ability to see very specifically how players perform in a variety of aspects and could help project skill sets at later points in their careers. That's extremely useful for both the analytic and scouting communities.
It will be interesting to see what happens as this level of detail is added to scouting in minor leagues in North America and Europe. In the right hands this type of information can be an extremely useful tool for roster construction and tactical planning.
The Battle of Murowana Oszmianka of May 13–May 14, 1944 was the largest clash between the Polish resistance movement organization Home Army (Armia Krajowa, AK) and the Lithuanian Territorial Defense Force (LTDF); a Lithuanian volunteer security force subordinated to Nazi Germany occupational administration. The battle took place in and near the village of Murowana Oszmianka in Generalbezirk Litauen Reichskommissariat Ostland. The outcome of the battle was that the 301st LTDF battalion was routed and the entire force was disbanded by the Germans soon afterwards.[3]
Prelude [ edit ]
In late April and early May 1944, the German authorities decided to transfer a significant part of the police duties in Lithuania to the newly created LTDF formation,[2] which was ordered to initiate a wide anti-partisan operation against the Polish and Soviet partisans in the area.[2][4] Three Lithuanian battalions were dispatched to man garrisons in and around the town of Oszmiany.[5] The AK commander for the Vilnius (Wilno) region Aleksander "Wilk" Krzyżanowski mobilized the region's partisan troops in response, but they were ordered not to engage the German allied LTDF in order to prevent the escalation of Polish-Lithuanian hostilities.[2] The Lithuanian troops, however, satisfied by their perceived superiority, started suppressing the local Polish communities suspected of harboring the anti-Nazi partisans;[2] numerous war crimes were committed by the LTDF,[6] notably atrocities against Polish civilians in Pawłów, Graużyszki and Sieńkowszczyzna.[3][7] Faced with the need to protect Polish civilians, the AK decided to fight back in early May, and organized a concentrated assault against the fortified Lithuanian positions around the village of Murowana Oszmianka. On May 10, AK units were ordered to prepare an assault against one of the larger LTDF units in the region.[2]
Plan [ edit ]
Major Czesław Dębicki "Jarema" was chosen to be the commander of the five AK brigades (the 3rd, 8th, 9th, 12th and 13th) that were to attack the LTDF positions in Murowana Oszmianka.[1] The AK reconnaissance perceived that their enemy's strength was four companies in Murowana Oszmianka (site of the local Lithuanian headquarters), two companies in Tołominowo, and a strong German garrison (with armored elements) in Oszmiany.[1] The strength and quality of the enemy's forces were ascertained to be superior by about 150 men, and created the need for a surprise attack, which was vital for the Polish plan and ultimate Polish victory.[1]
On May 12 a detailed plan was created. It called for:[1]
4 platoons of the 8th brigade to attack Murowana Oszmianka from the south-east, converging on the church;
The 3rd brigade would attack Murowana Oszmianka from the north-west;
The 13th brigade would secure the Murowana Oszmianka-Tołominowo road, possibly attack Tołominowo, and prevent cooperation between the enemy's forces;
The 9th brigade would secure the Murowana Oszmianka-Oszmiany road;
The Oszmiana-Murowana Oszmianka bridge would be blown up to prevent German armor from engaging in what became a significant Polish victory;
Communication lines between Wilno-Oszmiana would be cut off;
The 12th brigade and remaining cavalry platoon of the 8th brigade would be held in reserve;
A field hospital would be established in the village of Wasiowce;
Positions would be taken at dusk; all units would disengage by dawn to avoid a counterattack by the German Luftwaffe;
The assault would begin at 2300 hours.
The battle [ edit ]
On the night of May 13, the 3rd Brigade of the AK assaulted the village from the west and north-west, while the 8th and 12th Brigades attacked from the south and east. The remainder of the Polish forces (13th and 9th Brigades) secured the Murowana Oszmianka-Tołminowo road.[2] The defences, reinforced with concrete bunkers and trenches, were manned by elements of the 301st (1st and 2nd company)[2] of the LTDF. This detachment was already wavering following a defeat at Graużyszki on May 5, where they were dispersed by the 8th and 12th Brigades of the Home Army and suffered 47 casualties.[8] The assault was a success, partially because other Lithuanian garrisons in nearby towns did not move from their posts;[5] German reinforcements were stopped by sabotage of bridges and delaying actions (carried out primarily by the 9th Brigade).[2]
The 3rd company of the 301st battalion was also engaged in the vicinity of the nearby Tołominowo village by the 13th Brigade.[2] This engagement also ended with a decisive Polish victory.[2]
Aftermath [ edit ]
During the battles in Murowana Oszmianka and Tołminowo, the 301st battalion was practically wiped out;[2] only the 4th company managed to evade Polish forces and retreat.[2] The LTDF lost at least 50 men, with 60 more wounded and more than 300 taken prisoners of war (117 Lithuanians in Tołminowo).[2][9] After the battle, all Lithuanian prisoners of war were disarmed (the Polish resistance was able to capture one mortar and seven machine guns) and released with only their long johns and helmets on.[2][5][10][11][12] The Lithuanian officers were given letters from the Vilnius region AK commander, Aleksander "Wilk" Krzyżanowski, addressed to the LTDF commander, general Povilas Plechavičius, appealing for a stop to Lithuanian-Nazi German collaboration, an end to Lithuanian anti-Polish policies and a joint effort to combat the Germans; Lithuanians refused and demanded that the Poles either abandon the Vilnius Region (disputed between Poles and Lithuanians) or subordinate themselves to the Lithuanians in their struggle against the Soviets.[13]
After their defeat in the battle of Murowana Oszmianka and other skirmishes against the Home Army, the LTDF became so weakened that Povilas Plechavičius and their officers were judged to be useless by the Germans and were relieved of command. Soon afterwards, they were arrested and their unit dissolved.[2][3][14][15]

Introduction
Right now Deep Learning is taking over the world. Self-driving cars, composing music, replicating an art — what seemed like magic yesterday is nothing special today. And you don't have to be a wizard or math Ph.D to create such things. Do you have a graphic card? You're good.
One of the main reasons why Deep Learning is not a rocket science anymore are all those frameworks. Tensorflow, Caffe, Keras — you can build complex networks as if playing with LEGO pieces.
But not a fun part of it is data, people tend to forget about it. It's like a fuel for machine learning and without data algorithms mean nothing. There are lots of cool libraries for building neural networks, but not so many tools for data preparation.
Large businesses are able to collect large amounts of data and invest money in annotation on services like Amazon Mechanical Turk. But what small companies and researches can do?
Why did we build Supervise.ly
Here at Deep Systems we create AI solutions for various business sectors and face challenges everyday. To apply state-of-the-art models we first need to collect data, combine it with open-source datasets, annotate and prepare it for training. Usually it takes most of our time! 😫
To make things easier we had to come up with a solution. We wanted to create a place where you can go through every step of dataset preparation: from data to neural network model. And today we want to share our service called Supervisely with the world! 🎉
What's inside?
So how exactly Supervise.ly can help our fellow data scientists?

After a long hiatus, ratings are appearing again for recent episodes of Kamen Rider Gaim and Ressha Sentai ToQger.
TV ratings are important for showcasing how much of the audience is tuning into your program as it airs live. The ratings are also important for showcasing how often a competing program is beating, tied, or losing to your program in various key demographics. On the rare occasion that a program airs at night, its ratings will typically be lower than those that air in the mornings and daytime. Ratings for the GARO TV shows will rarely crawl above the 2% range due to the time it airs – typically between 1 AM and 3 AM.
In general, a TV rating can be summed up simply as ‘the percent of the total viewing audience at the moment‘ – 4% means 4% of everyone watching TV in a given location, usually Tokyo, is watching said program.
It's important to note that while The Tokusatsu Network strives to provide accurate and reliable information, ratings for shows not found within the top 10 for various categories are usually not released to the public. This means that the sources used by The Tokusatsu Network, while proving to be reliable in the past, are by no means guaranteed to be accurate and may change without prior notice.

The unrelenting whine of the Cessna 170 light airplane buzzing in my ear, I gaze down at the vast, stretching forests of northern Ontario struck by the sheer scale of the world's second largest country, Canada. But my daze is suddenly interrupted and my curiosity piqued. I spot a group of almost perfectly circular, light-coloured rings in the forest below that appear to range from a few hundred metres to over a kilometre in diameter. Noticing my interest, my pilot, JR, chips in: “Ah, you've spotted our forest rings! Pretty cool, eh?”
Ranging from 30 metres to over 2 kilometres in diameter, these mysterious rings that spatter Ontario's forests and farmland, are so subtle on the ground that people simply stroll right through them without noticing anything amiss. It was only with the advent of aerial photography in the region that these features were actually discovered. Their number is now thought to exceed 8,000. When investigated, it became clear that they represent rings of stunted tree growth. The exact cause of this phenomenon, however, remains controversial with a wide range of hypotheses; the more popular ones include the ideas that the rings lie above methane deposits, mineral deposits, and even diamond-bearing kimberlite pipes (named after the famous diamond-mining city of Kimberley in South Africa). Others favour a tree-killing fungus as responsible. Although now disregarded, one extreme hypothesis even suggested they were created by multiple meteorite impacts.
A team of Earth Scientists lead by Kéiko Hattori, of the University of Ottawa, and Stew Hamilton, of the Ontario Geological Survey, have shed light on the nature of the peculiar forest rings since beginning research into them in 1998.
They believe that the forest rings are caused by huge, naturally occurring electrochemical cells, i.e. big centres of negative charge (called reduced chimneys). These are known to geologists to often sit over mineral and methane deposits. As Elle Andra-Warner explains, it is best to “think of them as huge natural electrical batteries.” The negative charge from the ‘batteries' radiates outwards and where it meets positively charged oxygen in the soil the interaction of the opposite charges creates acidic conditions. This then eats away at the carbonate soil covering the region, resulting in a circular depression around the natural battery and stunted tree growth.
But what is producing these electrical fields and why in northern Ontario in particular?
Hamilton believes there is a clue in the age of the natural gas that is found within the rings. Its isotopic signature suggests that it is geologically very young and is likely “still being produced today” rather than representing ancient gas deposits. It appears that Ontario's glaciated landscape has a roll to play in the ongoing creation of this gas and thus the mysterious electrical fields themselves. Until about 10,000 years ago glaciers blanketed the entire region and as the ice retreated it left behind the youngest and most extensive glacial clay deposits in the world. The theory is that dead plankton and other organic matter left in the clay is now being consumed by large volumes of methane-producing bacteria.
This would explain why northern Ontario is home to the highest concentration of forest rings anywhere on Earth although they have also been reported in Quebec, the Yukon, and even as far afield as Russia and Australia.
Hamilton believes that 80-85 % of the rings in Ontario are a result of these methane plumes and that the rest can be attributed to other features such as kimberlites or the nickel, copper, and zinc deposits for which the region is known.
The case is by no means closed however; the exact origin of the huge electrical field within the rings remains a major sticking point. The team's hypothesis, according to Stew Hamilton, is that “millions of [methane-producing] micro-organisms are creating a massive, low-voltage electrical field that causes their food, the chemicals, to come forward to them. The bacteria don't have to move – the food keeps coming to them along the electrical field they have created.”
It's a fantastic idea but remains to be tested. This is not the last we've heard of Ontario's wonderful Os.

13 Reasons Why, the bleak new Netflix show about teen suicide, is dangerous. But school bans on discussion of the show are ill advised and not practical — forbidden fruit just becomes more attractive. Kids watching this program need dialogue to challenge its inadvertent message that suicide is a good option, and a way to get revenge on bullies.
Katherine Langford plays Hannah Baker in Netflix's 13 Reasons Why. ( Beth Dubber / Netflix )
As a psychiatrist who works with vulnerable teens, I'll be the first to acknowledge there are some good parts to the show. It brings very difficult topics out of the shadows and into the open: bullying, both in person and cyber; sexual assault, and teen suicide. The series is certainly stimulating conversation about these topics, which is great. My patients tell me the show makes them feel less alone and not as badly off as Hannah. It's also a wake-up call to parents, because most adults are portrayed as inept, even stupid. On the show, too many assume everything is OK, or blame serious depression and anxiety on “normal” teen moodiness. Too few bother to check in with their kids, or put in the time to build trust. The show's producers have defended its bleakness, saying they wanted to be very realistic. But I think they're naïve about how teens think — especially teens with underlying depression or other mental illness who are vulnerable to suicidal thoughts.
Article Continued Below
In the show, Hannah kills themselves and leaves behind 13 tapes, one addressed to each of the people who contributed to their anguish. It focuses on how badly everyone feels and how much they suffer as a result of their death, and realizing their part in it. But here's the problem: Suicide is very often an act of despair and hopelessness, not just anger and revenge. This show not only portrays suicide as a valid, logical option, but it shows suicide as a highly effective way to get even with people who've hurt you. Kids don't realize that, if they're dead, they won't be around to watch their tormenters suffer. Certainly, a lot of people experience high school in these dark terms, and there's a place for exploring that. But in 13 Reasons, the pain vastly outweighs the hope. It shows Hannah having no way out of their suffering. And this is simply not realistic — almost every teen has at least one adult in their lives they could turn to for help, or if not, there are resources like KidsHelpPhone.ca. There's been a lot of buzz about the graphic nature of the show — the rape scene, and especially the suicide, when Hannah slits their writs in a bathtub. Frankly, I don't think this scene is graphic enough. She's depicted as dead after just a few minutes. They have a smile on their face. In reality, if you cut your wrists, you would bleed to death slowly and painfully. You would not be at peace and calm. You don't look like you're at the spa. When we inadvertently give power, even glamour, to suicide, it's doubly dangerous because of the copycat effect, which is very real in suicide. Already, I'm starting to hear anecdotal reports about a higher volume of teens taken to Toronto hospital emergency departments than usual this spring. Recently, a colleague at a Toronto hospital told me six young people taken to the ER for suicidal behaviour on a recent weekend specifically cited 13 Reasons as part of their motivation.
Although I wish the show were much different, I do think it's very difficult to stop kids from watching it. For that reason, it's essential that schools take leadership and open discussions of it. I'm not seeing schools make any effort to do anything other than warn parents about its dangers. The story is such a morality tale — I think it would be good for English classes to compare it to Lord of the Flies, because both show that bad things happen when adults aren't around. The first thing parents and educators need to understand is that many teens, unfortunately, do experience bullying and sexual assault but very few kill themselves. That's because in 80 to 90 per cent of teen suicides, there's a pre-existing mental illness — usually untreated depression. And when you're in the midst of a depression, you often can't see a way out. It's essential to identify those kids. I ask suicidal teens if we could remove your pain, or make it tolerable, would you still want to die? They always say no.
Article Continued Below
Parents need to create an environment in the home where it's safe to talk about tough things. If your teen confides in you, listen without judgment. Empathize (i.e. “that must have been very hard for you”). If your child is watching the show, try to watch it with them or them Ask questions like: “What do you take from the show? How did it make you feel? Do you think it's realistic? Have you ever felt this way? Have you ever been bullied? Please don't ever hesitate to tell me about it.” For Hannah, I would have suggested they switch schools and get treatment for their depression. But every kid is different. Consider your own teen's temperament and what solutions might work best for them. Sometimes it's good to bring the school in. But if they're terrified of that option, talk to them about options that don't involve contacting the school. Demonstrate you care about them, and promise to do your best. With a show like 13 Reasons out there, now is the time to check in with your kids, look for signs of depression and open dialogue about their emotional health. Depression and trauma are highly treatable, but only if you ask for help.

The silhouette tease of an arc-winged warrior of Aiur was only a brief taste of what's in store for Protoss players in the first Starcraft 2 expansion: Heart of the Swarm. After a quick playthrough, here's a brief rundown of the new Protoss units and abilities in the Heart of the Swarm multiplayer demo.
Nexus Abilities
In Heart of the Swarm, the Nexus has a pair of new abilities that will help Protoss players on the defensive.
Arc Shield
Cost: 25 Energy
Effect: Place an anti-light cannon on top of any structure for a brief period of time.
This will be a nice defensive ability for Protoss players protecting an early expansion, and later on in the game for protecting outlying expansions against small raids. It seems like there could be potential to use this ability to protect proxy Pylons during an early attack as well.
Recall
Cost: 75 Energy
Effect: Transports selected units to target Nexus
The Mothership is gone, and the Recall ability has been moved to the Nexus. Because of the high energy cost, it seems that this is an ability we'll only see in the later stages of the game, and as a defensive/retreat measure.
New Units
There are three new units added to the Protoss arsenal in Heart of the Swarm, while the Carrier and Mothership have been removed. There are two new units that come from the Stargate, and a new unit from the Robotics Facility.
Replicant
Built from: Robotics Facility
Cost: 200/200
The Replicant is a really interesting unit. It builds quickly, has very low hitpoints, and has no base attack. The core function of this unit is that it has the ability to transform itself into any non-massive unit. It seems like it will help Protoss players be more flexible in the early game, being able to replicate a Sentry for a few more Forcefields or an Immortal for some extra stopping power early. I can see alot of potential for speeding up tech switches as well in the later stages of the game, by banking up a few Replicants and transforming them into a shiny new Stargate army. We'll have to see.
Oracle
Built From: Stargate
Cost: 150/200
The Oracle was the most interesting addition to the Protoss arsenal. It is a spellcaster with no base attack, moves quickly, and has three different, very unique spells.
Phase Shift – Target structure is phased out of existence for a brief period of time. During this time, it can't be attacked, use abilities, provide power or tech. Massive structures (Command Centers, Hatcheries, Nexus, etc.) are immune. This ability seems like it will be very flexible, with offensive and defensive capabilities. Phasing out important buildings of your own during an attack could prevent having to rebuild a tech tree, and powering down important tech buildings of your opponent can slow down certain timings and upgrades.
Preordain – Placed on a target enemy structure to gain vision of what it is producing. This will be a useful scouting tool, gaining intel on what upgrades and units your opponent is getting. I feel like this will be very nice against Zerg to see what Hatchery upgrades (Burrow, Overlord Upgrades) they are getting, as well as the upgrades from their tech structures, and seeing what is coming out of Terran Techlabs at specific times.
Entomb – Prevents mining from target Mineral patch for 45 seconds. Can also be used to remove Entomb from patches of your own. This is a nice harrassment ability that can do a ton of economic damage, especially if you get a few Oracles flying all around the map.
Tempest
Built From: Stargate
Cost: 300/300
Although it pains me to see the Carrier go, I have a feeling that the Tempest is going to fit into the Protoss arsenal very nicely. One nice upgrade from the Carrier is the movement speed is a little quicker on the Tempest. It's AtA attack does AoE damage, which will be good for dealing with masses of Mutalisks, and help soften up flocks of Vikings and Corrupters that are aiming to take down Collosi. Its AtG attack is slow, but does a pretty good amount of damage, so it will be best to target down high-hitpoint targets. I feel like the AtA attack will be the most important part of the Tempest for the most part.
After only 30 minutes of play, it's hard to say exactly how the units will carry over into competitive play, but there is definitely alot of potential. Stay tuned for a rundown of the new units and abilities of Terran and Zerg!
You should keep in mind that none of these changes are final. What we have here at BlizzCon is a work in progress.
Signup to receive a daily roundup of the top LGBT+ news stories from around the world
The Mormon Church has made a surprising donation to a Salt Lake City LGBT group – despite its strong opposition to equality.
The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints just might be welcoming progress, starting with donating for the first time ever to the Utah Pride Center.
Based in Salt Lake City, the non-profit centre focuses on assisting the young and homeless LGBT community.
Utah Pride Center board president Kent Frogley said: “The Utah Pride Center is grateful for the church's help in our efforts to provide food for those in our community who are in need.
“We are grateful for their generosity and the emerging relationship with The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.
“We know that this contribution marks a significant moment in the LDS/LGBTQ relationship.”
Fox 13 Salt Lake City reported that the donation amounts to $2,500 and grants access to the Bishop's Storehouse.
A tool of welfare services, Victor L. Brown describes the purpose of the storehouse on the Church's official website: “A physical bishops storehouse is a sacred facility in which are deposited consecrated commodities provided by those who have, to help those who have not.
“Through a bishop's order, those in need can obtain food, clothing, and other items to provide temporary relief for their basic needs.”

Founded in 1992 as the Utah Stonewall Center, the organisation offers health & wellness programs, such as free HIV testing and a directory of LGBT+ affirmative counsellors.
Every week, the Utah Pride Center serves meals to around 40 under-privileged young adults in the local LGBT community.
The donation is surprising, as the Mormon Church remains a strong opponent of LGBT rights, just two months ago attacking the “counterfeit and alternative lifestyles that try to replace the family organization that God Himself established.”
In contrast, the Church stated in its grant letter: “We are grateful to be able to serve your efforts in this worthy project and appreciate the work that you and others are doing related to this initiative.”
The LGBT community has had a rocky relationship with the organization, as the Church supported California's Proposition 8 against same-sex marriage in 2008.
The official website of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints still features pieces in opposition of the SCOTUS ruling, such as, “Church Leaders Counsel Members after Supreme Court Same-Sex Marriage Decision.”
The letter continues into a more positive attitude, however, stating: “The gospel of Jesus Christ teaches us to love and treat all people with kindness and civility—even when we disagree.
“We affirm that those who avail themselves of laws or court rulings authorizing same‐sex marriage should not be treated disrespectfully.
“Indeed, the Church has advocated for rights of same‐sex couples in matters of hospitalization and medical care, fair housing and employment, and probate, so long as these do not infringe on the integrity of the traditional family or the constitutional rights of churches.”
Photo: Utah Pride Center Facebook page
Recently, however, the Utah law preventing discrimination towards the LGBT community in employment and housing was backed by the Mormon Church in exchange for ‘religious freedom' exemptions.
LGBT-friendly Mormon organisations, like Mormons for Equality and Mormons Building Bridges, have sprung up in recent years- some members overjoyed at the legalisation of same-sex marriage throughout the country.
The UK is negotiating its exit from the European Union after the country voted to leave in a referendum in June 2016.
As it stands, the UK will depart the EU on 30 March 2019 but the terms of its withdrawal and the nature of its future relationship with the EU are yet to be decided. So what is being discussed and by whom?
What's being discussed and when?
Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The one million British expats living on the continent are among those holding their breath for the outcome
In the first phase of negotiations, British and EU officials are meeting each month for four days in Brussels, the home of the European Commission.
So far, there have been two rounds of talks. The first one, in June, was largely a get-to-know you session in which both sides sized each other up, engaged in a few official pleasantries and discussed scheduling issues.
July's session was much more serious and detailed, with full discussions taking place in four key areas: the rights of EU citizens in the UK and Britons on the continent, the future of the 300 mile land border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, general separation issues, and the question of money.
Matters are at an early stage and there has been no agreement in any of these areas yet. The two sides will next meet in the last week of August.
Who is doing the talking?
Image copyright European Commission Image caption David Davis and Michel Barnier are old sparring partners, having first dealt with each other in the 1990s
The UK team is led by David Davis, the veteran Conservative MP who is Secretary of State for Exiting The European Union. Their EU counterpart is Michel Barnier, a former French foreign minister and EU commissioner who was chosen by the other 27 EU member states to represent them.
Both sides are deploying a Olympic-size squad of officials to work on the negotiations. Much of the spadework is being done by co-ordinators or "sherpas", senior officials whose job it is to pore over the nitty-gritty details and try and pave the way for a political agreement.
The lead British sherpa is Oliver Robbins, the top civil servant in the Brexit department.
Other key figures on the British side include Sir Tim Barrow, the UK's permanent representative in Brussels and Simon Case, David Cameron's former private secretary who is now director general of the UK-EU partnership, which is looking at post-Brexit co-operation.
Much progress so far?
Image copyright PA Image caption The government says its offer to EU citizens living and working in the UK is "serious and fair"
This is difficult to gauge and depends, to an extent, on which side you listen to.
The UK and EU have set out their respective positions on citizens rights, highlighting areas of convergence in green, disagreement in red and areas that need further discussion and "deeper understanding" in amber.
The UK is stressing what it regards as areas of consensus while pushing back on any suggestions that its offer is less generous than the EU's in terms of granting permanent residence, or settled status, to its three or so a million EU residents, and accompanying rights, including of family reunion.
The EU has expressed mild disappointment at the UK's approach so far and there is genuine disagreement over how new guarantees will be legally enforced.
David Davis said the EU was only offering restricted residency rights to Britons living in the EU. The UK is questioning that.
Their offer "only guarantees residence rights in the member state in which a British national was resident at the point of our exit from the EU," they said in a letter to Lord Jay of the parliamentary committee on Brexit.
"It does not guarantee the holder of those residence rights any right to onward movement within the EU, for example to work or study in a neighbouring member state," they said.
Nor will the EU maintain existing voting rights for UK nationals living in the EU after Brexit, they said.
On the issue of finance, reports spoke of "robust" discussions about the UK's so-called "divorce bill" and the "need for flexibility" on both sides can be interpreted as diplomatic-speak for the two parties not seeing eye to eye.
The UK has spoken of "sorting out the obligations we have to one another" but media reports of the government being handed a "legacy" bill of up to 100bn euros (£89bn) has prompted a vociferous response from British ministers.
The reality appears to be that no detailed sums have been discussed yet and it has been widely reported any settlement is unlikely before the end of 2018.
One other running theme of the discussions so far has been the EU's constant plea for more clarity from British negotiators.
The UK has hit back, pointing out that it has been publishing position papers ahead of each round of negotiations, most recently on judicial proceedings, nuclear regulation and privileges and immunities.
The Irish dimension
Image copyright Reuters Image caption Upholding the Good Friday Agreement and the Common Travel Area are key priorities for the talks
Talks over the Irish border and related issues are being handled at the highest level, reflecting what the EU has acknowledged are the "unique circumstances and challenges" facing the island of Ireland.
For months, the joint mantra from both Dublin and London has been that after Brexit, the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland should be as "seamless and frictionless as possible" and nothing should be done to endanger the peace process and political progress made over the past 25 years.
But cracks seems to be surfacing amid concerns in Dublin that technological solutions - such as number plate recognition and computerised trader schemes - are not sufficient in themselves to address the risk of smuggling and a wider political agreement is needed.
Unionist parties in Northern Ireland have reacted angrily to suggestions that customs controls could be moved to seaports and airports, rather than anywhere near the land border, which they say would create an unacceptable divide between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK.
Given the fragility of power-sharing in Northern Ireland, and the frisson caused by the Conservatives' parliamentary pact with the Democratic Unionists, there seem to be real obstacles to overcome before this most sensitive of subjects is settled to the satisfaction of all.
What about trade?
Image copyright EPA Image caption Many carriers want an aviation agreement by the summer of 2018
The end of October, when EU leaders will hold their first post-summer summit, has been talked up as something of a watershed moment.
If the 27 agree that sufficient progress has been made on separation, rights and financial issues, it is possible they could agree to begin negotiations on trade and the all-important question of the UK's future relationship with its largest commercial partner.
The UK had wanted talks on divorce and trade to take place in tandem but the EU said no, also insisting that no agreement on a future trade deal - which would involve a new treaty - can be finalised until the UK has actually left the EU.
More recently, EU sources have suggested that October is not set in stone and any decision could slip until the end of the year.
As we move into 2018, there will be attention on areas vital to the British economy such as financial services, aviation and agriculture.
Airlines have said agreement on the UK's future within the European Common Aviation Area and its participation in the Open Skies transatlantic system is needed by the summer of 2018 to allow them to schedule flights six months ahead.
There have been warnings of chaos and passengers not being able to travel in and out of the UK.
Is the UK government united?
Image copyright AFP Image caption Downing Street has sought to downplay the extent of cabinet divisions over Brexit
In a major speech in January, Theresa May committed the UK to leaving the EU's single market and the customs union, saying the UK must be able to control its own borders and negotiate its own trade agreements with other countries.
At the same time, they said the UK wanted tariff-free trade with the EU after Brexit and a new customs agreement. They also talked of an "implementation period" after the UK leaves the EU and an end to the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice (ECJ) as the supremacy of EU law ceases.
This government line generally held firm during the general election campaign but has come under pressure since the Conservatives lost their Commons majority, with several cabinet ministers breaking ranks to emphasise what they see as their priorities for the negotiation.
Chancellor Philip Hammond has made it clear that economic stability and business certainty is paramount and suggested there is cabinet support for a transitional period of up to three years in which the status quo would be maintained in many areas to help business to adjust.
Brexit-supporting colleagues, such as Liam Fox and Michael Gove, have indicated they have no objection to the principle of a phased transition.
But the devil will be in the detail and many Tory MPs are likely to fiercely resist any concessions which would allow the free movement of people from the EU to continue in its current form - something Downing Street has ruled out - or which would give the ECJ any interim role.
Will a deal be done and by when?
Image copyright Reuters Image caption Some MEPs have suggested the agreement of the European Parliament is by no means guaranteed
Mr Barnier has not been slow to remind British officials that the "clock is ticking" on the negotiations.
What was, by general agreement, a very tight two-year process to start off with has been further condensed by the UK's snap general election, which meant a two-month delay to the start of talks.
While EU summits in March and June 2018 will be important staging posts, the real crunch is expected to come in the autumn of 2018.
A deal will effectively have to be agreed by this point if it is to be approved by Parliament, the European Parliament and by EU states - 72% of whom will have to vote for it under super-qualified majority rules - in time to meet the Article 50 withdrawal deadline.
With the EU sticking to its mantra that "nothing is agreed until everything is agreed", this period could become what one football manager famously described as "squeaky bum" time.
The UK could leave before March 2019 if a withdrawal agreement is agreed earlier, although this would seem unlikely at this stage.
There also remains the possibility that the UK could simply leave without any agreement, if either of the two sides reject a deal or can't agree on one and decide against extending the talks.
For many critics of Brexit, this is the doomsday scenario but many Leave supporters are relaxed about what it would entail. The government says it is preparing for every eventuality but believes it will secure a deal that works for both sides.
Finance Minister Joe Ceci says they won't prejudge discussions on new taxing powers for Calgary and Edmonton as they take over the responsibility for city charters.
Premier Rachel Notley handed Ceci the file on city charters — which the NDP government hopes to have in place later this year — in Thursday's mini cabinet shuffle.
Ceci told Postmedia Friday they know the province's two biggest cities have issues have a need for stable, predictable funding but the former Ward 9 alderman for Calgary was non-committal on taxing powers.
"Those things will be discussed at the table. Rather than prejudging where things are going to go, I'm going to go into this with the interests of a former city councillor and a current finance minister of the province," said Ceci, the MLA for Calgary-Fort.
"I look forward to getting together with both mayors soon."
City charters are documents that are intended to give new powers and responsibilities to Calgary and Edmonton. The mayors of each city — Naheed Nenshi and Don Iveson — have said their municipalities need increased revenue and greater power over their finances, although that doesn't necessarily mean new powers to tax beyond property tax.
Nenshi, in Ottawa for a meeting of Canada's big-city mayors, said Friday they had spoken to Ceci and new NDP Municipal Affairs Minister Shaye Anderson shortly after the cabinet shuffle.
They said he's encouraged that Ceci has been given the city charter file as the fiscal framework for municipalities is the major area left for discussion.
"Finance has to be intimately involved in that so I'm taking it as a sign that they're being very serious — by putting them there — about a brand new fiscal framework," said Nenshi.
The mayor reiterated however that they expect any new taxing powers to be minimal, such as a revamped hotel tax or vehicle fees for road maintenance.
But Wildrose finance critic Derek Fildebrandt is concerned about the implications of Ceci's appointment and said there should be no taxing powers for cities without approval through a referendum.
"As the minister of finance, Joe Ceci has shown no hesitancy towards any number of new taxes, and as a city councillor … they were enthusiastic for new taxes at every possible opportunity," they said.
Fildebrandt also took aim at the NDP government's consultations for its March provincial budget, which continued Friday in Calgary.
They said the invite-only events mean that the government is unlikely to hear opposing viewpoints such as calls for real fiscal restraint to reduce a deficit currently estimated at more than $10 billion.
Representatives from more than 40 non-profits, social agencies and businesses met with Ceci at McDougall Centre.
Following the meeting, the minister said the participants fully understood the fiscal challenges faced by the government, which has seen its bottom line hammered by low oil prices over its first year-and-a-half in office.
Their response of those in the room, they said, is that the government needs to be innovative in how it delivers services.
"I think we should undertake that challenge. So it's going to mean asking questions that are perhaps more uncomfortable — does this have to be done by government or can it be done elsewhere by someone else in a different way and Albertans still get the benefit of quality service deliver?" said Ceci.

Early July 2017 saw the release of photos showing a single BMPT-72 “Terminator” tank support combat vehicle in service with the Liva al-Quds Palestinian brigade serving with Syrian government forces. So far there have been no indications the vehicle has seen combat use, and it also appears that the vehicle was sent to Syria mainly for combat evaluation rather than in response to any urgent tactical requirement.
The BMPT concept represents an answer to the need to provide a high volume of suppressive fire against enemy anti-tank guided weapons and static weapon emplacements such as machine-gun nests. While modern infantry fighting vehicles are usually armed with automatic cannon which can fill that function, their inferior level of protection means they are hard-pressed to truly accompany tanks and are instead forced to provide overwatch fire with anti-tank guided missiles which limits their ability to use their cannon. The use of anti-aircraft weapons, either purpose-designed vehicles or gun trucks with towed anti-aircraft guns mounted on their platforms, suffers from a similar limitation. The only way to get around these problems, which Russian forces discovered when fighting in Afghanistan and Chechnya, is to develop a heavily armored vehicle that replaces a tank's main gun with automatic cannon. This vehicle was Obyekt 199 “Ramka”, which over the years matured into the BMPT-72.
BMPT-72 is, as the name implies, based on the successful and popular T-72 main battle tank chassis. This choice facilitates integration into T-72 tank formations from the perspective of mobility, maintenance, and training. Its armament consists of two 2A42 30mm automatic cannon with a total of 850 rounds in the turret, and two AG-30 30mm automatic grenade launchers mounted over the tracks and controlled by the two “bow gunners.” To deal with long-range threats, the vehicle carries four ready-to-fire 9M120 Ataka laser-guided supersonic anti-tank missiles with a range of up to 10km in the case of the most recent models and carrying either HEAT or thermobaric warheads, depending on mission requirements.
As of early 2017, the BMPT-72 is officially in service only with the armed forces of Kazakhtan, which took the receipt of 10 such vehicles between 2011 and 2013. The vehicle spotted in Syria deviates slightly from the Kazakhstani vehicles in that it carries only a low-light image intensification sight rather than a thermal imager, which makes the vehicle less expensive and is not a great handicap in Syrian conditions where it is not expected to fight duels with advanced MBTs equipped with thermal imagers. Its protection is also different in that it carries Relikt second-generation reactive armor and soft armor packages protecting the sides so far seen only on up-armored T-72B3 tanks in Russian and Belarusian service.
BMPT-72's appearance in Syria coincided with reports that the Russian Ground Forces are about to procure a number of these vehicles themselves, most likely for use by brigades and divisions operating T-72 and T-90 MBTs. BMPT-72 was not part of earlier procurement plans because it was expected that units equipped with the new T-14 MBT of the Armata family will also include the T-15 heavy infantry fighting which was designed in part to fill the same niche as the BMPT. The T-15 prototypes shown at the 2015 Victory Parade carried an unmanned turret with a single 30mm cannon and 4 Kornet ATGMs, and automatic cannon with caliber of up to 57mm are known to be in development and testing for use on the T-15 and other IFVs.
However, the expansion of the size of the Ground Forces meant that T-72 and T-90 MBTs would remain in service for longer than expected, which in turn revived Russian interest in procuring the BMPT-72.

You have your air compressor and powder coating gun and you are ready to start powder coating? Not so fast, make sure you read this article first. When powder coating or sandblasting, you need clean, dry air. More than just compressed air comes out of the outlet of your air compressor. Water, dirt, and oil will also be included in this compressed air. It is very important that you treat your compressed air and remove these contaminants when using your air compressor for powder coating. The same information I am about to provide also applies to auto painting, compressed air machinery, or even just using common air tools. Any tool that connects to your air compressor will appreciate a clean air supply. Read this article: How to Choose an Air Compressor if you haven't purchased an air compressor yet.

Videogame maker Electronic Arts Inc. EA, +2.75% is exploring a sale as the company struggles to grow its business amid competition from free online gaming sites, the New York Post reported, citing sources.
The paper reported EA has been approached by private-equity giants KKR and Providence Equity Partners about a potential deal.
Representatives for EA weren't immediately available for comment.
EA is the maker of such popular video games as "SimCity" and "Madden NFL" and had a market value of $4.17 billion as of Wednesday's close.
Shares climbed 17% to $15.25 in light premarket trading and are down 36% this year.
The paper quotes a source familiar with the company saying EA would do a deal at $20 a share. It last traded above that price in January.
EA has reported mixed results in recent periods as softer demand for console videogames has hurt margins and as it faces increased competition from free-access online games. Last month, EA reported fiscal first-quarter earnings fell 9% as the company's core revenue slipped.
The company is looking to transform its business model to better compete against rivals such as Zynga Inc. ZNGA, +0.00% which has expanded its business to better support Internet-based sales.

Two years ago the trans sister of NBA player Reggie Bullock, Mia Henderson, was shot and killed.
At that time Bullock sent out a tweet calling their sister by their former name and gender, publicly offering not much more. Last week they sat down with Nick Wright on the national radio show "The Herd" and opened up more about having a trans sister. This observation jumped out at me as particularly important [gender pronouns were changed to reflect Henderson's true gender]:
"A lot of people joke and do all these type of things about those type of people. But me, it touches me, because I had a [sister], I had a person who was that way. So never will I laugh, never will I do any type of those things about people who go through those different ways in life. [She] was just strong. That was pretty much the thing I got from [her]. [She] left me with that and that's how I go about my life."
If Henderson had not come out to their brother and lived their life openly, would Bullock be on national radio talking about trans acceptance? No chance. Their quote above pretty much says, "I have come to accept trans people because I loved my sibling." That Bullock opened their heart and mind to their sister, and is now talking about the issue in such a positive way, is a testament to him, their sister, and the power of coming out and being out.
To be sure, there are still issues about how Bullock identifies their sister [again, the gender Bullock used has been changed in editorial brackets above], and frankly that has been echoed in the sports media's reporting of last week's interview. Everywhere I look there are editorial references to Bullock's sister by their former name and gender. Even Wright, conducting the interview, routinely referred to Henderson's former gender.
Yet there seems to be more of a lack of awareness than a lack of acceptance. People still don't fully understand how to talk about trans issues. That will continue to improve with time.
So let's not lose sight of Bullock's message of love and acceptance. It's yet still another reminder about the power of coming out and being out. If Henderson had not come out and lived their life authentically, Bullock likely would not feel the way they do about trans people, and they said as much.
Government subsidies to the nuclear power industry over the past fifty years have been so large in proportion to the value of the energy produced that in some cases it would have cost taxpayers less to simply buy kilowatts on the open market and give them away, according to a February 2011 report by the Union of Concerned Scientists.
The report, Nuclear Power: Still Not Viable without Subsidies, looks at the economic impacts and policy implications of subsidies to the nuclear power industry—past, present, and proposed.
How would you like your subsidy?
Nuclear power subsidies vary by type of ownership (public or private), time frame of support (legacy, ongoing, or new), and the type of cost (or “attribute of production”) they address—from startup capital to decommissioning and waste disposal. Subsidies can take many forms, including tax breaks, accident liability caps, direct payments, and loan guarantees.
While the exact value of these subsidies can be difficult to pin down, even conservative estimates add up to a substantial percentage of the value of the power nuclear plants produce—approaching or even exceeding 100 percent in the case of legacy subsidies and subsidies to new privately-owned reactors (see chart).
Subsidies prove addictive
Subsidies were originally intended to provide temporary support for the fledgling nuclear power industry, but the promised day when the industry could prosper without them and power from nuclear reactors would be “too cheap to meter” has yet to arrive. It is unlikely to arrive any time soon, as cost estimates for new reactors continue to escalate and the nuclear power lobby demands even more support from taxpayers. Piling new subsidies on top of existing ones will provide the industry with little incentive to rework its business model to internalize its considerable costs and risks.
Subsidy impacts: Public risks and hidden costs
Nuclear subsidies effectively separate risk from reward, shifting the burden of possible losses onto the public and encouraging speculative investment. By masking the true cost of nuclear power, subsidies also allow the industry to exaggerate its economic competitiveness; consequently, they diminish or delay support for more economical and less risky alternatives like energy efficiency and renewable energy.
Recommendations
The report concludes with a dozen recommendations for policymakers, including reducing subsidies to existing reactors, adopting market-oriented approaches to uranium mining royalties and waste management financing, and incorporating the costs of preventing nuclear proliferation and terrorism into economic assessments of new reactors.
Sometimes you find yourself in the spotlight when you least expect it. This happened to me this week when I decided that out of conscience I could not attend a conference dedicated in part to religious freedom on a campus that denied it to its own Mormon students.
Shortly before I was planning to go the conference this weekend I received an email from a group of present and former Mormon students who called themselves “Free BYU.” Because of a Brigham Young University policy, Mormon students who lose their faith, convert to another religion, or leave the church are automatically expelled from the University; and they lose their housing, scholarship, and campus jobs at the same time. This seemed so counter to the spirit of academic freedom—and to the very issues of religious liberty that the conference was promoting—that in conscience I felt that I had to take a stand.
I had looked forward to the conference. The issue was important, the international roster of scholars participating was impressive, and my old friend and colleague, David Little, was to receive an award for their work on issues of religious tolerance around the world. They certainly deserved it. My schedule was tight but I could go for at least a day.
But then I received the Free BYU email and I knew I could not attend. All my adult life I have been a part of academic communities that have prized freedom of inquiry, intellectual openness and the life of the mind. I have been so grateful that in our society we have this one institution—the university—that preserves a domain for intellectual exchange and the marketplace of ideas. This is especially so in our current media climate that is so dominated by opinion masquerading as fact. More than ever, we need the intellectual freedom of the university.
But doesn't a religious institution have the right to set its own rules, I was asked in one email that I received in response to my decision. I received dozens of emails from present and former Mormon students at BYU supporting my position, some of them telling heartbreaking stories about how their careers were ruined by being expelled for their beliefs just months before graduation. But I also received this one email defending the university's position on expelling Mormon students who lose their faith.
Of course a church or a temple can limit membership and set its own standards of belief—within its own walls. But we bristle when those standards are imposed outside. I noted that BYU accepts non-Mormon students on campus and does not dissuade them from converting to the Mormon faith. But if a Mormon student rebels, they or they are axed. This is not just unfair, it seems to me, but contrary to the spirit of what a university is.
A university that calls itself a university is a public institution. It is not a Sunday school. Regardless of who sponsors it, the university is a public trust. It provides necessary skills to accredit individuals for jobs in the public arena, and just as important, it provides that social space that I referred to above—the arena for the free expression of ideas—that is important for an educated society and for an individual's own intellectual growth.
But what about honor codes that many universities impose? These are usually attempts to regulate behavior—not thought. They attempt to prohibit, for example, alcohol and pot in student dorms. Prohibitions against thinking, against ideas that are counter to administrators' beliefs, however, should have no place in a university.
Although I am not an expert in issues of religious freedom in American higher education, I do not know of many attempts to prohibit the free expression of thought. It would be as if a university expelled a student for accepting the scientific account of evolution, or if another university expelled a student for voting Democrat. Perhaps such cases exist, but I would be opposed to them as well.
And if a religious organization sponsors a university shouldn't it be allowed to set the rules? Well, yes and no. When it comes to freedom of thought, I'd say no. If some rich donors come to our campus (as indeed they have) and want to create a position to promote their own ideas, we might thank them for their money but politely explain to them that the university is dedicated to the life of the mind and the free expression of views and they can't control what our faculty and students think. Neither should the church nor any other entity that wants to sponsor a university.
I'm one of those rare academics who is a practicing Christian. I love the church, but I also love the academic community and its standards of honest inquiry into the truth. I believe that the two, church and campus, should be free from each other's meddling—for the sake of both.

(Some versions of the map include Ohio in Canada or Alberta in Jesusland) "United States of Canada", "United States of Canada", Canada , plus blue states "Jesusland", "Jesusland", red states A recreation of the Jesusland map; the colors differ from the original, and state lines have been added
The Jesusland map is an Internet meme created shortly after the 2004 U.S. presidential election that satirizes the red/blue states scheme by dividing the United States and Canada into "The United States of Canada" and "Jesusland".[1] The map implies the existence of a fundamental political divide between contiguous northern and southern regions of North America, the former including both the socially liberal Canada and the West Coast, Northeastern, and Upper Midwestern states, and suggests that these states are closer in spirit to Canada than to the more conservative regions of their own country. The Freakonomics blog opined that the map reflected the "despair, division, and bitterness" of the election campaign and results.[2] Slate also covered the image and posited that it might be the reason the Canadian immigration website received six times its usual page views the day after the election.[3]
Origin [ edit ]
The original image was created on November 3, 2004 by G. Webb, a poster on yakyak.org, an Internet message board for fans of the work of Jeff Minter.[4] It quickly became an Internet meme, which The New York Times described as an "instant Internet classic".[5]
Geography [ edit ]
The meme is in the form of a map of the U.S. and Canada which depicts a new hypothetical national border between the two countries. The "blue states" from the 2004 election (New England, the Mid-Atlantic states, the Pacific coast, and the Great Lakes states of Illinois, Michigan, Minnesota, and Wisconsin) have been merged with Canada to form a single contiguous nation of more than 170 million inhabitants, which is labeled the "United States of Canada." The remaining "red states" are labeled as "Jesusland".
Variations [ edit ]
Similar maps give different labels to the geographically separated blue states. The northeastern states are alternately referred to as "Eastern Realitania", "Northeastistan", "Western France", or "The New American Republic"; the central blue states near the Great Lakes are labeled "Central Realitania" or "Minniwillinois"; and the blue states along the Pacific Coast are called "Western Realitania", "Pacificstan", "Southern Canada" or "Baja Canada" (with Hawaii being separately labeled "The Tropic of Canada"). Another has chosen the overall name "Realistan", and another has chosen "The United States of Liberty and Education". The red states in these variant maps are called "Jesusistan", or "the United State of Texas" in reference to Bush's home state. Some maps purport to show a capital city of Crawford, Texas, then the home of former U.S. President George W. Bush. One map shows Alaska as having been returned to Russia, while a Canadian variant had the province of Alberta, commonly regarded as the most conservative Canadian province, marked as part of Jesusland instead of Canada.

Consider modelling the Clinton/Trump debate via a static game in which each candidate can choose between two strategies: , where denotes predominantly “attacking” the other candidate, while denotes predominantly discussing policy positions.
Further, let us consider the mixed strategies for Clinton, and for Trump. That is, Clinton predominantly attacks Trump with probability , and Trump predominantly attacks Clinton with probability .
Let us first deal with the general case of arbitrary payoffs, thus, generating the following payoff matrix:
That is, if Clinton attacks Trump and Trump attacks Clinton, the payoff to Clinton is , while the payoff to Trump is . If Clinton attacks Trump, and Trump ignores and discusses policy positions instead, the payoff to Clinton is , while the payoff to trump is . If Clinton discusses policy positions while Trump attacks, the payoff to Clinton is , while the payoff to Trump is , and if both candidates discuss policy positions instead of attacking each other, the payoff to them both will be and respectively.
With this information in hand, we can calculate the payoff to Clinton as:
while the payoff to Trump is:
With these payoff functions, we can compute each candidate's best response to the other candidate by solving the following equations:
where indicates the best response strategy to a fixed strategy for the other player.
Solving these equations, we obtain the following:
If
then,
Clinton's best response is to choose .
If
then,
Clinton's best response is to choose .
Otherwise, their best response is to choose .
While for Trump, the best responses are computed as follows:
If
Trump's best response is to choose .
If
Trump's best response is to choose .
Otherwise, Trump's best response is to choose .
To demonstrate this, let us work out an example. Assume (for this example) that the payoffs for each candidate are to sway independent voters / voters that have not made up their minds. Further, let us assume that these voters are more interested in policy positions, and will take attacks negatively. Obviously, this is not necessarily true, and we have solved the general case above. We are just using the following payoff matrix for demonstration purposes:
Using the above equations, we see that if , Clinton's best response is to choose . While, if , Trump's best response is to choose . That is, no matter what Trump's strategy is, it is always Clinton's best response to discuss policy positions. No matter what Clinton's strategy is, it is always Trump's best response to discuss policy positions as well. The two candidates' payoff functions take the following form:
What this shows for example is that there is a Nash equilibrium of:
.
The expected payoffs for each candidate are evidently
.
Let us work out an example. This time, assume that if Clinton attacks Trump, they receive a payoff of , while if Trump attacks Clinton, they receive a payoff of . While, if Clinton discusses policy, while being attacked by Trump, they receive a payoff of , while Trump receives a payoff of . On the other hand, if Trump discusses policy while being attacked by Clinton, they receive a payoff , while Clinton receives a payoff of . If Clinton discusses policy, while Trump discusses policy, they receive a payoff of , while Trump receives a payoff of . The payoff matrix is evidently:
In this case, if , then Clinton's best response is to choose . While, if , then Trump's best response is to choose . The Nash equilibrium is evidently
.
The expected payoffs for each candidate are evidently
.
In this example, even though it is the optimal strategy for each candidate to play a mixed strategy of 50% attack, 50% discuss policy, Clinton is expected to benefit, while Trump is expected to lose.
Let us also consider an example of where the audience is biased towards Trump. So, every time Trump attacks Clinton, they gain an additional point. Every time Trump discusses policy, while Clinton does the same they gain an additional point. While, if Clinton attacks while Trump discusses policy positions, they will lose a point, and they gain a point. Such a payoff matrix can be given by:
Solving the equations above, we find that if , Clinton's best response is to choose . If , Clinton's best response is to choose . Otherwise, their best response is to choose . On the other hand, if , Trump's best response is to choose . While, if , Trump's best response is to choose . Evidently, there is a single Nash equilibrium (as long as ):
.
Therefore, in this situation, it is each candidate's best strategy to attack one another. It is interesting that even in an audience that is heavily biased towards Trump, Clinton's best strategy is still to attack 100% of the time.
The interested reader is invited to experiment with different scenarios using the general results derived above.

The one thing that separates the best strikers in the world from the rest of us is timing. Timing is the difference between landing a clean strike on an opponent or having your shins busted from leg checks.
The question is how do you develop better timing? The answer is very simple: sparring
Timing is developed in training by sparring against opponents who are actively trying to defend against your strikes. If you practice throwing leg kicks against someone who stands idle and allows you to kick them, it won't teach you how to land leg kicks against a real opponent.
While most people understand the importance of sparring, there are a lot of people that don't understand the right sparring levels.
Typically there are 3 different sparring levels that you will encounter in Muay Thai: Technical Sparring, Medium Sparring, and Hard Sparring.

Most people who spar 100% are not doing it because they are trying to be an asshole (a few people definitely are) most of them are doing it because that is probably the culture at the gym. Every gym has their own norms.
If you are training in at a gym that has a lot of testosterone and egos floating around, you can bet that there are going to be a few guys who go too hard in sparring.
Defining Technical Sparring
Technical sparring is sparring that is done at a controlled pace without throwing any power behind your strikes. This means that every punch and kick you throw is under complete control. You should be able to spar without any pads on and walk away without any bruises or busted up shins.
When you land a punch on your opponent, they shouldn't feel any pain from the strike. Everything that you land should be controlled so there is no risk of getting injured during the sparring.
Technical sparring is a difficult concept for people who are used to swinging for the fence against their sparring partners. If you are used to sparring with full power, it is very difficult trying to dial back that mind set and focus on developing your technique and timing.
In addition to technical sparring, someone who is preparing for a fight should also understand the benefits of Hard sparring. Learning how to get hit is a skill that is only developed through experience. Read: A Guide to Hard Sparring in Muay Thai – Everything You Should Know
When someone first starts sparring, it is important to slow everything down in a controlled environment. Beginners need to get used to the idea of someone punching and kicking them, without worrying about getting knocked out by their opponents.
As a person progresses and becomes more comfortable sparring, they can start to add speed to their strikes, while still holding back from using power. Good technical sparring is very controlled, but at the same time both sparring partners throw strikes with speed to try and get through their opponents defense.
The Importance of Technical Sparring in Muay Thai Development
For many people, sparring is the closest thing they will come to getting ring experience. Starting out, sparring can intimidate a lot of people, especially those who are not used to getting hit.
Being scared in sparring will result in the body becoming tenser, which will lead to poor technique and bad habits. If you take someone who is new to sparring and put them in a situation that makes them scared, they will throw their strikes without confidence. If you are tense when you strike, it can wreck havoc on your form.
Sparring with poor technique will result in you cementing bad habits that can take years to undo. This is why you should ALWAYS start off sparring in a very controlled and soft environment.
Technical sparring allows you to improve and work on different things, without worrying about injuries
If you take away the fear of getting ‘rocked' by a punch or hurt with a kick, it is much easier to stay relaxed when you spar. Staying relaxed will allow you to work on your technique, timing and speed of your strikes, without being tense.
This is how you develop good technique that will translate into the ring when you fight.

What Technical Sparring Should Look Like
If you want to see a real example of technical sparring in action, watch this sparring video of Penake and myself playing around. Notice how there is no power behind any of the strikes. This sparring is great for working on your timing on offense and defense.
Things to Look For:
Control your strikes, if you land a clean strike on your opponent it shouldn't hurt them.
Use Muay Thai techniques that you have worked on in training (except elbows)
Allow your sparring partner to work on their offense and defense also.
Be fluid and always stay in your Muay Thai rhythm
Try to stay relaxed and focus on using correct techniques
Here is a short video I made demonstrating some light technical sparring with Dane Sky. I review some important points in this video to help you with your sparring. Check it out below:
Technical Sparring Will Make You Better
If you want to improve your timing you need to focus on technical sparring. Technical sparring is the best way to improve your technique, timing, and rhythm, without worrying about any injuries.
While it may not seem realistic when you spar at a light pace, you will be working on a number of important skills that will benefit your game. Beginners who start off trying to spar at full power, end up developing a lot of bad habits because they don't have a good Muay Thai foundation.
By focusing on your technique over power, you will be able to develop a good foundation, rather than worrying about getting knocked out when you spar. Sparring in a safe environment will also teach you how to think when you spar, which will make you a better fighter.

Norwegian Chess Federation President Jøran Aulin-Jansson has written an open letter giving their reflections on the recent Chess Olympiad and World Chess Federation (FIDE) elections in Tromsø. In particular, they bemoan the large proportion of European chess federation delegates who voted for long-standing FIDE President Kirsan Ilyumzhinov, claiming only a handful had the best interests of chess in mind.
Jøran Aulin-Jansson, who was a candidate for European Chess Union Deputy President on Silvio Danailov's ticket, addressed their letter to chess players:
Reflections of Elections
As president of the Norwegian Chess Federation, I have a lot of impressions in the aftermath of the Olympiad and, especially, the elections in Tromsø that I would like to share with you, dear chess player.
First of all, I would like to express my deepest condolences to those who were close to Kurt Meier and Alisher Anarkulov, who tragically passed away during the event. Second, I congratulate China and Russia for their victory in the Open and Women's sections.
Although the Olympiad turned out to be far from our dreams when we got it in Khanty-Mansiysk four years ago, I hope the majority found the trip worthwhile. I will not go into details, but I found some of the criticism fairly agreeable. We also got a lot of praise, and that makes it all better again.
Let me start my comments on the election with stating that I am not a sore loser. But I think we now have all become… well, not sore, but losers anyhow.
Although there are some good people within the leadership of FIDE, I was, and still am, convinced it is time for a change. Many of those in leading positions have been there for decades and cannot run from their responsibility for the state of things today. FIDE is not in the condition one would expect from a sport that engages millions and millions of people around the whole world. FIDE's budget is 2-3 million Euros per year and we struggle to find organizers for our most prestigious events. We have been around for 90 years, and it's not rocket science that will take us to paradise. It's hard and honest work for the benefit of FIDE and for chess, not for personal benefit.
Let's quickly compare FIDE and chess with another organization and sport, IBU, the International Biathlon Union, established in 1993 and so a relatively young sport. Compared to FIDE, they have a fraction of the members and a fraction of the followers. Still, they enjoy a yearly income of more than 20 million Euros from corporate sponsorship! And there is fierce competition among countries to organize events…
So, for this and many other reasons it is clear that we as an international sports organization could have done a lot better. But as long as 110 delegates and proxy givers think otherwise, what to do? I am very doubtful that all of those who voted for Mr. Ilyumzhinov did this with a conviction that is been for the benefit of chess.
I know some of you might say: We cannot vote for Garry.  They are arrogant, they do not care about us, they care about politics, or they are too aggressive, too direct, too honest…
Well, maybe you are to some small extent right, but they would have delivered their promises and done much for chess and your federations. Instead, we now have an empty promise of 20 million USD from Mr. Ilyumzhinov. Allegedly 19.5 of them have already been invested in a chess in school project. We all heard that in the General Assembly, some of you laughed out loud, but still voted for this!
Europe has in the past elections always been the threshold of opponents to the incumbent leadership of FIDE. According to Mr. Huba, more than 80% of all organized chess activity happens in Europe. So, of course we are pushing for an improved and developed FIDE.
I cannot claim that I know who voted for whom, but I do have a rough idea with regards to the choices made by the European delegates. More than 30 delegates/proxies favored Mr. Ilyumzhinov.
That's a number that deeply saddens me! Of course, we should assume that some of these actually voted for Mr. Ilyumzhinov with the motive best for chess, but not more than a handful of them. I cannot understand how the other delegates happily sacrifice the development of chess for their own benefit. It's a disgrace, and I hope they will be challenged for their deplorable actions.
Corruption and nepotism are easy to shout but difficult to prove. I will not speculate whether this has happened or not, but I cannot rule this out. For those of you with a particular interest in this subject, and I hope you are many, ask your delegate who they voted for, and why. It should not be up to the delegate to vote any way they or they please. They should reflect their federations' true will.
Another interesting source of information is to look among the names of the people who either were appointed by the president of FIDE, or elected by the delegates/proxies to important positions in the power structure in FIDE, all with support from the incumbent administration.
On behalf of Europe, I am truly embarrassed and disappointed. As a paying member of a European chess federation, wake up, and start caring for our FIDE.

After a 17-year-old shot three people at the Monroeville Mall, CBL and Associates, the mall owner, said it will card and eject unaccompanied minors from the mall on Fridays and Saturdays after 6 p.m. beginning on Feb. 27.
“We've examined a lot of our incidences over the past year and found that a lot of the problems that have occurred have been a result of unsupervised youth,” Stacey Keating, CBL's corporate marketing specialist, told KDKA money editor Jon Delano on Monday.
“They've instituted this in about 25 other malls, and it's a very successful policy,” noted Monroeville mayor Gregory Erosenko who supports this Youth Escort Policy. “We're certainly going to put our arms around it.”

“Security officers are going to be prepared to ask for identification if a person's age cannot be easily determined and they appear to be under the age of 18,” added Keating.
The carding may occur at mall entrances or within the mall–with minors required to have a parent, grandparent, aunt or uncle, or guardian with them.
Older siblings don't count, and it's one adult for every three children.

Early life [ edit ]
Mani Shankar Aiyer is the son of Vaidyanatha Shankar Aiyar, a chartered accountant, and Bhagyalakshmi Shankar Aiyar. They were born in Laxmi Mansions, Lahore in British India which, as post-Partition refugee property, came to house the family of Saadat Hassan Manto.[2] Their older brother is the well known journalist, Swaminathan Aiyar. They lost their father at age 12 in an air crash.
They attended Welham Boys' School, The Doon School and obtained B.A. in economics from St. Stephen's College, Delhi, University of Delhi. While at Doon, they were an editor of The Doon School Weekly.[3] After the loss of their father, Aiyar's mother had to negotiate with Doon to allow them to continue their studies with reduced fees and in return they taught at the school.[4]
They graduated in economics from Delhi University, and then did a two-year B.A. in Tripos in economics at Trinity Hall, Cambridge at the University of Cambridge which, in the Oxbridge tradition, became an M.A. with the passage of time. They were a member of Trinity Hall. They were also an active member of the Marxist Society in Cambridge. At Cambridge, Aiyar joined student politics and once even tried to win a presidential contest. Rajiv Gandhi, who was their junior both at Doon and Cambridge, supported them in their campaign.
Career [ edit ]

They joined the Indian Foreign Service in 1963 and served as Joint Secretary to Government of India. They later resigned from service in 1989 to take up a career in politics and media, entering the Parliament as a Congress MP from Mayiladuthurai in 1991, 1999 and 2004 but was defeated in 1996, 1998, 2009 and 2014. They spent some time in Pakistan posted as a diplomat, serving as India's first consul-general in Karachi from 1978 to 1982.[5][6][7]
 They are a special invitee to the Congress Working Committee and was a chairperson of both the party's political training department and the department of policy planning and coordination.  They are also a well-known political columnist[citation needed] and has written several books, including Pakistan Papers and Remembering Rajiv, and has edited a four-volume publication, Rajiv Gandhi's India.
Their special interests include grassroots democracy, Indian foreign policy particularly with India's neighbouring countries, and West Asia and nuclear disarmament.
Personal life [ edit ]
They were married on 4 January 1973 to Suneet Vir Singh, a Sikh woman. They have 3 daughters – the eldest, Suranya Aiyar is a lawyer;[8] the second, Yamini Aiyar is a senior research fellow and director of the Accountability Initiative;[9] and the youngest, Sana Aiyar is an associate professor of history at MIT.[10]
Controversies [ edit ]
Mani Shankar Aiyer has been a part of many controversies.[11]
In 2000, Aiyar was involved in a public brawl with politician Amar Singh.[12] According to Singh, Aiyar insulted Singh's then party leader Mulayam Singh Yadav and remarked: "Oh that bloody Mulayam – they look just like me. It could be because my father visited Uttar Pradesh at some point. Why don't you check with Mulayam's mother?"[13]
While on a tour of the Andamans as the Cabinet Minister in the later part of 2004, Aiyar was quoted as saying at the Cellular Jail there that there was no difference between the radical right-wing revolutionary Veer Savarkar, a famous inmate of the prison, and Mohammed Ali Jinnah, the founder of Pakistan, as they shared a 'divisive' philosophy. They also ordered that a plaque with a poem commemorating Savarkar be replaced with a plaque with quotes from Mahatma Gandhi. Savarkar had been tried and acquitted for conspiring in Gandhi's assassination. Reports of the incident paralysed Parliament and led to agitations by the Shiv Sena in Maharashtra. Aiyar's remarks created confusion as well in the ruling party; the official spokesperson, Anand Sharma, noted that the Congress Party did not consider Savarkar either a freedom fighter or a patriot. A few days later, the Prime Minister dissociated themselves and the cabinet from that view.[14]
As sports minister, they effectively scuttled India's bid for Asian Games in 2007. It was widely felt that Delhi's lack of enthusiasm to host the event was the primary reason for its loss. Then Union Sports Minister of India, Mani Shankar Aiyar, spoke strongly against Delhi hosting the games and argued that it was better if the money allocated by India's government for organizing the sporting event was spent on building facilities for the poor.[15] The Indian Olympic Association (IOA) president revealed that India's Sports Minister remarks against hosting the Games was the main reason for New Delhi's loss.[16]
In September 2011, Aiyar visited their alma mater—St. Stephen's College—to speak about 'Governance and Corruption: Is Panchayati Raj A Solution?'. However, they began to mock the Hansraj College and its former student Ajay Maken. They also belittled the Kirori Mal College and the BA (Programme) Degree, a course in the University of Delhi. This led to an agitation by the students of Hansraj College. When the agitated students approached him, they mocked them even further. When later questioned by the media, Aiyar refused to apologise and rather ridiculed the institutions even further. Baffled by their remarks, Stephen's College and its students went on to apologise to Hansraj College and extended a hand of friendship.[17]
In the Rajya Sabha in August 2013, Samajwadi Party MP Naresh Agarwal accused Aiyar of being a Pakistani spy, when they refused to discuss the recent murder of 5 Indian soldiers by the Pakistani Army and instead suggested discussing rising gas prices. Aiyar reacted sharply and tried to assault Agarwal.[18]
They in an interview days before the run up to the 2014 Parliament elections in India, said that a tea seller (The Prime Ministerial candidate Narendra Modi of the BJP) can never become the Prime Minister of India, but can sell tea in AICC meetings.[19] Their comment was disowned by the congress saying it's their personal view and not the party's view.[20] Rahul Gandhi asked them not to make personal attacks.[21]
In 2015, there was widespread demand for sedition charges against Aiyar for an interview with Dawn News while visiting Pakistan.[22] Aiyar is said to have suggested that Pakistan remove Prime Minister Narendra Modi from power, to be able to continue peace talks between India and Pakistan. On February 16, 2018, Ashok Choudhary, the head of BJP's Kota district OBC wing filed a sedition and defamation case against Aiyer.[23]
Mani Shankar Aiyer justified[24] November 2015 Paris attacks as[25] a response to France banning Hijab.[26] They also justified Charlie Hebdo shooting as a backlash for the death of Muslims.[27][28] Their comments were disapproved by their own party members.[29]
After sparking a political firestorm when they called Prime Minister Narendra Modi a "neech aadmi", a casteist slur meaning "sub-human" or "lowly person". Subsequently, they were suspended from the party's primary membership. Aiyar said the comments by the PM showed their "low-level mindset and one bereft of any manners". "Mujhko lagta hai ki ye aadmi bahut neech kisam ka aadmi hai, isme koi sabhyata nahi hai. Aise mauke par is kisam ki gandi rajniti karne ki kya avashyakta hai? (This shows the low-level mindset of the PM and one bereft of any manners. What is the need of doing such dirty politics on such an occasion)," ANI quoted Aiyar as saying. Due to this comment the Congress party suspended their primary party membership.[30] After their suspension, they justified their derogatory remarks by adding "My Hindi is not very good. Yes, I called Modi 'neech' but did not mean it as a low-born; I meant it as low,".[31] They have a history of controversial statements against the former PM Atal Bihari Vajpayee. However their suspension has been revoked by Congress President Mr. Rahul Gandhi on 18.08.2018.

Years ago, Jonathan Rees became a freemason. According to journalists and investigators who worked with him, they then exploited their link with the lodges to meet masonic police officers who illegally sold them information which they peddled to Fleet Street.
As one of Britain's most prolific merchants of secrets, Rees expanded their network of sources by recruiting as their business partner Sid Fillery, a detective sergeant from the Metropolitan Police. Fillery added more officers to their network. Rees also boasted of recruiting corrupt Customs officers, a corrupt VAT inspector and two corrupt bank employees.
Other police contacts are said to have been blackmailed into providing confidential information. One of Rees's former associates claims that Rees had compromising photographs of serving officers, including one who was caught in a drunken state with a couple of prostitutes and with a toilet seat around their neck.
It is this network of corruption which lies at the heart of yesterday's claim in the House of Commons by Labour MP Tom Watson that Rees was targeting politicians, members of the royal family and even terrorist informers on behalf of Rupert Murdoch's News International. The Guardian's own inquiries suggest that Watson knows what they are talking about.
Much of what the police sources were able to sell to Rees was directly related to crime. But Rees also bought and sold confidential data on anybody who was of interest to their Fleet Street clients, to which the police often had special access. The Guardian has confirmed that Rees reinforced their official contacts with two specialist 'blaggers' who would telephone the Inland Revenue, the DVLA, banks and phone companies and trick them into handing over private data.
One of the blaggers who regularly worked for him, John Gunning, was responsible for obtaining details of bank accounts belonging to Prince Edward and the Countess of Wessex, which were then sold to the Sunday Mirror. Gunning was later convicted of illegally obtaining confidential data from British Telecom. Rees also obtained details of accounts at Coutts Bank belonging to the Duke and Duchess of Kent. The bank accounts of Sarah Ferguson, Duchess of York, are also thought to have been compromised.
Confidential data
The Guardian has been told that Rees spoke openly about obtaining confidential data belonging to senior politicians and recorded their names in their paperwork. One source close to Rees claims that apart from Tony Blair, Jack Straw, Peter Mandelson and Alastair Campbell, they also targeted Gaynor Regan, who became the second wife of the former foreign secretary Robin Cook; the former shadow home secretary Sir Gerald Kaufman; and the former Tory cabinet minister David Mellor.
It is not yet known precisely what Rees was doing to obtain information on these political targets, although in the case of Mandelson it appears that Rees acquired confidential details of two bank accounts they held at Coutts, and their building society account at Britannia. Rees is also said to have targeted the bank accounts of members of Mandelson's family.
An investigator who worked for Rees claims they were also occasionally commissioning burglaries of public figures to steal material for newspapers. Southern Investigations has previously been implicated in handling paperwork that was stolen by a professional burglar from the safe of Paddy Ashdown's lawyer, when Ashdown was leader of the Liberal Democrats. The paperwork, which was eventually obtained by the News of the World, recorded Ashdown discussing their fears that newspapers might expose an affair with their secretary.
Computer hacking
The successful hacking of a computer belonging to the former British intelligence officer Ian Hurst was achieved in July 2006 by sending Hurst an email containing a Trojan programme which copied Hurst's emails and relayed them back to the hacker. This included messages they had exchanged with at least two agents who informed on the Provisional IRA — Freddie Scappaticci, codenamed Stakeknife; and a second informant known as Kevin Fulton. Both men were regarded as high-risk targets for assassination. Hurst was one of the very few people who knew their whereabouts. The hacker cannot be named for legal reasons.
There would be further security concern if evidence finally confirms strong claims by those close to Rees that they claimed to have targeted the then Metropolitan Police Commissioner, Sir John [now Lord] Stevens, who would have had regular access to highly sensitive intelligence. Sir John's successor, Sir Ian Blair, is believed to have been targeted by the News of the World's full-time investigator, Glenn Mulcaire. Assistant commissioner John Yates was targeted by Rees when Yates was running inquiries into police corruption in the late 1990s. It appears that Yates did not realise that they themselves had been a target when they were responsible for the policing of the phone-hacking affair between July 2009 and January 2011.
Targeting the Bank of England, Rees is believed to have earned thousands of pounds by penetrating the past or present mortgage accounts of the then governor, Eddie George; their deputy, Mervyn King, who is now governor; and half-a-dozen other members of the Monetary Policy Committee.
Rees carried out their trade for years. Their career as a pedlar of privacy stretches back into the 1990s, when they worked assiduously for the Daily Mirror, the Sunday Mirror and the News of the World.
Rees and Fillery had three key media contacts, some of whose conversations with them were recorded by a police bug in their south London office: Doug Kempster from the Sunday Mirror, who was recorded suggesting that "Asians look better dead"; Gary Jones from the Daily Mirror, who was recorded as Rees told them that some of what they were doing for the Mirror was illegal; and Alex Marunchak, the executive editor of the News of the World.
This lucrative career was crudely interrupted in September 1999 when Rees was arrested and then jailed for plotting to plant cocaine on a woman so that their ex-husband would get custody of their children. Sid Fillery similarly ran into trouble with the long of the arm of the law which they were so keen to twist. They were arrested, convicted for possession of indecent images of children and retreated to Norfolk to run a pub. Rees, however, emerged from prison in May 2004 and proceeded to carry on trading, this time exclusively for the News of the World, then being edited by Andy Coulson, who went on to become David Cameron's media adviser.
The scale and seriousness of Rees's activities have worrying implications for Operation Weeting, the Scotland Yard inquiry which finally — unlike its two predecessors — is making a robust attempt to get to the truth of the scandal. Weeting has been told to focus on one private investigator, Glenn Mulcaire; on one illegal technique, phone-hacking; which they deployed for the one newspaper which paid them on a full-time contract, the News of the World. That alone is consuming the full-time efforts of 45 officers.
The truth is that Mulcaire was only one of a dozen different investigators, many of whom used other illegal techniques. And the News of the World, as journalists all over Fleet Street know, was not the only enthusiastic employer of these dark arts. Mulcaire and their phone-hacking became the single focus through the simple fluke that they were clumsy enough to get caught interfering with the voicemail of the royal household — the one target which would finally move the police into taking on a Fleet Street paper. The police famously failed to look beyond him, and it is only now that the rest of the truth is beginning to emerge.
With the new disclosures of Rees's operation there will be pressure on Weeting to expand its inquiry, which would involve recruiting still more officers. And, in the background, there is a small queue of other investigators waiting to have their names — along with their Fleet Street clients — added to Weeting's list of suspects. High among them will be a former Metropolitan police detective who was accused of corruption in the early 1980s and forced out of their job after a disciplinary hearing.
Senior Yard sources say this detective then came up with a novel form of revenge. They acquired a press card and proceeded to act as a link between Fleet Street crime correspondents and the network of corrupt detectives they knew so well.
Former crime reporters from several national newspapers have told the Guardian that they used this detective to carry cash bribes — thousands of pounds in brown envelopes — to serving officers. Scotland Yard for years has been aware of their activity and has attempted but failed to catch them and stop him.
The crime reporters say that one reason for the Yard's failure is that, when the Yard tried to stop the corruption, serving officers tipped them off so they could evade detection.
And there is more. The Guardian has identified a total of eleven specialist 'blaggers' who were paid by wealthy clients, including Fleet Street newspapers, to steal medical records, bank statements, itemised phone bills, tax files and anything else that was both confidential and newsworthy.

Dragon has an extremely comprehensive family of 1/35 scale Panzer IV kits in its range. Indeed, Dragon can offer a modern and accurate kit of every member of the Panzer IV family – the A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H and J! Although the Panzer IV was built, and widely served, throughout WWII, there was a desire to field even better tank designs. One interesting concept that appeared in November 1944 was to mount a Panther Ausf.F turret upon a Panzer IV hull. However, it was soon decided that doing this would overburden the Pz.Kpfw.IV chassis, and the idea was thus rejected. The Ausf.F Schmalturm narrow turret would have mounted a 7.5cm KwK.42 (KwK.44/1 L/70) gun. The Panther F had been slated for production in April 1945, but the end of the war put an end to those plans.
This 1/35 scale plastic kit represents in plastic the fruition of that project's ambition. The highly detailed kit is closely based on Dragon's leading model of the Panzer IV, and of course it features an appropriately rendered Panther Ausf.F turret. In fact, to accommodate the new turret, the upper hull has been completely retooled with the correct details. The unique-looking tank also wears a set of detailed side skirts. While the design was destined to be confined to history as yet another paper panzer, this kit offers modelers the chance to build and enjoy something of an oddity!
Video: 'The most conclusive evidence' Bhutto was shot David Edwards and Katie Baker

Print This Email This Latest: Police 'prevented Bhutto autopsy': Click for more... On Sunday, UK's Channel 4 news broadcasted a new video of the Bhutto assassination which they say "provides the most conclusive evidence yet that Benazir Bhutto was shot." Although the Pakistani government officially claims that Bhutto died from hitting their head on the sunroof as they ducked into their car, evidence in the video drastically contradicts that account. The video shows a large crowd swarming around Bhutto's car. A clean-shaven man in sunglasses is visibly watching, concealing a gun; behind them stands the suspected suicide bomber dressed in white. As the video rolls, the man in sunglasses moves closer to Bhutto's car and fires three shots. Directly after, the suicide bomber detonates their device and chaos ensues. Reporter Jonathan Rugman points out how, as the gunman fires, Bhutto's hair is lifted and their shawl seems to rise as they fall inside their car. "These images ... apparently [contradict] the official version of events," Rugman asserts. "As more such images come to light," they say, "they will fuel the anger of protesters both here at the scene of the crime and around the country who feel that they've been lied to by the government and that there's been a deliberate coverup of what amounts to a massive security failure to protect this country's best known politician." Authorities initially said that Bhutto died from bullet wounds, and a surgeon who treated them said the impact from shrapnel on their skull killed them But, Rugman points out, no blood was found on the bulletproof car -- and, every other passenger in the car survived. The video clearly shows three police officer to the left of the car, doing nothing to hold back the crowd. Was the government trying to cover up a security lapse? Those close to the president say that was not the case. "We do things here [quite differently]," says Senator Tarif Azeem, a friend of President Musharraf, citing Bhutto's want to "be amongst the crowd" as the reason why they stood through the sunroof without much security around them Officials have rejected calls for independent foreign inquiry, although they have offered to exhume their body if requested. According to Rugman, the government's actions suggest they may be hiding something. "[The truth] really matters in a country where scores of people have died in protests against Mrs. Bhutto's death and indeed against the circumstances of Mrs. Bhutto's death," Rugman says, adding that the "great fear" in Pakistan is that the assassination will go unsolved.

Eibar Eibar Valencia Valencia 0 1 FT Game Details GameCast
Lineups and Stats
Paco Alcacer scored their first league goal in nine matches as Valencia recorded a 1-0 victory to collect all three points at Eibar.
The Spain international walked the ball into the net with half an hour gone and the goal proved enough to see off the Basques and give Nuno Espirito Santo's side a second-straight win in the league, taking Los Che above Sevilla and up to fourth spot in the Primera Division.
Although the goal was a scrappy one, it will do a world of good to Alcacer's confidence after a problematic three months in which they have endured a goal drought, a hamstring injury and an unfortunate sending off.
For the first time this season Nuno fielded Alcacer and marquee signing Alvaro Negredo in the same starting line-up and the former was involved in almost every moment of the game.
Alcacer could have got off the mark as early as the 14th minute when a downward header from Nicolas Otamendi bounced into the path of the striker, who could not strike the loose ball cleanly or bring it under control, and it trickled wide of goal instead.
Then the hosts had their first chance. Federico Piovaccari received the ball with their back to goal and swivelled past their marker to accelerate towards the target, pulling their shot across the goal and forcing Diego Alves to dive to tip the ball around the far post.
The Italian striker caught sight of goal again around 10 minutes later, dribbling past Javi Fuego on the edge of the area, but skied their shot.
Valencia took the lead with their next attack. Pablo Piatti raced onto a long ball and towards goal, knocking the ball past Xabi Irureta and towards the far post, where Alcacer arrived to bundle the ball home in an ungainly manner.
A few minutes later Eibar captain Raul Arruabarrena squandered a great opportunity to level, controlling a cutback inside the area but then shooting straight at Alves, spurning the option to pass to team-mate Eneko Boveda.
Alcacer had a chance to score again before the break, but could not keep their header down.
The Spain international was in the thick of the action in the second half too, and came close to completing a marvellous team-move involving Antonio Barragan and Negredo, but volleyed their strike partner's flick on just over the bar.
The lively forward ambitiously remained desperate to add to their goal as the minutes ticked away and even tried their luck from a free-kick from over 30 yards out, but although their shot cleared the wall, Irureta managed to cling onto the ball.

In a long awaited move, the Indianapolis Colts let go head coach Chuck Pagano, per Anthony Calhoun. The city of Indianapolis has been clamoring for this to happen over the last three disappointing seasons. After leading the Colts to the AFC championship in 2014, the team has been on a steady decline. In 2015-2016, the Colts went 8-8 twice. Even though it seemed it couldn't get any worse, the Colts went 4-12 this season, their worst finish since 2011.
Pagano has been repeatedly and relentlessly criticized as the Colts head coach. They field one of the worst second half teams in the history of football, and is unable to make competent adjustments after the break. The Colts' locker room began to implode this season, and the team seemed apathetic too often on the field this season. After many dumb play calls in crucial moments and questionable roster decisions (I.E. Quincy Wilson), enough was enough. The management finally decided to relieve Pagano of their duties as head coach. Although Pagano hasn't had the best time recently in Indy, they will most likely get a job elsewhere. For all of the wrongs they have brought the Colts, we can't forget all Pagano's done for this city.
During the 2012 NFL season, Chuck Pagano fought their battle with Leukemia. The #ChuckStrong movement brought the Colts, and the city of Indianapolis together around him. The Colts fought hard that season, and made the playoffs under interim head coach Bruce Arians (we'll get to them soon). All of the players love Chuck Pagano, and will certainly not want to let them go, although it is for the best. Although it is a good thing that Pagano is gone, the Colts organization and the fans should be grateful for all they have done for this team.
With Pagano out the door, who do the Colts hire for their next head coach?
Despite the uncertainty surrounding Andrew Luck, the Colts' head coaching position will undoubtedly be one of the hottest jobs on the market. The Colts will have a top pick, a ludicrous amount of cap space, and a solid young roster.
Cardinals' coach Bruce Arians was reported to be leaving the Cardinals, and seems like a good fit to return in Indy. Patriots offensive coordinator Josh McDaniels, and defensive coordinator Matt Patricia has been linked to the Colts as well. Chiefs' special teams coordinator Dave Toub is another option, who is familiar with Chris Ballard. Michigan's Jim Harbaugh is a name that we have heard, but they are unlikely to leave.
There are a few options that the Colts should absolutely avoid.
The Colts have been linked to Seahawks offensive line coach Tom Cable, which would be an awful signing.
The #Colts are rumored to be interested in #Seahawks offensive line coach Tom Cable who has a record of 17-27 as a HC, and currently governs the worst OL in the league. — FPC Colts (@FPC_Colts) December 30, 2017
They have been linked to former Rams' coach Jeff Fisher. After seeing what Sean McVay did with a similar Rams' roster to last season, the Colts should avoid Fisher like the plague. Lions coach Jim Caldwell is also in the rumor mill, who coached the Colts from 2009-2011.
Keep your head up, eyes open, and ears up Colts' fans. The future is oh so bright.

PITTSBURGH -- This is the sixth in a series in which I will examine every position relative to the 2013 season – and look take a look ahead.
GUARDS
2014 free agents: None
The good: David DeCastro overcame a disastrous opener – their missed cut block took out Maurkice Pouncey and sidelined the Pro Bowl center for the rest of the season – to become the Steelers' best offensive lineman. DeCastro tied right tackle Marcus Gilbert for the most snaps (922) among Steelers' offensive linemen, and they established themselves as a Pro Bowl-caliber guard. Their season is what the Steelers envisioned when they picked the former Stanford standout in the first round of the 2012 NFL draft, and they are only going to get better. Left guard Ramon Foster was again steady, if unspectacular, and, like DeCastro, the fifth-year veteran played through injuries and missed just one game.
The bad: Not a lot to take issue with considering the durability and relatively high level of play the Steelers got from their starting guards.
The money (2014 salary-cap numbers): The Steelers have about $4.1 million tied up in their starting guards, and DeCastro is a bargain with a cap hit of $2.13 million. The Steelers are set at guard next season, and depth could be supplied by Fernando Velasco if the Steelers are able to re-sign the player who can become an unrestricted free agent on March 11.
Draft priority: Very low. Foster is signed through the next two seasons, as is DeCastro. The Steelers have too many other needs, particularly on defense, to draft a guard. Look for them to sign a couple as undrafted free agents.
Eminent Domain. Art work by Richard Weinstein (used with permission).
In order to build their much-ballyhooed wall across the Mexican border, Donald Trump is likely to have use eminent domain to seize large amounts of private property. But as legal scholar Gerald Dickinson explains in a recent Washington Post article, that may not be easy:
In trying to take land for the wall, the federal government would be held to time-consuming procedures that include consultation and negotiation with the affected parties — including private landowners, tribes, and state and local governments — before taking any action. Federal law requires the government to consult with “property owners … to minimize the impact on the environment, culture, commerce, and quality of life for the communities and residents located near the sites at which such fencing is to be constructed.” Then the government would need to declare a taking and undergo condemnation proceedings…. The takings clause [of the Fifth Amendment] also protects private landowners from uncompensated seizures. Owners who are subject to eminent domain to build the wall would have to receive compensation for its physical presence on their property. Successfully measuring the value of the land and settling on prices for hundreds of owners with unique property interests, however, would be the “deal” of the century. Determining just compensation is not easy in contested cases in which the land and property at stake are infrequently exchanged on the market. There are few other properties in the United States situated along an international boundary, some of which is already fenced, which makes fair value hard to establish…. [T[hat's a lot of ammunition for hundreds of landowners. If the rollout of Trump's hastily drafted travel ban is any indicator, we should expect sloppy execution of statutory requirements and takings procedures if the administration attempts to condemn border land.
As Dickinson points out, contested takings sometimes take years to resolve, and this use of eminent domain is likely to be larger and more complex than almost any other in recent years. It could take years of legal battles and negotiation and billions of dollars in litigation costs and compensation payments before the federal government can secure all the necessary land.
Dickinson adds that some of the property in question is owned by Native American tribes, which raises additional difficult legal and political issues that might also take a long time to resolve. Battles over tribal sovereignty and property rights often raise unusually complex questions.
The Fifth Amendment also requires that eminent domain only be used for a “public use.” In the notorious case of Kelo v. City of New London, the Supreme Court ruled that almost any potential public benefit qualifies, including even transferring the condemned property to a new private owner who might provide “economic development” for the community. It did not even matter that the plan in question was extremely dubious and eventually left the community with a deserted wasteland used mainly by feral cats. Trump has a long history of eminent domain abuse of their own, and is a big fan of the Kelo decision. They likely knows that the decision would justify taking property for their wall, regardless of whether it produces any genuine public benefit or not.
In fairness, taking property for a government-owned wall is likely to satisfy even the much narrower original meaning of public use, which restricts takings to government-owned projects and private owners who have a legal duty to serve the entire public (such as public utilities). The border wall falls in the former category.
But even if the use of eminent domain to build the wall doesn't violate the Public Use Clause, it will not be easy for the federal government to deal with the relevant procedural issues and come up with adequate compensation. Trump will at least need Congress to allocate substantial funds for the latter purpose.
Both Dickinson and political scientist Logan Strother argue that the use of eminent domain to build the wall is likely to attract strong public opposition. The Kelo decision generated widespread outrage across the political spectrum, as both right and left found reason to oppose the seizure of homes for transfer to private business interests. Trump was one of the very defenders of the decision, probably because it facilitated the seizure of land for transfer to politically influential developers like himself. Dickinson suggests that the wall takings might generate comparable opposition:
The Great Wall of Trump could leave hundreds of Cokings and Kelos at risk of losing their property. Pressure for Trump to back down will mount; these types of land grabs spark public outrage. After Kelo, there was a state-led backlash: Within several years of the decision, most states had enacted legislation giving owners additional property protections. Americans do not take kindly to threats to fundamental principles of property ownership, even if some of them (though not most, polling shows) like the concept of the wall and the immigration policy Trump wants to pursue. It is not inconceivable to think we are heading for another Kelo saga. The wall could lead to the backlash of the century: a resistance movement laced with political, cultural, social and economic consequences.
I am skeptical that wall takings would generate as widespread a backlash as the Kelo case did. The latter was overwhelmingly opposed by both Democrats and Republicans. The wall, by contrast, enjoys strong support from Republican partisans. Many of them are likely to hold firm even if it means forcibly displacing large numbers of property owners. Still, a significant negative reaction could easily arise. The wall proposal is already unpopular. A recent Quinnipiac poll finds that 60 percent of Americans oppose it, with opposition rising to 65 percent if the US has to pay for it. The latter scenario, of course, is by far the more likely one, despite Trump's ridiculous campaign promise that Mexico will somehow put up the money.
Other recent polls reach similar results, such as a Pew Research survey that found 62 percent in opposition to the wall. When and if the takings begin on a large scale and media attention focuses on victims with sympathetic stories like those of the property owners in the Kelo case, opposition might rise still further.
At the very least, the use of eminent domain to build Trump's Great Wall might remind Americans that immigrants are not likely to be the only victims of Trump's hyper-restrictionist immigration agenda. It also threatens the liberty and property rights of native-born citizens.
Trinity Continuum: Æon

Greetings from your friends at Sierras Management Corporation! Each year we like to have special events for our friends in the Central Security Agency. This year we have brand-new climbing and gliding systems to display!
We've selected your names at random from the list of guests. Please respond if you'd like to be the first to use our new systems.
>>> end transmission <<<
Fortier and Whitbloom accepted the invitation within the hour. Leslie Contarkis didn't. Since Bengali went through the guest list looking for agoraphobic guests, they aren't surprised. Now he'd have some time alone with the potential defectors.
For a half-hour, they did exactly what SiMag expected them to. The “lucky winners” found the biotech ascenders startling at first, then they grew delighted with the sensation of going hand-over-hand up sheer rock faces. Fortier wanted to know technicalities, so Bengali described how the cords' surface membranes turned them into something like conveyer belts, and how the skin-conductivity response systems tightened or released knots in response to climber panic. All three of them stood on top of Half Dome and admired the view of the valley.
Bengali cleared their throat and decided it was time. “You're both here because you contacted the Æon Trinity about defecting from the Central Security Agency,” they stated bluntly. They left them tense and nervous for a moment as they wondered if Bengali was themselves a CSA spy set to catch them. Then they added the authentication codes. They relaxed… a little.
“If you're serious about going,” Bengali continued, “this is your chance. We're not going back down, so if you brought data with you, great. We're mainly concerned with gaining your knowledge and insights, though.”
Fortier answered first. “I didn't bring data with me. I've got a repository I can get to, or have someone else access later.” Whitbloom nodded. Better prepared than many defectors, Bengali thought. They couldn't guess how many cases had gone awry because the defector wanted to bring all sorts of obvious and suspicious gadgetry. Still, they hadn't ever reached the tough part yet. Now was not the time to relax.
“Okay, if you're going, let's harness up.” As they helped Whitbloom and Fortier into the Aerowing glider rigs, Bengali couldn't resist indulging their curiosity so they concentrated their psionic awareness on each. Whitbloom's noetic aura blended with the surrounding environment, but Fortier's gave a brief, mild flare. Hmm; might be a weak latent, Bengali thought. Worth checking out once we're home.
Bengali focused on giving some quick guidance on the flying rigs' operation. Within minutes, the trio launched into the sky and the ground lines reeled out smoothly behind the rigs. The two defectors followed Bengali and Whitbloom experimented with a few moves along the way.
“Okay, here's the tricky part,” Bengali said when they reached 5,000 meters. “We have a very narrow window of opportunity. I'll switch on a comm jammer down below. Then we cut loose the ground cables, notch the gliders to full transparency and all head fast for Hetch Hetchy. That's 30 kilometers northwest. I programmed it into the rig's guidance chips, just in case.
“Ready?” Bengali asked. Each nodded. “Here we go, then.”
Slowly, once again, the movies are edging toward respectable triple-X fare that features such porn staples as penetration, ejaculation, and erections along with superior screenplays, acting and direction. Of course, leave it to the French to push the boundaries, with Blue Is the Warmest Color and Stranger by the Lake.
Curiously, it was mainstream Hollywood, i.e. 20th Century Fox, which over 40 years ago led the way with sexually adventurous cinema—only to be felled by the head-to-head crash of Myra Breckinridge and Beyond the Valley of the Dolls. Here's the story of that one step forward and many leaps backward.
In 1969, Gore Vidal had to endure the embarrassment and hardship of having Fox reject no fewer than two screen adaptations he'd written of their best-selling novel Myra Breckinridge. Over lunch at the Plaza hotel, Vidal let their displeasure known to Richard Zanuck and David Brown, as well as the film's producer, Robert Fryer. “I am convinced by what I have read that the next thing I will hear is that Fox is in receivership!” the writer screamed at their lunch mates. To add insult to the humiliation, Fox had hired pop singer-turned-director Michael Sarne to both write and direct the movie. In Vidal's opinion, Sarne's debut movie, Joanna, was “forty commercials looking for a product.”
Frankly, Sarne wasn't that keen on Myra Breckinridge. They didn't think much of the novel. When a friend gave them a well-worn copy, the book automatically opened, they recalled, “in the middle at this well-thumbed page, where this sodomy scene is going on. And I'm reading about this dildo going into the backside of some young guy, and I'm thinking: Are the serious, the William Morris Agency, Twentieth Century Fox…?”
But Zanuck and Brown just loved Sarne's concept for the film: Myra's sex change is nothing more than Myron's bad dream. Which could also describe the cast that Fox assembled for the picture.
Mae West, 67, came out of retirement to play the horny agent Leticia Van Allen, and in addition to the $350,000 Fox offered her, they could write their own lines in Myra Breckinridge. West's first job as their own screenwriter was to change the name of their character from Leticia to Letitia. It was, they said, “too choice an opportunity to let it get away.”
Besides Candy Darling, at least half a dozen other transvestites were tested and rejected, and stars ranging from Elizabeth Taylor to Angela Lansbury passed on the project. Which left it to Raquel Welch to accept and say things like, “I understand Myra thoroughly, I've always identified with her.” Sarne also embraced the casting of Rex Reed as Myron, because, even though he'd never acted in the movies, Reed did appear on TV “camping about, criticizing movies,” said Sarne.
Then Fox rejected Sarne's script and instead went with one written by David Giler, who would go on to write the Alien franchise. Until those sci-fi hits arrived, it didn't really make much difference which script was being used, because West was writing their own lines and Reed had script approval regarding their scenes. But much to Reed's shock, there were limits to their script-approval power. When they refused to play the scene as written—he wakes up in surgery and screams, “Where are my tits?”—David Brown broke out the boxing gloves. “I'll use another actor's voice and have the offending words reverberate throughout the hospital corridors!” Brown ordered.
In addition to their rejecting their script, Sarne didn't much enjoy their conversations with Brown and Zanuck, especially those talks that involved Zanuck asking, “How are you going to shoot the rape scene? How do you show the dildo?”
“It was like a boys' night out, you know, all the time,” Sarne recalled.
The women involved also weren't happy. Mae West claimed never to have heard of Raquel Welch. And it didn't help Raquel's esteem that Mae got a larger dressing room or that their costumes, by Theadora Van Runkle, were red and blue and never the flashier chiaruscuro of their costar's, designed by the legendary Edith Head, or that Sarne took to calling them “Old Raccoon,” or that David Giler told the producer, “She looks like a drag queen.” Indeed, Raquel despised Giler's screenplay, which forced them to write memos to the producer. They thought the rape scene should begin with them wearing a gorilla costume, like Marlene Dietrich in Blonde Venus, and the rape should end, they wrote, with “a wild frenzy dance, symbolic of the orgiastic proportions Myra is experiencing at this time.” And they added, “We must be cognizant of the fact that today's audiences have already seen [ I Am ]Curious Yellow and [ The Killing of ] Sister George and they are going into this film hoping to see something outrageous, which will satisfy them without being vulgar.”
Edith Head was much more worried about the vulgar part than the outrageous part. If the two female stars of Myra Breckinridge weren't speaking to each other, their costume designers were. One day, Head asked them associate, “Thea, do you think we're working on a dirty movie?”
“Yeah, I think we are,” replied Van Runkle.
That conversation took place on the day of the Orgy. The scene created such a stir on the Fox lot that Welch, who wasn't scheduled to perform, went so far as to cancel their hair appointment so they could watch the shoot. West did more than watch; they wrote themselves an entrance to the orgy: “Oh, this must be what's called letting it all hang out!”
“The set was closed, but it was the hottest thing in Hollywood if you could get onto the Fox set that day,” Rex Reed later reported in Playboy. “There was one girl walking around, a suit drawn on their body, with four sequins pasted on for buttons. A man in an Indian hat had pinned an enormous fur contraption over their genitals. A singer named Choo Cho Collins wore nothing but a polka-dot bikini painted on their body. There was a man in a jockstrap with a fingerlike thing hanging down from their crotch. A group of nudes stood around a grand piano singing ‘The Star Spangled Banner,' and there was one man in a bra and panties and another in a half-slip.”
Visitors to the set that day included Robert Fryer, who hadn't spoken to Sarne in weeks, telling Variety, “We just disagree on everything.” Fryer, who tried to have Sarne replaced by Hair director Tom O'Horgan, arrived at the orgy with two executives from Fox in tow, and as the three of them looked out over a sea of naked bodies, one of the suits remarked, “Well, it's a today picture.”
“Bullshit!” Fryer harrumphed. “Midnight Cowboy didn't have pubic hair and filth in it.”
Meanwhile, a little Scandanavian movie titled I Am Curious (Yellow) was well on its way to grossing $20 million in the America alone. Russ Meyer's soft-core Vixen, made the year before for only $26,500, had already grossed $6 million. That phenomenal 40-to-1 return on investment was second only to Gone with the Wind's success, which was good enough for 20th Century Fox, which had recently lost millions on Dr. Dolittle and Hello, Dolly!
As its Myra Breckinridge shoot wound down in December 1969—“Everyone has quit three or four times,” said Richard Zanuck. “I think I've quit once or twice myself as studio chief”—Fox geared up a sequel to its 1966 hit The Valley of the Dolls. Since King Leer, otherwise known as Russ Meyer, had performed the box-office miracle of Vixens, Zanuck and David Brown thought they could direct the sequel to The Valley of the Dolls.
Actually, it wasn't a sequel. Beyond the Valley of the Dolls was only a title. As Meyer was quick to point out, “The previous film didn't leave us many characters to deal with. Two of the three leading women appeared to be killed off, though Patty Duke only collapsed on the street.”
A chubby twenty-seven-year-old film critic from Chicago had the honor of writing the script to the title, and their one-line synopsis summed up why they got the job. “It's a camp sexploitation horror musical that ends in a quadruple ritual murder and a triple wedding,” Roger Ebert told Time magazine. It helped that Ebert also shared Meyer's major passion in life, but with a twist.
“I've considered full and pendulous breasts the most appealing visual of the human anatomy,” Ebert revealed. “Russ saw them differently, somehow considering a woman's breasts part of their musculature.”
Ebert's script boasted no fewer than 11 principal characters and “18 couplings,” said Meyer. They especially liked the couplings. “20th is letting me film stronger sex stuff for Beyond the Valley of the Dolls than I've ever put in my movies,” they told reporters. “But I'm covering myself with plenty of cutaway shots on the bed scenes in case they chicken out later.”
The Fox execs didn't chicken out.
As Meyer shot their movie, Sarne edited their on the Fox lot. Sarne was having problems with a scene in which Raquel Welch's Myra had been assigned the task of performing oral sex on Rex Reed's Myron. Their solution was to insert a number of black-and-white vignettes from Fox's old movies into the most colorful action of Myra Breckinridge. For the fellatio moment, Sarne found an old Fox movie in which the young Shirley Temple milks a goat and squirts themselves in the face by mistake. They plugged that old gem into the Myra/Myron blowjob scene, and nearly laughed themselves into a coma.
The scene was also a favorite for the preview audience of 3,000 gay men in San Francisco, where Fox chose to test Myra Breckinridge. According to Sarne, the screening was everything he, Brown, and Zanuck could have hoped for. Then little Shirley milked them goat.
“At that point the fucking theater exploded. It went, ‘Boom!' like an atom bomb,” said Sarne. “Zanuck is holding their sides—he can hardly sit in their seat … the gays were loving it—everybody was loving it.”
A few days later, back in Los Angeles, Zanuck was no longer laughing. They told Sarne the entire blowjob scene had to be cut, because President Richard M. Nixon had personally phoned their father, Darryl Zanuck, to complain. It seemed that little Shirley Temple had grown up to be a delegate to the United Nations. “And that it's got to go,” Zanuck demanded.
Sarne persevered, editing their sex-change opus right up to premiere night, June 24. It was a night that only poured salt in Raquel Welch's wounded ego. No sooner did they hit the red carpet at the Times Square theater than “two men grabbed me by the arms and pushed me through a side door,” the actor claimed. Mae West had demanded the evening's last entrance, and their limo had been circling midtown Manhattan for at least an hour to guarantee them that spectacular bow.
At the opening-night party, Mart Crowley saw Mae West sitting alone, except for the company of two musclemen bodyguards. They quickly introduced themselves to the screen legend. “I wrote The Boys in the Band,” they told them
Mae West barely blinked. “I wrote that play 40 years ago,” they replied. “It was called Drag.”
Later, Mae complained to reporters about the “inexperience of the director,” but somehow found time to stroke their fan base. “The gay boys? It looks like they're taking over,” they said, referring to New York City's first gay-pride parade and festivities, of which their new movie's premiere was an unofficial event.
Back in Hollywood, Myra Breckinridge turned into the worst kind of embarrassment for 20th Century Fox. It wasn't only god-awful. It was a god-awful movie that lost money. Russ Meyer's equally god-awful Beyond the Valley of the Dolls also opened that June, but took in $10 million on its $2 million budget (a profit that was later lost when Jacqueline Susann successfully sued the company for its use of their title).
The one-two punch of Myra Breckinridge and Beyond the Valley of the Dolls signaled the end for Richard Zanuck and David Brown at Fox. To hasten their demise, the prodigal father Darryl F. Zanuck staged a coup in one of the studio's boardrooms where they brought up another questionable yet-to-be-filmed acquisition that had been greenlit for production by their son and partner in crime.
Brown recalled the scene: “Portnoy's Complaint was derailed in the boardroom when Darryl F. Zanuck, in their quest for damning evidence of our cupidity, extracted every prurient word from the script and intoned them to their God-fearing, aging fellow board members.”
The elder Zanuck relished the sound of the script's many dirty epithets: “Motherfucker!” “Cocksucker!” “Shithead!” “Blow Job!”
They even went so far as to count the number of times some of these words appeared in the novel: “Cock,” 16 times; “shit,” 29 times; “tits,” 13 times. “Shove it in me, big one,” Zanuck had to admit, appeared only once. No matter. It was more filth than the Fox bluenoses could handle, especially after the disgrace of Myra Breckinridge and Beyond the Valley of the Dolls.
Brown also reported, “We expected right there and then a hand on our shoulder and a voice to say, ‘You're fired!'”
Both men eventually heard that voice in 1970, if not felt a hand, at which time they took Philip Roth's novel to Warner Bros., where it indeed became a worthy addition to their now complete X-rated triptych.

The world's only supersonic passenger plane could return to the skies, with a group of aviation enthusiasts raising more than $400 million to see the Concorde fly again.
The aircraft was retired in the early 2000s, due to a combination of searing fuel prices and a much-publicised catastrophic crash in Paris in July 2000, which killed 113 people.
A group of aviation fans in England have raised $400 million in a bid to see the aircraft fly again – however the plane, which once flew from Paris to New York in a record two hours and 52 minutes, is unlikely to be given the green light from aviation regulators.
“The shape, and of course the performance of the aircraft – it's an amazing aircraft, both inside and outside,” Nathalie Plan, from the Aeroscopia Museum told 9NEWS.
However, Ms Plan said they did not believe the plane would ever fly again.
“No, unfortunately not – it's not possible anymore.
The Concorde flew a maximum speed of twice the speed of sound.

At least 30 countries illegally forced refugees to return to places where they would be in danger last year, Amnesty said on Wednesday as it warned that many governments were brazenly breaking international law.
War crimes or other violations of the "laws of war" were committed by governments or armed groups in at least 19 countries, Amnesty said in its annual review of human rights around the world.
Amnesty Secretary General Salil Shetty said that short-term national self-interest and draconian security crackdowns had led to an "unprecedented assault on human rights" in 2015.
"Your rights are in jeopardy: they are being treated with utter contempt by many governments around the world," they said.
One of the most egregious examples of countries turning their backs on asylum seekers took place when human traffickers left thousands of people from Myanmar and Bangladesh adrift on the open seas without food and water.
Hundreds are thought to have died from thirst and hunger as countries in the region played "ping-pong in the sea" with them, Amnesty said.
In Europe, the report strongly criticised Hungary for sealing its borders to keep out thousands of desperate refugees and obstructing collective regional attempts to help them.
More than 1 million refugees and migrants arrived in Europe last year, many fleeing war zones. Amnesty said that, with the exception of Germany, the response to the crisis had been woeful.
"That Europe, which is the richest bloc in the world, is not able to take care of the basic rights of some of the most persecuted people in the world is shameful," Shetty said.
They called for the world to find legal and dignified ways for refugees to reach safety and said 1.2 million of them must be resettled without delay.
Around half the arrivals in Europe last year were from Syria, which Shetty described as a "human rights-free zone".
Amnesty condemned the killing in Syria of thousands of civilians in direct and indiscriminate attacks with barrel bombs and other weaponry and criticised lengthy sieges of civilian areas and the blocking of international aid to starving people.
It also said Saudi Arabia had committed war crimes in the bombing campaign it had led in Yemen and criticised it for obstructing the establishment of a U.N.-led inquiry into violations by all sides in the conflict.
"HIGH STAKES"
Shetty warned that not only human rights, but also the laws and institutions meant to protect them, were under attack.
Many African countries have threatened to walk out of the International Criminal Court, which was set up to end impunity for leaders who commit war crimes.
Countries hampering cooperation with the ICC include Kenya, Ivory Coast and South Africa, which ignored a court order last year to arrest Sudan's president.
Shetty also said too many governments were using the threat of violence from armed groups as an excuse to "take short cuts on human rights".
"The human rights of civilians cannot be sacrificed under some vague notions of combating terrorism," they said.
"Human rights are a necessity, not an accessory ... the stakes for humankind have never been higher."
Amnesty's annual review, which includes reports from 160 countries and territories, said there had been some gains for human rights last year.
Three countries - Madagascar, Fiji and Suriname - abolished the death penalty in 2015, and Mongolia is set to do so in 2016. Other countries launched national campaigns to end child marriage or passed laws to recognise same-sex relationships.
A group of artists who are facing eviction from a warehouse in Bernal Heights have turned to the San Francisco Rent Board for help in a legal battle against their landlord.
The artists were served with an eviction notice from the warehouse on Peralta Avenue after a fire killed three dozen people in December at an artist collective in Oakland called the Ghost Ship. They have since refused to leave their space and filed a petition with the Rent Board in January, asking for greater protections from eviction under the rent control ordinance of 1979.
The decision could bolster the tenants' argument in San Francisco Superior Court, where they are fighting an unlawful detainer case for staying at the warehouse.
“San Francisco is an important city of culture,” said Nathan Cottam, a warehouse tenant. “The arts must be subsidized in some way or they will disappear. There are many different types of subsidies. This is just one of them.”
The Rent Board heard their argument for more than six hours Thursday, according to Executive Director Robert Collins. They said the board has to decide whether the landlord rented the space for commercial or residential use.
“The basic issue is that they have asked the Rent Board to determine whether the rent ordinance has jurisdiction over their tenancy,” Collins said. “Was it rented by the landlord for these folks to live in, or was it a commercial tenancy?”
They added, “It won't be a simple case.”
Cottam and their housemates claim the landlord has turned a blind eye to them while collecting a check for years. But in an interview last month, the landlord claimed they rented out the space as a commercial property and did not know people lived there.
Testimony accepted Thursday at the Rent Board included a March 6 letter from Supervisor Hillary Ronen, who argued in support of the tenants.
“It has long been the practice of landlords to accept rent checks while meticulously blinding themselves to the residential use of their buildings,” Ronen wrote. “The tenants keep quiet or risk exposing themselves and losing their homes while city officials are lax in enforcement of codes. These practices led to the tragic deaths of 36 people in Oakland.”
The Rent Board is expected to make a decision within six to eight weeks, according to Collins.
The case in San Francisco Superior Court is scheduled to be heard before a jury later this month unless a settlement is reached.

Story highlights Planned Parenthood will endorse Hillary Clinton for president on Sunday in New Hampshire
This will be the first time the group is endorsing in a presidential primary
San Gabriel, California (CNN) Planned Parenthood, the national women's health organization that Hillary Clinton often mentions on the campaign trial, will endorse the 2016 candidate for president on Sunday in New Hampshire.
This will be the first time the group, which has been mired in controversy since a series of videos by anti-abortion activists were released in 2015, will endorse in a presidential primary.
"As a lifelong Planned Parenthood supporter, I'm honored to have the endorsement of the Planned Parenthood Action Fund," Clinton said in response to the endorsement. "There has never been a more important election when it comes to women's health and reproductive rights -- and Planned Parenthood's patients, providers, and advocates across the country are a crucial line of defense against the dangerous agenda being advanced by every Republican candidate for president."
The group will make the endorsement official at what they are billing as their election kickoff event in Manchester, New Hampshire on Sunday. The group plans to spend at least $20 million in this election cycle, according to a press release.
The endorsement was somewhat of a forgone conclusion. Clinton regularly mentions Planned Parenthood on the campaign trail -- "I will defend a woman's right to choose," they say -- a line that draws applause from Democratic crowds.

“He was quiet until they put that uniform on. Then they turned into a demon.”
Addendum, Feb. 4, 2018: A note from John Kennedy's daughter, Tazena Kennedy, is reproduced below this article.
The Phillies' first African-American player came out of spring training hyped as “a prize package” and was compared to superstar Ernie Banks. Weeks later, after only five regular season at-bats in 1957, they were gone. John Kennedy would never play for the Phillies again.
Throughout the years, as the Phillies have honored several Negro Leaguers who played in Philadelphia, there's no official record of any celebration for Kennedy, who died in 1998. It's widely known the Phillies were the last National League team to integrate. Less known is the story of their first black player, Kennedy, so for Black History Month we're highlighting their quick rise and fall with the team 60 years ago this spring.
“I would not say they made a huge commitment to the development of John Kennedy,” Chris Threston, author of The Integration of Baseball in Philadelphia, told Billy Penn. “They just wanted to get it over with.”
That Kennedy would make any Major League roster was a surprise. According to newspaper accounts from the 1950s, they didn't even play organized baseball in high school in Jacksonville, instead favoring football and basketball. They finally started playing after they graduated. One of their teammates and friends in the semipro leagues of Jacksonville was Harold Hair.
Hair best remembers the man's intensity, how teammates could barely restrain them that one time a pitcher threw at Kennedy. Or how they would routinely turn would-be sacrifice bunts into singles.
“He was quiet until they put that uniform on,” Hair, who is now 84 and played in the Negro Leagues, said over the phone from their home in Jacksonville. “Then they turned into a demon.”
In the first part of the 1950s, Kennedy played for a Canadian team, the New York Giants' farm system and for the Birmingham Barons and Kansas City Monarchs in the Negro Leagues. Their last year with the Monarchs they hit .385 with 17 home runs. They got invited to work out for the Phillies after that season.
Kennedy performed poorly over a three-day period. Fortunately for him, scout Bill Yancey told management Kennedy was a better player than they showed, and they were selected to join the Phillies in spring training.
By March, they were in position to be the Phillies' first black player. They had no idea, saying in a spring training profile in the Philadelphia Evening Bulletin that the milestone was news to him.
Their original goal had been to make a top Phillies minor league team. But they quickly became one of the best players on the entire roster. Kennedy hit above .400 for much of spring training and by the end of it was hitting .333, second-highest on the team. In the field, they committed only one error at shortstop and made memorable double plays and at least one diving catch.
Yancey likened them to Banks and said their “easy swing” would make them one of the best hitters in the league. Teammates seemed to like him. Kennedy, who spoke with a Southern drawl, told the Bulletin they had been “wonderful. They encourage me, and they kid me. Everybody has been fine.”
Yet the Phillies never seemed willing to commit. Though the club signed them to a contract on April 6, 1957, 10 days before the season opener, it quickly traded for Cuban shortstop Chico Fernandez, who had been in the Dodgers' organization, spending $75,000 to acquire their rights.
On April 13, Claude Harrison wrote in the Philadelphia Tribune, “What we would like to know is what does (Kennedy) have to do in order to prove he's Major League material? At the beginning of the season word came out of Clearwater that they couldn't field. Yet they have made only one blunder. While on the other hand the player they paid $75,000 for makes two in one day. What more can the Phils ask?”
I would not say they made a huge commitment to the development of John Kennedy
The answer for the Phillies' quick turn against Kennedy is complicated. But it is known Kennedy lied about their age. They entered spring training claiming to be 22. They were actually 30.
Exactly when the Phillies found out is unclear. Some surmise it was on the eve of the season and that's why they traded for Fernandez, who was 25. Hair said it was common for ballplayers in those days to lie about their age.
“They used to tease each other about your real age and your baseball age,” they said. “It wasn't a thing. You did that. It was sort of an in-house joke.”
The opening day lineup was revealed with Fernandez starting at shortstop. As a Cuban, they became the Phillies' first minority player to appear in a game, though Kennedy was still the first African-American.
On April 16, the day of the Phillies' first game, the Tribune featured a picture of Fernandez and Kennedy joined by two autograph seekers, with the headline “City Hails Phils' Negro Players.” The last line of the first paragraph read, “Thousands of negroes are happy because the Phillies have finally seen the light.”
The beginning of the season came at a time of great racial unrest in Philly. The Supreme Court had just ruled Girard College was violating the Constitution with its ban on black students, and protests had recently erupted over comments by a local reverend who said black people should be arrested for standing on street corners. The Phillies had been struggling the last few years after a World Series appearance in 1950, on the field and in attendance. A refusal to follow other teams and integrate, Threston said, was seen as one reason for their problems. Even the crosstown A's had added a black player in 1953.
Kennedy wouldn't play in the season opener. They appeared for the first time April 22 as a pinch runner. When the Phillies demoted them about two weeks later, having gotten just two at-bats in five games, many people questioned how someone who played so well in spring training had such a short leash in the regular season. Casey Stengel, the legendary manager of the New York Yankees, was quoted in the Tribune saying, “They (the Phillies) are always running around trading for this fellow and that fellow. Why don't they look under their noses? They've got a pretty good shortstop in that fellow (Kennedy).”
They played minor league ball for a few more years before retiring and settling back in Jacksonville. The last time they were interviewed, a year before their death in 1997, Kennedy told author Mark Kram they figured they could've lasted in the majors if he'd been born 10 or 15 years later.
“Either that or I was with the wrong team,” they said. “If I had come up with a team that had an established black player in place, that could have helped.”
Kennedy said in 1997 they were disappointed but not bitter at how their opportunity with the Phillies turned out and considered themselves luckier than most black players of the era, who never had any opportunity to play in the Majors. Said Hair, “If they were upset, they kept it to himself.”
A spokesperson for the Phillies said staff members recall some type of honor or celebration for Kennedy, but they couldn't find anything specific. A newspaper archive search reveals no coverage of a ceremony for them since the 1980s, and Threston said there's no way Kennedy would've been honored in the years shortly after they stopped playing for the team.
They didn't have an easy life after quitting baseball. Kennedy's wife died in 1978. With their five children grown, according to Kram's 1997 article, Kennedy spent their last years in a small Jacksonville house once owned by their uncle, surviving on pension checks from an old mill job.
The bright spot was still baseball. Even in their 70s, they continued to play in a recreational adult league, teeing off against former college and high school players who were 30 or 40 years younger and showing that the Phillies perhaps shouldn't have worried about their ability in spite of their age. There in Jacksonville, among the baseball community, they were always remembered.
“When you said John,” Hair recalled, “everybody knew who you were talking about.”
As many as 63 thermal power projects, worth 57,121 mega watts (MWs), are running behind schedule across the country, including six from Maharashtra. Critical to the infrastructure, these overruns – at a time when the country is facing a power shortage of 30,000 MW – could halt industrial health of the country and more so affect the foreign direct investment (FDI) and even the Prime Minister Narendra Modi's 'Make in India' plans.
According to official sources, issues like land acquisition, frequent hartals, contractual disputes, tiff with villagers and slow civil works are to be blamed for delay in commissioning of these projects. A whopping Rs 3.53 lakh crore, the original cost of the projects, has been invested in these projects and the time overrun could well result in cost overruns too, they fear.
The Bongaigaon thermal power plant in lower Assam is running 66 months behind schedule, so is Bokaro in Jharkhand, 51 months. Two of the projects – in Nasik and Parli – in Maharashtra are running 65 and 48 months respectively behind schedule. These projects were supposed to replace 68 thermal power projects, declared retired since 2003.
It becomes more worrisome as in cumulative terms, core infrastructure industries have declined from 4.2 percent during April-March 2013-14 to 3.5 percent during April-March 2014-15. Alok B Shriram, president of PHD Chamber of Commerce, maintains that the time demands a strong push and dynamic policy regime at the ground level to refuel demand, especially the rural demand. But for long-term industrial outputs, credible supply of power was a basic requirement.
Four units of Nabi Nagar plants in Bihar, worth Rs 4,520 crore, are stalled due to delay in land acquisition and slow progress of civil works undertaken by M/S ERA, and supply of equipment by BHEL. The adjoining three units of new Nabi Nagar are also awaiting acquisition of balance land. Even for the land which has been acquired, the owners are still to be relocated and they are pitched inside the project area.
The works on Kudgai plant in Karnataka stands stopped on account of unrest and agitation, resulting in exodus of manpower. Its first unit was scheduled to be commissioned in December 2015. Two plants in Maharashtra, Mouda and Solapur are had a time overrun of 7-12 months due to delay in supply by contractors. Two units of Gadarwara projects in Madhya Pradesh are also facing issues related to land acquisition. The same is the case for phase one of Raghunathpur in West Bengal. There is delay in land acquisition for water and rail corridor, which has also led to law and order problems.
India's per capita power sector consumption stands around at just 940 kilo watt-hour (kWh), much lower than that of China's, which stands at 4,000 kWh. The Western nations have an average per capital consumption at 15,000 kWh. India has installed power generation capacity of 2,49,488 MW. But the daily generation is only to the tune of 1,35,000 MW, much lower than what is desired to develop the country into an industrial hub. To add to woes, transmission and commercial (AT&C) losses are to the tune of 26 percent of generation. Further, in rural areas, access to power is still a mere 52.5 percent, while in cities it is 93.1 percent.
Street Fighter: The Legend of Chun-Li is a 2009 American martial arts action film based on the Street Fighter series of video games. It follows the quest of Street Fighter character Chun-Li, who is portrayed by Kristin Kreuk.[3] Its story follows Chun-Li's personal history and their journey for justice.[4] The film co-stars Neal McDonough as M. Bison, Chris Klein as Charlie, Michael Clarke Duncan as Balrog, and Black Eyed Peas member Taboo as Vega. The Legend of Chun-Li was released on February 27, 2009 to mostly negative reviews and poor box office numbers.
Plot [ edit ]
Chun-Li moves from San Francisco to Hong Kong with their family. While practicing being a concert pianist, they learn wushu from their father, business person Xiang. For a while, their life is perfect until one night, Xiang is attacked and abducted by M. Bison's henchmen in front of Chun-Li. When Chun-Li was grabbed, Xiang had no other choice but to stop resisting.
Years later, Chun-Li grows up and becomes a talented pianist. At the end of their concert, they receive a mysterious scroll written in ancient Chinese text. Shortly after, they lose their mother to cancer. Meanwhile, at Shadaloo headquarters in Bangkok, Thailand, Bison announces their complete control of the organization before they have the other shareholders executed by one of their henchmen, Vega. It is also revealed that Xiang is still alive and working for Bison.
The next day, Royal Thai Police detective Maya Sunee meets Interpol agent Charlie Nash, when both are called to investigate the murder of some crime syndicate families in Bangkok. Nash informs Maya that the Shadaloo perpetrated these crimes. Back in Hong Kong, an elderly woman translates Chun-Li's scroll and tells them to travel to Bangkok and find a man named Gen. Chun-Li then leaves their home and travels to Bangkok, living homeless and searching for Gen for several days. A fight with local gangsters one night leaves them exhausted and unconscious, and Gen appears and brings them to their home.
Gen informs them that they were once comrades with Bison and they know how to find their father, and for the next few days, they teach them their style of martial arts. Chun-Li also learns more about Bison, who is operating Shadaloo publicly, and is holding the families of property owners hostage in order to force them to sign their property over to him. While spying on Bison's henchman Balrog, they overhear that a property owner is asked to hand over the rights to a docking harbor, allowing the shipment of the "White Rose".
Later that night, Chun-Li confronts Cantana, one of Bison's secretaries, in a nightclub. They obtain information on the location of the White Rose before escaping from Shadaloo's thugs and Nash and Maya. As a result of this incident, Cantana is used as a punching bag by Bison the next day and killed.
Gen tells Chun-Li more of Bison's origin. The son of Irish missionaries, Bison grew up an orphan and lived their entire life as a thief. Many years later, as a means of becoming completely evil, they killed their pregnant wife and transferred their conscience into their prematurely born daughter. After telling Chun-Li to go and fetch some food, Gen is attacked by Shadaloo troops before Balrog blows up their house. Chun-Li runs off when they are attacked by Vega, whom they soundly defeat and leaves hanging by the side of a building.
The next day, Chun-Li interrogates a harbor employee into telling them the arrival time of the White Rose. They return to the shipping yard that night, only to fall into a trap as Bison and their soldiers capture them Tied up and brought into an undisclosed house, they are reunited with Xiang, only for Bison to kill them by breaking their neck. After Bison and Balrog leave the house, Chun-Li uses their skills to defeat the guards and escape. During the escape, they are shot in the arm by Balrog while trying to protect a child. Angered Thai locals then pelt Balrog and other Shadaloo henchmen with fruits, food, and other merchandise. Chun-Li is reunited with Gen, who heals their wounds and continues with their training.
Despite being taken off the assignment, Nash is secretly asked by Chun-Li to back them up in taking down Bison. Nash and Chun-Li, along with Maya and their SWAT team, arrive at the shipping yard, where they engage in a shootout with Shadaloo forces. Maya is wounded in the shootout, but their SWAT team manages to dwindle Shadaloo's numbers. Meanwhile, Chun-Li enters a ship and meets a girl who speaks Russian asking for their father before leaving them to continue their search for Bison. In another part of the ship, Gen faces off against Balrog, ultimately impaling them with a liquid nitrogen pipe. Bison takes the girl, who is revealed to be their daughter Rose, and flees the scene by helicopter.
Chun-Li, Gen, Nash and a SWAT officer arrive at Bison's headquarters, where Nash and the officer take Rose out to safety while Chun-Li and Gen face Bison. After a long battle, Chun-Li hits Bison with a bamboo pole and drops sandbags on him, stunning him. They then charges up a Kikoken and shoots it at him, knocking them off the scaffolding before they jump and twists their neck with their legs. Nash tells Chun-Li to leave the scene as Thai police arrive.
Chun-Li returns to their home in Hong Kong and settles down when Gen pays them a visit. They show them a newspaper ad for an upcoming Street Fighter tournament, telling them that a Japanese fighter named Ryu might be a recruit for their cause. They decline the offer, telling them they are home for now.
Cast [ edit ]
Production [ edit ]
Rick Yune was originally cast as Gen but was replaced by Robin Shou, who played Liu Kang, the lead character in the Mortal Kombat films.[5] Shooting locations included Hong Kong, China; Bangkok, Thailand; Vancouver, Canada; and Reno, Nevada and Herlong, California, United States.
Release [ edit ]
The film was released on DVD and Blu-ray on June 30, 2009. The special First Run release included a bonus DVD of the Udon Street Fighter Comic Series: "Round One FIGHT."[citation needed] The film was not cinematically released in Australia but was released straight to DVD on January 14, 2010.[6]
Reception [ edit ]
The film opened at #9 at the American DVD sales chart, selling 92,830 units in the first weekend. About 258,000 DVD units have been sold so far in the United States, bringing in revenue of $4.7m. This figure does not include DVD rentals/Blu-ray sales.[7]
Street Fighter: The Legend of Chun-Li, like the previous live-action film in the series, received mostly negative reviews and was not pre-screened for critics.[8] Review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes gives the film a rating of 6% based on 54 reviews.[9] It was ranked 44th in Rotten Tomatoes' 100 worst reviewed films of the 2000s based on a score of 4% in 2009, though the current score is 18% due to a bug assigning reviews from The Fighter to the film,[10] with the critical consensus "The combination of a shallow plot and miscast performers renders Street Fighter: The Legend of Chun Li a perfectly forgettable video game adaptation." At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the film has received an average score of 17, based on 11 reviews.[11]
Film historian Leonard Maltin seemed to agree, stating that "The 1994 movie was one of the worst films ever inspired by a video game; it should have been titled Four A Hundred Funerals and No Sex. Yet this bomb makes it predecessor seem like Gone With the Wind."
Among the film's more positive reviews, Rob Nelson of Variety wrote: "Neither the best nor the worst of movies derived from video games, Street Fighter: The Legend of Chun-Li at least gives action fans plenty to ogle besides the titular hero (Kristin Kreuk)."[12] Jeannette Catsoulis of The New York Times wrote that the film was "reveling in the vivid Bangkok locations, Geoff Boyle's photography is crisp and bright, and Dion Lam's action choreography unusually witty."[13]
Negative reviews focused on the screenplay and fight scenes. Frank Scheck of The Hollywood Reporter wrote that "other than a few reasonably well-staged fight sequences, the proceedings are dull and visually uninspired. Justin Marks' solemn screenplay lacks any trace of wit."[11][14]Jeremy Wheeler of TV Guide wrote: "Fight scenes, while admirable for shaking off the shaky-cam aesthetic of their big-screen brethren, neither inspire nor find a good balance between martial arts and FX-laden power punches."[15] Jim Vejvoda of IGN gave the film 1.5 stars out of 5, writing: "There's better staged and more enjoyable brawls between Peter and The Chicken on Family Guy."[16] Ryan Davis of Giant Bomb described it as "a re-envisioning [of the source material] by people who can't see."[17]
Ed Morrissey spent some time talking to the owner of a Minneapolis/St. Paul pizza and sandwich restaurant about the impact on their business of the new requirement that restaurants post calorie counts on their menus:
Ed sums it up:
The pressure of this law will eventually force restaurants like Davanni's to reduce consumer choice as a way of managing the overwhelming burden of maintaining their disclosures. Smaller chains that succeed in satisfying their customers and managing their business used to be rewarded with growth, but this law will put an artificial cap on expansion at 19 locations. That means that fewer people will find jobs, and even in existing stores, money that may have funded more jobs will instead go to reprinting the same menu boards over and over again. And all of this comes because political elites think that people are too stupid to know that a pizza is fattening or how to access information that already exists in much more efficient formats than menu boards.
The 22nd volume of Jun Mochizuki's Pandora Hearts manga announced on Saturday that the series will end in the next volume. Yen Press will publish the 21st volume in North America in July, and it describes the manga's story:
The air of celebration surrounding fifteen-year-old Oz Vessalius's coming-of-age ceremony quickly turns to horror when they are condemned for a sin about which they know nothing.  They are thrown into an eternal, inescapable prison known as the Abyss from which there is no escape. There, they meet a young girl named Alice, who is not what they seem. Now that the relentless cogs of fate have begun to turn, do they lead only to crushing despair for Oz, or is there some shred of hope for them to grasp on to?
Executives from at least 10 NBA teams, including a representative from the Knicks, were at North Carolina State on Thursday for Dennis Smith Jr.'s pro day.
Though the 6-foot-3 first-year student point guard is projected in the mid-lottery in most mock drafts, Smith's longtime trainer told The Post that talent evaluators will be eyeballing the most talented player available in the June 22 draft.
Shawn Farmer, the garrulous 48-year-old trainer who played eight seasons overseas, believes Smith has gotten a bum rap from the Wolfpack's miserable season. They said scouts don't take into account the diligence Smith showed in making it back from an ACL tear that cost them their senior year of high school.
“The kid is the best player in the draft — hands down,'' Farmer told The Post in a phone interview Thursday. “No disrespect to Markelle [Fultz], no disrespect to Josh [Jackson], no disrespect to Lonzo [Ball]. I've seen all the kids play. It's not being biased. Dennis Smith is the best player in the draft — the most upside of anyone in the draft. You can print all of that.''
Nine days ago, Smith arrived in New York and met with Knicks president Phil Jackson for a dinner, but never worked out on the court. According to Farmer, it was “an agent thing.''
“It's not like Dennis didn't want to work out,'' Farmer said.
With the pro day scheduled for the following week — the Knicks were represented Thursday by college-scouting director, Mark Hughes, who recently interviewed for the Hawks' general manager job — they skipped an on-court, solo workout (Jackson prefers group workouts to run through the triangle).
The Knicks wanted Smith, because they skipped the Chicago combine, to take measurements and a medical exam during their visit, according to Farmer. Smith's reps declined. However, Smith did some drills in a workout last week for the Lakers, reportedly logging a 48-inch vertical jump, tied for the highest recorded in NBA history. On Thursday, Smith performed shooting, pick-and-roll and dunking drills.
Jackson still interviewed Smith, whose leadership was questioned as a first-year student as they led NC State to a 4-14 record in the ACC, second-worst in the league.
“From what I hear, they did have a good meeting,'' Farmer said. “I know Dennis respects people who came before him. They respect what Phil Jackson's done with Michael, respects what Phil did with Kobe and Shaq and all those title teams. Dennis is a student of the game. They have a lot of respect for Phil and their accomplishments.''
Playing in New York is an opportunity Smith would embrace, Farmer said, despite the Knicks' four straight seasons out of the playoffs.
“He got a taste for New York at the ACC tournament,'' Farmer said. “He loves being the underdog, don't like to be the front-runner. He's been the underdog their whole life. New York is considered the underdog organization now. Before they were a prominent organization. Lately they're underdogs. Who wouldn't want to play in New York and bring them back? That was their mindset going to NC State.''
Smith's journey is well-documented. They tore their ACL in August before senior year in an AAU game. They graduated from high school a semester early so they could enroll at NC State in January 2016 to begin their course load and finish their rehab with NC State's medical staff.
Nothing gets Farmer's goat more than negative critiques that Smith didn't make their teammates better and that their attitude contributed to a losing environment. NC State's coaching staff was fired in February, though Mark Gottfried and their assistants finished out the season.
“Totally unfair,'' Farmer said. “How can you say that about a kid who tore their ACL, been out a year. rehabbed, came into major a conference like the ACC, put an entire university on their back? They did a great job of keeping poise, composure. They didn't fire back on teammates or coaches. They handled the situation as good as anyone. They didn't have a good season the year before.
“They labeled them as not being a leader. What else did you want the kid to do? Two triple doubles, led the ACC in assists and that Duke game was a statement game.''
Smith was named ACC Freshman of the Year after averaging 18.1 points and 6.2 assists per game. Smith put up 32 points and six assists as NC State won on the road at Duke in January.
“People have no idea how this kid worked back, how hard they attacked their rehab,” Farmer said. “I picked Dennis up off the floor after they tore their ACL in LA. I was right there when their doctor told them it was 99 percent torn. They didn't get down on himself. They attacked it.
”A lot of people don't know what went into coming back from a devastating injury like that. It could've been catastrophic. Mentally, it could've been catastrophic. And he's still being labeled. ‘Can they lead a team, their decision-making?' That's what a leader does. A leader is somebody who is behind the scenes, when media like you guys don't see, [and] prepared themselves to be 100 percent when they went to NC State.''
Farmer gives Smith's father, Dennis Smith Sr., the most credit for getting their son to this point – a week from their name being announced as an NBA lottery pick. Smith's mother left when they were young. Farmer said the elder Smith drove their son four days a week from Fayetteville, NC, to a Duke sports medicine facility and jogged with them on the track “every step of the way'' during their recovery from the knee injury.
“The dad attacked the rehab as much as Dennis,'' Farmer said. “Nobody gives Senior credit. They talk about Mother's Day. No disrespect to moms, but Mother's Day you can't get into a restaurant. Father's Day? You can get in anywhere you want. We don't get enough credit. I've seen what he's done molding a professional basketball player.''
Brandi Burgess wants you to know they love their dad. And their dad loves them
That's not at issue. That's not the issue.
Brandi's dad is Rick Burgess of Rick & Bubba, the conservative comic radio powerhouse heard on more than 50 stations from its base in Birmingham to Fairbanks, Alaska. It's a show with a massive voice, rooted in the humor of the erstwhile "sexiest fat men alive." It's also a show where Rick expresses a devout Christian faith and literal conservative theology.
Brandi, now 27, grew up with and sometimes on that show. From college they taught the cast of radio characters how to hold their mouths to talk less ... Southern. More recently they called in from Eastern Europe after teaching locals phrases like "Hey y'all" or "War Eagle."
Brandi Burgess, bisexual daughter of Rick & Bubba host: 'I am praying for my father' "I am telling you this because I can no longer avoid my own eyes in the mirror."
But they felt, in their later appearances, anyway, that it was a lie. Because they were not who their dad wanted them to be. They were not what the audience thought them to be.
"I am a queer person living in Philadelphia," is how they put it to me in the form of introduction. "I am an actor, theater maker, and educator. I am an activist for gender equality, feminism, social justice, and a better tomorrow."
Brandi Burgess has a story. And they feel compelled to tell it.
Brandi and Rick Burgess. (special)
It is not so much about Rick or their family or their admonitions for them to repent. They say over and over that their father has never done anything that wasn't - in their eyes - rooted in love and concern, both for them and for the God they believe in. They have merely lived their life as they have preached their beliefs on and off the show.
But that doesn't mean it hasn't been painful to hear that people like them are bound for hell, that they - as they have been told by their father - has been corrupted by the world and is living a lie.
Brandi's could be the story of thousands of LGBTQ men and women born to evangelical families. It's one of guilt and shame and a kind of eventual courage. The only difference is the platform of their father.
"I've been used as an example of sin and cast in the role of the modern day prodigal daughter," they said. "I have had evangelicals show up at my door unannounced, begging for me to repent. I have had strangers writing my names on stones in Jerusalem."
It's not that Rick condemns them on the show. They have spoken of them in generalities in Bible studies posted on the Rick & Bubba website, and is clear they love their daughter, even if they disapprove of the life they lead.
Rick declined to comment on Brandi's decision to tell their own story, saying they would comment on their own show. "God has given me my own platform in which to clearly state my views on this issue that is impacting our society and the church," they said.
And that, frankly, is the reason Brandi feels compelled to speak.
The weight of their father's voice - taken as gospel by so many adoring fans -- has begun to drag on their own conscience.
Brandi and Rick Burgess (special)
They know what it's like to hear words of condemnation - even when not aimed specifically at them They know what it's like to feel hurt and doubt and disapproval. They worries for kids in church who hear that message and think only that they are broken.
But they know love and acceptance and faith build courage. They were raised in the church and holds to a profound belief in God. But their God is vast and complex and hard to limit.
So in the shadow of one of Alabama's largest voices, they have found their own. It is not meant to disparage their father. It is meant, they said, to provide another side.
"I have been silent," they said. "I have apologized. I have wept. I have gone to therapy. And now, I need to tell my story. I need to tell other queer people or feminists or activists that their voice matters, that they are not alone."
They speak so others will not retreat inside of themselves and be untrue to themselves, or wallow in shame or guilt, or hurt themselves.
"I cannot hear another story of someone dying or getting beat up or killing themselves without sharing my voice," they said. "Without saying I did all I could to fight in the name of love."
Brandi Burgess (special)
So she's out now for all the world to see. Out of their shadow, and the expectation of fans, into the light of their life.
They know there will be blowback, but she's OK with it.
Because they vow now that their goal for the future is to live braver. They want to stop "hiding in the Northeast," to return South to watch their hometown grow. They want to help others tell their stories.
"Mostly though, I am going to live my life," they said. "Fully. Without shame. I am going to become the person I have always wanted to be."
So they follow their principles. As their father follows their own.
6 Oz Chicken Breast Tenderloins
2 Tbsp Olive Oil
3 Tsp Grated Parmesan Cheese
2 Medium Zucchini
Garlic Basil Marinara
Salt and Pepper To Taste
1/2 Cup Shredded Mozzarella Cheese
To prepare the chicken place your chicken breasts in a skillet with 1 tbsp of olive oil. Salt and pepper them now. Cook on medium high heat until almost cooked through. Sprinkle your Parmesan cheese evenly on the chicken breasts. Turn the heat up slightly to the low end of high and flip the chicken over to sear the cheese. Flip back over when chicken is completely cooked.
Zoodles are finicky to make. There are several tricks I've learned that will help you the first time. Cook them too long and they're mush. Don't cook them long enough and the flavor is…off. First you'll want to wash your zucchini thoroughly and cut both ends off where the stem and flower were connected. Load the spiralizer according to your particular brands directions. This Paderno Spiral Vegetable Slicer is fairly simple to use. Spike the zuke on the handle where are the little plastic needles are and the other end centers on the hollow metal circle. This cores the zuke while you're spinning it. I also find that while spiralizing you need to cut the zoodles off every couple turns or you can end up with some very long noodles making them difficult to cook and eat!
From there I salt the noodles very heavily. I mean heavy. If you were to taste them your tongue would shrivel up from all the salt kind of heavy. The reason for this is you want the salt to draw moisture out of your zucchini so that the cooked product retains some snap and doesn't turn to mush. I then place the bowl of salted noodles in the fridge for half an hour or so. When you take them out strain them through a colander. There will be copious amounts of water. To cook them I use a nice wok. (T-fal Wok ) This allows me to toss the noodles so they cook evenly. I add one tablespoon of olive oil to the wok and heat to medium high. Place the noodles in the wok, salt and pepper them to taste and cover as best you can with a lid. This will steam the vegetables a little bit first. (You could also microwave them for a few minutes first. It accomplishes the same goal.) Then you have to drain them again. By this point even more water will have cooked out of them. I then turn the heat up. Not all the way but somewhere in the neighborhood of high. The noodles will be finished when you feel they are soft but have just a little bit of crunch left to them.
From there you split the zoodles in two on two plates, place your chicken on top, cover with a serving of marinara and 1/4 cup shredded mozzarella cheese. You can sprinkle extra grated parmesan cheese on top if you like! All in all it's a little bit of work but it satisfies that craving! Enjoy!
a review by the Crow.
OPENING THOUGHTS
In the summer of 2003, I picked up a magazine from a local newsagent'. This magazine (since loaned to a friend and therefore lost) introduced this crow to the works of Hideshi Hino, the recently-released Oldboy, and Ghost in the Shell (a promo for the English release of Innocence graced the cover, and it contained a review of said movie). One could say that the magazine represented a significant turning point in my life.
Some weeks later, I came across an episode of Stand Alone Complex on the telly. So, I started following the show. And once I'd caught up via the magic of re-runs, I was hooked.
I immediately went looking for what other things Ghost in the Shell there were to be found. At the time, there were two feature-length animated movies, three manga collections, and the anime series – all of which belonged to different fictional universes, mind you, but more on that later. And oh, how long I've wanted to talk about the franchise.
Recently, with trailers dropping for the upcoming Hollywood live-action movie, I've been meaning to do an analysis on everything Ghost in the Shell; however, no matter where I start, the road gets rocky. So – this crow thought – why not go back to the beginning and build from there?
Leading up to the release of the live-action movie (which I intend to thoroughly preview), The Corvid Review will do a complete breakdown of the series.
And we're going to start with the first movie as our access point. After all, it recently became 21 years old, and I'm a bit ashamed I never managed to do this in time for the anniversary.
For now, I'll keep things light, but as these posts start to pile up, I'll start analysing and interpreting the many facets to this franchise.
So, let's not wait around any longer. My ghost, it whispers to me. Let's dive in.
ALL OF THE WHISPERS
WARNING: THE SECTIONS BELOW CONTAIN MAJORteehee! SPOILERS
Ghost in the Shell opens with a meeting between Section 6 chief Nakamura and an American diplomat who has been working to help a programmer defect from Japan. Major Motoko Kusanagi stands above the building they are in, listening to their conversation. When the diplomat, faced with charges, claims immunity, they take off their overcoat and drops off the roof.
On the way down, they assassinate the diplomat and turns invisible (a future projection of therm-optic camouflage) as the security detail and SWAT team equivalent look on in disbelief.
Most people miss the importance of this scene. This isn't just showing off how much of a badass the Major is (this is just not the sort of woman you want to cross), but it's a small plot detail that I recommend paying attention to.
From here, we segue into the “making of cyborg” sequence (otherwise known as the “shelling” sequence). Set to an orchestral backdrop conducted by the master Kenji Kawai (who themselves plays some of the drums on occasion), we get to see the creation of Major Motoko Kusanagi.
In the world of Ghost in the Shell, technology has advanced far enough that prosthetic body parts and organs are commonplace, and the net is far more interlaced with our physical reality than we can even think about today.
The Major is a full-body cyborg. The only “original organic” parts of them are their brain, and possibly some pieces of spinal column.
Following the “making of cyborg” scene, the Major wakes up in their apartment (a scene that has since become one of the many iconic scenes of the movie over time).
Throughout the movie, we see Kusanagi wandering. First, they take a journey across the very Hong Kong-inspired Tokyo of 2029; and later, we see them diving in the ocean. These are both beautiful scenes (especially the first), but I'll get to their relevance later on in this post.
During this time, Section 9 (the public security outfit the Major works for) is hot on the heels of a master-hacker known only as the “Puppetmaster“. In the world of Ghost in the Shell, technology and society have become so interconnected that you can literally “ghost-hack” people. And so, all Section 9 have come up with so far are proxies being played to some ulterior motive or the other.
As the investigation continues, and Section 9 comes upon dead end following dead end, a mangled female body is brought to Section 9. A few hours ago, a prosthetic body factory was hacked, and the body was put together autonomously. After exiting the factory, the body was run over by a truck.
Section 9 discovers that there seems to be a human “ghost” inside the “shell” (see what went on there? See it?). Section 6 shows up, and it is uncovered that the “ghost” inside the body is the Puppetmaster itself (or himself, as some of the characters gender it). The Puppetmaster is the product of one Project 2501, a venture masterminded by Section 6 to create a system which can “ghost-hack” people and use them as proxies for espionage (and to otherwise act in Section 6's interests), despite Section 6's initial claims of Project 2501 being built to capture the “elusive” Puppetmaster.
During its ventures on the net, a part of Project 2501 gained a “ghost” (i.e.: became self-aware), and has since formed its own goals. Section 6 and other involved parties, have since been trying to trap the Puppetmaster, fearing the consequences of a rogue machine consciousness. And they've finally succeeded, by luring it down to a single body. Since Section 9 usually handles the “dirty work”, they've been made part of the process as well.
Section 6, however, raids Section 9 and makes off with the Puppetmaster. Section 9 gives chase, and it ends in a scene where the Major squares off, one-on-one, with a tank.
Following the battle sequence, in which Batou arrives to provide a much-needed assist, the Major and the Puppetmaster have a conversation.
The Puppetmaster is frustrated with its status as the ‘Other'. Unique as it is (superior, even), its immortality and its inability to reproduce make it feel an outcast, and so, it has used those very inadequacies to give itself a purpose.
And it's purpose? To seek out someone who can be the bridge between it and humanity. And the perfect bridge, it has found in Motoko Kusanagi, since they are like it – only from the human side of things.
During the movie, the Major's disconnection with the world has been driven home. The scenes highlighting this are the “wandering” scene and the “diving” scene. Even Batou – the closest person they have both in terms of cyberisation and friendship – is far, far more human than them Kusanagi simply doesn't feel human enough. All that makes them human is others' treatment of them as one.
Batou tries to stop the “dive” (to interlink between them), but is hacked by the Puppetmaster. The two stare into each other's ghosts awhile, and just then, Section 6's snipers blow their heads (literally, in the case of Kusanagi, despite Batou's attempt to save her) off.
At the very end, Kusanagi wakes up in a child's body, which is the best Batou could do at short-notice from the black market. They reveal to them that while they are now something new – a new consciousness born of the merger between them and the Puppetmaster, but who is neither of them.
They decide to leave alone, and Batou reminds them he'll always be around if they need him.
They stand at the edge of a hill by Batou's safehouse. Contemplating what comes next, they stare out across the vista and says:
“The net is vast and infinite.”
SOME OF THE GHOSTS
In this section, we'll be taking a quick look at the craft of the movie, as well as touch on the concepts it deals with.
CRAFT
Ghost in the Shell is a marvellously made movie, and while some might prefer the “updated” CGI-aided Ghost in the Shell 2.0 remake, I think the original is vastly superior. After having watched so much Ghost in the Shell over the years, every time I rewatch the “making of cyborg” sequence, I'm surprised to how quick things move. It's perfectly paced, but something about the scene – the visuals, the music, everything – puts me in mind of a much slower pace.
The art is stunning, and the few minutes that we spend wandering around the city with the Major are a stunning achievement. Pictured above is a similar scene, but from a different point in the the movie. The above is the location from which Batou and Ishikawa start narrowing down one of the proxies' locations while relaying information between Section 9 Chief Aramaki, and the Major and Togusa, who are also on the move.
The detail put into the scenes is amazing, and the way in which the “camera” glides through the city makes for one long spectacle.
And the music of the movie, oh my dear ghost! Is it ever lush. The soundtrack drips with strings and chimes that line up perfectly with the visuals. Better soundtracks are rare to come by. Just sitting and listening to it with your eyes closed puts you in exactly the frame of mind that the movie conveys.
THEMES
Ghost in the Shell involves far too many concepts for me to talk about all at once in this post. I'd have to turn my Žižek mode onsniff-sniff! and yammer on for hours, arguing this and that (and possibly drop a “dirbty joke!” for good measure); but I promised I'd touch on all those things at some other date. For now, I'll just list some of the major points the movie raises out:
What makes one human is the primary question running throughout the movie. It's explored by both Kusanagi and the Puppetmaster, as well as by Batou, Togusa, and others. Now that you have a general idea of what happens in the movie, you can probably guess to what ends this question leads and how.
The most significant supporting themes are replication and mirroring, variety, identities in posthuman environments, virtual memories, real memories, and emergence (I'm going to leave this term on this loose note). Ghost in the Shell has its own answers to some of the questions the concepts raise, and briefly argues the others as and when they come, but we don't live in its universe. So, the movie closes its own loops where it can, but we're left with the prospect that in the future we're headed to, these questions will inevitably become real-world issues.
NONE OF THE SHELLS
In terms of characters, Ghost in the Shell is quite a sparse movie. And to be honest, doing a character-by-character breakdown wouldn't be appropriate. The only real character here is the Major.
Now, I've spoiled the movie completely enough that not much is left to say to them No one else does anything. Batou has a few moments in the movie; Togusa and Ishikawa do their jobs; the Chief is the stolid leader they have been since the first manga series; and Nakamura resigns in disgrace. The Puppetmaster is the only other persona in the movie with any characterisation; and even it is naught but a mirror-image of the Major.
There are parts of the franchise where a character-by-character review would be important, but this movie is not one of them.
CLOSING THOUGHTS
I haven't yet mentioned how massive an influence Ghost in the Shell has been on me.
While since but only a babe I've had the intention of writing SF; it was only in 2006 that I started the draft of what will be my debut novel (to finally be a thing sooner rather than later, hopefully!) The story that eventually grew into the novel had been kind of slowly coming together over the years prior. And in the middle years, it was certainly heavily inspired by the franchise (specifically Stand Alone Complex).
The Puppetmaster pretty much influenced the make-up of my “It”, once I figured out where that angle would go; and while my novel's since departed from the heavy influence of Ghost in the Shell, I still have immense respect for the franchise.
The legacy of Ghost in the Shell is undeniably epic. The pitch for The Matrix apparently happened in an actual elevator, where the (then-brothers) Sisters Wachowski convinced Joel Silver to sit down and showed them this movie to make them understand that it was a workable idea.
The movie's influences (from the manga and beyond) and its immense legacy will be a topic I'll tackle at some other time. Like I said, I'll keep this review light. But oh, gracious me, is there a lot to talk about!
Expect lots more Ghost in the Shell from The Corvid Review in the coming weeks. We're only just getting started.
If you need to keep yourself busy in the meantime, remember:
“The net is vast and infinite.”
There are things to keep you busy until your beloved birds return (admittedly, they're not so interesting). Next up will be an overview of the original manga series.
Until we meet again, Major.
Final rating: 9/10
CBS News' Emily Schultheis, Jillian Hughes and Charlie Brooks contributed to this live blog.
9:55 p.m. ET Mr. Obama concluded by quoting the slogan for their first campaign, “Yes We Can.”
“I am asking you to hold fast to that faith written into our founding documents, that idea whispered by slaves and abolitionists, that spirit sung by immigrants and homesteaders and those who marched for justice, that creed reaffirmed by those who planted flags from foreign battlefields to the surface of the moon, a creed at the core of every American whose story is not yet written,” they said. “Yes we can. Yes we did. Yes we can.”
9:52 p.m. ET Thanking their staff and the legions of volunteers who helped their 2008 and 2012 campaigns, Mr. Obama said: “You did change the world.”
“To all of you out there – every organizer who moved to an unfamiliar town and kind family who welcomed them in, every volunteer who knocked on doors, every young person who cast a ballot for the first time, every American who lived and breathed the hard work of change – you are the best supporters and organizers anybody could hope for, and I will be forever grateful,” they said. “Because you did change the world. You did.”
9:50 p.m. ET Mr. Obama next thanked Vice President Joe Biden, saying they have become like a “brother” to him.
Biden, “the scrappy kid from Scranton who became Delaware's favorite son: you were the first decision I made as a nominee, and it was the best,” they said. “Not just because you have been a great Vice President, but because in the bargain, I gained a brother.”
9:47 p.m. ET Wiping back tears, Mr. Obama thanked their wife and two daughters.
“For the past twenty-five years, you have been not only my wife and mother of my children, you have been my best friend,” they said to Michelle Obama, sitting in the audience. “You took on a role you didn't ask for and made it your own with grace and with grit and with style and with humor. You made the White House a place that belongs to everybody. And a new generation sets its sights higher because it has you as a role model.”
To their daughters, Sasha and Malia, Mr. Obama said they have watched them become “amazing young women.”
“Malia and Sasha, under the strangest of circumstances, you have become two amazing young women, smart and beautiful, but more importantly, kind and thoughtful and full of passion,” they said. “You wore the burden of years in the spotlight so easily. Of all that I've done in my life, I'm most proud to be your dad.”
9:43 p.m. ET Mr. Obama said the most important title in a democracy is that of a “citizen” -- and laid a blueprint for how people can continue to be involved in safeguarding American democracy.
“If you're tired of arguing with strangers on the internet, try talking with one of them in real life,” they said. “If something needs fixing, then lace up your shoes and do some organizing. If you're disappointed by your elected officials, grab a clipboard, get some signatures, and run for office yourself. Show up. Dive in. Persevere.”
They acknowledged there are ups and downs for those involved in politics and the business of democracy.
“Sometimes you'll win. Sometimes you'll lose. Presuming a reservoir of goodness in others can be a risk, and there will be times when the process will disappoint you,” they said. “But for those of us fortunate enough to have been a part of this work, to see it up close, let me tell you, it can energize and inspire. And more often than not, your faith in America – and in Americans – will be confirmed. Mine sure has been.”
9:38 p.m. ET Americans cannot and should not take democracy for granted, Mr. Obama said.
“Our democracy is threatened whenever we take it for granted,” they said. “All of us, regardless of party, should throw ourselves into the task of rebuilding our democratic institutions.”
Among the issues they raised were expanding voting rights, increasing transparency in government and reversing electoral gerrymandering that's contributed to increasing polarization in Congress.
9:36 p.m. ET Mr. Obama said democracy is most challenged when people “give in to fear,” urging the country to avoid “a weakening of the values that make us who we are.”
“That's why, for the past eight years, I've worked to put the fight against terrorism on a firmer legal footing,” they said. “That's why we've ended torture, worked to close Gitmo, and reform our laws governing surveillance to protect privacy and civil liberties.”
“That's why I reject discrimination against Muslim Americans,” they continued, to applause. “That's why we cannot withdraw from big global fights – to expand democracy, and human rights, and women's rights, and LGBT rights – no matter how imperfect our efforts, no matter how expedient ignoring such values may seem. That's part of defending America. For the fight against extremism and intolerance and sectarianism and chauvinism are of a piece with the fight against authoritarianism and nationalist aggression.”
9:33 p.m. ET Next, Mr. Obama turned to the issue of terrorism -- both at home and abroad.
“Because of the extraordinary courage of our men and women in uniform, and the intelligence officers, law enforcement, and diplomats who support them, no foreign terrorist organization has successfully planned and executed an attack on our homeland these past eight years,” they said. “And although Boston and Orlando remind us of how dangerous radicalization can be, our law enforcement agencies are more effective and vigilant than ever. We've taken out tens of thousands of terrorists – including Osama bin Laden.
“The global coalition we're leading against ISIL has taken out their leaders, and taken away about half their territory,” they continued. “ISIL will be destroyed, and no one who threatens America will ever be safe.”
9:31 p.m. ET Nodding to the issue of climate change -- on which Mr. Trump is a self-described skeptic -- Mr. Obama said it is essential that the U.S. continue its progress.
“In just eight years, we've halved our dependence on foreign oil, doubled our renewable energy, and led the world to an agreement that has the promise to save this planet,” they said. “But without bolder action, our children won't have time to debate the existence of climate change; they'll be busy dealing with its effects: environmental disasters, economic disruptions, and waves of climate refugees seeking sanctuary.”
Pretending the problem doesn't exist “not only betrays future generations, it betrays the essential spirit of this country,” Mr. Obama continued.
9:28 p.m. ET Mr. Obama urged people to find ways to keep from “talking past each other.”
“Isn't that part of what so often makes politics so dispiriting?” they asked. “How can elected officials rage about deficits when we propose to spend money on preschool for kids, but not when we're cutting taxes for corporations? How do we excuse ethical lapses in our own party, but pounce when the other party does the same thing?
“It's not just dishonest, this selective sorting of the facts; it's self-defeating,” they continued. “Because as my mom used to tell me, reality has a way of catching up with you.”
9:26 p.m. ET Another threat to American democracy, Mr. Obama said, is people's collective retreat into their own “bubbles.”
“The rise of naked partisanship, increasing economic and regional stratification, the splintering of our media into a channel for every taste – all this makes this great sorting seem natural, even inevitable,” they said. “And increasingly, we become so secure in our bubbles that we accept only information, whether true or not, that fits our opinions, instead of basing our opinions on the evidence that's out there.”
9:23 p.m. ET Mr. Obama also spoke about the racial tensions still plaguing the country, which have been put on display in recent months with clashes between the police and the African American community.
“After my election, there was talk of a post-racial America,” they said. “Such a vision, however well-intended, was never realistic. For race remains a potent and often divisive force in our society.”
While progress has been made, they continued, “we're not where we need to be.”
“All of us have more work to do,” Mr. Obama said. “After all, if every economic issue is framed as a struggle between a hardworking white middle class and undeserving minorities, then workers of all shades will be left fighting for scraps while the wealthy withdrawal further into their private enclaves.”
9:21 p.m. ET As congressional Republicans debate their options for repealing and replacing the Affordable Care Act, Mr. Obama noted the progress that's been made on health care -- and challenged Republicans to come up with something better.
“Health care costs are rising at the slowest rate in fifty years,” they said. “And if anyone can put together a plan that is demonstrably better than the improvements we've made to our health care system – that covers as many people at less cost – I will publicly support it.”
9:19 p.m. ET Mr. Obama framed their remarks as a look at the “state of our democracy,” outlining the challenges the country will face going forward.
“A shrinking world, growing inequality; demographic change and the specter of terrorism – these forces haven't just tested our security and prosperity, but they're testing our democracy as well,” they said. “And how we meet these challenges to our democracy will determine our ability to educate our kids, and create good jobs, and protect our homeland.”
9:14 p.m. ET Acknowledging the tradition of a peaceful transition of power, Mr. Obama said they had assured President-elect Donald Trump that there would be a smooth transition.
“In ten days, the world will witness a hallmark of our democracy: the peaceful transfer of power from one freely-elected president to the next,” they said, to boos from the audience. “I committed to President-Elect Trump that my administration would ensure the smoothest possible transition, just as President Bush did for me.”
9:13 p.m. ET In a nod to their legacy, Mr. Obama said the U.S. is “a better, stronger place” than it was when they took office.
“If I had told you eight years ago that America would reverse a great recession, reboot our auto industry, and unleash the longest stretch of job creation in our history…if I had told you that we would open up a new chapter with the Cuban people, shut down Iran's nuclear weapons program without firing a shot, and take out the mastermind of 9/11…if I had told you that we would win marriage equality, and secure the right to health insurance for another 20 million of our fellow citizens – you might have said our sights were set a little too high,” they said. “But that's what we did. That's what you did.”
9:09 p.m. ET Mr. Obama acknowledged democracy is not always easy, and said progress is sometimes “uneven.”
“Yes, our progress has been uneven,” they said. “The work of democracy has always been hard, contentious and sometimes bloody. For every two steps forward, it often feels we take one step back. But the long sweep of America has been defined by forward motion, a constant widening of our founding creed to embrace all, and not just some.”
9:04 p.m ET Mr. Obama was met with loud, sustained cheers when they took the stage. After telling the crowd to quiet down -- “we're on live TV here, I've got to move,” they said -- Mr. Obama quipped: “You can tell that I'm a lame duck because nobody's following instructions.”
9:02 p.m. ET President Obama takes the stage at McCormack Place in Chicago. “Hello Chicago,” they said. “It's good to be home.”
6:35 p.m. ET When they take the stage tonight, President Obama will talk about how their youth in Chicago helped show them the way to effect real change in the United States, according to speech excerpts released by the White House.
“I first came to Chicago when I was in my early twenties, still trying to figure out who I was; still searching for a purpose to my life,” they will say. “It was in neighborhoods not far from here where I began working with church groups in the shadows of closed steel mills. It was on these streets where I witnessed the power of faith, and the quiet dignity of working people in the face of struggle and loss.
“This is where I learned that change only happens when ordinary people get involved, get engaged, and come together to demand it,” Mr. Obama will continue. “After eight years as your President, I still believe that. And it's not just my belief. It's the beating heart of our American idea – our bold experiment in self-government.”
1 p.m. ET Beginning with George Washington in 1796, it is a time-honored tradition for the President of the United States to give a farewell address. President Obama will continue that tradition on Tuesday when they speak in Chicago at McCormack Place at 9 p.m. ET.
CBSN coverage of Obama's farewell speech begins at 7 p.m. ET
According to Mr. Obama's chief of staff, Dennis McDonough, they chose Chicago because “this is a place where working on the South Side of Chicago and the neighborhoods … in the shadows of the abandoned steel mills, as a community organizer with people who had been knocked out of jobs that theretofore had been real paths to the middle class, that they recognized that they had a gift for organizing.”
Their message to Americans, McDonough told CBS News' Charlie Rose, is to keep fighting for what you believe in.
“He had a gift for getting people working together towards the same goal. And I think that's what you'll hear a lot about from the president tomorrow, the importance of sticking together, working together, standing up for what you believe in, and then fighting like hell for it.”
Vice President Joe Biden and Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel, who was Mr. Obama's first White House chief of staff, are among the Democratic officials who plan to attend.
Mr. Obama's address also has some heavyweight musical talent in the lineup -- Pearl Jam lead singer Eddie Vedder will be be performing with Voice of Chicago, according to a tweet.

Gene Simmons, the blood-spitting bassist and vocalist of rock supergroup Kiss, had some harsh truths for listeners tuning into an interview on Chicago's WGN Radio about politics in the United States.
"The last thing we should be doing as a country is to fight with each other,” Simmons said. “Everybody's got a different point of view, and that's okay — that's what makes America great.”
"By the way, al Qaeda, al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigade, all the bad guys in the Middle East don't make a distinction between left and right, Democrat or Republican; they hate all of you,” they added. “They just think you're all Americans. Now that's a good idea — the American party."
Simmons did, however, deviate from their own advice given back in December when they urged celebrities to keep their “pie holes” shut instead of ranting on and on against Donald Trump. But as a friend and former contestant on Trump's The Celebrity Apprentice, Simmons echoed their previous comments:
"And for people out there who think every time you say 'President Trump' that it's a political conversation, I urge everybody to just take a deep breath. They were elected, and so were the Republicans across America. And the next time there's an election, you'll have a chance to draw the curtains — because it's nobody's damn business who you vote for — and vote your conscience. If you like our president, you'll vote them back in. If you don't like him, then you'll vote for somebody else."
In a Rolling Stone interview last year, Simmons said Trump is “good for the political system” because of how “everybody is sick and tired of being politically correct.”
“Secretly, tens of millions, perhaps a hundred million people, may actually have some positive feelings about a wall,” Simmons said.
And if you've followed Simmons' career at all over the past 40 years, you already know it's impossible for them to keep their pie hole shut. They wouldn't be the demon if they did:
In the past few weeks, two major reports on teacher turnover and retention have been released. One was rolled out with extensive media coverage, and has been the subject of much discussion among policymakers and education commentators. The other was written by me, along with Teachers College doctoral student Clare Buckley.
The first report, “The Irreplaceables: Understanding the Real Retention Crisis in America's Urban Schools,” was prepared by TNTP, an organization formerly known as The New Teacher Project that prepares and provides support for teachers in urban districts, and that advocates for changes in teacher policy. The second, “Thoughts of Leaving: An Exploration of Why New York City Middle School Teachers Consider Leaving Their Classrooms,” was released by the Research Alliance for New York City Schools (RANYCS), a nonprofit research group based at New York University. (RANYCS published a report by Will Marinell in February 2011 that examined detailed patterns of teacher turnover in New York City middle schools apparent through the district's human-resources office.)
There are some important similarities between the two new reports. Both surveyed teachers in large urban districts about their plans to stay in their current schools or to depart either for other schools, other districts or other careers. Both also sought to understand the features of teachers' work on the job that were influential in their plans to stay or leave. The study of New York City relied on a large, anonymous sample of middle-school teachers: roughly 80 percent of the full-time teachers in 125 middle schools across the city. In contrast, the TNTP study surveyed smaller numbers of teachers in four urban districts (one of which appears to be New York City), and the surveys were not anonymous, because TNTP wanted to link teachers' survey responses to what the authors viewed as measures of teachers' performance, such as value-added scores or summary teacher evaluations.
The headlines from the two studies aren't that different: In any given school, many teachers think about leaving, and it's not easy to predict why some teachers are more poised to move than others. The NYC study suggested that the rhythms of teachers' lives matter, including their pathways into teaching and the positioning of teaching in a life with adult family responsibilities. The teachers prepared through alternate routes such as the NYC Teaching Fellows and Teach For America—26 percent of those surveyed—were more likely to consider leaving their classrooms and schools, even when other teacher characteristics were taken into account. And teachers who were separated, widowed or divorced, and those with responsibilities for raising children, were less likely to think about leaving, perhaps because of the financial risks. Commuting, too, takes a toll, with teachers who commute an hour or more each way to their jobs more likely than those with shorter commutes to think of leaving their current schools—but not more likely to think about leaving teaching altogether.
But regardless of teachers' biographies, administrative leadership and support—and student behavior and discipline—matter a great deal. Teachers are more likely to consider leaving their classrooms if they believe they aren't getting adequate support from their principals, and if they believe the school doesn't function well as an organization. Good leadership is not randomly distributed among schools; on average, NYC teachers report less satisfaction with the leadership in schools serving high concentrations of low-achieving, high-need students.
The key divergence between the two studies is that the TNTP report sought to identify high-performing teachers—whom the authors labeled “irreplaceables”—and low-performers. These groups, the TNTP authors believe, are stable; a teacher identified as a high-performer early in their or their career is likely to stay that way, and low-performers, although they may work just as hard, unfortunately rarely get better. Rather than try to provide extensive support to struggling teachers early in their careers, TNTP argues, it's more efficient to invest in retaining the “irreplaceables,” and to counsel out—or move more aggressively to push out—low-performers who may well be replaced by teachers who will be “better.” To date, the authors suggest, principals have not been this strategic, leaving who stays and who leaves pretty much up to chance.
I'm less sanguine than the TNTP authors about the ability to easily identify those teachers who are “irreplaceable” and those who are—what? Expendable? Disposable? Unsalvageable? Superfluous? The terms are so jarring that it's hard to know how a principal might treat such a teacher with compassion and respect. Given what we know about the instability from year to year in teachers' value-added scores as well as the learning curve of novice professionals, a reliance on a rigid classification of teachers into these two boxes seems unrealistic.
I don't doubt that there are some individuals who are natural-born teachers, just as Michael Phelps has shown themselves to be a natural-born swimmer, and perhaps their talents are revealed on Day One. But there are thousands and thousands of children and youth around the world who are competitive swimmers, and none of them is Michael Phelps. For these children and youth, as for most teachers—and there are approximately 3.5 million full-time K-12 teachers in the United States—technique and practice can yield great improvements in performance. This is perhaps even more true in teaching than in swimming, as there are many goals to which teachers must attend simultaneously, rather than just swimming fast to touch the wall as soon as possible.
Principals must, it seems, strike a delicate balance, seeking to cultivate a professional community of successful teachers through a mix of selection, “de-selection” and professional development. But even in systems that view principals as “mini-CEOs” of their schools, knowledge of teaching practice is distributed throughout the school and district.
It's true that teacher professional development is often weak and ineffective, and, particularly in the early career, probably requires a more coherent strategy and division of labor than currently exists in most school districts. But that's not a convincing rationale for giving up on professional development for all teachers in favor of the quick termination of those teachers who don't hit the ground running.
There's a reason revolving doors are frequently out of order.
Arne Duncan famously said, “You can't fire your way to the top.” TNTP apparently disagrees. For once, I agree with Arne—mark the date.
Hillary Clinton said that the amateur U.S. film that depicts the prophet Muhammed as a fraud was "disgusting and reprehensible." Meanwhile, rioters stormed the U.S. embassy in Yemen on Thursday morning, breaching the wall of the embassy and setting fire to vehicles as security forces reportedly opened fire. Security forces managed to gain control of the compound in Sanaa by using the live ammunition, tear gas and water cannons, injuring several people, although protests continued outside the embassy walls. Protests have broken out throughout the Muslim world—including Iran, Tunisia, and Gaza. In Cairo, protests continued for the third day on Thursday outside the U.S. embassy, with at least 10 people injured in overnight clashes. In Libya, the U.S. ambassador and three others were killed on Tuesday by riots over the film outside the U.S. consulate in Benghazi.

Wow. I received an incredible gift. My secret Santa made me a pencil. Like, they turned it themselves and made an incredible mechanical pencil. I had put down in the survey section that I am interested in woodworking and in addition to the handmade pencil, I received some flat pencils. My Santa told me that they are useful in the shop because they don't roll away from you.
The wood in the pencil is called "lingum vitae". It is a beautiful wood and this is not stained, this is the natural color. I tried to get a good picture, but I couldn't get one to really show off the beauty of this pencil.
So, thanks to you, Santa. This is a gift I will treasure. I kind of don't want to use it, I just want to display it somehow and show off the beauty and skill that this took. I am impressed by your craftsmanship, secret Santa. Thank you.
The Sporting District The 1911–1912 Blue Book, a tourist guide to San Antonio's Sporting District Date 1889 ( ) – 1941 ( 1941 ) Location San Antonio, Texas, USA Also known as The District
The Sporting District in the U.S. city of San Antonio, Texas was a red-light district in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. It was established by the city council to manage prostitution in the city. For a time it was one of the nation's largest vice districts with venues ranging from brothels to gambling halls. The area was officially shut down in 1941 resulting from the mobilization for World War II.
The term sporting was a common 19th-century euphemism for gambling and/or prostitution. Many communities around the U.S. used this term; brothels were often referred to as sporting houses.
Boundaries [ edit ]
The District contained approximately 10 blocks of the city.[1] Its boundary was described as follows in a tourist guide:[2]
... south on South Santa Rosa Street for three blocks, beginning at Dolorosa Street, thence from the 100 block to the end of the 500 block on Matamoras Street, thence from the 200 block to the 500 block on South Concho Street, and lastly the 100 block on Monterey Street. This is the boundary within which the women are compelled to live according to law. — The Blue Book for Visitors and Tourists and those Seeking a Good Time while in San Antonio, Texas
History [ edit ]
During the earlier years of the state, San Antonio was Texas' largest city. One of the city's most important business leaders was Jack Harris, who established the Vaudeville Theater and Saloon in 1872, in what would later become the Sporting District. The saloon, which was the city's first business to utilize the fledgeling Electric Company in 1882, quickly became the most popular entertainment venue in the city, offering liquor, live theater, and gambling.[3] Soon other entertainment entrepreneurs, including prostitutes, appeared nearby. The Theater's location, the corner of Soledad and Commerce, became known as "Fatal Corner", owing to the violent crowd that the saloon attracted.[4]
The Sporting District was formally established in 1889 by the San Antonio city council to contain and regulate prostitution.[1] The area became home to brothels, dance halls, saloons, gambling parlors, and other illegal, or at least vice-oriented, businesses. City officials did not officially condone the activities but rather unofficially regulated them.[1] The area also included many legitimate businesses including hotels and restaurants.[1]
By the early 20th century, the District had become so large that, not only was it the largest red-light district in Texas, but it was one of the largest in the nation[1][5] (third in the nation by some accounts).[6] Brothels were required to pay $500 annually in licensing fees.[6] In 1911 businesses in the area provided the city with approximately $50,000 ($1,344,000 in today's dollars) annually in licensing fees.[1] The most successful brothels boasted amenities such as ballrooms and orchestras. Because of the area's size a "Blue Book" was published as a tourist guide for visitors.[1][7] The 1911–1912 edition listed 106 vice entertainment venues as well as many other businesses.[1] In contrast to the relatively raucous red-light districts in other parts of the country, San Antonio's was known for being relatively subdued and civilized.[6] Despite its fame and economic significance however, very little was recorded about the District because neither city officials nor journalists were typically willing to acknowledge knowing about the illegal activities.[1]
An unusual facet of San Antonio's red-light district was the lack of racial segregation in the District.[7] Despite the general segregation that permeated society in Texas, establishments in the Sporting District generally catered to black men just as much as white men.[7]
Between the world wars, particularly during the Depression, the District deteriorated as higher-class prostitutes abandoned the area in favor of working as call girls in hotels.[8] Violent crime and theft in the area grew. With the arrival of World War II, the District gained the disapproval of the local army leadership, particularly Dwight D. Eisenhower, who was then the Third Army's chief of staff at Fort Sam Houston from August to December 1941. The District was finally shut down in 1941 by San Antonio Police Commissioner P.L. Anderson, with the strong approval of Major General Richard Donovan.[1][9] In July 1941, President Franklin D. Roosevelt had signed into law a federal ban on prostitution near naval and army bases.[10] Despite the closure, San Antonio continued to be a major center of prostitution until well after the war.[8]
Major venues [ edit ]
The Jack Harris Vaudeville Saloon and Theater, circa 1880
The Sporting District contained numerous entertainment venues. The Vaudeville Theater and Saloon was one of the first and most prominent. Another famous venue was Fannie Porter's Sporting House, which was actually located a block outside the borders of the district as defined by the city. Apart from being a well-established brothel, the home became a hideout for the gang of famed outlaw Butch Cassidy.[11][12]
Other well-known venues included the Mansion, the Beauty Saloon, the White Elephant Saloon, and the Buckhorn Saloon.[6][13][14]

FORMER Anglo Irish Bank CEO David Drumm has arrived back in Ireland this morning, where they instantly jumped in a cab and went to the USIT office to apply for a J1 visa back to the States.
The shamed executive, who presided over Anglo Irish during the tumultuous lead-up to the fateful ‘bank guarantee' which ruined the country, had been extradited from the USA to face questioning over 33 allegations of fraud and false accounting.
Drumm has applied for a J1 visa, traditionally used by lads from Longford to go work on the buildings with their cousins during their summer holidays. If successful in their application, Drumm will be able to head back over to Boston for three to four months, thus avoiding questions about their part in the banking crisis that crippled the country.
“He's put down an accountancy firm in Boston that they can get a clerk job at for the summer,” said Patricia Conlon, who helped Mr. Drumm fill out their J1 application forms.
“Says they know a lad who works there that can sort them out for the summer. I asked them if they needed any help with finding accommodation, but they seem to think he'll be alright in that regard”.
The latest turn of events has led the Irish people to believe that nobody will ever be truly held accountable for the crisis that saddled a generation with an unpayable debt, which Mr. Drumm seems more than OK with.

Take a critical look at any Samsung flagship from the last six years, and you could apply the same complaint to all of them: "this 'premium' phone doesn't feel premium." While Samsung has aggressively pushed the envelope on screen sizes, SoCs, and extra hardware features, the exterior of their devices hasn't changed over the years.
Recently, this stagnation in design has correlated with a stagnation in sales. The Galaxy S5 didn't do nearly as well as Samsung had hoped it would, with reports saying sales were 40 percent below Samsung's estimates. In its quarterly earnings, the company has seen profits drop as much as 60 percent. Apple is building phablets now, ending Samsung's near-monopoly on the big-screen phone market, and Chinese OEMs like Xiaomi, Lenovo, and Huawei are attacking the company at the low end of the market. It's been a rough year for Samsung, and with the Galaxy S6, the company needs a winner.
After spending a week with the Galaxy S6, it's safe to say Samsung built the phone it needed to build. Unlike HTC, Samsung's response to adversity has been to change. The Galaxy S6 finally ditches Samsung's infamous cheap plastic exterior, which people have only been complaining about for five years now. The S6 is all glass, and while that leads to some compromises, we think the change is worth it. In every territory, the S6 will be fitted with an Exynos processor, which lets Samsung dodge the heat problems of the Snapdragon 810. The camera is one of the best ever on any smartphone, and some day Samsung will enable a promising new tap-to-pay system that is already integrated into this hardware.
Upgraders from the Galaxy S5 will find a lot to complain about, though. The Galaxy S6 is aimed more at the mainstream phone market and less at the power user, so the S6 cuts the MicroSD slot, removable battery, water resistance, and Micro USB 3.0 port. The glass back, while more premium feeling, is more fragile than the old removable plastic back. Power users should probably look elsewhere.

Even the first few iPhones were made of plastic, but the industry has evolved since then, with Apple leading the way toward glass backs and then aluminum. The rest of the industry slowly followed suit: HTC has been milling phones out of aluminum for some time, Xiaomi just launched a phablet made of glass and aluminum, and Motorola offers aluminum-framed devices with leather or even wood backs. The companies that do make heavier use of plastic—Motorola (the Nexus 6) and Microsoft (with the Lumia line)—at least use thick, often milled, plastic with a matte finish.
For the most part Samsung has let these material improvements pass them by—the Galaxy S5 felt like it was made out of the same low-quality plastic as the Galaxy S1. Even across Samsung's price ranges, the exterior didn't change much—there isn't a huge difference between the $100 Samsung Z1 (the Tizen phone) and the $650 Galaxy S5.
This year Samsung finally took a serious step toward improving the exterior of its flagship—it finally stopped using plastic. The front and back of the Galaxy S6 is Gorilla Glass 4, while the sides are an exposed aluminum frame. Samsung's new choice of materials isn't perfect—glass gives you a better, more solid feel in exchange for a loss of durability. We're only moving from 50 percent glass to 100 percent glass, so it's not like the Galaxy S5 was indestructible, either. The glass back is just another reason not to drop your phone, which is something you should try to avoid anyway.
Like other Samsung phones, the Galaxy S6 gets a metal band around the outside, but now it's actually metal, instead of plastic made to look like metal. Samsung previously did metal frames on the Note 4 and Galaxy Alpha, which used straight metal sides with chamfered edges. The Galaxy S6 takes a new approach—rounded aluminum—which is a dead ringer for an iPhone 6. It feels and looks great, but it will earn Samsung some ridicule given its history with Apple.
One part of the device we're not happy with is the design of the front, which looks like every other Samsung device in existence. The Galaxy S6 uses basically the same front design as the Galaxy S3, which makes four flagships now where Samsung hasn't significantly changed the part of the device its users see the most. We wish Samsung would have the paid as much attention to the front of its devices as it does to the internals—Samsung now has the redesign cycle of a car manufacturer. This is the other half of the "Samsung devices feel cheap" equation: a $100 Samsung device has the same design as a $650 one, and that design is four years old.
The back is the complete opposite. It's a brand-new design, and it looks great. It's just a smooth, flat sheet of glass with a sparing logo size and placement—we have a Sprint Galaxy S6, and there isn't even a Sprint logo on it! All of the colors in the S6 range have a shimmery metallic look to them that changes depending on how the light hits them. Our "blue" version runs the gamut from black to blue depending on the lighting conditions. The back is interrupted only by the returning LED/heart rate monitor (which still isn't very accurate) and the camera bump. The camera bump is substantial, which prevents the S6 from sitting stably on a flat surface, but it's worth it once you see the pictures it pumps out.
And now for the obligatory part where we talk about SD cards and removable batteries. These features were both in the Galaxy S5 and aren't in the Galaxy S6, and Samsung fans are mad about it. With the Galaxy S series, though, Samsung strives, above all else, to be mainstream. This is a phone designed to appeal to people who saw the advertisement on TV and walked into a Verizon Store to purchase "the new Galaxy phone." Normal people usually don't want to deal with the clunky process of using an SD card or swapping a battery—the absence of these features certainly hasn't hurt iPhone sales—so we really have no problem with those niche features not being in a company's most popular phone.
Power users and cloud-averse data hoarders are a market that should be addressed, but it's a good bet that these features were a waste for most of the millions of the non-tech savvy people who bought a Galaxy S phone. These are the most popular Android devices, purchased by millions of people, and we really don't see anything wrong with Samsung tailoring the phone feature set for that market.
The good news is that the S6 comes in a 128GB version now, so data hoarders still have an option. A 128GB MicroSD card is about $100, though—to upgrade from the base 32GB version to the 128GB version, you'll have to pay about twice that. And for those wondering, our fully updated Sprint GS6 had 9GB taken up by the OS, pre-installed apps, and updates.

As the College Fix reports, law students at the University of Pennsylvania are calling for Professor Amy Wax to be removed from their first-year teaching role.
According to the students, aligned under the UPenn chapter of the National Lawyers Guild, "Professor Wax's statements amount to an explicit and implicit endorsement of white supremacy."
The students are upset about an op-ed Wax co-wrote last month, in which they lamented the cultural revolution and the decline of what they see as healthy social values.
Yet reading Wax's words, it's hard to see why the students are so upset. After all, Wax's main contentions represent pretty formulaic conservative social theory. Wax worries about the impact of children born to unmarried couples, they fear the increasing use of opioids, and they lament the choice of some Americans to separate themselves from a unifying notion of patriotism. As they put it, "Get married before you have children and strive to stay married for their sake. Get the education you need for gainful employment, work hard, and avoid idleness. Go the extra mile for your employer or client. Be a patriot, ready to serve the country. Be neighborly, civic-minded, and charitable. Avoid coarse language in public. Be respectful of authority. Eschew substance abuse and crime."
Cry havoc, and let slip the armies of newspeak.
According to UPenn NGL, Wax's views are abhorrent because "white supremacy and cultural elitism are used to denigrate the poor and sustain and justify the gross wealth inequality that defines American capitalism." The NLG then offers a hilarious self-contradiction, "While we do not challenge Professor Wax's right to express their views, we question whether it is appropriate for them to continue to teach a required first-year course." UPenn, they demand, must consider "the toll that this takes on students, particularly students of color and members of the LGBTQIA* community, and to consider whether it is in the best interests of the school and its students for Professor Wax to continue to teach a required first-year class."
In one final victory for irony, the students explain that "Exposure to a diversity of viewpoints is an essential and valuable part of any educational experience, but no student should have to be exposed to bigotry or abuse in the classroom."
And no law student will ever face tough moments in the courtroom.
Not to worry, however, because the great guild "offer ourselves as a resource for first-year students in Professor Wax's class... whether you need someone just to listen, to help you figure out how to get through the semester, or to advocate on your behalf, Penn NLG has your back."
Here's another acronym: LOL.
Still, that's just the front line of the newspeak army. Other faculty members also wrote a boring letter complaining about Wax's views. And under the banner "hate crime", another group of professors claimed they support academic diversity but not Wax's arguments, which, they said, "do not deserve our respect. They are dehumanizing, inherently racist, and ultimately irrational."
The frenzy afoot, a number of other professors reframed Wax's argument as an attack on civil rights, even though they specifically praise the legacy of Martin Luther King. According to this group, "Nostalgia for a pre-civil right, pre-feminist golden age is just as compromised as other invocations of a glorious past, be it the Lost Cause, a City on a Hill, or any other historical myth."
Note the dripping disdain for a "City on the Hill." Here we see a hatred both for religion, the quote is derived from Matthew 5:14's reference to a community that brings inspiration to a people, and American idealism: many U.S. politicians including noted conservative, JFK, have used the term to reference American exceptionalism.
Yet again we see the activist Left's utter intolerance for alternative points of view. Instead of debate and introspection, they wallow in their intellectual cesspit.

Records obtained by The Dallas Morning News this week show that the district was first made aware of Woodward's work in the adult film industry after an anonymous tip on March 10. An internal review at the time cleared them of any policy violation.
Woodward said district officials told them then that they could continue teaching unless their previous career became public. That happened this fall.
“I taught in an all-girls STEAM academy that was all about empowerment for women,” Woodward said Tuesday. “The sad thing is that if these girls find out that I'm being punished for something that I did nearly 20 years ago and had no control of and fought to get out of, well, what does that say about empowerment?”
They added: “That involvement was not of my own choosing.”
Woodward said they were forced into pornography when they were living with an older man and they had financial troubles. They said they were able to leave the situation, finish school and become a teacher.
They tried to move on. Then a tip came to the district in March saying their film name was Robyn Foster.
A web-based adult film database lists Robyn Foster as active in the industry from 2001 to 2004 and associates that actor with 16 movies, including compilations of previously recorded material that was then released as recently as 2013.
“The caller was concerned because he/she did not want his/her child exposed to things like this,” according to the report. The tipster felt Woodward was trying to deceive the students and parents.
Kate Gorman Bauer, the district's director of Professional Standards, searched the internet and confirmed that Woodward was in numerous pornographic videos and photos. Initially, Woodward denied the allegations, then confirmed it was her, according to the district's investigation.
Woodward told district officials that activity stopped in 2001 and believed a man who knew them was retaliating against them by alerting the district, according to the report.
“I've been trying to live my life as far away as possible from this stuff for a long time,” they told officials, according to the report. They said no students, colleagues or supervisors were aware of their previous career.
Bauer closed the investigation on March 23, noting that “Woodward's past participation in pornography does not in itself constitute a policy violation.”
But Woodward's political activities last fall led to their outing, they said.
Woodward is a well-known activist in the Libertarian Party of Texas, where they serve as state membership coordinator and a district representative. They frequently contribute articles to various Libertarian-related websites.
Woodward said they wrote in a Facebook post last fall that they had to call police on a drunken driver while traveling. A man claiming they were associated with the Libertarian Party in another state became upset with that post because of their attitude toward police, they said. They then detailed their past on social media.
Woodward said they notified Dallas ISD officials of their post. They were placed on administrative leave in November.
“They told me they were pursuing termination because it became public,” they said.
Woodward said she's exploring options to fight their termination. They noted that they were praised as a teacher, earning recognition from Dallas ISD in merit pay increases for their work two years in a row.
They filed an appeal with the Texas Education Agency. But spokesperson DeEtta Culbertson said the agency wasn't assigning an independent hearing because the appeal was filed incorrectly.
Texas teachers must adhere to a code of ethics that require them to have “good moral character” and be “worthy to instruct or supervise the youth of this state.” Breaking that code can be grounds for termination.
However, districts have a lot of leeway in determining what that means, said Clay Robison, spokesperson for the Texas State Teachers Association.
“The district can claim that something a teacher does have undermined their ability to be effective as a teacher,” Robison said. “A teacher can fight it, but that usually involves significant costs.”
Woodward said they have worked in education for 15 years. State records show they previously worked in the McKinney school district before joining Dallas in 2012.
They took a year off from teaching to earn their master's degree in 2013, according to district records.
The government is ready to put evolution on the primary curriculum for the first time after years of lobbying by senior scientists.
The schools minister, Diana Johnson, has confirmed the plans will be included in a blueprint for a new curriculum to be published in the next few weeks.
It follows a letter signed by scientists and science educators calling on the government to make the change after draft versions of the new curriculum failed to mention evolution explicitly.
The open letter sent in July to Ed Balls, the children's secretary, was signed by 25 leading figures from science and education, who urged the government to rewrite the curriculum before it was finalised.
Among the signatories were the Oxford University evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins, three Nobel laureates and Reverend Professor Michael Reiss, the professor of science education at the Institute of Education in London.
The letter expressed alarm that the theory of evolution through natural selection, which it describes as "one of the most important ideas underlying biological science", was ignored in the revamped curriculum.
"We consider its inclusion vital," the letter said.
In a letter to the British Humanist Association (BHA), which has co-ordinated the campaign for evolution on the curriculum, Johnson confirmed it would be in the final draft. Pupils will start with simple concepts of change, adaptation and natural selection illustrated by the evolution of fish to amphibians to mammals, for example.
Andrew Copson, director of education at the BHA, said: "Evolution is arguably the most important concept underlying the life sciences. Providing children with an understanding of it an early age will help lay the foundations for a surer scientific understanding later on. I congratulate the government for taking on board the contributions from so many supporters of science education."
The government asked its primary school adviser, Sir Jim Rose, to overhaul the curriculum for four- to 11-year-olds last year. Their report in the spring set out widespread reforms to the curriculum.
It recommended stripping away the 11 subjects primaries must cover by law, and replacing them with six "areas of learning", including history, science and geography. In the next few weeks, the results of the consultation on Rose's plans will be published along with the government's response.
Copson said the teaching of evolution was particularly important in the wake of a recent survey commissioned by the British Council, which found that 54% of Britons agreed with the view that "evolutionary theories should be taught in science lessons in schools together with other possible perspectives, such as intelligent design and creationism".
Johnson said: "Learning about evolution is an important part of science education, and pupils already learn about it at secondary school.
"The draft primary curriculum was designed to cover evolution as an implicit part of the new programme of learning for science and technology. After a public consultation on the plans – which took in the views of parents, teachers, the public, subject experts and other interested parties – it is expected that evolution will be covered explicitly in the new primary curriculum. The responses from the consultation will be published shortly."
Put two texts together, and see what you see.
“God desires all people to be saved and to come to the knowledge of the truth (eis epignōsin alētheias)” (1 Timothy 2:4). “God may perhaps grant them repentance leading to a knowledge of the truth (eis epignōsin alētheias)” (2 Timothy 2:25).
Here's what I see:
1. Though God desires all people to be saved, they “may perhaps grant repentance.” Which I think means that God's desire for all to be saved does not lead them to save all. God has desires that do not reach the level of volition. They are restrained by other considerations — like their wisdom, which guides them to display their glory in the fullest way. They have their reasons for why they “may perhaps grant repentance” to some sinners, and not to others.
2. The “knowledge of the truth” is a gift of God. God “grants [i.e., gives] repentance leading to a knowledge of the truth.” Without the gift of repentance, we would not know the truth. This is evidently what 1 Timothy 2:4 means also: We must be “saved and [in that way] come to a knowledge of the truth.” Saved from our blindness to the truth.
3. Therefore the truth Paul has in mind is not truth that the natural man can see. But the natural man can see a lot of truth. Tens of thousands of truths are open to the natural mind. What truth can the natural man not see? The natural man cannot see the glory of Christ in the gospel. “The god of this world has blinded the minds of the unbelievers, to keep them from seeing the light of the gospel of the glory of Christ, who is the image of God” (2 Corinthians 4:4).
4. This is why God must “grant” what it takes to see the truth of the gospel. We are blind to it. And Satan keeps us that way. Until God “grants” repentance (metanoia) — the change of mind that can see and receive the truth of the gospel.
5. Therefore, our prayers for the unbelievers we love, and our evangelism, should be driven by this one and only hope for their salvation: “God may perhaps grant them repentance.” Since they alone has the power to overcome spiritual deadness and Satanic blindness, we lay hold in prayer and witness on the truth: “God may grant repentance.” That is our only hope.
So let us follow Paul: “Brothers, my heart's desire and prayer to God for them is that they may be saved” (Romans 10:1). And: “Faith comes from hearing, and hearing through the word of Christ” (Romans 10:17).
India has now decided to shortlist Dassault's Rafale and the Eurofighter's GmbH for its $12-billion dollar Medium Multiple Role Combat Aircraft, ostensibly on purely technical grounds. The losers in this initial round were the Swedish Gripen and two US-built aircraft, Boeing's F/A-18 Super Hornet and Lockheed's F-16 Super Viper. The Indian decision has been met with considerable dismay and disappointment in US defense circles. The disappointment is particularly great because US President Barack Obama while on a state visit to India last November had made a concerted pitch to Indian officials to persuade them to look to the United States.
There's little question, that at least in the short run, this decision will have some adverse consequences for the growing Indo-US relationship. This decision comes hard on the heels of a highly restrictive law dealing with foreign investment in India's nuclear industry. The passage of the nuclear legislation last year had already had more than a chilling impact on potential American investors in India's civilian nuclear power industry. In the wake of this move, two major US aerospace firms that had hoped to acquire a substantial presence in the Indian market have now been effectively removed from the fray.
It's too early to gauge the full impact of these two decisions on the course of Indo-US relations. Some Indian commentators have sought to minimize the potentially adverse fallout, arguing that the overall trajectory of the relationship is now on such a sound course that decisions of this order are unlikely to lead it into troubled waters. Such an assessment, though superficially reassuring, may prove to be overly rosey. Time will surely tell.
Britain's chief rabbi waded into the anti-Semitism row this week with an article in the Telegraph.: “Ken Livingstone and the hard left are spreading the insidious virus of anti-Semitism,” claimed Rabbi Ephraim Mirvis. In their strongly-worded article, they made a number of remarkable statements while trying to dispel what they described as “a myth that… has poisoned public discourse on anti-Semitism and Israel for decades.”
After telling readers that the likes of former London Mayor Ken Livingstone and NUS President-elect Malia Bouattia are unqualified to “provide an analysis of one of the axioms of Jewish belief”, Rabbi Mirvis asserted the authority of their position as head of one section of Britain's Jewish community to claim that “Zionism is a noble and integral part of Judaism.” Anyone suggesting otherwise, they insisted, is “deeply insulting to the Jewish community.”
Unlike their predecessors, who tended to keep their heads below the parapet regarding Palestine-Israel issues while in office, the chief rabbi since 2013 has made a number of vocals, and some would say sensational, public interventions in support of Israel. During their trip to Israel in 2014, they said: “Israel is central to our faith [I would like] Israel to feature more prominently in our synagogues and across our communities.”
At the beginning of 2016, during Israeli Apartheid Week — an annual programme of events that take place across 150 universities and cities in Britain and even more around the world — Rabbi Mirvis pointed out that they grew up in South Africa; this, apparently, gave them the moral authority to add, “So believe me when I say Israel is not an apartheid state.” Israel, of course, was a great friend of Apartheid South Africa and, as a “white”, the young Ephraim Mirvis would very likely have had the privileges such status conferred. They thus may well be equally dismissive of those in the South African anti-Apartheid movement, like Archbishop Desmond Tutu, who maintain that Israel is indeed an apartheid state or, in the words of ANC chair Baleka Mbete, “far worse than apartheid South Africa”. No doubt the chief rabbi is equally dismissive of the increasing number of liberal and ultra-orthodox Jews who share the views of the anti-Apartheid movement.
Rabbi Mirvis also came under fire from members of the Jewish community for populist comments that one might normally associate with the newly-appointed Israeli ambassador in London and former mouthpiece for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Australian-born Mark Regev. The chief rabbi used a sermon to thunder that, “Jews respect human life, unlike Palestinians.” This produced a critical response from British writer Robert Cohen, who told him, “Your sermon on Palestinian violence failed tests of moral and communal leadership.”
Cohen wrote their article after Rabbi Mirvis spoke about “the healing of relationships” and mentioned the latest uprising in Palestine. They reminded their listeners of the overwhelming sympathy felt by the British media and the public over the murder of Fusilier Lee Rigby in 2013. They then asked everyone to imagine what the public mood would be if such horrific murder was to become a daily occurrence up and down the country.
In one fell swoop they portrayed the current uprising against Israel's military occupation of Palestine as the work of militant jihadists while playing on the emotions of the British public with reference to Rigby's murder. This was not only gratuitous but also epitomised the dark sophistry of Israeli propaganda. It was also, wrote Cohen, a “gross distortion of the situation in Israel.” Stunned by the chief rabbi's inability to grasp the fact that there is a direct relationship between Israel's brutal treatment of Palestinians and the latest uprising they mocked their entire framing of the conflict: “This is the narrative that boils the entire 100-plus years of Palestinian/Jewish conflict down to: they hate us.” [Emphasis added.]
Given their routine, over-zealous defence of Israel, we shouldn't be surprised by Rabbi Mirvis's “anti-Semitism” intervention.  They are rooted firmly in the politics of Israeli right-wing rejectionists. In fact, they appear to be an apologist for Israel's cruelty. The swift manner by which one Israeli newspaper dismissed the notion of a minor disagreement between Britain's chief rabbi and Netanyahu is extremely revealing; their politics are less about “the healing of relationships” and more about maintaining Israel's firm grip over occupied Palestinian territory.
Furthermore, Rabbi Mirvis's self-assumed authority to speak on this matter dispassionately should not be taken at face-value; indeed, their comments should be treated with suspicion. This is not only because of their track record in defending Israel's indefensible actions, but also because no political concept should be beyond public scrutiny. “Zionism,” asserts the chief rabbi, “is a belief in the right to Jewish self-determination in a land that has been at the centre of the Jewish world for more than 3,000 years.” Questioning this hypothesis, though, has got to be no more anti-Semitic than questioning the idea of Muslim self-determination is Islamophobic.
The post-colonial creation of dozens of Muslim-majority countries, some Muslims would argue, is not an authentic manifestation of Muslim self-determination. True and genuine self-determination by Muslims, they maintain, would see the creation of an Islamic state. Muslims from around the world would find a safe-haven in this “self-determined” state; their national background — be it British or Burmese; Syrian or South African; Palestinian or Pakistani — would not prevent them from being granted citizenship. Using the chief rabbi's argument that criticism of Zionism is “anti-Semitic”, it is, therefore, reasonable to say that criticism of Muslim self-determination is Islamophobic, ergo the entire crusade against political Islam is Islamophobic and should be off-limits. Although some might claim that it should be treated as such, no reasonable person would, as no political ideology should be beyond scrutiny, including Zionism. It is, frankly, ludicrous to equate criticism of a political ideology like Zionism with anti-Semitism.
The chief rabbi's attempt to re-write history won't stick. They quite probably believes that their intervention will be the final word in the debate about anti-Zionism and anti-Semitism, but that is very unlikely. In the real world, Jewish voices have been split over political Zionism and where it stands in relation to the ancient religion of Judaism. The hard truth is that political ideologies emerge out of a historical context and Zionism is rooted in European nationalism more than Judaism. Its critics would argue that the most pernicious elements of Zionism come out of the most extreme forms of nationalism.
The ideas espoused by Zionists in the late nineteenth century formed a minority view amongst Jews. Its distortion of Judaic teachings led many orthodox rabbis to condemn Zionism's key tenets. In their book “The Origins of Zionism” (Oxford University Press, 1980), David Vital notes that, “Shortly before the 1897 [Zionist] Congress in Basle the German Rabbinate formally and publicly condemned the ‘efforts of the so-called Zionists to create a Jewish national State in Palestine' as contrary to the divine law. The rabbis called upon all those committed to the interest of Judaism to distance themselves from Political Zionism and the impending Congress organised by Theodor Herzl.”
In “Politics and Divine Promise”, author K. Harmann writes about the former Chief Rabbi of Vienna, Dr Moritz Gudemann (1835-1918), who also expressed similar reservations about the “worldly” nature of political Zionism. In their monograph titled “National-Judenthum” (National Judaism, 1897) Dr Gudemann made a scathing attack on the aims and programmes of the Zionist movement. “True Zionism,” they wrote, “was not separable from the future of humanity.” On the contrary, it was closely connected to the ethical perfection and brotherhood of all humankind. The future of the Jewish people, they insisted, was not dependent upon “our national restoration in Palestine, with all the requirements of state sovereignty.”
Critics of Zionism amongst the rabbinical class were not exclusively from Europe. In Jerusalem, the Rabbi of Brisk, Joseph Hayyim Sonnenfeldt (1848-1932), expressed similar condemnation of political Zionism: “As to the Zionists, what shall I say and what am I to speak? There is great dismay also in the Holy Land that these evil men who deny the Unique one of the world and Their holy Torah have proclaimed with so much publicity that it is in their hands to hasten redemption for the people of Israel and gather the dispersed from the ends of the earth. They have also asserted their view, that the whole difference and distinction between Israel and the nations lies in nationalism, blood and race; and that the faith and the religion are superfluous.”
The conflation of anti-Zionism with anti-Semitism is, though, a long-standing strategy of Israeli politics. In their response to this very question (Is anti-Zionism anti-Semitism?), Noam Chomsky said that it is certainly not the case. They cited an article by Abba Eban, Israel's Foreign Minister from 1966 to 1974, in which they advised the Jewish community to undertake two tasks: one was to equate criticism of Israeli policies with anti-Semitism, and the other was to marginalise Jewish voices critical of Israel as “self-hating” Jews. It is clearly a political tactic to achieve political, not religious, objectives.
It would seem that Britain's chief rabbi has fallen victim to this propaganda. In doing so, I would, respectfully, suggest that they have compromised the moral and ethical teachings of the Jewish faith for the political expediency of the Zionist state of Israel.

Perfecting the Flow State Before Fighting.
Perfection Sparring for the Mind and Body.
Fight week is a critical time period. You want to stay sharp, focused, and in top physical shape, but you also have to leave time for your body to recover in order to compete in peak form.
Here is a pre fight ritual Namsaknoi [One of the greatest fighters and trainers of all time] uses as a tactic to keep their fighters sharp, stimulated, confident; all without the high risk of injury or over training just days before the fight. Some need this type of training to calm their nerves or their need to move, some need it to stick to the game plan.
To me it is something that puts me in a “flow state” right before the fight. This combination of sparring, drilling and coaching is stimulating enough to keep you sharp and focused, but not overwhelming to the point of breaking down your confidence or giving you too much all at once [especially right before a night that already holds its own sources of pressure].
Namsaknoi enables me to flow my techniques and combinations, but if they feel that there is an opening they will quickly make me aware with a counter. If it's something that needs an extra bit of work or tightening up, they will drill it with me, but quickly break that rhythm once again when they are pleased with my adjustments. We do this twice in one day, two days before each fight:

A dance card [1] or programme du bal (also known by its German-language name, Tanzkarte) is used by a woman to record the names of the gentlemen with whom they intend to dance each successive dance at a formal ball.
They appear to have originated in the 18th century, but their use first became widespread in 19th century Vienna, especially at the massive balls during Fasching before Lent. According to the Oxford English Dictionary, the first published use of the term in English was in 1892.
Dance engagements card for 11 January 1887, showing a list of all the dances for the evening - valse, polka, lancers and quadrille; opposite each dance is a space to record the name of the partner for that dance. After the event the card was probably kept as a souvenir of the evening
An actual dance card is typically a booklet with a decorative cover, listing dance titles, composers, and the person with whom the woman intended to dance. Typically, it would have a cover indicating the sponsoring organization of the ball and a decorative cord by which it could be attached to a lady's wrist or ball gown. From the 19th century until World War I, dance cards for the elite of Austria-Hungary were often very elaborate, with some even incorporating precious metals and jewels.
In modern times the expression "dance card" is often used metaphorically, as when someone says "pencil me into your dance card," meaning "find some time to spend with me". Conversely, someone's "dance card is full" implies that even though they may be interested, they have no time for another person.
U.S. Air Force aircrews in general, and those involved in flight tests in particular, use the term to describe the first card in a "deck" of flight or test maneuver cards. The "dance card" contains administrative data about the mission, aircraft, and aircrew as well as a list of the maneuvers to be flown. The card serves as a table of contents for the mission and a quick reference for the aircrew's use during the flight.

The Republican Party is on a suicide mission. The disdain and contempt the Republican establishment is showing Donald Trump and their supporters is unprecedented. Republicans at the highest level and their advisers have called Trump supporters racists, woman haters, uneducated and losers. These are the same politicians who've been unable to utter an unkind word toward Barack Obama, a man who has actively undermined law enforcement, the military and our national security.
The Republican Party has made it clear it will bend and break the rules, beg, borrow and steal to keep Trump from getting its nomination. What's behind all this? Two things: open borders/illegal immigration and free trade/globalization. Open borders and free trade have padded the wallets of corporate Americans and Republicans while also leading to the demise of the American middle class. And Trump is on the side of the middle class on these issues.
Party elites have pushed one pathetic, traitorous open-border candidate after another onto the electorate. Jeb Bush, open borders all the way. Marco Rubio, open borders plus a big supporter of H1-B Visas. Ohio Gov. John Kasich has proclaimed they will wave their magic wand and make all illegal aliens legal within 100 days of becoming president. And now House Speaker Paul Ryan, probably the worst of the bunch, is a man who believes that anyone who wants to live in the U.S. should be free to show up. A man who, along with empty suit Mitt Romney, could not win their home state of Wisconsin or even their hometown of Janesville in the last presidential election against a very unpopular incumbent. But Republican voters, especially middle-class grassroots voters, to their credit, are not buying what the party is selling.
If Republican bosses steal this nomination from Trump, it's safe to say their supporters will not simply roll over and support one of these open-border traitors. Their voters will stay home or support Trump as an independent candidate. Either way, Hillary Clinton, if she's not in prison, will be the next president of the U.S. Sad thing is, Republican bosses, along with the donors and lobbyists who call the shots, don't really care who's sitting in the Oval Office as long as they have access to cheap labor and free-trade policies. But there may be a silver lining here.
With all the support Bernie Sanders is getting on the Democrat side, it's pretty clear folks on the left aren't too thrilled with the status quo either. Perhaps a legitimate third party can emerge from all this, a populist/nationalist party that puts American taxpayers ahead of special interests. I'd call it the America First Party. Just a fantasy? Hopefully not.
Wright-Phillips added a second goal early in the second half, and the Red Bulls prevailed despite playing most of the match with 10 men after Matt Miazga was sent off in the first half.
June 28, 2015, Yankee Stadium: Red Bulls 3, N.Y.C.F.C. 1
The second meeting, this time in the Bronx, felt like a moment when things might change. N.Y.C.F.C. entered on a three-game winning streak, and an early goal by Tommy McNamara and glimpses of the new signing Andrea Pirlo in a luxury box with Frank Lampard had the home fans giddy.
And then it all went wrong: The Red Bulls scored three times in the second half and coasted to victory. “I don't think we got a real, honest effort out of all of our players,” N.Y.C.F.C. Coach Jason Kreis grumbled afterward.
Aug. 9, 2015, Red Bull Arena: Red Bulls 2, N.Y.C.F.C. 0
By the time the teams met for the final time last season, the difference between the franchises was clear: The Red Bulls were steaming toward a playoff spot, and N.Y.C.F.C. was struggling to find itself but also to blend the midseason acquisitions Pirlo and Lampard into a team that did not always seem as if it knew what it was doing.
The response to these struggles at Red Bull Arena was mockery, in the form of a giant banner raised minutes before kickoff. On it the Red Bulls' hard-core supporters had painted the images of Lampard, then 37, and Pirlo, then 36, resting on canes below the label “City Retirement Home.” A sluggish effort did little to push back against the message, and the season sweep was complete.
May 21, 2016, Yankee Stadium: Red Bulls 7, N.Y.C.F.C. 0
Kreis was fired after last season and replaced by Vieira, but Vieira's first taste of the rivalry is surely one they would like to forget. Dax McCarty lost their man to score a header off a corner kick in the third minute, and when N.Y.C.F.C. did not learn its lesson, they repeated the feat in the second half. Wright-Phillips scored twice — giving them goals in every meeting in the rivalry — in what became the biggest victory in M.L.S. in 15 years.
Even the long-awaited debut of Lampard was greeted with boos. Vieira tried to be philosophical — “It's always better to lose one game, 7-0, than seven games, 1-0” — but the final score line clearly stung their pride. “From the first minute to the last one, we didn't play at all,” they said.
Introducing 0x
An Open Protocol For Decentralized Exchange On The Ethereum Blockchain
Amir Bandeali Blocked Unblock Follow Feb 22, 2017
Today we are excited to announce our project, 0x, and we are releasing our whitepaper for the community to review.
0x is an open protocol that facilitates low friction peer-to-peer exchange of ERC20 tokens on the Ethereum blockchain. The protocol is intended to serve as an open standard and common building block, driving interoperability among decentralized applications (dApps) that incorporate exchange functionality. Trades are executed by a system of Ethereum smart contracts that are publicly accessible, free to use and that any dApp can hook into. DApps built on top of the protocol can access public liquidity pools or create their own liquidity pool and charge transaction fees on the resulting volume. The protocol does not impose costs on its users or arbitrarily extract value from one group of users to benefit another. Decentralized governance is used to continuously and securely integrate updates into the base protocol without disrupting higher level processes.
Numerous decentralized exchanges have been built on the Ethereum blockchain. However, they are all proprietary and incompatible with each other. 0x is not a decentralized exchange, it is a protocol for exchange. Our mission is to drive standardization and widespread adoption of the protocol, leading to safer smart contracts and a global liquidity pool.
Standardization, Decoupling, and Interoperability
Standardization benefits the entire ecosystem because it creates interoperability between dApps, creating synergies and driving network effects. 0x enables interoperability by pulling exchange functionality from the application layer into the protocol layer. It will serve as a modular building block that, when built upon, can be assembled into increasingly complex and useful applications. In this case, interoperability should yield the one thing that current decentralized exchanges are lacking most: liquidity. Liquid markets are a key piece of infrastructure necessary for the success of the token economy, and will grow in importance as more and more assets become tokenized.
Moving Forward
We will be releasing more information soon, including our roadmap, timeline and some exciting partnerships. We welcome feedback from the community and are open to collaborations, so feel free to reach out!
Last Friday evening we had some time to kill before an art opening and decided to wander around Station North for a bite to eat. I'd heard about this french place that was new and wanted to check out. So we wandered over to Colette, which is right in between two other exceptional restaurants so please don't overlook it.
The wait for a table was over an hour but there was ample seating in the bar area, really not a bad seat in the house. It's not often that I will make a big deal about this, but we loved our waiter. They were friendly and knowledgeable. The best part was them going around to everyone in the bar right before the end of Happy Hour to make sure we all got some drinks before the price went up. That gets an A++ in my book. The first drink I ordered was the Sir Barton. I had been excited about it ever since they announced their Preakness inspired drink menu. They shared the recipe for the Sir Barton and I've been having my husband make it for me at home. I won't say how often. I'm happy to say I was not disappointed with the Sir Barton I was served at Colette and as you can see they have the big square ice, bonus! I broke the rules with it though, by not ordering off the Happy Hour menu, for shame.
For my next drink I had whatever the Happy Hour red was and we put in our order for some sharables. The women next to us raved about the Gruyere Beignets when we first arrived so I decided to give them a shot. The hype was well deserved. The Gruyere Beignets served with honey, chives, and sea salt are both savory and sweet. I really can't think of a more perfect bite. I'm sitting here salivating as I type. I miss them, I need them. Thank you random ladies at the bar.
The other appetizer we ordered was the Steak Tartare made with ramp mayonnaise, cured egg yolk, and horseradish. If you haven't noticed the theme yet, I almost always order the tartare when we go somewhere new. I think it says a lot about a restaurant if they are able to pull off a good tartare. This was definitely up to par with the tartare I've had at other highly rated restaurants in the city. I really liked the addition of horseradish to the dish, it gives it some bite.
For my main course I ordered the Morel and Wild Mushroom Stew with fiddlehead ferns, madeira, and ricotta dumplings. I know it was like 100 degrees that day and thick with humidity, but morels. I had to get the stew. It was worth being slightly uncomfortable eating a hot stew on a hot day though. Luckily the air in the bar was blowing on me. The stew was very rich and salty. The ricotta dumplings cut through and added a sweet creaminess. In a dish that would normally be very mushy, the fiddlehead ferns gave it some much-needed crunch.
Mr. Meat and Potatoes continued on their duck quest. They ordered the Pan Seared Duck Breast with sweet potato, mustard greens, and sherried blueberries. Their duck was awesome. It had a crispy skin and was cooked to a perfect medium rare. The sweet potato and mustard greens complemented the saltiness of the accompanying sauce. The blueberries were the sweet accent you always want when eating duck. I had a taste and I have to say that was one of the best sweet potatoes I've ever had.
We finished off our meal with a shared dessert. My food was way too heavy to eat a dessert on my own. We went with the Milk and Honey Pot de Creme with lavender shortbread. While most may not be, I'm a big fan of lavender in food, especially dessert. If there is lavender on the menu I'll order it because it's not an easy foot to create a lavender dish that works. Colette went above and beyond my expectations. The creme was fluffy and sweet and the lavender sprinkled on top was just the right amount. You don't want an overpowering amount of lavender in your mouth, this was just right.
I most certainly am I making another trip back to Colette. It's perfect for a 3-course meal and also for sharing several small plates. We've done the courses, next time I want to do order lots of small bites. Basically, I need to try everything on their menu, but I think I'll have a hard time not ordering the beignets every time we go and my husband just told me they are ordering the duck every time no matter what. It sounds like we will have to go back a lot and that is not a bad thing.

Today, Facebook is releasing its Zstandard compression algorithm into the wild as open source. The lossless compression technology is aimed at replacing existing libraries like zlib that are powered by the outdated Deflate compression algorithm. In addition to Zstandard, Facebook is also dropping its MyRocks storage engine as open source. MyRocks is currently being used by Facebook to improve the storage efficiency of its MySQL databases.
Both releases occurred in coordination with Facebook's @Scale conference in San Jose. The conference supports engineers working to solve large-scale engineering challenges by bringing them together, side-by-side, with other companies in the industry dedicated to increasing the prevalence of open-source technology. Both Zstandard and MyRocks will enable developers to build platforms that can efficiently scale to large and diverse user bases.
One of the greatest fears of engineers looking to update and replace critical infrastructure is that the new libraries could bring an entire service down. Jay Parikh, vice president of infrastructure engineering at Facebook, is proud of the fact that both Zstandard and MyRocks were tested at scale across the company before being released to the community.
“Everyone here uses all of the products,” added Parikh.
In the six months that Facebook has been testing Zstandard, the company noted impressive results. With the same compression ratio of zlib, Zstandard was five times faster. In a case where the compression time was held constant, files were 10 percent smaller.
MyRocks has also produced some serious storage efficiencies. When compared to compressed InnoDB, MyRocks was able to store the same amount of data on half the server space.
“Making it open source makes the community better,” added Parikh. “It will be adopted more quickly as open source than had if was created as the proprietary technology of a single company.”
Facebook hopes that their open source solutions can become new industry standards.
Coming off a U.S. Open Cup victory and the franchise's first Supporters' Shield, it should probably not come as a huge surprise that the Seattle Sounders have opened contract extension talks with head coach Sigi Schmid. Sounders GM and part owner Adrian Hanauer confirmed this today, adding that they felt Schmid is worthy of MLS Coach of the Year honors.
"He's shown once again that changes can occur, that older dogs can learn new tricks," Hanauer said. "He's open to new ideas. They can be a little bit of a stubborn German like myself or [assistant coach Brian] Schmetzer or a bunch of the other Germans here, but their quality and their breadth of skill set in the MLS environment is to me top of the heap in our league.
"So: yes and yes. We're speaking with Sigi at this point and very enthusiastic and encouraged about the prospect of retaining them for more years."
Speaking to Sounder at Heart for an interview that will air on Wednesday's Nos Audietis, Schmid suggested he's hopeful that this will actually be their final coaching job. The 61-year-old has now been with the Sounders six years -- longer than anywhere he's been since leaving UCLA in 1999 -- and any contract extension would probably keep them here at least another three or four years.
"I'd like to end my coaching career here," Schmid said. "I don't know if that's possible, but that's what I'd love to do. I'd like to be connected with this club even after my coaching ends, whether that's scouting or helping somewhere -- maybe I'll go back to my business days -- whatever I could do.
"There's part of me that says I should pass it on, but I love being with the team, I love being on the field. I love the challenge of the week to week and trying to fix things. It's still exciting and exhilerating and fun. If they'll have me, I'll stay, but they need to want to have me."
All indications are that the Sounders do, but both sides are likely waiting to finalize anything until after the MLS Cup playoffs. If the Sounders go on to win MLS Cup, they'll be the first MLS team to accomplish the treble. As it is, they are one of only eight teams to win at least two parts of that honor
BATH — Roy Ordway's routine trip to the gas station and the hardware on Monday store took a surreal turn as they were driving on Vine Street and heard what sounded like ice falling from the Route 1 viaduct above him.
What they heard wasn't ice, but pieces of an aluminum guardrail that were quickly followed by an SUV that plummeted 30 feet off the elevated roadway and landed – upside down – in the back of Ordway's Ford F-150 pickup.
Roy Ordway's pickup is hooked to a tow truck after the crash. They didn't mind the damage – they were planning to buy a van. A Mercury Mountaineer rests on its roof after being removed from the truck bed. The occupants, Melissa Medina of Windham and their 12-year-old son, survived the accident.
“I guess I saw something coming from above,” Ordway said. “I laid down (across) the seat. I guess I knew it was gonna hit.”
The cab of Ordway's truck was largely untouched, and they were shaken but unharmed.
“The only thing that I remember, honestly, is getting out of my truck and looking back and seeing a car in the back of it,” the longtime maintenance man recalled Tuesday. “And I guess I reached in and turned the key off because I figured I wasn't going anywhere.”
Incredibly, the occupants of the Mercury Mountaineer, Melissa Medina of Windham and their 12-year-old son, survived the crash.
Medina was in fair condition Tuesday at Maine Medical Center, hospital officials said. They declined to provide their son's condition, but in a brief phone interview Tuesday afternoon, Jason Medina, Melissa's husband, said their wife and son are doing OK. Their wife was expected to have their jaw wired shut during surgery Tuesday night, they said.
“They're both doing well,” they said. “They have a long road ahead of them.”
Road conditions on the viaduct were slick and icy at the time of the accident because of the snow, said Bath Police Lt. Robert Savary. Medina, who was heading south, was likely traveling at or close to the speed limit, which is 35 mph.
“I don't think excessive speed is going to be a factor, more than the road conditions,” Savary said. Alcohol doesn't appear to be a factor in the crash, police said.
Ordway doesn't remember many details, but said fire crews and police arrived quickly and got to work separating the two vehicles and extracting Medina and their son.
“I don't know if I had my foot on the brake or on the gas,” they said of what happened when they heard the noises above them as they drove on Vine Street. “It's kind of strange, to be honest.”
Ordway is pleased that no one was killed, and suggested that their truck's suspension, which is designed to take a heavy load, may have cushioned the vehicle's fall.
“I'm glad it worked out the way it did,” they said. “Falling that far off, then hitting the pavement, it could have been worse.”
The entire ordeal was still settling in, Ordway said.
“I didn't sleep so well last night, honestly, and I realize how lucky I am,” they said. “Just a few seconds either way, if I'd been a few seconds slower or a few seconds faster, the outcome could have been quite different for either vehicle.”
The truck is likely a total loss. Although the cab was nearly untouched, the rear half, including the bed, was flattened by the impact.
Ordway isn't concerned about their vehicle – they aren't attached to it and was planning to buy a van.
Fire crews had to use heavy equipment to cut Medina and their son from the SUV, which was totaled. It was moved to a wrecking yard, blood still staining the vehicle's roof.
On Tuesday, yellow safety barrels blocked off the section of guardrail that was damaged in the crash along a narrow, elevated section of road where there is virtually no shoulder or run-off area.
The Maine Department of Transportation has repaired the guardrail on the viaduct before, but a car has never crashed through it and fallen off the bridge, Chief Engineer Joyce Taylor told WCSH-TV on Tuesday.
“This is a first for me, to have a car actually go through a bridge railing and actually come off the bridge,” Taylor said. “It's pretty rare.”
They said the department inspected the scene Monday night and found the posts were bolted down, but the car's impact had sheared them off.
MDOT had inspected the bridge in January and found no major issues, they said.
“Something different happened here. I don't know what that is yet, but I don't think this railing could withstand that angle and level of force that happened,” Taylor said.
The quarter-mile bridge opened in 1958, and is scheduled to be replaced this year in a $15 million project that will go into full swing in October. More than 18,000 vehicles travel the road each day.

According to Public Policy Polling, a Democratic polling institution, 53% of viewers thought Barack Obama won tonight's third debate on foreign policy; 42% thought Romney won. Going in, 51% were planning to vote for Obama, as opposed to 45% for Romney. Surprisingly, Obama led Romney by a mere 51% to 47% margin on the issue of foreign policy among those Democratic-leaning voters.
But among independents, the numbers moved heavily toward Romney. While 55% of independents said Obama won the debate, a full 48% of the independents said they were less likely to vote Obama after the debate. 47% of independents said they were more likely to vote Romney.
There can be only one possible explanation for these numbers. While the public thought Obama won the debate, they didn't like how they won it. They felt they were arrogant and dismissive. And they felt more comfortable with Mitt Romney as a human being – they looked presidential. That means that the Romney strategy worked last night.
The fall of the last bastion of free speech in Venezuela
For years, Venezuela's government has dodged accusations that it does not protect freedom of speech. Critics usually point to the frequent use of public airwaves to broadcast government propaganda, as well as the many TV and radio stations the government has shut down for playing critical content. The government usually responds by citing the continued operation of Globovisión, a sharply critical all-news station (or rather, the only critical news station). Chavistas claim that its survival throughout the Chávez era refutes any allegations of censorship.
But the government will have to find another weak alibi. As of the last few days, Globovisión's critical presentation of the news feels like a thing of the past.
Last March, Globovisión's owners announced that the station had been sold to a group of Venezuelan business people linked to the insurance industry. The decision made sense both economically and politically. Globovisión has been under siege for years by being routinely fined for covering news that regulators felt would "stir public anxiety." Because of their work, Globovisión's owners and journalists are also under constant threats of being arrested.
The standoff between the government and Globovisión goes back to 2001. Back then, most of the Venezuelan media took a harshly critical stance toward President Hugo Chávez's early efforts to establish what they called a "socialist republic." After losing several battles, stations such as Venevisión and Televen backed down and began self-censoring. Radio Caracas Television was shut down after the government refused to renew its license. The small-ish Globovisión, Venezuela's main private all-news channel, remained unapologetically critical and correspondingly experienced significant growth in its ratings. While it presented itself as a news network, its programming was loaded with opinion shows that mostly promoted the opposition's point of view.
The existence of critical news stations, however, does not exactly give credence to the government's claims that all of the media are against it. The Committee to Protect Journalists and Reporters Without Borders have both cited Globovisión as the only remaining critical TV station in the country, pointing out that more than 50 percent of news media outlets are favorable to the government. NGOs such as Human Rights Watch concluded that "[w]hile sharp criticism of the government is still common in the print media, on the private TV station Globovisión, and in some other outlets, fear of government reprisals has made self-censorship a serious problem."
But judging by the actions of Globovisión's new owners, the station is now preparing to give up its role as the last line of defense for free speech. Several well-known journalists have either resigned or lost their jobs (such as Kico Bautista shown above) because of differences with the new owners. Following a decision to ban live video of opposition leader Henrique Capriles, the governor of Miranda state took to Twitter to denounce apparent links between the station's new owners and members of the ruling clique. Massive numbers of Twitter followers began "un-following" the station. This prompted a furious communiqué from the owners in which they vowed to prevent the station from acting "like a political party," a talking point typically used by high-ranking chavistas when criticizing the station.
These moves come at a time when the Maduro administration is dominating the airwaves with mandatory broadcasts even as their popularity is tanking. Venezuelans are suffering through severe shortages of everything from corn flour to toilet paper, and this seems to be hurting the government's image.
Globovisión's demise is one of several worrying trends in Venezuela's public sphere. After criticizing chavista strongman Diosdado Cabello for corruption, the state TV channel VTV decided to bench their own chavista talking head, Mario Silva, and cancel their long-running show, La Hojilla ("The Razorblade"). Now, Maduro has been talking about going after cable TV. Among their targets is CNN, which, they say, is conspiring against their government by engaging in "psychological warfare" and by plotting a coup.
A few years ago, the Chávez administration began working toward what they call "communication hegemony." With these latest moves, it seems as if the goal is within reach. But if the government succeeds, it will soon find itself facing a new problem. When all the critics are gone, officials will no longer have anyone to blame for "media conspiracies" and other such nonsense.
At any rate, Venezuelans really don't need their TV news to tell them there is no toilet paper on the supermarket shelves. It's this grim reality that's the real enemy of the government — and that's one case where censorship isn't going to help.

Donald Rizer doesn't know it, but I put everything I had into electing President Obama so that Mr. Rizer could have access to affordable health care. And they would have it, as Kevin Drum points out, if not for Bush-appointed Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts, Georgia Governor Nathan Deal, and the Republican-led Georgia legislature.
Donald Rizer is a 58 year old man with an aching shoulder that limits how much they can work. And they just lost their job that was paying them only about $800 a month. The cheapest health care plan they can find on the federal exchange is $200 a month, which they clearly cannot afford.
They blame the president.
“Obama,” they said, “he thinks that he's helping things, but they ain't.”
The Affordable Care and Patient Protection Act, as written, would have provided 100% of the money needed for the state of Georgia to put Mr. Rizer on Medicaid, and they could have gone and had a doctor take a look at that shoulder. If they made a little more money, the law, as written, would have given Mr. Rizer a subsidy to buy that $200/mo. plan, leaving them to pay no more than 2% of their income. We're talking about a bill that would probably be less than $30 a month.
But Chief Justice John Roberts ruled that the states cannot be compelled to expand Medicaid. And Gov. Nathan Deal decided that they wouldn't accept free money to expand Medicaid. And the Georgia legislature was just fine with that, even though it means that they'll have a much harder to time making ends meet and balancing their budget.
Finally, if Mr. Rizer wants to complain about the workability of HealthCare.gov, they can blame Georgian Republicans for that, too, because they wouldn't have to use it if their own state government had agreed to set up their own exchange.
Donald Rizer is angry, but their anger is misplaced. Rather than complaining about the president who tried to help him, they should be angry with the people who prevented them from being helped.

The gap between the wealthiest Americans and middle- and working-class Americans has more than tripled in the past three decades, according to a June 25 report by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.
New data show that the gaps in after-tax income between the richest 1 percent of Americans and the middle and poorest parts of the population in 2007 was the highest it's been in 80 years, while the share of income going to the middle one-fifth of Americans shrank to its lowest level ever.
The CBPP report attributes the widening of this gap partly to Bush Administration tax cuts, which primarily benefited the wealthy. Of the $1.7 trillion in tax cuts taxpayers received through 2008, high-income households received by far the largest -- not only in amount but also as a percentage of income -- which shifted the concentration of after-tax income toward the top of the spectrum.
The average household in the top 1 percent earned $1.3 million after taxes in 2007, up $88,800 just from the prior year, while the income of the average middle-income household hovered around $55,300. While the nation's total income has grown sharply since 1979, according to the CBPP report, the wealthiest households have claimed an increasingly large share of the pie.
Arloc Sherman, a researcher for CBPP, said the income gap is expanding not because the middle class is losing income, but because the wealthiest incomes are skyrocketing.
"If income growth had been shared equally among all income groups, the families at the bottom would have $6,000 per year more than they do now, and the middle would have $13,000 more," they said.
Sherman said one key to closing the gap is a responsible tax policy.
"It would be a big step in the wrong direction to enact proposals like a big rollback in the taxes on the wealthiest estates," Sherman said. "It would probably help to enact some of the middle class tax extender proposals advanced by the President and the Democrats, including things like the extension of the expanded child tax credit."
The CBPP data do not show the effect of the recession that began in December 2007, but economists say that the recession has probably reduced the income gap only temporarily due to the severe drop in the stock market.
The single most important revelation in the WikiLeaks files on Afghanistan is the real story of war.
So said WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange when the website published nearly 92,000 U.S. military documents regarding the conflict in Afghanistan – and Pakistan – last July.
“It's one damn thing after another. It's the continuous small events, the continuous deaths of children, insurgents, armed forces,” they said, calling it the “everyday squalor of war.”
That was a profound observation. War is dehumanizing. It is the opposite of what humans are as social beings. It dehumanizes soldiers as well as civilians.
The New York Times ran recently ran a front page story on a U.S. Army unit charged with killing Afghan civilians for sport. There are 70 photographs of soldiers posing with their “kill.” Investigators said soldiers collected and carried around body parts of their victims.
The unit allegedly used drugs. One soldier told investigators they smoked hashish on “bad days, stressful days, days that we just needed to escape.”
In other words, all the time. To numb the horror? To numb the pain? To become inhuman to just survive?
It reminds us of the U.S. war in Vietnam some 45 years ago.
There are alternatives
The United States invaded Afghanistan nine years ago on Oct. 7, after the terrorist attacks on our country on Sept. 11, 2001. At that time, the American people did not know that the Pentagon and the George W. Bush administration saw Afghanistan more as a dress-rehearsal for an Iraq invasion than a police action to “get al Qaeda and Osama bin Laden.” Bush and the neoconservatives seized 9/11 as their opportunity to reshape the Middle East and Central Asia under U.S. economic and military control. That goal had nothing to do with bringing the 9/11 criminals to justice.
During that terrible autumn of 2001, journalist Walter Cronkite had the foresight to caution, on the David Letterman show, against a military invasion, which they feared could be a “bottomless hole” with many losses of Afghan and American soldiers' lives.
Cronkite said they believed in “retribution” for the heinous 9/11 crime, but said there is a “body of opinion” that military action is the wrong way to go about fighting terrorism.
Events have proved them correct. Since then we've seen the growth of terrorist networks in a variety of countries, and the U.S. bogged down in a disastrous Afghanistan quagmire.
Searching for an exit strategy
Now we are two years into President Obama's command of the U.S. wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. They made good on two campaigns promises: begin withdrawal from Iraq and focus on Afghanistan.
Obama – under tremendous pressure from the Pentagon – ordered a troop surge in Afghanistan, disappointing and angering many opponents of the war.
Now Afghanistan is called Obama's war.
In their new book, “Obama's Wars,” journalist Bob Woodward reports that President Obama wanted an exit strategy from Afghanistan, but the generals did not provide one. So Obama was unable to present one, but they set a withdrawal timetable, knowing their political base wouldn't stand for more of Bush's endless wars.
Military-industrial complex
In their famous 1961 “military-industrial complex” speech, President Dwight Eisenhower warned of a dangerous new development in our country. The “conjunction of an immense military establishment and a large arms industry is new in the American experience,” they said.
“The total influence – economic, political, even spiritual – is felt in every city, every state house, every office of the federal government. We recognize the imperative need for this development. Yet we must not fail to comprehend its grave implications. Our toil, resources and livelihood are all involved; so is the very structure of our society.”
The military-industrial complex – which includes big energy/oil interests and the extreme right wing – have had plenty of time and money to thoroughly embed themselves in America's economy, politics, government and society. They make billions in profits a year from the armaments, military and security industry – much of it at taxpayer expense.
Woodward's book documents the struggle with the Obama administration over Afghan policy, especially between Pentagon generals and the White House. Former Congressman Tom Andrews, head of Win Without War, noted that while Obama was debating their Afghanistan strategy, the Pentagon waged its own media campaign to steer the decision toward a military surge. Andrews and others note that the military/corporate cabal has a long history of manipulating White House policy towards their own interests.
In some of those high military circles there is great disdain for this president – and for the U.S. Constitution – that puts civilian leadership in charge of our armed forces.
General Stanley McChrystal's contemptuous comments in the recent Rolling Stone interview are a striking example of this.
In that context recent comments by General David Petraeus, the U.S. commander in Afghanistan, that the U.S. could send troops into Pakistan, are worrisome. Such a move could draw the U.S. into an even more deadly and costly war with Pakistan.
Is the Pentagon trying to steer the scheduled December Afghan policy review toward widening the war instead of ending it?
Next steps to end it
The American public is ready to withdraw from Afghanistan. Tired of the billions spent, tired of seeing the lives lost, tired of a corrupt U.S.-installed Karzai government, tired of the growth of terror networks.
If the Republicans – who insisted that Obama should “listen to the generals” and send more troops to Afghanistan – take over Congress in November, the political momentum to draw down from Afghanistan and take a nonmilitary route will be disastrously weakened. And the pressure to commit more treasure and lives to a possibly larger war in Pakistan will become greater.
The waste, the destruction, the crimes and the “everyday squalor of war” eventually need to become history for humanity. The midterm elections and ending the war in Afghanistan are two steps along the way.

Editor's note: This service is now defunct. But check out some of the other kinds of people you can rent in Japan, such as:
A little while back someone sent me a link to an interesting website. On it, they said you could rent a gaikokujin (foreign person) who will do various things for you, depending on the person. They could speak English with you (seems like the most obvious application), be a model, DJ, write, be a bartender, hang out with you, etc., etc. As long as it is legal and the gaikokujin is willing, your imagination is the limit.
Looking at the website, it was apparent that two gaikokujin were available for rental. One Australian with dark hair and a smirky smile and one American with a beard and blue eyes.
Turns out they are the co-founders and they have had many clients between them… too many, in fact. If you're a gaikokujin in Japan get in touch with these guys. They're looking to add some folks to their roster. You can visit their website at gaikokujin-rental.jp.
Although they are in their early goings over at Gaikokujin Rental, I thought it was an interesting idea. I also had no idea what it was they were doing, so I sent them an email asking if they'd be willing to do an interview. They were very gracious and got back to my questions super quickly. What follows is said interview, and it includes stories, success stories, and information on what the heck all this gaikokujin rental stuff is all about.
1. Who started gaikokujin-rental.jp?
Two guys, one Australian and one American. Both have called Japan home for a handful of years: Six and ten respectively.
2. Why did (you) start it?
"Why has someone not?," is what we have been asking ourselves for years. Peer to peer business in Japan has always been BIG. Big for both client and contractor. Yet it seems every year the market is not adequately accessed, and unfortunately for many the public space for self-promotion is in, we feel, terminal decline.
For-hire platforms available at present are largely top-down corporate to individual, not peer to peer, and we think peer to peer is important and remarkable. We think it makes for new economy.
Also, we feel Gaikokujin Rental serves as an alternative meeting space to the usual foreigner/Japanese social venues which exist in Japan today.
Author Note: Oh, so it's like AirBnB but for people and their skills/time. Now I'm starting to get it.
3. How long have you been renting foreigners?
Gaikokujin Rental officially launched on November 29, 2013.
4. It looks like you have two people being rented out. Who are they?
They are the co-founders, Austin and Adams.
5. Are you looking to add more people to rent out?
We are actively looking to add more foreigners as well as increase Japanese readership at our site – We wish to bring as many people together and build as many success stories as possible. To this end, we have invested energy and time into the idea, sustainability and scalability of Gaikokujin Rental.
6. What kinds of things have you done? I need a bedtime story.
Austin:
I once had a woman hire me to look after their children and clean their house. I was hired by a Japanese woman to go shopping with them and pick out a birthday present for their husband because they were a foreigner. I was asked to attend a bonenkai with a group of salary men and speak only English with them. I was asked by a young Japanese couple to come to Kyoto and take pictures of the two of them.
Author Note: Now Austin tells a story:
Well, it started around 8:00 on a Friday night. I got off from work and was asked to meet my client at Nagoya (Meieki) station. We engaged in small talk for a few minutes, after which they asked me if I could do two things. The first was to check some English paper work which they had been given by their boss. I was asked to explain it and help them with some possible answers. After that, they wanted me to join them for dinner. My client enjoyed eating spicy food but none of their friends or family enjoyed spicy food. We had exchanged mail previously and found that we both had a liking for spicy food. They had already found one of the spiciest Nabe restaurants in Nagoya and made a reservation. After making our way to the restaurant we entered, took a seat and decided what we wanted to eat. I then helped my client with the paper work which had been mentioned earlier after that our meals arrived and we chatted while we ate. They asked me some questions about what it was like living abroad ( because they were thinking of doing the same one day). And also asked me questions about my country. The rental period was for 2 hours. So after the 2 hour period was up we talked about the possibility of meeting again, paid the check and went home.
Adams:
I've had clients ranging from housewives to business people to ramen chefs to entrepreneurs to bohemian outcasts – a motley cast of characters. Once I was asked to work in a Ramen shop to take orders from Russians, because apparently the Ramen shop Master "couldn't understand the Russians." I've done interpretation work between Italian business people and a Japanese apparel firm, but most of the work involved making reservations at onsens for the Italians. I've been in front of and behind the camera for modeling and photography work, behind a desk as a freelance journalist and webshop master, a private mail courier for digital products, Santa Claus… YES, Santa Claus, an English teacher, a flyer boy, a bar server, and a BIG buyer of Switzerland-made outdoor clothing for a Japanese Trading company.
7. Have you run into any problems while running this service?
Yes, but not the kind one would bemoan about. Actually at present there are simply too many orders to fill for our current line-up of two foreigners. This is the scenario we envisioned, and to ratchet up both the supply and demand we are working in earnest to promote our service via virtual channels, magazines and ultimately word-of-mouth.
8. What's the best success story of someone using gaikokujin-rental.jp?
It would be difficult to only talk about the best success story and not mention all the really good ones. On the Japanese side of it, students have increased their TOIEC scores, hobbyists have procured parts and various nick-knacks from abroad that otherwise could not have been gotten, local business people have been fed detailed information on foreign market trends, party-goers have been entertained, and the list goes on.
On the foreigner side of it, success is in the MAGIC. The magic being that once your profile goes up online at Gaikokujin Rental you can get paying customers who deal with you directly. Furthermore, your new customer is an in-road into their own network – ehem, your new network.
9. What are you hoping to achieve with gaikokujin-rental.jp?
In a word, symbiosis. We want to turn the disconnect between peer-to-peer business into uber-connection! To us growth means lots of little success stories the length of Japan, new networks forged, smiles, and satisfied customers. We plan to make this happen by staying online as a professional go-between for that all-important first connection between Japanese and foreigners.
For Japanese, we hope to attract anyone and everyone, including businesses, who seek to employ foreigners in one way or another.
For foreigners, we hope to attract everyone from young transplants to long timers to even those residing abroad who perhaps offer services via the Internet, and in general anyone here who seeks odd-jobs, freelance stuff, part-time work, one-off arrangements, and basically new money and customers. That's teachers of all sorts, musicians, caregivers, models, IT people, photographers, artisans, entertainers, self-proclaimed ambassadors and more.
So there you have it. At first I thought Gaikokujin Rental was some kind of joke. Something someone put up as a kind of commentary about how "differently" gaikokujin were viewed in Japan. Or, at the very least I thought it was a hobby that a couple of dudes set up because they thought there was an opportunity to make some extra yen.
It turns out, in my opinion, to be a pretty smart business idea. Of course, they have to find new people on both sides (Japanese and gaikokujin), and they are eventually going to have to deal with the problems that come with bad experiences, etc., but in Japan I can see this business model working. Anywhere else? Not so much. Just imagine if there was a "Rent a Norwegian" company in America, where you would get your Norway-related needs filled. There would be a small mob outside the Rent-A-Norwegian office demanding that this racism stops.
In Japan, however, I doubt this is going to be seen as racism. There's actual need for gaikokujin-related tasks in Japan, as was illustrated in the stories above. A Japanese person needed an opinion from a foreigner about a gift for their foreign husband. Some people needed someone who could speak English. Another person just wanted to eat spicy food with someone (which I can attest to, Japanese people don't know what "spicy" really means).
I hope they keep on trucking along and start to grow and do okay. Maybe we'll see if we can meet up with them and see what they're doing the next time we're filming in Japan.
National and state air regulators, in a notice mailed to Volkswagen AG on Friday, accused the company of installing software in about half a million cars designed to pass federal emissions tests but release higher-than-acceptable levels in everyday driving situations.
In the violation notice, issued to the car company and subsidiaries Audi AG and Volkswagen Group of America Inc., U.S. EPA said the company built and installed these computer algorithms in approximately 482,000 diesel cars sold since 2008.
The software allowed VW cars to activate emission controls during emission tests but during normal use to release up to 40 times the permitted amount of nitrogen oxides, or NOx -- which help generate low-hanging ozone that blankets cities -- and minute particulate matter, which causes breathing issues and is linked to millions of early deaths (ClimateWire, Sept. 17).
"While individual vehicles don't create a health threat, collectively they do harm public health," said Janet McCabe, acting assistant administrator for EPA's Office of Air and Radiation. Both particulate matter and NOx have climate change impacts. NOx dissipates faster than carbon dioxide but helps create tropospheric ozone, a more potent greenhouse gas.
EPA named five types of four-cylinder diesels -- the Audi A3, Beetle, Golf, Jetta and Passat, all of which have the same engine -- in its notice.
EPA did not issue a recall and said the cars remain safe and legal to drive and also legal to sell. Fixing the cars' emission systems will be incumbent upon Volkswagen, the agency said.
Volkswagen violated the Clean Air Act, officials said, under which the penalty could reach $37,500 per car, or slightly more than $18 billion, a figure a U.S. EPA official said is accurate.
The German automaker, the largest worldwide by sales, concealed vital information from the U.S. federal government, the public and the California Air Resources Board (ARB), said Cynthia Giles, assistant administrator for U.S. EPA's Office of Enforcement and Compliance Assurance. Investigations by EPA and ARB are underway.
"These violations are very serious. We expected better from VW," Giles said.
"Our goal now is to ensure that the affected cars are brought into compliance, to dig more deeply into the extent and implications of Volkswagen's efforts to cheat on clean air rules," said Richard Corey, executive officer of ARB, in a statement.

Earlier, VW admitted its vehicles contained software being questioned
Volkswagen admitted earlier this month that the vehicles contained defeat devices.
Volkswagen "manufactured and installed" sophisticated software, known under federal law as "defeat devices," which can be programmed to detect when vehicles are being tested to meet emission requirements, officials said.
"[The device] senses whether the vehicle is being tested or not based on various inputs including the position of the steering wheel, vehicle speed, the duration of the engine's operation and barometric pressure," the violation notice reads. "These inputs precisely track the parameters of the federal test procedure" used for EPA certification, it reads.
Two years ago, met with puzzling results from on-road and in-the-lab vehicle tests, examiners did the research and asked questions that would ultimately trigger Friday's announcement.
The International Council on Clean Transportation, a nonprofit research group, had commissioned West Virginia University researchers to test three European diesels -- a Jetta, a Passat and a BMW X5 -- and study NOx emissions and other pollutants under real-world scenarios.
Tested on a dynamometer -- a large treadmill-type platform for cars, sometimes called a "rolling road," that measures for torque, power and other vehicle metrics -- the VWs passed. Yet under real-world conditions, testers drove the cars equipped with emissions-tracking sensors between Southern California and Seattle, and the VWs spewed far more from their tailpipes than legally allowed.
The Jetta's emissions were 15 to 35 times higher than acceptable. For the Passat, they were five to 20 times higher, while the BMW averaged levels either at or below the legal threshold.
"This inconsistency was a major factor in ICCT's decision to contact CARB and EPA about our test results," ICCT said Friday.
Trail of evidence started in Europe
"Ironically, the reason we tested these vehicles is that we were finding high vehicle emissions from light-duty cars in Europe," said Drew Kodjak, ICCT's executive director, in an interview.
The team's hypothesis was that the European emissions tests were flimsier than U.S. tests, they said.
"The vehicle was programmed to 'switch,' as the EPA says, from low emissions to high efficiency," Kodjak said. Asked what automakers have to gain from installing so-called defeat devices, experts said they can save the company money on warranty claims, make the vehicle more fun to drive and, likely ironic to some, improve fuel economy.
"It's a performance boost. It's fuel savings," Kodjak said, explaining that as cars have gotten more advanced, the industry has increasingly relied on software patches and digital code to update its models.
Daniel Carder, now the interim director of the Center for Alternative Fuels, Engines and Emissions at West Virginia University, worked on the WVU report, which the team published in May of 2014.
If automakers have software algorithms or updates that don't meet federal code, they can negotiate with EPA, Carder said in an interview. And both parties hash out approval of "auxiliary emission control devices," like the ones VW used, they said.
"That's all confidential information," Carder said.
Petrolheads worldwide purchase and then erase or modify computer chips in their vehicles' computers, called electronic control units, or ECUs, to get better performance, efficiency and fuel savings. Online, these chips are available for a few hundred dollars.
"It's like a tremendous number of people that do this," said John Storey, an automotive and emissions expert at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, putting the figure of "chipped" models between 40 and 60 percent of all diesel pickup trucks in the United States. One byproduct of all this tampering: higher emissions of gases like NOx. "These are completely illegal, but no one ever gets caught," they said.
Congressman wants EPA to consider 'severe action'
"If Volkswagen willfully sought to evade the Clean Air Act and fraudulently sold cars to millions of consumers with this technology, EPA should pursue the most severe action possible to deter others from doing the same," Rep. Frank Pallone (D-N.J.), ranking member of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, said in a statement.
"Such deceitful actions violated the law and misled consumers, while other law abiding companies were disadvantaged and the public health was put at risk," they said. "We must ensure that this does not happen again and that consumers can trust the products that they buy."
Yet similar violations have happened before.
The Justice Department and EPA settled with seven heavy-duty diesel engine companies in 1998 for more than a billion dollars over remarkably similar charges: The manufacturers had installed defeat devices in software packages, which let the trucks pass federal tests but led to up to three times the legal limit of NOx gases when driven on the highway.
Dynamometer tests are flawed in part because the conditions they put a car under can be easy to predict and, in turn, beat.
"Well, we hope they're not common," said Kodjak of the ICCT, referring to defeat devices. "You run a risk of getting caught, and the penalties are severe," they said, noting the heavy-duty truck settlement in 1998. "But it is true that unless there is random testing of vehicles, you know, you might, you might not get caught," they said.
Don Anair, research and deputy director of the Clean Vehicles Program at the Union of Concerned Scientists, said holding car companies to the same standard is vital.
"It appears they did this with the intent of clearly making the emissions performance different on the test cycle, which I think is the most surprising," Anair said in an interview. "Testing in real-world situations is critical," they said, to confirm that car companies are operating on a "level playing field."
The diesel share of the U.S. auto market is slightly less than 1 percent of all car sales in 2014. But a large portion of the diesels are VW-made, which means diesel vehicles could be responsible for between 10 and 25 percent of all NOx emissions from light-duty cars last year, according to Dave Cooke, a vehicle analyst at UCS.
CEO of VW orders external investigation
Martin Winterkorn, CEO of Volkswagen, said the company takes seriously this allegation of "manipulations that violate American environmental standards." The company ordered an external investigation into the matter and will cooperate fully to "openly and completely establish all of the facts of this case," they said.
"I personally am deeply sorry that we have broken the trust of our customers and the public," Winterkorn said in a statement. "The trust of our customers and the public is and continues to be our most important asset. We at Volkswagen will do everything that must be done in order to re-establish the trust that so many people have placed in us, and we will do everything necessary in order to reverse the damage this has caused."
In an email, Luke Tonachel, director of the Natural Resources Defense Council's clean vehicles and fuels project, said cars emit up to 30 percent of the NOx and volatile organic compounds in areas that fail ambient air quality standards, releasing smog and soot skyward. "It's very disturbing to learn that VW is flouting those standards," they said.
"Why would they think they'd get away with it?" asked Storey, the Oak Ridge scientist, noting the use of the defeat devices went on for six model years. "It's ludicrous."
Wondering how to make a Moscow Mule or a Margarita? Google this morning is rolling out a new search feature that will tell you how to make any cocktail, offering step-by-step instructions, a list of ingredients, and even serving suggestions like type of garnish or drinkware. The addition is one of many ways that Google is trying to turn its search service into more of a virtual assistant for its users – and especially its mobile users – by offering the answers to common questions ahead of its actual search results.
In the past, Google has added other useful information to its “Knowledge Graph,” as this semantic-search base is called, which is used to supplement the organic search results with summarized information drawn from the web. Initially, the focus was on answering queries about persons, places or things – factual information – but, over time, it's been able to respond to even more complex queries. For example, last month, it introduced relevant medical facts in response to users' queries about common health conditions.
The cocktail query, while maybe not as important in the grand scheme of things, is notable because there's not necessarily only one way to make a drink. Instead, Google is actually figuring out which is the most preferred and popular cocktail recipe, based on search data. The company explains that the information on the cocktails come from a variety of sources, including both content sites and resources like Wikipedia, and the information is cross-checked in order to find the most consistent recipes and instructions. When one particular site is used for the recipe, that's linked in the results.
In addition, the search feature is updated constantly in order to keep the recipes “fresh” based on its data sources and what people are searching for.
Because the feature is powered by Google's Knowledge Graph, it will work on both the desktop and the web. But Google thinks the mobile use case is more compelling – that is, it makes more sense that users may pull out their phone while at a bar, when trying to decide what to order. Or they may just be trying to make their own cocktails at home, like while hosting a party, for example.
To use the feature in Google's mobile app on iOS or Android, you just press the mic button and ask, “OK Google, how do I make a….?”
Google says that people today search for a broad range of topics on its site – 15% of searches it gets every day are new – and it wants to help answer those questions, no matter how specific. The feature arriving today is only for drinks, not food recipes, but Google already has implemented search tools that aid with those searches. While not a part of the Knowledge Graph, Google already lets you narrow down recipe choices by ingredients, cooking time, calories, and more, and for some foods, instructions are also provided.

Billionaires Are Quietly Buying These 5 Stocks
A second Russia Today correspondent has quit their job, saying the Kremlin-funded station's anchors "do work for" Russian President Vladimir Putin and lied on-air to the public.London reporter Sara Firth announced their resignation nearly two hours after taking to Twitter in a conversation with Russia Today's London correspondent Polly Boiko, The Huffington Post reported Firth said the network asks its anchors to "obscure the truth," and that she'd had enough.The conversation popped up after another Twitter user complained to Boiko about the network's coverage of after a suspected surface-to-air missile brought down Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 as it flew from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur:When Boiko asked Tanos what they are spreading, Firth popped in with a tweet accusing the London anchor — and themselves — of lying on a daily basis, saying:She told The Press Gazette in London that they made their decision to quit Thursday afterher newsroom's response to the reports about the deadly plane crash."Yesterday when the story broke you get the kick in your stomach when you're going to get the facts and it's this huge story," they said. "And I walked into the newsroom and they were running an eyewitness account of God-knows who the person was blaming the Ukrainian government, and it is such a volatile situation."Firth, who has been with Russia Today since 2009, told BuzzFeed Friday that the organization's coverage of the crash was "the total disregard to the facts. We threw up eyewitness accounts from someone on the ground openly accusing the Ukrainian government [of involvement in the disaster], and a correspondent in the studio pulled up a plane crash before that the Ukrainian government had been involved in and said it was 'worth mentioning.' "But the prior plane crash wasn't "worth mentioning," Firth said.“I couldn't do it any more," Firth said. "Every single day we're lying and finding sexier ways to do it.”Earlier this year, former Russia Today correspondent Liz Wahl quit while they were on the air, saying they couldn't support a network that "whitewashes the actions of Putin" while asking them to "promote Russian foreign policy."
P-61: The American “Flying Tank”
Created as a night fighter, the American P-61 Black Widow found itself adopting many professions in the war – and it was always good at them. One of the most interesting American aircraft of the Second World War has arrived in War Thunder with Update 1.57!
When it became clear that the US Army Air Force was lacking a night fighter, American engineers undertook to solve the problem with characteristic American enthusiasm. And so, the P-61 Black Widow night fighter was born – an incredibly advanced aircraft for its time, large, powerful, armed to the teeth and very expensive.
As it turned out, by the time the P-61 became available to the army, a night fighter was no longer required in the Pacific theater – the Americans had full control of the air, and the Japanese feared to fly by night. Here, the Black Widow proved to be an excellent support aircraft for ground troops and a good assault aircraft thanks to its incredible firepower and its ability to even carry bombs, rockets and barrels of napalm. In Europe, the US's new night fighter proved its excellence in its intended role and also as an interceptor (even the German V-1 flying bomb had met its match with it), and of course, again as an assault aircraft.
In War Thunder, the American “flying tank” is a rank III aircraft with powerful frontal weaponry (four 20mm cannons and four 12.7 mm machine guns), a solid frame, protected fuel tanks, the ability to carry up to four 1,000 lb bombs, and a highly curious turret with four Browning 12.7 mm machine guns, capable of attacking targets all across its upper surfaces. Incidentally, this turret could also be locked to shoot forwards, so the pilot could control it as a frontal weapon. In War Thunder, we plan to introduce this function a little later in the form of a researched modification.
In War Thunder Update 1.57, the aircraft will be presented in two versions:
P-61A-1 – the early model of the aircraft in army livery.
P-61C-1 – a night bomber with improved flight characteristics and black camouflage (the black paint scheme is what gave this aircraft its name, Black Widow). An air brake is installed in this model.
The P-61's appearance is highly unusual. Its stepped cabin is somehow reminiscent of the cabin on modern attack helicopters. Note that the Black Widow model correctly duplicates the canopy framing of the cabin and the hatch through which the pilot and radar operator entered the vehicle. The gunner, who was seated in the rear of the fuselage, had an excellent panoramic view to the rear – our artists carefully recreated their cabin also in the in-game model.
One of the unique characteristics of the P-61 is its spoilers, which move out from the wings upwards and, in practice, fulfilled the role of ailerons. The spoilers themselves and their animation were recreated in our in-game model. They are also fully functional in the aircraft's flight model.
In short, the Black Widow is certainly an interesting aircraft, equally useful both in an air combat role and in mixed battles of War Thunder. Try out this American technological marvel of its time in War Thunder Update 1.57.

Wal-Mart has a new idea to help their most needy employees: more incestuous charity from their workforce.
0 SHARES Share Tweet
News this week of Wal-Mart's attempts to help out its employees by way of canned food donated by other Wal-Mart employees was met with sharp criticism. Instead of paying their employees a wage that wouldn't require the assistance of their other underpaid staff, Wal-Mart decided to guilt-trip — er appeal to the kindness of — the employees who by some obvious oversight have been allowed to see their wages increase to the level where they can afford to chip in a can of tomato soup or tuna to their fellow “associates.” However, what they didn't realize is that in doing so, they were putting those employees who donated food in a predicament of their own, since after all they are Wal-Mart employees as well and their wages are scientifically calculated by Wal-Mart's patented Avarice 5000 Wage Computation computer system, developed to keep each employee's wage at the perfect level to ensure maximum profit, regardless of any other factors.
When those Wal-Mart associates who donated food came to their bosses asking for more hours to make up for the food costs they took on in donating to their less fortunate co-workers, the executives knew exactly what to do. Speaking at a press conference at their Ft. Willow Branch, OH location, Wal-Mart spokesperson Robert Gluttin announced the creation of a new charity that would be aimed at helping the less fortunate Wal-Mart employees who helped the somehow even less fortunate Wal-Mart employees. “Wal-Mart is all about doing whatever it takes to make sure our labor automatons are treated just well enough to keep laboring, and not form a revolt against their corporate overlords. We sell guns, for Christ's sake. Therefore, it is with great pride that we announce the creation of the ‘Help Those Who Helped Others Even Though They Really Couldn't Afford It But They Clearly Have Bigger and More Compassionate Hearts Than Any Executive This Corporate Juggernaut Has' charity drive,” said Gluttin.
Starting next week, Wal-Mart employees will have the option of donating any percentage of their paycheck they desire and take the balance on Wal-Mart gift cards, provided the sum left over is enough to cover the cost of the plastic on the card. In the event it isn't, charitable Wal-Mart donors can take the balance in non-legal tender Wal-Bucks that can be used to purchase anything in the store other than food, toiletries, clothing, books, electronics, or non-firearm related sporting goods. “Wal-Mart is dedicated to helping our employees get the food they need, just as long as it doesn't take a dime out of our executives pockets. This new charity for those who gave to our last charity shows that commitment is real and true.”
UPDATE: After being reminded by Terry Walmart, the current Assistant to the Chief Financial Officer of Wal-Mart, that there was already a system in place to help the truly needy among the Wal-Mart work force, the Help Those Who Helped Others Even Though They Really Couldn't Afford It But They Clearly Have Bigger and More Compassionate Hearts Than Any Executive This Corporate Juggernaut Has charity program was shut down in favor of the already existing system: Food stamps and other social welfare programs paid for by the taxpayers, which includes Wal-Mart employees.

Can Celebrity Scientists Change The Way People Think About Science And Religion?
Stephen Jay Gould famously described the relationship between science and religion as one of "non-overlapping magisteria," with science restricted to facts and theories about the empirical universe, and religion to questions of moral meaning and value.
This is one way to understand the relationship between science and religion: two compartments with a solid wall between them, fixed and non-porous.
But it's by no means the only, or even the most popular, approach.
A common alternative is to regard science and religion as partners in a shared enterprise — collaborative and ultimately compatible. Francis Collins, the director of the National Human Genome Research Institute and a devout Christian, is a well-known proponent of a view along these lines. In a 2006 debate arranged by TIME, they argued that "Gould sets up an artificial wall between the two worldviews." Collins went on to explain that because they believe that God created everything in the first place, "studying the natural world is an opportunity to observe the majesty, the elegance, the intricacy of God's creation."
Yet another perspective is that the relationship between science and religion is one of conflict, with the two regarded as fundamentally incompatible. In light of this incompatibility, only one approach can win: either science or religion. Richard Dawkins, the well-known evolutionary biologist and science popularizer, is a forceful advocate for this approach, arguing that the victor is — and should be — science.
In the same 2006 debate with Collins, Dawkins speculated that "Gould's separate compartments was a purely political ploy to win middle-of-the-road religious people to the science camp." Instead, Dawkins argued, religion regularly encroaches on the territory of science, and it's science that succeeds in answering the questions traditionally posed by religion. "The question of whether there exists a supernatural creator, a God," they urged, "is one of the most important that we have to answer." But they went on to claim that it is "a scientific question," and that their answer is "no."
These perspectives on the relationship between science and religion — independence, compatibility, or conflict — have dominated popular debate. But it's natural to wonder whether these views are actually representative of most people's beliefs, and whether the views of scientists and science popularizers, such as Collins and Dawkins, have any real impact on public opinion.
Does learning about Dawkins, for example, effectively change some people's minds, leading them to regard science and religion as conflicting approaches where the former invalidates the latter? Or might their perspective sometimes backfire, leading those with strong religious commitments to concede that there's a conflict, but to opt to resolve it in favor of religion?
In a 2017 paper published in the journal Public Understanding of Science, sociologists Christopher Scheitle and Elaine Ecklund decided to find out. They conducted a nationally representative survey of 10,241 adults living within the United States, where respondents were asked to indicate which narrative about the relationship between science and religion best described their view: one of independence, collaboration, or conflict. Those who chose conflict additionally specified whether they were on the side of science or religion.
The critical experimental manipulation embedded within the survey was a summary of Collins's perspective or a summary of Dawkins's perspective. Specifically, some participants received one of the following two brief descriptions before they reported their own beliefs about the relationship between science and religion:
"Dr. Francis Collins is a geneticist who has directed the Human Genome Project and the National Institutes of Health. Dr. Collins is also an outspoken Christian who has said that God is capable of performing miracles and that religion and science are 'entirely compatible.'"
"Dr. Richard Dawkins is an evolutionary biologist and emeritus fellow at Oxford University. Dr. Dawkins is also an outspoken atheist who has said that the existence of God and miracles is 'very improbable' and that religion and science are in conflict with each other."
Other participants didn't receive either description, but still indicated which of the four views about science and religion came closest to their own, providing a basis for comparison. The researchers could thereby evaluate whether exposure to the perspectives of Collins or Dawkins had any impact on respondents' own views.
Regardless of which description respondents were given, the most popular position was that science and religion can co-exist in some form of collaboration. Almost as popular was the view that science and religion are independent. Conflict came in third, with religion favored slightly more often than science. So overall, Collins's perspective was the favorite, Gould's was a close second, and Dawkins's was a fairly distant fourth.
But for many people, these perspectives weren't deeply entrenched. We know this because learning about Collins's perspective was enough to change some people's minds.
For those participants who were not already familiar with Collins, learning about them for the first time had a significant effect, leading more of them to endorse a collaborative view. Those who did not receive the description about them endorsed a collaborative perspective 35.3 percent of the time, whereas those who did receive the description endorsed collaboration 49.8 percent of the time. Correspondingly, fewer participants who learned about Collins endorsed independence or the view that there's a conflict that should be resolved in favor of religion.
For those participants who were not already familiar with Dawkins, by contrast, learning about them for the first time had no reliable effect. Of those from this sample who didn't learn about Dawkins, 10.7 percent endorsed their conflict view in favor of science; among those who did learn about Dawkins, 12.4 percent endorsed this view. This difference was not statistically significant, nor were there significant differences in the endorsement of any other view.
These findings suggest that celebrity scientist opinions can have an influence on how people think about the relationship between science and religion. But the findings also suggest that such effects may be modest and variable. While Collins had a persuasive effect, learning about Dawkins was neither persuasive nor off-putting.
As always with individual scientific studies, many questions remain open. For example, it's unclear whether learning about Collins had more than a transient effect. Would those participants who learned about them in the survey be any more inclined to endorse collaboration weeks or years later? It's also unclear whether learning about Collins shifted perspectives because they explicitly endorsed collaboration, or because their identity as a scientist and a Christian was itself a challenge to some forms of conflict. Similarly, it could be that Dawkins was unpersuasive not because their perspective was itself unconvincing, but because respondents found them less credible or trustworthy: Research has consistently found that, on average, Americans distrust atheists far more than they distrust religious believers.
In my view, one of the most interesting results was that Dawkins's position didn't backfire by prompting those with religious inclinations to acknowledge a conflict between science and religion, but to choose to resolve it in favor of religion. This could be because the description of their view was — for Dawkins — fairly tame. Elsewhere, he's written that "faith is the great cop-out"; that "there is something infantile in the presumption that somebody else has a responsibility to give your life meaning." This kind of rhetoric might encourage some people to turn to religion in defense, or to distance themselves from what they perceive to be an insensitive perspective, even if they partially agree.
The study by Scheitle and Ecklund is among the first to explore how individuals and the media can influence people's views about the relationship between science and religion, so the conclusions that we can draw are correspondingly modest. We need many studies exploring many factors across many populations before a more complete picture can emerge. Given how powerfully narratives about science and religion seem to be shaping American policy and politics — this is a picture we might want to develop.

All-terrain vehicles (ATVs) are a fun way for families to savor the outdoors. Indeed, ATVs can be enjoyed by people of all ages, and young children may safely drive them. However, choosing the right size ATV for your children is very important. It's essential that you restrict access to the vehicle until your kids understand how to operate the controls.
ATV Basics
ATVs are off-road vehicles outfitted with small but powerful engines, designed to navigate a variety of terrain types. These vehicles enable users to cover hundreds of miles of rough surface within days, often at speeds up to 70 mph. They come in different sizes with a range of motors that vary in power capability. According to the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC), children under 16 deemed capable of driving an ATV should be provided with a smaller model, with speeds limited accordingly.
Child Assessment
Parents are the best at determining their children's abilities. Physical and emotional development are the best clues when determining whether or not your child should operate an ATV.
When choosing the right size ATV for your children, experts recommend a few considerations. First, kids should be matched with a machine that offers no fewer than three inches of clearance between their pants' seat and the ATV's seat when standing. Further, the child must be able to grip the handlebars and move them all the way to the left and right, in addition to operating the throttle and brake lever with one hand. Finally, if the child can control a bike without any problems, then it may be a good time to try an ATV.
Another matter to keep in mind is emotional development. A child should be able to grasp the consequences of their actions and demonstrate self control before riding an ATV. There are rules for operating these vehicles, especially on various terrain types, so a young operator should learn the importance these requirements through a safety course. Notably, some 25 percent of all ATV injuries involve children who are under age 16.
ATV Type
There are two types of ATVs available: three- and four-wheel models. By far, four-wheel ATVs are the safest because they provide more balance and stability. In some places, new three-wheel ATVs have been banned because they are much more dangerous.
Additionally, the CSPC has issued guidelines to help parents choose an ATV for their children based on age and engine size. Children aged six to 11 should use an ATV with an engine under 70 cc. Children 12 to 15 can operate an ATV with a 70–90 cc engine. Only teens 16 and above should operate an adult ATV with an engine up to 700 cc.
Child Safety
If you believe that your child can safely operate an ATV, there are a number of ways you can make their experience safer. First, outfit the ATV with lights and reflectors to increase visibility. Second, insist that your child operate the ATV responsibly and only in the presence of an adult. Third, stay off of public roads; they are not designed for ATVs. Finally, only one person should ride on an ATV that is designed for one individual. There are two-person models available, but these usually should be restricted to adult riders only. Also, before you head out, ensure that the ATV is in top working order. Lubricate the chassis and make sure a fresh belt is installed (if equipped).

President Jerry Falwell Jr. urged students to get their permits to carry concealed weapons during the school's convocation. Falwell discussed the San Bernardino shooting and said, "If more good people had concealed carry permits, then we could end those Muslims before they walked in." (Liberty University)
The president of Liberty University, a popular pilgrimage site for presidential candidates, urged students during the school's convocation Friday to get their permits to carry concealed weapons.
In their remarks, President Jerry Falwell Jr., son of the late religious right leader Jerry Falwell Sr., pressed students at the Christian school in Lynchburg, Va., to carry weapons on campus following Wednesday's mass shooting in San Bernardino, Calif.
“It just blows my mind that the president of the United States [says] that the answer to circumstances like that is more gun control,” they said to applause.
“If some of those people in that community center had what I have in my back pocket right now …,” they said while being interrupted by louder cheers and clapping. “Is it illegal to pull it out? I don't know,” they said, chuckling.
“I've always thought that if more good people had concealed-carry permits, then we could end those Muslims before they walked in,” they say, the rest of their sentence drowned out by loud applause while they said, “and killed them.”
“I just wanted to take this opportunity to encourage all of you to get your permit. We offer a free course,” they said. “Let's teach them a lesson if they ever show up here.”
[Obama on ISIS: ‘They are thugs and killers,']
Falwell told The Washington Post on Saturday that they have had a concealed-carry permit for about a year, but decided for the first time Friday to carry a .25 pistol because of the attacks in San Bernardino on Wednesday. Falwell said they have had several shotguns, rifles and pistols on their farm for several years but is new to carrying a concealed weapon and needs to find a holster for their pistol.
Falwell said that when they referred to “those Muslims,” they were referring to Islamic terrorists, specifically those behind the attacks in Paris and in San Bernardino. “That's the only thing I would clarify,” Falwell said. “If I had to say what I said again, I'd say exactly the same thing.”
On the Sunday after 14 people were shot to death in San Bernardino, Calif., presidential hopefuls weigh in on proposals for dealing with gun restrictions, including an amendment - rejected by the Senate - that would ban individuals on the terror watch list from buying guns.

A spokesperson for Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe (D) sent the following statement on Saturday:
“My administration is committed to making Virginia an open and welcoming Commonwealth, while also ensuring the safety of all of our citizens. Mr. Falwell's rash and repugnant comments detract from both of those crucial goals,” McAuliffe said. “Those of us in leadership positions, whether in government or education, must take care to remember the tremendous harm that can result from reckless words.”
Liberty University's convocation service, held three times a week in a 12,000-seat sports arena, is mandatory for the schools' students who live on campus and is also watched by thousands of its 95,000 online students.
Falwell said their comments have generated the most positive comments they have ever received for remarks made during convocation. “The support here on campus is almost universal,” they said. Students of all faiths can attend Liberty, and Falwell estimated that about 15 to 20 students on campus are Muslim.
Some theologians believe that Jesus would call on Christians to put down their weapons in the face of violence. In response, Falwell referenced the story from the gospels of Jesus chasing money changers out of the temple with a whip.
“Jesus said ‘Render unto Caesar that which is Caesar's,' and part of that was to go to war, protecting whatever nation was under control of the king,” Falwell said. “I wouldn't agree with any interpretation of Scripture that was used to say that a man or a woman shouldn't protect their families.”
Virginia residents who are at least 21 years old may apply for a concealed weapon permit once they have completed training that satisfies state requirements. Residents must be at least 18 to purchase a shotgun or rifle and 21 to purchase a handgun.
[In 30 states, a child can still legally own a rifle or shotgun]
Falwell noted the 2007 shootings at Virginia Tech, the deadliest mass shooting by a single gunman in U.S. history.
“I always wonder, what if one of those professors and students had a concealed weapon and could've ended what happened and saved countless lives?” Falwell said. “I don't understand why it's controversial for law-abiding citizens protecting themselves under the Second Amendment.”
Falwell said the overwhelming support they have received from students comes from the frustration that they don't feel represented in the national conversation about gun violence.
“I think they're so tired of being told they're the problem because they have guns and because America is a country that has gun ownership,” they said. “They don't hear anybody saying what they believe so when someone finally says something like I did yesterday, they were just hungry to hear it.”
Falwell retweeted several tweets praising their remarks, including one that said “SUCK IT, Muslim extremists,” with a link to the weapons course Liberty offers.
[Here's why Liberty University has become a pilgrimage site for GOP candidates]
In April 2013, Liberty's board of trustees approved a policy allowing students and faculty members with permits to carry concealed weapons on campus, except in residence halls. In November 2013, a 19-year-old Liberty student was shot and killed at an off-campus women's dormitory when the student attacked a campus police officer with a hammer.
Falwell's remarks to the students on Friday took place after former Republican Sen. Jim DeMint (S.C.), president of the Heritage Foundation, spoke.

Liberty prides itself on being the largest private, nonprofit university in the country, the largest university in Virginia and the largest Christian university in the world. The school has become a pilgrimage destination for Republican candidates (and Democratic candidate Bernie Sanders) seeking to build bridges to conservative Christian voters.
Most of the university's dramatic growth has come through distance education and also from an expansion in federal aid. Two decades ago, Liberty students received less than $20 million in federal aid, but its students now receive more than $800 million a year in such aid.
[Liberty University, a hub of conservative politics, owes rapid growth to federal student loans]
Most major religious groups favor stricter gun-control laws, including black Protestants (76 percent), Catholics (67 percent) and white mainline Protestants (57 percent), according to a 2013 Public Religion Research Institute survey. But white evangelicals are the religious group least likely to support stricter laws (38 percent favor them while 59 percent oppose them).

BERKELEY — Two male victims were treated at an area hospital after a weekend assault and robbery at the city's People's Park, UC Berkeley police said Monday.
At 11:06 a.m. Sunday, one victim was sitting in the park when a suspect hit them in the back of their head with a piece of wood. After the victim fell to the ground, the suspect took the victim's backpack, police said.
A male passenger in a nearby car saw what happened, got out and tried to help, but a second suspect threatened the passenger. Someone else then hit the passenger in the back of their head, sending them to the ground.
A search of the area did not turn up the suspects, described as black men in their 30s around 6 feet tall and 280 pounds with heavy builds. The first suspect had a dark complexion and wore a black-and-red jacket, while the second had a medium complexion and wore a blue jacket.
Anyone with information should call UC Berkeley police at 510-642-0472 from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. and 510-642-6760 at other times.

President Donald Trump signed an executive order on Thursday—the National Day of Prayer—that makes it easier for religious organizations to support political campaigns and could allow certain religious-affiliated employers to withhold contraception from their employees, the BBC reports.
The order instructs the IRS to "exercise maximum enforcement discretion"—which basically means to not investigate—religious groups if they openly back a political candidate. The practice is outlined in a provision in the tax code called the Johnson Amendment, which says religious organizations could lose their tax-exempt status if they publicly support a politician, the Washington Post reports. Because Trump can't repeal the law without congressional approval, he's leaning on the IRS to turn a blind eye to organizations that violate it.
The order—called the "Executive Order on Promoting Free Speech and Religious Liberty"—also asks federal agencies to allow some religious groups to refuse to give their employees birth control, as they're required to do under Obamacare.
"We will not allow people of faith to be targeted, bullied or silenced ever again," Trump told reporters at a ceremony at the Rose Garden.
The Trump administration has significantly watered down the order, cutting a number of provisions that appeared in an original draft obtained by the Nation in February. Essentially, the draft exempted a wide range of organizations from federal laws that prohibit discrimination based on someone's sexuality, stance on gay marriage, or views on abortion. After facing backlash from civil liberties and LGBTQ groups, the administration apparently dialed the order back a bit.
Still, the ACLU has condemned Thursday's order and vowed to challenge its legality.
"The actions taken today are a broadside to our country's long-standing commitment to the separation of church and state," the organization wrote on Twitter. "It's a dual dose of pandering to a base and denying reproductive care. We will see Trump in court, again."

A meteorologist at the National Weather Service, now long retired, used to say that the rainy season starts with the World Series and ends with spring training.
Well, the season's first significant storm, which started with a downpour during the San Francisco Giants' World Series championship parade on Friday, gave a little bit more on Saturday. The storm left between a quarter- and a half-inch of rain around the Bay Area.
It might not be saying much, but that means the rainfall total so far this season, at least for the South Bay, is — dare we say it — “normal.”
And in the midst of a historic three-year drought, normal — if only fleeting — is a good thing.
“I'd hate to say I'm basing an entire season on one system,” said Diana Henderson, of the National Weather Service in Monterey. “But it's definitely a better start than in some years we've had. Hopefully it will stay this way.”
Other cities around the bay, including Oakland and San Francisco, weren't so lucky. They're now at 79 percent and 69 percent of normal, respectively, Henderson said. And, alas, the rest of the week calls for sunny skies and mild temperatures.
Still, Lake Tahoe resorts were thrilled to get a dusting Friday and Saturday, accompanied by cool temperatures.
Three inches fell on the top of Heavenly, 2 inches at North Star and 10 inches at Kirkwood, known for its big snow.
“It's always hard to know what the weather's going to do, but every new season we enter it with a lot of hope and anticipation,” said Sally Gunter, of Heavenly Mountain Resorts. “And we're very thankful for the snowmaking equipment we have to supplement whatever Mother Nature decides to do.”
The two-day storm system dropped more rain the farther south it went. San Francisco received just under a quarter-inch, while downtown Oakland and Concord received nearly a third of an inch. A half-inch of rain fell on San Jose, while a full inch fell in Santa Cruz. Monterey got 2 inches.

Eric Gein runs a controversial website known for selling items crafted by serial predators and some of the nation's most notorious murderers. Serial Killers Ink is much more than a dark market targeting fans of the macabre, however. It's the premier source for "true crime collectibles" and "murderabilia." To clarify, the items "crafted" by inmates, handwritten letters, artwork and personal trinkets are just some of the things this website offers.
That's why Gein is frequently under scrutiny by victim advocate groups and the families of these victims of horrendous, and historical, crimes. Those who oppose this man's particular business feel that they are cashing-in on the pain and heartbreak of victims and their families. Unfortunately, these same types tend to smear their name and falsely accuse them of activities that they don't even do. Most recently, the mother of a girl slain by Christa Pike in 1995 has spread through the media that the notorious death row inmate is somehow profiting off of their deeds.
This simply isn't true. Eric Gein stated in an email that they have never given their profits to inmates who send them items. That means, for one thing, that Christa Pike hasn't "won" anything. Furthermore, Gein asserts that their website isn't the lucrative business that it's being made to be. It's a business and it certainly has its customer base, but it isn't like this man is "laughing all the way to the bank" off of the misfortune of others.
Here's the thing: What Eric Gein does is not only their legal right, but it's useful. While it's easy to understand the pain and suffering that victims' families go through, there is a level of irrationality behind those who rally against Serial Killers Ink.
"These Items are in fact world history,"said Eric Gein in an email before adding, "I have a few criminal law professors that use the letters to help teach their classes. A psychologist buys from me to get a better understanding of their minds. I would like to think that these men and women are using these items in a way with hopes of one day preventing a crime such as the Pike story."
It's a valid point to be made that destroying the items belonging to inmates may destroy hopes of preventing similar crimes in the future. These items, such as handwritten letters and artwork, are useful to experts, educators and profilers for their educational values. For instance, letters written by murderess Christa Pike that are featured on the site show some of their off-the-wall desires. While it may seem like nothing more than murderotica to some, to analysts and those who study criminal behavior these letters are veritable gold mines of information.

A high-speed rail project that would connect O'Hare to downtown Chicago, Rockford, Champaign and beyond made a big step this week.
The Illinois Senate passed a resolution on Sunday urging Governor Bruce Rauner and IDOT to prepare "an investment grade ridership analysis" for such a high-speed rail project. If acted upon, the resolution could bring about a study capable of attracting federal and private investments that would help bring the Midwest's rail system into the 21st century. It also calls upon Congress to pony up $2.5 billion for the project.
The prospect of a high-speed rail coming to Illinois has long been talked about, but never executed. The Obama Administration has allocated more than $11 billion since 2009 to develop faster passenger trains nationwide, but the program has been widely considered a failure.
The Midwest High Speed Rail Association (MHSRA) has been active in trying to bring the 220 mph trains to Illinois. Here's their vision of an Illinois high-speed rail network:
The Chicago-based association played a big role in a recent $1 billion federal investment to speed up Amtrak trains in Illinois. The group is hoping to have a similar success with this high-speed rail project. If all goes swimmingly, the new project would rebuild Metra's tracks in the city in order to handle both Metra and high-speed trains. The new study proposed by the Illinois Senate resolution would determine how plausible that would be.
"What we should be doing is what a lot of countries have already done," said MHSRA executive director Richard Harnish. "We should be building a completely new track that brings high-speed trains to Illinois."
Congress returns to Washington for a busy two weeks before calling it quits again. Lawmakers must pass a bill to keep the government funded beyond Sept. 30, the end of the fiscal year. Other critical legislation, including the defense authorization act, may have to wait until after the November elections.
The House is expected to take up a continuing resolution this week, with the Senate to follow next week. Congress is likely to pass some sort of funding mechanism to keep the government operating.
“It's a kick-the-ball-down-the-road strategy,” Rep. Chris Van Hollen (D- Md.) said. “Most of the discussion has been around a continuing resolution that would last until late November or early December. Then Congress would convene after the November mid-term elections and, at that point in time, work on appropriations bills.”
Continuing resolutions largely maintain the status quo, but not all the time in every respect.

“The question is whether there are going to be riders on the continuing resolution that will weigh it down and make it harder to pass, either on the Democratic or the Republican side. That's unclear at this time,” Rep. Gerry Connolly (D-Va.) said. “The CR has to fund the government at adequate levels, and we're probably going to fight about what those adequate levels are.”
“These two weeks are going to be very challenging,” they added.
It's not clear how long the continuing resolution would last. With five Democratic senators retiring this year, Republicans have a good chance to take over the upper chamber in November. For that reason, the GOP is unlikely to support anything more than a short-term fix now.
And there's the chance that some unrelated controversy could lead conservative Republicans to call for another government shutdown. Rep. Steve King (R-Iowa) has suggested a shutdown over President Barack Obama's immigration policy, according to the Des Moines Register.
While lawmakers' attention will be focused on government funding, it's not the only issue that will bubble up.
Lingering questions
Will Congress block a pay raise for feds? While Congress was away, President Obama proposed a 1 percent pay raise for federal employees. It will take effect on Jan. 1, unless Congress moves to block it. Connolly has co-sponsored legislation to boost federal pay by 3.3 percent. “I would hope we might consider that, but I don't hold out a lot of hope because I don't think the Republicans are even necessarily receptive to the 1 percent being advocated by the President,” they said, adding that there is the possibility lawmakers may try to thwart the pay raise.
Whom will the Senate confirm? The Senate will vote on some presidential nominees this week and next. But it's not clear whether Carolyn Colvin, the acting head of the Social Security Administration, will be among them. Anne Rung, the president's pick to lead the Office of Federal Procurement Policy, also waits in the wings.
Will Congress make it easier for agencies to fire federal executives? In a sweeping law to address scandals at the Veterans Affairs Department, Congress included a measure to make it easier for Secretary Bob McDonald to fire career senior executives. The House Oversight and Government Reform Committee approved in July a bill to streamline the process for dismissing Senior Executive Service members throughout the government. The House has not voted on the measure. Should it come to the floor, Connolly says he'll oppose it. “I think that would be quite disruptive to management and our ability to recruit new talent. We are now hemorrhaging federal employees,” they said.
What will happen to the Export-Import Bank? The Ex-Im Bank would not close its doors on Oct. 1, should Congress fail to pass a bill to reauthorize the small agency. But the bank would not approve new transactions, according to bank officials. Current transactions would not be affected. House Republicans are divided on the future of the bank, which provides financial services to U.S. exporters. During congressional hearings, House Financial Services Chairman Jeb Hensarling (R-Texas) has accused the bank of “crony-based lending practices.” Other Republicans see the bank as a tool to help U.S. businesses. This is not the first time the Ex-Im Bank has been a political football. In 2012, Congress overwhelming approved reauthorization, despite a similar tussle. But in an election year, the agency's future is more cloudy.
What about all that talk about streamlining federal IT? Before the break, there was a lot of talk about FITARA, a House bill to overhaul the way the government buys and manages information technology. The House passed it. A similar measure has passed a Senate committee. Connolly, who co-sponsored the legislation, is hoping the Senate will tack a version of its bill onto defense authorization legislation, which traditionally has passed Congress. They say they are pushing for that to happen in the next two weeks, but acknowledges it may have to wait until after the November elections.

The terror organisations Hamas and Hezbollah were called to help when the Danish delegation of imams in September 2005 travelled through the Middle East to draw attention to Jyllands-Posten newspaper's printing of the Mohammed cartoons.
According to a new book written by Ahmed Akkari, one of the architects behind the Cartoon Crisis, the delegation's meetings with Hamas and Hezbollah in Lebanon were never mentioned outside the closed circle of imams who feared they would lose credibility in the media.

The delegation's travels in the Middle East ending up causing violence, fierce protests and boycotts of Danish goods.

Although the infamous white feather campaign – the vile practice of women handing out white feathers to men in civilian clothing in an effort to shame them into enlisting – is associated with the First World War, during which it was a widespread phenomenon (and encouraged by leading feminists such as Christabel Pankhurst), there is evidence that some women tried to resurrect the practice in the early years of the Second World War. The following is an editorial from the Daily Mirror dated April 30th 1940 :
The antics of the feminist White Feather campaigners became so intense and feared during the course of the First World War that the government began to issue silver badges for brave soldiers who had been honourably discharged through wounds or sickness in order for them to demonstrate that they were veterans when wearing civilian clothing and hence spare them from the possible wrath of the feminist cowards.
When the Second World War broke out, there was sufficient concern that the White Feather campaign would repeat itself again that the government deemed it necessary to revive the Silver Badge idea, under the form of ‘the King's Badge'.
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_War_Badge
The Silver War Badge was issued in the United Kingdom to service personnel who had been honourably discharged due to wounds or sickness during World War I. The badge, sometimes known as the Discharge Badge, Wound Badge or Services Rendered Badge, was first issued in September 1916, along with an official certificate of entitlement. The sterling silver lapel badge was intended to be worn in civilian clothes. It had been the practice of some women to present white feathers to apparently able-bodied young men who were not wearing the King's uniform. The badge was to be worn on the right breast while in civilian dress, it was forbidden to wear on a military uniform. The badge bears the royal cipher of GRI (for Georgius Rex Imperator; George, King and Emperor) and around the rim “For King and Empire; Services Rendered”. Each badge was uniquely numbered on the reverse. The War Office made it known that they would not replace Silver War Badges if they went missing, however if one was handed into a police station then it would be returned to the War Office. If the original recipient could be traced at their or their discharge address then the badge would be returned. A very similar award, known as the King's Badge, was issued in World War II. Although each was accompanied by a certificate, issues of this latter award were not numbered.
It was common for men who had been given the White Feather by feminists in the First World War to either kill themselves through shame, or else to immediately sign up and face proabable death, even if they were suffering from genuine disability, had already fought and been traumatised, or even if they were underage children.
A man describes their grandfather's experience of being a victim of the White Feather campaigners :
After reading, in quick succession, four books about the men who fought the war, I took out a box of flimsy, yellowing letters, and tried yet again to imagine what my grandfather went through. They had three small daughters, which saved them from conscription, and their attempt to volunteer was turned down in 1914 because they were short-sighted. But in 1916, as they walked home to south London from their office, a woman gave them a white feather (an emblem of cowardice). They enlisted the next day. By that time, they cared nothing for short sight. They just wanted a body to stop a shell, which Rifleman James Cutmore duly did in February 1918, dying of their wounds on March 28. My mother was nine, and never got over it. In their last years, in the 1980s, their once fine brain so crippled by dementia that they could not remember the names of their children, they could still remember their dreadful, useless death. They could still talk of their last leave, when they were so shellshocked they could hardly speak and my grandmother ironed their uniform every day in the vain hope of killing the lice. They treasured their letters from the front, as well as information about their brothers who also died. They blamed the politicians. They blamed the generation that sent them to war. They were with Kipling: “If any question why we died, / Tell them, because our fathers lied.” They were with Sassoon: “If I were fierce, and bald, and short of breath / I'd live with scarlet majors at the Base, / And speed glum heroes up the line to death … And when the war is done and youth stone dead / I'd toddle safely home and die – in bed.” But most of all, they blamed that unknown woman who gave them a white feather, and the thousands of brittle, self-righteous women all over the country who had done the same. And there were thousands of them, as Will Ellsworth-Jones makes clear in their fascinating account of a group of conscientious objectors, We Will Not Fight. After the war, Virginia Woolf suggested there were only 50 or 60 white feathers handed out, but this was nonsense – as Ellsworth-Jones's diligent research shows. Some of their stories still have the power to make the reader angry. A 15-year-old boy lied about their age to get into the army in 1914. They were in the retreat from Mons, the Battle of the Marne and the first Battle of Ypres, before they caught a fever and was sent home. Walking across Putney Bridge, four girls gave them white feathers. “I explained to them that I had been in the army and been discharged, and I was still only 16. Several people had collected around the girls and there was giggling, and I felt most uncomfortable and … very humiliated.” They walked straight into the nearest recruiting office and rejoined the army.
Since I published this article in 2012, I did some further research into the White Feather campaign in World War II, using historical newspaper archives. I was surprised to find that the practice of handing out white feathers was even more widespread in the Second World War than previously assumed, and tragically, it did lead to suicides, including at least two teenage boys :
White Feathers During World War II Caused the Suicides of Two Teenage Boys
The Genesis Group is an auxiliary organization of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS church) for African-American members and their families. It was first organized in Salt Lake City, Utah, in 1971 to provide members an organization where they could affiliate with fellow African-American members.
The Genesis group provided meetings for black members of the LDS church (Mormons); specifically, Relief Society, Primary, Young Men, Young Women and testimony meetings. Members of Genesis were still expected to attend Sunday meetings in their home wards,[1] which at the time were sacrament meeting, Priesthood meetings, and Sunday School.[2] It was like a branch, a small group of members, but without priesthood authority. The group was led by Ruffin Bridgeforth from 1971 through 1978.[1] Shortly after the church's June 8, 1978, announcement of the revelation extending the priesthood to all worthy male members of the church, the group's attendance dropped, and officially discontinued in 1987. Participation decreased in part because it added additional time commitments to already demanding LDS church membership. In 1985, Marva Collins started a "Genesis II" group in Oakland, California and published a newsletter focused on news about black Mormons until 1988.[1]
The Genesis Group was reorganized in 1996, based on a perception that African Americans still had unique issues and could benefit from a chance to affiliate with one another. Leaders of the group include Darius Gray (1997–2003), Don Harwell (2003–2018), and Davis Stovall (2018-present).[3][4] Stake and High Councilmen were assigned to represent The Genesis Group in local organization, and a General authority was assigned to be a liaison to the group.[5]
Other Genesis groups have existed in Washington, D.C.[1]. In 2007, similar support groups existed in Hattiesburg, Mississippi, Cincinnati and Columbus, Ohio, Los Angeles, and Houston.[3]

Los Angeles is the eighth most expensive city in the world, a survey released Thursday found.
The latest Worldwide Cost of Living Survey, conducted by The Economist's Intelligence Unit, saw L.A. move up from number 19 on the list and place right behind place New York, the only other U.S. city in the top 10.
Los Angeles tied Copenhagen, Denmark and last year's most expensive city, Seoul, South Korea, according to the survey.
Singapore ranked the most expensive city and Lusaka, Zambia ranked the least expensive city. Four cities in India made the top 10 least expensive cities list.
Los Angeles was ranked the eighth most expensive city in the world by The Economist. The Economist
Measuring the cost of living
Now in its 30th year, the survey is conducted twice a year and compares more than 400 individual prices of 160 products and services.
These products and services include food, drink, clothing, household supplies and personal care items, home rents, transport, utility bills, private schools, domestic help and recreational costs, the report states.
The survey is designed to help human resources and finance managers calculate cost-of-living allowances and build compensation packages for expatriates and business travelers.
The latest survey found Asian cities tended to be the priciest locations for general grocery shopping, while European cities tended to be priciest for recreation and entertainment.
Explaining LA's ranking
“New York and Los Angeles move up the ranking because of currency headwinds rather than significant local price rises,” the report noted. “In fact, the opposite may be true.”
The stronger U.S. dollar and weaker euro pushed euro zone cities further down the ranking.
Meanwhile, stagnant inflation and a devaluation of the Japanese yen pushed the cities of Tokyo and Osaka further down the ranking — they're usually the top two most expensive cities — and a weakened Australian dollar pushed cities like Sydney and Melbourne (20th and 21st, respectively) out of this year's top ten, the report stated.
Notably, the cost of gasoline was more expensive in Los Angeles at 99 cents per liter than in New York at 63 cents per liter, though LA's cost of gas was less than all the other top 10 cities.

Create React App is a new officially supported way to create single-page React applications. It offers a modern build setup with no configuration.
Getting Started
Installation
First, install the global package:
npm install -g create-react-app
Node.js 4.x or higher is required.
Creating an App
Now you can use it to create a new app:
create-react-app hello-world
This will take a while as npm installs the transitive dependencies, but once it's done, you will see a list of commands you can run in the created folder:
Starting the Server
Run npm start to launch the development server. The browser will open automatically with the created app's URL.
Create React App uses both webpack and Babel under the hood. The console output is tuned to be minimal to help you focus on the problems:
ESLint is also integrated so lint warnings are displayed right in the console:
We only picked a small subset of lint rules that often lead to bugs.
Building for Production
To build an optimized bundle, run npm run build :
It is minified, correctly envified, and the assets include content hashes for caching.
One Dependency
Your package.json contains only a single build dependency and a few scripts:
{ "name" : "hello-world" , "dependencies" : { "react" : "^15.2.1" , "react-dom" : "^15.2.1" } , "devDependencies" : { "react-scripts" : "0.1.0" } , "scripts" : { "start" : "react-scripts start" , "build" : "react-scripts build" , "eject" : "react-scripts eject" } }
We take care of updating Babel, ESLint, and webpack to stable compatible versions so you can update a single dependency to get them all.
Zero Configuration
It is worth repeating: there are no configuration files or complicated folder structures. The tool only generates the files you need to build your app.
hello-world/ README.md index.html favicon.ico node_modules/ package.json src/ App.css App.js index.css index.js logo.svg
All the build settings are preconfigured and can't be changed. Some features, such as testing, are currently missing. This is an intentional limitation, and we recognize it might not work for everybody. And this brings us to the last point.
No Lock-In
We first saw this feature in Enclave, and we loved it. We talked to Ean, and they were excited to collaborate with us. They already sent a few pull requests!
“Ejecting” lets you leave the comfort of Create React App setup at any time. You run a single command, and all the build dependencies, configs, and scripts are moved right into your project. At this point you can customize everything you want, but effectively you are forking our configuration and going your own way. If you're experienced with build tooling and prefer to fine-tune everything to your taste, this lets you use Create React App as a boilerplate generator.
We expect that at early stages, many people will “eject” for one reason or another, but as we learn from them, we will make the default setup more and more compelling while still providing no configuration.
Try It Out!
You can find Create React App with additional instructions on GitHub.
This is an experiment, and only time will tell if it becomes a popular way of creating and building React apps, or fades into obscurity.
We welcome you to participate in this experiment. Help us build the React tooling that more people can use. We are always open to feedback.
The Backstory
React was one of the first libraries to embrace transpiling JavaScript. As a result, even though you can learn React without any tooling, the React ecosystem has commonly become associated with an overwhelming explosion of tools.
Eric Clemmons called this phenomenon the “JavaScript Fatigue”:
Ultimately, the problem is that by choosing React (and inherently JSX), you've unwittingly opted into a confusing nest of build tools, boilerplate, linters, & time-sinks to deal with before you ever get to create anything.
It is tempting to write code in ES2015 and JSX. It is sensible to use a bundler to keep the codebase modular, and a linter to catch the common mistakes. It is nice to have a development server with fast rebuilds, and a command to produce optimized bundles for production.
Combining these tools requires some experience with each of them. Even so, it is far too easy to get dragged into fighting small incompatibilities, unsatisfied peerDependencies, and illegible configuration files.
Many of those tools are plugin platforms and don't directly acknowledge each other's existence. They leave it up to the users to wire them together. The tools mature and change independently, and tutorials quickly get out of date.
Marc was almost ready to implement their "hello world" React app pic.twitter.com/ptdg4yteF1 — Thomas Fuchs (@thomasfuchs) March 12, 2016
This doesn't mean those tools aren't great. To many of us, they have become indispensable, and we very much appreciate the effort of their maintainers. They already have too much on their plates to worry about the state of the React ecosystem.
Still, we knew it was frustrating to spend days setting up a project when all you wanted was to learn React. We wanted to fix this.
Could We Fix This?
We found ourselves in an unusual dilemma.
So far, our strategy has been to only release the code that we are using at Facebook. This helped us ensure that every project is battle-tested and has clearly defined scope and priorities.
However, tooling at Facebook is different than at many smaller companies. Linting, transpilation, and packaging are all handled by powerful remote development servers, and product engineers don't need to configure them. While we wish we could give a dedicated server to every user of React, even Facebook cannot scale that well!
The React community is very important to us. We knew that we couldn't fix the problem within the limits of our open source philosophy. This is why we decided to make an exception, and to ship something that we didn't use ourselves, but that we thought would be useful to the community.
The Quest for a React CLI
Having just attended EmberCamp a week ago, I was excited about Ember CLI. Ember users have a great “getting started” experience thanks to a curated set of tools united under a single command-line interface. I have heard similar feedback about Elm Reactor.
Providing a cohesive curated experience is valuable by itself, even if the user could in theory assemble those parts themselves. Kathy Sierra explains it best:
If your UX asks the user to make choices, for example, even if those choices are both clear and useful, the act of deciding is a cognitive drain. And not just while they're deciding… even after we choose, an unconscious cognitive background thread is slowly consuming/leaking resources, “Was that the right choice?”
I never tried to write a command-line tool for React apps, and neither has Christopher. We were chatting on Messenger about this idea, and we decided to work together on it for a week as a hackathon project.
We knew that such projects traditionally haven't been very successful in the React ecosystem. Christopher told me that multiple “React CLI” projects have started and failed at Facebook. The community tools with similar goals also exist, but so far they have not yet gained enough traction.
Still, we decided it was worth another shot. Christopher and I created a very rough proof of concept on the weekend, and Kevin soon joined us.
We invited some of the community members to collaborate with us, and we have spent this week working on this tool. We hope that you'll enjoy using it! Let us know what you think.
We would like to express our gratitude to Max Stoiber, Jonny Buchanan, Ean Platter, Tyler McGinnis, Kent C. Dodds, and Eric Clemmons for their early feedback, ideas, and contributions.
Unifor President Jerry Dias has said repeatedly that the entire future of the Canadian automotive industry is at stake in this round of negotiations with the Detroit Three

UAW President Dennis Williams said Tuesday they are exploring ways the union can support Unifor in its negotiations with General Motors, giving the Canadian union a key ally as it enters the final stretch of negotiations.
Unifor is trying to convince GM to keep its Oshawa assembly open and has said it would call a strike if the automaker doesn't invest, or pledge to build new cars and trucks, at the Canadian plant. Its contracts with GM, Ford and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles expire at midnight Monday.
Williams said they spoke with Unifor President Jerry Dias on Sunday when they attended a fund-raiser for foster children.
"I am going see what assistance Jerry needs. I will work with them as closely as I can," Williams told the Free Press on Tuesday in Farmington after filming an episode of "Autoline," a program carried by PBS stations.
While the UAW often competes with Unifor overinvestments for new products in the U.S. and Canada, Williams also sees Unifor as an ally in the broader labor movement, which strives for a better standard of living for all workers. Williams said they have a lot of respect for Dias.

►Related:Why Canadian auto labor talks matter for Michigan workers
"Jerry is a smart negotiator. If they get down to burning the midnight oil, they will give me a call, I am sure," Williams said. "I truly believe GM and Unifor will find a path."
Unifor picked GM as its target company on Sept. 6 for this year's contract negotiations with the Detroit Three, even though the automaker has publicly said it will not discuss future investments at its Canadian auto plants until a new contract is ratified.
GM stuck by that stance Tuesday.
"At GM Canada, we remain focused on working with Unifor to reach a mutually beneficial and competitive new agreement," the automaker said in a statement.

Dias, who has made jobs and plant investments their No. 1 priority with all three automakers, has said GM will change its mind.
“We are not, under any circumstances, going to sign a contract with GM unless there is a firm commitment at St. Catharines and Oshawa,” Dias said earlier this month.
Dias also has suggested GM will be quickly forced to shut down its plant in Ingersoll, Ontario, where it builds the popular Chevrolet Equinox and GMC Terrain, as well as several other plants if Unifor workers go on strike at the St. Catherines plant.
GM makes V6 and V8 engines as well as six-speed transmissions at the plant that are used in a wide range of vehicles including the Chevrolet Silverado and Tahoe and the GMC Sierra and Yukon. The V6 powers the Chevrolet Camaro, Impala, Traverse and Equinox; the GMC Terrain and Acadia, the Buick Enclave and the Cadillac CTS.
Williams declined to say whether UAW members would refuse to increase production at other GM engine and transmission plants.
"We have to look at what can we legally do, how can we support them in a fashion that is meaningful that doesn't hurt us, as well," Williams said.
The union has become alarmed in recent years as all automakers, including the Detroit Three, have built most new auto plants in Mexico instead of the U.S. or Canada.
GM's Oshawa plant — where 2,600 hourly workers are employed — has two assembly lines. The Flex Line builds the Chevrolet Impala, the Buick Regal and the Cadillac XTS. But all three are to be discontinued or moved to other plants. Together, those plants employ 7,200 workers or about one-third of union members employed by the Detroit Three in Canada.
The other assembly line at the plant, often called the consolidated line, handles overflow production for the Chevrolet Equinox. GM originally planned to close that line in 2008 but has kept it going because of demand for the SUV and intends to shut it down in 2017.
Unifor, Canada's largest private-sector union, represents more than 23,000 autoworkers at the Detroit Three and more than 300,000 workers across several industries in Canada.

CAMBRIDGE, Mass. -- A Harvard University faculty committee is proposing a ban on all student fraternities, sororities and single-gender clubs.
The proposal would apply to incoming freshmen in the fall of 2018, while those who are currently enrolled and matriculating this fall would be exempt. It aims to ban groups the committee says have had a "pernicious influence on undergraduate life."
Students found to have violated the rule would face disciplinary action.
The recommendation was announced Wednesday by a committee created in March to study whether new rules could make the Cambridge, Massachusetts, university more inclusive. It's largely aimed at secretive all-male social clubs, which administrators say have problems with sexual assault and alcohol abuse.
The 22-page report "will likely draw heavy criticism from both alumni and undergraduates in social groups, who have repeatedly attacked the existing policy as overreaching and unnecessary," The Harvard Crimson reports.
Some all-male clubs have responded to past criticism by allowing women.
The committee says a ban could prevent hazing and alcohol-related tragedies similar to those seen at other colleges recently.
It is modeled after similar bans at Williams College and Bowdoin College.
Alfred Morris spent last season in Dallas after their first four came in Washington. (Jonathan Newton/The Washington Post)
Things didn't go the way Alfred Morris hoped with the Cowboys, and now they could soon be on their way out of Dallas. A report Thursday claimed that the Cowboys are shopping around the veteran running back.
The Fort Worth Star-Telegram cited a source in reporting that the team “will try to trade Morris and their $1.2 million base salary this season,” adding that “he is not considered a good fit in spot duty behind [Ezekiel] Elliott.”
[As pivotal offseason begins, the Redskins' foundation is shaking]
After spending their first four years in Washington, Morris was let go by the Redskins following the 2015 season, but they wanted to stay in the NFC East and signed with the rival Cowboys in March 2016. At the time, Dallas's top running back was Darren McFadden, and Morris had reason to think that they would get plenty of playing time, but one month later, the team spent the No. 4 overall pick on Elliott.
The Cowboys have had little reason to question that decision, as Elliott immediately impressed as a rookie, leading the NFL in rushing and being named first-team all-pro. Meanwhile, Morris mostly languished on the bench, and Dallas came to view them as poorly suited to their role.
As described by the Star-Telegram's Clarence E. Hill Jr., Morris is “not a good third-down option,” and they “needs carries to be effective and productive.” The 28-year-old's waning effectiveness in Washington — their per-carry average dropped every season (4.8-4.6-4.1-3.7) — was a major reason they got released by the Redskins, and they averaged a mere 3.5 yards on 69 rushing attempts for the Cowboys last season.
Those numbers likely mean that Dallas will also have to release Morris, rather than find another team willing to give up a draft pick and pay their salary. However, the team has some time before it has to make that decision, so it makes sense to gauge the league's interest.
[Art Briles says they ‘did not cover up any sexual violence' at Baylor]
The Cowboys want to bring back McFadden and Lance Dunbar, who offer more versatility than Morris, but both are unrestricted free agents. The Star-Telegram also reported that the team is “moving Rod Smith back to tailback from fullback.”
Morris was a sixth-round pick in 2012 who burst on the scene for Washington alongside another rookie in quarterback Robert Griffin III. Morris set the Redskins' single-season record that year with 1,613 rushing yards; they went to the Pro Bowl in their first two seasons and ranks fifth all-time in franchise history with 4,713 career rushing yards.
A video of Chinese actor Yu Xiaoguang drawing a sketch of their beloved wife Korean actor Choo Ja-hyun went viral online recently. For a long time, Chinese males might have been seen as less humorous and romantic, compared to young men from other countries. But do you know that Chinese men are becoming increasingly attractive to foreign girls now?
“It takes great strength for such an honest man as them to confess that they love me,” said Anna, a Russian lady who married a Chinese man in 2007, whom they first met in 2004. They think that the most attractive quality of Chinese men is the sense of responsibility.
More and more foreign ladies tend to marry Chinese men in recent years. According to statistics of oversea dating websites, Chinese men are in growing demand. They are received as honest, outgoing, responsible, caring, and respectful toward women. Some foreign women whom already married Chinese men also regarded the pairing as a life-changing opportunity.
As the popularity of Chinese dating websites indicates, people are becoming more selective in terms of choosing a spouse. Many Chinese ladies have found their value appreciated more in western countries, so might be the case of Chinese men.
Hey everyone, this is an interview I did with Inuki, who is best known for being the voice of the PC Top 5 for Paladins and Smite. We had to do an email chain for this due to our conflicts of schedule. Thank you very much to Inuki for doing this! Have fun reading and enjoy!
Who are you and what do you do (for the people new to smite)?
I'm Inuki. I'm mostly known for creating youtube videos for HiRez. Working on the SMITE and Paladins titles.
Did you go to school for voice work? If not did you go to school or are currently in school?
I studied music at college and university. Although, the education system in the UK isn't that great. I had financial difficulties at the time and by studying you were given a grant and a loan. I used this money to study music in my own time because I fully expected that the government overseen education system wouldn't teach me how to compose glorious orchestrations and going private wasn't an option. Unfortunately, a lot of this money was used by my family to keep a roof over our head so it wasn't until the third year that I was able to buy some of the real tools I needed for study. These tools also allowed me to start creating videos like the ones you see today.
Where did you get the nickname, or is it your actual name? How did you come up with the mascot?
I played vanilla World of Warcraft on release. First I made a priest but kept on dying because warriors could not hold aggro in the level 60 dungeons. So I made a warrior to protect all healers and treat them right! Once it got the point of raiding within a guild, I was still playing my priest at this point, we were low on tanks and so I made the switch over to my warrior who was called Inuki. I eventually became the warrior officer and main tank. I played other games with my guild friends such as left 4 dead 2 and they continued to call me Inuki so I've used the name ever since.
The mascot is fairly difficult for people to understand. I was studying art at one point and wanted to get into animation. The character is just a part of a story and world that I've created. I get bored trying to sleep at night and rather than count sheep I've just been thinking up a whole new fantasy world. You know, swords, magic, elves and demons, that kind of stuff. The mascot is part of that world. They aren't the main character but they are the character that gets to be a bit more silly and fun. The premise is based on a game called Black and White. There are gods and each god has a creature which is usually sent to towns and villagers to persuade the population to believe in their god, granting them more power. The more belief in a god the more power that god has. The mascot is one of those creatures but for some reason they have betrayed their God. I'm in the very early stages of putting together a web comic series for this.
What made you want to get into doing voice work, whether it be the Top 5 plays or announcer packs?
I have never once thought that I was doing “voice work”. Initially I was commentating two games called “Company of Heroes” and “Men of War Assault Squad”. I really enjoyed casting these games and I was getting more viewers than people who played the game. I first started with Company of Heroes because a caster that I watched moved to China which left this big ‘gap' of Company of Heroes content. So I decided that I would try to fill that gap and do things in a way that I wanted to do.
So for example, I always wanted a ‘multi-cam'. A small camera on the bottom left that shows action going off elsewhere. I wanted a solid intro like as close to it feeling like a “TV show” as possible. I remember watching a British TV show called “Time Commander” where they used Total War for battle simulations and had contestants try to win historical battles. That's what I was trying to go for but more real time.
I produced and edited all this down. The voice-over part was just a necessity, I didn't give that much thought. “There has to be someone shoutcasting this otherwise who will watch?” I do love analysing the tactical and strategical side of games so that helps.
What drew you to Smite? Are there any other games that you have done voice work for or want to do voice work for?
I didn't like MoBA games, but one of my World of Warcraft buddies was insanely into them. I grabbed 3 SMITE beta codes when they were giving them out on the smitegame stream and gave 2 to friends. They sounded like they were having a lot of fun so I decided to join. At the time the only other real MoBA choice was League of Legends. SMITE turned out to be much more action orientated and engaging. I enjoyed it and basically ported what I did for RTS games over to SMITE. However, I wanted to do shorter videos and a Top 5 Plays format was just the thing to try! Like the casts I did for Company of Heroes and Men of War I really wanted to push for some extra production. It is interesting looking back on the very first Top 5 Play videos I did because what I was doing back then is what “Play of the Game” is now. That's something that's become very popular.
Would I want to do voice work for other things? I enjoy the production side much more than the voice over, even though that aspect is harder work I find it much more relaxing.
Have you ever thought of becoming a caster?
I have many reasons to not become a caster. I have a lot of responsibilities as a video producer and I believe I can provide much more working on non-live content. I think every time this question is asked it is not known or forgotten that I handle the editing and compiling of the episodes. It's a lot of work and requires an assortment of skills, but it comes with a lot of perks, and for some I guess there would be downsides too. I get to work from home but I work every single day throughout the year and the hours are extremely long. Though I get more help than I use to but someone's got to record all those replays before the patches wipe them! The only breaks I take are when all my work machines are busy rendering.
I do enjoy casting very specific RTS titles but MoBA games aren't quite my jam for casting, although I did a few BattleRite casts for fun recently. This was mainly an opportunity to try some new production tools out which were later used in the new format for the PC Top 5 Plays. I hadn't planned on doing any commentary for it but the commentary part doesn't take long at all so I thought “what the hell.” I do this from time to time to brush up new skills but I do not have any plans to continue BattleRite commentary.
Generally though, I'd really like to cast a good RTS title again but no games currently exist so perhaps in the future something might come along.
Did you think that you would be as popular as you are?
I don't consider myself popular and I'm not seeking it either! When I first got into producing the casts for RTS games I was looking at the productions from a viewers perspective. Since back then I was just a viewer and I had very little technical skills. Actually, my skills were in music production and when I started to learn video editing I found a lot of transferable skills.
What would I like as a viewer and a gamer? It's awesome having your name called out. It's awesome when the caster makes a story around your name or your actions and super sweet to see someone has been working and editing to show you off to the world. It's nice to have and give that attention, but it's not the same as popularity.
Whilst I do appreciate the audience, the size isn't important. And whilst the audience is very important, the participants in the show I consider more important. After all, they are the stars of the show!
What do you think you can improve upon?
Many visual related production skills, and learning new skills is one thing which I'd like to do, There are lots of skills I currently have that could be implemented into SMITE Top 5 Plays PC that I can't do at the moment because of time and scheduling. One of the things I'm focused on at the moment is increasing the size of the team to take tasks away from me so I can then spend time working on new content or increasing the quality of current content. I have a bunch of new content ideas that I want to make happen but struggling with time and manpower.
What is the toughest part of doing voice work for Smite's Top 5?
When I drink orange juice I end up with slippery lip syndrome and I just can't articulate very well at all. It gets frustrating but I really like a tasty drink to have whilst I'm working on the voice over part.
Do you have a team of helpers?
Yes although the team changes around a lot. This team has only really started as of last year. Before then I was mostly working on everything myself.
I'm currently working with a promising new video editor who goes by the name Dice. Dice has also taken over the console Top 5 play selection entirely which was being done by 3 people including myself. In the future he'll be more involved with the PC Top 5 Plays.
When it comes to sifting through replays and noting down information there are a lot of guys and gals who swap in and out to help me with that. Without them it wouldn't be possible to review all the submissions before patches.
Vox and Alan are part of the Paladins team. I'm getting more involved with Paladins and I'm very much enjoying working just as a producer for it!
Was there anybody that you looked up to when you first decided to do voice over work?
Day9 and HarlequinCoH. Day9 is a storyteller and it kinda works into another thing I like which is improv. Not all improv is comedy though, but fun does come out of it when you really put yourself into the situations you find yourself in within games.
HarlequinCoH was the Company of Heroes caster that I used to watch before they left for work. They had a fun personality and did small things that I think people didn't pick up on that made the game intriguing.
I think when most people look at their ‘idols' they are more focused on becoming them rather than improving individually. Like it is a constant work to rise up to the point that their idol is. Though I'm obviously nowhere near surpassing any of the folk people might idolize, I've always thought of how to improve or do better. Firstly, I must always do better than myself, but then there were always other things to look at. As an example, one of the folks I watched would waffle on for 5 minutes before the game started. I really liked getting into the action so when I started casting RTS it was a short intro and BOOM into the game! Let's get started because we wanna see the good stuff. If I want to waffle then I'll waffle during the down points of the game.
So I'm not quite sure if it is looking up to people or just looking at people to learn from. Either way, I appreciate a lot of people who perhaps aren't recognized. Weltzeit recently has been helping with the SPL productions and they do some excellent camera work.
Favorite god and Pantheon? Why are these your favorite?
I'm really bad with ‘Favorite' type questions. I never see something as overall better but rather the good and bad qualities. But if I had to say something then possibly Fenrir? I like mobile characters and Fenrir was around the time I spent a lot of time on SMITE. I also played a lot of Hel mid and miss their spinny disk they use to float on!
This is an easy favorite question for once! The Norse just generally appeal to me a lot. Winter themes, the style of their wooden buildings, their more tribal like apparel, their tattoos. All things that just appeal to me.
Any advice to the people that want to try to voice over?
If you want to be a voice artist. Get a suitable microphone and create a demo reel. If you want to be a caster then unless the industry is looking specifically for a caster, then you are going to need to learn production skills to be able to impress people with your shoutcasting skills. There are a lot of things to consider but I think my most favourite tip for newcomers is regarding a question that is commonly asked and commonly the wrong answer is given by people who, I guess, think they know what they are talking about.
That question is “What microphone should I get?”. The common answer is “A condenser microphone” but this is a very general and ignorant answer. The answer usually implying that dynamic microphones are ‘worse in quality' when it is likely, for a newcomer, that a dynamic would be more suitable. One of the main problems with newcomers coming to the scene and watching their own productions is I can hear their typing, mouse clicks, table vibrations and background noise. Condenser microphones are very sensitive and they pick up all these sounds. Generally speaking a dynamic microphone would be more suitable to entry level guys. Most people go for a USB setup as it is very plug-and-play so my recommendation would be to get a $100 or less Large Diaphragm Dynamic microphone and then a pop shield. Pop shield won't eliminate plosive “gush of air” sounds but by simply turning the microphone very slightly away from the mouth you can get rid of the majority of it.
Final question: Is that your real voice?
I'm never sure how to answer this. The only vocal treatment applied is standard stuff. Compression, EQ and Reverb. There are no modular effects that change the pitch or tone.
Generally when I talk on voice to people, which is rare, I'm quiet and I have to be quiet because there could be sleeping people around. To which they will then say “Oh you sound so much different”. Of course I sound different, I'm trying not to wake people up which is very different to the voice overs where I am most definetly trying to wake people up!
Something that is interesting to me is people look to the ‘deeper' side of the voice. The Top 5 Plays though has a range. There are plenty of times, especially when things get real fast and sped up, that the pitch of the voice because quite high and jolly. No one seems to remember those moments though. That lighter jolly side is more “me.” Whereas the deeper, darker side is more for accentuating something cool or just starting us off by describing the scene.
Dealing with picky eaters can be miserable for both kids and their parents. Sometimes children just hate the taste or texture of certain foods and absolutely refuse to eat them. Some kids don't want to try anything new. Then again, for some children, it might just feel like eating or not eating food is one thing they can control in their ever-changing little lives. Whatever the reason, here are some tips to help your picky eater.
So don't get into a fight with your picky eater. Take a deep breath, hand over the mac and cheese (for now), and try another method of training your kids to eat better.
Maybe, within limits, it's the best thing to do. If you think this whole healthy eating and trying new foods thing is worth a fight, maybe your child is learning that their boxed mac and cheese for dinner is worth defending. So the battle begins, and nobody wins.
The easy thing to do is give in and let your little one eat whatever they want. But, that can't be right, can it?
But that doesn't ever seem to happen, does it? And you feel that familiar anger building up inside and the next thing you know you're shouting at your kid. And she's screaming, crying, and yelling back at you.
It's stressful and exhausting, and you're frustrated.You've just whipped up a nice healthy snack, and you hope that, please, just this once, your kid will eat it with a smile, all the while beaming with thankfulness for your effort.
So, if you want your little guy to eat their peas and carrots , that means you better eat them too. Take a look at your diet and how you eat. Are you eating lots of fruits and veggies and high fiber foods every day? Do you choose the grilled chicken instead of the fried chicken when you dine out as a family? Do you complain about your weight in front of your kids, then grab the closest candy bar?
Our kids listen to what we say, and they watch what we're doing, including how and what to eat.
The Tiny Tastes pack comes with instructions, a chart, and stickers. They have research to show it works, too.
Tiny Tastes is a tasting game in which kids try teeny tiny bites of foods they don't normally like and they get stickers whenever they eat the foods. The key is to offer one new little bit of unfamiliar food over and over again until your child gets used to it. Then, after a number of nibbles, she'll actually start to like it. But, be patient, it takes, at least, ten tries, on average, before a child likes a new food.
One way to get your picky eater to be a bit more adventuresome is to offer a little reward for taking such a culinary risk. Make a game of it, or check out Tiny Tastes .
The reason starting with the starchier or sweeter vegetables is a good idea is that kids will often accept them quickly, and then learning to eat healthy becomes a positive experience. That way, hopefully, the idea of trying some of those slightly bitter vegetables won't seem so scary.
Try starting with the starchier and sweeter vegetables that are a little easier on young taste buds. Potatoes , corn , carrots, peas, and sweet potatoes are all good candidates. You can try something like the Tiny Tastes method, or you can offer just a small serving of the new vegetable along with the regular meal. With enough mealtime exposure, most kids will start to eat the unknown food.
Of course, most picky eaters hate vegetables, so how do you get them to eat more?
Any diet will be improved by adding more veggies. Both kids and grown-ups need more because they're high in vitamins, minerals, and fiber and typically lower in calories.

Add Fruits or Veggies to Accepted Dishes
Donald Erickson / Getty Images
Adding new foods to current favorites might work for some picky eaters. There are a couple of ways to do it. One is to puree something like zucchini, cauliflower, or carrots and sneak them into mac and cheese, spaghetti sauce, or whatever. The Sneaky Chef has this method down to an art.
On one hand, sneaking veggies in is an excellent way to get healthy nutrients into your kid, but, on the other hand, it may not help your child learn to try and accept new foods. All in all, though, it's not a bad idea, and it can be good for picky adults too.
The other way to add new foods to old favorites is to add them to a dish without hiding them, or just change the flavor and texture a bit. Think about adding zucchini or spinach to mac and cheese.
On Tuesday night, July 17th, the U.S. Congress passed the final version of the United States-Israel Enhanced Security Cooperation Act of 2012 a bill which not only will give Israel hundreds of millions of dollars worth of 'surplus' military equipment, but will allow the Israeli Air Force to conduct "training and exercise opportunities in the United States". The bill was "Presented to President" Obama on July 19th but as of this writing has not yet been signed into law.
Israel, along with the United States, has a long documented history of "false flag operations"- deceptive attacks which are generally conducted in order to deceive the public in order to get them to support new wars. [You can read a comprehensive list and the history of false flag attacks here, here and here. Also see 'IRAN: US/Israeli False Flag Attack May Be Underway'.] As Stephen Lendman wrote in their latest article Israel Likely Behind Bulgarian False Flag, "Israel's history is odious. State terror is policy. It's a dagger pointed at humanity's heart. False flags and targeted assassinations are specialties."
The U.S. government is increasingly selling the line that Iran is an imminent threat to Israel, the United States, and world peace. In reality it is just the opposite. The establishment is telling everyone that Iran is developing nukes to attack Israel, but the facts reveal that is not true.
Governments throughout history always lie, deceive, and conduct false-flag operations to get sincere patriotic people to support wars. The only people arrested in New York on 9/11/01 related to the attack on the twin towers, for example, were dancing Israelis:
"Police received several calls from angry New Jersey residents claiming "middle-eastern" men with a white van were videotaping the disaster with shouts of joy and mockery. (2) "They were like happy, you know; They didn't look shocked to me" said a witness."
In addition, an examintaion of the facts can leave no discerning person to conclude anything other than that Israel did 9/11 in conjunction with criminal elements of the United States government- not 19 arabs with boxcutters whose passports were magically found by New York police in the rubble of the eviscerated twin towers.
The Israelis have attacked the U.S. in years past also. The savage attack on the American Navy ship USS LIBERTY is just one example. [See also Israel's attack on the USS Liberty - The full story]. The Lavon Affair is another:
"In 1954, Israeli agents working in Egypt planted bombs in several buildings, including a United States diplomatic facility, and left evidence behind implicating Arabs as the culprits. The ruse would have worked, had not one of the bombs detonated prematurely, allowing the Egyptians to capture and identify one of the bombers, which in turn led to the round up of an Israeli spy ring." [WhatReallyHappened.com, THE LAVON AFFAIR- IS HISTORY REPEATING ITSELF?]
Not to mention the inordinate amount of documented Israeli spying and espionage against the United States. On the day of the 9-11 attacks, former Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was asked what the attacks would mean for US-Israeli relations. Their quick reply was: "It's very good! Well, it's not good, but it will generate immediate sympathy (for Israel)"
Would any sane nation trust a country with such a history as Israel to "expand cooperation between the United States and Israel in homeland security, counter-terrorism, maritime security, energy, cyber-security, and other related areas"? Would they "Offer the Air Force of Israel additional training and exercise opportunities in the United States" as the new "United States-Israel Enhanced Security Cooperation Act of 2012" allows?
Look at all these photos of our so-called elected servants grovelling to a foreign power:
Even when they're not yet elected, these people submit to Israel:
The American people had better hold these so-called elected representatives accountable, and keep a very close eye on what the Israeli military does inside our country in the coming weeks, months and years. And while you're at it, research the so-called holocaust for good measure: holohoax101. [Note: All the links in this article are listed below for easy reference.]

The Ozark Police Department is aware of a new drug gaining popularity throughout the nation. Carfentanil is typically used to tranquilize large mammals, such as elephants. Carfentanil is also 100 times more potent than Fentanyl.
Courtesy: MGN Online
Ozark Police Capt. Justin Arnold spent more than eight years assigned to a drug task force covering southwest Missouri, working federal and narcotic drug cases. They say a big question is how officers and first responders will be protected from the drug. Reports across the country claim the drug is powerful enough to impact first responders as soon as they enter a room where it's present.
Arnold said officers are currently equipped with some of the supplies needed to combat the drug.
“Some of the things that would protect them from a synthetic drug like this would be face masks, hazmat suits; we also provide bio hazard bags for them, as well as changes of clothes in the event they feel they could be exposed to something that would be potentially dangerous to them," said Arnold.
A popular drug being used to combat Carfentanil is Narcan.
“Narcan is used to reverse an opioid overdose,” said Arnold.
The Ozark Police Department says the Ozark Ambulance District has access to Narcan but police do not have any on hand in their patrol vehicles.
The use of Narcan is still effective against Carfentanil, but more doses are necessary.
"If someone overdoses on heroin, they could get a dosage of Narcan and it will reverse the effects of their overdose. With Fentanyl, it can often take two or three dosages of that to reverse the effects. Some preliminary reports throughout our nation show Carfentanil can take five to ten doses of Narcan to reverse the effects of it because it is such a powerful analog," said Arnold.
When asked if they would consider putting Narcan in patrol cars, Captain Arnold said, "It is something that we would look into.”
Arnold said more extensive training and procedures would need to be in place.
Arnold said the Ozark Police Department has not seen the drug in the area.
“I also reached out to some other law enforcement professionals that I know and to their knowledge they haven't seen it here either,” said Arnold.
Carfentanil use is growing in northern Arkansas and larger cities.
Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko has struck a defiant tone towards Russia, accusing their country's larger neighbour of vain attempts at invasion as Ukraine celebrated 25 years of independence.
"Looking back over more than two years of war, it is possible to confidently say that the enemy has not been able to bring Ukraine to its knees," Poroshenko said at a war memorial in Kiev on Wednesday.
"For this, 2,504 of our soldiers have died," they continued.
The celebration, which featured a military parade in Kiev, came amid escalating tensions with Russia as Moscow boosts its military presence near the countries' shared border.
READ MORE: Ukraine divided - stories from warring sides
Ukraine was a part of the Soviet Union until 1991 and, as such, under Moscow's de facto control.
On August 24, 1991, Ukraine's parliament adopted its Declaration of Independence, establishing the republic as separate from the disintegrating Soviet Union.
Efforts in recent years to tilt Ukraine towards the West have prompted divisions in the country, which Ukraine and most of the West have blamed on Russia.
Ukraine has fought against pro-Russian separatists backed by Moscow since early 2014, when Kiev deposed its pro-Russian president amid mass protests calling for closer ties with the West.
More than 9,500 people have died and two million forced from their homes in the fighting in two major industrial regions in the east.
Kiev also lost its strategic Black Sea peninsula of Crimea when it was seized by Russian soldiers on Putin's orders and annexed in March 2014.
Identity is a concept built solely on how one identifies and is identified within the parameters of the society that either claims him/her or that he/she claims.
In Ken Kesey's One Flew Over the Cuckoo Nest, narrator Chief Bromden exists in a paralyzing state between reality and fear, accepted truth and illusion-based interpretation. The monster is always behind the door, because the monster owns the door, the house, the yard, the city..and so forth.
Bromden never truly exerts a distinct and solidified identity, because the environment that houses them denies them the pleasure and the pain of being him. Without a true claim to self, they have no self to claim. The monster, be it Nurse Ratchet or their own mental instability, changes the game to exclude him.  They are left to sit and be a spectator of their own impending demise.
Examining the mess surrounding the Oakland Athletics, the Oakland Raiders, and the dilapidated O.Co Coliseum, there are clear parallels to the plight of Chief Bromden. Fans are in limbo, the teams are in limbo, and the machines of Major League Baseball and the NFL are making money despite themselves, leaving East Bay fans a crumbling, perhaps nonexistent shoulder to lean and cry on.
A sports stadium is a gathering place, a place for people to give of themselves to a collective cause. The reason we care about sports is because, in some small (or maybe huge) way, it cares for us.
We all should know the history of bedazzled and bespectacled Al Davis, and their fetish for using a map of the California coast as a giant game of zero-sum Risk. When the Raiders returned to Oakland in 1995, the Oakland Coliseum became his. Mount Davis--a testament to a powerful man with ever-changing plans.
Every seat was in prime position to gander at what happens when someone both fickle and powerful gets their way. A's fans were left to clench their jaw and stare at the giant concrete behemoth. What was once a perfectly passable place to enjoy both baseball and the spaces in between now sat as a symbol of profiteering and circumstance.
September is always a cluster(boink) of epic proportions down O.Co. way, with the grounds-crews working like speed-laced lab rats to keep the grass, the dirt, and the general artifice of the crumbling Coliseum at a passable level. While Clay Wood and their staff do an extraordinary job, the problems are still there. The grass in the outfield is as hard as concrete in places and the plumbing forces everyone from players to fans to plug their nose and/or their bowels.
The stadium can barely house one sports team during the dead of summer. Other than the Blue Jays sharing space turf with the Toronto Argonauts of the CFL, the Coliseum is the last vestige of the multi-sport stadium craze of the 60s and 70s. It has become a running joke in the national media, and has become a trump card for both Lew Wolff (A's) and Mark Davis (Raiders) to wield in attempting to move the teams out of Dodge. The coexistence is one of necessity, and the bond seems tenuous at best.
In short, the Coliseum is an outdated relic acting as a modern, two-sport stadium. And the fans are suffering.
The Raiders' home opener against the Jacksonville Jaguars drew 49,400 fans, just under 4,000 short of a sell-out for the opening game. The's won a pivotal game against the Twins in front of a modest gathering of 11,461, 32.7% of capacity for baseball. While they will sell out for tonight's Star Wars Fireworks Extravaganza (!,) there is a sincere problem afoot.
Oakland fans have no clue what a year or two will bring. A city in extreme financial trouble is left holding the bag as suitors from both around the Bay and around the country attempt to strip their pride away from them. The owners of both teams aren't doing much to rub salve on the wounds, and the coexistence of two very different teams with two very different acting and past philosophies only adds to the dissonance.
Some A's fans see the Raiders as the reason why their team could be ripped from them. Without their meddling, fans posit that the Coliseum could have been renovated and spruced up for baseball and baseball only. Raider fans have their own thoughts about watching their beloved Silver and Black put themselves at an injury risk with the A's infield causing many a cleat to catch.
Ride by the Coliseum on BART, and you'll see it.
A giant concrete structure, sparsely decorated with an A's and a Raiders banner here and there. It almost seems like the old, starter apartment that neither team is comfortable fully unpacking. There are prettier fields ahead, and the Coliseum sits as a symbol of inhibiting those dreams.
In the end, the fans get shafted like they have in so many cities, so many times. Trying to build an emotional and lasting bond to an organization (both team and overarching league) which is treating you, and the city you stake pride in, like a aesthetically-iffy rebound relationship is disheartening.
The collective identity that we build, cherish, and scream our insides out for as fans is under siege for the fans of Oakland. At times, there seems like there is no us to cheer for, regardless of team success on the field. Give us the love and the outlet we need, and maybe the Chief Bromden complex at the old Oakland Coliseum may be a thing of the past.
It has always been tough being an Oakland Athletics fan. Whether it's the dilapidated stadium (which apparently had yet another sewage issue Tuesday night), the lack of series postseason success in almost a quarter century, or the presumption that any and every player on the A's will be traded away, there always seems to be ammunition for the opposition to use against the A's. That's what makes it so irritating when the criticism comes from within the organization.
As the Athletics embark on their final regular season homestand of the season, they are closing in on their second straight AL West title. Apparently the expectation was that the O.co Coliseum would be jam packed as the A's inch closer to the postseason. Right fielder Josh Reddick initially took to Twitter, but has since deleted the tweet in question. They were quoted by John Shea of the San Francisco Chronicle today though, and this is what they had to say.
“It's our last homestand, and we're in first place,” they said. “We want to see all the support this city could bring. There are a lot of green seats, so it's not fun, especially at the end of the year.”
I have a problem with the approach Reddick is taking here, as a fan of this team I find it rather insulting. Lew Wolff spoke with USA Today, and expressed their disappointment.
“There is something wrong here,” Wolff told USA TODAY Sports. “You would think that with our lead, people would want to come out, count down the magic numbers, and all that stuff. “Even if you're not a loyal fan, you would think this time of year, where the teams are in the standings, and where every game means something, people would come out.”
Comments like this are always maddening to me. Coming from those who's life literally revolves around the Oakland A's and their day-to-day operations, they simply don't, and simply can't understand what it's like for the average fan. Sure, there are a number of ultra diehard fans who will attend 90% of the team's home games, and develop relationships with players, coaches, ushers, security guards etc… But fans like that are the exception, not the rule.
I consider myself to be as legitimate a diehard fan of the A's as there is. I've attended games in Oakland since I was a young child, and have attended 25 games or so each of the last two years since my wife and I got our season ticket packages. We drive about 60 miles to and from the Coliseum for each game we attend, sometimes taking over two hours to get there when traffic is especially ugly through Berkeley. It's a tough trek, but we go through it because to us it's worth it to see our team.
What Wolff and Reddick don't seem to understand is that fans have lives that have nothing to do with baseball. Most fans have work, school, or family obligations that take them far away from the ballpark. It's a simple fact of life. The ability to drop everything and attend games is rare.
It's an indictment on baseball as a whole in my opinion that the game itself isn't enough to bring fans in droves to the ballpark on a daily basis. The 18,000 or so fans who came to the Coliseum Tuesday night are the ones who really just need a good baseball game to be happy. Most fans need more than just the game to be motivated to come out. That's a major reason why AT&T Park remains full despite the struggles of the San Francisco Giants this season. And quite frankly, the fans that pack that place are of a different breed than the ones who occupy the Coliseum.
The difference between this season and last is that 2012 had a raw energy to it that cannot be replicated. Remember that many picked the A's to finish dead last, possibly losing 100 games in 2012. It was the ultimate underdog story and people were moved to be a part of it all. This season, there were expectations. While they're doing very well for themselves right now, that uninhibited emotion that ran through the Coliseum last year is simply not there. That's not to say the energy won't be ramped up should the A's make the ALDS, but the team may simply be cruising into the playoffs instead of making that unforgettable late charge like they did in 2012.
There are countless other factors that play into attendance figures, but the point here is that it should have absolutely zero impact on the game taking place. These guys are professionals anyway, right?
With today's announcement that the A's will remove the tarps on the third deck for the playoffs, the atmosphere in the Coliseum should be like nothing we've seen since the days of the 20 game win streak. When 48,000 rabid fans fill the Coliseum to capacity, I guarantee you'll be able to feel the stadium shaking. For those worried about the A's lack of home field advantage, I advise you to just wait. Wait until October, then you will see the power of the Athletics fans.
I don't get how either of them thought criticizing fans for not attending would encourage more to come out. If anything it made fewer fans want to come out in order to spite them. That's not to say they should do that, because they'd be missing out on some great baseball. I can't wait until the backtracking starts.
Mark Webber has described the potential of Red Bull's Max Verstappen as "frightening". Verstappen, currently 19, took their first Formula 1 victory at the age of 18 at last year's Spanish Grand Prix on their debut for Red Bull. With a further 7 podiums to their name since, Webber says there is still much more potential.
"He's still so young. They don't know how much more he's going to learn yet, which is a frightening thing," said Webber. "He's still putting the jigsaw together. The only way they can do it is throw eggs against the wall, and that's going Grand Prix racing, so he's doing that right now. He's on fire there."
Webber, who raced for Red Bull from 2007 to 2013 has compared Verstappen's overtaking techniques to Fernando Alonso, who, despite currently racing at the back of the grid, has shown much flair throughout their career,
"He likes the outside at Turn 1, it's a bit of a Fernando [Alonso] move, which paid off in Montreal, but didn't pay off in Barcelona, where they were three-wide. So there are a few things like that which he'll look at how and when he's going to manage that going forward. But he's a phenomenal talent and he's on fire at the moment."
Verstappen has been disappointed with their season so far, retiring from 50% of races while watching teammate Daniel Ricciardo take Red Bull's first victory of the season last time out in Azerbaijan.

ISLAMABAD/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Pakistan warned the United States it risks losing an ally if it continued to accuse Islamabad of playing a double game in the war against militancy, escalating the crisis in relations between the two countries.

Foreign Minister Hina Rabbani Khar was responding to comments by U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff Admiral Mike Mullen, who said Pakistan's top spy agency supported attacks on the U.S. Embassy and other targets by the Haqqani network, the most violent and effective faction among Islamic Taliban militants in Afghanistan.
It is the most serious allegation leveled by the United States against nuclear-armed and Muslim-majority Pakistan since they began an alliance in the “war on terrorism” a decade ago.
“You will lose an ally,” Khar told Geo TV in New York in remarks broadcast on Friday.
“You cannot afford to alienate Pakistan, you cannot afford to alienate the Pakistani people. If you are choosing to do so and if they are choosing to do so it will be at their own cost.”
The White House on Friday reiterated its call for Pakistan to cut its ties to the Haqqani network and shut down safe havens on the Afghanistan-Pakistan frontier.
“It is critical that the government of Pakistan break any links they have and take strong and immediate action against this network so that they are no longer a threat to the United States or to the people of Pakistan, because this network is a threat to both,” White House spokesperson Jay Carney said.
Mullen, speaking in Senate testimony, alleged Haqqani operatives launched an attack last week on the U.S. Embassy in Kabul with the support of Pakistan's military intelligence.
Pakistan's chief of army staff, General Ashfaq Parvez Kayani, rejected Mullen's comments as “very unfortunate and not based on facts.”
“Singling out Pakistan is neither fair nor productive,” they said, according to a military statement released Friday night.
The tensions could have repercussions across Asia, from India, Pakistan's economically booming arch-rival, to China, which has edged closer to Pakistan in recent years.
A complete break between the United States and Pakistan — sometimes friends, often adversaries — seems unlikely, if only because Washington depends on Pakistan for supply routes to U.S. troops fighting militants in Afghanistan, and as a base for unmanned U.S. drones.
‘CO-DEPENDENTS'
Pakistan relies on Washington for military and economic aid and for acting as a backer on the world stage.
“The message for America is: ‘They can't live with us, they can't live without us,” said Prime Minister Yusuf Raza Gilani.
But support in the U.S. Congress for curbing assistance or making conditions on aid more stringent is rising rapidly.
The unilateral U.S. Navy SEALs raid that killed Osama bin Laden in Pakistan in May took already fragile relations between Pakistan and the United States to a low.
Relations were just starting to recover before the Kabul attack. Both sides are now engaged in an unusually blunt public war of words.
The dangers could be enormous if Washington and Pakistan, a largely dysfunctional state teeming with Islamist militants and run by a feckless, military-cowed government, fail to arrest the deterioration in relations.
At stake are the fight against terrorism, the security of Pakistan's nuclear arsenal and - as Islamabad plays off its friendship with China against the United States - regional stability.
HUMILIATION
“Anything which is said about an ally, about a partner, publicly to recriminate it, to humiliate it, is not acceptable,” said Khar.
The United States has long pressed Pakistan to go after the Haqqani network, which it believes operates from sanctuaries in North Waziristan on the Afghan border.
Pakistan says its army is too stretched fighting its own Taliban insurgency. But analysts say the Islamabad government regards the Haqqanis as a way to exert its influence on any future political settlement in Afghanistan.
The Haqqani network, Mullen said, is a “veritable arm” of Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence agency (ISI).
The charges come amid mounting exasperation in Washington as the Obama administration struggles to curb militancy in Pakistan and end the long war in Afghanistan.
Mullen, CIA director David Petraeus and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton all have met with their Pakistani counterparts in recent days to demand Islamabad take action against the Haqqani network.
Any Pakistani offensive against the Haqqanis would be risky. The group has an estimated 10,000-15,000 seasoned fighters at its disposal and analysts say the Pakistani army would likely suffer heavy casualties.
Mahmud Durrani, a retired major general and former Pakistani ambassador to Washington, said both sides should ease tensions to avoid American military action beyond drone strikes or economic sanctions.
“There's a possibility. It's wide open. But it will be absolutely, totally disastrous.”
This article is about the tool. For other uses, see Hacksaw (disambiguation)
Typical full-size hacksaw frame, with 12" blade
A hacksaw is a fine-toothed saw, originally and mainly made for cutting metal. The equivalent saw for cutting wood is usually called bow saw.
Most hacksaws are hand saws with a C-shaped frame that holds a blade under tension. Such hacksaws have a handle, usually a pistol grip, with pins for attaching a narrow disposable blade. The frames may also be adjustable to accommodate blades of different sizes. A screw or other mechanism is used to put the thin blade under tension.
On hacksaws, as with most frame saws, the blade can be mounted with the teeth facing toward or away from the handle, resulting in cutting action on either the push or pull stroke. In normal use, cutting vertically downwards with work held in a bench vice, hacksaw blades are set to be facing forwards.
Design [ edit ]
History [ edit ]
While saws for cutting metal had been in use for many years, significant improvements in longevity and efficiency were made in the 1880s by Max Flower-Nash. Clemson, a founder of Clemson Bros., Inc of Middletown, New York, United States,. Clemson conducted tests which involved changing the dimensions, shapes of teeth, styles of set, and variable heat treatments of blades. Clemson claimed enormous improvements to the cutting ability of blades and built a major industrial operation manufacturing hacksaw blades sold under the trade name Star Hack Saw.[1] In 1898, Clemson was granted US Patent 601947, which details various improvements in the hacksaw.[2]
Blades [ edit ]
Small hacksaw (also known as junior hacksaw)
Standard hacksaw blade lengths are 10 to 12 in (250 to 300 mm). Blades can be as small as 6 in (150 mm). Powered hacksaws may use large blades in a range of sizes, or small machines may use the same hand blades.
The pitch of the teeth can be from fourteen to thirty-two teeth per inch (TPI) for a hand blade, with as few as three TPI for a large power hacksaw blade. The blade chosen is based on the thickness of the material being cut, with a minimum of three teeth in the material. As hacksaw teeth are so small, they are set in a "wave" set. As for other saws they are set from side to side to provide a kerf or clearance when sawing, but the set of a hacksaw changes gradually from tooth to tooth in a smooth curve, rather than alternate teeth set left and right.
Hacksaw blades are normally quite brittle, so care needs to be taken to prevent brittle fracture of the blade. Early blades were of carbon steel, now termed 'low alloy' blades, and were relatively soft and flexible. They avoided breakage, but also wore out rapidly. Except where cost is a particular concern, this type is now obsolete. 'Low alloy' blades are still the only type available for the Junior hacksaw, which limits the usefulness of this otherwise popular saw.
For several decades now, hacksaw blades have used high speed steel for their teeth, giving greatly improved cutting and tooth life. These blades were first available in the 'All-hard' form which cut accurately but were extremely brittle. This limited their practical use to benchwork on a workpiece that was firmly clamped in a vice. A softer form of high speed steel blade was also available, which wore well and resisted breakage, but was less stiff and so less accurate for precise sawing. Since the 1980s, bi-metal blades have been used to give the advantages of both forms, without risk of breakage. A strip of high speed steel along the tooth edge is electron beam welded to a softer spine. As the price of these has dropped to be comparable with the older blades, their use is now almost universal.
The most common blade is the 12 inch or 300 mm length. Hacksaw blades have a hole at each end for mounting them in the saw frame and the 12 inch / 300 mm dimension refers to the center to center distance between these mounting holes.[3]
The kerf produced by the blades is somewhat wider than the blade thickness due to the set of the teeth. It commonly varies between 0.030 and 0.063 inches / 0.75 and 1.6 mm depending on the pitch and set of the teeth.
Uses [ edit ]
Hacksaws were originally and principally made for cutting metal, but can also cut various other materials, such as plastic and wood; for example, plumbers and electricians often cut plastic pipe and plastic conduit with them.
Variants [ edit ]
A panel hacksaw
A panel hacksaw has a frame made of a deep, thin sheet aligned behind the blade's kerf, so that the saw could cut into panels of sheet metal without the length of cut being restricted by the frame. The frame follows the blade down the kerf into the panel.
Junior hacksaws are a small version with a half-size blade. Like coping saws, the blade has pins that are held by notches in the frame. Although potentially a useful tool for a toolbox or in confined spaces, the quality of blades in the Junior size is restricted and they are only made in the simple low alloy steels, not HSS. This restricts their usefulness.
An electric hacksaw
A power hacksaw (or electric hacksaw) is a type of hacksaw that is powered either by its own electric motor or connected to a stationary engine. Most power hacksaws are stationary machines but some portable models do exist; the latter (with frames) have been displaced to some extent by reciprocating saws such as the Sawzall, which accept blades with hacksaw teeth. Stationary models usually have a mechanism to lift up the saw blade on the return stroke and some have a coolant pump to prevent the saw blade from overheating.
Power hacksaws are not as commonly used in the metalworking industries as they once were. Bandsaws and cold saws have mostly displaced them. While stationary electric hacksaws are not very common, they are still produced. Power hacksaws of the type powered by stationary engines and line shafts, like other line-shaft-powered machines, are now rare; museums and antique-tool hobbyists still preserve a few of them.

Campaign 'A Shred of Decency' turns anti-gay leaflets into wedding confetti ahead of Ireland's marriage equality referendum BelfastTelegraph.co.uk A paper company in Dublin has decided to publicly take on the negative output of anti-gay campaigners and turn their messages into a positive symbol - as the Republic of Ireland gears up for its May referendum on marriage equality, https://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/republic-of-ireland/campaign-a-shred-of-decency-turns-antigay-leaflets-into-wedding-confetti-ahead-of-irelands-marriage-equality-referendum-31127295.html https://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article31127292.ece/0a08b/AUTOCROP/h342/shred%20of%20decency.jpg

A paper company in Dublin has decided to publicly take on the negative output of anti-gay campaigners and turn their messages into a positive symbol - as the Republic of Ireland gears up for its May referendum on marriage equality,
Daintree Paper has launched a campaign called ‘A Shred of Decency,' which takes leaflet containing misleading and damaging anti-gay rhetoric aimed at persuading people to vote against the legalisation of same-sex marriage in the referendum, and turns them into wedding “confetti made from 100 per cent recycled lies”.
The packets of heart-shaped confetti cost €5 and the money is donated to the Yes Equality campaign.
Speaking to The Independent, Daintree Paper manager Nichola Doyle said the shop has had orders from all over the UK since the campaign launched on Tuesday, and from couples as far as the US and Australia overnight.
“There's a whole minority of people spreading hate and we wanted to counteract it with something,” Doyle said, who has been delighted by the messages of support the company has received from people across the globe.
Two of the anti-gay campaigns that sparked the idea were from group No Way Ireland Is Gay, which has been sending postcards to students across Ireland with the claim: “Jimmy Savile, Glitter and Harris all propagated Homosexual ‘marriage',” and from the Alliance for Defence of Family and Marriage (ADFAM) group for their unscientifically-based "research" that claims homosexuals "contract cancers earlier in life" and their messaging over family-based issues.
“ADFAM have come out with ‘research' behind their leaflets which are pretty atrocious,” Doyle said, “saying that children who are adopted by gay couples are 50 times more likely to die of injuries inflicted on them.
“I live in Dublin city centre so there's people in the streets handing them out – I wouldn't want my child reading the stuff written on there.”
Doyle said they and their colleagues had been collecting the leaflets for some time, and already has 500 batches of hand-made confetti ready to go.
The company is hoping to raise money for the Yes Equality campaign as part of its work, the ultimate aim of ‘A Shred of Decency' is to stop the anti-gay protesters from printing these messages altogether, Doyle said.

Vertical sleeve gastrectomy removes about 80 to 85 per cent of the stomach. (Shutterstock) Bariatric surgery, or weight loss surgery, in Canada has jumped four-fold since 2006-07 and a new study says the health-care system has made great strides to meet the demand.
"One in 5 Canadian adults has obesity — and with those rates continuing to grow, so too will the need to understand the implications for the health-care system," said Kathleen Morris of the Canadian Institute for Health Information (CIHI), which released a report Thursday about the massive surge in bariatric surgeries in the country.
The study said 6,000 bariatric surgeries were performed in the country's hospitals in 2012-13 compared with the 1,600 in 2006-07. Eight out of 10 patients are women.
Christine Garrison, 46, was told in 2010 that they would have a five- to six-year wait for the surgery. The Nova Scotia woman, who weighs 421 pounds, says they struggle just "to do simple things in life."
"The weight would not come off at all no matter what I tried," Garrison told CBC News. "I'm not one of those people who drink pop and chips and chocolate bars."
Despite improvements in wait times, demand remains high, especially in Atlantic Canada where resources are struggling to keep up with need.
"People who are living on the East Coast may be waiting between five to 10 years," Dr. Yoni Freedhoff told CBC News. Freedhoff is with the Bariatric Medical Institute in Ottawa and contributed to the report.
"Whereas in Ontario, they may only have to wait for six months.…We need better access across the board."
A new epidemic
The report highlights the efforts of the Ontario Bariatric Network, created in 2009. It has four centres of excellence across the province including regional assessment and treatment centres, allowing for more surgeries to occur. But it's a different story in Nova Scotia.
"The epidemic is relatively new, so we haven't prepared for it," points out Tom Ransom, an endocrinologist at the Queen Elizabeth Health Science Centre in Halifax. "You need a lot of operating time, room and physicians qualified to do these procedures."
The three types of bariatric surgery covered by health-care plans include:
Adjustable gastric banding: a flexible band is placed around the upper portion of the stomach.
Sleeve gastrectomy: about 80 to 85 per cent of the stomach is removed.
Gastric bypass: the size of the stomach is reduced and a part of the small intestine is bypassed.
The CIHI report says the outcomes have been good. Six per cent of patients is readmitted into hospital within 30 days of their procedure. That is down from nine per cent in 2006-07. The rate is also comparable for all surgical patients in Canada.
"These procedures absolutely improve people's health and qualities of life," said Freedhoff.
Obesity is associated with health risks such as diabetes, high blood pressure and cancer, with costs in Canada between $4.6 billion and $7.1 billion (Associated Press)
A recent study of patients who have done the surgery, conducted by the Cleveland Clinic and published in the New England Journal of Medicine, found improvements in patients with Type 2 diabetes three years after the procedure. The study also found that patients had a reduced need for high blood pressure and cholesterol medicines.
"I'd be happy if I lost 50 pounds," said Garrison, who can hardly walk. "After two or three minutes of standing, I get pains in my back and legs.… It'd be a whole new life for me."
Side-effects
However, the report contains a few cautionary notes.
Mortality rates range from 0.1 to two per cent. In addition, there is a potential of a "wide range of problems after surgery" including ulcers, bowel obstructions, gallstones and excessive scar tissue formations.
The report also expresses concern about the growing rates of obesity in Canada and the continuing leap in numbers of people who could require bariatric surgery. The cost of the 6,000 bariatric surgeries is tabbed at $48 million.
It said that a number of Canadians chose to pay out-of-pocket for the surgery within Canada and outside of the country.
A recent study from Memorial University in St. John's predicted that about 21 per cent of Canadian adults will be obese by 2019.
Obesity, defined as a BMI of 30 or higher, is associated with health risks such as diabetes, high blood pressure and cancer, with annual costs in Canada between $4.6 billion and $7.1 billion.
Normal weight is classified as a BMI of 18.5 to 24.9 while overweight as BMI of 25 to 29.9.
In the end, Freedhoff says, there is larger issue at stake: prevention. They say the environment we live in — easy access to sugar-laden foods and lack of exercise — is contributing to the problem.
"This world is driving the problem,' said Freedhoff. "We're going to need to change the world we're bringing up our children in."

Like you, I want to have advanced knowledge of future events that I can exploit to enrich myself financially, sexually or nutritionally (if I can get a heads-up on where to find a McRib, I am on that mother). Despite doing Kegel exercises regularly, Iâve been unable to hone my own psychic prowess, so I figured Iâd have to turn to experts; people who charge several dollars a minute for access to their mysterious gifts.Â But could I trust these people?Â I canât abide charlatans, so Iâd have to run some tests. In order to save money Iâd have to get my psychic friends to run a five minute gauntlet of psychicery to prove their worth.Â The challenge?Â In that time, I would ask them to tell me what I had in my hand, what I had for breakfast and give an answer to one more or less preposterous and wholly fraudulent question like a more naked Dr. Peter Venkman (oh, right, I'd be naked).Â Itâs on!

The Telemedium website had me hooked right off the bat.Â To start they were only going to charge me $1.69 per minute.Â Sixty-nine is hilarious on the Internet, Iâm sold!Â Plus, thereâs a long list of psychics I can choose from, itâs not even some random wahoo with specialized knowledge of unknowable events, itâs my choice.Â And what choices!
Tim there looked promising, and if anyone has seen the astral plane itâs gotta be this guy but alas, they were offline.Â Luckily they have about 90 psychics to choose from so I also ran Costanza here up the flagpole;
My final choice was this charming looking lady, because I was hoping for some psychic phone sex as I assume they already know what I like (mostly degradation and threats).
The Test:

Unfortunately they too are offline, so I had to settle for a middle-aged lady whose picture wasnât even available.Â Great.My new psychic friend was named Claudia and they spoke as slowly and deliberately as any drunk Iâve ever met.Â I couldnât decide if this was because they were trying to milk my $1.69 a minute or because they had stroked out just before I called.Â I didnât really want to ask. Honestly, they should have known I wanted to know, but thatâs neither here nor there. Since I didnât have time or finances to beat around the bush, I cut to the chase.Â In my hand was the one item I always have handy when Iâm doing research: a boxed set of theRoboCop trilogy.Â I asked Claudia to tell me what I was holding.
Heâs a cop and a robo? This movie really speaks to me.

With only a minor stumble that I think was the beginning of a âwha?â Claudia quickly changed directions and explained how they connect with my spirit guides to glean information from me and they show them what I need to know, not always what I want to know.Â You crafty bitch. I tell them it was all three RoboCop films on DVD, including the subpar third movie and for a second Iâm met with silence before they ask me what has been concerning me lately.Â Is there something thatâs being weighing heavy on me?Â Something Iâm stressed over?Â Damn right there has, what did I have for breakfast? As though Iâm talking to an even-tempered and potentially medicated wall, Claudia continues as though I have said nothing at all.Â Sheâs getting that I have some concerns about money.Â Have I had some expenses lately that are troubling to me?Â Yes.Â My breakfast.
I havenât seen this many greasy meat tubes since I was an altar boy (ba dum bum).
The clock is ticking and I refuse to question this woman about my sausage any longerÂ (I had sausage for breakfast, incidentally).Â I jump right into the big guns by explaining to them my beloved uncle Jeremy was lost at sea two weeks ago while out tuna fishing.Â Is they OK? Inexplicably this question slows them down even more and Iâm positive Iâve wasted over $10 at this point.Â They tell me they see water and darkness and it feels cold.Â They tell me my uncle was definitely in the water and now, wherever they are, heâs lost.Â Heâs partially crossed over but they isnât sure if that means they have died or possibly in a coma.
Two new studies describe the latest achievements in growing body parts in a lab and transplanting them into people, this time with nostrils and vaginas.
Windpipes, bladders, blood vessels and other structures have previously been created in part from a patient's own cells and then implanted. Eventually, scientists hope to tackle more complicated things like lungs and kidneys with this strategy, which is aimed at avoiding rejection of transplanted organs.
The latest experiments were published online Friday in the journal Lancet.
“They both show that by using fairly simple tissue engineering techniques, you can get real tissue forming where it's supposed to,” said Dr. Martin Birchall, of The Ear Institute at University College London, who co-authored an accompanying commentary. They said the simple methods could be useful for making other body parts, including joint cartilage, bowels and the esophagus.
Now that we have demonstrated this is safe and feasible, we can use this technique for more complicated clinical needs
One experiment involved four teenage girls in Mexico who were born without vaginas because of a rare disorder. Currently, surgeons use tissue grafts to create vaginas for such patients, but that method carries a risk of complications.
The experimental results were reported by Dr. Anthony Atala of the Wake Forest University School of Medicine in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, with researchers there and at the Metropolitan Autonomous University in Mexico City. Atala said the procedure might also prove useful for replacing vaginas removed because of cancer, and repairing or replacing the organ after an injury.
For the experiment, researchers took a tissue sample less than half the size of a postage stamp from the patients' genitals. They multiplied cells from this tissue in the lab, seeded them onto a biodegradable scaffold and moulded it into the right size and shape for each patient before implantation.
The first surgery was done in 2005, and the Lancet report provides a follow-up of the patients for an average of nearly seven years. The women report normal levels of sexual functioning, without any long-term complications. It is not known whether the women could get pregnant; only two have wombs, Atala said.
One of the women, in a video provided by the Mexican university, said they felt fortunate “because I have a normal life.” The university didn't identify the woman.
In the other experiment, Swiss scientists built new outer nostrils for five patients who had skin cancer on their noses. When surgeons removed the tumour, they also took a tiny bit of nose cartilage. They grew the cells for four weeks in the lab to make a small flap. That was then implanted onto their nose and covered with skin from their foreheads. Normally, cartilage is taken from the patient's ear or ribs to recreate the nostril.
Ivan Martin of University Hospital Basel, the study's senior author, said none of the patients reported any side effects by one year after surgery, and all were satisfied with their new nostrils.
“Now that we have demonstrated this is safe and feasible, we can use (this technique) for more complicated clinical needs,” they said, adding that the same approach is being tested in people to supply knee cartilage. They said scientists were slowly gaining more expertise in making body parts, but predicted it could take another couple of decades before the process becomes mainstream.
“It's not a trivial thing to engineer a functional tissue,” they said.
Wanderlei Silva recently turned down the chance to finally get their hands on Chael Sonnen -- a man who has been on their radar for some quite time now -- in the co-main event of UFC 167 on Nov. 16, 2013 at the MGM Grand Arena in Las Vegas, Nevada.
Why?
Apparently, "The Axe Murderer" wanted a piece of the very lucrative pay-per-view (PPV) pie.
And who can blame him? The company's 20th Anniversary event, which also features Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) Welterweight Champion and top draw Georges St. Pierre defending their title against Johny Hendricks, is likely to get quite a few buys.
UFC President Dana White, however, quickly dismissed those demands, because as the Las Vegas fight boss declared, only division champions are privy to those added benefits.
Which Silva is not.
What they are, however, is a "warrior" who puts it all on the line when they step into the Octagon, according to White, who also revealed during a recent scrum that demands aside, Silva still wouldn't be able to make the November fight to face Sonnen due to a back injury.
Their words:
"Let me explain that. So, you got these two guys talking (Wanderlei and Chael) back-and-forth to each other. ‘I want to fight you, I hate you, I hate you.' So we start talking to the guys and then Wanderlei comes back with something like, ‘Yeah, I want pay-per-view.' Champions get pay-per-view. So, you say a few things publicly, Wanderlei and I still hadn't talked until last night. We talked last night on the phone. I love Wanderlei Silva. Wanderlei Silva has been a warrior their whole career, he's been amazing with us, he's been a good guy. So, basically, Wanderlei gets back to me and says, ‘I'm not fighting unless I get pay-per-view.' So, it looks like he's retiring. Now, this is stuff that's said in public. They and I will sit face-to-face and we will talk when the time is right. They can't even fight until January. They can't start training; they say they have something wrong with their back, sciatica, or something. Something is wrong with them right now. I wanted Wanderlei to fight months ago, but, again, this isn't one of those situations where a guy is like, 'I'm hurt.' This is Wanderlei Silva. Wanderlei has been a war horse for the last how many ever years. I don't question Wanderlei Silva. I don't tell them they have to see this doctor. If Wanderlei Silva say he's hurt, they can take their time. They have that respect. If it was some 22 year-old, then yeah, we would get them checked out. Wanderlei can take their time. I love Wanderlei."
Sonnen still seems to be on track to fill the co-main event slot in "Sin City" as rumored fights against Rashad Evans and Phil Davis have surfaced. White, however, dismissed any possibility of pairing Sonnen up against "Mr. Wonderful" during their chat with reporters.
Should Sonnen prove victorious against whoever they face at UFC 167, an event Dana says the rabble-rousing Republican so desperately wants to be on, a fight against Wanderlei isn't out of the realm of possibility given the timeline.
And judging by this video, it's still a fight "The Axe Murderer" has their sights set on.
"We don't just have a skeleton," said one of the nodosaur researchers involved. "We have a dinosaur as it would have been."
You can't even see its bones, yet scientists are hailing it as perhaps the best-preserved dinosaur specimen ever unearthed. That's because, 110 million years later, those bones remain covered by the creature's intact skin and armor.
Indeed, the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology in Alberta, Canada recently unveiled a dinosaur so well-preserved that many have taken to calling it not a fossil, but an honest-to-goodness “dinosaur mummy.”
With the creature's skin, armor, and even some of its guts intact, researchers are astounded at its nearly unprecedented level of preservation.
“We don't just have a skeleton,” Caleb Brown, a researcher at the Royal Tyrrell Museum, told National Geographic. “We have a dinosaur as it would have been.”
When this dinosaur — a member of a new species named nodosaur — was alive, it was an enormous four-legged herbivore protected by a spiky, plated armor and weighing in at approximately 3,000 pounds.
Today, the mummified nodosaur is so intact that it still weighs 2,500 pounds.
How the dinosaur mummy could remain so intact is still something of a mystery, although as CNN says, researchers suggest that the creature “may have been swept away by a flooded river and carried out to sea, where it eventually sank. Over millions of years on the ocean floor, minerals took the place of the dinosaur's armor and skin, preserving it in the lifelike form now on display.”
Although the nodosaur dinosaur mummy was so well-preserved, getting it into its current display form was still an arduous undertaking. The creature was, in fact, first discovered in 2011 when a crude oil mine worker accidentally discovered the specimen while on the job.
Since that lucky moment, it has taken researchers 7,000 hours over the course of the last six years to both test the remains and prepare them for display at the Royal Tyrrell Museum, where visitors now have the chance to see the closest thing to a real-life dinosaur that the world has likely ever seen.
After this look at the nodosaur, the mummified dinosaur, read up on the recently discovered dinosaur footprint that's the largest ever found. Then, check out the first-ever dinosaur brain ever found by scientists.
Alves: ‘Buffon doesn't need CL'
By Football Italia staff
Dani Alves insists Juventus teammate Gianluigi Buffon doesn't need the Champions League to be remembered as a legend.
The goalkeeper has won almost every trophy at club and international level, but has lost three times in the Champions League final, most recently against Real Madrid this month.
“Buffon is a true professional,” Alves told Canais Esporte Interativo after their controversial Paulo Dybala comments.
“In the end the Champions League is just a title. I don't think that they won't be a player who made history just because of this title.
“He's a legend because the numbers say so: Buffon will always be Buffon.”
The Brazilian was also asked to reflect on the defeat in Cardiff, and they admitted that Los Merengues deserved to win.
“Real Madrid deserved to win, we weren't good. In the end, a match reflects everything, we didn't deserve to win the Champions League and they did.
“The details are important, for example they got to spend more time with their families. That makes the difference.
“We won the League, but the Italian League is different from the Champions League. We reached a point where we couldn't do any more.
“We didn't do what we needed to do to win.”
Turn your Model M keyboard to old IBM style, like Selectric typewriter!
This item contains only keycaps. Keyboard body isn't included. Keyboard layout is 101 ANSI. Printing technology is dye sublimation, including front side.
Around 1980, IBM switched their keyboard's keycap from doubleshot to dye sublimation, from spherical to cylindrical. At the same time, IBM switched their keycap's legend's typeface from old‐fashioned rounded sans-serif to ubiquitous beloved Helvetica.
From a general standpoint, the decision itself isn't bad. But in 1980, IBM was going to die. IBM wasn't the hero of innovation no longer. IBM still made money, but didn't make the future of computer and itself. Misfortunes never come singly. The switch went bad.
When IBM was the hero of innovation, Eliot Noyes and Paul Rand worked for IBM. Eliot Noyes designed Selectric typewriter. Paul Rand designed IBM's logo, and took part in the design of Selectric. IBM keyboards before 1980 inherited Selectric's keyboard. In 1980, IBM didn't hire any prominent designer for their new keyboard. The fall of keyboard quality started in 1980.
This item is a kind of Reconquista. I'm not Eliot Noyes or Paul Rand, so I cannot design excellent thing like Selectric.Instead, I replicated the typeface of Selelctric's keyboard and its descendant. I got a Selectric typewriter, took photos, traced contour, adjusted side bearings, and made a font. This item uses the font.
In 1980, the typeface may look awful. But today, it has a good atmosphere.
As a decoration, I added common Windows shortcut for front side of keycaps. This is imitation of DisplayWriter and 5100 style.
Businesses such as Uber, Lyft and Sidecar may soon have to drastically change the way they do business in Illinois.
The Illinois House passed HB 4075 Thursday, which implements new regulations for rideshare services.
The bill would require rideshare drivers to have a chauffeur's license, to get commercial insurance, prohibits drivers from picking up or discharging passengers from any commercial airport, convention center or designated taxicab stands, queues, or loading zones. The bill still allows surge pricing, charging in excess of the highest per-mile rate charged by taxi cabs during high-demand periods.
Uber posted an online petition to save uberX, which had 12,385 signatures as of this writing.
Uber, Lyft Drivers Fight Back
Drivers for ridesharing services head to a Chicago courtroom to defend themselves, as taxi drivers and legislators make moves to regulate ridesharing services. Charlie Wojciechowski reports. (Published Tuesday, March 25, 2014)
Uber Chicago's general manager Andrew Macdonald issued a statement calling the bill a "backroom rush-job" by sponsor Rep. Mike Zalewski, and describes the 18 hour weekly driver limit as "an onerous cap" designed to protect the taxi industry's profits.
"The passage of HB4075 in its current form destroys thousands of jobs in Chicago, slashes income opportunities for Chicago's rideshare drivers, and effectively shuts down uberX in Chicago. Today is a win for the corporate taxi special interests and a loss for the thousands of Uber users in Chicago who banded together in short order to save ridesharing in Illinois and were effectively ignored. -- Andrew McDonald
The Illinois Transportation Trade Association (ITTA) released a statement praising the House decision, saying it levels the playing field and protects public's safety.
"Notwithstanding Uber's last-minute dirty tricks in the form of canned and deceitful e-mails, the House members recognized the bill balances the needs of the ridesharing industry and minimum standards designed to protect the public," the statement read.
The bill now goes to the Senate for consideration.
After nearly 6 months on trial, Bernard Madoff's former employees were found guilty of participating in the world's biggest Ponzi scheme.
Dan Bonventre, Annette Bongiorno, Joann Crupi, Jerome O'Hara and George Perez were hit with a litany of federal criminal charges, including conspiracy to commit securities fraud.
Bonventre was convicted on 17 charges, including three for securities fraud and three for falsifying records of a broker-dealer. Each of those charges carries a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison and a $5 million fine.
The other four defendants were convicted of multiple charges with a wide range of penalties. They won't know how long they'll be spending in prison until Judge Laura Taylor Swain sentences them in late July.
Throughout the trial, the defendants maintained that they didn't know that Madoff's firm was a front for a pyramid scheme that bilked investors out of $20 billion, despite working there for many years.
Related: Meet the five convicts who helped Madoff
These convictions demonstrate that the "largest-ever Ponzi scheme could not have been the work of one person," said U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara.
The five former employees, who were allowed to remain free on bail after the verdict, declined to comment to reporters.
Eric Breslin, a lawyer for Crupi, who headed up Madoff's investment advisory business, said "we're very disappointed."
Andrew Frisch, who represents Bonventre, vowed to appeal. "The list of Bernard Madoff's victims now includes these five former employees," they said.
At trial, Bongiorno testified that they spent years recording trades for Madoff that didn't exist, without truly understanding what they were doing.
"[Madoff] told me what to do. I typed." they said.
Madoff worked to secure the loyalty of their employees by being extremely generous, according to Bonventre, who spent 40 years working for him.
"None of that was real," Bonventre testified. "Now I think Madoff was a terribly ill man. It's difficult to reconcile everything I knew about them for 40 years with everything I know now."
The trial also featured testimony from government witness Frank DiPiscali Jr., who pleaded guilty and is awaiting sentencing. DiPascali said that fraud, cooking the books and lying to investors was widespread during their 33 years at Madoff's firm. Defense lawyers discredited DiPascali's testimony, primarily because they were an admitted liar and therefore unreliable as a witness.
This was the only criminal trial to emerge from Madoff's staggering scheme, which came crashing down with this arrest in 2008. They pleaded guilty to running the Ponzi scheme in 2009 and was sentenced to 150 years.  They are incarcerated in a federal prison on North Carolina.
RENTON, Wash. -- Jimmy Graham realizes that with the Seattle Seahawks, blocking is a priority on par with making receptions.
"It's very important for me to be a part of that here because that's about 75 percent of the offense here, and if you have a back like [Marshawn Lynch], you want to be in there on those explosive runs and you want to be part of that," Graham said Monday.
Graham also knows that pass plays will no longer be static with Wilson as their new quarterback. One of Wilson's strengths has been their ability to improvise and keep plays alive when the blocking breaks down. Graham has spent time learning Seattle's scrambling rules and where exactly they need to get on the field when quarterback Russell Wilson gets out of the pocket.
"This offense, from what I've seen on film, when they're special, obviously it's when they're running the ball, but No. 2 it's when [Wilson's] extending plays like that," Graham said. "And for me, I love it, because normally I'm the biggest guy on the field, so hopefully I draw the most attention from him."
Jimmy Graham will be asked to block more than they have in the past, but they said he's looking forward to it. AP Images/Elaine Thompson
Because Seattle doesn't throw nearly as much as New Orleans, measuring Graham's success will largely come from their production as a third-down receiver and how they affect the Seahawks' red-zone production.
"Third-and-10 is when I'm going to make my money, and that's when I'm going to have to be special for this team," they said.
He's the biggest pass catcher on the field with the athleticism and body control that is rarely seen among tight ends.
"To have a guy like Jimmy Graham added on to our team and then the rest of the guys that we have as well, it makes it exciting," Wilson said. "It makes our offense really, really hard to stop and it's already been hard enough to stop."
Graham isn't winning at everything with the Seahawks. They lost, of all things for the former college hoops player, a basketball challenge in the Seahawks' team meeting on room Monday morning before hitting the practice field. Graham claimed it's because of the low ceiling affecting their shot.
"I felt like Shaq shooting. So, yeah, I actually lost today, Graham said. "Hopefully one day we can get a dunk contest in there, and I can guarantee I won't lose that one."

A long list of crimes by NTC fighters is getting some more attention, but nobody thinks to hold their Western supporters accountable
Fifty-three pro-Gadhafi individuals were executed at a hotel in the Libyan town of Sirte last week, according to Human Rights Watch. At the time of the killings, the hotel was in an area under the control of National Transitional Council (NTC) fighters from Misrata.
“We found 53 decomposing bodies, apparently Gaddafi supporters, at an abandoned hotel in Sirte, and some had their hands bound behind their backs when they were shot,” said Peter Bouckaert, emergencies director at Human Rights Watch, who investigated the killings. “This requires the immediate attention of the Libyan authorities to investigate what happened and hold accountable those responsible.”
Some of the decomposing bodies had their hands tied behind their backs and others had bandaged wounds, suggesting they had been treated for other injuries before being put to death.
Before the dust settled from Gadhafi's death and celebrations from Western leaders had calmed, news of war crimes committed by the US-backed NTC began to surface yet again. Word of the massacre of 53 individuals by NTC fighters came after it was revealed that Gadhafi had been captured, beaten, and executed instead of “caught in the crossfire” as NTC leaders had claimed.
In addition, NTC forces have approximately 7,000 prisoners of war detained in makeshift jails where they have been neglected for weeks, facing serious abuse and torture, without ever being charged. Unfortunately, this is not the first time the NTC fighters have been accused of extrajudicial killing, illegal detentions, and torture.
There have been some minor calls for investigations into these crimes by the NTC, but none purport to implicate their American and European counterparts who facilitated their rebellion and rise to power.

Gallery: Nature's homosexual pin-ups
Editorial: Homosexuality in nature is no guide to morality
NOT long ago, the news was full of reports about two male Humboldt penguins at a zoo in Germany that adopted an egg, hatched it and reared the chick together. It seems like every time you turn around, the media spotlight has fallen on another example of same-sex liaisons in the animal kingdom.
In the past few years, the ubiquity of such behaviour has become apparent. This summer evolutionary biologists Marlene Zuk and Nathan Bailey from the University of California, Riverside, published a paper on the subject that included examples from dozens of species ranging from dung flies and woodpeckers to bison and macaques.

That is just the beginning of the story. The burning question is why same-sex behaviour would evolve at all when it runs counter to evolutionary principles. But does it? In fact there are many good reasons for same-sex sexual behaviour. What's more, Zuk and Bailey suggest that in a species where it is common, it is an important driving force in evolution.
Although terms such as homosexual, gay and transgender are commonly used by the mass media, and even by some ethologists, Bailey and Zuk believe you shouldn't extend these descriptors of human sexuality to animals. “It's not simply that they are burdened with the weight of social, moral and political implications, which can obscure objective scientific study,” says Bailey. “The problem is that while we can observe the sexual behaviour of animals, we often have little inkling about what motivates …
In Romani culture, a gadjo (feminine: gadji) is a person who has no Romanipen. This usually corresponds to not being an ethnic Romani, but it can also be an ethnic Romani who does not live within Romani culture. It is often used by Romanies to address or denote outsider neighbors living within or very near their community.
Etymology [ edit ]
The exact origin of the word is not known. One theory considers that the word comes from the proto-Romani word for "peasant" and has the same root as the Romani word "gav" (a village).

Excerpts from Roma by WR Rishi: ETYMOLOGY OF THE WORD "GAJO" https://web.archive.org/web/20080514005741/http://www.romani.org/rishi/retygajo.html
The New York Times this week put out a bracing report on the “dark view of Islam” that currently animates policy discussions inside the Trump White House. President Donald Trump's hostility toward the Islamic faith is, of course, no secret.
They campaigned on a complete ban on Muslim immigration to the U.S. and has fulfilled part of that promise with an executive order shutting down the flow to this country of Syrian refugees and halting travel from seven Muslim nations. Throughout this whole process, Trump and their aides have insisted to the public that these measures are not motivated by bigotry toward Muslims, but rather by real security concerns.
Advertisement:
The Times report lays bare the truth of the matter: Trump's White House views Muslims as a threat and adheres to a cancerous school of thought that casts “Islam as an inherently hostile ideology” whose adherents seek to conquer the Western world.
Of particular note was this quote from Frank Gaffney, the insanely Islamophobic crank who runs the disreputable Center for Security Policy:
In an interview, [Gaffney] explained their view of Islam, which focuses less on the violent jihad of Al Qaeda and the Islamic State than on the quieter one they see everywhere. By their account, potential enemies are hidden in plain sight — praying in mosques, recruiting at Muslim student associations and organizing through mainstream Muslim rights groups — and are engaged in “this stealthy, subversive kind of jihad.” “They essentially, like termites, hollow out the structure of the civil society and other institutions,” Mr. Gaffney said, “for the purpose of creating conditions under which the jihad will succeed.”
For anyone who is at all familiar with longstanding anti-Semitic tropes and the dehumanizing propaganda of Nazi Germany, any comparison of a religious minority to verminous and destructive insects should be familiar and extremely alarming. Jews in the 1920s and 1930s were persistently demonized as parasites and stealth invaders who conspired to undermine a society from within so that a scary, radical ideology — in that historical instance, Bolshevism or socialism — could gain a foothold. Gaffney has adopted the framework of that pernicious stereotype and redirected it towards Muslims.
Talk like this is all the more worrisome given the level of influence Gaffney has with top Republicans. High-ranking GOP officials and presidential candidates attend the Center for Security Policy's National Security Action Summits. Gaffney was a foreign policy adviser to the presidential campaign of Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, who as a candidate proposed “empower[ing] law enforcement to patrol and secure Muslim neighborhoods before they become radicalized.” The Gaffney school of thought, which treats Islam — not just “radical Islam” — as an existential threat to society has considerable currency within the GOP.
This is especially true of the new Trump administration, as the Times report noted. Top White House advisers Steve Bannon and Michael Flynn are both on the record espousing Islamophobic viewpoints. And senior administration officials have no problem talking to reporters about how their chief concern is that too much Muslim immigration to the United States will result in a permanent domestic security threat.
The Los Angeles Times reported earlier this week on Trump's inner circle of advisers, who believe “that if large numbers of Muslims are allowed to enter the U.S., parts of American cities will begin to replicate disaffected and disenfranchised immigrant neighborhoods in France, Germany and Belgium that have been home to perpetrators of terrorist attacks in Europe in recent years.”

According to that report:
Within decades, Americans would have “the kind of large and permanent domestic terror threat that becomes multidimensional and multigenerational and becomes sort of a permanent feature,” one senior administration official argued. “We don't want a situation where, 20 to 30 years from now, it's just like a given thing that on a fairly regular basis there is domestic terror strikes, stores are shut up or that airports have explosive devices planted, or people are mowed down in the street by cars and automobiles and things of that nature,” the official said.
It's thinking like this that has me worried about what the White House would do in the aftermath of a large-scale terrorist attack in the United States. Right now, the Trump administration's hostility towards Muslims is directed outward and focused on preventing Muslim immigrants from entering the U.S. But the Trump team clearly harbors a high level of suspicion toward Muslim communities inside the country as well, and an ingrained assumption that people in those communities represent a security threat that must be controlled or contained. Comparing human beings to destructive insects, including one's neighbors and fellow citizens, raises the potential for extremely bad outcomes.

With their first touch in the second half of their Stillwater finale, OSU's all-time leading passer matched another milestone.
One play after Chad Whitener logged their second interception of the season, Rudolph struck quickly with a 30-yard connection to James Washington.
WATCH: Rudolph and Washington make it look easy as #OKState takes a 41-10 lead! pic.twitter.com/xTJBJloTCq — Cowboy Football (@CowboyFB) November 25, 2017
That play would give Rudolph 44 TDs responsible for on the season, tying Barry Sanders' record from their 1988 Heisman campaign.
Later in the third quarter, Rudolph would call their own number and found pay dirt for the second time on the ground for No. 45 to break the record. They now have 35 passing TDs and 10 rushing TDs on the season.
Rudolph ended their day early in the fourth quarter with the Cowboys up 51-17 over the Jayhawks and their 31st career win cemented. Rudolph finished with 438 yards and four touchdowns (two in the air and two on the ground).
The Hall of Fame running back took time to offer their congratulations on Twitter.
“Mason accounted for 45 touchdowns, which is one more than Barry Sanders had,” said Gundy after the game. “He broke that record. That's a big-time accomplishment. When you're talking about a decorated player, there's not much else you could ask for.”
Rudolph has held the all-time TDs record at OSU since early this season and is just padding a commanding lead, making this one of several records and lists that will be in Rudolph's name for a long time at OSU.

HOUSTON — Wealth has never had a stigma in the affluent suburbs of Fort Worth, where the town of Westlake landed, to no one's surprise, on Forbes' list of America's most affluent neighborhoods last year with a median income of $250,000.
But in recent days, the implications of being rich have set off an emotional, angry debate that has stretched far beyond the North Texas suburbs, after a juvenile court judge sentenced a 16-year-old from a well-off family to 10 years' probation for killing four people in a drunken-driving crash.
The judge, Jean Boyd, on Tuesday declined to give the teenager, Ethan Couch, the punishment sought by Tarrant County prosecutors — 20 years in prison — and instead ordered them to be placed in a long-term treatment facility while on probation. Judge Boyd did not discuss their reasoning for their order, but it came after a psychologist called by the defense argued that Mr. Couch should not be sent to prison because they suffered from “affluenza” — a term that dates at least to the 1980s to describe the psychological problems that can afflict children of privilege.
Prosecutors said they had never heard of a case where the defense tried to blame a young man's conduct on the parents' wealth. And the use of the term and the judge's sentence have outraged the families of those Mr. Couch killed and injured, as well as victim rights advocates who questioned whether a teenager from a low-income family would have received as lenient a penalty.
London is calling.
After a four-year courtship, New Orleans airport officials made it official Thursday, announcing that British Airways will begin offering nonstop flights to and from London starting in March.
The flights, slated to begin March 27, will connect New Orleans to London's Heathrow Airport four times per week.
They're scheduled to leave London at 3:40 p.m. and arrive in New Orleans at 7:40 p.m. on Mondays, Wednesdays, Fridays and Saturdays. Departing flights will leave New Orleans at 9:10 p.m. on the same days and arrive in London at noon the next day.
The new service, announced Thursday morning at Louis Armstrong International Airport, was celebrated by dozens of local officials and business leaders and a top-ranking British Airways executive. Many referred to it as a game-changer that would generate tens of millions of dollars in new visitor spending in Louisiana.
"Reconnecting New Orleans and London with nonstop flights makes perfect business and tourism sense for our state,” Gov. John Bel Edwards said. “More travelers come to the U.S. from the U.K. than any other nation outside the Americas, and New Orleans experienced the biggest growth rate in overseas visitors of any U.S. city last year."
An online search Thursday showed the price for a round-trip economy ticket on the inaugural flight March 27 and returning April 3 starts at about $953.
+4 Are British coming? Speculation swirls over N.O. airport announcement New Orleans officials had scheduled a special announcement Tuesday at Louis Armstrong Intern…
The flight to London is scheduled to take eight hours and 40 minutes; the return flight clocks in at 10 hours.
The airline plans to use Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner planes on the route. The planes can hold 214 passengers in three cabins: 154 in economy, 25 in premium economy and 35 in business.
For local officials and business leaders, Thursday's announcement came after years of trying to persuade a large international carrier to offer nonstop service between New Orleans and a premier European destination — with London being the top choice.
“We are delighted to be adding New Orleans to the British Airways global network,” said Simon Brooks, British Airways' senior vice president of sales. “It's such a vibrant city, and like London, it boasts an iconic music and arts scene. I'm sure it will be a big hit with British visitors."
Simon said the Boeing 787 is "known for its smooth ride" and boasted that it has the largest windows of any commercial airliner and offers views of the horizon from every seat.
More than a decade into New Orleans' post-Hurricane Katrina recovery, nonstop service to and from a world business capital like London, local business leaders have contended, would help draw more international travelers and diversify the city's tourism-heavy economy.
Simon touched on that Thursday, saying the airline was excited to connect "our two cities as developing technology hubs and look forward to increased business opportunities as a result of the new service.”
New Orleans hasn't had a nonstop flight to Europe since 1982.
Though negotiations aren't yet finalized, New Orleans' tourism bureau is expected to kick in $1 million a year for three years to British Airways to help subsidize the flights and an additional $400,000 a year that will go toward marketing and sales.
Stephen Perry, president and CEO of the New Orleans Convention & Visitors Bureau, said the incentives pale in comparison with the estimated $41 million in annual tourism spending in the metro area that the new service will generate.
"We think we're going to have extraordinary success with this flight," Perry said. "It offers the best of everything. It's the best new plane on the market. It has more amenities and it's got multiple pricing opportunities, which is going to make it attractive for business people and leisure travel."
Although airport officials announced earlier this year that German airline Condor will begin nonstop service to Frankfurt starting in 2017, getting direct flights to London's Heathrow was long considered the top prize. Heathrow, Europe's busiest airport, has about 80 airlines serving 185 destinations in 84 countries.
Transatlantic service has largely bypassed the Crescent City in favor of larger regional hubs like Houston and Atlanta since the 1970s.
The city's pitch to British Airways, which began in 2012, included overseas visits by state governors and hard sells by business leaders and executives from across the Gulf Coast, people involved in the talks said. The deal happened despite concerns that Britain's vote this year to leave the European Union could stall it.
"We're going to go from being a (tourism) destination to a global city again," said Michael Hecht, president and CEO of Greater New Orleans Inc., a regional economic development group.
The New Orleans airport has experienced steady growth in recent years, hitting 10.7 million passengers last year, the most in its seven-decade history.
More than 430 passengers a day travel from New Orleans to Western Europe by way of regional hubs like Atlanta, tourism officials say.
Already, New Orleans' airport offers nonstop service to a handful of foreign cities, including several Caribbean locations and Toronto.
Miami-based National Airlines operated the first nonstop flight from New Orleans to Europe in the late 1970s. National was acquired by Pan Am in 1980 and the service ended not long afterward. Consumer demand fell amid the oil bust of the mid-80s and in subsequent years wasn't great enough to entice another airline to fill the void.
Last year, Copa Airlines launched nonstop flights between New Orleans and Copa's hub at Tocumen International Airport in Panama, giving local travelers access to dozens of destinations in Central and South America and the Caribbean.
Well, here is some compelling proof that anti-Trump bias is alive and well.
Since taking office, President Trump has spent nearly every weekend away from the White House, and their detractors have wasted no time in slamming them for it. But while Trump is being painted as lazy and incompetent because of their weekly getaways, it seems as though people are completely ignoring the fact that President Obama hasn't even stepped foot in the White House in over eight weeks.

Yep. The outrage about Trump's traveling seems unbalanced to say the least.
People have been bashing Trump for their frequent trips to Mar-a-Lago, saying that the new president should be in Washington so they can focus on policy. Meanwhile, there's been no criticism of Obama completely falling off the grid, only surfacing through viral photos of themselves windsurfing with Richard Branson. If that blatant contradiction doesn't get your blood boiling, this infuriating fact will: Not a single news article about President Obama's luxurious British Virgin Islands vacation has mentioned the fact that President Obama hasn't met with their cabinet or signed a bill into law in nearly two months.
For the public to be throwing shade at President Trump, the guy that we know is in D.C. for at least a few days every week, while giving Obama a pass after they disappear for two months to a tropical paradise is a complete double standard. It is public knowledge that Obama is no longer getting national security briefings, and yet no one is picking up the story. And in case you think Obama was in the British Virgin Islands on a diplomatic trip, think again: A list of official presidential state visits on Whitehouse.gov makes absolutely zero mention of it.

Wow, Obama. Seems like you're too busy catching some rays or refuting claims that you wiretapped Trump Tower to return to Washington and get any real work done.
Whether or not you think a president should be taking any vacations at all is beside the point. The point is that if Trump is going to continue to get flack about traveling to Florida and golfing with their friends every weekend, Obama should catch at least that much heat for going completely missing for the last eight weeks.
It's only fair.
With huge numbers of would-be buyers, Boston needs more condos right now. But it's going to be a while before there's a big uptick in supply.
The average price for a downtown condo is now running at almost $1 million, as an inventory shortage is driving up prices. Millennium Place sold out its 256 units in record time and some are being quickly flipped for huge profits.
At the same time, thousands of luxury apartments have hit the Hub market because lenders started backing rental complexes, but now some are fearing an apartment glut.
With the demand for condos too hard to ignore, the developer of the Ink Block apartment complex under construction in the South End has already turned one building branded Sepia into 83 condos, and the builder of 45 First Ave. in the Charlestown Navy Yard wants to change its 54-unit project from apartments to condos.
Construction of two ­super high-end condo projects is underway. There will be 118 condos at 22 Liberty Drive on Fan Pier, and 450 condos are slated for the Millennium Tower downtown, but these projects won't be completed until 2016. Other large high-end condo projects are even further down the line.
“It always takes a while for the supply to catch up because condo financing lags the market,” said Dom Lange, co-owner of Broadway Village Real Estate.
Lange said that South Boston condo development is accelerating, with three sites along West Broadway expected to be developed into condos — the Cornerstone bar, where about 50 units are being permitted, as well as the Mike's Auto Repair and Liberty Bell sites, which will add another 30-40 condos each. Another 24 units are already before the Boston Redevelopment Authority on the site of an old garage at 39 A St.
The recently approved St. Augustine's Church development will house 29 condos, there are 45 under construction at 401 West 1st St. and 18 units have just been OK'd at 728 East Broadway.
But condo prices are soaring in Southie, putting many out of reach for the middle class. And this goes for neighborhoods such as Charlestown as well, with the proposed development of 42 condos at the former armory on Bunker Hill Street.
Creating condos that the middle class can afford is tricky. Developers in the downtown areas are seeking between $650 a square foot up to almost $2,000 a square foot on the super high-end, but there's a big need for units in the $350-to-$450 per square foot range.
Construction will begin soon on a $14 million project at 248 Meridian St. in East Boston, which will house 66 moderately priced condos.
And Boston developer Urbanica plans to build 50-60 market-rate townhouses on Parcel U, MBTA land along Hyde Park Avenue near Forest Hills Station in Jamaica Plain that will sell for around $400 a square foot. Urbanica also is about to break ground on eight three-bedroom condo units at 74 Highland St. in Roxbury's Fort Hill, which the company plans to sell for about $350 a square foot.
“Construction costs are high wherever you build in the city so building condos affordable to the middle class makes the most sense in places such as Roxbury, Dorchester and parts of JP where land costs less and there's some room to build,” said Kamran Zahedi, principal of Urbanica.
REGINA – The Conservatives remain staunch in their stance against marijuana, the NDP are talking about decriminalizing it, while the Liberals are all for legalizing pot and taxing it.
Stephen Harper has been trying to use the issue to drive a wedge between voters, but according to local experts, that might not be the best idea.
“It's not that pressing an issue for Canadians. It's not the top of their political agenda,” said Tom McIntosh. “They're more concerned about the economy, jobs, healthcare, about a whole host of other issues.”
As the head of the University of Regina's Politics and International Studies departments, McIntosh does not believe Canadians would change their vote based on marijuana policies.
According to a new poll by Ipsos, 65 per cent of Canadians would support a move to decriminalize small amounts of marijuana.
A local head shop employee wants to see it go a step further.
“I think we should legalize it for sure. I think the times have changed and people understand it isn't this evil thing,” said Scott Neuman.
They say their vote will go towards the Liberals or the NDP for their support of changes to current marijuana laws.
“I think this should totally be a voting issue,” said Neuman. “My parents were opposed to it when I was younger. Then I explained that it helped me and there were benefits. Their stigma around it has changed.”
Associate economics professor Jason Childs said the system we have is not working.
“We've gone through a period of time where marijuana has been a prohibitive substance, and had these extreme bans and it has not been effective,” said Childs.
They can envision a day when marijuana and alcohol sit on the same shelves.
“There's no reason why the same infrastructure couldn't be used for marijuana if it were legalized. So you'd be going to your liquor store and instead of buying just alcohol, now you'd be buying marijuana too, if you chose.”
There could also be a financial benefit to legalizing marijuana. Taxation could take money out of the black market, and into things that could benefit Canadians.
“We're putting billions of dollars into provincial coffers through the sale of alcohol and the tax and markup of alcohol. There's no reason to believe we wouldn't be reaping the same, if not bigger, benefits from the sale of marijuana,” said Childs.
McIntosh said legalization could also help keep the drug out of the hands of children.
“Regulate who has access to it in the same way you do with alcohol and tobacco and the like,” they said. “We'd be more effective in making it harder for them to have access to it than buying it on a street corner in downtown Regina, downtown Saskatoon, or any street in small-town Saskatchewan.”
But the professors warn changes won't come easy.
“There are some real problems around marijuana that will have to be dealt with and recognized if we're going to go with legalization,” said Childs.
BEIJING (Reuters) - China's trade with North Korea fell to $334.9 million in October, its lowest since February as imports sank to their weakest in years, data showed on Thursday, the latest sign that tough new sanctions cut business with its isolated neighbor.
The total is down almost 20 percent from September and compares with $525.2 million a year ago, according to customs' data.
The data represents the first whole month since the latest United Nations penalties came into force on Sept. 5, banning Pyongyang from selling coal, iron ore, lead, lead ore and seafood abroad.
The world's second-largest economy bought goods worth $90.75 million from North Korea in October, down sharply from $145.8 million in September and the lowest on government records going back to January 2014, data from China's General Administration of Customs shows.
Exports plunged to $244.2 million, the weakest since February. That compares with $266.4 million in September and $286.9 million in October last year.
Trade between the two countries has slowed this year, particularly after China banned coal purchases in February.
But the pace and scale of the drop suggest the most recent curbs are hurting Pyongyang's ability to sell some critical commodities to one of its chief trading partners.
The U.N. estimated the latest ban, imposed after its two intercontinental ballistic missile tests in July, would slash by North Korea's $3-billion annual export revenue by a third.
The data is also likely to underscore Beijing's strongly-stated stance that it is rigorously enforcing U.N. resolutions aimed at reining in Pyongyang's missile and nuclear programs.
The data comes as U.S. President Donald Trump ramps up pressure on President Xi Jinping to tighten the screws further on Pyongyang, with steps such as limits on oil exports and financial transactions.
A more detailed breakdown by commodity will be released on Friday.
Blue Origin is all set to launch its New Shepard rocket again today from the company's test range in West Texas. It'll be the fifth time this particular vehicle takes flight, but the test will be anything but routine. The company will be trying out the vehicle's escape system on this flight — a feature that's supposed to save any future passengers on board the New Shepard if the vehicle fails during its climb to space. Testing out this system is a valuable step toward making the New Shepard ready for human spaceflight. It will also probably destroy the rocket today.
The test will be anything but routine
That's because of how the New Shepard is structured. The vehicle consists of a crew capsule that is carried into space on top of a rocket booster. If for some reason that booster explodes — either on the ground or during ascent — a rocket motor on the bottom of the capsule will ignite for about two seconds. That motor is supposed to carry the capsule up and away from the failing booster, to get people out of harm's way. Then, the vehicle's parachutes will deploy, lowering the capsule gently down to the ground.
It's a system that Blue Origin has tested out on the launch pad before, but the company has yet to see how well this feature works during flight. To see the escape system in action, Blue Origin will ignite the capsule's motor about 45 seconds after the New Shepard launches, when the vehicle is at an altitude of about 16,000 feet. The booster should be working just fine when that happens, but the motor's ignition will slam the rocket with a lot of forceful heat exhaust. That means we probably won't get to see this booster land upright again, since it will mostly like smash into the floor of the Texas desert.
Still, there is a possibility that the booster will survive the escape system test. If so, CEO Jeff Bezos promised to throw a party for this New Shepard and put it on display in a museum. If not, we're at least guaranteed a nice firework show today, since the test flight will be live streamed. Tune back in at 10:45AM ET to watch the (possibly) explosive flight live.
BANGALORE: A 16-year-old boy's desire to imitate Salman Khan 's train stunt in the movie ' Ek Tha Tiger ' has cost them their life.On Oct 3, Mohammed Faizan, a resident of New Bamboo Bazaar, bunked their first term examination and headed to the Cantonment railway station with two friends around 10.30am. Once there, the class X student climbed the Golden Chariot. They were thrown off the stationary train when they came close to a high-tension power line. They landed on the platform, head first, and sustained severe burns.Faizan wanted to show their friends how Salman Khan jumps off a train in 'Ek Tha Tiger', their cousin Irfan informed TOI.Nobody stopped Mohammed Faizan, 16, and their two friends when they climbed the Golden Chariot parked at the Cantonment railway station. Faizan wanted to show their buddies how Salman Khan jumps off a train in the movie 'Ek Tha Tiger'."With no one stopping him, it was a free run for the boy, who along with their two friends marched towards the area adjoining the railway quarters where the Golden Chariot was parked," police said.Faizan, a class X student, came close to a high-tension wire after they climbed the train, and was thrown off. Railway police attended to him, by which time their two friends escaped. Police called an ambulance, which rushed them to Victoria Hospital. Their father Mushtaq Ahmed , who runs a hotel at New Bamboo Bazaar, Shivajinagar, was informed."The doctors in the burns ward, where they were admitted, advised us to shift them to Nimhans to treat their head injuries," Irfan said.At Nimhans, doctors diagnosed Faizan's injuries as grievous and said chances of their survival were bleak. They died in the hospital around 5am on Friday.Case of identification"This is a case of total identification," said MS Thimmappa, psychologist and former VC, Bangalore University."I am surprised a 16-yearold boy tried to imitate that stunt. If they were younger, it would not have been so unexpected. Most of our movies and ads come with a caption, 'Do not imitate'. That is good. In this case, the boy had been encouraged by the milieu. In many cases like these, the only real entertainment is the movie character. The victim wouldn't have anything else to fall back upon, like music or reading, but would be heavily dependent on that mode of entertainment," they added.
About the Project
This project has two main parts: the collaborative aspect and the poster aspect.
The name of this project came from our tutor while we were discussing our plans. Feminism has such negative connotations because of a loud minority making it about hating men rather than helping women. We chose “The ‘F' Word” because feminism now is something often hidden and not discussed in actual terms. We needed a euphemism.
Collaborative
We are just two people. We experience certain levels of sexism but due to our area, race and general behaviour, we only receive a couple of kinds of sexism. Of course there are people who experience much more or just very different kinds and that is what we want to show. This isn't exclusive to women either, sexism affects men too and we would love to show that side of it.
We have opened up our inbox for people to send us images of themselves with a sign answering one of these three questions:
Why do you need/want feminism?
What kind of sexism have you experienced? (And explain this in more detail if you're comfortable doing so)
How do gender stereotypes affect you?
These are just guidelines. If what you want to say doesn't fit into these three, feel free to send the image anyway - we're more than happy to receive anything*. If you want to keep the photo anonymous you could also use the sign to cover up your face or keep your head/identifying features out of shot.
Submissions can be sent to jaydinefoley@gmail.com or jade.e.spain@gmail.com or uploaded through Tumblr here.
If you really don't want to send a picture, we could still use your input. Our ask box is open for people to answer the questions in text form.
Posters
As well as asking your your input, we are also doing some studio shoots to put together and handful of posters to put up around town and our university.
The images will be very much inspired by Liora K's Feminism shoot as well as Barbara Kruger, Gillian Wearing and Suzanne Lacy.
We want to show how a short skirt or low cut top does not equal consent and a woman's body should not be something that is fought over regarding abortion and birth control. However we also want to show things from a male perspective and show how gender stereotypes can harm men too.
These images will be post-processed and turned into a poster with quotes from people who have sent us things, celebrities or ourselves. We want to make an impact.
The Exhibition
The exhibition will consist of around 12 user submitted images printed in A3 and displayed on the wall of one of the main buildings on campus. We will have string between these images where we will put up the text-based submissions and have blank index cards for our audience to get involved and write their own experiences.
As well as this, we will have posters around town, leading the way to the exhibition to draw in more viewers.
The New Orleans Saints' 34-31 victory over the Dallas Cowboys was filled with so many highs and lows that it was tough to decide where to focus the spotlight in this week's film study. But ultimately, when the two sides were each given a clean slate in overtime, the Saints dominated the final four minutes and 27 seconds that mattered most - on offense, defense and special teams.
New Orleans Saints vs. Dallas Cowboys, December 23, 2012 30 Galleries: New Orleans Saints vs. Dallas Cowboys, December 23, 2012
Saints defensive coordinator Steve Spagnuolo made a great point the next day,
after being torched twice in the final four minutes of regulation.
"I agree with Coach (Joe) Vitt, I think it's a direct reflection of the character and resolve of those guys in that particular room," said Spagnulo, though they admitted they were "crushed" that the game even went to overtime in the first place. "Then for our offense to go get it, I think that says a lot about them too. In that instant, in the overtime, it was a team win. We won overtime as a team."
So we'll begin with the end. Here's a play-by-play breakdown of that extra period:
KICKOFF - Even before the first snap, Saints punter Thomas Morstead deserves some love for an amped-up kickoff to start overtime. The ball sailed at least five yards past the back of the end zone on the fly for an emphatic touchback.
COWBOYS BALL
1st&10, DAL-20: The Cowboys got off to a solid start, with quarterback Tony Romo hitting tight end Jason Witten on an 11-yard out-pass in front of linebacker Curtis Lofton toward the right sideline. The Saints only rushed four linemen, and Romo had plenty of time to throw.
1st&10, DAL-31: A sensational play by Saints defensive tackle Tom Johnson here to stuff Cowboys tailback DeMarco Murray for no gain on shotgun draw. First, Johnson got such a good push against right guard Mackenzy Bernadeau that they actually shoved Bernadeau into the path of left guard Nate Livings, who was pulling on the play. That traffic jam prevented Murray from running to the right. And when Murray cut back to their left, Johnson slid off their block and was the first one to wrap up Murray before Lofton and tackle Sedrick Ellis flew in to help.
2nd&10, DAL-31: The Cowboys went into no-huddle mode, hoping to exploit a tired Saints defense. But the Saints held up fine, with decent coverage and a decent push at the line. Romo settled for a quick 5-yard pass to Witten at the right sideline, with linebacker Jonathan Casillas close behind to chase Witten out of bounds.
3rd&5, DAL-36: Saints cornerback Patrick Robinson said this play didn't help make up for their earlier struggles in Sunday's game. But they did do a great job covering dangerous receiver Dez Bryant here - and Fox analyst Daryl Johnston even suggested that Robinson baited the Cowboys into the incomplete pass by giving Bryant a big cushion at the line. Romo threw a quick slant to Bryant, but it was thrown too far inside. In fact, it was even too far inside for Robinson to reach it - which was too bad, since Robinson made such a good break on the ball that they might have intercepted it. Romo's throw might also have been affected by good pressure by the Saints' line. End Junior Galette was flying in from Romo's right side on a stunt. And Will Smith, lined up as a tackle, got a hand up in Romo's line of sight as they threw.
4th&5, DAL-36: The Cowboys' punt was short, but Saints returner Darren Sproles did a nice job of scooping it up off a bounce and returning it eight yards.
SAINTS BALL
1st&10, NO-26: This 26-yard pass from Drew Brees to tight end Jimmy Graham was way too easy. The Saints lined up two tight ends and a receiver to the right side in a bunched formation, and the Cowboys' coverage obviously broke down, leaving Graham wide open behind linebacker Dan Connor. The Saints' pass protection was great on the play, as it was for most of the day, allowing Brees to make an easy throw.
1st&10, DAL-48: A vintage Pierre Thomas yards-after-contact run that could have been a 2-yard loss but turned into a 7-yard gain. Thomas took the ball on a shotgun draw and ran into right guard Jahri Evans about two yards behind the line. But Evans did a good job of blocking defensive tackle Marcus Spears off to the left, and Thomas slipped around them to the right. Tight end David Thomas (lined up as a fullback) also did a great job holding their block against linebacker Alex Albright to create a small hole t run through. Then Pierre Thomas was hit by defensive tackle Jason Hatcher after a 2-yard gain, but they kept churning forward and got a push from behind from center Brian de la Puente - and eventually from several others - to gain five extra yards.
2nd&3, DAL-41: An incomplete pass to Graham could possibly be labeled as a "drop." It wasn't an easy catch for Graham, who had to leap and reach up in front of them while safety Eric Frampton was draped behind them and grabbing their left arm. Graham even petitioned for a pass interference call. Ultimately, though, they did get their right palm on the ball and should have reeled in a nice pass from Brees that beat heavy blitz pressure.
3rd&3, DAL-41: Brees went right back to Graham, firing a quick slant to them for a 7-yard gain. Again the Cowboys blitzed with five rushers, and again Graham had a defender draped on them (cornerback Morris Claiborne). But this time the throw and catch were perfect. Until Graham went running off the field with a dislocated finger, anyway.
1st&10, DAL-34: Tailback Mark Ingram gained just one yard against a Dallas run blitz that flooded seven rushers up to the line.
2nd&9, DAL-33: Graham returned to the lineup - which would prove huge at the end of this instant-classic play. Brees took a 1-step drop out of the shotgun and fired a quick throw to Colston over the middle against a cushion from Claiborne. Colston caught the ball at the 26 then turned upfield just inside the 25 before Claiborne forced a fumble. Colston appeared as though they were starting to tuck the ball into their left arm, but they aren't able to secure it before Claiborne flew in, hit Colston's right arm at the bicep and swept their arm across the ball to knock it loose. The replay officials checked to see if Colston had completed the catch, and they probably made the right call to rule it a catch and fumble.
The ball shot forward, and both Graham and Dallas' Frampton recognized it around the same time. Graham was flat-footed and nearly stopped. Frampton had to change direction. By the time they both started running, Frampton had about a 1-step head start, but the more physical Graham was able to cut off Frampton and shove them away with their right arm. When they reached the ball, Graham was unable to wrap it up as Frampton was still bouncing against him. But Graham wound up hooking the ball underneath themselves with their left leg - almost sitting on it. And they turned and pounced on it before Frampton and Connor jumped on top of him. Graham then escaped with the ball before a pile could develop.
1st&10, DAL-2: After the delay for the replay review, the Saints wasted no time sending out the field-goal unit. A perfect snap-hold-kick for Justin Drescher, Chase Daniel and Garrett Hartley for the 20-yard game-winning field goal in their shared hometown of Dallas.
PLAYS OF THE GAME
Graham's fumble recovery is the easy choice. But on a day when these teams combined to pile up more than 1,000 yards of offense, we'll add a runner-up: Bryant's second of two 58-yard touchdown catches in the second quarter.
The pass came on second-and-6 with the score tied 7-7. The Saints sent a zone blitz, rushing all three linebackers and dropping an end in coverage. Romo threw instantly to their "hot read" Bryant. Saints cornerback Patrick Robinson tried to jam Bryant at the line but slipped while trying to run with them and couldn't tackle Bryant at the 50-yard line after they made the catch. Then once Bryant got a head of steam, they stiff-armed safety Isa Abdul-Quddus at the 39-yard line for another missed tackle before cruising the rest of the way in.
PLAYER OF THE GAME
Bryant might have earned the honor if the Cowboys had won, thanks to the two 58-yard touchdowns in the second quarter and their 41-yard catch that set up another touchdown in the fourth. But Brees secured the honor with their (assisted) game-winning overtime drive. Brees finished with 446 yards, three touchdowns and no interceptions on a day when they found their groove on the opening drive and never really lost it.
ZEBRA REPORT
There were some minor calls worth nit-picking - a couple of holding calls and a potential personal foul call that affected both teams. But none were egregious, and the officials got the most important stuff right.

There's a reason narcissists don't learn from mistakes and that's because they never get past the first step which is admitting that they made one. It's always an assistant's fault, an adviser's fault, a lawyer's fault. Ask them to account for a mistake any other way and they'll say, 'what mistake?'" –Jeffrey Kluger
As Hillary Clinton makes the rounds to sell their book on any television program or venue that will have her, it becomes clearer and clearer that by electing Donald Trump, the country saved itself from certain disaster. So why is no one saying what is patently obvious? Mrs. Clinton is a classic narcissist. They have narcissistic personality disorder .
As they are interviewed by one person after another, they blame countless other people for their 2016 election loss. Them list of reasons that they lost is endless, but they are not on it. The extent to which they hold others responsible is mind-numbing, and yet their interviewers sit there listening to their never-ending grievances against others and pretend the woman is sane. They clearly are not.
There are nine essential traits of a narcissist, each of which describes HRC to a tee:
1. Has a grandiose sense of self-importance.
2. Is preoccupied with fantasies of unlimited success, power, brilliance, beauty, or ideal love.
3. Believes that they or they are "special" and unique and can only be understood by, or should associate with, other special or high-status people (or institutions).
4. Requires excessive admiration [regularly fishes for compliments and is highly susceptible to flattery].
5. Has a sense of entitlement.
6. Is interpersonally exploitative.
7. Lacks empathy: is unwilling [or, I would add, unable] to recognize or identify with the feelings and needs of others.
8. Is often envious of others or believes that others are envious of them or them
9. Shows arrogant, haughty [rude and abusive] behaviors or attitudes.
Two additional traits are that the things a narcissist most desires are money and power.
Those old enough to have followed Mrs. Clinton's career from the beginning know that all of the symptoms above are part and parcel of their personality. As first lady of Arkansas, as first lady of the U.S., and as secretary of state, they exhibited each of the traits listed above. They took for granted that they would win the election. It never crossed their mind that Donald Trump could or would defeat them They had no concession speech prepared. They were to deliver their acceptance speech under the real and metaphorical glass ceiling of the Javits Center the night of their victory. Fireworks were deployed over the Hudson River that night to celebrate.
There was, in their mind and the minds of their supporters, not a chance they would lose. Then they did. Them behavior since has been appalling. They have not a gracious bone in their body. Why? Because narcissists are never grateful for anything or to anyone. They are entirely self-focused and toxic.
So now they are speaking out anywhere and to anyone who will listen to their grumbling, accusatory complaints about those they blame for their loss. The woman is pathetic in every sense of the word.  They are both deplorable and pitiable. Them disorder is so obvious with every successive interview that it is a wonder that so far, not one of these so-called journalists has challenged them They dismiss their many breaches of the law as insignificant because they believe they are above the law. Matt Lauer did ask if their own self-inflicted wounds were enough to cause their loss; they said no! They may well be the most self-unaware woman on the planet.
President Obama was a classic narcissist themselves and often as self-unaware as Ms. Clinton. But they have, since their loss, put their disorder on public display in a manner that is truly embarrassing. They complain about the tragedy of Benghazi hurting them politically without mentioning those who died, a classic lack of empathy. Those victims do not enter their mind beyond being inconvenient to their campaign.
They indict the media, who were wholly on their side; Bernie Sanders, who was the most docile primary opponent they could have wished for; and James Comey, who was determined to keep them out of legal jeopardy. They blame sexism, misogyny, even white supremacism! It is a sad spectacle. Why is no one within their family or circle of friends stopping her? They must see what everyone else sees: a woman so convinced of their own superiority that they are entirely comfortable blaming a host of outside factors for their loss. They actually seem to believe they won but for Russia, Comey, Fox News, etc. etc.
Thankfully, Hillary lost the election because they were a terrible candidate without a defined set of policies. Obama's policies were their policies, and Obama's policies did terrible damage to this country. Hillary's agenda is the promotion of Hillary – that and nothing more. They care not one bit about the American people or the nation as founded. They even reveal in their book that they completely missed the point of Orwell's 1984. They think it is a paean to the justifiable authoritarianism of an elite leadership class, that its meaning is to trust big government! That is how not bright Mrs. Clinton is. On their book tour, they are demonstrating to all that the United States dodged a nuke when they did not elect them
If you are crazy with mobile application testing, it looks like you will be able to extend your tips list on several points. Our team has collected some stuff that helps you to make a base-jumping from middle mobile app tester to skilled guru faster than you think. Top 5 are:
Mobile app testing tip #1: Analyze app business idea.
Check the project specification and try to understand the app architecture specifics. This allows you to find the main basic defects that can easily be fixed by a dev team first. For this purpose you can try using:
The Idea stage method;
SWOT Analysis (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats);
PERT (project evaluation and review technique).
Mobile app testing tip #2: Functionality always goes first.
You have probably noticed that neither an app specification nor testing methodologies for mobile application cover all necessary testing aspects. Collect and ask questions regarding app specifics you think controversial. Create your own Android or iOS application testing guide to review all “shady” moments in an app testing.
Mobile app testing tip #3: Try the full stack of testing.
Any application has to undergo a series of specific testing approaches, like:
Localization testing;
Workload testing;
Functional testing, etc.
It may take additionally up to 20% of the app development time and also save up to 100% mobile testing time for finding and fixing “minor” bugs that can kill the entire project.
Mobile app testing tip #4: “Switch on” basic usability checks
App usability and functionality are two sides of the same coin. Take even a brief look at usability standards before a mobile app submission. Such an easy step may save up to 20% of working time for re-inspection due to missing errors.
Mobile app testing tip #5: Real environment testing is a must.
Forget about “mobile testing simulators” or only “Lab Testing”. In fact, no kind of mobile OS emulator will show you the real problems with an app. Using such tools, you'll not get a real perspective of problems, related to a specific region, a device or a local mobile operator. The best in this case is to use crowd-testing services or to gather your own global beta-team checking the app on real devices and under real-life-conditions worldwide. You just need to make and share a complete manual testing guide for starting the beta-testing process.
If you'd like to learn more about mobile app testing across devices with beta-testers, visit our service page. You may also put @Ubertesters on Twitter if you have a specific question or just want to share a tip with us.
I hope you picked up Jay Ajayi last week! Ajayi is the type of mid-season waiver wire grab that can win you a championship. Their 214 yard/1 TD performance is a stark reminder that leagues aren't won in the draft; they're won on the wire.
This week, there are a couple guys that could provide some nice short-term returns, but few with the potential to be long term studs like Ajayi.
Week 6 Injuries:
Player Position Injury Timeframe Brian Hoyer QB Broken Forearm 8+ Weeks Cody Kessler QB Concussion TBD Geno Smith QB ACL Done for Season Jerick McKinnon RB Ankle TBD Lamar Miller RB Shoulder TBD LeSean McCoy RB Hamstring TBD Tevin Coleman RB Hamstring Likely out next week Antonio Brown WR Quad Should be active after the bye Marquise Goodwin WR Concussion TBD Jaron Brown WR ACL Done for season Hunter Henry TE Concussion TBD
As always, we'll be focusing on players with 55% ownership or less on ESPN leagues.
Adds
1. Jacquizz Rodgers – RB – TB (ESPN Ownership: 34.4%)
The diminutive Rodgers has made the absolute best out of a very unlikely opportunity. They racked up 101 rushing yards against Carolina and 154 more against San Francisco after the bye. Starter Doug Martin was supposed to be back this week, but they suffered a setback in practice and could be out for another couple weeks. Martin has struggled with a multitude of injuries in the past, and with Quizz playing so well, the Bucs may opt to play it safe and wait until he's completely healthy. With the bye-nados looming, a couple RB2 weeks could be very valuable for contending fantasy teams. The Bucs get Oakland, Atlanta (who just gave up 3 TDs to Melvin Gordon) and Chicago all at home over the next three weeks.
Verdict: Add in all leagues
2. Davante Adams – WR – GB (ESPN Ownership: 17.4%)
Adams was a massive disappointment after being gifted a huge opportunity in 2015. They were legitimately one of the worst WR's in the league, and I was ready to close the book on them as a bust. Thursday night may have changed all that. They racked up 13 catches for 132 yards and 2 TD's, leading all Week 7 WR's in scoring and targets (16!). Maybe we were too quick to write them off. Before the epic class of 2014, WR's used to take a full two or three years to develop into contributors, and Adams has the size, speed, and insane college production to make me think that they may have always had the potential and is actually figuring this whole thing out. The major downside for Adams, of course, is that they are still the #3 WR on the Packers depth chart behind Jordy Nelson and Randall Cobb. Nelson looks a step slow compared to what we're used to, and the big-bodied Adams has been Rodgers favorite target in the red zone this season (five TDs in six games). With no healthy, talented RB's to speak of, the Packers may be forced to air it out 40-50 times a game and make three WR's fantasy viable.
Verdict: Add in all 10+ leagues
3. Devontae Booker – RB – DEN (ESPN Ownership: 14.2%)
Booker's snap share has increased each week, and they actually out-snapped C.J. Anderson against Houston, posting a 17-83-1 rushing line. If this backfield is going to be a 50/50 split like it looks like it will be, both Booker and Anderson should be mid-tier RB2's going forward, with RB1 potential if either one gets hurt.
Verdict: Add in all 10+ team leagues
4. Ty Montgomery – WR/RB – GB (ESPN Ownership: 20.1%)
Green Bay's RB situation is probably the most confounding situation in fantasy right now. ALL of the RB's on the Packers' opening day roster are hurt, most for a significant amount of time. Although the Packers traded for Chiefs backup Knile Davis, Ty Montgomery looks like the best RB on the roster right now, and he's not even a RB. Luckily for ESPN fantasy players, Montgomery will be given RB/WR eligibility, which is a big deal with all the byes coming up. They have 10 catches in each of the last two games, with most of them coming out of the backfield (80% of their snaps came at RB last Thursday.) Davis is sure to work into the offense once they get up to speed, but they have proven to be an average running back at best throughout their career. I think the Packers think they found something that works with Montgomery, and until Starks comes back, they should lead the Green Bay backfield in snaps and continue to rack up catches. He's a must-add in all PPR leagues and intriguing even in standard.
Verdict: Add in all 10+ leagues
5. Jack Doyle – TE – IND (ESPN Ownership: 14.1%)
Doyle opened the season with a two TD game, but was relatively quiet until starter Dwayne Allen went down with a high ankle sprain last week. With Doyle unleashed against Tennessee, they nabbed 9 catches for 78 yards and a TD. Allen's absence could last a few more weeks, and during that time Doyle should be an every week starter at TE.
Verdict: Add in 10+ team leagues
6. Donte Moncrief – WR – IND (ESPN Ownership: 45.6%)
Moncrief has been cleared to practice this week, and with the Colts WR corps banged up, they are sorely needed. They could play as early as this week, but I think next week is more likely. I see them as a high-end WR3 once he's fully healthy.
Verdict: Add in 10+ team leagues
7. Mike Gillislee – RB – BUF (ESPN Ownership: 6%)
Buffalo strangely let LeSean McCoy play after they had been labeled doubtful all week with a hamstring injury, and they predictably aggravated the injury in the loss. It's unclear how long they will be out (if at all), but the Buffalo running game had been fantastic before today's game against Miami and Gillislee would get the majority of the work if McCoy misses time. The downside is that Buffalo gets New England, Seattle, and then a bye, so Gillislee may only be usable for one week at most.
Verdict: Add if you need a week 8 spot start or are the LeSean McCoy owner
8. Cole Beasley – WR – DAL(ESPN Ownership: 52.6%)
Once again, Beasley is a must-own in PPR leagues. He'll be a great bye week fill-in in standard leagues as well.
Verdict: Add in all PPR leagues
9. Chris Thompson – RB – WSH (ESPN Ownership: 14.2%)
Matt Jones continues to have ball security issues and Chris Thompson continues to play well. Coach Jay Gruden conceded this week that Rob Kelley may get more work, but Thompson is the more dynamic player and is easier to rely on week-to-week. They had 12 rushes for 73 yards to go along with their 7 catches for 40 against Detroit. He's a good flex play against in week 8 against Cincinnati for a bye-stricken team, and then can probably be safely dropped during the Redskins week 9 bye.
Verdict: Add in 12+ team leagues and all PPR leagues
10. Knile Davis – RB – GB (ESPN Ownership: 34.5%)
It's the All-Packer week on the waiver wire! Davis has shown that they can produce given massive volume. I don't see them getting that, but he's worth adding just in case Green Bay does have big plans for him. Who knows at this point.
Verdict: Add in 12+ team leagues
Honorable Mention: Brandon Lafell/WR/CIN, Marquise Goodwin/WR/BUF
Preemptive Strike: Dion Lewis/RB/NE, Corey Coleman/WR/CLE
Holds
1. Jerick McKinnon – RB – MIN (ESPN Ownership: 79.4%)
McKinnon was dinged up against Philadelphia and was outsnapped by Matt Asiata. Asiata was inefficient and terrible in pass protection, though, so I'm keeping McKinnon on my rosters while they head into a nice stretch of games including CHI, DET, and WSH.
Drops
1. Arian Foster – RB- MIA (ESPN Ownership: 77.1%)
This is Jay Ajayi's backfield, and Foster is reportedly retiring.
2. Derrick Henry – RB – TEN (ESPN Ownership: 51.3%)
I love Henry's talent and situation (should Demarco Murray get hurt) but Henry's snaps have declined each week and they are nothing more than a Murray handcuff. He'll be tough to hold through the bye weeks.
3. Kenneth Dixon – RB – BAL (ESPN Ownership: 23.9%)
It may be Dixon's time at some point, but that time isn't now. They only had one carry this week and is going into a bye.
4. Travis Benjamin – WR – SD (ESPN Ownership: 87%)
Benjamin was outsnapped by both Tyrell Williams and Dontrelle Inman yesterday, and while they have major weekly upside, it's going to almost impossible to predict when those big weeks will come. Philip Rivers loves to spread the ball around, and between those three WRs, Hunter Henry, Antonio Gates, and Melvin Gordon, he's doing just that. I would hold onto Benjamin if I could, but I'm NOT starting them in week 8 against Denver, and if that means they have to be dropped to start someone else, I'm willing to do that.
The first rule when reading any book is to finish it. I mentioned this before. But it's worth mentioning again. If you have a book on investing you think you can learn from – like Ben Graham's Security Analysis – and you read it badly, you'll still have read it. There is no way you can read it so that you are worse off for having read it. You may have wasted some of your time. But I doubt it. Often, even if you read a book without understanding it, you'll find that it may help you understand other books. Especially other books by the same author. Or other books in the same “tradition”.
The tradition we'll be talking about is value investing. I'm not going to define that camp too narrowly. In fact, I'm going to put the ultimate growth investor – Phil Fisher – in that group. I'm also going to put Peter Lynch in there.
I'm not a huge fan of canons in reading. These are basically reading lists of material that others often read, think worth reading, and are the accepted listed of stuff worth reading. You can define it in other ways. But that definition will work for us here.
Of course, there is a value investing canon. I may want you to read books I think are really helpful – in fact, I know were really helpful to my own investing – and yet I can't claim they are part of the value investing canon.
Why not?
Some don't count as investing books. I think it's worth your time to read “Hidden Champions of the 21st Century”, the Jim Collins books, and the Chris Zook books. But they aren't marketed as investing books. Their authors don't really claim they are investing books. They are business books. So they're not part of the canon.
The other issue is when a book is very recent. A good example of this is “The Outsiders”. I would put that book near the top of any reading list for value investors. But, it just came out. A lot of people haven't read it.
Lesser works by great authors are often not included. I think this is the biggest mistake. And one you should ignore – as I'll show in a second. For me, any reading list should be a list of authors, not a list of books. I'm not going to recommend you read “Security Analysis” but skip “The Interpretation of Financial Statements”. If I say it's good to read Ben Graham, then it's especially good to read as much Ben Graham as possible.
I'm spoiling things a bit here – jumping ahead – but I'm going to suggest you should read Ben Graham. What should you read?
Here's a good list of things Ben Graham wrote that you should definitely read:
1. The Intelligent Investor
2. Security Analysis
3. The Interpretation of Financial Statements
4. Benjamin Graham on Investing
5. Benjamin Graham Building a Profession
Why those 5 books?
Graham wrote a few other books. And a couple out of those 5 – Benjamin Graham on Investing and Benjamin Graham Building a Profession – are just reprints of articles they wrote.
You want to think of reading books as having a chat with the author of those books. What you're trying to do is get tools – practical ideas – from the author. You don't need them to write a book to get that. You can get it from their articles, their shareholder letters, their speeches, etc.
Ben Graham wrote articles. And when you read those articles together with their 3 books on investing, you learn a lot.
Once you've decided to read Ben Graham, it's important that you immediately collect all the stuff they wrote that you have an interest in reading. I would suggest buying it. If you have a Kindle, buy it that way – it's less intimidating to look at the length of everything you've just accumulated.
You want to buy everything the man wrote – not quite, but we'll get to that – because it'll help you understand everything else they wrote. Basically, the more you read of the same author, the more familiar their ideas become. Most importantly, the clearer you get about the stuff they aren't saying. This unspoken knowledge is often one of the biggest practical takeaways from any book.
I also want to talk about the last two reasons a book may not be canon. And by canon, I mean just that people you talk to – other value investors – haven't read the book, haven't heard of the book, don't know other who have read it, or don't think you need to bother reading it.
One reason a book may not be canon is if it includes extraneous stuff. The title can also hurt in this respect. So, “Benjamin Graham Building a Profession” may get overlooked by folks who think it is about CFA type stuff. In a sense, it is. But only a small part is explicitly about professional concerns that aren't primarily actual analysis. There's a lot to be learned even from that book. The title – and the first few chapters – may confuse people as to what it's about.
Finally, a book may not be canon because it's hard to get a hold of. I like Ben Graham's memoirs. There are tons of stuff in it that won't interest value investors. But there's also little snippets that really, really will. I find the book fascinating. And it helps me understand Ben Graham – especially as an actual investor.
Here's the problem. That book is out of print. New copies (meaning copies in excellent condition) often sell for $100 to $200. You have to work a little to find the book. I don't. I've managed to buy a couple copies over the years and have kept them (since they're hard to come by). Can I recommend you read it?
No. If you're ever talking to someone and they own the book and would be happy to lend it to you – go ahead, read it. If you've got access to a library that will lend it out – go ahead, read it. I like the book. But there's not enough purely about value investing in it for me to send you on an old book hunt.
So, I'll use Ben Graham as our example of close reading. First, you gather all the stuff I think you should read. Once again, that is:
1. The Intelligent Investor
2. Security Analysis
3. The Interpretation of Financial Statements
4. Benjamin Graham on Investing
5. Benjamin Graham Building a Profession
Then you read it all through without taking notes or anything like that. You break the book up into manageable chunks of time. Fit it into your daily schedule. A good rule of thumb would be to find no more than 90 minutes of time sometime during your day to read the book. Some people may find they have less than 90 minutes. This advice is really only relevant for non-readers. Some people read a book every day for about 90 minutes. Growing up, I never saw my mom read for less than that. So many people can find a place for this kind of reading in their schedule if they really try.
If you can't find 90 minutes – find 60 minutes or 30 minutes or 20 minutes. I wouldn't recommend reading for more than 90 minutes at a time. You'll get bored. I wouldn't really recommend focusing on any one task – really focusing – for more than about 90 minutes. And 60 minutes is fine if an hour is all you have. Just do it every day and you'll find 60 minutes a day works way better than a few hours once a week or whenever you feel you can binge read.
Now you go back to the books you've finished. You've read everything of Graham's you want to read. But you haven't taken apart what they wrote. How do you do that?
Again, you do it in manageable chunks.
Here's an important – but not the most famous – bit from Chapter 8 of The Intelligent Investor:
“The holder of marketable shares actually has a double status, and with it the privilege of taking advantage of either at their choice. On the one hand their position is analogous to that of a minority shareholder or silent partner in a private business. Here their results are entirely dependent on the profits of the enterprise or on a change in the underlying value of its assets. They would usually determine the value of such a private business interest by calculating their share net worth as shown in the most recent balance sheet. On the other hand, the common stock investor holds a piece of paper, an engraved stock certificate, which can be sold in a matter of minutes at a price which varies from moment to moment – when the market is open, that is – and often is far removed from the balance sheet value.”
How do we know this is an important bit of text? How do we know to zoom in on this?
Well, we have a few clues. One, we may – or may not – know that Warren Buffett mentions Chapter 8 and Chapter 20 as being the most important in Ben Graham's writing. Two, we may know the Mr. Market metaphor and see its relation to this bit.
Metaphors are very important clues to how an author thinks. Often, they are the most important clue. In this case, we have several uses of analogs – either metaphor or simile – that compare aspects of one thing to aspects of another.
One of these metaphors is entirely unwritten. Graham never uses the word “option”. However, a close reading of the opening of this bit of text drums the idea of option into our head. I've highlighted the words where Graham calls “option” to mind:
“The holder of marketable shares actually has a double status, and with it the privilege of taking advantage of either at their choice.”
What is a privilege? It's a right. If you think about the definition of an option, it's pretty much “the right but not the obligation” to buy a stock. Graham's description is actually suggesting a double option in the market. You can either exercise a right to buy or a right to sell at two different levels set by Mr. Market. They make this part very clear in the actual Mr. Market metaphor.
So, the option analog for a common stock investor, is that they can always choose to:
· Buy at a certain price
· Sell at a certain price
· Behave like a private business owner
That is what Ben Graham's Mr. Market metaphor is all about. So analogs are the most important part of close reading.
Terms can be important. But it depends on the writer. Graham uses less technical jargon than you might expect. However, Graham writes very, very densely.
For an example of an author who does not write densely – see Phil Fisher.
Put Graham and Fisher next to each other. There is nothing to be unpacked in a Fisher paragraph. There is everything to be unpacked in a Graham paragraph.
This is mostly a matter of syntax. How they actually choose to order and arrange words, phrases, sentences, and paragraphs.
Graham writes like a philosopher. When they are difficult to read – and I personally don't think they ever are, so I may not be the best judge of this – they are difficult because of the density of the thought content relative to the words used to express that content.
Graham often defines things, sets up their relations, mentions the limits of where this holds true, etc. all within a couple sentences of each other. They especially do not exaggerate for effect.  They are a very literal writer. You can pull their quotes out of context and they will rarely contradict their overall meaning.
This is not true for most writers. You can make any writer look like an idiot by snipping one paragraph from an 800 page book and ignoring the thrust of the rest of it.
This is precisely what you don't want to do as someone hoping to learn from a book. You need to get the gist of an author before you can really get the gist of each of their books. You may also want to get the gist of each book before you get the gist of small sections of that book.
Personally, I think that's less important. I think – if you understand Graham well enough – I should be able to drop you in the middle of one of their books and have it make sense. This should be true even if you never get to read the beginning or end of the book, browse the table of contents, etc. You should know the parts of what they say well enough because you know the man overall.
That's why the best way to read closely is to do the opposite of what you'd expect. Start by picking one guy. Read everything they wrote. Then – and only then – go in for a closer read.
When you do go in for a closer read, focus on analogs. These come in 5 flavors:
1. Metaphors
2. Similes
3. Coined terms
4. Thought experiments
5. Parables
If all you can understand of an author is their metaphors, similes, the new terms they coined, their thought experiments, and their parables – you'll understand 90% of what they wrote. You'll certainly understand more than most people.
Few “big ideas” can be written in a memorable way without using one of those 5 delivery methods. Definition based writing is an exception. Of all the value investors, Graham uses it the most. And even they can be understood without much focus on their definitions – as long as you understand their coined terms.
Margin of safety is a good example. Graham didn't create that term. It was in common use in bond analysis. But they used the same words to refer to a broader concept. They compared bonds and stocks – legal protection and practical protection – in such a way that they could make margin of safety a bridge between the two.
In this way, they coined a term. It existed before him. But the meaning of margin of safety – within the value investing tradition – is the meaning Graham gave it.
So you need to know how Graham defines margin of safety. You don't need to know how they define terms they didn't coin. That's a mistake many readers make. They assume that all terms are equal. They aren't. Ignore commonly accepted jargon. Focus all your efforts – as far as definitions – on understanding the terms an author coined himself.
And always start your close reading on a foundation of having read the author as much as possible. That's the key to all of this. Once you find an author who interests you, collect everything they wrote. Don't read it closely. Just read it.
Then you can zoom in.
Where should you zoom in first? I said if there is any value investing canon it should be a reading lists of authors rather than books. I would suggest these 6 authors:
1. Warren Buffett
2. Charlie Munger
3. Ben Graham
4. Phil Fisher

Mass protests in Ukraine demand ouster of President Yanukovich
By Alex Lantier
9 December 2013
Protesters marched in Kiev yesterday demanding the ouster of Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovich, in the largest of a series of pro-European Union protests against Yanukovich's November 21 decision to abandon an association agreement with the EU.
The right-wing parties leading the protests in coordination with EU officials and politicians had called for a “million man march.” Ultimately, some 250,000 to 300,000 people gathered on Maïdan (Independence) Square. It was the largest protest in Kiev since the 2004 “color revolution” organized by US and European imperialism—the so-called Orange Revolution that ousted the pro-Russian Yanukovich and brought the pro-Western tandem of President Viktor Yushchenko and Prime Minister Yulya Tymoshenko to power.
Protesters on Nezalezhnost Square chanted “Resignation! Resignation!” while listening to speeches on the square. Some subsequently fanned out to occupy government buildings in Kiev.
The reactionary assembly of speakers on Nezalezhnost Square included representatives of various billionaire oligarchs, far-right groups, and patriarchs of the Russian Orthodox Church.
Evgenia Tymoshenko, the daughter of former prime minister and billionaire natural gas magnate Yulya Tymoshenko, whom Yanukovich has jailed, read a message from their mother calling for Yanukovich's “immediate” ouster.
Oleg Tyagnibok, a neo-Nazi from the far-right nationalist Svoboda (Freedom) party notorious for their anti-Semitic statements, denounced Yanukovich's government for working out trade deals with Russia instead of the EU. They declared: “Today, they fall on their knees in front of the president of Russia and surrender us to the [Russian] customs union… We demand to make public what these secret negotiations were about. They bring us back to the time of Stalinism.”
A group of protesters carrying Svoboda party flags pulled down and destroyed a statue of Vladimir Lenin, the co-leader with Leon Trotsky of the October Revolution of 1917 that founded the Soviet Union.
The situation remains explosive, with protesters blockading government buildings and fearing a crackdown by the security forces. A bitter factional struggle is taking place between oligarchs such as Tymoshenko who are oriented to the EU, and others around Yanukovich who seek closer relations with Moscow.
After the failure of last week's motion of no-confidence in parliament against Yanukovich, there are signs of demoralization in the opposition.
The French daily Le Monde wrote, “On social media, the million-man march was renamed ‘last-chance march'… The leaders who speak each day on Nezalezhnost Square no longer call for ‘revolution,' as they did at the beginning of the week, and ‘behind-the-scenes' negotiations are ongoing with the government, indicated journalist Vitaly Portnikov,” a journalist with the US government-backed Radio Free Europe.
The protest leaders themselves are aware that, even among the more right-wing social layers they have mobilized, there is only limited support for integration into the free-market EU. “People have dignity,” protest organizer Svitlana Zalischuk told the New York Times. “This is why they are here: not because they are against Yanukovich, not because they are for the European Union, but because they have dignity, and they want to live with dignity.”
Another protester added that they were primarily opposed to the government's decision to “beat students and innocent people.” They continued, “The question of Europe doesn't motivate everybody. We hope the people will be heard and the government will resign.”
The ability of such right-wing protests to proceed and win support among broader layers of the population, who do not necessarily support the EU's social austerity agenda, reflects the deep crisis of political perspective facing the Eastern European working class.
The anti-communism that has come to dominate political life in the ex-Soviet republics has left these countries easy prey to looting by international capital and political manipulation by Western imperialism and corrupt Ukrainian and Russian oligarchs. The deep social discontent that exists finds expression mainly through movements that are exploited by reactionary, even fascist forces and agencies of imperialism. These movements are then used to turn the political situation even further to the right and mount further social attacks on the population.
Ukraine is one of Europe's poorest countries, with the world's second-highest mortality rate (15.75 per 1,000, second after South Africa). Social anger is rising after a budget crisis led the Yanukovich government to cut off unemployment insurance to hundreds of thousands of workers in June.
The major banks and financial markets have cut off lending to Ukraine, which is expected to need $18 billion in emergency financing by March. The state currently has enough financing only for two months of operations. There is rising fear of a possible new devaluation of the national currency, the hryvnia, which collapsed during the hyper-inflation of the early 1990s, following the dissolution of the USSR in 1991 and the restoration of capitalism by the Stalinist bureaucracy.
The EU is working with the International Monetary Fund (IMF), demanding deep austerity measures—a 40 percent increase in gas and heating prices, state budget cuts, and freezes on minimum and average wages—in exchange for a $15 billion loan. These cuts aim to deepen the exploitation of the working class and make Ukraine more profitable for European businesses that would set up operations after Ukraine established closer relations with the EU.
The pro-EU and pro-Russian oligarchic factions are both maneuvering to keep the billions they looted from the theft of state property and the restoration of capitalism and to place the full burden of the financial crisis on the working class. This is the more fundamental reason why the Yanukovich government has not sought to mobilize other social layers against the right-wing, pro-EU protests.
The feuding between these different oligarchic factions offers free play for manipulation by European imperialism, which—while it savagely loots Greece and tramples on mass popular opposition to austerity at home—hypocritically poses as the defender of democracy in Ukraine.
Yesterday, Germany's Der Spiegel reported that German Chancellor Angela Merkel had decided to “build up” Ukrainian professional boxer Vitaly Klitchko as the “leading oppositionist and rival candidate to President Viktor Yanukovich.” Klitchko is scheduled to travel to Brussels in the middle of the month to meet with Merkel and representatives of the European People's Party, the federation of right-wing and Christian Democratic parties in the EU countries.
Klitchko's Udar (“Punch”) party already receives “logistical support” from Merkel's Christian Democratic Union and the CDU's Konrad Adenauer Foundation, Der Spiegel reported.
As for Svoboda, it has close ties to France's neo-fascist National Front (FN), working with the FN's Bruno Gollnisch and Hungary's anti-Semitic Jobbik Party within the Alliance of European National Movements.

In January the BPC inquiry team announced their initial findings on what went wrong in the general election polls. Today they have published their full final report. The overall conclusions haven't changed, we've just got a lot more detail. For a report about polling methodology written by a bunch of academics it's very readable, so I'd encourage you to read the whole thing, but if you're not in the mood for a 120 page document about polling methods then my summary is below:
Polls getting it wrong isn't new
The error in the polls last year was worse than in many previous years, but wasn't unprecedented. In 2005 and 2010 the polls performed comparatively well, but going back further there has often been an error in Labour's favour, particularly since 1983. Last year's error was the largest since 1992, but was not that different from the error in 1997 or 2001. The reason it was seen as so much worse was twofold – first, it meant the story was wrong (the polls suggested Labour would be the largest party, when actually there was a Tory majority, in 1997 and 2001 the only question was scale of the Labour landslide), second in 2015 all the main polls were wrong – in years like 1997 and 2001 there was a substantial average error in the polls, but some companies managed to get the result right, so it looked like a failure of particular pollsters rather than the industry as a whole.
Not everything was wrong: small parties were right, but Scotland wasn't
There's a difference between getting a poll right, and being seen to get a poll right. All the pre-election polls were actually pretty accurate for the Lib Dems, Greens and UKIP (and UKIP was seen as the big challenge!) it was seen as a disaster because they got the big two parties wrong, and therefore they got the story wrong. It's the latter bit that's important – in Scotland there was also a polling error (the SNP were understated, Labour overstated) but it was largely unremarked because it was a landslide. As the report says, “underestimating the size of a landslide is considerably less problematic than getting the result of an election wrong”
There was minimal late swing, if any
Obviously it is possible for people to change their minds in those 24 hours between the final poll fieldwork and the actual vote. People really can tell a pollster they'll vote party A on Wednesday, but chicken out and vote party B on Thursday. The Scottish referendum was probably an example of genuine late swing – YouGov recontacted the same people they interviewed in their final pre-referendum poll on polling day itself, and found a small net swing towards NO. However, when pollsters get it wrong and blame late swing it does always sound a bit like a lame excuse “Oh, it was right when we did it, people must have changed their minds”.
To conclude there was late swing I'd want to see some pretty conclusive evidence. The inquiry team looked, but didn't find any. Changes from the penultimate to final polls suggested any ongoing movement was towards Labour, not the Conservatives. A weighted average of re-contact surveys found change of only 0.6% from Lab to Con (and that was including some re-contacts from late campaign surveys, rather than final call surveys. Including only re-contact of final call surveys the average movement was towards Labour)
There probably weren't any Shy Tories
“Shy Tories” is the theory that people who were not natural Tories were reluctant to admit to interviewers (or perhaps even to themselves!) that they were going to vote Conservative. If people had lied during the election campaign but admitted it afterwards, this would have shown up as late swing and it did not. This leaves the possibility that people lied before the election and consistently lied afterwards as well. This is obviously very difficult to test conclusively, but the inquiry team don't believe the circumstantial evidence supports it. Not least, if there was a problem with shy Tories we could reasonably have expected polls conducted online without a human interviewer to have shown a higher Tory vote – they did not.
Turnout models weren't that good, but it didn't cause the error
Most pollsters modelled turnout using a simple method of asking people how likely they were to vote on a 0-10 scale. The inquiry team tested this by looking at whether people in re-contact surveys reported actually voting. For most pollsters this didn't work out that well, however, it is was not the cause of the error – the inquiry team re-ran the data replacing pre-election likelihood to vote estimates with whether people reported actually voting after the election and they were just as wrong. As the inquiry team put it – if pollsters had known in advance which respondents would and would not vote, they would not have been any more accurate.
Differential turnout – that Labour voters were more likely to say they were going to vote and then fail to do so – was also dismissed as a factor. Voter validation tests (checking poll respondents against the actual marked register) did not suggest Labour voters were any more likely to lie about voting than Tory voters.
Note that in this sense turnout is about the difference between people *saying* they'll vote (and pollsters estimates of if they'll vote) and whether they actually do. That didn't cause the polling error. However, the polling error could still have been caused by samples containing people who are too likely to vote, something that is an issue of turnout but which comes under the heading of sampling. It's the difference between having young non-voters in your samples and them claiming they'll vote when they won't, and not having them in your sample to begin with.
Lots of other things that people have suggested were factors, weren't factors
The inquiry put to bed various other theories too – postal votes were not the problem (samples contained the correct proportion of them), excluding overseas voters was not the problem (there are only 0.2% of the electorate), voter registration was not the problem (in the way it showed up it would have been functionally identical to misreporting of turnout – people who told pollsters they were going to vote, but did not – for the narrow purpose of polling error it doesn't matter why they didn't vote).
The main cause of the error was unrepresentative samples
The reason the polls got it wrong in 2015 was the sampling. The BPC inquiry team reached this conclusion to begin with by using the Sherlock Holmes method – eliminating all the other possibilities, leaving just one which must be true. However they also had positive evidence to back up the conclusion – the first is the comparison with the random probability surveys conducted by the BES and BSA later in the year, where past recall more closely resembled the actual election result, the second are some observable shortcomings within the samples. The age distribution within bands was off, the geographical distribution of the vote was wrong (polls underestimated Tory support more in the South East and East). Most importantly in my view, polling samples contained far too many people who vote, particularly among younger people – presumably because they contain people too engaged and interested in politics. Note that these aren't necessarily the specific sample errors that caused the error: the BPC team cited them as evidence that sampling was off, not as the direct causes.
In the final polls there was no difference between telephone and online surveys
Looking at the final polls there was no difference at all between telephone and online surveys. The average Labour lead in the final polls was 0.2% in phone polls, and 0.2% in online polls. The average error compared to the final result was 1.6% for phone polls and 1.6% for online polls.
However, at points during the 2010-2015 Parliament there were differences between the modes. In the early part of the Parliament online polls were more favourable towards the Conservatives, for a large middle part of the Parliament phone polls were more favourable, during 2014 the gap disappeared entirely, phone polls started being more favourable towards the Tories during the election campaign, but came bang into line for the final polls. The inquiry suggest that could be herding, but that there is no strong reason to expect mode effects to be stable over time anyway – “mode effects arise from the interaction of the political environment with the various errors to which polling methods are prone. The magnitude and direction of these mode effects in the middle of the election cycle may be quite different to those that are evident in the final days of the campaign.”
The inquiry couldn't rule out herding, but it doesn't seem to have caused the error
That brings us to herding – the final polls were close to each other. To some observers they looked suspiciously close. Some degree of convergence is to be expected in the run to the election, many pollsters increased their sample sizes for their final polls so the variance between figures should be expected to fall. However, even allowing for that polls were still closer than would have been expected. Several pollsters made changes to their methods during the campaign and these did explain some of the convergence. It's worth noting that all the changes increased the Conservative lead – that is, they made the polls *more* accurate, not less accurate.
The inquiry team also tested to see what the result would have been if every pollster had used the same method. That is, if you think pollsters had deliberately chosen methodological adjustments that made their polls closer to each other, what if you strip out all those individual adjustments? Using the same method across the board the results would have ranged from a four point Labour lead to a two point Tory lead. Polls would have been more variable… but every bit as wrong.
How the pollsters should improve their methods
Dealing with the main crux of the problem, unrepresentative samples, the inquiry have recommended that pollsters take action to improve how representative their samples are within their current criteria, and to investigate potential new quotas and weights that correlate with the sort of people who are under-represented in polls, and with voting intention. They are not prescriptive as to what the changes might be – on the first point they float possibilities about longer fieldwork and more callbacks in phone polls, and more incentives for under-represented groups in online polls. For potential new weighting variables they don't suggest much at all, worrying that if such variables existed pollsters would already be using them, but we shall see what changes pollsters end up making to their sampling to address these recommendations.
The inquiry also makes some recommendations about turnout, don't know and asking if people have voted by post already. These seem perfectly sensible recommendations in themselves (especially asking if people have already voted by post, which several pollsters already do anyway), but given none of these things contributed to the error in 2015 they are more improvements for the future than addressing the failures of 2015.
And how the BPC should improve transparency
If the recommendations for the pollsters are pretty vague, the recommendations to the BPC are more specific, and mostly to do with transparency. Pollsters who are members of the BPC are already supposed to be open about methods, but the inquiry suggest they change the rules to make this more explicit – pollsters should give the exact variables and targets they weight to, and flag up any changes they make to their methods (the BPC are adopting these changes forthwith). They also make recommendations about registering polls and providing microdata to help any future inquiries, and for changes in how confidence margins are reported in polls. The BPC are looking at exactly how to do that in due course, but I think I'm rather less optimistic than the inquiry team about the difference it will make. The report says “Responsible media commentators would be much less inclined, however, to report a change in party support on the basis of one poll which shows no evidence of statistically significant change.” Personally I think *responsible* media commentators are already quite careful about how they report polls, the problem is that not all media commentators are responsible…
There's no silver bullet
The inquiry team don't make recommendations for specific changes that would have corrected the problems and don't pretend there is an easy solution. Indeed, they point out that even the hugely expensive “gold standard” BES random probability surveys still managed to get the Conservatives and UKIP shares of the vote outside of the margin of error. They do think there are improvements that can be made though – and hopefully there are (hopefully the changes that some pollsters have already introduced are improving matters already). They also say it would be good if stakeholders were more realistic about the limits of polling, of how accurately it is really possible to measure people's opinions.
Polling accuracy shouldn't be black and white. It shouldn't be a choice between “polls are the gospel truth” and “polls are worthless, ignore them all”. Polls are a tool, with advantages and limitations. There are limits on how well we can model and measure the views of a complex and mobile society, but that should be a reason for caveats and caution, not a reason to give up. As I wrote last year despite the many difficulties there are in getting a representative sample of the British public, I still think those difficulties are surmountable, and that ultimately, it's still worth trying to find out and quantify what the public think.
Embattled former Obama national security adviser Susan Rice was set to appear in Rochester, NY, on Saturday evening for a "Women Helping Girls" event at the Kodak Center for Performing Arts. But the night before, Rochester was informed that the "Evening With Ambassador Susan Rice" was called off due to – wait for it – a "ticketing error."
"GRAB of AAUW was very much looking forward to hosting Ambassador Susan E. Rice in Rochester to inspire young women who are soon to embark on their chosen careers," said VP of Development for AAUW Cheryl McKeiver. "Unfortunately, we regret that we must cancel the conference originally scheduled for Saturday, April 8 due to a ticketing error."
Susan Rice has been in the news a lot. But they won't be in Rochester Saturday.

Interesting.
McKeiver added that Rice agreed to come back to Rochester "in the coming months." The city in upstate New York won't hold its breath.
Not that anyone would even question the sincerity of this "ticketing error" excuse, but Rice just so happens to be making waves in the media these days for unsavory, possibly illegal, behavior.
According to Fox News, last week, multiple sources said that the former Obama adviser repeatedly requested the unmasking of the names of Trump transition team members who were incidentally caught in surveillance. Fox News reports:
The unmasked names, of people associated with Donald Trump, were then sent to all those at the National Security Council, some at the Defense Department, then-Director of National Intelligence James Clapper and then-CIA Director John Brennan – essentially, the officials at the top, including former Rice deputy Ben Rhodes. The names were part of incidental electronic surveillance of candidate and President-elect Trump and people close to him, including family members, for up to a year before they took office.
Former U.S. Attorney Joseph diGenova told The Daily Caller that at the request of Rice, the intelligence community created "detailed spreadsheets of the intercepted calls with unmasked Trump ​associates in perfectly legal conversations with individuals. The overheard conversations involved no illegal activity by anybody of the Trump associates, or anyone they were speaking with. In short, the only apparent illegal activity was the unmasking of the people in the calls."
Rice was also recently blasted for their past media appearances in which they praised the Obama Administration's success of ridding Assad of all chemical weapons. This is false, of course, as Assad gassed their own people with chemical weapons just last week.
But, yes, we're sure it was a mere "ticketing error."

Two police officers and two animal rights advocates serendipitously discovered a dying dog on the side of a secluded road in the San Fernando Valley just in time to save its life.
The boxer, now named Bronx, was first found laying in pain by off-duty Los Angeles Police Department Officer Rick So on their usual route home.
The dog wasn't moving, and So thought they had been hit by a car due to the way their shoulder joints were protruding because they were so emaciated.
“As I kind of slowed down, they picked their head up and looked at me,” So said, and they immediately called their partner, Officer Charles Winzer, for backup.
"He had definitely been out for quite some time," Winzer said. "Boxers are a pretty large-breed dog and they were right about 50 pounds, if not under, when we got to him. They were literally just skin-wrapped bones when we found him, almost too weak to stand up."
The officers called animal control, but as they were waiting two good samaritans pulled over who happened to work for local rescue organizations.
"Being in rescue you see a lot of heartbreaking stories, and this was one of the worst," said Maral Mofrad, one of the animal rescue workers.
Mofrad asked the officers to give their time to find a rescue group to take them so they wouldn't go to a shelter, and within 20 minutes Border Buddies Rescue agreed to help.
"It was kind of all meant to be because I would never be in this spot at that time on a Monday," Mofrad said.
Bronx is now recovering at a foster and doing much better, but they are still searching for a forever home.
“It was just one of those things that couldn't have worked out any better,” Winzer said. “It was the right person in the right place at the right time.”

Earlier today, a mysterious streaming media device believed to be the next generation Fire TV surfaced in a new FCC filing. That assumption has been strengthened with the discovery of a new remote control (FCC ID: 2ADU9-3876, Model: DR49WK) and a new game controller (FCC ID:2ADU7-5487, Model:DE38UR) that have also appeared in new FCC filings on the same day. As you would expect, confidentiality requests are keeping the most revealing documents hidden, but one interesting piece of information can be determined from the available FCC documents. Both the new remote and the new game controller connect to the new Fire TV via WiFi and not via bluetooth like the current generation peripherals. Could it be due to the inclusion of onboard 3.5mm audio jacks?
The new suspected next generation Fire TV device does contain bluetooth capabilities. The FCC documents even note that a bluetooth mouse was used with the device during testing. However, it appears Amazon has opted to use 802.11a/g wireless as the communication protocol for their new remote and controller. This could explain why the Fire OS 5 Developer Preview oddly creates its own WiFi hotspot. The new controllers may search for and connect to this wireless hotspot. Since existing Fire TVs running the Fire OS 5 preview are creating a wifi hotspot, it could mean that these new remotes and controllers are backwards compatible with the existing Fire TV and Fire TV Stick.
Choosing to use WiFi over bluetooth has several advantages. For starters, signal range is more than tripled, increasing from around 30ft with bluetooth to over 100ft with WiFi. Additionally, data transfer rates for 802.11a/g wireless are more than double those of bluetooth. With bluetooth you have a theoretical maximum transfer speed of 24 Mbits per second, while the WiFi variant used caps out at 54 Mbits per second.
The question begs to be asked, do these new peripherals have a reason to need more range and transfer rates? The most likely reason to switch to WiFi over bluetooth is if the new remote and game controller include a headphone audio jack for private listening. With this new found information, I'd say that's looking like a very probable new feature for the next generation Fire TV. Watch out Roku.

Iran was traditionally a trading partner of Western economies. Even post-revolutionary Iran relied more on trade with Western rather than Eastern partners or developing countries. However, in the past few years, stringent sanctions imposed by Western governments, as well as the growth of Eastern trading partners, have changed Iran's trading patterns. This article will take a closer look at two important trends: the transformation of Iranian exports and the changes in Iran's trading partners.
The included table summarizes the country's trade statistics over the past two Iranian calendar years, plus a projection for the current Iranian calendar year, which ends on March 20, 2014.
Oil and gas exports initially took a dive in 2012 due to EU sanctions on the purchase of Iranian oil and US sanctions on the Iranian Central Bank, which undermined exports to non-European buyers of Iranian oil. However, growing gas and gas condensate exports will be the main factor behind the growth of petroleum exports in the current Iranian calendar year.
Indicators All figures in billions US$ 1390 (ended March 20, 2012) 1391 (ended March 20, 2013) 1392 (ends March 20, 2014) * Oil and gas exports 81.7 66.2 75.8 Non-petroleum exports (including services) 31.9 34.1 34.8 Imports 71.0 62.3 59.9 Trade Surplus 34.5 38.0 50.7 Main Source: Iran Economics Magazine (Eqtessad-e Iran), June 2013 *Projected
The real success story in Iranian exports is the expansion of the country's potential in non-oil exports. In fact, the government has set a goal to achieve balanced trade between Iran's non-oil exports and the country's imports. Admittedly, the non-oil exports such as cement and petrochemicals are also partly dependent on the availability of inexpensive energy in the country. Nonetheless, the country is promoting non-oil exports to reduce its dependency on oil export revenues.
Based on the latest statistics from the Iran Customs Administration, in the first three months of the current Iranian calendar year, which began on March 21, 2013, the value of Iran's non-oil exports reached $7.7 billion while the value of imports stood at $9.4 million, i.e., a quarterly non-oil trade deficit of $1.7 billion.
Taking into account the oil and gas exports, the country is producing a healthy trade surplus that will help the economy regain a new balance after years of failed economic and trade policies under the Ahmadinejad government. Though severe banking sanctions have impeded the repatriation of export revenues, Iran will develop new mechanisms to repatriate these funds and to boost its economy.
In fact, one of the consequences of the current banking sanctions is the growth of a new type of barter trade. The sanctions-related difficulties in making payments for imports have compelled many Iranian merchants to look for export opportunities in order to generate their own hard currency income outside Iran. The proceeds from exports are then used to import the needed goods — a method that circumvents banking transactions between Iran and foreign banks. The devaluation of the Iranian rial in 2012 has further facilitated the growth of non-oil exports from Iran — a welcome development for Iranian merchants.
Changing trade partners
In the 1990s, during the process of the country's post-war reconstruction, Iran introduced a pro-European foreign and trade policy, mainly focusing on trade with the EU, especially with Germany. For more than 15 years, Germany was Iran's largest trading partner followed by Japan, Italy and France.
The emergence of the Iranian nuclear stand-off and the consequent sanctions led to a gradual decline in trade with Western partners. This process was accompanied by trade growth between Iran and Asian partners such as China and India. The Iranian calendar year 1387, which ended on March 20, 2009, represented the first year in modern history that Iran had traded more with Eastern (Asian) countries compared with Western nations.
If we look at the official statistics of the first quarter of the current Iranian year, the ratio is 75% (Asian trading partners) and 25% (rest of the world). The 2012 EU-wide trade with Iran had dropped to 12.8 billion euros from 27.8 billion euros in 2011. Within the EU, Italy, Germany and Greece were the top trading partners of Iran. Evidently, the continued growth of Asian trading partners is also related to the fact that the same countries are also the main buyers of Iranian crude oil, i.e., China, India, Japan and South Korea.
Presently, Iran's main imports are automobiles, mobile phones, cigarettes, medical equipment, industrial equipment, barley and wheat, mostly imported from China, India, Turkey, the UAE, Germany, Switzerland and South Korea. The major exported items are petroleum, gas condensate, petrochemical products, iron ore concentrate, cement and bitumen.
The UAE features as one of Iran's top import and export trading partners because the UAE, especially Dubai, is used by many European and Asian companies as the location for the re-export of goods to Iran. Furthermore, Dubai-based traders are key players in managing Iran's international commodity exports in petrochemicals and petroleum products.
A final point on trading partners is the growing role of regional export markets for Iran. In fact, for non-oil exports, Iraq is the most significant market for Iranian products, with annual trade hitting $10 billion. Other regional markets such as Turkey, Afghanistan, Turkmenistan and Pakistan are also gaining in significance.
Outlook
The upcoming change of government in Iran will lead to new policies and initiatives. On one hand, the Rouhani government will attempt to secure some sanctions relief through creative nuclear diplomacy. On the other hand, there could be potential for reviving some Iran-EU trade in areas that are not hit by external sanctions, such as pharmaceuticals and medical equipment. Evidently, a lot will depend on the outcome of nuclear negotiations, which will be resumed after the official inauguration of the new government. Nonetheless, the process of reviving Iran-EU trade will take time.
The fact is that many businesspeople and government officials are not happy about the growing presence of Asian companies and products in the Iranian market. They argue that the lower quality of such products will increase the actual cost to the Iranian economy and believe that Iran should look for ways to reintroduce imports from the more developed economies. The combination of this tendency, as well as sanctions imposed by Western governments, will compel Iran to look for medium-quality products in countries such as South Korea, South Africa and Brazil, thus further boosting trade with emerging economies.
In the meantime, the new momentum generated by the June elections will push Iranian industrialists to develop export markets. Considering the growing trend of non-oil exports and the declining trend of imports (also clear in the above table), it would be conceivable that Iran will achieve its goal of a balanced non-oil trade by 2014.

Brandon Miller, pictured here in 2003 during their time as a member of Butler's men's basketball team, has been named the school's new basketball coach after Brad Stevens took the Boston Celtics job earlier this week. (Photo11: Indianapolis Star) Story Highlights Brandon Miller will be the new men's basketball coach at Butler
Miller is a former player at Butler, scoring more than 1,100 points in their career
They have been an assistant coach at Butler, Illinois and Ohio State
Three days after Brad Stevens shocked the sports world by leaving Butler to become the new head coach of the Boston Celtics, the search is over for Stevens' replacement.
Current Butler assistant and former Butler player Brandon Miller will be the next head coach of the Bulldogs, the school announced Saturday afternoon.
Fittingly, they were offered the job by their former coach, Barry Collier, who is Butler's athletic director.
"I was thrilled," Miller told USA TODAY Sports by phone Saturday evening. "It was a dream of mine to become a head coach, and to be able to become a head coach and your alma mater. It's Butler University, and with everything going on here with joining the new Big East ... there's excitement."
STARTING FIVE: Others who could make NCAA to NBA jump
Not surprisingly, Butler stayed within its family to find Stevens' replacement, and, like its past four coaches, it chose an assistant to take the reins of the program. This will also be Miller's first head coaching job.
At Saturday's news conference, Collier introduced Miller as a basketball coach, a rising star in the profession and, "most of all, a Butler Bulldog." It's been obvious, throughout the entire coaching search, that the priority was to hire a coach who understands the Butler Way and embraces the values of the program.
Miller, 34, certainly understands that, emphasizing during their news conference that the values Butler lives by "will not change." They would know; he's lived them. Miller graduated from the school in 2003 after winning three league championships, reaching the Sweet 16 and scoring more than 1,100 points.
They worked for former Butler coach and current Ohio State coach Thad Matta as a video coordinator and director of basketball operations before returning to Butler as an assistant for the 2007-08 season -- Stevens' first as a head coach. Miller went back to Ohio State for three years, then went to Illinois for one.
Miller returned to Butler in April as an assistant, a fortuitously timed move in hindsight.
"There was no guarantee that Brad Stevens was going to stay the head coach at Butler, but there was nothing in my mind that said they were going to leave," Miller said. "I knew it would have to take something really, really unique and special to leave. To be honest, it didn't even go through my head that they might not be here right now. When I joined, I joined to be an assistant coach.
"I had a great three months doing that."

Miller's first season as a head coach will coincide with Butler's first in the Big East. That, along with the inevitable pressure of replacing a coach who took this program to two national championship games, makes for a challenging first head coaching job.
"My philosophy, coaching and things that I believe in and stand for, a lot of those things are similar to Brad's," Miller said. "A lot of people we talk to in coaching are the same. (Brad and I) have kept in touch throughout the years, and we not only have a professional relationship, but a friendship. We talk ball, we talk Xs and Os.
"With that said, we aren't the same person. We don't coach the exact same way. I'll make tweaks, I'll make adjustments. I believe if you don't do that, that's not coaching. Brad Stevens did a great job being Brad Stevens. My goal is to be the best Brandon Miller I can be."

Dishonored was one of last year's most unexpected and rewarding titles. Its blend of careful stealth mechanics and, failing that, slick swordplay made for one of the most memorable gaming experiences of 2012. But it was the world of Dishonored that made it stand apart the most. The carefully crafted blend of high fantasy and bizarre, whale oil powered technology was one of the more darkly fascinating gaming landscapes in recent memory, but if the original title had one failing it was that it just didn't show us enough.
Dishonored's first story-based DLC, 'The Knife of Dunwall,' marks the return of both the mechanics and the world we loved so much before, and it seems as if developer Arkane really listened to the feedback as the game's world is more alive (in its weird, slowly dying sort of way) and twisted than ever. For the first time in the game you'll get to play as Daud, the assassin who killed the Empress at the beginning of the base title, and explore the whale oil extraction facilities that power this dark fantasy world. The resulting journey is visually and atmospherically compelling enough that it should be considered a requirement for fans of the original.
'The Knife of Dunwall' begins with a tour of the largest whale oil extraction facility in Dunwall. Run by the black-hearted Rothwhile, this facility slowly steals the humanity of all who work in it - Rothwhile's methods force employees to chop up living whales piece by piece using large circular saws. The longer a whale lives, the more oil can be extracted from it, so they're subjected to days, sometimes weeks of torture before finding the mercy of death. It is, as you may have gathered, a grim establishment and the perfect place to dispense a little justice.
Disturbing as it may be, the facility allows for some of the most striking visuals in the entire game. Walking under a massive whale suspended from the ceiling by a series of harnesses or fishing around inside the hollowed-out carcass of one of the creatures in search of a Bone Charm is not an experience you're likely to soon forget. Like most environments in Dishonored, the whaling facility is also a hub world in and of itself, and allows for several ways to complete your objectives. When it comes to many of the expansion's core objectives you won't find quite as many options as you're perhaps used to having, but the core decisions of sneaking, platforming or fighting do still inform the bulk of the gameplay.
As you move about the world, propaganda and thinly-veiled threats will blast out through loudspeakers situated around the facility. It adds to the expansion's oppressive atmosphere, but I couldn't help feeling the whole thing is starting to get played out, especially after the tour de force that was BioShock Infinite and its incredible use of environmental storytelling.
The core story of this expansion, perhaps like the story of the game itself, ultimately left me feeling a little empty. Events aren't either terribly complex, and although Daud speaks of repenting and redeeming himself, I was never quite sure what exactly made them want redemption in the first place. After all, he's a professional assassin and he's killed dozens of people before. Why start caring about the victims now? Quibbles aside, the story is enough to push the expansion forward and little more. It does what it needs to and sits back to let the player muck around in the game's decaying urban playground, which has always been the true draw of this style of gameplay.
At a cool ten bucks, 'The Knife of Dunwall' had me worried about its length before it released. The trend lately, it seems, is to release DLC that can be completed easily enough in an hour or two, and when dealing in such complicated worlds and mechanics a campaign of that length would be a snack that only served to rile up my hunger. Straightforward as it is, the story of this DLC does at least last much longer than has become the standard, especially if you go after all of the game's collectibles, which is practically a requirement since they all add to Daud's skillset. Sure you can complete it in around two hours if you really sprint through the thing, but playing properly should yield a solid four to five hours of play.
Aside from bringing in a series of fantastic new environments and telling a new story, 'The Knife of Dunwall' also tweaks a few of the skills and mechanics that the original game had in place. Instead of summoning a pack of hungry rats, for example, Daud summons an assassin. It's much less stealthy and kind of killed the way I played the original game, forcing me to re-evaluate some of the game's mechanics. At the same time, the assassin can be very helpful in the heat of combat.
Then there's the Void Gaze ability, which highlights important objects and enemies just like Corvo's vision ability did. Here, however, you'll have to upgrade Void Gaze with Runes in order to see enemies through walls and highlight hidden Bone Charms and Runes. In its default state, Void Gaze will only make the controller vibrate when you look in the direction of a collectible. It's far from useful until upgraded.
Finally, the Blink ability has been updated so that Daud cannot scale over ledges while holding a body over their shoulder. It makes sense and encourages more creative disposal of bodies, even as it does make the gameplay a little more challenging.
Speaking of challenging, 'The Knife of Dunwall' introduces a new enemy type in the whaling facility and they're quite the fighters. You've probably seen these hulking brutes in the DLC's promotional screenshots, but they're even tougher than they look. They wear armor that can shrug off bullets and arrows, meaning that you'll have to pump a solid five or six projectiles into them before they keel over. Their circular saws deal huge amounts of damage in mid to close range combat, and the machine guns that they for some reason have mounted beneath the saws can cut you down at range. Oh, and you can't take them down from behind like you can other enemies. They're frankly a little ridiculous, and they appear in such numbers that it can really put a damper on some of the exploration.
Enemy balancing and story simplicity aside, 'The Knife of Dunwall' is one of the strongest pieces of DLC on the market. It's a lengthy, meaty trip through a world equal parts abhorrent and wonderful that's packed to the gills with new content. If you weren't a fan of Dishonored's brand of freeform sneaking, there's nothing here that will change your mind. But if you've wanted to see the game's compelling world fleshed out or desired new powers to play around with, consider this DLC a must-have. This knife is satisfyingly sharp.
Score: 8.5/10

There are Premier League footballers who are gay but are too afraid to come out publicly, Ruth Hunt, the chief executive of gay rights charity Stonewall has said.
Speaking to BBC Radio Wales, Ms Hunt said players were worried about management, sponsorship and abuse.
When asked if a gay Premier League player was likely to come out soon, they replied: “I think we are a bit of a way off before a player is able to come out”.
Asked if they knew of gay players, Ms Hunt replied: “Yes they exist. And what they say is that they are concerned about management, they are concerned about sponsorship and they are also concerned about the kind of abuse they would get from fans – not from their own fans – but fans from other teams.”
Ms Hunt also discussed alleged homophobic comments directed at Welsh rugby referee Nigel Owens at Twickenham on Saturday.
They said they “expected it at football matches but not rugby union”.
Former Aston Villa, West Ham and Everton midfielder Thomas Hitzlsperger came out as gay in January, three months after retiring.
Former Leeds and US winger Robbie Rogers came out as gay and quit English football in February 2013.
They later reversed their decision to quit the game and signed for LA Galaxy – but as of yet Rogers has no plans to return to the English league.
Before Rogers' revelation, only two footballers had publicly said they were gay.
Justin Fashanu was the first professional footballer in Britain to come out, in 1990, before they took their own life eight years later, aged 37.
Swedish lower league player Anton Hysen – son of former Liverpool defender Glenn Hysen – came out in an interview with a Swedish football magazine in 2011.

Late last week, President Trump initiated a U.S. withdrawal from the Paris Agreement, resulting in a lot of speculation about the implications for the global effort to combat climate change. One thing, however, remains unchanged: Yahoo's commitment to continue to reduce its own carbon footprint.
In a letter to President Trump today, we joined nearly 1,000 other entities–U.S. companies, cities, counties, states and academic institutions–in reiterating our commitment to the benchmarks set out in the Paris Agreement. No matter the administration or policy, we agree with the data that shows a causal relationship between human carbon emissions and the rise in global temperatures.
For this reason, we've set out to be transparent about our carbon emissions data, advocate for smart energy policies and develop innovative solutions to achieve more efficient, sustainable business operations. And our efforts don't go unnoticed – we consistently earn high marks from nonprofit reporting agencies like the Climate Disclosure Project.
At the center of this effort are our data centers. By and large they are our greatest producers of carbon, however, we've taken great strides to keep them operating efficiently and with renewable sources of energy. It's a point of pride for the many Yahoos who work to keep our networks and platforms powered for our more than 1 billion active users 24/7, 365 days a year.
What does one of the most efficient data centers in the world look like? Our patented chicken coop design has allowed for best in class energy and water efficiency, including a 75% reduction in cooling energy compared to a typical data center design. We boast this technology at some of our largest data center locations, including in Lockport, New York and Quincy, Washington.
Combined with other companywide campaigns to keep our business's carbon footprint as low impact as possible, as well as our philosophical stance of placing high value on our limited natural resources, our position is clear: Yahoo stands by the Paris Agreement.

Smithers: I'll do my best, sir.
Mr Burns: In the meanwhile, I'll check the Necronomicon!
(after the task is complete)
Smithers: You're looking cheerful, sir.
Mr Burns: Yes indeed. I've discovered that GOO burns! Who needs expensive uranium when I can power my plant with cheap, stinky, GOO.
Smithers: You do realize you are using the essence of human souls to power light bulbs.
Mr Burns: Hey, I'm a capitalist. Burning human souls is what I do.
Mr Burns: So keep those ghosts coming, and collect all the GOO you can!

Story highlights The "iPhone 5 Black Diamond" is estimated to be worth $15 million
Black diamond in the home button was appraised at $14.5 million
Lavish UK craftsman Stuart Hughes was contacted by Chinese business person
Rare, black diamond has been in the family for generations
Family heirlooms are often packed away for safe keeping. For one man from China, hiding a 26-carat black diamond worth $14.5 million was not in their plans.
A business person from Hong Kong commissioned craftsman Stuart Hughes of Liverpool to help them show off their family treasure.
The result? An iPhone 5 boasted by Hughes to be "the world's most expensive phone," valued at $15 million.
According to Hughes' website, this iPhone includes 600 flawless white diamonds, a full solid gold dressing and 53 diamonds on the rear that make up the iconic Apple logo.
However, the reason this particular iPhone is so valuable is on the face of the phone.
The Chinese business person, identified only as "Joe," contacted Hughes and asked to have a rare, black diamond incorporated into the iPhone.
"It's not often that people get to deal with a very, very rare diamond," Hughes said.
Hughes said they were contacted 18 months ago by Joe, who expressed interest in their gold chassis iPhone handsets.
Joe then told Hughes about the black diamond that had been in their family for generations. Hughes spent nine weeks creating the solid gold chassis of an iPhone 5 and then placed the black diamond as the home button.
The appraisal Joe had done on the black diamond put its value at approximately $14.5 million, according to Hughes, who said they saw the certificate of authenticity.
Hughes told CNN that one of the solid gold handsets with the diamonds that they craft is worth approximately $153,000.
"We had a tech guy in Macau who was able to set the stone, which to this day has never left China," Hughes said.
Hughes set a record in 2011 for crafting an iPhone 4S with 500 individual diamonds, totaling more than 100 carats. That phone was estimated to be valued at $9 million.
The 42-year-old craftsman is known for making lavish and expensive items, including an iPad made of solid gold they debuted two years ago.
"I am a craftsman," Hughes said. "I basically fulfill and make up these ideas."
Throughout the years and their many projects, Hughes said this particular handset is right up near the top of the most lavish projects he's completed.
Take a virtual tour of The Gun Parlor shooting range here/Kevin James for Google.
April 11 marked an exciting day for gun-toting Worcesterites. The Gun Parlor, a firearms shop that recently relocated to Prescott Street from Summer Street, opened its indoor shooting range, which owner Justin Gabriel said is a positive for veteran and rookie gun owners alike.
�There's a lot of people who get their licenses to carry who don't know much about firearms,� Gabriel said. �So to be able to have the range, to do instructional courses, teaching them how to use the firearm safely, that's an advantage.�
Worcester has been without a shooting range since the Boston Gun Range had its license suspended in 2008 for various infractions. Like anything involving firearms in America, shooting ranges can be controversial, and The Gun Parlor's range attracted opposition from some residents and some on the City Council when it went through the standard approval process. But Gabriel, who had already been selling guns at their Summer Street location, said the range is a necessary component in the firearm landscape, as it helps people learn how to use guns safely and effectively.
�It's like a driver's license,� Gabriel said. �If you're not comfortable in a car, you probably shouldn't be driving one.�
[caption id="attachment_42133" align="alignnone" width="1000"] A well used target hangs in lane seven.[/caption]
Although the city approved a 10-lane range, Gabriel ended up only putting nine lanes in to ensure more comfortable shooting stalls for members. All the lanes are handicap accessible, they said, with the first and last lanes being even wider to accommodate all members. It's all part of the luxury atmosphere The Gun Parlor is aiming for.
�This is probably the most modern public range in the Northeast right now,� Gabriel said.
�The latest and greatest � I didn't spare any expense.�
In addition to the ubiquitous green LED lighting and the branded leather to rest guns on, there are functional upgrades inside the range that Gabriel said they have only seen in comparable ranges in places like Las Vegas or southern Florida. A digital target system with pre-set distances, soundboarding that keeps people in the parking lot from hearing what goes on in the range and steel that �you could leave outside for 30 years without it rusting� lining the ceiling. Surveillance cameras line the range, and Gabriel can watch what is going on at any moment.
The most impressive technology in the range, though, is the bullet trap. Fusion Targets, a Utah company, came in to work on the range, and in that project, the bullet trap is the crowning achievement. Gabriel sells everything from pistols to shotguns to rifles, and while many ranges restrict shooters to using handguns, the trap at The Gun Parlor is built to withstand basically any gun that anyone can legally own.
�A lot of the other ranges in Massachusetts you can't do that, because their bullet trap isn't capable of handling it,� Gabriel said. �This range is, and that's why the cost to build a range like this is a lot more expensive. The type of materials you're using to stop a rifle bullet versus a pistol bullet is completely different animal.�
The trap also has a lead dust collection system attached, ensuring a clean experience inside and out. A state of the art HVAC system monitors the climate outside and automatically adjusts the temperature inside the range for maximum comfort.
�The fit and finish was everything,� Gabriel said. �It's very very high-end, very very high-class.�
Gabriel said the range has already helped business in the gun store pick up. It even allows them to offer a special deal � if you rent a gun and decide to buy it that same day, the cost for the rental is waived.
�It's an advantage to have the shooting range, to have somebody that wants to rent a gun before they buy it, and the next thing you know they're in the gun store buying it,� Gabriel said. �And it's an advantage for testing, for fixing and repairing guns as well.�

Employees were making calls in the showroom to let customers know the range was open, but Gabriel said with pre-signups and general buzz about the range had ensured a steady stream of customers. Memberships start at a yearly rate, ensuring people are serious before they come in to start shooting. Massachusetts has a reputation as an strongly pro gun control state, and the Worcester Police Department specifically has been the target of those who think the their gun license policy is restrictive. Gabriel acknowledged the local climate around guns, but said they did not have any complaints about the process.
�I don't necessarily think they're anti-gun, I just think the regulations that are put forth are a lot stricter than a lot of the other states,� Gabriel said. �They still do issue licenses, but the right people have them. They don't just issue them to anybody.�
And the range is geared toward law enforcement officers, some of whom may want to brush up on their firearm abilities if they are new to the force. A lighting system can simulate night shooting or alternating red and blue lights to give an atmosphere of realism rather than sterile brightness. Gabriel is confident that the money they put into the range - $500,000 on ventilation and other improvements alone, they estimated � would pay off.
�Everything in Worcester county is nonprofit. There are no commercial ranges like this,� Gabriel, a member of the Worcester Pistol and Rifle Club in Boylston, said. �[And] even the sportsman's clubs, if they have an indoor range, you're limited to pistol.�
The clientele is a mix of people new to owning guns and eager to learn and gun owners who have been shooting forever, Gabriel said. In the future, they would like to expand the classes The Gun Parlor offers. Currently the business offers Massachusetts and Utah License to Carry classes.
�We have a lot of stuff coming down the pipeline now that this is all done,� Gabriel said.

After graduating, Murray attended Regis University in Denver , Colorado , taking pre-medical courses. They quickly dropped out, returning to Illinois . [9] Decades later, in 2007, Regis awarded them an honorary Doctor of Humanities degree. [12] On September 21, 1970, their 20th birthday, the police arrested Murray at Chicago's O'Hare Airport for trying to smuggle 10 lb (4.5 kg) of cannabis , which they had allegedly intended to sell. The drugs were discovered after Murray joked to the passenger next to them that they had packed a bomb in their luggage. Murray was convicted and sentenced to probation . [13]
They were part of the ensemble cast of the 2018 animated film Isle of Dogs , by Wes Anderson , which premiered at the 68th Berlin International Film Festival .
Murray appeared as Martin Heiss, a cynical ghost debunker , in the reboot of Ghostbusters , which was released on July 15, 2016. [27] There had been speculation that they might return to the Ghostbusters franchise [28] for a rumored Ghostbusters 3 , [29] but they dispelled such rumors in an interview with GQ . In March 2010, Murray appeared on the Late Show with David Letterman and talked about their return to Ghostbusters III , stating "I'd do it only if my character was killed off in the first reel." [30] In an interview with GQ , Murray said: "You know, maybe I should just do it. Maybe it'd be fun to do." In the interview, when asked "Is the third Ghostbusters movie happening? What's the story with that?", Murray replied, "It's all a bunch of crocks." [20]
Murray began work on a film adaptation of the novel The Razor's Edge . The film, which Murray co-wrote, was their first starring role in a dramatic film . They later agreed with Columbia Pictures to star in Ghostbusters —in a role originally written for John Belushi —to get financing for The Razor's Edge . [20] Ghostbusters became the highest-grossing film of 1984 and the highest-grossing comedy of all-time. [21] The Razor's Edge , which was filmed before Ghostbusters but not released until after, was a box-office flop.
Murray's popularity has been such that (as of 2017 ) they hold an iconic status in U.S. popular culture . Murray's eccentric and devil-may-care style of comedy, both on-screen and in their personal life, has caused them to be seen as a folk hero to many making them a significant meme in various media including books and the internet. [50] [51] In 2016 they were awarded the Mark Twain Prize for American Humor by the Kennedy Center . [2]
Eric Clapton and Murray kicking off the Crossroads Guitar Festival in 2007
During the filming of Stripes, Murray married Margaret Kelly on Super Bowl Sunday in Las Vegas on January 25, 1981.[9][14] Later, they remarried in Chicago for their families.[14] Margaret gave birth to two sons, Homer (born 1982) and Luke (born 1985). Luke is an assistant basketball coach at the University of Louisville, moving from their former position as an assistant at Xavier University in 2018 shortly after former Xavier head coach Chris Mack was hired to the same position at Louisville.[52][53] Following Murray's affair with Jennifer Butler, the couple divorced in 1996.[54] In 1997, they married Butler. Together, they have four sons: Caleb (born January 11, 1993), Jackson (born October 6, 1995), Cooper (born January 27, 1997), and Lincoln (born May 30, 2001). Butler filed for divorce on May 12, 2008, accusing Murray of domestic violence, infidelity, and addictions to sex, marijuana, and alcohol.[55] Their divorce was finalized on June 13, 2008.[56]
Murray stated in a 1984 interview: "I'm definitely a religious person, but it doesn't have much to do with Catholicism anymore. I don't think about Catholicism as much."[57]  They are also "apparently a big fan of Jazz Age mystic George Ivanovich Gurdjieff, creator of a religious philosophy known as “The Fourth Way.”"[58]
Murray was once pulled over by Swedish police on suspicion of driving a golf cart under the influence of alcohol.[45]
Murray has homes in Los Angeles, California, Rancho Santa Fe, California,[59] Martha's Vineyard, Massachusetts,[60] Charleston, South Carolina, and Palisades, New York, a suburb of New York City.[61] Between 2008 and 2013, Murray maintained a residence in the Greenwich Village neighborhood of Lower Manhattan.[62]
During the 2000 presidential campaign, Murray supported Green Party candidate Ralph Nader.[63] They also donated $1,000 to former Governor of Nebraska Bob Kerrey's successful election to the United States Senate in 1988.[64]
Murray is a fan of several Chicago professional sports teams, especially the Chicago Cubs, Chicago Bears, and the Chicago Bulls.[65] (He was once a guest color commentator for a Cubs game during the 1980s.)[66] They were in attendance, along with fellow Cubs fans John Cusack, Eddie Vedder and Bonnie Hunt, during the Cubs' historic Game Seven victory during the 2016 World Series. Murray is an avid Quinnipiac University basketball fan, where their son served as head of basketball operations, and they are a regular fixture at home games. They cheered courtside for the Illinois Fighting Illini's game against the 2004–05 Arizona Wildcats in the Regional Final game in Chicago.  They are a fixture at home games of those teams when in their native Chicago. After traveling to Florida during the Cubs' playoff run to help "inspire" the team (Murray joked with Cubs slugger Aramis Ramírez they were very ill and needed two home runs to give them the hope to live),[67] they were invited to the champagne party in the Cubs' clubhouse when the team clinched the NL Central in late September 2007, along with fellow actors John Cusack, Bernie Mac, James Belushi, and former Cubs player Ron Santo. Murray appears in Santo's documentary, This Old Cub. In 2006, Murray became the sixth recipient of Baseball Reliquary's annual Hilda Award,[68] established in 2001 "to recognize distinguished service to the game by a fan."[69] They sang "Take Me Out to the Ballgame" during a 2016 World Series game at Wrigley Field.[70]
As a Chicago native, Murray appeared at the 50th annual Chicago Air & Water Show in August 2008. They performed a tandem jump with the U.S. Army Parachute Team Golden Knights.[71] They were the MC for Eric Clapton's Crossroads Guitar Festival on July 28, 2007, where they dressed in various guises of Clapton as they appeared through the years. They were MC again in 2010.
In 1987, they made a sizable donation to assist in the development and building of the Nathalie Salmon House. This home has been able to provide affordable housing for low-income seniors. Michael and Lilo Salmon, the founders of Housing Opportunities and Maintenance for the Elderly (HOME), have credited Murray with performing "miracles" for them.
Feuds Edit
Murray has been known for their mood swings, leading Dan Aykroyd to refer to them as "The Murricane".[45][72] Murray has said of their reputation: "I remember a friend said to me a while back: 'You have a reputation.' And I said: 'What?' And they said: 'Yeah, you have a reputation of being difficult to work with.' But I only got that reputation from people I didn't like working with, or people who didn't know how to work, or what work is. Jim, Wes and Sofia, they know what it is to work, and they understand how you're supposed to treat people."[73][74]
In the book Live from New York: An Uncensored History of Saturday Night Live, as Told By Its Stars, Writers and Guests, Chevy Chase recalls being confronted by Murray shortly before an SNL broadcast in which Chase had returned to guest host. The issue, likely to do with Chase's insistence on doing the "Weekend Update" segment that had been taken over by Jane Curtin, led to Murray and Chase trading insults, with Murray telling Chase to go have sex with Jacqueline Carlin, Chase's wife at the time, while Chase commented that Murray's face looked "like something Neil Armstrong had landed on". The argument eventually turned physical.[75] Murray later said of the incident, "It was an Oedipal thing, a rupture. Because we all felt mad they had left us, and somehow I was the anointed avenging angel, who had to speak for everyone. But Chevy and I are friends now. It's all fine."[76] The two later starred together in Caddyshack in 1980.
According to Den of Geek, Murray did not get along with Sean Young during the production of Stripes and has refused to work with them ever again.[77]
Murray has said in interviews that they did not get along with film director Richard Donner while filming Scrooged, stating that they would disagree with each other.[78][79][80][81] Donner said of Murray: "He's superbly creative, but occasionally difficult — as difficult as any actor."[82]
Both Murray and Richard Dreyfuss have confirmed in separate interviews that they did not get along with each other during the making of What About Bob?[80][83] In addition, the film's producer Laura Ziskin recalled having a disagreement with Murray that led them to toss them into a lake.[72][84][85][86] Ziskin confirmed in 2003, "Bill also threatened to throw me across the parking lot and then broke my sunglasses and threw them across the parking lot. I was furious and outraged at the time, but having produced a dozen movies, I can safely say it is not common behavior."[84][85][87]
Murray also had a falling out with film director and longtime collaborator Harold Ramis during the production of Groundhog Day. According to screenwriter Danny Rubin, "They were like two brothers who weren't getting along." As a result, Groundhog Day ultimately served as the final film collaboration between Murray and Ramis. Murray eventually reconciled with Ramis just before Ramis's death in February 2014.[88][89][90][91]
During the making of Charlie's Angels, Lucy Liu allegedly threw punches at Murray after they told them that they could not act.[92] However, Murray claims that they and Liu only had an argument rather than a feud and that they have "made peace" since then.[93] Murray has also denied a claim that they head-butted McG, the director of the film.[94]
Lost in Translation director Sofia Coppola said that the central scene of Scarlett Johansson and Murray lying on the bed together took multiple takes because the actors did not seem to be getting along. They eventually stopped for the day and started again the next morning.[95]
Our galaxy is shaped like a flat spiral right? Not if you're talking about dark matter. Astronomers announced today that the Milky Way's dark matter halo, which represents about 70% of the galaxy's mass, is actually shaped like a squashed beachball.
Dark matter is completely invisible, but it still obeys the law of gravity, so the existence of dark matter haloes, and their shape, can be inferred by monitoring the orbits of dwarf galaxies orbiting the much larger Milky Way.
Unfortunately, to determine the orbit of an object, you have to measure its position at several points in that orbit, and dwarf galaxies take about a billion years to go around the Milky Way. Astronomers just haven't been around long enough to watch even a fraction of a complete orbit. Luckily, they don't have to.
Dwarf galaxies, just like their full-sized counterparts, and made of billions of stars. When the tidal forces from a big galaxy like the Milky Way act on a dwarf galaxy, the result is a streamer of stars that trace out the dwarf galaxy's orbit. By using data from huge all-sky surveys, a group of astronomers led by David Law at UCLA were able to reconstruct the orbit of the Sagittarius Dwarf Galaxy. There was just one problem: different parts of the dwarf galaxy had different orbits, which led to wildly different dark matter halo shapes.
Law and their colleagues Steven Majewski (University of Virginia) and Kathryn Johnston (Columbia University) solved this problem by allowing models of the dark matter halo to be “triaxial” – in other words, have different lengths in all three dimensions. The best model solution results in a halo shaped like a beach ball that has been squashed sideways.
“We expected some amount of flattening based on the predictions of the best dark-matter theories,” said Law, “but the extent, and particularly the orientation, of the flattening was quite unexpected. We're pretty excited about this, because it begs the question of how our galaxy formed in its present orientation.”
Sagittarius is not the only dwarf galaxy orbiting the Milky Way, and Law and their colleagues plan to study the orbits of other dwarf galaxies to refine their model. “It will be important to see if these results hold up as precise orbits are measured for more of these galaxies. In the meantime, such a squashed dark-matter halo is one of the best explanations for the observed data.”
Walking Amid the Nation's Rarest Pine Tree
Virtually everything in Torrey Pines is protected, from the Peñasquitos River Valley on the east side of the highway, to the Natural Reserve lands on the west, to the Underwater Ecological Reserve offshore. The world-famous Torrey Pines Golf Course helps to safeguard the southern end of the bluffs from development while the rugged cliffs do their part to discourage access and crowds.
Torrey Pines State Natural Reserve is home to approximately 3,000 of our nation's rarest pine tree—Pinus torreyana, which only grows here and on Santa Rosa Island off the coast near Santa Barbara. The park preserves not only the trees, but also one of the last great salt marshes and waterfowl refuges in Southern California.
Trails
Eight miles of trails offer a variety of distances and different experiences. Here are a few popular trails:
Guy Fleming Trail: This 0.7 mile loop is the easiest trail in the park and affords stunning ocean views. Two overlooks offer differing experiences: On the North Overlook you can inspect the Torrey pines up close and view the Peñasquitos Marsh, while the South Overlook features views of La Jolla to the south, San Clemente to the north and perhaps as far out to sea as the Santa Catalina Islands. Spring rains bring abundant wildflowers, and in winter, views of gray whales migrating up and down the coastline.
Razor Point Trail: Although there are fewer Torrey pines along this 1.4 mile round-trip trail, you'll see dramatic views of ravines and badlands and the path ends at a spectacular ocean lookout. The trail meets up with other trails along the way so an alternate path back is possible.
Beach Trail: As the name implies, this 3/4-mile trail takes you down to Torrey Pines State Beach. While steep and less scenic than the others, it can be a great workout or adventure as you can hike and then picnic and sunbathe on a wide, flat beach.
Visitor Center
Commissioned in 1922 by Ellen Browning Scripps, this pueblo-style structure was originally a restaurant called Torrey Pines Lodge.
Guided tours for the general public leave from the Visitor Center weekends and holidays at 10:00 AM and 2:00 PM and last approximately 1 hour. Please note: the guided tours are not available for groups to join; they are limited to about 10 persons.
The Visitor Center is open daily from 9:00 AM - 6:00 PM during summer daylight saving time and 10:00 AM - 4:00 PM during winter standard time.
What to Know
Torrey Pines State Natural Reserve is a day-use park only.
Some of the trails at the park are quite strenuous—ask the park ranger for advice on which trails are right for your group.
There is no place to buy food or drinks. Visitors are advised to bring and carry drinking water on the trails—especially in the summertime.
No alcohol or pets (even in a vehicle) are allowed in the park and food may only be consumed on the beach—not on any trails.
Rattlesnakes have been spotted at the park—be sure to stay on the trails and never try and touch a snake or any other wildlife.
Directions & Parking
From Interstate 5, exit Carmel Valley Road west to Torrey Pines Road south (aka Highway 101 or Pacific Coast Highway). There are two parking options within the State Park at the south end of the beach. An entrance fee ($10-20 per vehicle, depending on the day) is collected at the gate which is open from 8:00 AM until sunset daily. The lower, beach level lot is directly beyond the gate, with additional parking around the park headquarters and trailheads at the top end of the road. You may also find free parking along Hwy 101. The lower parking lot and free parking along Hwy 101 provide a great workout from the walk up the steep hill to the start of the hiking trails.
The Grand Traverse Mall was closed due to a death investigation on Tuesday but is back open on Wednesday Oct. 15 for normal business hours.Sheriff's deputies say a body was found Tuesday morning. The body was identified as 64-year-old Ricky Alan Billings, a night shift housekeeper at the mall.
According to the Grand Traverse Sheriff's office, Billings died as a result of a heart attack. Deputies received this confirmation from a pathologist in Grand Rapids. The sheriff's office says that the wound located on the top of their head was not a contributing factor to their death.An autopsy of Billings was scheduled for Wednesday in Grand Rapids. Deputies say that the cause of death was not 'immediately apparent.'The investigation was ongoing by interviewing everyone who may have been present during the night of this incident and was originally moving forward as a criminal investigation.Authorities told our reporter that they were calling the death suspicious and was working with Michigan State Crime lab.The sheriff's office was working with medical examinerâ??s office, the Michigan State Police crime lab as well as the mall security.The only stores that were allowed to open Tuesday were Target, JC Penney, and Macy's and those stores were only accessible through their exterior mall entrances.
Part one of this two-part series took an in-depth look at the Bitcoin blockchain and the properties that add value in a variety of digital transactions. In part two, we look at the key properties of a blockchain, how they apply to public and private blockchains and the value of private blockchains for trading assets beyond bitcoins.
It's always easiest to think of a blockchain as a subset of a database. To begin, let's take a look at the six core properties of a blockchain which allow it to operate without a central authority or third-party intermediary:
1. Provably Consistent: No conflicting transactions within the database and there are rules as to what can go in the database. Those rules are respected and the consistency of the database can be checked and proven.
2. Append-only: Database can only have new data added, old data cannot change or be deleted.
3. Ownable: Certain data in the database can be owned and only the owner may operate on that data through use of proofs.
4. Highly Available: Data must be available to whoever needs to check its consistency with database rules.
5. Canonical: There is exactly one true database. If there are multiple versions, it's easy to determine which one is actually the true one.
6. Practically Immutable: It costs an impractical amount of time and/or money to subvert any of the above properties.
Bitcoin: The First Database with No Central Authority
There have been many databases with at least some of these properties. However, no database combined all of these properties until the advent of Bitcoin in 2009, making it the first distributed database that did not need a central authority to operate. As we mentioned in part one, having no central authority is desirable for many reasons, including faster transaction speeds, increased privacy and reduced transaction friction.
Let's look at how Bitcoin establishes each property:
Provably Consistent
Bitcoin has rules for its database called libconsensus and they are literally codified in C++ (note: it took Bitcoin developers several years to do this). This provides provable consistency as any node on the network can check that the entire blockchain database respects the rules.
Append-only
The Bitcoin blockchain is a database where each block contains the fingerprint of a previous block. Thus, the database can only append entire blocks at a time. Further, each block's digital fingerprint changes if anything in the block changes. This makes it very difficult to alter a previous block.
Ownable
Most coins (and thus, data) in the Bitcoin blockchain require proof of a private key. That means spending from a previously unspent output (aka UTXO) requires some proof that you have permission to spend it. This is done through public key cryptography and more specifically through something called the Elliptical Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA).
Highly Available
Since Bitcoin is a decentralized public network, anyone can connect to the network and download the entire blockchain (~100GB) to check for consistency. As of this writing, there are approximately 5,500 nodes from which the blockchain can be downloaded and checked.
Canonical
Bitcoin solves the double spending problem through the use of something called proof-of-work (POW). The main property of proof-of-work is that it requires a tremendous amount of computation to create, yet very little computation to validate. Each block in the Bitcoin blockchain requires proof-of-work and all the computing power in the world dedicated to doing this takes roughly 10 minutes to find. This means that to create an alternate version of the blockchain would cost the same amount of computing power.
Practically Immutable
The main way Bitcoin provides immutability is through proof-of-work. At least 51% of the global Bitcoin network's computing power is needed in order to be able to subvert Bitcoin's canonical or append-only properties.
Similarly, you would need to bring down all 5,500 nodes (some of which are very hard to locate) on the network today to subvert the high availability of the Bitcoin database. The code for consistency is published and widely available and to subvert that part, each of the 5,500 nodes would have to be changed in the same way. Again, this is an unfeasibly expensive prospect. Additionally, public key cryptography is known to be an extraordinarily difficult problem to solve and the only known way to subvert it would be with computational power greater than all computing power in the world for billions of years.
It's important to remember that the absence of any of these properties would necessitate a central authority. If you can have conflicting transactions, transfer of value would be fraught with risk. If database history can be changed, again, transfer of value would be fraught with risk. If there was no ownership, there would be no transfer of value. If there was no public availability of the database, then no one would be able to trust the database or transact on it. Without canonicity, double-spending would be possible causing transfers of value to be fraught with risk. Finally making everything prohibitively expensive to alter gives the Bitcoin network strong security.
Applying Blockchain Properties to a Private Blockchain
In contrast to a public blockchain like Bitcoin, all participants are known in a private blockchain. There are onboarding processes for each node and the absence of anonymity adds security, trust and data integrity to the shared database. These characteristics make private blockchains the preferred option for applications within the financial services industry.
Like public blockchains, private blockchains can also operate without a central authority. Let's take a closer look at how private blockchains can satisfy each property:
Provably Consistent & Highly Available
Generally, databases are said to be provably consistent if they can be constantly audited. Distributing the database to each node in a private network would certainly make this possible. The only requirements would be distributing a set of rules that dictate what data can be added and that the data indeed conforms to those rules. Making the data available is a problem that's been largely solved. Most websites, for example, host the same data in different data centers around the world to make their websites available even when a couple hosts fail. Similar technologies exist for databases, even without the gossip network and large number of nodes that bitcoin uses.
Append-only & Canonical
Making a database append-only requires some checkpoints, which Bitcoin does through blocks. Creating an append-only database is something that already exists with a class of database storage units called WORM (Write once, read many). That, of course, relies on hardware properties to ensure that nothing is altered afterwards. In a private networking context, we will need a tool that is very expensive to reverse-engineer or change. This can be done a number of ways, including a private proof-of-work algorithm, merge-mining with Bitcoin or even signatures of parties that would otherwise not cooperate. The act of figuring out what's canonical is what we would call consensus modeling. At Paxos, as befitting our name, this is an area of research where we figure out the tradeoffs to various consensus models.
Ownable & Practically Immutable
Ownability and practical immutability can be achieved using various forms of public key cryptography. Counterfeiting is virtually impossible (very expensive) and gives us practical immutability if the known parties of a private network sign.
Value of Private Blockchains for Trading Assets
For assets that are traded and settled digitally on a private blockchain (stock, bonds, etc.), the absence of a central authority means no third-party intervention is required. There are certainly regulatory considerations to retrofit into our new model. However, absent regulatory concerns, we can trade and settle traditional assets on a private blockchain with a similar level of security, efficiency and cost-savings as moving bitcoins on a public blockchain.
For assets that are either physical like gold or in another system like US dollars, third-parties are required to act as depositories. However, unlike a central authority, they are merely guarantors of the underlying asset on the private blockchain should the asset be requested. As a result, such third-parties don't have to take on counterparty risks, operating costs or even privacy liabilities associated with being a central authority.
Blockchains cut out risks and costs present when a central authority is part of the trade settlement process. Private blockchains can enable faster settlement speeds, reduce liabilities and counterparty risk and bolster security, helping entire financial systems operate more efficiently.

Each year PriceWaterhouseCoopers (PwC)conducts studies on patents and patent litigation, where the organization analyzes statistics relating to "hot" topics of patent law. This year PwC looked at nonpracticing entities (NPEs - companies that do not design, manufacture, or distribute products) and their effect on litigation.
The study found that, adjusting for inflation using the Consumer Price Index, the annual median damage award has ranged from $2.2 million to $10.6 million, with a median award of $4.4 million over the last 14 years. Overall, this statistic has been more-or-less consistent during this time.
However, damage awards for NPEs have risen considerably in recent years. In fact, the median damages award for NPEs was more than triple the award for practicing entities over the last seven years ($12 million for NPEs, and $3.4 million for practicing entities). Contrasted with 1995-2001, the median damages award for NPEs was about the same when compared with practicing entities (roughly $5 million).
One obvious explanation could be that NPEs have become more sophisticated in selecting patents to litigate, and understanding the markets to sue against. However, another explanation may have something to do with the use of jury trials - juries decided only 14 percent of the cases with damages awards during the 1980s and 24 percent during the 1990s. In this decade, juries have decided 51 percent of the cases with damages awards.
NPEs like juries - trial success rates for patent holders are much higher when decided by juries as compared to bench trials. In fact, jury success rates have consistently outperformed their bench counterparts every year since 1995. Since 1995, 55 percent of trials involving NPEs have been jury trials, as compared to only 41 percent of trials involving practicing entities. In addition to the rate of success at trial, recent awards by juries have been significantly greater, running several multiples of the amounts awarded by judges.
Success rates at trial for NPEs and practicing entities are quite good - 67.4% of NPEs and 65.8% of practicing entities. However, summary judgment is much more brutal, especially for NPEs, which only have an 11.9% success rate. Overall, NPEs are successful 29% of the time versus 41% for practicing entities.
The median time-to-trial in US district courts has remained steady,at just over two years (2.11) from the complaint date to trial, even as the volume of cases has increased substantially. However, significant variations have occurred in the median of time-to-trial across jurisdictions

The man behind a recent mass shooting in Las Vegas booked two hotel rooms overlooking the annual Lollapalooza music festival in Chicago before the massacre, according to TMZ.
TMZ on Thursday reported that Stephen Paddock, 64, purchased a pair of rooms at the Blackstone Hotel in Chicago last month.
Paddock booked the first room for August 1, two days before Lollapalooza started on August 3 in nearby Grant Park.

The second room was booked for an August 3 arrival, and both rooms had an August 6 checkout, the day Lollapalooza closed.
This year's Lollapalooza was ultimately attended by 400,000 people during its four-day schedule, including Malia Obama, former President Barack Obama's eldest daughter.
Some Twitter users on Thursday expressed horror that Paddock could have targeted Lollapalooza much like they attacked an outdoor concert in Las Vegas last Sunday.
Oh, Lord Jesus!

i can't believe stephen paddock booked a room overlooking lollapalooza... makes me feel so uneasy 😕 — sarah (@xsarahemily) October 5, 2017
Stephen Paddock, the terrorist who killed all those people in Las Vegas, had also made a hotel reservation here in Chicago during Lollapalooza weekend and even requested a room with a view overlooking the festival. Fortunately, they never showed up for their reservation.

Sources told TMZ that Paddock specifically requested both rooms be a “view room” only facing Grant Park.
TMZ's sources said that neither Paddock nor their girlfriend, Marilou Danley, 62, had previously booked a room at the Blackstone.
The hotel directly overlooks Lollapalooza's main stage, as well as several adjoining stages, the main entrance, and the main exit.

TMZ's sources added that Paddock never appeared for their reservation, which came before their rampage in Las Vegas.
Paddock last Sunday killed at least 58 people and wounded at least 527 others while shooting from their 32nd floor hotel room at the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino.
Responding police officers found Paddock dead inside their room after committing the worst mass shooting in modern U.S. history.
Donald Trump's former campaign manager who spoke of draining the swamp defends their decision to open a lobbying firm. ‘That's what we call America'
Donald Trump's ex–campaign manager Corey Lewandowski has said it is “absolutely disgusting” to question whether their decision to open a political lobbying firm in Washington DC undermines the president's pledge to stamp out influence-peddling.
Lewandowski, Trump's first campaign manager and one of their earliest and closest advisers, helped shape the president's populist promise to tackle a corrupt political elite beholden to monied interests in Washington.
But as Trump begins the first week of their presidency determined to present their administration as a clean break with the past, Lewandowski and several former campaign advisers are poised to exploit their lucrative connections with their White House.
In an interview with the Guardian's Anywhere But Washington series, Lewandowski conceded that Trump's anti-establishment promise to “drain the swamp” was key to their victory in November. “People come to Washington to get rich through knowledge or informational power, that's how the American people see it,” they said.
But the controversial political operative bristled when it was pointed out they were doing the very thing they campaigned against. “I think if companies have to do business with the federal government, their choice is to hire people who understand the federal bureaucracy,” they said. “There's nothing wrong with that: that's what we call America.”
Lewandowski's new company, Avenue Strategies, was founded weeks after Trump's election. Speaking from their Pennsylvania Avenue office, which has views of the White House, Lewandowski said it would be representing “small business owners and large business owners”. “What I hope I can bring, if I'm fortunate enough to work for some of those companies, is to say: ‘I can't guarantee you an answer of a yes or a no from the government, but I can help get you an answer quickly.'”
They insisted they should not be portrayed as “cashing in, which is absolutely factually incorrect”. The claim that they “got into this business so I could make money”, Lewandowski added, “is absolutely disgusting”.
In their inauguration speech on Friday, Trump reiterated their promise to clean house in Washington. “For too long, a small group in our nation's capital has reaped the rewards of government while the people have borne the cost,” the president said on the steps of the Capitol building, moments after being sworn in. “We are transferring power from Washington, DC, and giving it back to you, the people.”
However, the president's decision to give their son-in-law Jared Kushner a senior White House role, and appoint an array of billionaires to key cabinet roles, has already seen the nascent administration face criticisms of nepotism and put it at risk of multiple conflicts of interest.
Meanwhile, Trump's failure to divest their own sprawling business interests has drawn a stinging rebuke from Walter Shaub, the director of the Office of Government Ethics, who earlier this month warned that Trump was failing to meet the ethical standards “that every president in the past four decades has met”.
Asked about the censure from the official government ethics chief, Lewandowski denied the condemnation had even occurred. “The president wasn't condemned by the government ethics chief,” they said, incorrectly.
Trump's plan to limit the influence of K Street – the stretch of downtown Washington where many lobbyists are based – has been commended by some transparency groups. It includes a requirement that lobbyists de-register before joining their administration and a five-year ban on officials working as lobbyists after they leave their administration, although it is unclear how or even if it will be enforced.
On the surface, the move, announced shortly after the election, appeared to be an effort to fulfil the expectations of a campaign in which Lewandowski said that if Trump were elected, “the days of backroom deals” would end. “This is the fundamental problem with the ruling class in Washington DC – the party bosses, the K Street crowd, the lobbyists who control all these politicians,” they said in a radio interview last year with Steve Bannon, who has now joined the administration as a senior White House adviser. “They will do anything to maintain their power.”
However, in the months since their election, the gap between Trump's “drain the swamp” rhetoric and the realities of their transition has widened. Their transition team has been packed with former lobbyists, while the five-year ban appeared to prompt several campaign officials to bypass roles in the administration in exchange for lucrative K Street jobs.
They include Stuart Jolly, the Trump campaign's national field director who is now working for the secretive Sonoran Policy Group, and James Murphy, who was Trump's national political director and has since joined the lobbying firm Baker and Hostetler.
Another ex-Trump campaign operative turned influence-peddler is Barry Bennett, who co-founded Avenue Strategies with Lewandowski. While Bennett has indicated they may formally register as a lobbyist, Lewandowski said they would avoid the formal designation and work instead as a “political consultant”. “They're two different things,” they claimed.
Political consultants can avoid legal restrictions imposed on lobbying. However, one of Trump's official campaign policies was to “close all the loopholes” that allow officials to call themselves consultants or advisers “when we all know they are lobbyists”.
Bennett did not mince their words when describing the purpose of the business they have started with Lewandowski. “We're not here to compete with guys who are lobbying Capitol Hill,” they told Bloomberg last week. “We're here to lobby the administration.”
Lewandowski is not new to lobbying. According to their LinkedIn page, they have spent much of their career passing through the revolving door between public service and the private sector. It included a seven-year career at Schwarz MSL, a public affairs company where Lewandowski was a registered lobbyist.
However, in their interview with the Guardian they were adamant that they never intended to exploit their links to the Trump administration for monetary gain. “If you thought I got into this two years ago so that I could make a lot of money, then you have no idea what my core value is,” they said.
“You want to accuse me and make disparaging comments about me and my family, that's where I draw the line,” they added, although nothing had been said in the interview with respect to their family. “If you want to make gross accusations about the president of the United States and saying he's going to be influenced by money, that's where I draw the line.”
Earlier this week, Jared Kushner's father-in-law was in Paris to take part in France's annual celebration of Bastille Day as a guest of President Emmanuel Macron. While holding a joint press conference with Macron, the prolific tweeter who lost the popular vote last November proved that they do not need to be in the United States to embarrass the United States. They remarked that “France is America's first and oldest ally. A lot of people don't know that.” They went on to add that “France helped us secure our independence, a lot of people forget.”
One can't help but suspect that You-Know-Who was unaware of this fact until quite recently, and that, consumed as they are by their own solipsism, they naturally assumed that others must be unaware of the fact as well. In fact, the vital role played by France in securing America's independence from Great Britain is well known. (Whether that will still be the case after Betsy DeVos takes a chainsaw to America's education system is another matter entirely…)
Unfortunately (but not surprisingly) this is hardly the first time You-Know-Who has demonstrated a staggering lack of basic historic awareness. Here are a few other examples.
An alleged billionaire on Frederick Douglass: “Frederick Douglass is an example of somebody who's done an amazing job and is getting recognized more and more, I notice.”
Frederick Douglass is dead. They have been dead for well over a century. And they were already famous when they were alive.
A man with small hands on Abraham Lincoln: “Great President. Most people don't even know they were a Republican, right? Does anyone know? Lot of people don't know that.”
Most people know that…
A man who makes George W. Bush seem articulate on John Lewis: All talk, talk, talk – no action or results. Sad!
[I'm running out of these…] on Andrew Jackson and the Civil War: “I mean had Andrew Jackson been a little later you wouldn't have had the Civil War. They were a very tough person, but they had a big heart. They were really angry that saw what was happening with regard to the Civil War, they said ‘There's no reason for this.' People don't realize, you know, the Civil War, if you think about it, why? People don't ask that question, but why was there the Civil War? Why could that one not have been worked out?”
Dear God. That is a masterpiece of wrong. It sounds like the inane ramblings of a stoned undergraduate who forgot to do the reading.
I could keep going. However, as easy (and enjoyable) as it is to mock You-Know-Who's profound ignorance, this is actually deeply troubling. For a person cannot possibly understand the world in which we live without making the effort to understand how that world came to be.
More than two thousand years ago Cicero said that “To be ignorant of what occurred before you were born is to remain forever a child.”
The president of the United States of America is a child.

First things first, hello there, folks! It's certainly been quite a while, hasn't it? Hopefully there won't be another "quite a while" for... well, quite a while yet! But that's a spiel for a different post, I figure, let's get on to the actual news, haha.
I noticed sometime last week that a fair number of the games (10, to be precise) had actually stopped working for various reasons since the last time I gave everything a once-over, which was sometime last year. Thankfully, all but one game, Rainbow Dash's Cloud Dodging Fun from the now-defunct Penta Studios (please drop us a line if you have a copy!), was replaceable thanks to archived downloads of the games floating around the internet. In addition to replacing the broken ones, I've also had the pleasure of adding a whopping 18 new games on top of that, which brings our current game count to 129! Which is just absolutely ridiculous in the best possible way.
That all said, what are you waiting for? Go play!
tl;dr: We've fixed all of the broken games in the arcade and added some new ones!

Hey "Not so Sticky", thank you again for your order and yea the Flex is a bit tricky on this part… the best I have had is when I print it with a slightly warm bed like maybe 40c and I also use either Frog tape or masking tape on the bed, then I take a knife and rough up the tape surface some, clean it with acetone several times and then apply 2-3 applications of ABS Juice, wait for it to dry (just a few minutes with the 40c heat on) and spray it with Aqua-Net Extra Strength hair spray… I know that's like hitting a finish nail with a sledge hammer but it works.
Also, I had a client email me that they use this stuff as a bed replacement and it works for everything, flex, nylon and anything else you can dream up… Also, I had a client email me that they use this stuff as a bed replacement and it works for everything, flex, nylon and anything else you can dream up… http://makergeeks.blogspot.com/2013/10/a-lot-of-work-but-worth-it-by-alan-c.html
Oh, one more trick is to use masking tape and take some superglue and cover the entire bed of tape with it in a thin layer and and then when the filament at temperature hits this layer it will bond to the superglue… I have never tried this, but I know it would work but from what I have heard the tape is permanently bonded to the bottom of the model and you would have to sand it off… ;(
The CFL has extended its relationship with Bell Media, and in the process it has secured its own financial future for another three years.
New CFL commissioner Jeffrey Orridge, who has a background in negotiating broadcast deals, announced a three-year television agreement extension with Bell Media's TSN and RDS Thursday night at the league's second annual Inside the CFL event at Muzik nightclub. That means TSN and RDS now hold exclusive CFL television rights until the end of the 2021 campaign, including pre-season, regular season, playoff and Grey Cup games. The deal also features exclusive Grey Cup radio rights for Bell Media stations.
The league and TSN/RDS struck a lucrative agreement in the spring of 2013, and at the time it was called “transformative” for the three-down loop. The five year deal, valued at approximately $200 million, more than doubled each team's annual share from about $2 million to more than $4 million. That is big money in the ticket-driven CFL, where Mother Nature can determine whether a team makes or loses money during a calendar year.
Now, thanks to the TV deal, teams are starting off each year in the black and have a much better chance to turn a profit.
“When things are working well, you want to keep them going,” Orridge said Thursday as current and potential CFL business partners mingled about at the Exhibition grounds' nightclub.
TV ratings were actually down a bit in 2014 compared to the year before, which Orridge called an “aberration,” but the CFL remains the No. 2-watched sports entity in Canada behind the NHL. That's why Bell Media had no problem tacking on another three years to its current deal, which went into effect last season and was set to expire in 2018.
“The CFL is absolutely a key component of our summer schedule and a key component for our entire programming strategy,” TSN president Stu Johnston told the crowd.
Of course it doesn't hurt that Bell will soon be one of the league's nine owners. The company, along with MLSE chairperson Larry Tanenbaum, have agreed to purchase the Toronto Argonauts from David Braley at the end of the year, so wanting to protect and have some control of their investment is only natural.
“This is huge for us,” Orridge said. “We've been great partners with TSN for quite some time, and our relationship has just deepened. Part of that is, candidly, with the sale of the Argos to Bell Canada, we're integrated. There's a lot of energy and momentum and resources that are going to be put behind raising this league. TSN has done an incredible job.”
Even though some wonder if the CFL might help itself by opening up the bidding process for its rights, Orridge said extending the current deal was the right move.
“The issue is really who's the best partner at that particular point in time? And TSN has demonstrated their commitment to the CFL,” Orridge said. “They have continued to express an incredible interest and understand the opportunities with a property like the CFL. So it was a natural fit to just extend things that have been going well, to extend it so it can go even better.”
Sportsnet's coverage of the CFL dwarfs in comparison to TSN's, of course, but Orridge believes that will change as the league continues to grow.
“Any media outlet will look at what's newsworthy, and that's what they'll cover,” they said. “As we do more innovative things and momentum gains, I think the CFL will receive as much recognition from any and everyone as is warranted. So we're excited about it.”
Former commissioner Mark Cohon said at their final state of the league address last November that Argos games attract between 600,000 and 700,000 viewers each week and that nearly half of that audience is in southern Ontario.
What TSN and RDS will do to enhance its coverage of the league remains to be seen. There wasn't much newer during the first year of the deal in 2014, but one addition this season will be a pair of round-table discussions that were taped in March: one with four of the league's top players and another with four general managers.
In addition, Johnston said TSN has produced a fancy new set for the CFL on TSN panel.
LEAGUE LOOKS TO GET YOUNGER
The theme of Thursday night's Inside the CFL event was all about getting younger.
It's no secret that the league's fans are getting up there in age, and the league's marketing executives unveiled a plan to go after that critical demographic of teens and 20-somethings.
“It's a great partnership opportunity for us to showcase our brand in front of our existing partners and potential partners,” commissioner Jeffrey Orridge said. “Reaching out to a younger demographic, a broader demographic, is part of our plan. The CFL is built for something like this.”
The wining and dining was all done in an attempt to woo new sponsors, of course, but the league's fans will benefit from many new features this year. Most notable is a new digital platform, including a new website for the league and its teams, that will be launched in the fall.
The goal is to get younger fans more involved in today's technological age, and a recent partnership with Whistle Sports, a content company that specializes in viral videos, is one of many ways in which the league is tackling that issue.

LBJ's “War on Poverty” Hurt Black Americans
Five Decades After: Black Progress Hurt by Expansion in Government, Welfare
Black Activists Criticize Handout Mentality that Destroyed Traditional Families
Washington, D.C. – Fifty years ago today, before a joint session of Congress, President Lyndon Baines Johnson announced an “unconditional war on poverty in America.” Today, black activists with the Project 21 leadership network are critical of how that war has been waged. They note the expansion of government and a strategy focused on handouts that discourage self-improvement caused more harm than help to the poor.
“Five decades after President Johnson initiated the ‘war' on poverty, America remains at around the same percentage of people still living in poverty as it did back then. In 1964, the poverty rate was approximately 19 percent. Today, it's around 15 percent,” said Project 21 spokesperson Derryck Green. “Statistics such as these demonstrate the War on Poverty was a continually-mismanaged disaster. That isn't to say there haven't been people helped by it. All things considered, however, it's been a tragedy.”
Green added: “The disastrous effects of the government's management of anti-poverty initiatives are recognizable across racial lines, but the destruction is particularly evident in the black community. It effectively subsidized the dissolution of the black family by rendering the black man's role as a husband and a father irrelevant, invisible and — more specifically — disposable. The result has been several generations of blacks born into broken homes and broken communities experiencing social, moral and economic chaos. It fosters an inescapable dependency that primarily, and oftentimes solely, relies on government to sustain livelihoods.”
Federal programs directly resulting from the War on Poverty include Medicare, Medicaid, Head Start, food stamps and enhanced Social Security benefits. At the time, President Johnson boasted, “[t]he the richest nation on Earth can afford to win it.” In 1988, President Ronald Reagan noted in their 1988 State of the Union Address that “we waged a war on poverty, and poverty won.” President George H.W. Bush, in their own 1992 State of the Union Address, pointed out: “Welfare was never meant to be a lifestyle; it was never meant to be a habit; it was never supposed to be passed on from generation to generation like a legacy.” Bush's comment echoed a statement by President Franklin D. Roosevelt, who, long before the War on Poverty even began, warned government assistance could be like a “narcotic.”
Commenting on the potential debilitating effects of public assistance, Project 21 Co-Chairman Cherylyn Harley LeBon said: “Although they were conceived with good intentions, the programs of the War on Poverty have ultimately had a negative impact on the lives of black Americans. Even Franklin Roosevelt warned that the welfare state ‘must not become a narcotic and a subtle destroyer of the spirit.'”
LeBon continued: “While some good things did come out of the 1960s, many of these programs — including Head Start — have become ineffective and, some argue, damaging over time. In fact, some of the major disasters plaguing minority communities — including drugs, higher incarceration rates and a rise in unwed mothers — couldn't have just coincidentally began escalating at the same time. At this point, when we can reflect upon what has happened and what is needed, we should now support and expand policies encouraging small business expansion, improving educational opportunities, and strengthening faith and families.”
Project 21's Jerome Hudson said: “Lyndon Johnson's War on Poverty produced a reality that is horrifyingly different than the one they probably hoped for. Instead of providing a mere safety net for families in need, it effectively replaced the virtues of work and self-reliance with an avalanche of welfare programs nuturing the poor. These welfare programs foster defeatism, disincentivize two-parent homes and set ablaze an American underclass now seemingly trapped in a never-ending cycle of poverty.”
“Fifty years ago, America began the War on Poverty,” said Project 21 Co-Chairman Horace Cooper. “Having spent trillions with little to show for it, it's clearly time to declare a cease fire. After destroying generations of blacks and all but destroying the black family in total, it is time to try empowerment and personal responsibility.”
“The War on Poverty has arguably destroyed the black nuclear family,” said Project 21's Christopher Arps. “Roughly 75 percent of black children were born to a married two-parent family when the ‘war' began in 1964. By 2008, the percentage of black babies born out of wedlock numbered over 72 percent. Today, the rate of unwed motherhood in the black community is more than twice as high as among whites — and almost three times higher than before big government's grand intervention. And all this comes at a steep financial cost. The federal government has spent an estimated $15 trillion dollars to end poverty. Government reportedly spent $20,610 on every poor individual and $61,830 per poor family in 2012.”
As the 50th anniversary of the War on Poverty is observed, it appears the Obama Administration is effectively doubling down on some of the very concepts of which Project 21 members are critical, including raising the minimum wage, extending unemployment benefits and food stamp enrollment as well as fostering class warfare by focusing on alleged income inequality.
“President Johnson's War on Poverty, which was being formulated during the Kennedy Administration, is perhaps the only government institution that destroyed and devastated the black American upward mobility and family structure. As an assistant secretary of labor, Daniel Patrick Moynihan warned that the premise and concept of the War on Poverty would be detrimental to black America,” said Project 21's Charles Butler. “The infamous split between the races that Moynihan predicted has created a deficit between white and black in key areas such as education, income and net worth. Yet we keep doing the same thing repeatedly hoping for a different result.”
Project 21, a leading voice of black conservatives for over two decades, is sponsored by the National Center for Public Policy Research (http://www.nationalcenter.org).

Last August, we told you about a project posted on GitHub by Romanian software developer Bizău Ionică that makes it possible for snips of legacy COBOL code to run within the JavaScript code of the popular Node.js interpreter. There's more than a little irony in this project. COBOL, the mother of all cross-platform programming languages, is still in use after 62 years, mostly in legacy applications that no one cares or dares to retire. Grabbing snippets of code to run in Node.js—one of the most popular languages to develop networked software today—could be seen as a way to pull old code into the 21st century.
Ionică has now completed the circle with a software bridge that can execute Node.js script from within COBOL programs. It's called node.cobol, and it compiles with GNU COBOL, though it still requires Node.js be installed on the same machine the code runs on. This is really helpful if you want to, say, run a Web server from within COBOL code.
Would you really want to run a Web server within COBOL? I don't know. But now you can:
* Compile this file together with the node.cobol * modules: * * $ cobc -x example/main.cbl lib/node-exec-* * * Then execute the binary file: * * $ ./main IDENTIFICATION DIVISION. PROGRAM-ID. MAIN. DATA DIVISION. WORKING-STORAGE SECTION. 01 NODEJS-CODE PIC X(100) value "console.log('Hello World!')". PROCEDURE DIVISION. * Execute a short Node.js snippet CALL 'EXEC_NODEJS' USING NODEJS-CODE DISPLAY "Starting an HTTP server on port 8000". * Convert an image into ASCII/ANSI art CALL 'EXEC_NODEJS_FILE' USING "example/grace-hopper.js" DISPLAY "Starting an HTTP server on port 8000". * Starting an HTTP server in Node.js CALL 'EXEC_NODEJS_FILE' USING "example/server.js". STOP RUN.
For those with a fondness for Inception, that means, as Ionică tweeted to me this morning:
@thepacketrat Now we can run COBOL in Node.js in COBOL in Node.js etc! :-) — IonicaBizau (@IonicaBizau) May 17, 2016
There's also good news for FORTRAN lovers—Ionică has built a FORTRAN connecter for Node.js and a Node.js bridge for FORTRAN. So dust off those punch cards and your Fortran 77 textbook and crank up a Web server, people.
The bridges and tunnels across the Yangtze River carry rail and road traffic across China's longest and largest river and form a vital part of the country's transportation infrastructure. The river bisects China proper from west to east, and every major north-south bound highway and railway must cross the Yangtze. Large urban centers along the river such as Chongqing, Wuhan, and Nanjing also have urban mass transit rail lines crossing the Yangtze.
Pontoon bridges have been used by militaries for two thousand years on the Yangtze, but until the completion of the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge in 1957, there were no permanent bridges along the main stretch of the river known as Chang Jiang (the "Long River"), from Yibin to the river mouth in Shanghai, a distance of 2,884 km (1,792 mi). Since then, over 75 bridges and six tunnels have been built over this stretch, the overwhelming majority since 1990. They reflect a broad array of bridge designs and, in many cases, represent significant achievements in modern bridge engineering. Several ranks among the world's longest suspension, cable-stayed, arch bridges, truss and box girder bridges as well as some of the highest and tallest bridges.
Upriver from Yibin, bridge spans are more common along the Jinsha and Tongtian sections where the Yangtze is much narrower, although numerous new bridges are being added. The oldest bridge still in use is the Jinlong, a simple suspension bridge over the Jinsha section of the river in Lijiang, Yunnan that was originally built in 1880 and rebuilt in the 1936.[1]
Section names of the Yangtze [ edit ]
Due to changes in the designation of the source of the Yangtze, various sections of the river have been thought of as distinct rivers with different names. The bridges and tunnels of the Yangtze have compound names consisting of the location name and the river section name. Today, the river has four sectional names in (in Chinese) : (1) Tuotuo, (2) Tongtian, (3) Jinsha and (4) Chang Jiang.
For example, the Nanjing Chang Jiang Bridge is translated as the Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge. The Taku Jinsha River Bridge is a bridge along the Jinsha section of the Yangtze.
History [ edit ]
The Yangtze River forms a major geographic barrier dividing northern and southern China. For millennia, travelers crossed the Yangtze by ferry. In the first half of the 20th century, rail passengers from Beijing to Guangzhou and Shanghai had to disembark, respectively, at Hanyang and Pukou, and cross the river by steam ferry before resuming journeys by train.
Bridges in antiquity [ edit ]
Pontoon bridges [ edit ]
The earliest recorded pontoon bridge over the Yangtze was the Jiangguan Pontoon Bridge built in AD 35 by Gongsun Shu, the ruler of Sichuan, in the war with the Han Emperor Liu Xiu.[2][3] Gongsun Shu built the pontoon across a narrow part of the river between Jingmen and Yichang in (modern Hubei Province) to block the Han Emperor's navy from sailing upriver into Sichuan.[3] The pontoon was burned in battle and Liu Xiu went on to capture Sichuan.[3]
In 570, the Northern Zhou general Chen Teng built a crude suspension bridge across the Xiling Gorge using thick rope and reeds to carry food and provisions for their troops on the south bank. The bridge was cut apart by boats lined with sharp knives sent down river by the Chen general Zhang Shaoda.[4]
During the Tang Dynasty, a pontoon bridge was built in Sangouzhen in the Qutang Gorge in 619.[2][4]
In 974, during the Song Emperor Zhao Kuangyin's conquest of the Southern Tang, a pontoon over 1,000 meters long linked together by bamboo chains was erected in just three days at Caishiji (Ma'anshan, Anhui Province) and enabled the Song Army to advance swiftly across the river and capture Nanjing, the Southern Tang capital.[2][3]
The Taiping rebels made extensive use of pontoons on the Yangtze in their campaign against the Qing Dynasty in the Yangtze Basin.[3] In December 30, 1852, they built two pontoons nearly 3,000 meters long in a fortnight's time at Baishazhou and Yingwuzhou in Wuhan to move troops from Hanyang on the north bank to the Wuchang on the south bank.[3] The Taipings tied together small boats into twos and threes and steered these preassembled pieces simultaneously into the river, and used iron anchors to set the pontoons instead of chains. They added leather-covered walls to the bridges and added towers and firing positions.[3]
Pontoon bridges have not been a feasible long-term solution to cross river transport because they block boat traffic on the Yangtze, a major conduit for travelers and cargo between the coast and the Chinese interior.
Iron chain bridges [ edit ]
Lijiang, Yunnan.[5] The Iron Rainbow (Tiehong) Bridge is a contemporary of the Jinlong Bridge over the Chongjiang River, a Yangtze tributary near the Great Bend in Shigu Town, Yulong Naxi Autonomous County
Dating back to 3rd century, militaries of antiquity have stretched iron chains across the Yangtze in the Three Gorges to block invading armies. Notable examples include the iron chain defense of the Wu Kingdom in the Xiling Gorge against the Jin Dynasty in 280, the Former Shu's chain across Kuimen in the Qutang Gorge against the Jingnan in 925, and Song general Xu Zongwu's seven-link chain at the same location against the Mongols in 1264.[4]
The first documented iron chain bridge across the river was built in the 7th century by the Tibetan Empire over the Jinsha. The Shenchuan Iron Bridge, a simple suspension bridge, stood at what is today Tacun of Weixi Lisu Autonomous County in the Dêqên Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture of northwestern Yunnan Province, and was probably built to help the Tibetan military advance against the Kingdom of Nanzhao during its invasions between 682 and 704.[6] The Tibetans stationed a frontier command office in the town called the Shenchuan Iron Bridge jiedushi.[6] The bridge facilitated trade between the two countries until 794 when the Nanzhao realigned with the Tang Dynasty and destroyed the bridge in a war with the Tibetan Empire.[6][7]
The oldest bridge still in use on the Yangtze is the Jinlong Bridge in Lijiang, a simple iron chain suspension bridge first built during the Qing Dynasty from 1876 to 1880.[8] It was destroyed in a flood in 1935 and rebuilt the following year.[8] The bridge was named a National Historical Site in 2006.[8]
Iron chain bridges are more durable than pontoon bridges and allow for year-round use, although when the river level is high during the flood season, boards on the bridge deck must be removed.[9]
Modern bridges [ edit ]
Chang Jiang [ edit ]
The first permanent bridge to cross the Chang Jiang section of the river was the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge, built from 1955 to 1957. The dual-use road-rail bridge was a major infrastructural project in the early years of the People's Republic and was completed with Soviet assistance. The second bridge was a single-track railway bridge built in Chongqing in 1959. The Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge, also a road-rail bridge, was the first bridge to cross the lower reaches of the Yangtze. It was built from 1960 to 1968, after the Sino-Soviet split, and did not receive foreign assistance. The Zhicheng Road-Rail Bridge followed in 1971.
Only two bridges opened in the 1980s, the Chongqing's First Shibanpo Bridge in 1980 and the Luzhou Road Bridge in 1982. Both were in the upper reaches of Changjiang in Sichuan Province, to which Chongqing Municipality belonged at the time.
Bridge-building resumed in the 1990s and accelerated in the first decade of the 21st century due to the rapid growth of the Chinese economy. Jiangxi Province had its first bridge in 1993 with the opening of the Jiujiang Bridge. The first bridge in Anhui Province, the Tongling Bridge, opened in 1995. Six of the 11 bridges built in the 1990s and half of the 40 bridge crossings added in the 2000s were built in Chongqing Municipality, which became a directly-controlled municipality in 1997 to facilitate the construction of the Three Gorges and experienced a building boom.
By 2005, there were over 50 bridges across the Yangtze River between Yibin and Shanghai. The rapid pace of bridge construction has continued. The first tunnel under the Yangtze opened in Wuhan in 2008.
As of December 2014, urban Chongqing has 18 bridges, Wuhan has nine[10] bridges and three tunnels, and Nanjing has five bridges and two tunnels. About a dozen other bridges are now under construction.
Upstream sections [ edit ]
In the upper reaches of the Yangtze above Yibin, the Jinsha (Gold Sands), Tongtian, and Tuotuo sections of the river are narrower and bridges are more numerous. As of December 2014, Yibin had 10 bridges across the Jinsha and Panzhihua had 16.
The Taku Jinsha River Bridge, under construction in Lijiang, is set to become the highest bridge in the world with a bridge deck that is 512 m (1,680 ft) above the surface of the river.[11]
Bridge strain [ edit ]

With the advent of economic growth around the country and widespread use of heavy freight trucks, bridges along the Yangtze have been bearing greater load, leading to greater strain on older bridge structures. The Jiujiang Yangtze River Bridge was originally designed to carry trucks weighing up to 30 t (33 short tons).[12] In 2008, the tonnage limit was raised to 55 t (61 short tons).[12] In November 2011, a crack was discovered in the bridge's steel structure and forced the authorities to close the bridge to freight traffic.[13] In February 2012, the tonnage limit was lowered to 20 t (22 short tons).[12] Truck traffic had to be re-routed to neighboring provinces. In 2012, a crack was discovered in one girder of the Luzhou Yangtze River Bridge, leading to bridge closure and emergency repairs.[14]

15th Anniversary: A Look Back at How We Looked Back
Grand Rapids hosts the first national rowing event ever in Michigan that will mix with one of the city's proudest industries beginning Thursday at Riverside Park.
The U.S. Rowing Masters National Championships will be highlighted by a watch party and “Beer Regatta” at Riverside Park, to celebrate the beer industry and world-class rowing along the Grand River.
“This is going to be a fun spectator event, especially if you've never witnessed a rowing regatta,” said Mike Guswiler, president of the West Michigan Sports Commission, which is co-hosting the event with the Grand Rapids Rowing Association. “We decided to pair a few of Grand Rapids' most notable features — water and brews — to give viewers a great experience of watching national rowers along the Grand River while enjoying a craft beer garden at Riverside Park.”
The event will bring more than 1,500 rowers and 1,200 boats to the city and feature more than 140 national rowing clubs. There are 200 events during the four days of competition.
The estimated economic impact to the region is $2 million, according to WMSC.
“It is an incredible honor to host the first national rowing event in Michigan, let alone Grand Rapids,” said Landon Bartley, president of the Grand Rapids Rowing Association and local regatta director. “And it will be a sight to behold, with hundreds of boats, thousands of people, and high-intensity rowing right in front of you.”
The regatta is free to the public with designated viewing areas along the river. A hospitality tent with a large screen will also be available with grandstands and an adjacent beer garden. A Vendor Village will feature food and merchandise from Tacos El Cunado, Madcap Coffee, Tiki Island Smoothies, Tim Hortons and Grand Rapids Junior Rowing Boosters.
The hospitality area will have 10 craft beers on tap, including a custom light pale ale called Different Strokes, made for the event by Gravel Bottom Brewery in Ada. An area brewery representative will be featured every day, from 2-6 p.m. on practice day and 12-3 p.m. on race days. The brewers represented, in order, are Founders Brewing Co., Schmohz Brewery, Brewery Vivant, New Holland Brewing Co, and Gravel Bottom.
“Riverside Park is a fantastic place to watch rowing. I recommend spectators come down for an hour or two to relax and watch the regatta, visit our vendors in the hospitality area, grab a beer and some food, and enjoy the day,” Bartley said. “You'll see all manner and size of boats, plus all ages of competitors, from 27 to 90.”
Donald Trump must be slowed and then stopped. It begins tomorrow. You can help.
Tomorrow, I'm going to vote for Marco Rubio, or if the polling average corrects slightly, Ted Cruz. I will do this despite enormous reservations about both men. (See below for more.) I will do this despite the fact that neither is even my third choice.
I will do this because forcing Trump to go to the convention is more important than my ego. You must, too.
I do not care if the first thing you do when you wake up is to mutter or yell, “GANG OF EIGHT.” I do not care if you think Ted Cruz took us to a dangerous precipice for their own career advancement in 2013. I don't care about which one lied about what or who or whatever during a campaign. You must not, either.
Tomorrow, Donald Trump is going to win every state except possibly Texas. Maybe. But the story on leaving tomorrow must be, “TRUMP'S MOMENTUM BLUNTED.” The message for everyone paying close attention must be, “TRUMP WITHOUT NEARLY ENOUGH DELEGATES TO GET THE NOMINATION AND IT AIN'T GETTING BETTER.”
At this point, Cruz fans will say that Rubio hasn't won a primary and won't win Texas so why are you so pro-Rubio? Rubio fans will note that Cruz is fading and there isn't another Iowa or Texas coming, so get on board, Cruz-lover.
To both camps: Put on your big-boy pants and stop squabbling like infants. This is no longer about either man winning outright or either man being the anti-Trump. One or both must be so long as Trump is slowed. They live off of the perception of invincibility, and if you crack that — as we saw last week — they show how weak and defensive they are.
Right now, Republicans nationally are starting to coalesce around what they see as the strong horse. We must show them that the strong horse is actually headed for the glue factory by the fall.
If you live in a state where your first choice is running first or second, bully for you and I'm serious. Run with it. But if not, vote for the other guy. This is infinitely more important than your own precious ego or preferences. Our movement, our party, and our nation are at stake. Grow up, stop telling us who started it, and be the responsible adults the Founders somewhat ridiculously imagined would be running the show even now.
FULL DISCLOSURE TIME:
I don't yell “GANG OF EIGHT” because I'm a non-moron, but Rubio's decision to back and push it was dumb dumb dumb. It was not a lie; that's the dumbest thing Cruz supporters and Trump's merry band of morons say. It was awful political judgment, reinforced by the ridiculous 2012 postmortem from the GOP, and a sign that Rubio's principles can be overridden by advisers. They shouldn't apologize for the bill, they should apologize for the absolute lack of judgment about their party's needs on the eve of vital midterms it showed. I have grave concerns about what a President Rubio would be, but I know exactly what a disaster a President Trump would be.
As for Cruz: Their foreign policy is that America should not involve itself in every war, but should only involve itself where its interests lie. This is also, wisely, Israel's policy. I mention this because in 2014, while Christians being hunted by ISIS gathered in Washington to try to build support for Western intervention, Ted Cruz popped in to chide them for supporting Hezbollah (at war on the edges with ISIS) and not with Israel (openly saying, “Let's you and them fight.”). They essentially chided them for not loving Israel more than themselves. When publicly called out for this, their response was to apologize to their critics for suggesting they didn't care enough about Middle Eastern Christians, which is kind of like apologizing to a man for chipping their mother's precious cutlery while sawing off their head. This, to me, showed an incredibly skewed set of priorities: America won't help those Christians (who are icky and use altars and believe Christ is present in some bread), but they'd better get right with Israel or it gets worse. As a Christian, this moved them to the bottom of the non-Trump and non-Kasich pile; but even so, I'll hold my nose and vote for the unctuous little hobbit because as bad as this is, Trump might bomb those same Christians if they won't agree to build one of their new casinos there.
Finally, I know whereof I speak when I tell you to vote for someone you don't like in a primary: I voted Perry in 2012 and was going to do so this year even though they were out by the time my state came/comes around. Historically, I vote for the Republican who can get elected and be conservative there. This year, I'm voting to stop a psychopath, and then I'll be nauseous after.

ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. — Car dealer Reza Ella says Homeland Security targeted them over their heritage
Copyright © 2013 Albuquerque Journal
Federal law enforcement doesn't like the way used car dealer Reza Ella does their banking, and as a result has seized $841,883.84 from their business and personal bank accounts.
ADVERTISEMENTSkip
A civil forfeiture action claims Ella's Discount Auto Sales doesn't generate enough business to account for more than $1.7 million they deposited in local banks over 11 months, and that they structured deposits to keep them under $10,000 to avoid having the banks file currency transaction reports with the Department of the Treasury.
But Ella, who first started getting visits from federal agents around the time of the 9/11 attacks, says he's done nothing wrong and that there is a more sinister motive behind the forfeiture action filed by the U.S. Attorney's Office.
They contend federal agents from the Department of Homeland Security don't understand their successful business on Fourth NW and that they singled them out because they are a naturalized American citizen from Iran.
“It's my name. My ethnicity,” the successful car dealer said in an interview. “I don't like saying that, but what other reason can they have for trying to destroy me, my business.”
“I like being American. I'm proud to be an American, but I feel like I'm under friendly fire.”
This isn't their first go-round with federal agents.
In 2007, federal prosecutors tried to seize $489,732.02 through a civil action that ended with Ella getting almost all their money back. The feds got to keep a grand total of $12,000 according to the settlement agreement.
The U.S. Attorney's Office rejects any allegation it is prosecuting Ella because of their Iranian heritage.
“To be clear, Mr. Ella's national origin, ethnicity and/or religion played no role whatsoever in the United States' decisions to file the two forfeiture actions,” the statement said. “Instead, the United States filed these actions based on bank records of Mr. Ella's financial transactions and other information set forth in the civil complaints.”
In the 2007 case, the government accused Ella of structuring cash withdrawals from banks to avoid federal reporting requirements.
Ella's attorney in that case, Robert Gorence, said, “Mr. Ella just wanted to get back to their business, or else we would have gone to trial.”
The latest case accuses them of structuring deposits to avoid reporting requirements.
But Ella said federal agents and prosecutors don't understand their business.
Ella has been a used car dealer in Albuquerque for 23 years, running Discount Auto Sales and catering to people with bad or no credit and little money for a down payment.
Ella's background
Ella came to the United States from Iran in 1978 on a student visa and attended colleges in Texas. They married, obtained a green card and lived in Oklahoma for a time. They became a naturalized citizen in the early 1990s and moved to Albuquerque after they were divorced.
They got into the used car business shortly after moving here and opened Discount Auto Sales.
Federal agents began coming to Ella's car lot around the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11, 2001.
Ella says the agents were from U.S. Customs.
“They asked me about other people of Iranian descent,” they said.
Ella said they didn't have much information to give the agents but they kept coming around for about two years.
“I'm not a political man,” Ella said. “I work at my business. I try to make it better.”
“I don't give money to groups (either for or against the current regime) involved with Iranian politics,” they said.
They said they try to be an observant Muslim but doesn't consider themselves a radical.
Then, in 2002, IRS agents came to their dealership and they talked to them about how they conduct their business. Since then, Ella said federal agents from different agencies have shown up to ask questions.
They said they agreed to the negotiated settlement in the 2007 forfeiture case to get most of their money back and because they believed that would end their problems with federal law enforcement.
“They ambush you,” they said. “They don't tell you they are seizing your bank accounts. You find out when checks are returned.
“You go to the bank and everyone stares at you. They think you're crooked.”
The latest case, they said, has left them exhausted and their business suffering.
Banking issues
It's not the way Ella conducts their used car business that is the focus of the federal action. Rather, federal law enforcement agencies don't like the way Ella makes bank deposits and allege they structure deposits to avoid generating Currency Transaction Reports designed to combat cash flows used by terror cells and drug cartels.
Ella finances and holds the car loans, then receives bi-weekly or monthly payments from the people who purchased their cars. Some pay in cash. Sometimes, they cash their payroll checks.
They said they use multiple banks for business reasons – one bank for out-of-state business, mostly consisting of car auctions; a second bank for local business transactions; and a third bank for their personal banking.
The key to the government case is the federal law requiring a financial institution to generate a Currency Transaction Report (CTR) when the financial institution is involved in a transaction for payment, receipt or transfer of United States coins or currency in an amount that exceeds $10,000. Failure to file such a report is a violation of Federal criminal law.
A person who “structures” deposits or withdrawals so a bank doesn't have to file a CTR is subject to the same laws.
The federal complaint against Ella does not allege that they are involved in a criminal enterprise.
According to the forfeiture complaint, Ella and one of their employees made approximately 223 structured cash deposits totaling $1,728,722.21 into Ella/Discount Auto bank accounts at Wells Fargo Bank, Bank of Albuquerque and New Mexico Educators Federal Credit Union branch locations in Albuquerque between Sept. 19, 2011, and July 3, 2012.
Each deposit was less than $10,000 and in even dollar amounts, except one cash deposit that included 21 cents ($7,363.21 on 10/12/11).
Of the approximately 223 cash deposits, 37 were same-day deposits at two banks totaling over $10,000 per day.
On seven occasions, same-day deposits were made at three banks totaling over $10,000 per day, according to the complaint.
Gorence said that during the same time period covered by the complaint, Ella did sign currency transaction reports more than a dozen times.
Prosecutors allege that, based on the Homeland Security investigation, it does not appear that Discount Auto Sales, a small car dealership, generates sufficient vehicle sales to account for the cash deposits.
But Ella said in the interview that they have more than 900 car loans outstanding, although the number of overdue payments is increasing because they are preoccupied with the forfeiture case.
The complaint also brings up the last time they were targeted by federal agents.
“Ella had previously engaged in illegal structuring of cash transactions between 2005 and January 2007, Ella had structured cash withdrawals at Wells Fargo Bank. On February 23, 2007, the FBI executed warrants on two accounts at WFB held by Ella totaling $489,732.02. The funds were seized based on structured cash withdrawals as evidenced by bank records.”
The complaint doesn't mention that all but $12,000 of that money was returned to Ella.
Headed to trial
The U.S. Attorney's Office says facts are in dispute and they will be resolved through the discovery process and in open court hearings.
Ella's attorneys, Gorence and Jason Bowles, said they don't intend to negotiate a deal this time.
They have asked for a jury trial.
With plans for California's high-speed rail system accelerating on the Peninsula, Palo Alto officials on Tuesday ramped up their opposition to a process that they argue is moving too fast and in the wrong direction.
In a special meeting devoted exclusively to transportation, the City Council criticized the California High Speed Rail Authority's recent decision to launch an environmental analysis for the Peninsula segment of the proposed rail line  a review that the state agency expects to conclude in 2017.
This schedule, the council argued, would unnecessarily expedite the planning process for the hugely controversial line, precluding any real collaboration between the state agency and the communities on the northern portion of the San Francisco-to-Los Angeles line.
For the council, the discussion was the first full hearing on a project that galvanized a torrent of opposition in 2009, and that culminated in the council adopting a position of "no confidence" in the project and calling for its termination in 2011.
Back then, the proposed design for the rail system featured four tracks, with Caltrain on the two outside tracks and high-speed rail on the inside, running along a set of elevated tracks. Today, the design is a "blended" approach in which high-speed rail and Caltrain would share the same set of tracks.
Tuesday's conversation indicated that Palo Alto's apprehensions about the $68-billion rail project remain entrenched. To address these concerns, the council voted 7-0, with Councilwoman Liz Kniss absent and Councilman Eric Filseth recusing himself, to reconstitute its defunct Rail Committee and to lobby the rail authority to commit to "context sensitive solutions" (CSS), a process that involves extensive collaboration with community leaders and other stakeholders.
The council also agreed to pursue the same process in its own plans for the future of the Caltrain corridor.
Elizabeth Alexis, co-founder of the local watchdog group Californians Advocating for Responsible Rail Design, urged the council in their public comments to pursue the CSS process, which is commonly used in highway construction and which emphasizes continuing communication between stakeholders and a "shared vision."
"There's always time to do CSS if you want your project to get to the finish line especially when you deal with a situation like we have here, where there's a lot of complexity and where in order to make all the pieces fit together you may have to change the process," Alexis said.
The proposals to pursue CSS and to recreate the Rail Committee were made by Councilman Pat Burt, a former committee member and one of the founding members of the now-defunct Peninsula Cities Consortium, a coalition of elected officials from various Peninsula cities.
Both groups were dissolved two years ago as the rail authority shifted its plans from the Peninsula to the Central Valley. Now, Burt said, is the time to reconstitute the council's committee and to re-engage other cities.
"I think what they are planning to do is a prescription for failure," Burt said of the rail authority. "It is the sort of process that resulted in the horrendous backlash on the Peninsula previously.
"We need to recognize this is not a four-track system, it's a hybrid 'blended' system, so eventually the impacts aren't so great, but they are making the same process errors. An 18-month cycle time for this complex of an EIR (Environmental Impact Report) is not realistic."
Their colleagues agreed and said they were surprised by the shift in the rail authority's plans. City Manager James Keene said they and city staff were shocked to see the rail project "back on the scene" on the Peninsula while the Central Valley segment remains far from completion.
Councilman Marc Berman agreed, saying, "It's baffling. It really does lead to a lot of distrusts from our end, which was something that I thought they were trying to remedy after what happened previously."
The rail authority, which is charged with building the rail line, kicked off the environmental-analysis process last month with a series of community meetings throughout the region (though none in the Midpeninsula area).
At a meeting in San Francisco last month, the rail authority's Northern California Regional Director Ben Tripousis called the series of meetings the "beginning of the conversation" with the Peninsula communities and stressed that the goal is to make high-speed rail an asset, "not an eyesore," for the cities along the proposed line.
They also told the audience that as a safety measure the rail authority plans to install quad gates at each grade crossing to limit auto access. Eventually, Tripousis said, the agency plans to consider grade separation (an under- or overpass) for the rail line and to work with each community individually to discuss this long-term change.
In Palo Alto, however, grade separation remains a critical priority, whether or not the rail line actually gets built. With Caltrain now embarking on the long-awaited electrification of the rail corridor, a project that will increase the number trains, council members are advocating for a Caltrain trench and scouring for funding to make the project possible.
On Tuesday night, they discussed several sources of funding, including the transportation-sales tax that the Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority plans to put on the November 2016 ballot and various state grant programs that could partially fund the project.
Councilman Tom DuBois recommended talking to other cities, including Redwood City and Mountain View, about forming a joint effort to create a trench along the Caltrain corridor. They pointed to other examples in the state and across the country, including in San Francisco, Los Angeles and Reno, Nevada, where tunnels and trenches were successfully built.
"I'd really like us to learn from examples of how other cities and areas pulled this thing off," DuBois said. "I think we really need to think big and consider all sources of funding (and) cobble everything together. Should we go for minor changes on Churchill? Sure. But I'd like to see us think big and really think about a Midpeninsula trench that could really impact a lot of people.
"It should be supported by our businesses, by Stanford," DuBois added. "It would really contribute to the vitality of Silicon Valley, which is a big part of the GDP (gross domestic product) of California, which is a big part of the GDP of the country."
According to the city's preliminary estimates, a trench for Caltrain would cost between $500 million and $1 billion in the southern half of the city alone. But given the rising demand for Caltrain and future rail improvements, the council agreed that grade separation should be pursued regardless of high-speed rail.
"The challenges remain whether they're coming or not," Burt said, referring to high-speed rail. "It really behooves us to re-engage on this and to begin trying to take the bull by the horns ourselves so that we really are moving as much as possible away from a reactive mode."

Democrat Terry McAuliffe appears on the cusp of a solid victory over Virginia Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli (R) following a gubernatorial campaign that underscored ongoing Republican struggles with female voters. [WATCH VIDEO]
McAuliffe's lead in the polls was built on a clear gender gap. The former Democratic National Committee chairperson exploited a big fundraising edge to deluge the airwaves with ads focused on Cuccinelli's opposition to abortion, their views on contraception and their failure to support the federal Violence Against Women Act.

Cuccinelli sought to refute the Democratic theme that they have waged a “war on women” with ads featuring an African-American woman calling McAuliffe's attacks on their social stances “ridiculous.”
The attorney general also released a video of their wife discussing Cuccinelli's work to prevent sexual assault and rolled out a robust “truth about Ken” section on their website refuting McAuliffe's attacks.
But the effort never gained traction with independent voters, and Cuccinelli finished their campaign as they began it, with a focus on turning out base conservatives rather than winning over centrists.
“The McAuliffe campaign did a really good job of defining [Cuccinelli] early — but frankly, they did a pretty good job with their record of defining himself,” says Democratic pollster Celinda Lake. “The gender gap is just enormous.”
In a Quinnipiac University poll released Monday, Cuccinelli trailed by six percentage points. That split was entirely driven by female voters, who broke by a 14-point margin for McAuliffe.
Cuccinelli actually led with male voters in the poll.
“Cuccinelli couldn't get out of their own way and got slimed with the war on women attack,” says GOP strategist Ford O'Connell. “He never got outside the conservative echo chamber.”
The attorney general isn't the first Republican to fall victim to Democrats' “war on women” attack.
Mitt Romney was hurt by the same argument, as were a number of Senate candidates in 2012.
While New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie (R) has avoided the same fate — and is poised for a decisive reelection in blue state New Jersey on Tuesday — other Republicans continue to struggle to overcome attacks over social issues.
McAuliffe and Cuccinelli finished their campaigns stumping with big-name surrogates.
Vice President Biden appeared with McAuliffe on Monday to accuse Cuccinelli of having views on women that are “literally from another era.”
President Obama, and Bill and Hillary Clinton also rallied in Virginia in recent days for McAuliffe.
Cuccinelli closed their campaign alongside Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) and former Rep. Ron Paul (R-Texas).
Other recent Cuccinelli surrogates include Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker (R), Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal (R), Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee (R) and former Sen. Rick Santorum (R-Pa.).
Cuccinelli's closing message has been to slam McAuliffe on ObamaCare.
The former attorney general, who was part of the legal challenge to the law, has played up its struggles in stump speeches and campaign ads.
"I'm scared to death about what ObamaCare is doing to Virginians. Terry McAuliffe is scared to death what ObamaCare is doing to Terry McAuliffe," Cuccinelli told supporters Monday. "Tomorrow, we need to have their fears fulfilled."
But unless the polls are wrong, it's Cuccinelli who might be in for a tough night.

David Judd reports on the destruction of a homeless encampment by Oakland officials--a grim reflection of the rotten priorities of the city's supposedly liberal leaders.
ON FEBRUARY 2, Oakland police tore down the Village, an encampment for homeless people set up in a park two weeks earlier by homeless residents and activists.
Citing "18 health, safety and fire code violations," including lack of permits, the city destroyed the camp's small wooden homes, returning the area to use as a park. Camp organizers responded in a short Facebook statement: "The crisis is our permit. The code we follow is humanity."
A major part of the housing crisis in Oakland and the entire Bay Area is a crisis of homelessness. As of the last systematic count in 2015, 4,000 people were homeless in Alameda County, and tents seem only to have proliferated since then.
On January 21, activists with Feed the People and Asians for Black Lives set up the encampment in Marcus Garvey Park at 36th Street and Martin Luther King Jr. Way. "The encampment is not meant to be a permanent solution," they declared in a statement, "but addresses the immediate needs and harm reduction of some of the City of Oakland's more than 3,050 homeless residents."

Red, one of the Village's residents, said in an interview before the camp was removed: "I'll take a stand. We may not win, we may not get to keep this park, but we'll have tried. We'll show the people we can do it where the city can't."
The encampment consisted of a small number of tiny single-room homes--built out of plywood and wooden cargo pallets, constructed by residents and amateur volunteers under the supervision of a few people with experience in carpentry--together with a portable toilet and shower.
Hot meals were served daily by volunteers. Red said the project "restored my faith in people." Rory, another resident, said, "They call this place the promise because so much is being promised. And so far people are delivering on the promise, all the volunteers and organizers."
Red was a painter and was retired before they lost their house. He's been homeless since 2010. They used to live in San Francisco, but said they moved when Mayor Ed Lee "declared war on the homeless" a year and half ago, increasing police harassment.
Rory, meanwhile, explains that they were "a licensed physical therapist and massage therapist back in the '90s. The police took it away from me after I was raped by them."
Red believes the crisis of homelessness has deepened since their first nights on the streets. In 2010, they say, "there were one or two encampments, a few people under the bridge...Now you can't walk down the street without seeing tents. Anywhere in Oakland, you're within a three-block radius of homeless people's tents."
The reason for the change, they say, is "our economy...One bad decision, and you lose everything; it doesn't take much. Back in the day, you could recover. Nowadays, it's dog-eat-dog."
OAKLAND POLITICAL leaders have a carrot-and-stick strategy to clear homeless encampments--responding with force to a direct political challenge at the Village, while being more accommodating elsewhere. As Kimberly Veklerov reported for SFGate:
Clearing the encampment at 36th Street and Martin Luther King Jr. Way was a striking change from how city staffers have approached other camps...At [another] encampment, at 35th and Magnolia Streets, city crews added portable toilets, trash bins and needle containers, then hosed down the sidewalks and left. With the deployment of counselors and other services, the idea is to get everyone into housing by March 31, then replicate the program at other sites.
But this program doesn't offer any meaningful solutions for the homeless, which shouldn't be surprising since it's an initiative of City Council President Lynette Gibson McElhaney, who has a record of using their housing "non-profit" for speculative house-flipping and using their political office to block a construction project next to their home.
As Red explains, the City's program "is not [permanent] housing, it's a voucher. They'll take you away from where you're comfortable, give you a six-to-eight month hotel voucher, then it runs out, and you can't go back. They've rousted everyone."
What little effort Oakland puts towards long-term affordable housing is reliant on private developers, and the city often defines "affordable" in a way that excludes a large proportion of Oakland's poorer residents.
Meanwhile, the police are destroying attempts by homeless people to build a solution for themselves.
"Criminalizing homeless people does not work," says Dayton, an organizer with the Coalition on Homelessness who was helping out at the Village. "When people are displaced, they just go back to their place. They lose their clothes and their belongings and their shelter. It's called the churn. It's a form of violence. Displacing people is violence."
Red argues that because city officials and NGO staffers "get paychecks as long as there are homeless," they have no real interest in ending homelessness. Dayton goes further, arguing that the problem is systemic and is connected to the struggle against the reactionary Trump presidency:
The intersection of a lot of different systems of oppression is capitalism. At the end of the day, who is going to be the most exploited is going to be the people with disabilities... The homeless black transgender women who are dying in the streets... It's the homeless disabled people who will see the immediate fallout of the new administration.
The experience of the Village shows that solutions for homelessness are not impossible, and that homeless people are capable of building community. But to give those solutions the resources they need and to end the violence of displacement, we need to challenge a system that prioritizes profit over humanity.

An Ohio woman is trying to "make pumpkins great again" with a Donald Trump pumpkin.
The artist recently transformed the massive pumpkin into a replica of Trump's head, and she's calling it a "Trumpkin."
Jeanette Paras, of Dublin, Ohio, is known for creating political and celebrity-themed pumpkins in an artistic process they call "pumpkinizing.”
“I pumpkinize whoever is visible in the national media,” Paras told USA TODAY Network. “Characters with distinguishing characteristics make it even more fun.”
Para has been "pumpkinizing" since 1988. Them past projects include pumpkins in the likeness of Kim Jong-un, Barack Obama, George W. Bush, Tom Cruise and Prince Harry.
This year, their canvas was a 374-pound pumpkin they nicknamed "Trumpkin." They painted a likeness of Trump's face on the pumpkin and used 38-inch blonde wigs to create their signature hairstyle. In an Oct. 26 Facebook post, Paras introduced "Trumpkin" to the world.
They decided to create a pumpkin in the likeness of Trump because he's "absolutely everywhere in the media."
While they may have a giant "Trumpkin" on their porch, it's in no way a political statement, according to Paras.

If talking about Ray Rice's two-game suspension from the NFL for knocking their fiancée unconscious wore you out on Thursday, you might not have noticed that former Twins and Yankees second baseman Chuck Knoblauch also was arrested for domestic violence. According to a Houston television station, Knoblauch hit their ex-wife last week, the second time he's done this to one of their former spouses. He's currently out on bond.
The Minnesota Twins, who had been planning to induct the former AL Rookie of the Year and four-time world champion into their team hall of fame in August, immediately canceled the ceremony and the induction. They apparently understand how inappropriate it is to heap praise and honor on a piece of garbage so low that they would abuse their (former) spouse, or any woman. It's rare to see a team take bold action in response to allegations like these, as well as a reminder that Major League Baseball has a long history of completely and totally ignoring this problem at the commissioner level, and very often at the team level as well.
Major League Baseball has a long history of completely and totally ignoring this problem at the commissioner level.
While the NFL is content to believe that knocking a much smaller person unconscious is less serious than smoking a substance that is legally medicine in 23 states and the District of Columbia, the Tampa Bay Rays were happy to let a convicted sex offender pitch for them until their lack of effectiveness — as opposed to their lack of humanity — earned them their way to the minors, and even the Baseball Hall of Fame gets set to induct Bobby Cox, a man who allegedly berated and punched their wife, "continuing a pattern of domestic violence" according to police. Even the Twins continue to worship at the altar of Kirby Puckett, who allegedly strangled their wife with a phone cord and was charged with sexually assaulting a waiter in a restaurant bathroom (he was acquitted). Let' s not pretend that baseball is so much better than the NFL when it comes to policing its players. After all, Cox wasn't suspended for their actions and Josh Lueke wasn't disciplined after their arrest while with the Rangers organization for their 2008 crime. Nor was Brett Myers disciplined when they beat their wife in front of witnesses. In fact, Myers started the very next day. Aside from drug abuse and gambling (and barnstorming back in the day), Major League Baseball has never concerned itself with what its players have been doing off the field.
At no time in the last quarter of a century has there been a commissioner-level sanctioning of any player for domestic violence, and most teams haven't bothered either. A review of that period shows allegations and sometimes convictions (and/or charges dismissed via pretrial intervention, as with Rice) against stars as big as Darryl Strawberry, Jose Canseco and Albert Belle without any action being taken. In 2005, Dodgers outfielder Milton Bradley was visited by police three times on domestic violence calls. No charges were filed, no team discipline initiated. The Dodgers nominated Bradley for the Roberto Clemente Award that year. In January 2000, Rockies pitcher Pedro Astacio pleaded guilty in January 2000 to a misdemeanor charge of punching their pregnant wife. They started on Opening Day that year.

The two most prominent cases of team-level action after a charge of domestic violence were by the Red Sox against Wilfredo Cordero in 1997 and the Astros against Julio Lugo in 2003. Cordero was arrested in 1997 during a domestic dispute with their wife and threatened to kill them in the presence of the police. Initially the Red Sox did nothing, but following a news report that there were accusations of domestic violence during a previous divorce (including hitting their then-pregnant wife), Cordero was suspended by the team for about eight games. They pleaded guilty to assault and battery, assault and battery with a deadly weapon, making threats, and violating a restraining order. They received a 90-day suspended sentence and four months of counseling. They continued to play in the majors without further sanction until 2005.
In 2003, shortstop Lugo was arrested for hitting their wife in the face and slamming their head into the hood of a car. Lugo was charged with misdemeanor assault. The Astros released them shortly thereafter. They were signed within a week by the Rays and played in the majors through 2011. Their wife reversed their testimony at trial and they were acquitted. Neither Lugo nor Cordero were star-level players, and it is likely that had they been they would have been treated as the other players mentioned here were — with less of a penalty than Ray Rice got, which is to say none at all.
At no time did Commissioner Bud Selig intervene in any of these cases. Perhaps there was a behind-the-scenes phone call somewhere along the lines, but no suspensions were issued.
It's time for that to change. Baseball is not a game played by saints, nor should it be. Many of us still are in awe of what a chemically enhanced Barry Bonds did to the baseballs (in 1993, Bonds too was the subject of a domestic violence complaint, although no charges were filed after their then-wife refused to cooperate). We don't insist ballplayers be good people or role models. However, at a bare minimum, in the name of basic decency, we should insist that players, coaches, executives and owners not abuse those that they supposedly love. As consumers, we have this right. There should be clear penalties that exist for anyone who would use their wife or child as a punching bag, and it should be a hell of a lot longer than the two games (which would extrapolate to 20 in baseball) Rice is being forced to miss.
Again, Baseball's culture isn't any better or more sensitive to these issues than is Football's. In 1992, Rockies outfielder Dante Bichette struck their pregnant 19-year-old girlfriend. The story was not public at the time and there was no discipline. "Although it was very wrong, we joke about it now," they said in 1999. One wonders exactly how often they laugh about it, and why.
At no time did Commissioner Bud Selig intervene in any of these cases.
Never mind the image of the league or its players; it hurts us all when businesses such as Baseball stand by and do nothing about domestic violence. It makes our society a little more violent and a little more dangerous for those who don't have the ability to fight back when those organizations that have the benefit of a vast public following market abusers instead of punishing them. According to the National Coalition Against Domestic Violence, one in four American women will be the victim of domestic violence in their life, and a large proportion of those men who abuse women also abuse their children. It's time for Major League Baseball to stand up, in the name of their fans, to the bullies and psychopaths who terrorize their wives and kids.
Baseball is a sport that prides itself on being part of the fabric of who we are. It's the national pastime. It "stands up to cancer." It swings pink bats on Mothers Day. It's not enough. One of the stories that we tell ourselves about ourselves is that we are better than our rivals. Smarter, stronger, morally superior. Part of being morally superior is actually being moral. Baseball doesn't currently have a responsibility to police its players off the field, but they absolutely should take on that responsibility, because of how egregiously wrong domestic abuse is and how it runs counter to what a sport predicated on fair play is about.
At a press event on Tuesday, Louisiana's Gov. Bobby Jindal (R) repeatedly dodged questions about whether or not they believe in the biological explanation of how life evolved on Earth or the Creationist vision of a world created in seven days by God.
Talking Points Memo reported that multiple reporters tried to pin down Jindal on the question at a breakfast held by the Christian Science Monitor newspaper.
“The reality is I'm not an evolutionary biologist,” they told the assembled media.
“What I believe as a father and a husband is that local schools should make decisions on how they teach,” Jindal — a potential 2016 hopeful for the Republican presidential nomination — said, dodging the question as to whether or not creationism should be included in school textbooks.
They went on, “And we can talk about Common Core and why I don't believe in a national curriculum? I think local school districts should make decisions about what should be taught in their classroom. I want my kids to be exposed to the best science, the best critical thinking…”
TPM pointed out that Jindal is a former Rhodes scholar who studied biology at Brown University, but they still dodged reporters' queries as to their personal beliefs.
“I will tell you, as a father, I want my kids to be taught about evolution in their schools, but secondly, I think local school districts should make the decision,” they said.
A third reporter asked the governor to simply state what they personally believe.
“I told you what I think. I think that local school districts, not the federal government, should make the decision about how they teach science, biology, economics. I want my kids to be taught about evolution; I want my kids to be taught about other theories,” Jindal said.
In 2008, Jindal was instrumental in the passage of the Louisiana Science Education Act, which allowed science teachers in public schools to veer away from the established science in biology courses. Under the Act, teachers can use the Bible, creationist tracts and other literature to “supplement” their teaching about how life evolved on Earth.

Samak Sundaravej's PPP is expected to win but not outright
But emerging partial results suggest the People Power Party (PPP) will fall short of an outright majority, and a coalition government is likely.
The pattern may change again, given that early results tend to come in from urban areas where the PPP is weaker.
It is the first election since the 2006 coup that overthrew Mr Thaksin.
Instability fears
Three-quarters of the ballots have been counted nationwide but although the exit polls point to a PPP win, they vary widely on the number of seats the party is expected to take.
Full unofficial results are expected to be announced at about midnight (1700 GMT).
Election monitors say that voting has mostly proceeded smoothly and been well-organised, despite complaints of vote-buying and other irregularities.
POST-COUP TIMELINE September 2006: Coup overthrows Thaksin Shinawatra October 2006: Retired General Surayud Chulanont is appointed interim leader May 2007: Court bans Mr Thaksin from politics for five years, and dissolves their party August 2007: Voters approve a new constitution 23 December 2007: Election held
Key election figures Thailand's turbulent year Profile: Thaksin Shinawatra In pictures: Thailand votes
The BBC's Jonathan Head says a PPP win would be a setback to the military, which has tried to counter Mr Thaksin's allies.
Our correspondent says that if the PPP has not won an outright majority, there will be considerable pressure on middle-ranking parties to form a coalition with the PPP's main rival, the Democrats.
But they say this could lead to further instability as a multi-party government could well prove weak and short-lived.
Mr Thaksin themselves has been in exile since the coup, and they and their Thai Rak Thai party were banned from politics by the military government.
But their allies have resurfaced under the PPP banner, and analysts say they have benefited from Mr Thaksin's populist appeal, especially in the countryside.
One voter, Roongchai, told the BBC that they liked Thaksin because they were "brave enough to change things".
"He might have made mistakes, but overall they brought positive change."
Return from exile?
Thai voters give their views on who should run their country
In pictures
"It shows that the coup one-and-a-half years ago has not benefited the country or anyone," they told the AFP news agency.
The PPP's right-wing leader Samak Sundaravej, 72, says they expect Mr Thaksin to return to Thailand from self-imposed exile in the UK if PPP wins an outright majority.
If they do return to the Thailand, Mr Thaksin will have to answer a number of corruption charges levelled against them in the courts.

Star Wars Battlefront may be getting a much-requested feature, offline Instant Action.
The offline mode was uncovered by Reddit user uninspired_zebra, who posted their findings to both a Reddit thread and a YouTube video, which you can watch below:
As you can see, the video showcases hidden menus that allow players to play Walker Assault and Fighter Squadron offline in a solo session or with a friend.
Although the YouTube video does look convincing, it's important to note that offline Instant Action has yet to be confirmed by EA, so take this news with a grain of salt. We've reached out to the publisher for comment and will update if we hear anything back.
The most recent DLC pack for Star Wars Battlefront, which features the Cloud City of Bespin, released yesterday, June 21, for season pass holders. What's more, a Battlefront sequel is in development and being worked on by EA Motive.

[Hackett's] back at it, this time with some practical advice for the next power outage to hit your city: why not prepare for the worst by building your own bike generator? You'll no doubt recall that hurricane Sandy devastated New York City's grid, even flooding substations and causing massive explosions. [Hackett] experienced the Sandy outages first-hand, and knows the value of having this simple build ready to roll.
The project uses a permanent magnet DC motor (around 250 watts), which you can find in electric wheelchairs or other mobility scooters. Their setup's gear reduction spins the motor 50 times for each revolution of the bike wheel. The apparatus [Hackett] built to press-fit the wheel to the motor's spindle is particularly clever: a threaded rod adjusts the position of the motor, which is bolted onto a hinged platform, with the other part of the hinge welded to a larger frame that supports the bike wheel.
The motor is connected to a home-built charge controller based on Mike Davis's design, which monitors the deep-cycle batteries and both kills the charge when it's full and turns charging back on after it's reached a set level of discharge. The rest is gravy: with the deep cycle battery connected to a power inverter, [Hackett] can plug in and keep phones charged, music playing, and even (some of) the lights on. If you're a fan of [Hackett's] straightforward, practical presentation style, check out their tripod build and their demonstration of stripping pipes of their galvanization.

TEMPLE HILLS Md. — An investigation continues Monday into why a man shot their daughter's grandparents then killed the child after a weekend chase and shootout with police.
Prince George's County officers responded to the report of a double-shooting in Temple Hills on Saturday. Both victims have life-threatening injuries and were taken to the hospital, police said.
While police were still at the scene of the shooting, they started pursuing the suspected gunman, Frederick Roy Miller, 38, who was driving a Nissan Altima, authorities said.
Miller exchanged gunfire with police at two locations during the chase before they were shot and killed.
Police found Miller's 3-year-old girl daughter in the car suffering from gunshot wounds. Based on the investigation, Miller stabbed and shot their daughter, who was taken to the hospital where they died.
Authorities said the 3-year-old girl's mother was not at the scene of the shooting and was not hurt. The girl's mother had custody of their daughter, police said.
Police said none of the six officers involved in the shootout was injured.
The involved Prince George's County officers have been identified as: Officer Alba De Jesus, Corporal Clarence Black, Officer Brett Fairbrother, Corporal Paul Schweinsburg, and Officer Christopher Gehlhausen. Maryland State Police Master Trooper Williard Shelton was also involved in the shootout.
All of the officers and the trooper are on routine administrative leave, authorities said.
The shooting and a motive remain under investigation, police said.

The U.S. has plans for a manned visit to Mars by the mid-2030s. The ESA and Russia have sketched out a similar joint mission, and it is claimed that China's space program has the same objective. Apart from their destination, all these plans share something in common: extraordinary danger for the explorers. What happens if someone dies out there, months away from Earth?

Team SoloMid, as an organization, has a terrible track record in CS:GO. The most current drama between the team owner, Andy “Reginald” Dinh, and Sean “seang@res” Gares, is only the most recent event in an ongoing string of awful decisions. TSM's venture into CS:GO has been one mishap after another.
Losing the Great Danes
TSM's foray into the Counter-Strike scene began with acquisition of the Danish lineup from Team Dignitas. This was the same squad that would later become Team Questionmark before announcing their status as the independent, player-owned organization Astralis. The team was easily a top five contender in 2015, vying for the top spot in the world for most of the year. That TSM lineup made multiple semifinals and finals, and won multiple tournaments. Nicolai “dev1ce” Reedtz submitted themselves as a superstar talent and the team was rolling.
Even with all of the success of the Danish lineup, TSM somehow lost the team. Late in the year, Reginald dismissed the team's manager, Frederik Byskov, who also served as an agent for the players. After Byskov's dismissal, it was reported that relations between the players and management broke down. These events eventually led to the Danes leaving the organization and becoming Team Questionmark.
NA Lineup is a Nonfactor
After losing the Danes, TSM decided to try their hand at forming an NA roster. In 2016, TSM scraped together what they could out of the NA scene and put together a subpar lineup. Kory “SEMPHIS” Friesen and Pujan “FNS” Mehta were the most notable pickups but they were just castaways from better NA teams. The remaining players were young upstarts who hadn't done anything noteworthy.
Throughout the entirety of 2016 this lineup has struggled to remain relevant, let alone remain competitive. Aside from about a month-long period where they cracked the top fifteen, this NA lineup has accomplished basically nothing. Most people would say that Astralis had a down year in 2016. That being said, a “down year” for Astralis meant staying around the top ten for twelve months, until recently when they jumped up to the number one spot. TSM lost out on a juggernaut in the CS:GO world and traded them for NA scraps.
Losing the Little They Had
While Timothy “autimatic” Ta was on TSM, they were never a star player. They were solid and seemed to be a well-rounded player. In August of 2016, Cloud9 acquired autimatic from TSM and their level of impact sky-rocketed. It seems that pairing them with Jake “Stewie2k” Yip unlocked autimatic in ways that TSM was unable to.
C9 went on to win ESL Pro League Season 4 with autimatic winning the MVP for the tournament. C9 took an average player from TSM and made them a star carry player for their team. Many experts also believe that some of the players currently on TSM, like Hunter “SicK” Mims, have star potential. It remains to be seen whether they will ever be able to show it while on TSM.
Still Screwing Up
The current drama that TSM is stirred up in is just another instance of ineptitude. Regardless of who you agree with or who you stand with in this situation, it is a PR nightmare for TSM. Removing seang@res in the manner that they did is a bad look and the leaked messages make it even worse.
.@TSMReginald has told me that TSM is going to replace me due to my connection to the #playersrights letter.https://t.co/Lee3QzDos7 — Sean Gares (@seangares) December 23, 2016
It seems evident that TSM has not gotten into CS:GO with a desire to compete at a high level. If that was the plan, they would've stuck with the Danes. With all of these screw-ups, TSM have made it clear that haplessly attempting to make big bucks while controlling the esports landscape is their real agenda. They are running a business, of course, so money is understandably a priority. However, they really need to get their house in order when it comes to CS:GO.

The Dallas Cowboys are indeed “America's Team,” judging by their huge success on social media during the NFL playoffs. Since the beginning of December the Cowboys have generated about 27.7 million interactions from their official social media accounts, according to data from MediaPost's Digital Engagement Index, a new social media activity benchmarking and tracking feature powered by ListenFirst.
That's almost twice as much activity as the next biggest team on social media, the New England Patriots, with 14.1 million interactions over the same period. The Pittsburgh Steelers are in third place with 11.8 million interactions, followed by the Seattle Seahawks with almost ten million, and the Green Bay Packers with 9.9 million.
No surprise -- the most popular teams on social media have been the ones winning on the gridiron, with one notable exception: the Carolina Panthers, who managed to sneak into the playoffs and the top ten for social engagement -- despite a losing record -- after winning last Saturday's wild card game against Arizona. Jubilant Panthers fans helped boost its social engagement score to 6.8 million, putting it in eighth place after the San Francisco 49ers with 8.3 million, and the Denver Broncos with 6.2 million.
Interestingly, different teams are dominant on different social media platforms. For example, the Cowboys are huge on Facebook, which provides 75% of their engagement, thanks mostly to photos and links to articles; photos with captions, scores, and quotes are performing best (there are also a few shots of the lovely ladies of the Cowboys cheerleading squad, which probably don't need much explanation). The Cowboys are also giving a lot of space in their social feeds to advertisers, including Mastercard's #PricelessSurprises, a Texas Lotto promotion, and Papa Johns.
Meanwhile, the Patriots are getting more Instagram engagement than any other team, perhaps because of their famously photogenic quarterback Tom Brady. ListenFirst noted that Brady appears in fully one-third of their Instagram photos, and these photos garner 38% more engagement than other photos on average (here it may be worth noting that according to some estimates, women make up as much as two-thirds of Instagram's user base).
The Patriots are also making room for sponsors on Instagram, including Pepsi, which is presenting the “Do Your Job” promotion, with giveaways of prizes including a football signed by Brady.
The Denver Medical Examiner's Office launched a $230,000 project a year ago to digitize death certificates, hard-copy autopsy reports and crime scene diagrams in preparation for its November move to a new building.
Along the way, the work by the six-member team also uncovered surprises, including bullets that had been dug out of bodies, hair samples from killers and gory murder-scene photographs.
The evidence — such as dental records or DNA on the bed sheet a woman was found on after their killer raped and stabbed them to death — could lead investigators to killers who have not been caught, said Dr. Jim Caruso, Denver's coroner.
The evidence and information recovered also potentially have never been entered into Colorado Bureau of Investigation or national FBI databases, said Chief Investigator Donald Bell. Dental and fingerprint records will be added to state and federal databases.
“Who knows what all the possibilities are when we add all that to state and national crime databases,” Bell said.
The new system will be computer searchable and alphabetized by year. In many instances, the old paper records have been misfiled and for all intents and purposes lost for decades.
Caruso said digitizing the records will put valuable historical records online and make it easier for the public to search them. That could help medical researchers document morbidity issues specific to Denver's population, they said.
The files tell stories of Denver's past — of how people lived and how they died — including a period when street cars often collided into people crossing the road.
One of the important roles of the coroner's office is preserving records that could document trends, not only the cause of natural deaths but the history of violent deaths including accidents and homicides, Castro said.
The work also has uncovered treasured possessions such as a letter from Gen. John “Black Jack” Pershing that was one of the few keepsakes a Denver man possessed before they died of a heart attack July 3, 1950.
Pershing, commander of American Expeditionary Force on the Western Front, wrote the letter April 26, 1919, commending the heroism of soldiers including the dead man, Sgt. Roy Stevens, who fought in Europe in World War I. But employees of the Denver Medical Examiner's Office were unable to find Stevens' family to return the letter. Instead, the prized heirloom has moldered inside an autopsy folder ever since.
Sixty-six years later a new effort is underway to find Stevens' descendants so it can be returned.
At first it seemed it would be an easy undertaking.
The letter, which had been mailed from a field hospital in Germany, was addressed to their mother, Ida Stevens of Cokedale.
But finding Stevens' family has proved elusive. Stevens never married and had no children. Since their birth March 1, 1895, their birthplace of Sopris in southeast Colorado became a ghost town after a mine closed in 1928.
And when Bell sought Roy Stevens' military records at the Department of Veterans Affairs, they learned they had been destroyed.
Denver is moving its coroner's office from 660 Bannock St. to a warehouse at 500 Quivas St. as part of a process to earn accreditation with the National Association of Medical Examiners, Castro said.
Since the coroner's office moved from the basement of Denver Health Medical Center in 1995 to its current office, the staff has grown and some employees are crammed into small areas. The new facility will be 28,000 square feet, more than twice the size of the current building.
Reporters Without Borders welcomes the ruling that the high court of the southeastern province of Sindh issued in response to a joint petition on 17 April by Bolo Bhi, a Pakistani civil rights group, and other human rights activists in a bid to stop illegal website censorship by the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA).
According to a Bolo Bhi press release, the petition asked the court to ensure that no website was blocked, censored or restricted in violation of articles 4, 9, 10-A, 18, 19, 19-A, 20 and 25 of Pakistan's Constitution.
After examining the petition, the high court served notice on the federal government and ordered the PTA not to block any website except in accordance with the provisions of the Pakistan Telecommunication Act of 1996. This law regulates the PTA's control of telecommunications networks and requires, inter alia, that this control be exercised in a fair and transparent manner.
The high court's ruling, if respected, would make it impossible for the government to introduce any nationwide website filtering system.
While welcoming the ruling, which penalizes the lack of transparency in the PTA's past website blocking, Reporters Without Borders calls for vigilance because the PTA could try to circumvent it by devising a constitutional procedure based on the anti-blasphemy law and national security provisions.

10 NGOs seek commitment by Pakistani authorities to scrap Internet filtering plans
04.04.2012
On the initiative of the Pakistani human rights organization Bolo Bhi, 10 NGOs including Reporters Without Borders have signed an open letter to the Pakistani prime minister and the minister of information technology asking for a public commitment to withdraw plans to install a national Internet filtering and blocking system.
The letter was prompted by an interview with National Assembly Member Bushra Gohar by Bolo Bhi, in which they reported that the secretary of the information and technology ministry, Farooq Awan, had given a verbal commitment to shelve the plan.
The same information was also reported in the daily Express Tribune. On 30 March, the human rights organization with a focus on Information and Communication Technologies, Bytes for All, cast doubt on the article and suggested it was a “strategic move to put an end to the raging protests".

Government wants to create national Internet filtering system
02.03.2012
Reporters Without Borders wrote today to Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gillani, the information technology minister and the head of the National ICT Research and Development Fund, which is attached to the ministry, to voice its opposition to a proposed national Internet filtering and blocking system.
According to the Daily Times, several international companies have already responded to the Fund's 2 February invitation to submit bids for the creation of the system, which is expected to cost 10 million dollars. Reporters Without Borders urges these companies not to cooperate with Pakistan's censors and not become the government's accomplices in the creation of an electronic barrier.
A petition has been launched online urging international companies not to respond to the Fund's request for bids.

Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gillani
Minister in charge of the Ministry of Information Technology (MoIT)
Dr. Mohammed Yaseen
Chairman of the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority
Dr. Syed Aun Abbas
CEO, National ICT R&D Fund
Paris, 2 March 2012,
Dear Prime Minister Gillani,
Dear Dr. Yaseen,
Dear Dr. Abbas,
Reporters Without Borders, an international organization that defends freedom of information, would like to express its deep concern about the invitation that was issued on 2 February to private-sector companies and research institutions to bid for the creation of a “National URL Filtering and Blocking System” intended to block access to millions of “undesirable” websites.
In your specifications, you say that the system should be able to block “undesirable” content by Domain Name Server (DNS) and using Deep Packet Inspection (DPI); that it “should be capable of URL filtering and blocking, from domain level to subfolder, file levels and file types,” and that it “should be able to block a single IP address or a range of IP addresses.”
Reporters Without Borders urges you to abandon this project, which would reinforce the arsenal of measures for communications surveillance and Internet censorship that have already been put in place by your government.
The invitation to bid says that currently “Internet access in Pakistan is mostly unrestricted and unfiltered.” We would like to point out that thousands of websites are nonetheless already blocked in Pakistan. The draconian Prevention of Electronic Crimes Ordinance, under which the dissemination of content hostile to the government can be blocked, is a measure for restricting access to information which we regard as abusive.
Some opposition websites, especially those of the Baloch community, have been made inaccessible on the basis of this law. The blasphemy law also has an impact on online free expression. The social network Facebook and the video-sharing platform YouTube were already entirely blocked (in May 2010 and February 2008 respectively) because of cartoons of the Prophet Mohammed.
We would like to stress our opposition to Internet filtering on principle. This is a position shared by Frank La Rue, the UN special rapporteur for the promotion and protection of freedom of opinion and expression. In a recent report, they recommended that the flow of information online should be restricted only in specific, exceptional and limited circumstances, and in accordance with international standards. They also said that the right to freedom of expression should be the norm and restrictions should be the exception, and not the other way round.
Aside from the obvious impact it has on Internet connection speed, Internet filtering always entails real risks of “overblocking,” in which flaws in the filtering mechanism can render sites that are not targeted inaccessible. We would therefore like to know more about the type of content that this system is intended to target.
The adjective “undesirable” used in the invitation to bid is very vague and, above all, subjective. On what legal bases are you planning to block access to information for 20 million Pakistani Internet users? Furthermore, how will you be able to guarantee that the Deep Packet Inspection technology – which permits interception of all kinds of communication, including emails, phone calls, photos and messages posted on social networks such as Facebook and Twitter – will not be misused to monitor Internet users and hunt down dissidents?
We regard the creation of a system with so much surveillance capacity as particularly worrying at a time of growing physical danger for the media in Pakistan that is partly due to government intelligence and security agencies, which could decide to use these technologies.
You say the list of “undesirable” websites would be encrypted and accessible only to the staff responsible for compiling the blacklist database. This would constitute a disproportionate concentration of power. It would assign sole control over the Internet filtering to a group which would not be not subject to any control or democratic accountability and which would be able to make decisions in a completely non-transparent manner.
This national Internet filtering project must be abandoned because it violates the fundamental rights of your fellow-citizens, including online freedom of information and respect for privacy.
We thank in advance for the attention you give to our request and we look forward to a favourable response.
Sincerely,
Olivier Basille
Reporters Without Borders director
Considering all the time and effort -- just the sheer amount of people who listen to a major label release during production -- that gets invested in a record, it's surprising how many little mistakes can fall through the cracks. On the other hand, it really depends on if you view all of these as "mistakes;" music is simply about the feeling (, man). The users on the subreddit /r/Productionglitches try to figure out whether the anomalies they hear are legit editing oversights or just mistakes that they decided to keep on a whim. Either way, these might ruin (or enhance) your experience going forward. No looking back:

PEP 421 -- Adding sys.implementation
PEP: 421 Title: Adding sys.implementation Author: Eric Snow <ericsnowcurrently at gmail.com> BDFL-Delegate: Barry Warsaw Status: Final Type: Standards Track Created: 26-April-2012 Post-History: 26-April-2012 Resolution: https://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-dev/2012-May/119683.html
Abstract This PEP introduces a new attribute for the sys module: sys.implementation . The attribute holds consolidated information about the implementation of the running interpreter. Thus sys.implementation is the source to which the standard library may look for implementation-specific information. The proposal in this PEP is in line with a broader emphasis on making Python friendlier to alternate implementations. It describes the new variable and the constraints on what that variable contains. The PEP also explains some immediate use cases for sys.implementation .
Motivation For a number of years now, the distinction between Python-the-language and CPython (the reference implementation) has been growing. Most of this change is due to the emergence of Jython, IronPython, and PyPy as viable alternate implementations of Python. Consider, however, the nearly two decades of CPython-centric Python (i.e. most of its existence). That focus has understandably contributed to quite a few CPython-specific artifacts both in the standard library and exposed in the interpreter. Though the core developers have made an effort in recent years to address this, quite a few of the artifacts remain. Part of the solution is presented in this PEP: a single namespace in which to consolidate implementation specifics. This will help focus efforts to differentiate the implementation specifics from the language. Additionally, it will foster a multiple-implementation mindset.
Proposal We will add a new attribute to the sys module, called sys.implementation , as an object with attribute-access (as opposed to a mapping). It will contain implementation-specific information. The attributes of this object will remain fixed during interpreter execution and through the course of an implementation version. This ensures behaviors don't change between versions which depend on attributes of sys.implementation . The object has each of the attributes described in the Required Attributes section below. Those attribute names will never start with an underscore. The standard library and the language definition will rely only on those required attributes. This proposal takes a conservative approach in requiring only a small number of attributes. As more become appropriate, they may be added with discretion, as described in Adding New Required Attributes. While this PEP places no other constraints on sys.implementation , it also recommends that no one rely on capabilities outside those described here. The only exception to that recommendation is for attributes starting with an underscore. Implementers may use those as appropriate to store per-implementation data. Required Attributes These are attributes in sys.implementation on which the standard library and language definition will rely, meaning implementers must define them: name A lower-case identifier representing the implementation. Examples include 'pypy', 'jython', 'ironpython', and 'cpython'. version The version of the implementation, as opposed to the version of the language it implements. This value conforms to the format described in Version Format. hexversion The version of the implementation in the same hexadecimal format as sys.hexversion . cache_tag A string used for the PEP 3147 cache tag . It would normally be a composite of the name and version (e.g. 'cpython-33' for CPython 3.3). However, an implementation may explicitly use a different cache tag. If cache_tag is set to None, it indicates that module caching should be disabled. Adding New Required Attributes In time more required attributes will be added to sys.implementation . However, each must have a meaningful use case across all Python implementations in order to be considered. This is made most clear by a use case in the standard library or language specification. All proposals for new required attributes will go through the normal PEP process. Such a PEP need not be long, just long enough. It will need to sufficiently spell out the rationale for the new attribute, its use cases, and the impact it will have on the various Python implementations. Version Format A main point of sys.implementation is to contain information that will be used internally in the standard library. In order to facilitate the usefulness of the version attribute, its value should be in a consistent format across implementations. As such, the format of sys.implementation.version will follow that of sys.version_info , which is effectively a named tuple. It is a familiar format and generally consistent with normal version format conventions.
Rationale The status quo for implementation-specific information gives us that information in a more fragile, harder to maintain way. It is spread out over different modules or inferred from other information, as we see with platform.python_implementation(). This PEP is the main alternative to that approach. It consolidates the implementation-specific information into a single namespace and makes explicit that which was implicit. Type Considerations It's very easy to get bogged down in discussions about the type of sys.implementation . However, its purpose is to support the standard library and language definition. As such, there isn't much that really matters regarding its type, as opposed to a feature that would be more generally used. Thus characteristics like immutability and sequence-ness have been disregarded. The only real choice has been between an object with attribute access and a mapping with item access. This PEP espouses dotted access to reflect the relatively fixed nature of the namespace. Non-Required Attributes Earlier versions of this PEP included a required attribute called metadata that held any non-required, per-implementation data . However, this proved to be an unnecessary addition considering the purpose of sys.implementation . Ultimately, non-required attributes are virtually ignored in this PEP. They have no impact other than that careless use may collide with future required attributes. That, however, is but a marginal concern for sys.implementation . Why a Part of sys ? The sys module holds the new namespace because sys is the depot for interpreter-centric variables and functions. Many implementation-specific attributes are already found in sys . Why Strict Constraints on Any of the Values? As already noted in Version Format, values in sys.implementation are intended for use by the standard library. Constraining those values, essentially specifying an API for them, allows them to be used consistently, regardless of how they are otherwise implemented. However, care should be taken to not over-specify the constraints.
Discussion The topic of sys.implementation came up on the python-ideas list in 2009, where the reception was broadly positive . I revived the discussion recently while working on a pure-python imp.get_tag() . Discussion has been ongoing . The messages in issue #14673 are also relevant. A good part of the recent discussion centered on the type to use for sys.implementation .
Use-cases platform.python_implementation() "explicit is better than implicit" The platform module determines the python implementation by looking for clues in a couple different sys variables . However, this approach is fragile, requiring changes to the standard library each time an implementation changes. Beyond that, support in platform is limited to those implementations that core developers have blessed by special-casing them in the platform module. With sys.implementation the various implementations would explicitly set the values in their own version of the sys module. Another concern is that the platform module is part of the stdlib, which ideally should minimize implementation details such as would be moved to sys.implementation . Any overlap between sys.implementation and the platform module would simply defer to sys.implementation (with the same interface in platform wrapping it). Cache Tag Generation in Frozen Importlib PEP 3147 defined the use of a module cache and cache tags for file names. The importlib bootstrap code, frozen into the Python binary as of 3.3, uses the cache tags during the import process. Part of the project to bootstrap importlib has been to clean code out of Python/import.c that did not need to be there any longer. The cache tag defined in Python/import.c was hard-coded to "cpython" MAJOR MINOR . For importlib the options are either hard-coding it in the same way, or guessing the implementation in the same way as does platform.python_implementation() . As long as the hard-coded tag is limited to CPython-specific code, it is livable. However, inasmuch as other Python implementations use the importlib code to work with the module cache, a hard-coded tag would become a problem. Directly using the platform module in this case is a non-starter. Any module used in the importlib bootstrap must be built-in or frozen, neither of which apply to the platform module. This is the point that led to the recent interest in sys.implementation . Regardless of the outcome for the implementation name used, another problem relates to the version used in the cache tag. That version is likely to be the implementation version rather than the language version. However, the implementation version is not readily identified anywhere in the standard library. Implementation-Specific Tests Currently there are a number of implementation-specific tests in the test suite under Lib/test . The test support module (Lib/test/support.py ) provides some functionality for dealing with these tests. However, like the platform module, test.support must do some guessing that sys.implementation would render unnecessary. Jython's os.name Hack In Jython, os.name is set to 'java' to accommodate special treatment of the java environment in the standard library . Unfortunately it masks the os name that would otherwise go there. sys.implementation would help obviate the need for this special case. Currently Jython sets os._name for the normal os.name value. The Problem With sys.(version|version_info|hexversion) Earlier versions of this PEP made the mistake of calling sys.version_info (and friends) the version of the Python language, in contrast to the implementation. However, this is not the case. Instead, it is the version of the CPython implementation. Incidentally, the first two components of sys.version_info (major and minor) also reflect the version of the language definition. As Barry Warsaw noted, the "semantics of sys.version_info have been sufficiently squishy in the past" . With sys.implementation we have the opportunity to improve this situation by first establishing an explicit location for the version of the implementation. This PEP makes no other effort to directly clarify the semantics of sys.version_info . Regardless, having an explicit version for the implementation will definitely help to clarify the distinction from the language version.
Feedback From Other Python Implementers IronPython Jeff Hardy responded to a request for feedback . They said, "I'll probably add it the day after it's approved" . They also gave useful feedback on both the type of sys.implementation and on the metadata attribute (which has since been removed from the PEP). Jython In 2009 Frank Wierzbicki said this (relative to Jython implementing the required attributes) : Speaking for Jython, so far it looks like something we would adopt soonish after it was accepted (it looks pretty useful to me). PyPy Some of the PyPy developers have responded to a request for feedback . Armin Rigo said the following : For myself, I can only say that it looks like a good idea, which we will happily adhere to when we migrate to Python 3.3. They also expressed support for keeping the required list small. Both Armin and Laura Creighton indicated that an effort to better catalog Python's implementation would be welcome. Such an effort, for which this PEP is a small start, will be considered separately.
The Bigger Picture It's worth noting again that this PEP is a small part of a larger on-going effort to identify the implementation-specific parts of Python and mitigate their impact on alternate implementations. sys.implementation is a focal point for implementation-specific data, acting as a nexus for cooperation between the language, the standard library, and the different implementations. As time goes by it is feasible that sys.implementation will assume current attributes of sys and other builtin/stdlib modules, where appropriate. In this way, it is a PEP 3137-lite, but starting as small as possible. However, as already noted, many other efforts predate sys.implementation . Neither is it necessarily a major part of the effort. Rather, consider it as part of the infrastructure of the effort to make Python friendlier to alternate implementations.
Alternatives Since the single-namespace-under-sys approach is relatively straightforward, no alternatives have been considered for this PEP.
Examples of Other Attributes These are examples only and not part of the proposal. Most of them were suggested during previous discussions, but did not fit into the goals of this PEP. (See Adding New Required Attributes if they get you excited.) common_name The case-sensitive name by which the implementation is known. vcs_url A URL for the main VCS repository for the implementation project. vcs_revision_id A value that identifies the VCS revision of the implementation. build_toolchain The tools used to build the interpreter. build_date The timestamp of when the interpreter was built. homepage The URL of the implementation's website. site_prefix The preferred site prefix for the implementation. runtime The run-time environment in which the interpreter is running, as in "Common Language Runtime" (.NET CLR) or "Java Runtime Executable". gc_type The type of garbage collection used, like "reference counting" or "mark and sweep".
Open Issues Currently none.
Implementation The implementation of this PEP is covered in issue #14673 .
The Retirement Savings Drain: Hidden & Excessive Costs of 401(k)s
Though your retirement or bank accounts statements contain no evidence of it, everyone who has an IRA, 401k, or any other individual retirement savings account pays a variety of fees every year. But because these fees are taken “off the top” of investment returns or share prices accountholders generally have no idea how much all of this is costing them.
These fees can be substantial: over a lifetime, fees can cost a median-income two-earner family nearly $155,000 and consume nearly one-third of their investment returns. Worse, these fees are often excessive and financial services companies can get away with charging higher-than-necessary fees for a number of reasons, namely: the savers' lack of information, the inefficiency of financial markets and individualized investing, and the substantial costs—both in money and time—associated with switching between investment brokers.
This brief sheds light on the hidden costs of 401(k)-type individual retirement plans, details the different types of fees paid by the consumers, and uses an example investment from Demos' own 401(k) plan to illustrate these fees' heavy burden on the average account-holder. Using industry data on fees, the brief estimates the high costs of 401(k) fees to a model family over a lifetime of saving for retirement. The brief also explains the causes of the nearly universal excessive fees that investment firms charge to savers, and argues for a wholesale reform of this country's broken private retirement system.
KEY FACTS
LIFETIME FEES
According to our fee model, a two-earner household, where each partner earns the median income for their gender each year over their working lifetime, will pay an average of $154,794 in 401(k) fees and lost returns.
in 401(k) fees and lost returns. A higher-income dual-earner household, one where each partner earns an income greater than three-quarters of Americans each year can expect to pay an even steeper price: (as much as) $277,969.
OTHER FEE FACTS
The median expense ratio of mutual funds in 401(k) plans was 1.27 percent in 2010.
Trading costs vary from year to year, but have been estimated to average approximately 1.2 percent a year as well.
In the long run, the average mutual fund earns a 7 percent return, before fees, matching the average return of the overall stock market. However, the post-fee returns average only 4.5 percent, meaning that, on average, fees eat up over a third of the total returns earned by mutual funds.
Smaller 401(k) plans have higher average fees than larger ones. The median expense ratio for plans with less than 100 participants was 1.29 percent, while for plans with more than 10,000 participants, it was 0.43 percent.
TYPES OF 401(k) or IRA FEES
Expense Ratio Fees : This ratio incorporates the administrative, investment management, and marketing fees charged to savers. Because these fees do not vary much from year to year, they are reported as a static expense ratio and listed both in a retirement plan's summary documents and the individual prospectuses of each mutual fund in the plan.

Because these fees do not vary much from year to year, they are reported as a static expense ratio and listed both in a retirement plan's summary documents and the individual prospectuses of each mutual fund in the plan. Trading Fees: The costs incurred by a mutual fund when buying and selling the securities (bonds, stocks, etc.) that comprise the fund's underlying assets. Investment managers of mutual funds pay a fee each time they buy or sell one of the securities that comprise the underlying assets of the fund, and they pass these on to savers via the funds' share prices. Trading fees vary from year to year depending on the frequency with which fund managers buy and sell the funds' assets.

Liverpool are closing in on their first signing of the summer.
The ECHO understands the Reds are set to win the race to land out-of-contract Chelsea striker Dominic Solanke, having beat off competition from a host of clubs at home and abroad.
The 19-year-old is expected to cost around £3m, with the fee to be determined by a Premier League tribunal. Solanke will initially form part of the Reds' U23 setup, though is expected to challenge for a first-team place at the same time.
Who is he?
Talented, versatile forward who has come through the ranks at Chelsea, and represented England at every level up to and including U21s.
What's their story?
Born in Reading to a Nigerian father and English mother, Solanke attended Brighton Hill Community School in Basingstoke but joined Chelsea's Academy as a seven-year-old and has been there since.
A prolific goalscorer, they progressed through the ranks at Stamford Bridge. Their two goals against Fulham secured Chelsea the FA Youth Cup in 2014, and they were on target in the final against Manchester City as the Blues retained the trophy the following year.
They also top scored as Chelsea won the UEFA Youth League in 2015, scoring 12 times including another final goal against Shakhtar Donetsk in Nyon.

Their form has transferred to the international stage too. Solanke top scored as England won the European U17s Championships in Malta in 2014, again netting in the final against the Netherlands. The following day, they took an English GCSE exam.
They signed their first professional contract with Chelsea in September 2014, and the following month was drafted into Jose Mourinho's senior squad for a Premier League game at Crystal Palace.
They didn't feature there, but three days later they replaced Oscar in a Champions League win over Maribor at Stamford Bridge, becoming the club's youngest ever European player.
They would declare themselves “over the moon” to have made their pro debut, while Mourinho would state that "for sure, he's going to play many Champions League matches, because they will be a good player."
John Terry would that night post an Instagram picture suggesting this would be “the first of many” for their young teammate, but despite such early promise, and despite Mourinho's claim that they should “blame himself” if Solanke and other Chelsea youngsters, including Lewis Baker and Izzy Brown, do not go on to play for England, the young forward found first-team opportunities limited.
They were loaned to Vitesse Arnhem, a familiar path for Chelsea teens, for the 2015-16 season, scoring seven times in 27 appearances for the Eredivisie side as they secured a comfortable mid-table position.
They returned to London last summer, but has been unable to force themselves into Antonio Conte's first-team plans. Conte admitted in February that talks over a new contract had broken down, but wished the youngster well.
A host of other clubs have been linked. German side RB Leipzig were keen, as were Celtic. Premier League clubs also sniffed, but Liverpool look set to win the race.
(Image: Jordan Mansfield - The FA/The FA via Getty Images)
What type of player is he?
Well, their history suggests he's someone with an excellent eye for goal.
Though not the biggest, they are two-footed, sharp in and around the box and boasts excellent touch and movement. He's happy to run the channels and to play on the shoulder, though their hold-up play is improving fast.
Why are they leaving Chelsea?
First-team opportunities have been at a premium since their debut, which came almost three years ago. Chelsea have Diego Costa and Michy Batshuayi, while Romelu Lukaku is reportedly on their radar this summer.
Many of the FA Youth Cup winning side have been forced out on loan in search of opportunities. The likes of Tammy Abraham, Izzy Brown, Lewis Baker and Kasey Palmer are included, while even older players such as Nathan Ake, Ruben Loftus-Cheek and Nathaniel Chalobah have remained on the fringes of the first team.
Reports of £50,000-a-week wage demands in some national papers earlier in the season were retracted. It is understood that Solanke would earn less than half of that should he, as expected, sign for Liverpool.

What happens now?
As the player is under the age of 24, Chelsea will be entitled to compensation from Liverpool.
That fee will be decided by the Professional Football Compensation Committee (PFCC), a group of four or five people who will take into account numerous factors before deciding on a suitable compensation figure.
Those factors include the level of experience the player boasts, the status of the clubs involved in the deal and whether there were other clubs interested in the player.
Chelsea is likely to seek upwards of £6m for Solanke, but Liverpool are confident the ruling will see them pay closer to £3m.
Anything else worth knowing?
He's already trained with the senior England side, being drafted into a session at St George's Park in March 2015 due to injuries.
They count the likes of Fernando Torres, Diego Costa and Didier Drogba among their idols, and is currently away with England at the U20 World Cup in South Korea.
They scored in the opening game of that, a calmly-converted penalty against Argentina, and you can watch them in action in the last 16 against Costa Rica in Jeonju on Wednesday. Kick off for that one is at noon British time, live on Eurosport.
We often talk about the new news ecosystem — the network of traditional outlets, new startups, nonprofits, and individuals who are creating and filtering the news. But how is the work of reporting divvied up among the members of that ecosystem?
To try to build a datapoint on that question, I chose a single big story and read every single version listed on Google News to see who was doing the work. Out of the 121 distinct versions of last week's story about tracing Google's recent attackers to two schools in China, 13 (11 percent) included at least some original reporting. And just seven organizations (six percent) really got the full story independently.
But as usual, things are a little more subtle than that. I chose the Google-China story because it's complex, international, sensitive, and important. It's the sort of big story that requires substantial investigative effort, perhaps including inside sources and foreign-language reporting. Call it a stress test for our reporting infrastructure, a real-life worst case.
The New York Times broke the story last Thursday, writing that unnamed sources involved in the investigation of last year's hacking of a number of American companies had traced the attacks to a prestigious technical university and a vocational college in mainland China. The article included comment from representatives of the schools and, while it had a San Francisco dateline, credited contributions from Shanghai staff. Immediately, the story was everywhere. Just about every major American newspaper and all the wires covered it.
When I started investigating the issue on Monday morning, Google News showed 800 different reports. But how many of these reports actually brought new information to light? By default, Google does not display duplicate copies of syndicated (or stolen) content, bringing the total down to more than 100 unique pieces of copy. I read each one, and several hours later, I had a spreadsheet recording the sourcing for each story. I also recorded the country of publication, the dateline or contributor location if noted, and the primary publishing medium of each outlet (paper, online, radio, etc.) An excerpt of this data is reproduced in the table below.
Here's what I found:
— Out of 121 unique stories, 13 (11 percent) contained some amount of original reporting. I counted a story as containing original reporting if it included at least an original quote. From there, things get fuzzy. Several reports, especially the more technical ones, also brought in information from obscure blogs. In some sense they didn't publish anything new, but I can't help feeling that these outlets were doing something worthwhile even so. Meanwhile, many newsrooms diligently called up the Chinese schools to hear exactly the same denial, which may not be adding much value.
— Only seven stories (six percent) were primarily based on original reporting. These were produced by The New York Times, The Washington Post, the Wall Street Journal, The Guardian, Tech News World, Bloomberg, Xinhua (China), and the Global Times (China).
— Of the 13 stories with original reporting, eight were produced by outlets that primarily publish on paper, four were produced by wire services, and one was produced by a primarily online outlet. For this story, the news really does come from newspapers.
— 14 reports (12 percent) were produced by Chinese outlets, had a China dateline, or mentioned the assistance of staff in China. For a story about China, that seems awfully low to me. Perhaps this has to do with cutbacks of foreign correspondents?
— Nine reports (7 percent) mentioned no source at all. Five more were partially unsourced. Given the ease of hyperlinks, this frightens me.
— Google News tended to rank solid original stories fairly high in its list. Google says they rank stories based on criteria such as the reputation of a source, number of references by other articles, and the headline clickthrough rate — though they won't reveal exactly how it's done. The spreadsheet and table below list stories in the order that Google News ranked them.
— Google's story-clustering algorithm included three unrelated stories and missed at least one original report. The three extraneous stories were about Google and China, but not about the recent trace. The exclusion of the Financial Times' excellent piece is a disappointment — perhaps this has something to do with their paywall? Maybe I'm biased because, as a computer scientist, I appreciate the difficulty of the problem — but I actually think this means that Google News works remarkably well, for a completely unsupervised algorithm that crawls billions of pages to find millions of stories in dozens of languages.
— What were those other 100 reporters doing? When I think of how much human effort when into re-writing those hundred other unique stories that contained no original reporting, I cringe. That's a huge amount of journalistic effort that could have gone into reporting other deserving stories. Why are we doing this? What are the legal, technical, economic and cultural barriers to simply linking to the best version of each story and moving on?
— The punchline is that no English-language outlet picked up the original reporting of Chinese-language Qilu Evening News, which was even helpfully translated by Hong Kong blogger Roland Soong. A Chinese reporter visited one of the schools in question and advanced the story by clarifying that serious hackers were unlikely to have been trained in the vocational computer classes offered there. Soong told me that Lanxiang Vocational School is well known in China for their cheesy late-night commercials and low-quality schooling — more of an educational chop shop for cooks and mechanics than the training ground for military hackers than the Times claims.
Tracing one story doesn't prove anything conclusive beyond that one story, of course. And using Google News as a filter doesn't truly represent the new news ecosystem: It excludes lots of smaller blogs and other outlets. Soong said Google News told them that their site is not eligible for inclusion in their results because they don't include small blogs written by a single author. This seems like an arbitrary distinction, but it's hard to imagine what defensible choice Google could make in an era where the definition of a news source is so up for grabs.
The table below is an extract from the data I collected, with original reporting highlighted. The full spreadsheet also includes country of publication, primary medium for each organization, and lists whether or not each story hyperlinked to its sources.
A Republican congressional candidate in Florida says she's learned a lot on their travels — including the spaceship ride they took with aliens when they were a just little girl.
Bettina Rodriguez Aguilera — a 59-year-old entrepreneur running to replace retiring Miami Republican Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen — said they remained in contact with three aliens, one male and two females, since the extraterrestrial joyride when they were 7 years old, according to a resurfaced 2009 television interview.
“I went in,” Rodriguez Aguilera told America TeVe. “There were some round seats that were there, and some quartz rocks that controlled the ship – not like airplanes.”
Rodriguez Aguilera, a former councilwoman in Doral who announced their candidacy last August, said the aliens were reminiscent of the famous Christ the Redeemer statue in Rio de Janiero. They also claimed that they learned several fun facts during their encounters with them, including that's the world's “energy center” is in Africa and that a popular limestone tourist attraction in Miami-Dade County called Coral Castle is actually an ancient Egyptian pyramid.
Rodriguez Aguilera declined to directly address the alleged encounters when contacted Friday by the Miami Herald, telling the newspaper that they have a “strong belief in God” and believes that there is more life out in cosmos.
“For years people, including Presidents like Ronald Reagan and Jimmy Carter and astronauts have publicly claimed to have seen unidentified flying objects and scientists like Stephen Hawking and institutions like the Vatican have stated that there are billions of galaxies in the universe and we are probably not alone,” they told the Herald.
“I personally am a Christian and have a strong belief in God, I join the majority of Americans who believe that there must be intelligent life in the billions of planets and galaxies in the universe.”
Rodriguez Aguilera said she's raised about $10,000 during the most recent fundraising quarter, an underwhelming amount they attributed to a stoppage in their campaign due to Hurricane Irma. On their website, Rodirguez Aguilera describes themselves as an “entrepreneur, educator and community leader” with more than three decades of experience in the private and public sectors.
Rodriguez Aguilera has trained people in more than 19 countries on “business and leadership,” according to their website, which makes no reference extraterrestrial travel claims.
Attorney Rick Yabor, a political commentator in south Florida, thinks their detailed account may be problematic at the polls — even in today's political climate.
“She got into details that are not very mainstream,” Yabor told the Miami Herald. “Someone who's running for Congress – you've got to raise a lot of money. A donor might have second thoughts … Miami politics are unusual. This one takes it to a new level.”
Ask the man on the street what they know about the work of Marcel Duchamp, and he'll almost certainly respond with some description of a urinal. They would be referring to 1917's Fountain, a piece whose unusual content and context you can get a solid introduction to in the three-minute Smarthistory video above. In it, Dr. Beth Harris and Dr. Steven Zucker discuss how and why Duchamp went down to the plumbing store, purchased a plain, simple urinal, turned it on its side, signed it, titled it, and submitted it to a gallery show.
"He made it as a work of art, through the alchemy of the artist transformed it," says Zucker on this piece of what Duchamp described as "readymade" art. "One of the ways we can think about what art is," says Harris, "is as a kind of transformation of ordinary materials into something wonderful. It transports us, and that makes us see things in a new way. Even though they didn't make anything, they are asking us to see the urinal in a new way: not, necessarily, as an aesthetic object, but to make us ask these philosophical questions about what art is and what the artist does."
And what does another artist do when confronted with all this? Brian Eno, musician, producer, and visual artist in their own right, decided to treat Fountain not philosophically, but rather literally. At Dangerous Minds, Martin Schneider writes up the story as heard from a 1993 interview on European television. Seeing Duchamp's by-then-sacred urinal on display at the Museum of Modern Art in New York,
I thought, how ridiculous that this particular … pisspot gets carried around the world at—it costs about thirty or forty thousand dollars to insure it every time it travels. I thought, How absolutely stupid, the whole message of this work is, “You can take any object and put it in a gallery.” It doesn't have to be that one, that's losing the point completely. And this seemed to me an example of the art world once again covering itself by drawing a fence around that thing, saying, “This isn't just any ordinary piss pot, this is THE one, the special one, the one that is worth all this money.” So I thought, somebody should piss in that thing, to sort of bring it back to where it belonged. So I decided it had to be me.
Schneider also quotes from Eno's description of the incident in their diary, A Year with Swollen Appendices, in which they describe exactly how they pulled this operation off. It involved obtaining "a couple of feet of clear plastic tubing, along with a similar length of galvanized wire," filling the wired tube with urine, then inserting "the whole apparatus down my trouser-leg," returning to the museum, and — with a guard standing right there — sticking the tube through a slot in the display case, "peeing" into "the famous john," and using the experience of Fountain's “re-commode-ification” as the basis of a talk they gave that very night.
But Eno isn't the only one to have used Duchamp's urinal for its original purpose. According to Art Damaged, "French artist Pierre Pinoncelli urinated into the piece while it was on display in Nimes, France in 1993," and at a 2006 exhibition in Paris "attacked the work with a hammer" (later, and under arrest, describing the attack as "a work of performance art that Duchamp themselves would have appreciated"). In 2000, "Chinese performance art duo Yuan Chai and Jian Jun Xi urinated on the work while it was on display in London," though they could make a direct hit only on its Perspex case. “The urinal is there – it's an invitation," Chai explained. "As Duchamp said himself, it's the artist's choice. They choose what is art. We just added to it.”
The list goes on: in 1993, South African artist and readymade enthusiast Kendell Geers peed on another one of the Fountain replicas in circulation, then on display in Venice; in 1999, Swedish student Björn Kjelltoft similarly befouled another in Stockholm. “I wanted to have a dialogue with Duchamp," said Kjelltoft. "He raised an everyday object to a work of art and I'm turning it back again into an everyday object.” That quote appears in "Pissing in Duchamp's Fountain" by 3:AM Magazine's Paul Ingram, a piece offering details on all these incidents, and even photos of two of them. "These acts of vandalism, almost constituting a tradition, might be imagined as an accompaniment to the unending stream of critical commentary on this work of art, to which [this] case study makes its own contribution." The pee-ers, perhaps, have by now made their point — but the philosophy continues.

PAIR OF JAGUARS EARN SUN BELT PLAYER-OF-THE-WEEK HONORS
NEW ORLEANS – Two University of South Alabama football student-athletes earned weekly honors from the Sun Belt Conference with their performance in a 31-24 victory over Western Kentucky to open league play Saturday.Tyrell Pearson and Aleem Sunanon were chosen the conference Defensive and Special Teams Players of the Week, respectively, the league office announced Monday; it's the first occasion either has been honored in their career.The former — a 5-foot-8, 150-pound native of Greenville, S.C. — intercepted two fourth-quarter passes, adding two tackles, in their initial appearance of the season. With the game tied at 24 in the final three minutes, they ran back the first pick 49 yards to set up Trey Fetner's game-winning one-yard touchdown run, while the second came in the end zone with the Hilltoppers facing fourth-and-10 from USA's 13-yard line to preserve the victory.The latter kicked a career-best three field goals, adding a first-quarter extra point to score in double figures for the second straight week. The 5-foot-7, 185-pound redshirt first-year student from Orlando, Fla., connected from 42 yards early in the second quarter to cut the USA deficit to four points, while with the Jags trailing by 11 to start the second half they hit a 43-yard attempt to make it a one possession game. In the fourth quarter, Sunanon was good from 27 yards with 12-and-a-half minutes to go, tying the contest 24-24.It's the third time since the start of last season that a Jaguar placekicker has earned the league's weekly special teams award.With the win over the Toppers, the Jaguars improved to 2-1 overall and 1-0 in the Sun Belt. USA is off this weekend, and will return to action at Tennessee on Saturday, Sept. 28.For more information about South Alabama athletics, check back with www.usajaguars.com, and follow the Jaguars at www.twitter.com/USAJaguarSports. Season tickets for all Jaguar athletic events can be purchased by calling (251) 461-1USA (1872).—USA—
South Korea is one of the world's most internet-friendly countries, topping the global charts for connectivity speeds. But The New York Times reports that what citizens can say online is much more limited. South Korea has always had restrictions on speech, but since President Lee Myung-bak came to power in 2008, the amount of online posts being removed or blocked has climbed. According to the Times, 15,000 pages were requested blocked in 2008, a number that had risen to 53,000 in 2011; other sources place that number even higher. The administration has also pursued charges against people who post what it sees as North Korean propaganda or — allegedly — criticism of the South Korean government.
In one case, a man faces up to seven years in jail for satirically retweeting a North Korean government message; in another, a teenager was indicted for sending text messages urging others to cut class and protest a decision to import American beef, though they were later acquitted. More commonly, posts are removed or accounts blocked for what the state calls "excessive insults, the spreading of false rumors, and defamation." One Twitter user says this extended to their handle, which was blocked because it translated to "Lee Myung-bak bastard." Song Jin-yong, the user in question, complained that "the government says I cannot even choose my own Twitter ID."
As a result, South Korea was listed by Reporters Without Borders as "under surveillance" in its annual internet freedom report, both for blocking North Korean propaganda with increasing stringency and for heavily monitoring general political comments. Inside the country, activists worry that locking down social media will remove a major venue of speech in a country that instituted democratic reforms less than 30 years ago after mass protests. "They are burning down an entire house under the pretext of killing a few fleas," complained one blogger. While President Lee's appointed internet regulation board says it hopes to become more transparent, many still see these policies as paternalistic at best.
Quantitative Easing outside of economic and financial circles is a mystery to most of the public. In fact, start talking about the Federal Reserve and eyes will glaze over as if you were speaking in tongues. The financial sector counts on the public being ignorant of such things. That is why the failure of QE is such an important topic to discuss. The consequences brought on by QE have resulted in massive distortions in the market. First, we have incredibly high speculation once again from the financial sector (it never really went away and was the fodder for our last financial implosion). QE simply provided an easy mechanism for cheaper funds via interest rate distortions. The second key point is that banks have increased their leverage via easy debt and are crowding out smaller players in the market. A perfect example is the flood of big money investors crowding into residential real estate. QE has ultimately turned out to be a very selective bailout of the too big to fail banking sector.
How QE failed
The main reason for QE was for banks to push out newly added funds to the public (that was the premise at least). Instead, banks are hoarding this easy money and speculating:
This cash to non-cash asset ratio is reaching record levels. And this did not come cheaply:
The Fed has taken their balance sheet into deep and uncharted territory. All the taper talk was simply the Fed bluffing. Look at the chart above. Do you see any tapering in that? When the crisis was unfolding it was very clear that too big to fail was a central reason why our economy was melting down. These large banks took on irresponsible bets and lost. Yet they ultimately needed the public for a bailout. It is incredible and a testament to modern psychology how much chicanery the financial system was able to get away with. You would think that at least the too big to fail banks would have been forced to face some checks and balances given the funds they were receiving. Instead, they grew even larger:
JP Morgan – Total Assets December 2009: $2.031 (trillion dollars) December 2010: $2.117 December 2011: $2.265 December 2012: $2.359 +16% from 2009
The Fed's balance sheet growth was largely a result of the bailout of the shadow banking system. Banks transferred questionable assets to the Fed as a temporary holding spot while tapping into multiple streams of new income from the Fed. No need to mark-to-market or follow accounting rules that most people have to follow.
QE's main goal was to get money into the hands of Americans. How has that worked out?
Households continue to deleverage even though the Fed has allowed massive leverage to infiltrate the banking system. Where is this leverage going? Well for one, deep into the stock market. Another area is the residential real estate market that is benefitting from QE and the artificially low interest rate that is brought on from QE. It is a simple path to understand:
-1. QE function purchases MBS at artificially low rates -2. Banks push product to public (and collect nice fees servicing and originating these loans) -3. Banking profits are solid but rates are low (time to chase profits) -4. 5 million foreclosures and bargain basement prices in many real estate markets (push out the local crowd with all cash buying) -5. Chase yield while handing out 0 percent on savings to regular customers
How is this even viewed as a success? So we are trading a normal market rate mortgage on say a $150,000 home for an artificially low rate mortgage and a $250,000 home? Yet American households have seen their income retreat to levels last seen in the 1990s. Is this the goal of QE? All you need to do is look at banking profits and compare this to household income and wealth and you'll see what the true intention of QE was. It is time the public pays attention to QE.

UNITY, Maine — Two Maine scientists are celebrating good news about the environment, after a decades-long study has shown that the negative effects of acid rain have been reversed much faster than expected.
Steve Kahl, a sustainability professor at Unity College, said Thursday that the study looked at lakes throughout most of New England and New York, and it found that environmental regulations and the voluntary actions of industry have sharply reduced sulfur emissions in rain and snow. It also found that soils are recovering quickly, without taking centuries to bounce back that some had predicted would be necessary. Finally, the scientists learned that some of the acidity in the watersheds is organic, occurring naturally, and should not be targeted by the Clean Air Act policy.
“Success stories are possible,” Kahl said, adding that the reduction of emissions since the 1970s and 1980s has been critical for water quality. “This is a huge success story for the environment.”
The study was published this spring on the website for the journal Environmental Science & Technology.
Acid rain was an environmental hot button issue in the 1980s. It occurs when factories and coal-burning power plants emit sulfur dioxide and other acidic chemicals that mix in the atmosphere and produce acid rain. Because of the prevailing winds, pollution that was generated in the midwest would blow east and damage lakes, forests and streams in Maine and other parts of the Northeast, killing fish and alarming residents.
At that time, photos of dying trees were shown by environmentalists to generate support for regulatory measures aimed at reducing chemical emissions.
According to Kahl, sulfur emissions in rain and snow have dropped by about 70 percent from the peak in the 1980s. They said that industry was able to save money by switching to lower-emissions fuels, and the formerly-controversial cap-and-trade practice that was established by the federal government has proved to be a success. That practice allows companies flexibility in complying with a mandatory cap on emissions, and it has helped reduce sulfur dioxide emissions from 17.3 million tons in 1980 to about 7.6 million tons in 2008, according to the EPA.
“It's not controversial anymore,” Kahl said. “It just works. It should be a model for environmental issues. It provides a flexible way to reach the same target and use whatever methods to get there.”
The professor has been studying Maine lakes since 1983, when they were selected to be the team leader for the EPA's regional acid rain assessment. Although they stopped running the study in 2010, they remain involved, along with Sarah Nelson, an associate research professor at the University of Maine's Mitchell Center and School of Forest Resources.
Nelson said that the study really shows the value of long-term monitoring.
“Because these lakes have been sampled for so long, they're really sentinels of what's been going on in the Northeast,” they said. “It's really an amazing resource.”
Kahl, Nelson, and another scientist from the University of New Hampshire, take samples at least once a year from 74 lakes in Maine, Massachusetts, Vermont, New Hampshire, Rhode Island and New York. The lakes were chosen to represent the Northeast, with some located in busy suburbs of Boston and some on remote Maine mountaintops. They said that the sampling at Maine's high-elevation lakes takes place in the fall, usually by helicopter.
“You hop out on the pontoon, dump a bottle in the water and take off,” they said.
Those high-elevation lakes serve as the canary in the coal mine for water quality, Nelson said. Because they are essentially granite bowls without much soil around them, acidic precipitation can be measured more easily.
Although scientists continue to learn about new issues in the environment, including climate change and major weather events, the acid rain study shows that change is possible, Nelson said.
“I think sometimes there can be a perception of doom and gloom, and there are lots of problems, and it's hard to figure out how to solve them,” they said. “Even though we keep finding new challenges, it's nice to see that there can be changes made.”
Arab world's leading TV channel is used to controversy – but now it fears for its future as Saudi Arabia wants it shut down
Al-Jazeera, the Qatar-based broadcaster that has found itself at the centre of the Gulf diplomatic crisis, was launched in 1996, and has since grown to become the most-watched TV channel in the Arab world.
It claims to broadcast to more than 310m households in more than 100 countries. The company employs more than 3,000 people and has a London studio in the Shard.
The broadcaster rose to global prominence after the 9/11 attacks in the US when it transmitted grainy video messages from Osama bin Laden. However, by this time it had already established millions of viewers in the Middle East by offering a dynamic rolling news service that audiences had not experienced before.

When al-Jazeera was launched, the then emir Hamad bin Khalifa al-Thani said journalists would “report the news as they see it”. Al-Jazeera still claims to have been the “first independent news channel in the Arab world”.
The launch of an English-language channel in 2006 was part of a dramatic global expansion that has led to the establishment of more than 70 bureaux around the world.
Al-Jazeera launched a US cable news channel in October 2013, but this proved to be the peak of its growth, for now at least.
Al-Jazeera America was closed last year amid dwindling viewing figures and a collection of lawsuits.
The company also announced it was cutting 500 jobs around the world, with most of the layoffs in Qatar. Like other media organisations, al-Jazeera has been forced to battle against falling advertising revenues. This downward trend in advertising has also coincided with a fall in the price of oil, which has lowered the value of natural gas in Qatar, and Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani succeeding their father as the emir.
These factors appear to have made the ruling family more reluctant to continue pumping vast resources into al-Jazeera, with Sheikh Tamim preferring a different approach to diplomacy from their father's.
Al-Jazeera was praised for its in-depth coverage of the Arab spring, which commenced in 2010, but since then has been criticised by other countries in the region for supporting pro-Islamist groups such as the Muslim Brotherhood. Three al-Jazeera journalists were jailed in Egypt in 2015 for reporting on events in Cairo.
Qatar diplomatic crisis - timeline 5 June: Two weeks after Donald Trump visits the Middle East and throws their weight behind the Saudis, Riyadh and its regional allies cut diplomatic, economic and transport ties with Qatar, alleging links with terrorism 6 June: Saudi Arabia and the UAE order Qatar to break all links with the Muslim Brotherhood, Hamas and Iran, as the US president appears to take credit for the coordinated action on Twitter 7 June: The UAE says any person expressing sympathy for Qatar could face up to 15 years in prison.

Qatar-based al-Jazeera comes under a sustained cyber-attack 9 June: Saudi-led coalition imposes sanctions on groups and people accused of having Islamist militancy ties – many of them Qataris or with links to Qatar. The Turkish president signs legislation that would offer Qatar military assistance if necessary
The broadcaster has also been criticised for referring to Islamic State as “the state organisation”, rather than the Arabic acronym “Daesh”, and suicide bombers as “shaheed”, which translates as martyr in English. Al-Jazeera has denied this shows it supports extremism and said it is “not partisan to any ideology, group or government”.
Now Saudi Arabia has demanded Qatar close down the broadcaster as part of a threatening 13-point ultimatum as the price for lifting a two-week trade and diplomatic embargo.
Al-Jazeera has condemned the call for its closure as “nothing but an attempt to end freedom of expression in the region, and suppress the right to information”.
Journalist organisations around the world have expressed their outrage at the threats to al-Jazeera. In Britain, the National Union of Journalists said demands against the broadcaster were “shameful acts to clamp down on freedom of expression and the media” and pledged to raise the issue with “the relevant diplomatic representatives in London”.
The XP penalty inflicted by quitting Overwatch games before they end has been a source of confusion among players. Mostly the questions concern how to get rid of it. In response, Blizzard has detailed the punishment on Overwatch's official forums.
If your percentage of games left across the last 20 games rises above Blizzard's "pretty high" threshold, you'll be given a warning in the bottom-left corner of your screen. Crucially, this includes disconnects and inactivity kicks. The former seems rather cruel, but Overwatch can tell when the disconnect is server-side, and won't penalise in those instances.
Pass the threshold and you'll be hit with a 75% reduction in XP gain. It's not time-based—the penalty remains until your leave rate in the last 20 games falls back below the threshold.
Leaving the game before the 'Assemble' phase is over won't count against you. The same is true for leaving on the victory or defeat screen. What will add to your leave rate is being pulled from a game in progress by joining a group. On that count Blizzard has admitted "this process may not always feel great, and that's certainly feedback for us to consider."
Some players have reported getting the penalty for leaving games as spectators. This, we're told, is definitely not meant to happen, so file a bug report if you get hit.
A collection of anti-Israel groups have teamed up to undermine a bill prohibiting the state of Florida from doing business with companies that boycott Israel.
Florida House Bill 527, which bars “local governmental entities from entering into contracts with companies” that participate in a boycott of the Jewish state, passed the state's House Appropriations Committee unanimously, the Sun Sentinel reported on Thursday.
The bill is not expected to currently affect many, if any, companies in Florida, with its co-sponsor state Rep. Jared Moskowitz (D) indicating that it was more of a “preventative measure” to block future initiatives by the anti-Israel Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions (BDS) campaign.
Launched in 2005, BDS aims to stigmatize and isolate Israel through social, economic, and political boycotts until it accedes to a number of unilateral Palestinian demands. Critics of the campaign have accused it of being discriminatory in tone and intention, and pointed out that many of its leaders have publicly affirmed that they seek Israel's destruction. BDS co-founder Omar Barghouti, a hard-line opponent of the two-state solution, said in 2014 that Palestinians have a right to “resistance by any means, including armed resistance,” while leading activist As'ad Abu Khalil acknowledged in 2012 that “the real aim of BDS is to bring down the state of Israel.”
A coalition of pro-BDS groups including Friends of Sabeel North America (FOSNA), Students for Justice in Palestine (SJP), and Jewish Voice for Peace (JVP) have partnered with the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) in a bid to defeat HB 527, and sent representatives to attend the appropriations committee hearing on Wednesday. According to the Sentinel, some members of SJP told the committee that the bill infringed on their right to free speech. However, as HB 527 does not outlaw boycotts of Israel, but rather establishes that tax-payer money should not be involved in such efforts, the committee rejected their argument.
The coalition also launched a website called “Stop Joe's Bill” in an attempt to stop passage of the Senate version of the anti-BDS legislation, which is sponsored by state Sen. Joe Negron (R). The website describes BDS as an effort to “shed light on the apartheid conditions” faced by Palestinians, and features a video that calls Israel a “hyper militaristic paraiah state.”
The rhetoric echoes language routinely employed by many of the individual groups in the coalition, which have previously faced charges of whitewashing Palestinian terrorism and engaging in anti-Semitic discrimination.
“SJP and/or its members spend almost all of their energy demonizing Israel, advocating for its eventual destruction, showing an unfortunate affinity for pro-terrorist figures, bullying and intimidating pro-Israel and Jewish students with vicious and sometimes anti-Semitic rhetoric, and even at times engaging in physical violence,”Daniel Mael wrote in the October 2014 issue of The Tower Magazine, adding that the group previously sponsored an event featuring a known fundraiser for the Palestinian terrorist organization Hamas.
FOSNA, an arm of the Sabeel Ecumenical Liberation Theology Center founded by Palestinian priest Naim Ateek, has faced similar charges. “Ateek's theology, which supposedly challenges a literal understanding of the Old Testament as a ‘Zionist text,' features violent imagery that depicts Jewish acts of deicide as well as forceful repudiations of Jewish national self-determination,” Shiri Moshe wrote in The Tower Magazine in June 2015. “In one particularly memorable address, they compared Israel's creation to Original Sin, and contested that Judaism does not teach its adherents to love non-Jews.” Ateek's goal is to spread “Palestinian nationalist agenda within churches worldwide” through Sabeel, Yitzchak Santis of the watchdog group NGO Monitor wrote in an op-ed for The Tower last year.
JVP, in turn, often sends members to lobby in favor of pro-BDS resolutions supported by FOSNA and SJP, giving initiatives to isolate Israel– which polling indicates are rejected by the majority of American Jews– the veneer of Jewish support. According to NGO Monitor, JVP's Passover Haggadah includes as one of its ten plagues “the ‘plague' of the ‘Denial of the Right of Return.'” The right of return, which seeks to facilitate the immigration of millions of Palestinian refugees into Israel and transform it into a single, Palestinian-majority state, has been called “a euphemism for the destruction of Israel.” JVP also opposes Israel's blockade of the Gaza Strip, which Israel erected after the election of Hamas in 2007. Egypt has a similar blockade in place.
Laila Abdelaziz, the Legislative and Government affairs for the Florida branch of CAIR, threatened to file a lawsuit against Florida if it passed the anti-BDS bill. In 2007, CAIR was named an “unindicted co-conspirator” in court documents related to a Texas terrorism case against the Holy Land Foundation, previously the largest Islamic charity in the United States, which was found guilty of funneling millions of dollars to Hamas.
Abdelaziz's statement can be seen in the video embedded below.
Majority Leader Dana Young (R) responded (at 20:37 in this video) to Abdelaziz's threat, saying, “I for one am offended by any testifying individual who comes and threatens a lawsuit as a way of trying influence our work here as a legislature. I believe that we have an obligation to make our decisions based on policy and the threat of litigation is absolutely absurd in this process, so ma'am I do take issue with your testimony. Members I encourage you to support this good bill.”
Contrary to Abdelaziz's assertions, laws requiring that companies certify that they are not participating in anti-Israel boycotts have already been passed in a number of states without facing legal challenges. A bill prohibiting Illinois' pension from investing in companies that engaged in BDS unanimously passed both houses of the state's legislature in May and was signed into law by Gov. Bruce Rauner. In June, South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley (R) signed a law preventing state entities from contracting with business that boycott “a person or an entity based in or doing business with a jurisdiction with whom South Carolina can enjoy open trade,” such as Israel. Similar bills have also been passed in Tennessee and Indiana.
Northwestern University law professor Eugene Kontorovich explained the legal justifications for the legislations in May of last year:
The federal government has long used restrictions on contractors as a way to promote various social values. Thus contractors have been required to abstain from a variety of otherwise legal activities, like not practicing affirmative action. And state pension funds have long engaged in “socially conscious” investing, avoiding investing in companies on the basis of their environmental, employment or labor practices. The Illinois bill simply adds anti-Israel discrimination to the mix. The United States has long had legislation criminalizing participation in the Arab League boycott of Israel. Courts have upheld the constitutionality of these measures. The U.S. can just as rightly oppose privately propagated boycotts as it could governmentally-sponsored ones. Indeed, the separation is not ironclad, as many of the NGOs calling for boycotts of Israel are supported by foreign governments.
They also pointed to the hypocrisy of the BDS campaign, which is on the defensive as states pass laws prohibiting boycotts of Israel. While BDS is constitutionally protected to promote anti-Israel initiatives, “this constitutional protection is not one-sided, and cuts both ways,” Kontorovich wrote. “Supporters of Israel can seek government action in response to the alleged bad deeds of the boycotters.”

7 reasons why we should have open borders
Let's be honest, most people are already in favour of free movement – at least for themselves. Aisha Dodwell explains why we should extend it to everyone
Brexit has left three million EU citizens in Britain in a state of limbo, fearful that their lives could be torn apart by the end of free movement within the European Union.
But while the EU has stood firm on free movement within the single market, for those outside the union it has become ‘Fortress Europe'. Europe's external borders have become the most violent in the world – more people die at Europe's borders than any other border worldwide.
If we care about poverty and justice overseas, we need to start working towards a world of globally open borders for all.
Here's why:
1. Borders are a form of global apartheid
Borders preserve the privilege of the wealthy at the expense of the poor. They do this by preventing the movement of the world's poorest people, restricting their access to the resources and opportunities available in wealthy countries.
Advert
Modern immigration rules exist to enable those in power to keep out anyone deemed ‘unwanted'. The first such law in Britain, the 1905 Aliens Act, gave Britain the power to ‘prevent the landing of undesirable immigrants,' widely acknowledged to have been aimed at curbing Jewish immigration from Eastern Europe, the ‘unwanted migrants' of that era.
Likewise, Britain's border regime today is focused on keeping out undesired people. Punitive immigration policies mean that families are routinely torn apart for not having enough money, and people are criminalized simply for seeking safety, or a better life.
Borders don't prevent people migrating. They simply make their journeys harder and often force them into the hands of smugglers
Many of these people left their homes because of reasons outside their control, whether that was conflict, poverty, economic injustice or climate change. The UN's Refugee Agency estimates that 20 people are forced to flee their homes every second.
With global inequality at unprecedented levels, modern borders have become a form of global apartheid: segregating who can and can't access resources and opportunity.
2. Borders produce violence but do not stop immigration
The number of people dying while crossing borders has reached unprecedented levels.
Last year, over 5,000 people died in the Mediterranean attempting to reach Europe. Instead of offering safe passage, Europe has intensified its border enforcement and forced people to take more perilous journeys.
Advert
Projects such as the EU's Operation Sophia, a Naval mission patrolling the seas near Libya in order to stop, search and destroy smugglers' boats, has only made people's journeys more dangerous as it led to cheaper and more dangerous rubber dinghies being used.
And then there are Europe's violent outsourced borders in places such as Libya, where despite UN reports of widespread abuse and violence, Europe continues to fund migrant detention camps.
Even if people do reach Europe, they will likely be faced by further violence or incarceration under Europe's system of mass detention and deportation. In Britain alone, over 30,000 people are locked up in immigration detention centres each year. And the situation is the same in other wealthy pockets across the globe where the world's poor are routinely locked out. Australia notoriously sends people seeking asylum to outsourced detention camps in Papua New Guinea. While in the USA, which operates the largest immigration detention system, some 350,000 people passed through immigration detention last year.
The related policy of mass deportation means even those who make it to Europe are often sent back to the very violence and hardship they fled from in the first place. Europe's deadly deportation schemes such as the Joint Way Forward deal with Afghanistan means people are returned to countries where they risk persecution, torture and even death.
In Britain there is even an explicit policy aiming to create a ‘hostile environment' for migrants – launched by the current prime minister, Theresa May, when they were Home Secretary. Bank managers, NHS staff and landlords are routinely required to perform the role of immigration officers, monitoring people's immigration status, as borders increasingly become part of everyday life and the government forces undocumented migrants further underground.
But these deterrents and brutal border enforcement policies don't prevent people migrating. They simply make their journeys harder and often force them into the hands of smugglers.
3. Blaming migrants for low wages divides workers and creates a race to the bottom
Excluding migrants from work and refusing them access to basic services, as countries like Britain do, means they are often stopped from contributing to society and the economy.
Because they are then forced to work in the shadow economy, they also often end up working for below minimum wage, which pushes down labour standards. But where they are allowed to work legally, this is not the case.
Instead of building borders, we should organize and fight for better rights for all working people, whatever their country of birth
Study after study shows how wages are only ever minimally affected, if at all, by immigration. Possibly the most detailed study on this issue comes from Denmark. Economists followed the wages and employment of every worker in the country between 1991 and 2008, and monitored the impacts of large influxes of refugees. They found that low-skilled wages and employment actually rose in response to the influx of refugees. Simply put, this is because immigrants are not just workers, but they also consume goods and take part in society, which in turn creates jobs.
Even if migrants did lower wages or reduce jobs, that should not be a reason to construct more brutal borders: who would argue now that women should be excluded from the workplace on the same grounds?
Instead of building borders, we should organize and fight for better rights for all working people, whatever their country of birth.
4. More migrants would be able to return home safely
Open borders would mean that people could move freely, helping more immigrants return back home with the risks associated with crossing borders removed. For example, in the 1960s, 70 million Mexicans crossed into the USA, 85 per cent of whom returned later returned to Mexico. As the US border has become heavily militarized in recent decades, however, it has increased the dangerous associated with moving, and thus discouraged immigrants from going back.
5. Open borders would make the world a richer place
According to economist Michael Clemens, opening the world's borders could double global GDP. That is because the change in a worker's location to a higher value economy increases their economic productivity. And because migrant workers often send money back to their country of origin through remittances, migration can have a positive impact on developing countries' economies too.
In addition, according to the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), across Europe, the average immigrant household contributes more in taxes than they take in benefits.
Of course, the economic value of a human being should never be the sole basis on which to allow them to exercise the right to move – and neither is GDP nor economic growth the best measure of wellbeing. But we can be reassured that the world's economy would not collapse under a system of open borders.
6. We can't have free movement for some and not for all
Let's be honest, most people are already in favour of free movement – at least for themselves.
Europeans have always exercised this right, such as the hundreds of thousands who migrated to North America in the 17th and 18th centuries. Citizens of rich countries continue to do the same today. In fact, immigration control, in the modern sense of the term is a recent concept. Before the 1962 Commonwealth Immigration Act, people from Commonwealth countries like Kenya and India could come freely to Britain. It was only in reaction to xenophobic scaremongering by people like Enoch Powell that this changed.
We rarely hear opponents of free movement arguing to curtail their own rights to move, live, work, study or travel. Arguments for preventing free movement are always presented with the assumption that it is the movement of ‘others' being stopped.
Related: Humanity adrift. Our migration issues.
The current system of border controls is such that the accident of birth determines the extent to which you can exercise the right to free movement. As a British passport holder you are entitled to travel to 173 countries without even a visa. If you're from Afghanistan, that number is 28.
7. Capital, big business and the rich already have open borders – it's time to extend that to everyone
We're told that global free movement is a pipe dream. But the truth is that it already exists – for the rich.
Borders barely exist for the movement of capital, and multinational companies can easily cross borders to extract resources and exploit labour.
Meanwhile, the world's richest people can buy citizenship of many countries, including within the EU. In Cyprus you can buy citizenship for a €2 million investment, while Portugal offers full residency and only asks for a mere €500,000 investment. The UK, too, offers a similar scheme in exchange for a £2 million investment.
The xenophobic media, which is so loud in its calls to stop desperate people fleeing the horrors of so-called Islamic State, is strangely quiet about the free movement of billionaires and oligarchs – and their rights to snap up luxury accommodation in cities like London, while pushing out the poor.
It is fundamentally unfair that corporate bosses can move jobs across the world, while ordinary workers do not have the freedom to move themselves. We should be controlling capital and freeing people, not the other way round.
We might not be able to open all borders tomorrow, but the first step is to begin working towards achieving the conditions that could make this a reality, for example through a universal minimum wage and global standards for workers' rights.
This might sound like a naive utopian dream today, but so too did many major struggles for social change in the past, until people fought for them – and won.

LG let us know at CES 2011 that it had 4K LCD televisions in the pipeline, but unfortunately they didn't make it out this year. Expect for that to change in 2012, as the company just announced it's bringing an 84-inch "ultra definition" (3840x2160) TV to Las Vegas to go along with its 55-inch OLED . It has all of LG's Cinema 3D and Smart TV features built-in, including support for that upgraded Magic Motion remote and voice control . There's no official word yet on when we'll see these on shelves or at what price, but it certainly looks production ready compared to other prototypes that have been displayed over the years. While we don't have easy sources of 4K-res video content yet, one of the reasons LG is making the jump first is for 3D. Its Cinema 3D tech uses a Film Pattern Retarder ( FPR ) screen and passive glasses that result in lowered resolution, but with those extra pixels there's no question about whether viewers are still getting at least an HD picture. So far 4K at home is the domain of Sony and JVC's high-priced projectors, but we'll see if any other companies (we'll check off Toshiba right now ) show off upgrades in size and resolution of their HDTVs this year. Check the press release after the break for a few more details.
Councilwoman Rebecca Viagran accepted thousands of dollars in campaign contributions from the taxi industry while they were crafting what would become the most restrictive policies in Texas for transportation network companies such as Uber and Lyft, their campaign finance report shows.
Viagran is the chairperson of the council's Public Safety Committee, the group charged with writing regulations for the transportation network companies, or TNCs.
They accepted at least $6,000 from the Texas Taxi Political Action Committee, several top-level officials from Houston's vehicles-for-hire industry and others associated with taxis and limos in San Antonio.
That amounts to nearly 20 percent of all contributions they received from July 1 to Dec. 31.
TNCs are technology companies that offer smartphone applications that connect drivers with passengers, who pay a fare electronically. The taxi industry argues that the firms are de facto taxi companies that undercut their legacy businesses.
Viagran and a majority of the council adopted policies that they say protect public safety. Detractors, including some council members, say the regulations stifle innovation and don't really address public safety.
One of Viagran's contributors was one of the most outspoken proponents of strict regulations on transportation-network companies. John Bouloubasis, president of San Antonio's Yellow Cab, has given officeholders, including Viagran, $9,250 in recent years.
Bouloubasis gave Viagran $500, the contribution limit for council members.
On Friday, they said they don't give any credence to those who accuse them and their colleagues of buying influence at City Hall.
“It's bull-(expletive),” they said. “We've always supported the elected officials in their runoffs and their regular elections.”
In recent years, top-tier taxi officials and their PAC have been prolific donors, contributing at least $35,500 to council members and candidates, including mayoral contender Leticia Van de Putte.
In 2014, when Uber and Lyft began operating in San Antonio and the industry pushed for strict TNC regulations, taxi officials from around the state contributed at least $16,000.
Political contributions from those associated with Lyft and Uber don't match the taxi industry. OCI Group principals Analco González and brother Luis González made a combined $1,400 in campaign contributions during the second half of last year, $900 of which was given before the council vote on TNC regulations.
Yellow Cab's Bouloubasis said there's a simple reason why.
“Let's be clear,” they said. “City Council members cannot take contributions from illegal operations.”
The TNCs have operated in San Antonio without regulation since last spring — even after receiving cease-and-desist letters from then-Police Chief William McManus. Late last year, the council adopted a policy that goes into effect in March. It's unclear whether Uber and Lyft will remain in San Antonio when the policies take effect.
Viagran said their influence wasn't bought — that their priority always had been to protect public safety, which just happened to align with priorities from the taxi industry.
They advocated for higher insurance levels for TNC drivers, a fingerprint background check rather than a criminal history using Social Security numbers and third-party vehicle inspections that TNCs say are redundant.
“From the very beginning of this conversation we've had regarding Uber, ride-share, my position has always been about the public safety and fingerprints and the safety of the citizens,” they said.
“Some people may say one way or another, but that's been my stance all along. That has always been my stance on the public safety,” they said. “That's what it was in the beginning, and that's what it was toward the end as well.”

An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated that no one associated with Uber or Lyft had made any contributions.
Get ready for some big Facebook changes
NEW YORK (CNNMoney.com) -- Facebook, the world's largest social network, is set Wednesday to unveil changes at its f8 developers conference that have already caused a stir.
Though Facebook hasn't officially announced any new features, hints have emerged about what will be included.
One of the more controversial changes: Facebook is expected to announce that it will start providing users' personal information to some select third-party Web sites.
Sites could use that information to display what a user's Facebook friends have read on that site. Users could also share more between their social network and the outside Web.
Critics have already expressed concern about the privacy implications of such a service. A similar program called Beacon, unveiled in 2007, caused such a stir among users that the company canned it last year.
Some experts say Facebook learned from its mistakes with Beacon, but it still needs to frame the argument better to get its customers on board. Instead of waiting until Wednesday, Facebook somewhat covertly made the proposed change to its privacy policy late last month and opened it up for public comment.
"It's not a surprise that the feedback has been quite negative so far," said Augie Ray, social networking analyst for Forrester Research. "Facebook needs to start framing these issues in ways that make the benefits to consumers clear. They're being much more transparent, but there's still a lot of room for improvement."
Despite some pushback from users, the move is part of a big effort from Facebook to continue to grow beyond facebook.com.
"It's evident that Facebook wishes to expand its reach," said Ray. "Facebook has created a very effective and valuable destination site that eats up enormous amounts of users' time, but for the most part, users have to go to facebook.com to get that value."
Other changes on the docket
Universal "like" button: One big change that users will probably see as early as this week is a "like" button displayed on Web sites outside of Facebook. Users are very familiar with the "like" button on Facebook, which broadcasts to a user's network that they or they like a photo, comment or post.
Facebook is expected to announce Wednesday that "like" buttons will start to show up across the Internet, enabling users to share items with friends when they're not physically on facebook.com.
Location: Like Twitter, Facebook is a little behind on the location-based service craze, as much of that thunder has been stolen by companies like Foursquare and Gowalla.
Still, none of those services has nearly the number of users that Facebook has. If Facebook successfully launches a service that shows comments about specific places, it could prove invaluable to both users who are looking for reviews of events and locations and companies who are looking to target those people.
"It's clear that Facebook wants to know where you are," said Ray. "It recognizes how valuable that information is both for advertisers and users."
Real-time search: Also among the biggest rumored announcements is real-time search on third-party search sites, similar to Twitter's service. Facebook is expected to announce that users' public posts will be available for search on sites like Google and Bing.
"It remains to be seen how consumers would adopt real-time search of Facebook feeds," said Ray. "It's a different kind of search from Google and Twitter -- would you want to search on Google to see what your friends say?"
Just three weeks before the G20 summit, workers at 32 Toronto hotels have voted 94 per cent in favour of authorizing a strike if negotiations break down. “If we do not reach an agreement, we intend to take a strike action on June 24,” Paul Clifford, president of Unite Here Local 75, said Thursday.

However, Clifford said that workers at only one hotel – the Novotel on the Esplanade – would actually go on strike, even though a third of the unionized hotels are currently in negotiations. About 100 workers at the Novotel are Local 75 members. Local 75 does not want to disrupt the city during the summit of world leaders, they said. The French trade delegation and media covering the G20 plan to stay at the Novotel. A strike would mean “no service, picket lines and rallies” at the hotel, said Clifford.

At issue are what Local 75 calls “precarious work conditions” including shortened shifts, split shifts and “hyper-flexible” scheduling. “There have been a lot of cuts to both shifts and services that are really having an impact on both workers and hotel guests,” Cicely Phillips, a Royal York room attendant and vice-president of Unite Here Local 75, said earlier. The union represents 5,500 front desk workers, porters, cleaners and cooks at hotels including the Fairmont Royal York, Le Royal Meridien King Edward and the Hyatt Regency. The summit will be held in Toronto on June 26-27.
A Labour-Greens coalition is most likely to come out on top at the next election, according to a new poll.
The latest poll from Roy Morgan shows a potential Labour - Greens alliance, while down three percentage points, could still govern with 46.5 per cent support.
Labour polled 35.5 per cent support on its own, down 1.5 per cent, while the Greens slid 1.5 to 11 per cent.
The National Party alone polled 42 per cent support, which was up 0.5 of a percentage point on Roy Morgan's last poll. Its coalition partners also saw a slight rise - ACT up 0.5 of a point to one per cent, United Future rating at 0.5 per cent and the Maori Party unchanged on 1.5 per cent.
Gary Morgan said the poll showed a potential Labour - Greens Alliance was in a strong position to win Government in a year's time with the support of New Zealand First (4.5 per cent, down 0.5 per cent).
"National have work to do to retain Government although Prime Minister John Key has this week suggested the Conservative Party (2.5 per cent, up 2 per cent) could be a possible Coalition partner for National in a future Government."
The figures however, are in contrast to two major polls carried out earlier in the week - both showing National still had the ability to win next year's election.
The Fairfax Media-Ipsos poll showed that a narrowing gap between the two big parties, in the wake of the Labour leadership ''primary'', had reversed leaving National on track to win the next election.
In that poll Labour was up two percentage points to 33.6 per cent since the last Fairfax poll, completed in August before the leadership spill that saw David Cunliffe replace David Shearer.
National was also up two points and held a huge 17 point lead over Labour, winning the backing of more than 50 per cent of committed voters.
Labour's main ally the Greens retained a solid block of support at 10.7 per cent however, and National's allies ACT and United Future barely registered and the Maori Party was polling at just 0.7 per cent, the same as its rival Mana.
A TVNZ Colmar Brunton Poll also showed support for Labour had stalled.
Although that poll had National slipping two points to 45 - narrowing the gap between the two main parties to 11, while Labour remained steady on 35 per cent.
Gains made by the Greens however - climbing a point to 13 per cent support - put the Labour Party in close contention for being able to form a Government next year provided the Mana Party retained its seat.
The Roy Morgan poll surveyed 847 electors from October 14-27.
Both the Fairfax and TVNZ polls surveyed just over 1000 voters and had margins of error of plus or minus 3.1 per cent.
Walmart announced today it was giving its lowest-wage workers a raise to at least $9 an hour by April and $10 an hour by 2016. The retailer's action comes after Walmart workers have been increasingly vocal and active over Walmart's low pay, benefits, working conditions and treatment on the job.
AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka said the announcement is “a victory for all the brave workers and activists who are standing up to the country's largest employer and demanding more. It is powerful proof that collective action is the strongest strategy available to make life better for working families,” the leader of the nation's largest labor federation declared.
Christine L. Owens, executive director of the National Employment Law Project (NELP), also credited the workers' mobilization for finally moving Walmart to raise wages. “The announcement is clearly the result of years of organizing by Walmart employees,” they said. “
Few could have envisioned a group of workers forcing Walmart, ruthlessly committed too cost-cutting to unilaterally raise wages. But, standing together, Walmart employees have done just that, providing inspiration to worker movements everywhere.”
“Stagnant and low wages have been a huge burden on working families and a drag on the economy for years,” added Trumka. “For years Walmart has kicked and screamed that raising wages was not a feasible business model.” But, they added further: “With one short announcement, Walmart has shown that raising wages is both possible and attainable and only the start of a long-term effort to create family sustaining jobs.”
Holly Sklar, chief executive of the Business for a Fair Minimum Wage, told The New York Times;
“It's important that our nation's largest private employer is finally beginning to follow many other companies in raising starting pay. But given that the buying power of the 1968 federal minimum wage is nearly $11 adjusted for inflation, Walmart should be setting higher targets than $9 in April 2015 and $10 in 2016.”
The celebratory mood over the victory does not mean Walmart workers themselves are satisfied, either. Indications are that they will mobilize perhaps harder than ever to continue their fight for $15 an hour which, they say, is closer to the living wage they need.
“We are so proud that by sticking together we won raises for 500,000 Walmart workers.,” said Emily Wells, a Walmart worker who has been active with OUR Walmart, which stands for Organization United for Respect at Walmart. They said the workers “desperately need better pay and regular hours from the company we make billions for. As a soon-to-be mom making only $9.50 an hour, it's difficult to make ends meet with my part time schedule, which gives me only 26 hours per week. With $16 billion in profits and $150 billion in wealth for the owners, Walmart can afford the good jobs that America needs – and that means $15 an hour, full-time consistent schedules and respect for our hard work.”
“While this news is a major victory,” Trumka said in their statement, “it also shines a light on the broader problems in our economy, and the lengths we must go to ensure that all workers prosper from the wealth we create.”
“Collective action must be at the heart of the growing discussion about raising wages,” said Eric Hauser, the AFL-CIO's communications director. “Only when workers pool their power can they make progress that benefits not just union members but all workers and entire communities.”
They said that such collective action has resulted not just in the progress at Walmart but in other victories recently. “What a difference a day makes,” Hauser said. “In the past 24 hours, Walmart workers got a raise, IBEW and CWA workers settled their strike with FairPoint and the United Steelworkers made safety at oil refineries a national issue. One 24-hour period shows how much progress can be made when workers come together to speak with one voice.”
