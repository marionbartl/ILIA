This story has been updated.
The U.S. Supreme Court late Monday rejected an appeal from a county clerk in Kentucky who said she could not issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples because of her religious objections.
Kim Davis, the clerk in Rowan County, Kentucky, “holds an undisputed sincerely held religious belief that marriage is a union between a man and a woman, only,” her lawyers said in asking the court to block a lower court order directing her to issue the licenses.
But the Supreme Court denied her request without explanation in a brief one-line order. No dissents were noted, and the court acted without seeking a response from the state.
RELATED: Gay couples still can't marry in Rowan County, Kentucky
It was the first legal skirmish to reach the Supreme Court since it declared on June 26th that the Constitution guarantees gay couples the right to get married.
Immediately after that ruling, Kentucky's governor, Steve Beshear, ordered all the state's county clerks to comply with the decision and issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples.
Saying she did not want to discriminate, Davis stopped issuing all marriage licenses — to both same-sex and opposite sex couples — in the days after the landmark decision. Two gay couples and two straight couples sued her, arguing that her duties as an elected official required her to act, despite her personal religious beliefs.
A federal judge ordered her to issue the licenses, and last week the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals agreed.
“It cannot be defensibly argued that the holder of the Rowan County Clerk's office, apart from who personally occupies that office, may decline to act in conformity with the United States Constitution as interpreted by a dispositive holding of the United States Supreme Court,” the appeals court said.
Davis' emergency request was directed to Justice Elena Kagan, who referred it to the full court for action.
“She's going to have to think and pray about her decision overnight. She certainly understands the consequences either way,” Mat Staver, founder of the law firm representing Davis, told the Associated Press Monday, hours before a court-ordered delay in the case expired. “She'll report to work tomorrow, and face whatever she has to face.”

Mohammad Hafeez is opening for Pakistan. Playing the first attacking shot of the innings, after five and a half overs of good cricket. It's a poor imitation of Brian Lara's back-of-a-length swivel pull that sails high and handsome, straight to the only man within 50 metres of it. Hafeez stares down at fine leg as if it is the first time he has ever seen that position before. His pure disbelief in hitting a ball in the air to an area that is covered on almost every cricket ground in the world is incredible.
He is out, and embarrassed. But Pakistan have ten more men. They will stand up.
The sun is out at Edgbaston. Cricket wisdom says this is a good thing. The pitch looks like a second-day pitch; it has barely a scar of battle. And it plays much the same way; flat, safe, lifeless. It hasn't seamed or swung much all day.
England look frustrated. Four overthrows are followed by three of their bowlers looking sullen at once. Steven Finn is still wicketless. Moeen Ali knows much is expected of him in a series he has mostly been hidden. And England knows that The Oval may help Pakistan a fair bit.
Then there is Sami Aslam, a man who was running drinks for Shan Masood a week ago, who is now batting like a ten-year Test match opener. Azhar Ali is in even better form than his first innings a hundred. Behind them are two of the all-time greatest batsmen in Pakistani cricket. And two quality players at No.6 and 7. Not that they are needed with Aslam and Azhar in complete control. This is Pakistan's time.
Every wicket should be England prying it from their vice-like grip. They cannot afford one more Hafeez-type wicket.
At lunch something changes. England goes from patient, to persistent. Stuart Broad bowls probing stuff, Moeen finds tricky drift. This is England's time.
Pakistan want to be No. 1, the undefeated at home, the warriors who travel, this is the match you need to save. Perhaps their chance of winning is gone, but the real teams, they fight like dogs to make sure they are not beaten. A day like this will have one moment when it will look impossible. It will be hard, but it is supposed to be hard to be the best, you are supposed to struggle.
Azhar is the first to feel the pressure. He leaves a ball from Broad that he should have left, but England moan and he worries. A few balls later he plays the same kind of ball and misses. Then he does get an edge and it doesn't reach Alastair Cook at slip. Now Moeen is beating him as well. It was his innings that looked steady as a rock; now it looks like a bunch of pebbles being thrown up in the air. He nervously pushes at a well-flighted ball from Moeen, his hand comes off the bat, and the wheels come off Pakistan's batting line-up.
"This team won't be together forever; you only get so many chances. Their chance to fight lasted 23 balls"
It is only one wicket, only two in over a third of the day, but it doesn't feel like only that, it feels like Pakistan has Hafeezed two wickets and the rest are entering a fire. England expect more. Aslam has gone from a stoic crease warrior to an endless worrier, hitting the ball into his pads, playing and missing and barely getting away with jabbing down on a yorker. At the other end the Younis Khan impersonator continued to hop around until he lunged at a ball he didn't need to be anywhere near, and he was the third Hafeez.
At this time the tiny amount of reverse swing that Broad had found had started to go even further for James Anderson. It is Test cricket, on the final day, and it is tough, even with the many things in their favour, nothing is easy. But that is what was always going to happen. There was always going to be a period when the English team got it, they worked out the pitch, found spin, or made the ball talk, and when Pakistan had to stand tall. This should have been their time, and instead, they cowered and hoped it would go away.
Misbah-ul-Haq, the one man who usually stands up, is pushing at everything. It is Finn's best spell of the series; Misbah is taken. This is not how Hafeez would have been dismissed, as he simply wouldn't have been that close to the ball in the first place. But without Misbah, who cares?
Asad Shafiq is a flurry of movement at the crease, all the poise he has shown in the series is completely non-existent. His batting, his referring, his general aura, is all confused. Sarfraz Ahmed brings his natural energy to the crease, chases a wide one and leaves. And then Aslam, the young man who had set up the platform, who had tamed the moving ball, who had survived the panic, leaves a dead straight ball.
Not all their batsmen played a Hafeez shot, but the entire batting line up went the full Hafeez. When they needed to be at their absolute best, when they needed to prove they could be No. 1, when they needed to believe, they lost 4 for 1. They were at their absolute worst, they proved they couldn't be No. 1, and they showed they already knew it.
These men, the Hafeez clan, then sit on the balcony and watch their tailenders, the worst of them, handle the bowling, the pitch, the pressure, for longer, and better. They saw 67 balls from Rahat Ali, and his back-foot drives, and Sohail Khan, with his legs side slogs, as it all got easier, and they weren't there to use it. This team won't be together forever; you only get so many chances. Their chance to fight lasted 23 balls.
They are out, and embarrassed. But Pakistan have one more Test. They must stand up.
Kūlgrinda (plural kūlgrindų; from the Samogitian kūlis 'stone' and grinda 'pavement', itself from grįsti, 'to rake, pull together')[1] is a hidden underwater stony road or ford across swamps and swampy areas used for defense in the history of Lithuania.[1] Similar secret roads made primarily of wood and ground were known as medgrinda (from medis, 'tree') and žemgrinda (from žemė, 'earth, ground') respectively.[2]
Undetectable from the surface, these roads were usually known only to the locals, and as such were an important element of the defense against various invaders, including the Teutonic Knights in the 13–14th centuries. Kūlgrindas provided a safe shortcut between villages, hillforts, and other defensive structures.[3] They were built by bringing stones, wood, or gravel over frozen swamps in the winter and letting them sink once the ice melted.[4] Such procedure would be repeated several times. Sometimes wooden posts were inserted to protect the elevated area from washing away.[5]
The remnants of kūlgrindas are most often found in the territory of Lithuania, but also in Kaliningrad Oblast (former East Prussia), Belarus, and Latvia.[2] It is estimated that Lithuania has 27 kūlgrindas and 7 medgrindas, about half of them in Samogitia.[6] The longest and best-known surviving kūlgrinda is across the Sietuva swamp between lakes Lūkštas and Paršežeris in Samogitia.[1] It survives in three segments and was used up to the 19th century as a road between Kaltinėnai and Tverai.[4] One of the first to investigate the Sietuva kūlgrinda was Ludwik Krzywicki.[4] Other kūlgrindas are found in the Amalva swamp in southern Lithuania and at Šiuraičiai near Priekulė.[1] The Alkupis kūlgrinda near Kvėdarna was severely damaged during land amelioration by Soviet authorities.[5] The oldest medgrinda was found in Kernavė and is dated to the 4–7th centuries.[7]
Rep. Carlos Curbelo (R-Fla.) said it would be “plain unprofessional” if FBI Director James Comey learned of his firing from television, as reported Tuesday night.
No one should find out via the television that they've been fired. If true, that's poor form and plain unprofessional. #Comey — Carlos Curbelo (@carloslcurbelo) May 10, 2017
Curbelo added in a separate statement that Comey's ouster must not impede the FBI's probe “of the Russian government's efforts to influence our last election.”

“Congress and the American people need a transparent explanation as to how this decision was reached and why it was executed at this time."

The White House said that a search for a new permanent FBI director would “begin immediately.”
Comey reportedly learned of his ouster from a television news report during a visit to an FBI field office in Los Angeles.
Staffers purportedly pulled Comey aside after he laughed at the report on a TV screen behind him, believing it was a prank.
Keith Schiller, the director of Oval Office operations at the White House, tried hand-delivering a letter from Trump to Comey informing him of the move late Tuesday.
But Comey, who was speaking to FBI employees in Los Angeles, was not present to receive the message.

An objective look at the world today will clearly reveal that a disproportionate number of people in positions of power in Western countries have Jewish names. For those who are the brunt of the nefarious activities of Western foreign policy, particularly the Middle East, “the Jews” then become the logical scapegoat. Fueling their suspicion is the enduring popularity of the notorious Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion, which outline an intricate and centuries-old Judeo-Masonic conspiracy to bring about a New World Order, to be governed by the “King of the Jews.”
To the unbiased observer, not intimidated by the cowardly tactics of the media, who dismiss any research into conspiracies as “paranoid,” the Protocols present a remarkable similarity to events as they appear to be unfolding. However, there is a deeper plot afoot than conspiracy researchers believe they discover by reading the Protocols, and that is the devious ruse of deliberately cultivating anti-Semitism in support of the Zionist cause.
The Protocols seem to be a product of such an audacious scheme.

Posted in Israel, Religion, World News
I keep getting sent various copies of the same story concerning the Italian government's announcement that it is giving away historic castles for free.
Puh-leeze.
As someone who has great experience with the machinations of the Italian government I have only one thing to say:
Are you interested in buying the Sydney harbor bridge?
Let's take a look at this too good to be true proposal.
If you've ever dreamed of owning, say, a 13th-century castle or Venetian island, then now is your chance. In an attempt to lure tourists away from overcrowded—and often overwhelmed—city centers across the country, Italy is giving away 103 historic sites for free.
Can you spot the fake news hidden in the quote? No? Okay, obviously you're not that experienced with blatant fraud. Let's add another piece to the puzzle.
Successful applicants will then be granted a nine or 50-year lease for the property on the basis that they then invest money, restructure, renovate and run it efficiently.
The fake news is the part where they say that you become a property owner. What you become is a property caretaker, working for free, and even worse, having to commit large amounts of your money to improve and then upkeep properties that successive Italian governments have seen no value in doing themselves.
And that's because there is no value there, at all. These places are literally in the middle of nowhere. An island in the Venetian lagoon? Are you kidding me? There are hundreds of islands in the Venetian lagoon which are entirely deserted due to the fact that you have to arrive by boat. Do you think that the government is going to divert its ferry service just because you were stupid enough to take on a 9 year lease?
I know, I know. You're pitching for the 50 year lease. Come over here and sit down; let me make it easy for you.
Nobody is going to get a 50 year lease. Perhaps the ruined farmhouse sitting by the railway tracks, but that will just be for show to lure in the other suckers. You'll get a 9 year lease, and at the end of it when you have spent all of your money then the government will unceremoniously turf you out without even a pat on the bottom for all your hard work and money that you invested.
And don't forget that in order to renovate your castle you will still have to do it under the onerous heritage laws, not to mention the tax regime where running a B&B will make you liable for a series of different tax structures, (not all of which are called taxes in order to try and hide them), that cumulatively add up to just under 70% tax on every cent that you will earn. Have fun with that, I know that I did.
The heritage laws are the real kicker here. The people who stand to benefit from this the most are the local licensed craftsmen whose services you will have to employ in order to bring your farmhouse back to an historical standard. Just so you can have a vague understanding of what you're in for, the local council fees and regulations for putting in a new window in Northern Italy run to just over €3000. To put that in some sort of perspective, the average monthly take home wage in those parts is around €800 a month.
And the cost of those charming and garrulous local craftsmen? Hoo boy, are you gonna get stung. I really can't be bothered doing it but I bet that if you mark all of the properties being offered on a map and then compare those points with the local employment rates for craftsmen, you just might discover that all of those spots are in a spot of bother, and this is the government's brilliant way of alleviating the problem for the next 9 years.
By the way, when I said brilliant, I really meant brilliant. There's nothing like getting clueless foreigners to spend all of their savings propping up your overpriced and under worked local tradesmen so they can live in the style to which they are accustomed.
Perhaps we can learn from that. But what am I thinking? We don't possess that kind of smarts. Our version of the local craftsmen benefiting from the influx of foreigners and their money are university administrators.
At least Italians have some style.
BC NDP leader John Horgan addressed the media in Victoria on Wednesday following the final results of the 2017 BC Election.
After absentee ballots were counted, the Liberals hold 43 seats in the Legislature while the NDP has 41 and the Green Party has 3.
The Liberals still won the popular vote with 40.36% of ballots cast but by only eight one-hundredths of a percent over the NDP.
Horgan says he's been working tirelessly on issues like healthcare and education and remains in constant communication the BC Greens.
“I have been talking to the leader of the Green Party (Andrew Weaver) and his team and I'm optimistic that we will be able to put together a framework that has the majority of support in the legislature.”
Horgan believes his party along with the BC Greens remains on the same page in relation to two major topics.
“We've been talking about the issues that we share. Certainly, proportional representation, getting big money out of politics, those are two fundamental issues for both parties and their fundamental because they address and effect people. I believe and Andrew Weaver believes that our government has been distorted by big money.”
“I believe proportional representation is a way forward for British Columbia that will allow voters to make sure that when they do vote for someone, that individual and that vote counts for something in our legislative assembly.”
Despite the BC Liberals getting by with a minority, Horgan believes is of the opinion this year's vote was a virtual dead heat.
“As I look at the popular vote it's a coin toss at 40.3 to 40.2 and the big issue is that 60% of those people who cast ballots voted for a new government. So I believe that's what they deserve and that's what they should get.”
On Tuesday, when Bitcoin Cash hit Coinbase, the popular user-friendly U.S.-based exchange, cryptocurrency's reputation as the financial wild west was on full display.
While anyone following along was well aware that Coinbase planned to add Bitcoin Cash, the currency created in August's Bitcoin hard fork, things still got weird immediately. After some suspicious pre-launch climbing, Bitcoin Cash's Coinbase launch immediately saw prices soar to almost three times those listed on other exchanges.
That “significant volatility” led Coinbase to freeze transactions for its newest asset, creating plenty of confusion in the process. Just a few hours later, the company disclosed that the chaos had prompted an insider trading investigation, a surprising concession after some in the cryptocurrency world cried foul (to be fair, they are often crying foul).
While it's not yet wholly clear what was going on, many digital currency enthusiasts have pointed to a Reddit thread from three days ago titled “ATTN: Bitcoin Cash added to Coinbase API (EXTREMELY BULLISH)” that claims to have spotted evidence of Bitcoin Cash's addition on a Coinbase API key permissions screen.
Given its broad disinterest in regulatory norms and preponderance of first-time investors, doctored screenshots trying to nudge prices one way or another are fairly common within the cryptocurrency community. Still, many Reddit users appeared to lend this particular thread enough credence to check it out for themselves. (Unfortunately, as Bitcoin Cash is now live, we weren't able to verify the listing's early appearance in the API.)
reporting myself to SEC for looking at the coinbase API 3 days before bitcoin cash launch its not about winning, its about doing the right thing pic.twitter.com/Tg9v3ZS5Wa — water daddy [lil spoofy] 💦 (@Lil_Spoofy) December 20, 2017
Again, Coinbase users knew that Bitcoin Cash was coming by January 1, 2018 — the deadline Coinbase gave itself in August — but most users assumed that the new coin would be withdrawal-only, letting Coinbase users who stored Bitcoin on the exchange at the time of the fork get their trapped Bitcoin Cash out of the platform. As Coinbase stated in its August 3 blog post:
We are planning to have support for bitcoin cash by January 1, 2018, assuming no additional risks emerge during that time. Once supported, customers will be able to withdraw bitcoin cash. We'll make a determination at a later date about adding trading support. In the meantime, customer bitcoin cash will remain safely stored on Coinbase.
Reddit's /r/btc community took the API breadcrumb as a signal that both narrowed Bitcoin Cash's looming Coinbase timeline and provided evidence that Coinbase intended to add trade options for the currency — a significant sign of adoption that would surely influence the altcoin's price across exchanges. “If you're a programmer you know this is a very strong sign that Bitcoin Cash will receive full integration and not just withdrawals,” one Redditor stated in the thread's replies.
Given its mainstream appeal and extreme ease of use relative to other exchanges, Coinbase is something of a cryptocurrency kingmaker. For any digital currency gaining Coinbase trading support, volume and prices would widely be expected to soar as the news spread. Obviously, anyone paying attention to potential Coinbase API hints or other subtle backend signals is likely doing so with the intent to cash in on such a surge.
“We can't verify the screenshot. But we publicly announced we would be supporting Bitcoin Cash in August, so it would be expected that Bitcoin Cash would appear on the API at some point,” a Coinbase spokesperson told TechCrunch in response to questions about the incident.
Whatever really went down, the situation demonstrates how Coinbase's decision to add any cryptocurrency makes for a very delicate rollout indeed. The company plans to introduce more altcoins on its platform in the coming year, so it will have ample opportunity to learn from its rocky, semi-surprise introduction of Bitcoin Cash on December 19.
Like many things in the digital currency world, cryptocurrency market forces are often even stranger and more inscrutable than their traditional financial counterparts. There might not be one single explanation for Bitcoin Cash's controversial pop on Tuesday, but the situation serves as yet another cautionary tale of the unique chaos of cryptocurrency, a financial realm where the rules are being written as they're broken.

You don't have to know me for long before you figure out that I love Pokémon. The games captivate every facet of my imagination. There are so many wonderful places from the series I could pick, but what fun would that be? Instead I will introduce you to a place that I have hated ever since I crawled out of the exit. Rock Tunnel, I choose you!
Rock Tunnel
Pokémon Red, Blue, and Yellow Version are established classics that bring back found memories, but one place is filled with darkness – literally. Rock Tunnel was one of the first major challenges in the game. The giant cave stood between you and Lavender Town as an obstacle you must overcome. With 19 trainers, non-stop random encounters, and a two-floor maze, there was a reason a Pokémon Center was right next to the entrance.
Like most classic games, Yellow Version didn't hold your hand, leaving you to your to their own devices. If you forgot to talk to the right NPC, you could miss out on critical knowledge. Rock Tunnel is pitch black and requires you to use Flash to illuminate the cave. If forgotten, it would leave you walking around in the dark and inevitably getting lost — to the point where you might have to reload your last save because you couldn't locate the ladder to escape. If you were smart, you remembered, but there was another problem. Finding a Pokémon to learn Flash could be challenging if you didn't want to sacrifice a move slot for a Pokémon already in your party. Shuffling from box to box trying to find a Pokémon capable of learning Flash was a chore. Without even making any progress through the mountain pass, Rock Tunnel already had the player against the ropes.
Once the place is lit up like a Christmas tree, the scope of the cavern comes into perspective. Hikers and Lasses are littered around every corner, ensuring your worn-down Pokémon never miss a battle. Onix and Geodude absorb attacks like a sponge. Then there is the constant threat of getting lost. The walls also contain a major condition that can break the will of anyone who enters. Zubats.
Annoyance is an understatement for these blind pests. With a 55-percent appearance rate, about every three steps lead to another encounter. With a high-speed stat and a life-sucking attack, they leave your team crippled one way or another. The constant barrage of Zubat after Zubat while trying to navigate a natural maze leaves you running around in circles while crippling your spirit and team. The very powerful and distinct hate for these bats is born in these brown pixel walls.
After a perilous journey, you are greeted with the wonderful light at the end of Rock Tunnel. Standing at the foot of Lavender Town, which happens to have a cemetery, you take a look back and pray that you never have to enter its depths once again. The cave is a soul-draining hike that many new trainers black out in and have to be dragged to the nearest Pokémon Center.

Doki Doki Literature Club kind of threw me for six. I played it to completion with my boyfriend, for once, and that framed the game in kind of unfamiliar light. I wasn't sure if it was really 'made for me', as the effect it has would surely be much greater on someone dealing with issues I'd say I've dealt with in the past and help them grow as a person.

Kathryn Thompson is an elderly employee who has worked at the Acorn coffee shop on the Elon University campus for the past ten years. She has one dream: to take her family to Disney World.
Elon students Taylor Zisholtz and Lucy Smith-Williams heard about Kathryn's dream when they patronized the Acorn late one night and struck up a conversation with her. Lucy and Taylor had never met before, but when they heard Kathryn describing her wish to take her kids and grandkids to Disney World, they moved to the same table and started to formulate a plan.

“I moved my stuff to Lucy's table, and we were just brainstorming ideas because I looked at her and was like, ‘We're doing this, we can do this, we have to do something,'" Taylor told The Pendulum.
The two started a GoFundMe campaign to raise enough money for Kathryn to take her son, daughter-in-law, and two grandsons to Disney World (which the girls estimated to be roughly $6,000).
Amazingly, it only took three days for the girls to raise $6,500.
Taylor attributes the generosity to Kathryn (and the coffee shop) being a campus favorite.
“Everyone knows Acorn, everyone eats their cookies, everyone's been there a million times,” Taylor told The Pendulum. “It's Elon, it's their school, it's their stomping ground, it's something they can link to and it's doing good for someone, and who doesn't like doing good?”
The girls presented the gift to Kathryn, along with some bags of Disney goodies and a poster from the GoFundMe page with all the kind comments about Kathryn.
Kathryn couldn't stop weeping tears of joy upon receiving the amazing gift. "Are you serious??"
Taylor wrote an extensive thank you to everyone on the GoFundMe page update:
I have said it before but we just truly had one of the most shocking days today as we witnessed the love and generosity pour in from across the country. Kathryn is an exceptional person and deserves every ounce of love she is receiving. We just wanted to make it totally clear that every cent of donation is headed to make Kathryn's trip as incredible as we can possibly make it for the whole family. The messages, shares, like, texts, and all the other forms of sweet words and encouraging thoughts are so, so appreciated by both Lucy and myself. Not one message has gone unnoticed, every kind word has made us smile from ear to ear.
We're not crying, YOU'RE crying! *sniffle*

WASHINGTON, Dec. 1 – Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), ranking member of the Senate Budget Committee, took to the floor today to lead the Democratic opposition to the Republican budget.
“The last thing we need is a budget reconciliation bill that throws 17 million Americans off of health insurance and denies nearly 3 million women the health care they need by defunding Planned Parenthood,” Sanders said.
At a time when the United States is the only major country that does not guarantee health care as a right, the proposed budget would gut the Affordable Care Act and continue the Republican “witch-hunt” against Planned Parenthood.
Sanders called instead for a responsible budget that reverses the massive transfer of wealth from working families to the top 1 percent, stops skyrocketing prescription drug prices and puts millions of Americans back to work. He questioned why the Republican budget does not provide paid family leave, raise the minimum wage to a living wage or make college affordable for all.
“The reason why the American people are angry and the reason why the Congress is so unpopular, is that the Congress is not addressing the real problems that are impacting their lives each and every day,” Sanders added. “At a time when the rich are getting richer, poverty is increasing, and the middle class has been in a 40-year decline, we need a budget that improves the lives of all Americans, not just the people on the top.”

At this year's South by Southwest (SXSW) in Austin, people chew on freely distributed Go Cubes — caffeinated gummy candies — as they kill time between talks with titles like “Brand Strategy” and “Event Solutions”.
SXSW has become a tech conference with music. The organizers of the first SXSW festival could never have predicted the sheer volume of wearable tech at an event designed to recover lost revenue from teen drinking.
Technology trade show at SXSW, 2014 © SXSW
You heard that right: SXSW was started to help out local bars and clubs after the law on teenage alcohol consumption changed. “When the legal drinking age in Texas rose to 21 in 1986,” writes sociologist Jonathan Wynn, “it took a significant revenue stream away from music venues, stirring concerns over how to nurture the city's small but vibrant music scene.”
The year before, a group called the Austin Music Advisory Committee (AMAC) had formed to address what they saw as the city government's indifference to its vital music industry. AMAC, which consisted of local musicians, critics, venue owners and record industry workers, compiled a white paper called “Austin Music: Into the Future.” The report recommended that Austin change its slogan to “The Live Music Capital of the World” and organize an annual music festival.
The Austin Chamber of Commerce heard them out, but wasn't sold on their suggestions. That is, until the 1986 drinking age hike put a dent in local music venues' revenue and a hole in local musicians' pockets. After all, Austin's a college town, and most college students are under 21.
When the law went into effect, AMAC became even more vocal. A musician named Troupe Earnest Gammage III — who had played in a band called The Sweetarts with local alt-country music icon Townes Van Zandt — led the charge. He started negotiations with the city, and finally got them to accept the report's suggestions. Gammage was instrumental in the hybrid conference-festival idea: He wanted to not only showcase Austin musicians and labels, but teach them how to thrive. The first seminars were primers for local artists on basic banking, taxes and legal issues.
The inaugural SXSW happened in 1987. The festival sold only 700 tickets at $10 to $15 a pop. The lineup was Texan through and through: cosmic cowboys from West Texas, Chicano punk from San Antonio, Dallas psychobilly and Austin slacker rock. The keynote speaker was Huey Meaux, aka The Crazy Cajun, a record producer from Louisiana.

The Austin Chronicle gave a glowing review: “All in all, an impressive beginning for SXSW and a sturdy groundwork on which to build a balanced conference tradition — level-headed, sober discussion countered with six or seven hours worth of the real live thing.”
Twenty-nine years ago, local country artist Hal Ketchum sang tender tunes from his debut album Threadbare Alibis on the neon-lit stage of the historic Continental Club. This year, attendees can hear about “mobile workout textiles for electro muscle stimulation” in a modern conference center. It's been a wild ride for SXSW. And none of it would have happened without the teenage booze ban of '86.
A sharp decline in the numbers of church-goers and new baptisms over the last century in Europe has been called a "crisis of faith" by many religious leaders. Now that crisis is ballooning into a full-blown exodus, as thousands flock to new websites offering "de-baptisms," according to Voice of America.
The idea of getting "de-baptized"-- or having your name officially deleted from the baptismal registry-- is relatively new, but one which the Catholic Church is beginning to take seriously, and with grave concern.
The movement may have begun just a decade ago when Terry Sanderson, head of the National Secular Society in Britain, posted an unofficial "de-baptism certificate" on the society's website, mostly as a joke. To date it has been downloaded at least 100,000 times.
"It was a joke to begin with, but now it has taken on a new significance because there are so many people who are anxious to leave the church that they are actually taking it seriously now, and they want some way to make their break with the church formal," Sanderson told VOA. "Often the church won't acknowledge their desire to leave."
Many disenfranchised ex-parishioners have begun to take it a step further, seeking official, legal acknowledgement for de-baptism. For instance, 71-year-old Frenchman Rene Lebouvier recently filed a lawsuit against the church after his initial request to have his name crossed off the church's baptismal registry was denied. Last October, a lower court in Normandy ruled in his favor, making him the first man to be officially de-baptized, though a local bishop has filed an appeal.
Last year in Germany, a record 181,000 Catholics formally split from the church by legally opting out of paying state church taxes.
Christian Weisner, a spokesman for the international grassroots We Are Church movement, says he blames much of the de-baptism movement on public anger about church pedophilia scandals, though acknowledges that official church doctrine has also swayed against public opinion on many political issues, such as abortion, homosexuality and married priests.
"They are thinking about leaving the church and there might be one special event, like the pedophilia crisis, like a [conservative] announcement by the pope, and then they decide now is the time to go," Weisner said.
The movement shouldn't come as a surprise to the church, as official figures have shown a steep decline in religious participation in Europe over the last several decades. For instance, only about one in three French children are baptized today, compared to 90 percent half a century ago.
According to religion professor Philippe Portier of the National Center for Scientific Research in Paris, the church has put in place a new evangelizing strategy to more strongly encourage parents to get their children baptized.
Such a proactive strategy may be for naught, however, if de-baptisms continue to increase.
Anti-church sentiment rises in Europe as more people seek 'de-baptism'
Websites offering informal 'de-baptism' certificates have ballooned to accommodate the increasing number of people who want to be removed from official baptisma
The Banking Crisis Cometh
The bank failure scene in the U.S. turned a shade uglier over the weekend. By this time tomorrow, it'll probably be even worse.
For starters, Guaranty Financial of Texas went belly up late Friday and secured a spot in the history books. With $13 billion in “assets,” the bank is the third largest to fail this year and tied for the 11th biggest bank failure in U.S. history.
Even more interestingly, the FDIC brokered Guaranty's assets to Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria, a bank from northern Spain. We're surprised on two fronts here: 1) That a bank from Spain — strapped with double-digit unemployment and a wretched housing bust — wants to bring their euros to I.O.U.S.A. 2) That BBVA already has a huge presence in Texas. With this acquisition, they will be the fourth largest banking chain in the Lone Star State. That could be an interesting trend to watch.
Three other banks failed along side Guaranty: CaptialSouth, First Coweta and ebank. That brings the yearly total to 81.
This should put the FDIC's deposit insurance fund on its last legs. At the beginning of 2008, the FDIC's bank failure war chest had over $52 billion. At the end of the March 2009, the last time the FDIC has given us a look into the DIF, they had $13 billion left. 60 banks have failed since, including Guaranty and Colonial, which by themselves took out half of that remaining $13 billion. Only the FDIC can say with accuracy if there is any money left, but this chart gives you a pretty good idea of how the trend is shaping up:
The DIF does have a source of income — it taxes member banks a significant “insurance fee.” But we have to think that the DIF is still in bad shape, perhaps even empty… and that the FDIC will soon be hitting up someone (Tim Geithner, Joe Taxpayer and/or U.S. banks) to refill their coffer.
The FDIC will provide their second-quarter report tomorrow, which among other things will include a look into the DIF and their infamous bank “problem list”… could get ugly. We'll keep you up to speed.
“Recent bank failures remind us of the problem loans festering on small and regional bank balance sheets,” writes Dan Amoss, “and that many of them are marking loans at fantasy levels. The secondary market value for some of the worst loans, like construction loans, is 20 or 30 cents on the dollar.
“There's a backlog of at least a few hundred insolvent banks that need to be shut down and sold into stronger hands. Bank stock bulls are ignoring the credit losses yet to be recognized, so there are lots of shorting opportunities in the sector. Many banks will not be able to “earn their way out” of their credit losses.
“The problem is, there aren't many strong buyers with lots of capital out there. Those that are, like private equity groups, are buying only after the FDIC agrees to eat most of the credit losses, and the buyer is gifted with the remaining shell — the profit-making engine of spread lending.
“It's understandable that the FDIC doesn't want much publicity about the Deposit Insurance Fund; it wants to maintain the public's confidence that it can ‘insure' all deposits with just a few basis points of capital reserves and skimpy premium income. The fund is clearly not adequate to cover the bank failures still in the pipeline, so we'll see another ‘special assessment' imposed on all other banks, which will ultimately be passed on to depositors via lower interest rates.”

A 16-year-old boy has denied carrying out a string of acid attacks on six moped riders.
The teenager, who cannot be named because of his age, is accused of targeting the men to steal their bikes, spraying them in their faces with a noxious liquid. He will stand trial in January.
He is said to have stolen two mopeds in the attacks, spread over 90 minutes.
Police said one victim suffered "life-changing injuries".
The defendant, from Croydon, south London, appeared at Wood Green Crown Court on Friday and pleaded not guilty to 12 charges relating to the attacks on 13 July in north-east London.
The offences include six counts of throwing a corrosive liquid with intent to "disable, burn, maim, disfigure or cause grievous bodily harm", two counts of robbery and four counts of attempted robbery.
The youth was remanded in custody until the trial on 8 January.
We read the phrase all the time, even if we've long since relegated it to the part of our brains that processes parental warning stickers or emergency-landing procedures: MADE IN CHINA.
China, for most of us in the West, is where things are manufactured, and here on the other side of the Pacific is where those things get bought. That organization of the world is a way to make sense of the big changes we see: America's deindustrialization, the rise of our tech and service sectors, and China's growing appetite for energy and resources. It is also a comfortable place to be: If you're the world's top consumer, then everyone else is worried about providing the things you want.
But what if the arrow were to turn, and China, brimming with a population of over 1.3 billion, started buying with a vengeance? What if China became the place that manufacturers looked for their cues?

That question is quickly turning from a what-if to a how-soon. Hundreds of millions of Chinese want the sorts of things we want — from televisions and washing machines to bottled water and organic food — and more and more of them are turning those wants into purchases. China's annual consumer spending is now around $4 trillion; though still only half the US figure, it is already a bigger consumer economy than Japan and close to that of the European Union. China is now the world's largest consumer in a number of categories, including beer, cigarettes, and — remarkably — cars. Some Western automakers have begun skipping US and European markets and debuting models in China first.

Karl Gerth, an East Asian studies professor at Oxford, has traveled to China many times in the past 25 years, building a body of research on China's consumer history and habits. He has amassed data and interviewed colleagues and strangers alike about what they buy, what they'd like to buy, and how it's all changed over the years. His latest book, “As China Goes, So Goes the World,” now out in paperback from Hill & Wang, documents China's massive shift in lifestyle and spending.
Gerth draws a picture of a consumer culture that in some ways remains vastly different from the West's. The state still plays a huge role in directing the manufacturing economy and prodding certain kinds of consumption. A long-held culture of saving means the Chinese are a long way from our comfort with credit and household debt. But some of the trends are familiar: Chains are spreading through the country; advertising is increasingly shaping consumer tastes across China's diverse regions; golf and skiing, formerly the provinces only of the super-wealthy, have begun to attract middle-class fans. And as a token of prestige, the classic Chinese liquor Moatai is swiftly giving way to a taste for cognac.
Gerth spoke to Ideas from his home in Oxford, England.
IDEAS: Why do we need a book on Chinese consumer habits?
Advertisement
GERTH: I've always been more interested in consumerism as a historical mover than large-scale bureaucracy. I was asked recently why so many Chinese are showing up in the UK, and why they can't stock the shelves fast enough with Louis Vuitton handbags. One of the reasons is that foreign brands are heavily taxed at home and Chinese believe that the products overseas are cheaper and less likely to be knocked off . . . .Consumer spending from Chinese has grown so much that it's prompted business interests to lobby governments to relax restrictions on Chinese travel.
IDEAS: How long before we stop thinking of China as the great producer, and ourselves as the consumers?
Oliver Haste Karl Gerth of Oxford University is author of "As China Goes, So Goes the World."
GERTH: It's in the early stages of that reversal. One very easy speculation for me to imagine is a time in the not-too-distant future when people go to China not because they want to see the Great Wall or the Forbidden City but for the best shopping opportunities. The best brands will be made for the Chinese market, available to the Chinese markets first, and will influence the global tastes and trends in fashion. Think of the Japan wave of the 1980s . . . in 2009, China became the world's largest car market. In 2010, it grew 40 percent over that. So they're the ones buying the cars and making the cars.
IDEAS: For the Chinese, it sounds like the “Made in China” label isn't necessarily something they like to see.
GERTH: In China, foreign always suggests better and more reliable. Over the 20th century, people tried to privilege Chinese products and branding Chinese-made stuff. All these institutions try to push people in that direction, but that doesn't mean it works . . . .About three years ago there was a big nationalist anti-Japanese student protest in Beijing; most of [the protesters] were carrying one Japanese electronic product or another. They were actively advocating to get Japanese products off the market, but using them at the exact same time.

IDEAS: What's the experience of shopping like for the average middle-class Chinese consumer, especially given the prevalence of counterfeit products?
GERTH: Anxiety is a major factor. You inspect stuff with a lot more attention. In China, they're constantly worried about these things being fake, whether it's handbags or medication....The old Chinese greeting of “have you eaten?” has been replaced with “how much did you pay for that?” or “where did you get that?” It's a real preoccupation.
IDEAS: But at the same time as there's this freewheeling street culture, it sounds like there's also firm state control.
GERTH: China is making sure that foreign multinationals don't own all the brands that people have brand allegiance to. They're not going to let nature take its course and the best mousetrap win out. That can happen either in building or buying national brands, or they can get Boeing, for example, to bring manufacturing and R&D over there, so even if the product is American, it's becoming less and less American all the time.
IDEAS: Beyond the urban middle class, China has a massive rural population. Are they part of the consumer class?
GERTH: In rural China I asked this guy whether he had heard of McDonald's and Kentucky Fried Chicken and he pointed to his television set. So even though he has no access to this stuff, it's still in his life. They're all starting to get the idea that they need fast food or bottled water or organic products, long before they have the actual ability or money to get it.
IDEAS: Is the ethic of saving keeping a lid on Chinese consumers?
GERTH: Rather than simply saying the Chinese are Confucianists and Confucianists save money, I'd say there are very specific things that make them anxious, and so they save money. So they save for a place to live, for their kids' education, for unforeseen medical expenses, and retirement. This is something that people who used to work for state industries never had to worry about, because it was provided. The state is now toying with the idea of reinstating these safety nets — not out of the goodness of their hearts, but to free up capital so that people will spend more money.
IDEAS: It sounds like a lot of what they buy isn't driven by practical concerns.
GERTH: There's been a huge uptick in costume sales to China from the UK, so I asked a Chinese friend why and he said, “Well, one of the ways in which you establish that you're not a redneck in China is one, how many countries have you been to, so people brag about the number of countries they've been to; and two, familiarity with Western culture, which includes a holiday like Halloween.”
IDEAS: So a new market and a new holiday?
GERTH: I have a picture somewhere from 1986, the first time I saw a Santa Claus holding the Communist flag of the PRC and my head almost exploded. Now it's commonplace there.
IDEAS: In the West, we're used to seeing products clearly made for our tastes and lives. Your book suggests that this may not last.
GERTH: My prediction is that the assumption that every product in the world is made for us and for everyone else it gets a slight modification is shifting over to China and the rest of Asia. For example, the back seats of cars are going to get a whole lot more luxurious and comfortable, because very few Chinese want to sit shotgun, especially given how dangerous their streets are, but the position of power and authority is usually in the back seat. Right now they're designed for children, but in China people sit in the back, and virtually everyone who can have a luxury car has a driver.
But there's also the other direction for it, where you've got this innovation in whatever realm, and it might drift back here . . . .My number one prediction about China that I didn't include in the book is that the Chinese people have endured so much unbelievable change, they're going to produce the next Shakespeare, the next Dickens, just due to all this tremendous change and turmoil. There could be this tremendous wave of innovation unleashing entrepreneurial opportunities. Scores of Sonys or Apples, that they're going to create all this stuff. Trends, fashion, art — you can certainly see it in the art world — that will change the world.

It took only a day for the Suns to regroup after losing to the Spurs in the 2005 Western Conference finals. Like everything during that era of Phoenix prosperity, the team's plans for the future moved in warp speed. Internally, the Suns imagined a new positional prototype for their high-octane system, to be unleashed in the following season. Point center, they called it. Amar'e Stoudemire, the 22-year-old future of the franchise, was to be its apostle.
“Once I polish my game a little more,” Stoudemire said, “I'll be able to take us to the promised land.”
I've thought about this an unhealthy amount for the past 10 years. I've come back to the same East Valley Tribune article year after year, revisiting the impenetrable optimism that somehow shined brighter amid defeat. I thought about it when Amar'e first left the valley in 2010 for New York. I thought about it in 2015, when Blake Griffin played the best playoff series of his career against the Spurs, and when LeBron James and Draymond Green stepped up as centers for their respective teams in the Finals the first time around. I thought about it during the Warriors' unprecedented winning streak at the start of last season.
And I'm thinking about it now, only a day removed from Stoudemire's decision to retire from the NBA at 33, after 14 years in the league. The point center concept (or at least its modern iteration — shout-out to Bill Russell) has gone from being a conciliatory gesture, intended to keep Stoudemire happy at the 5, to becoming not only a reality, but a damn near necessity in today's NBA. There is a thrill in seeing an idea come to fruition; a melancholy, too. Changes in attitude mark the passage of time as vividly as anything.
Of course, I think about Amar'e Stoudemire: Point Center so often because it is a figment of my imagination that I never mustered the will to bury. Four months after Phoenix gave a sneak peek into a brave new world, doctors discovered a lesion only a centimeter wide in the articular cartilage of Stoudemire's left knee. He would miss all but three late-season games in 2005–06; the point-center template would be filled by Boris Diaw, who was tacked on as a consolation in the Joe Johnson sign-and-trade with the Hawks. The Suns would rise again, and so would Amar'e, but he'd never have that season — the true follow-up to one of the most dominant individual performances ever seen in a playoff series, the season that scared the wits out of both Tim Duncan and Gregg Popovich.
Stoudemire averaged 37 points and 9.8 rebounds in five WCF games against the Spurs, with Duncan as his primary defender. After Game 5, Pop was asked if anyone had ever done to the Spurs what Amar'e had done. “Never,” he said. “I don't know what to do with him. I mean, he's just unbelievable. He's a real unique player. He's only going to get better. I don't know how.” In the Tim Duncan era, no one has ever had a better playoff series on a per-game basis against the Spurs than Stoudemire; if you include their three 2004–05 regular-season games, no player has ever played a better season on a per-game basis against the Spurs. And now no player ever will.
In the final 10 seconds of the 2005 Western Conference finals, with the Spurs leading 101–93, Stoudemire grabbed a rebound off a Manu Ginobili missed free throw and took the ball coast to coast himself. He executed a hesitation crossover on Duncan, and scored at the rim with minimal resistance. Duncan inbounded the ball, the final buzzer sounded, and he and Stoudemire immediately embraced. Duncan patted him on the chest and told him, you played a heck of a series and there will be plenty more times that you'll be back in this position.
Stoudemire would return to the Western Conference finals only once more, in 2010. A little more than a month later, he'd leave Phoenix for New York, the other career-altering decision in his life — but at least that time it wasn't nature deciding his course for him. Maybe that's why he chose to retire as a Knick — maybe it didn't have anything to do with where he was most successful, but where he felt the most control over his own person.
But I choose to remember Stoudemire in the days after losing Game 5; in the moments at his apex, where the precarious intersection of raw potential and raw productivity gave us the gift of the perfect Shawn Kemp, the Stromile Swift that our dreams had us believing in, or, if we want to keep this local, a blend of Charles Barkley's imposing physicality and Richard Dumas's world of talent, before the fall. The 22-year-old who had already become the league's most physically dominant player, and still was growing into himself. I'll remember Stoudemire in those summertime moments when you realize it can get better, when you believe it can only get better.

Should private commercial companies be advertising on B.C. government websites?
It's a question the Federation of Mountain Clubs of BC is raising after ads for Coleman Canada, an outdoor gear company, were spotted on the BC Parks site. The ad links to the company's online store.
Steven Jones, a volunteer with the club, said he first noticed the ads in June.
“We noticed that the ads started appearing on the BC Parks website, the big banner ads on individual park pages,” he said.
For Jones, it raises questions about commercial companies advertising on taxpayer-funded websites.
“I think that it's really important that we keep an independence between the park system and between commercial ads,” he said.
Only Coleman sought to advertise on the BC Parks site.
Coleman Canada is owned by Atlanta-based Newell Brands. Their Canadian division is headquartered in Toronto.
The Ministry of Environment says Coleman Canada was the only company to approach them about site advertising in 2016. That information wasn't immediately available on the government's website, and wasn't widely known prior to Global News making inquiries.
According to the ministry this kind of corporate sponsorship is nothing new for BC Parks, adding the money from these agreements is put towards park enhancement.
Good idea or slippery slope?
In an email, the ministry said “…all proposals are adjudicated following BC Parks Corporate Partnership Policy, which guides partnership decisions to ensure they are compatible with BC Parks values.”
The B.C. Director for the Canadian Taxpayers Federation said government should sell online ad space more often.
“I don't have any problem with it. In fact, I wish government would find more ways to get free money from corporations rather than relying on taxpayers,” Jordan Bateman said.
His only concern is about the submission and approval process and whether it's transparent enough.
“It shouldn't be hidden away on a website. It should be on BC Bid, which is the standard website for this kind of thing,” Bateman said.
However, NDP Environment Critic George Heyman says the move points towards the park system's chronic underfunding.
“I question whether commercializing parks or any other aspect of government operations is sound public policy that's in line with the values of British Columbians,” Heyman said.
As for Jones, he's worried about where he might see this kind of advertising pop up next.
“If you go to the Ministry of Finance website and they have ads from real estate agents or the Ministry of Health website and they had ads for pharmaceutical companies, I think there would be a lot of reasonable questions,” Jones said.
Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi speaks at a joint news conference with Australian Foreign Minister Julie Bishop at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Beijing, China, February 17, 2016. REUTERS/Kim Kyung-Hoon
BEIJING (Reuters) - Reports that China has deployed an advanced surface-to-air missile system to one of the disputed islands it controls in the South China Sea have been created by certain Western media, the country's foreign minister said on Wednesday.
Foreign Minister Wang Yi also told reporters he hoped Western media would pay more attention to the lighthouses China is building in the region. Taiwan and U.S. officials told Reuters and other media outlets on Wednesday that China had deployed the missile system.
At the same news conference, Australian Foreign Minister Julie Bishop, who is visiting China, urged restraint in the region and called on all sides to settle disputes peacefully, adding that Australia does not take sides on South China Sea claims.
China claims most of the South China Sea, through which more than $5 trillion in global trade passes every year, and has been building runways and other infrastructure on artificial islands to bolster its claims.
"It means there's an upper limit. If you set the ceiling high enough, 90 per cent of the population could be unaffected while the big claims would be knocked back," said Neil Warren, professor of taxation at the University of NSW. Not all workers gain the same benefits from negative gearing, analysis shows. Credit:Louie Douvis Australia is unusual in imposing no total ceiling to the amount of deductions that can be claimed, meaning some claims exceed 100 per cent of income. Tax Office statistics for 2012-13 show 55 of Australia's highest earners paid no income tax during that year. All earned at least $1 million and managed to write their taxable incomes down to below the $18,200 tax-free threshold. Although most Australians claim only small deductions, Australians with multiple negatively geared properties are able to claim large proportions of their income.
While pledging to continue to allow negative gearing, Treasurer Scott Morrison told Parliament last week that the government was prepared to look at "areas where the system is being abused or areas where they are excessive". Professor Warren said harsher rules applied in many of the countries to which Australia compared itself. The United States imposes a minimum tax rate below which deductions could not reduce tax, Canada allows only specifically leglislated deductions and New Zealand allows negative gearing, but not work-related deductions. In a submission to the Parliament's inquiry into tax deductibility the Treasury pointed out that Britain much more tightly limited the type of claims that could be made. Rental losses could only be offset against other rental income. Work-related deductions had to be incurred by every holder of that form of employment. "It is not enough that one employee, or a subset of employees, happens to incur the expense," the submission said. Work-related deductions amounted to $19.8 billion in 2012-13. Rental interest deductions amounted to $22.5 billion. The cost is believed to have climbed since with the spread of electronic lodgement.
In a paper being considered by the Treasury, Professor Warren suggests Australia adopt Britain's model of applying a global limit to all deductions including those related to work, health, negative gearing, the cost of managing tax affairs and gifts and donations. Figures from 2010-11 showed a cap of $50,000 or 25 per cent of income, whichever was the greater, would affect only 0.9 per cent of landlords and only 1.3 per cent of those incurring a rental loss. A lower cap of $12,500 would affect 9 per cent of landlords and 14 per cent of those incurring a loss. Professor Warren said the level of the cap would be a political decision. The important thing was to wind back excesses without affecting most taxpayers' ability to claim deductions. Follow us on Twitter Follow Peter Martin on Facebook

The EU executive on Tuesday announced that it was taking Hungary to court over three contested constitutional reforms which it argues violate European Union law.
"We have just decided to launch infringement proceedings against Hungary on three points," said European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso.
The European Commission is set to issue three letters of warning to Prime Minister Viktor Orban's government, demanding that it scrap the three reforms or face legal action.
The EU views the recently passed Hungarian legislation as threatening the independence of the country's central bank, as well as the judicial system and its data protection authority.
"We will use all our powers to make sure that Hungary complies with the rules of the EU," Barroso added.
The EU is pressuring Hungary to change the legislation
Pressure piled on government
Public anger over the legislation sent tens of thousands of Hungarians onto the streets in protest earlier this month. The new laws also provoked the suspension of talks with the EU and International Monetary Fund to secure a credit line for some 20 billion euros ($25 billion) for the cash-strapped nation.
Tuesday's EU ultimatum is the first step in a legal process that could eventually see Hungary dragged before the European Court of Justice for violating fundamental democratic rights.
Standard procedure is to give a member state two months to rewrite contested legislation, but in Hungary's case that period may only be 14 days, an EU official said.
Prime Minister Orban is due to defend his government during a debate in the European parliament on Wednesday.
"We will not allow the international left to accuse Hungary with lies and unfounded slander," Orban's spokesman Peter Szijjarto said in a statement.
Orban said he was ready to meet some of the criticisms from the IMF and EU.
"Concerning points made over the new law on the central bank, the Hungarian government agrees with some of them and I see no obstacle in adopting them. However, there are other points where our positions are still far apart," Orban said.

The power of vitamin C could one day be harnessed to fight colorectal cancer, according to a new study published in Science.
The equivalent of 300 oranges' concentration of vitamin C killed colorectal cancer cells. The equivalent of 300 oranges' concentration of vitamin C killed colorectal cancer cells.
Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common cancer in the US, with about 93,090 new cases each year.
Around 50% of those cases involve mutations in the KRAS and BRAF genes; these forms of the disease are more aggressive and do not respond well to current therapies or chemotherapy.
Vitamin C is generally thought to improve health because of its antioxidant effect, which prevents or delays some types of cell damage.
However, a team led by Dr. Lewis Cantley, of Weill Cornell Medicine in New York, NY, discovered that in the case of the KRAS and BRAF forms of CRC, the opposite was true. In these cancer cells, high-dose vitamin Cs caused oxidation, resulting in what could be a beneficial effect for patients.
They found that in cell cultures and mice, high doses of vitamin C - equivalent to around 300 oranges - impaired the growth of KRAS and BRAF mutant colorectal tumors.
They now hope that the findings could lead to the development of new treatments and provide critical insights into who would most benefit from them.
Trojan horse effect
In an oxygen-rich environment such as human arteries, a fraction of vitamin C, also called ascorbic acid, becomes oxidized and is transformed into a new compound called dehydroascorbic acid (DHA).
Scientists have known for some time that a specific membrane protein, known as glucose transporter GLUT1, enables both glucose and DHA to enter cells, but that ascorbic acid cannot do so. What DHA does once inside the cells remained a mystery.
The current study reveals that DHA acts as a Trojan horse. Once inside, natural antioxidants in the cancer cell attempt to convert the DHA back to ascorbic acid; in the process, these antioxidants are depleted, and the cell dies from oxidative stress .
Dr. Cantley explains that many normal cells express GLUT1, but KRAS- and BRAF-mutant cancer cells typically have much higher levels, since they need a high rate of glucose uptake for survival and growth.
KRAS- and BRAF-mutant cells also produce more reactive oxygen species than normal cells, and so they need more antioxidants in order to survive. This combination of characteristics makes these cancer cells particularly vulnerable to DHA.
More research needed
Since vitamin C affects cellular functions in various ways, not only as an anti- or pro-oxidant, the impact of high-dose vitamin C on normal and immune cells will need to be examined.
Dr. Cantley comments:
"This is not a therapy that you would want to wander into blindly without knowledge of what is going on in your tumor."
However, researchers are optimistic that they now have a mechanistic rationale for exploring the therapeutic use of vitamin C to treat KRAS- or BRAF-related CRC.
They believe the study could lead to the development of new biomarkers to help physicians determine who the treatment would suit best.
The insights may also be useful for other difficult cancers that express high levels of GLUT1 transporter, such as renal cell carcinoma, bladder cancer and pancreatic cancer.
Dosage route would most likely be through intravenous injections, as oral doses are not absorbed efficiently enough in the intestine to achieve the high serum concentration of vitamin C needed to cause toxicity to these cancer cells.
In other recent research, human clinical trials testing for toxicity have shown good safety profiles for intravenous infusion of vitamin C at doses that converted to similar levels of serum as the trials in this research.
Medical News Today recently reported on report from the World Health Organization concluding that processed meats can lead to colorectal cancer.

The idea that the events of the comic book The Killing Joke by Alan Moore and Brian Bolland, never intended as an in-continuity comic, but controversially treated as canon by the rest of the comics – had never actually happened. Were but memory implants. And, while Barbara Gordon was still incapacitated physically, it wasn't at the hand of The Joker, in an attempt to drive her father mad.

Well in the upcoming Batgirl & The Birds Of Prey out this week… it does suggest that the events of The Killing Joke did, actually happen.
Maybe…
We shall see…

So huge swaths of the electorate seem to have finally decided that peevish gump David Cameron isn't the convincing statesman they never quite thought he was in the first place. Still, he had a good innings. People often criticise Cameron's judgment, but no matter what you think of his policies, his ability to surround himself with decoy pillocks was a strategy that, until recently, paid dividends. Since coming to power in 2010, voters have been so busy hating Nick Clegg, Andrew Lansley, Liam Fox, George Osborne, Francis Maude and now Jeremy Hunt, there's been very little rage left over for Dave.
Getting round to properly abhorring him has seemed like too much bother, like an unwelcome, nagging chore. You see his face on the news and perform a 1,000-year-long internal sigh. Yes, yes. I'll detest you in a minute. I've got to finish detesting all these other people first.
But now his decoys are spent. Clegg, in particular, absorbed so much bile, he underwent a startling physical transformation: from buoyant Geoffrey-off-Rainbow type to watery-eyed totem of misery. It was as if he had somehow been bitten by a radioactive puddle. He's so depressing to look at, they really should erect some kind of protective awning whenever he's out in public, like they do around grisly human remains. Hating him isn't simply a cliche; it actually feels vaguely cruel. So he's no longer of much strategic use to Cameron.
Ditto Lansley, who provided months of angry distraction in the run up to the NHS reforms, but now seems like a villain from last year's movie. Attacking Osborne is far more fashionable. The trouble for Cameron is that he's fused with Osborne in the public brain: a high-born pantomime horse with two back ends. The tittering double dips.
Add to that the rising whiff of sleaze emanating from Leveson, which is finally beginning to curdle in the air around Cameron, and little wonder he has been losing his temper in a series of rather pathetic outbursts, like a man instigating a minor road-rage incident after rear-ending a milk float with his bumper car.
The further Cameron's stock slides, the less unelectable Ed Miliband appears. Miliband, unfortunately, looks and sounds like a dork. And not just any dork either, but the dorkiest dork in Dorking; someone you wouldn't cast as a dork in a drama-documentary for fear of looking implausible. But in a fight between the school dork and a dim, angry prefect with a warped sense of entitlement, only an absolute sodpot wouldn't root for the dork.
Assuming, that is, said sodpot had bothered paying attention to the scrap in the first place. If neither side really grabs you, you might just stay at home, like the majority of people last week. Only nine people actually voted in last week's local elections. Nine. And three of them only followed the signs to the polling station in the hope it was some sort of knocking shop euphemism. The low turnout has been blamed on bad weather, which was almost certainly a factor – but on the other hand, if you won't vote because of drizzle, you weren't that arsed in the first place. People will queue in the rain to see Kasabian in concert. They'll queue in the rain to enter Abercrombie & Fitch. They'll queue in the rain for any old shit, as long as it isn't democracy.
Someone recently told me that politics enjoys a level of media attention that's seriously disproportionate to its actual relevance or popularity. It should really only get about as much coverage as golf does, they argued. Both golf and politics have a core of hardcore fans surrounded by a healthy-sized cloud of casual followers. But most of the population doesn't really give a toss unless there's a big personality involved.
The more I think about it, the more that analogy rings true. The problem for politicians is that their chosen sport looks increasingly weird and arcane in the present day – like water polo or lacrosse. The uniforms are antiquated, the rules are stifling, the action is boring, and they're constantly terrified of upsetting their sponsors. The spectators don't understand the lingo, don't think there's much skill involved, and suspect the game's rigged anyway.
Increasingly, in order to succeed, MPs have to transcend the sport entirely by becoming celebrities first and politicians second. As Boris Johnson and George Galloway indicate, the public responds when it encounters a strong flavour, simply because it at least has flavour. In Edinburgh's Pentland Hills ward, an independent candidate calling himself Professor Pongoo – who claimed to come from outer space and campaigned inside a giant penguin costume – won more votes than the Liberal Democrats.
Jarvis Cocker recognised that the best way to turn your weaknesses into strengths is to magnify them: rather than trying to disguise his inherent gawky perviness, he accentuated it at every opportunity until he became a star. Maybe if Miliband overly emphasised his slightly peculiar and nerdish persona it would pay dividends. If he started collecting Magic: The Gathering trading cards and riding to the Commons on a little blue tricycle, with his knees all sticking out like a doofus.
After all, the more Cameron drops his guard and displays his temper, the less robotic and the more true to himself he seems to appear. Except in his case, that's a problem. No wonder he always used to come across as a robot. His software was trying to keep him in check. And much like public enthusiasm, that licence has now expired.

A suicide bomb attack has killed at least 70 people at a hospital in Quetta in south-west Pakistan, officials say.
About 120 others were injured in the blast, which happened at the entrance to the emergency department where the body of a prominent lawyer shot dead earlier on Monday was being brought.
The casualties included lawyers and journalists accompanying the body of Bilal Anwar Kasi.
A faction of the Pakistani Taliban has said it was behind the bombing.
Jamaat-ul-Ahrar said it had also carried out the earlier attack on Mr Kasi, who was president of the Balochistan Bar Association and had been shot while on his way from his home to the main court complex in Quetta.
Witnesses described scenes of chaos after the hospital blast, with "bodies everywhere" and survivors shouting for help through the smoke and dust.
Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif and chief of army staff Gen Raheel Sharif have both gone to Quetta and will hold talks with security officials.
Gen Sharif met some of those wounded at the Quetta Civil Hospital.

Mr Sharif expressed his "deep grief and anguish", adding: "No-one will be allowed to disturb the peace of the province. The people, policy and security forces in Balochistan have given sacrifices for the country."
The president of Pakistan's Supreme Court Bar Association, Syed Ali Zafa, denounced the assault as "an attack on justice". The Pakistan Bar Council has announced a nationwide strike by lawyers on Tuesday.
The Chief Minister of Balochistan, Sanaullah Zehri, said those injured should be given the best medical treatment and facilities available.
Image copyright EPA Image caption The blast broke several hospital windows
There have been a number of targeted killings in Quetta and the victims in recent weeks have included several lawyers.
Mr Kasi had strongly condemned the attacks and local media said he had announced a two-day boycott of court sessions in protest at the killing of a colleague last week.

Those killed in the hospital attack were said to include Baz Muhammad Kakar, a predecessor of Mr Kasi as provincial bar president, and 17 other lawyers.
Two journalists have also been identified among the dead - Shahzad Khan, a cameraman for Aaj TV, and Mehmood Khan, a cameraman for DawnNews.
Lawyers in Lahore staged a demonstration to condemn the attack. Some journalists also protested, demanding protection for freedom of expression.
Facebook has activated its safety check feature for Quetta, allowing users to mark themselves or others as being safe.

Ben Carson, left, talks with Donald Trump before announcing he will endorse Trump at the Mar-a-Lago Club on Friday in Palm Beach, Fla. | AP Photo Carson: GOP establishment tactics are 'disgusting and despicable'
Ben Carson says that the tactics the establishment of the Republican Party is using to try to derail Donald Trump are “disgusting and despicable.”
Carson rushed to endorse Trump, he told WABC Radio host Rita Cosby on Friday, because he feared that GOP elites' last-ditch efforts to stop him might succeed.
“I would call them disgusting and despicable, and I just hope that we can get some real leadership and not only the Republican Party, I mean Democrats, too,” Carson said. Asked why he endorsed Trump so quickly, he said that "seeing the intensity of activities by the political establishment against him, I began to realize that there was a good chance that they would succeed in derailing him and if that happened basically we've give the country over to socialists."
"There's no way I could sit there in good conscience and let that happen," Carson said.
Most people are more focused on who is on "Dancing with the Stars" than on what is going on in the country, he lamented.
Cosby asked Carson whether he'd consider a position as vice president.
"I won't completely rule it out,” he said, but revealed that he was looking more at an advisory role.
Carson said he's talked to Trump about some of his rhetoric and reinforced “the importance of appearing presidential.”
“I think he tried to do that last night,” Carson said, adding that Trump received the advice “graciously.”
Carson, who endorsed Trump during a neews conference Friday morning, said he had spoken to the other candidates by phone over the past week.
Before meeting with Trump to seal the deal on Thursday, Carson said, he was “already leaning in that direction.”
Slushy streets turned to slick ice overnight as a cold snap made for a hazardous commute Wednesday morning — but residents shouldn't expect the snowplows to be coming down their streets any time soon because the city says they aren't a priority.
"It is important for residents to remember that it is not in our plan to plow local streets, as is typical of primarily rainy-climate cities such as ours," Jerry Dobrovolny, the City of Vancouver's general manager of engineering services, told reporters Tuesday.
Traffic priorities
Taryn Scollard, the director of streets and engineering said Wednesday the city's snowplowing priorities are main arterial and bus routes.
"In the past we've steered clear of residential areas because of equipment challenges," said Scollard.
"With people parking on both sides [of the streets], it's quite congested, and so it was very difficult for us to get equipment down there without damaging vehicles."
The City recently bought smaller equipment for some residential streets and lanes — but they will only be deployed during extended cold snaps to help clear the way for garbage and green-bin collection vehicles.
A report to council in July shows Surrey, New Westminster, Seattle and Portland all have similar snow responses when it comes to residential streets.
(City of Vancouver)
High cost of snow removal
As part of the report, the city developed a cost estimate for full side-street snow removal. To meet that level of service would require a "five-fold increase in the annual snow readiness and clearing budget (up to $3.5 million instead of $0.78 million) and up to a $10-million, one-time investment in infrastructure, equipment and vehicles."
The City will be reviewing its 2017/2018 snow plan to evaluate whether updates or changes are needed for next winter once this season is over.
There's an app for that
Abstract. Change detection on multivariate time series has applications in various areas, e.g. health care and network monitoring. A common approach is to compare the divergence between data distributions of a reference window and a test window. When the number of dimensions is very large, this approach has both efficiency and quality issues. For instance, the window size needs to be large to ensure robustness, which further increases runtime and misses alarms. In this paper, we aim at tackling these issues and propose Light. In short, Light scales to very high dimensionality while providing flexibility in choosing the window size, to fit the level of details required. It works in three steps: 1) scalable pca for dimension reduction, 2) scalable factorization of the joint distribution in the pca space to lower dimensional distributions, and 3) scalable divergence computation using lower dimensional distributions. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world data show that Light outperforms state of the art, providing up to 100% improvement in both quality and efficiency.
Data is expected to show a substantial rise in homicides driven by just a few cities, and could give Donald Trump fuel for his ‘law and order' talking points
FBI to reveal likely murder spike on same day as first presidential debate
The FBI's national crime data for 2015 – which is expected to show a substantial overall increase in murders – will be released on the morning of the first presidential debate, likely providing a dramatic new talking point for Donald Trump.
For months, Trump has been pointing, ominously, to rising violence in Chicago and other cities, and arguing that Americans are at risk and that Democrats have failed black Americans in particular.
How large the nationwide murder increase might be for all of 2015 is still unclear, but some estimates would make the increase the largest since 1990, or even 1968.
Whatever the precise nationwide increase is, criminologist Richard Rosenfeld said, it will almost certainly be “a much larger rise in homicide than we've seen in many, many years”.
Trump, who has branded himself the “law and order candidate”, pledged in his July speech at the Republican national convention that “the crime and violence that today afflicts our nation will soon come to an end.”
“Inner-city crime is reaching record levels,” he tweeted in late August. “African Americans will vote for Trump because they know I will stop the slaughter going on!”
Barack Obama and other Democrats have pushed back that overall crime and murder fell to historic lows during Obama's presidency, and that the troubling murder increase has been concentrated in just a few cities.
Murders increased nearly 17% across the nation's 56 largest cities in 2015, Rosenfeld found in a justice department-funded study published in June. The increase was “real and nearly unprecedented”, Rosenfeld concluded.
Rosenfeld's study found the murder increase was mostly driven by an even smaller number of cities – just 10 – including Baltimore, Chicago, Milwaukee and Washington DC. Other cities, including New York and Los Angeles, continue to see murder numbers at or close to historic lows.
Even with a sharp national uptick in murders in 2015, violence in the US will still be at historic lows. The country is dramatically safer than it was in the early 1990s, when close to 25,000 Americans were murdered every year. In recent years, even as the population has grown, the number of murders has fallen to close to 14,000 a year.
While the steepest decrease in violence came in the late 1990s, murders have continued to fall during Obama's two terms, according to FBI data, with more than 2,000 fewer Americans murdered in 2014 than they were in 2008, the year before Obama took office.
An uptick in murders in the nation's 30 largest cities was not accompanied by spikes in overall crime or violent crime, a preliminary analysis of crime data by the Brennan Center concluded.
Rosenfeld projected that 2015's national increase could be as high as 13% – a very rough estimate, he said – while Inimai Chettiar, the director of the Brennan Center's Justice Program, projected that the increase might be between 6% and 12%.
If nationwide murders rose 6% over all of 2015, that would be the greatest single-year percentage increase since 1990, according to FBI murder data. If murders rose 13%, that would be the largest percentage increase in murders in the last half-century, larger even than 1968, when murders rose 12.75%.
But overall murders would have to spike 73%, not 6%, to actually put the US back at the record-breaking murder totals of the early 1990s.
At the same time, the murder increases in a few large cities have been devastating and historic.
In Baltimore, 130 more people were murdered in 2015 than in 2014, driving the city's homicide rate to its highest ever level. So far this year, Baltimore's higher levels of violence have continued, with roughly the same number of non-fatal shootings this year than last year through 2 September, and only a slightly lower number of homicides.
James Alan Fox, a criminologist at Northeastern University, said he was skeptical of how significant the murder uptick in 2015 might be.
“It's a one year increase ... and it's an increase from the lowest level we've had in 50 years,” he said. “To some extent, we're a victim of our own success.
“If you go on a crash diet and you lose 50lbs and then you put on a couple, it doesn't mean that you're fat.”
But Thomas Abt, a Harvard Kennedy School researcher who worked on violence prevention policy for the state of New York and in Obama's justice department, said he expected that the release of the FBI's 2015 data would “change the narrative” about urban homicide.
“It will be no longer possible to deny that the increase is real, significant, and nationwide in scope,” he said.
As urban homicide received more attention, he said, he hoped the conversation on how to address the problem would explore the relationship between gun violence, police reform, and mass incarceration.
“This is not a crime wave, as some conservatives say. This is a specific issue with urban violence,” Abt said. “I think it's quite appropriate to be concerned. It's not appropriate to panic.”
The same statistics that could bring more attention to the devastating violence in Baltimore and Chicago could also be used for fear-mongering, other experts said.
Overstating crime increases “drives unnecessary panic and fear, and people in the public, and politicians, don't make good decisions when it's coming from a place of fear as opposed to a place of reason,” said Chettiar.
“I imagine Trump will continue making the same statements that he's making, which have been exaggerating the increase in murders,” she said. “The one thing that I would hope is there would be more of an effort to fact-check him by the debate moderators or by Secretary Clinton.”
While the media has put Trump's crime claims in context, Chettiar said, she thought other politicians had not yet been forceful enough in questioning his analysis.
This is not a crime wave, as some conservatives say. This is a specific issue with urban violence Thomas Abt, Harvard researcher
“It's much harder to understand nuance than to just claim that there's a crime wave,” she said. “I think the appropriate response is to say, there are increases in select cities, we need to address the problems in these cities, but this is not a need for national alarm.”
“The data is probably going to be nuanced enough where there's wiggle room for both sides to further their agenda,” said Eric Piza, a former police department crime analyst and now an assistant professor at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice.
Because whatever increase the nation sees is likely to be driven by particular cities, the most appropriate response will be localized, Piza said, “rather than an across-the-board increase in law enforcement activity”.
Trump has described his preferred solutions to rising violence in the vaguest terms, saying last month that Chicago police could stop the city's nearly 50% murder increase “in one week” simply by being “tougher”.
Trump said he had talked to a “rough tough” Chicago cop who had described how to fix the city's murder problem. Chicago's police department responded by saying that Trump had not met with any high-ranking officer in the department, the Chicago Tribune reported.
Is the 'Ferguson effect' real? Researcher has second thoughts Read more
In July, Heather Mac Donald, a conservative writer who popularized the idea of the “Ferguson effect”, fact-checked Trump's claim in his convention speech that the rising violence was the result of the Obama administration's rollback of criminal enforcement.
“The federal government is usually only a marginal player in actual crime fighting, which is overwhelmingly a local function,” Mac Donald told the Guardian.
Stephen Fischer, a spokesman for the FBI's Criminal Justice Information Services division, said the fact that the presidential debate is on 26 September “was not a factor” in deciding a release date.
Several crime experts, including Fox, laughed aloud when they were told that the FBI's data released coincided with the date of the first presidential debate.
“It's always a Monday,” Fox said. “There's reason to believe it was a coincidence.”

NARAL has also issued a statement, here it is in full.
For Immediate Release Contact: Lisa SubeckApril 2, 2012 (608) 358-7090
NARAL Pro-Choice Wisconsin Statement on Incident at Appleton Planned Parenthood Health Center
NARAL Pro-Choice Wisconsin Executive Director, Lisa Subeck, released the following statement today in response to a reported explosive device that caused a small fire at an Appleton Planned Parenthood clinic. According to police reports, the device was found Sunday evening while no patients or staff were present, and foul play is suspected.
“In Wisconsin and across the country, it is unfortunate and unacceptable that reproductive health care providers must live with constant harassment and threats of violence while providing safe, legal medical care to women.
Today, our thoughts are with the staff and patients of Planned Parenthood's Appleton North health center, and we thank them for their commitment ensuring continued access to women's health care.
In the wake of this latest attack, we expect law enforcement to fully investigate this case and take steps to fully protect women's health care providers and their patients.
We also call on opponents of a woman's right to choose to condemn this action completely and absolutely. News of this attack comes just days after Ralph Lang was charged by federal authorities in a May, 2011, plot to shoot and kill Wisconsin abortion providers. Threats and incidences of violence against reproductive health care providers are unfortunately far too commonplace.”

The Post Crescent is now reporting the bomb was a bottle with chemical elements as well as "an incendiary agent".
Updated again. Politicians are starting to release statements on the "incident".
Violence is not an option in political disagreements
Rep. Bernard Schaber denounces bombing at Planned Parenthood Clinic MADISON – Rep. Penny Bernard Schaber (D-Appleton) released the following statement regarding the bombing
at Planned Parenthood: “The bombing of Planned Parenthood's Appleton North Health Center is truly a tragedy for the state of
Wisconsin. An act of violence is not free speech, and in fact restricts it. It is severely disappointing that people
would resort to violence to express their political beliefs. Violence is not an option for disagreements and
arguments on politics, policies, religion or anything else controversial. It is a sad day that violent acts have
occurred as a result of the bitter partisanship, the inflammatory remarks and the divisiveness of politics in
Wisconsin. “It is good to know that no one was injured by the explosion and that staff and patients are all safe,” said Rep.
Bernard Schaber, “It is disheartening and concerning that people would use a bomb to show their disagreement
with someone else.” “No matter how vehemently we may disagree on any policy, issue or election; violence is not the solution and
simply creates a larger problem,” said Representative Bernard Schaber. “I hope that this is not a sign of times
to come in Wisconsin politics. Let's get back to Wisconsin traditions and values by having open, honest, and
respectful debates on issues.”

#DumpKelloggs was the most popular trending topic on Twitter in the United States at the time of this writing after Breitbart News organized a boycott against the company on Wednesday.
Breitbart News organized the boycott after Kellogg withdrew their advertising from Breitbart News, claiming that the site and its conservative readers were not “aligned with our values as a company.”
The boycott, which has also taken place under the hashtag #DumpKelloggs, has generated thousands of posts on Facebook and Twitter, with the official Kellogg's Facebook pages for various products being bombarded with complaints from Breitbart's readers.
“We regularly work with our media-buying partners to ensure our ads do not appear on sites that aren't aligned with our values as a company,” said Kellogg's Kris Charles in a statement this week. “We recently reviewed the list of sites where our ads can be placed and decided to discontinue advertising on Breitbart.com. We are working to remove ads from that site.”
Breitbart News Editor-in-Chief Alexander Marlow encouraged the boycott of Kellogg's products, describing their war against Breitbart News as bigoted and anti-American.
“Breitbart News is the largest platform for pro-family content anywhere on the Internet. We are fearless advocates for traditional American values, perhaps most important among them is freedom of speech, or our motto ‘more voices, not less,'” declared Marlow. “For Kellogg's, an American brand, to blacklist Breitbart News in order to placate left-wing totalitarians is a disgraceful act of cowardice. They insult our incredibly diverse staff and spit in the face of our 45,000,000 highly engaged, highly perceptive, highly loyal readers, many of whom are Kellogg's customers.”
“Boycotting Breitbart News for presenting mainstream American ideas is an act of discrimination and intense prejudice,” he continued. “If you serve Kellogg's products to your family, you are serving up bigotry at your breakfast table.”
Breitbart President and CEO Larry Solov mirrored Marlow's response, branding the move as “un-American.”
“Kellogg's has shown its contempt for Breitbart's 45 million readers and for the main street American values that they hold dear,” said Solov. “Pulling its advertising from Breitbart News is a decidedly cynical and un-American act. The only sensible response is to join together and boycott Kellogg's products in protest.”
**UPDATE**
#DumpKellogs became the #1 trending topic in the U.S. on Twitter Wednesday evening.

Evan Spiegal, the chief executive officer of Snap Inc., the parent company of ephemeral social media platform Snapchat, has found himself in the eye of a storm and at the receiving end of Indian Twitterati's ire after reportedly saying Snapchat was not for 'poor countries like India'.
The 26-year-old Spiegal's unverified comments were published this week in a Variety report about a lawsuit that an ex-employee filed against Snapchat in the United States.
Anthony Pompliano, the former Snapchat employee, claims in his lawsuit that Spiegal once said, "This app is only for rich people...I don't want to expand into poor countries like India and Spain."
Never the ones to let a young billionaire from the West disparage the country, Indians back home took to Twitter to slam, ridicule and troll Spiegal, causing #snapchat, #boycottsnapchat and #uninstallsnapchat to trend on the social media platform on Saturday.
On Sunday, Snapchat appeared to have responded to the claim. The Hindustan Times quoted the company as saying, "This is ridiculous. Obviously Snapchat is for everyone! It's available worldwide to download for free."
THE LAWSUIT
Anthony Pompliano's lawsuit deals with Snap Inc. allegedly using inaccurate means to calculate metrics like daily active users (DAU) and user retention.
Pompliano stops short of accusing Snap Inc's senior leadership of deliberately inflating user metrics but says that higher-ups at the company were "completely misinformed" about important metrics.
Pompliano contends that during his three-week stint at the company, he discovered "a wide-spread, systemic failure in Snapchat's internal controls over its user data".
In his lawsuit, Pompliano claims to have uncovered evidence that the tools used by Snapchat were leading to the company claiming higher-than-actual numbers for metrics such as daily active users, month-over-month user growth and user retention.
Alarmed that advertisers were being misled by inflated numbers, Pompliano claims to have approached senior management with his concerns, but says was dismissed by them.
In 2015, the lawsuit says, Pompliano prepared a PowerPoint presentation for CEO Evan Spiegal.

'INDIA TOO POOR FOR US'
It was during the September 11, 2015 presentation when Spiegal allegedly made the comments that have so irked Indians on Twitter.
After going through the presentation on Pompliano's findings, Spiegal is said to have commented, "Yeah I read those, it doesn't matter."
Pompliano says he then brought up Snapchat's poor showing in Spain and India, both countries with high mobile penetration.
Responding to this, Spiegal allegedly said he was not interested in expanding "into poor countries like India and Spain", before storming out of the meeting.
A few days later, Pompliano says Snapchat fired him. He also alleges that Snap Inc. executives made disparaging comments about him to prospective employers.
Snap Inc. has labelled Pompliano a "disgruntled employee fired for poor performance" and who filed the lawsuit for publicity.
"The simple fact is that he knows exactly nothing about Snap's current metrics...He and his lawyers are - not to put too fine a point on matters - just making things up," the company's attorneys have said.
TWITTER RAGES
Once the Variety report came to light, #Snapchat became a trending topic on Twitter in India. Users initially slammed and trolled Spiegal for his alleged comments.
Soon after #uninstallsnapchat and #boycottsnapchat started to trend as people started extolling others to stop using the app.
Here are a few choice reactions:

No Dangal in Pakistan without the national anthem. And you thought Aamir Khan was anti-national?
……..thought I would live to see the day that a political commentator, in this case Simon Jenkins, admit that the British people are sovereign.
Voters surrender their sovereignty to MPs until the next election. Good, bad, sane or stupid, that is the rule, he writes. Well if that is the rule; and therefore representative democracy is not democracy per se, then it is about time the bloody rule was changed!
Jenkins continues: A quite different question is that of consent. No government in modern times has enjoyed majority consent of the electorate, let alone of the British people; in which case how can they legitimately have assumed office?
Yestersday the CoffeeHouse introduced this item by summarising thus: The Prime Minister says that Labour could not legitimately form a minority government if the party wins fewer seats than the Conservatives because it would represent only part of the country.
But hang on, in 2010 Cameron did not command the majority consent of the electorate, neither did the Liberal Democrats; and the Coalition Agreement most certainly did not command majority consent, purely because the electorate were never given the opportunity of agreeing it.
Now see what I mean when I have said this general election is an afront to democracy?
Surprise, surprise, another inmate released from the U.S. military prison in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba has been arrested for reengaging in terrorism. His name is Sabir Mahfouz Lahmar and his Department of Defense (DOD) file says he has links to “multiple terrorist plots” and as a member of the Algerian Armed Islamic Group (GIA) plotted with Al Qaeda to attack the United States Embassy in Sarajevo.
“Detainee advocated hostilities against US forces and the international community in Bosnia, and is linked to multiple terrorist plots and criminal related activity,” according to Lahmar's DOD file. “Detainee had intentions to travel to Afghanistan and Iran, and is reported as doing so prior to his capture. Detainee has demonstrated a commitment to jihad, and would likely engage in anti-US activities if released.” Lahmar ended up at Gitmo in 2002 because the Algerian government refused to take him into custody after Bosnian authorities exhausted the legal limits for detention. The Pentagon recommended continued detention and determined that he was a high risk that posed a threat to the U.S., its interests and allies. Lahmar was also labeled a “high threat” from a detention perspective and of high intelligence value.
Also of note in the DOD file is that Lahmar was on Saudi Arabia's payroll as an employee of the Saudi High Commission for Relief (SHCR), a non-governmental organization (NGO). He was arrested and convicted in 1997 for assaulting an American Citizen in Bosnia but was released, “after the SHCR intervened on his behalf,” the military file states. “After his release, detainee returned to work for the SHCR in Sarajevo.” Authorities in Croatia believe Lahmar was involved in the 1997 bombings in Travnik and Mostar and that he served in the el-Mujahid Brigade conducting training for acts of terrorism in the 1990s. Other reports link Lahmar to car theft and document forgery and indicate he's wanted in Belgium and France for his involvement in violent activities, the military file says.
Despite his disturbing Pentagon document, the Obama administration released Lahmar from the top security compound at the U.S. Naval base in southeast Cuba in 2009 after France agreed to take him. This week he was arrested in Bordeaux as part of a terrorist cell that operated a recruiting network for the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS). A British newspaper report says Lahmar was one of six people—four men and two women—captured as part of an aggressive crackdown on a jihadist recruiting network in the European nation that's been rocked by multiple terrorist attacks in recent years. Just a few years ago a former Gitmo captive, 46-year-old Moroccan Lahcen Ikassrien, was arrested in Spain for operating a sophisticated recruitment network for the Syrian and Iraqi-based terror group known as Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL).
Like Lahmar and Ikassreien, many of the captives released from Gitmo have predictably returned to terrorist causes and it has long been documented in military and intelligence assessments. Just last year a report issued by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) showed that of the 161 Gitmo detainees released by the Obama administration, nine were confirmed to be “directly involved in terrorist or insurgent activities” and that 113 of the 532 Gitmo captives released during the George W. Bush administration have engaged in terrorist activities. “Based on trends identified during the past eleven years, we assess that some detainees currently at GTMO will seek to reengage in terrorist or insurgent activities after they are transferred,” according to the ODNI, which is composed of more than a dozen spy agencies, including Air Force, Army, Navy, Treasury and Coast Guard intelligence as well as the Federal Bureau of Intelligence (FBI) and the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). The agency also stated in its report that “former GTMO detainees routinely communicate with each other, families of other former detainees, and previous associates who are members of terrorist organizations. The reasons for communication span from the mundane (reminiscing about shared experiences) to the nefarious (planning terrorist operations). We assess that some GTMO detainees transferred in the future also will communicate with other former GTMO detainees and persons in terrorist organizations.”
Other examples of recidivism among Gitmo captives include dozens who have rejoined Al Qaeda in Yemen, the country where the 2009 Christmas Day airline bomber proudly trained, and a number of high-ranking Al Qaeda militants in Yemen involved in a sophisticated scheme to send bombs on a U.S.-bound cargo plane. A few years ago, a Gitmo alum named Mullah Abdul Rauf, who once led a Taliban unit, established the first ISIS base in Afghanistan. In 2014, Judicial Watch uncovered an embarrassing gaffe involving an Al Qaeda operative liberated from Gitmo years earlier. Turns out the U.S. government put him on a global terrorist list and offered $5 million for information on his whereabouts!
As far back as 2010 former president Barack Obama's National Intelligence Director confirmed that one in four inmates released from Gitmo resume terrorist activities against the United States. A year earlier the Pentagon's Defense Intelligence Agency, which gathers foreign military intelligence, disclosed that the number of Gitmo prisoners who returned to the fight since their release had nearly doubled in a short time. The assessment was made by using data such as fingerprints, pictures and other intelligence reports to confirm the high rate of recidivism among the released prisoners.
I was very excited to see that my Arbitrary Day PLUS package arrived yesterday. I stayed home to rip it open, even though I was keeping my friends waiting. It was full of so many awesome goodies. My whole family was thrilled. My amazing Santa filled it with things that make her happy. They certainly made us happy.
The package contained:
Good Omens by Terry Pratchett and Neil Gaiman. I love this book and am excited to reread it.
A set of 30 beautiful Salvador Dalí postcards.
Some amazing pralines that my Santa made. Did I mention she's a pastry Chef?
Some beautiful earrings by an Etsy seller.
Samples of several wonderful smelling soaps from Etsy sellers.
Shark attack socks, which I wore today, in spite of the heat, and which garnered many compliments.
Stickers! Which my 3 year old loves.
Bubbles! Yay! They look like good ones.
Halloween glass markers and Frankenstein playing cards. Should be lots of fun.
Ginger chews. They are delicious and were appreciated this morning. I may have had one too many drinks last night.
An egg with a toy animal that grows in water. Both my kids were excited about this.
They were also excited about the various forms of candy which included: cola flavored pez, jelly bellies (my favorite), smarties (not the american kind), and apple pie gum (which looks delicious).
And a lovely note.
All in all, it turned my week from crappy to great all in 10 minutes. Thank you so much, tragersteit, you are a master Santa.
A routine of regular exercise is highly effective for prevention and treatment of many common chronic diseases and improves cardiovascular (CV) health and longevity. However, long-term excessive endurance exercise may induce pathologic structural remodeling of the heart and large arteries. Emerging data suggest that chronic training for and competing in extreme endurance events such as marathons, ultramarathons, ironman distance triathlons, and very long distance bicycle races, can cause transient acute volume overload of the atria and right ventricle, with transient reductions in right ventricular ejection fraction and elevations of cardiac biomarkers, all of which return to normal within 1 week. Over months to years of repetitive injury, this process, in some individuals, may lead to patchy myocardial fibrosis, particularly in the atria, interventricular septum, and right ventricle, creating a substrate for atrial and ventricular arrhythmias. Additionally, long-term excessive sustained exercise may be associated with coronary artery calcification, diastolic dysfunction, and large-artery wall stiffening. However, this concept is still hypothetical and there is some inconsistency in the reported findings. Furthermore, lifelong vigorous exercisers generally have low mortality rates and excellent functional capacity. Notwithstanding, the hypothesis that long-term excessive endurance exercise may induce adverse CV remodeling warrants further investigation to identify at-risk individuals and formulate physical fitness regimens for conferring optimal CV health and longevity.
Sailors stand on the German attack submarine U-33 before its participation in Dynamic Mongoose, NATO's anti-submarine warfare exercise held annually off the coast of Norway. Steven Beardsley/Stars and Stripes
BERGEN, Norway — Naval forces from 10 NATO nations and Sweden have gathered here to practice detecting and hunting submarines in an annual exercise whose real-world relevance has grown in the past year.
Dubbed Dynamic Mongoose, the training pits submarines from Germany, the U.S., Sweden and Norway against surface ships employing a suite of sonar, sensors and maritime air patrols.
The two-week exercise follows recent reports of foreign vessels in the territorial waters of several European nations, including an incident off Finland's coast last week and the spotting of a mystery vessel off Sweden last year. Although governments have not publicly blamed any country, they have left little doubt about their suspicion of Russia.
Naval officers speaking to reporters Sunday said the exercise isn't intended to send a message to any particular country.
“Obviously, we're aware of the incidents that have happened in some of our partner nations' waters,” said Rear Adm. Brad Williamson, who commands the Standing NATO Maritime Group 2 ships participating in the exercise. “I think for us what it does is it focuses our efforts and our training here.“
Since Russia's intervention in Ukraine last year, Sweden has moved closer to the transatlantic alliance, with which it has maintained a close partnership over the years. Some political leaders have even flirted publicly with the idea of one day joining NATO, though no formal steps have been taken in that direction.
Among the exercise's challenges is an unfamiliar North Sea environment, where cold temperatures and diversity of underground structures and wildlife will affect how submarines maneuver and are detected.
Participant ships work slowly at first, practicing and mastering certain tactics before beginning plugging into drawn-out scenarios, Williamson said. One focus may be protecting an oil tanker or supply ship that might make for an appealing torpedo target.
At their disposal will be maritime air patrols from Norway's Stavanger Air Base to the south and helicopters embarked aboard their ships, as well as sonar arrays towed behind their vessels.
NATO's research vessel, the NRV Alliance, will participate in the exercise for the first time, making the journey from its port in La Spezia, Italy, to test unmanned underwater vessels and sensor buoys meant to provide a fixed sonar signal.
New advances are aiding both sides in an old game of cat-and-mouse, said Kevin LePage, a program manager at NATO's Centre for Maritime Research and Experimentation. “It's been a technology race,” LePage said. “The sensors are getting better. The submarines are getting better.”
For Cmdr. Kai Nickelsdorf and his crew aboard the German attack submarine U-33, their advantage will be their knowledge of the underwater range. They are vulnerable when they rise to periscope depths, however.
The art of hunting submarines “is the most difficult task in all of naval and NATO tasks,” Nickelsdorf said.
Added to that difficulty is the complex nature of NATO operations, which rely on forces from different nations, cultures and languages to work on a common plain. Williamson, the commander of the naval group, said the only way to do it is in person.
“I'm going up against a thinking opponent who's going to do his best obviously to carry the day from his side,” he said. “That kind of interaction between the submarine forces and the surface forces in these kinds of waters is really what's the huge benefit of this exercise.”

A pipeline has spilled 200,000 litres of crude oil onto agricultural land on First Nations land northeast of Weyburn, Sask., the provincial government said Monday.
According to a government spokesperson, the Ministry of Environment was told late Friday of a pipeline leak into an area owned by the Ocean Man First Nation. The location of the leak was approximately 10 kilometres north of Stoughton, which is 62 kilometres east of Weyburn. The government said the ministry was notified as soon as the leak happened.
Two hundred cubic metres (200,000 litres) or just under 1,400 barrels of crude oil spilled onto the land. The government said the spill site is a “low-lying area with a frozen slough.”
“The spill is fully contained within the spill location and the oil is not entering any creeks or streams,” the spokesperson said in a statement.
Doug MacKnight, assistant deputy minister of the petroleum and natural gas division in the Economy Ministry, spoke with reporters Monday afternoon about Friday's spill.
He says that it appears the oil is contained to the low-lying land where it was discovered.
“That's the evidence on the ground yes indeed, but until all the work's done we won't know for 100 per cent. But for now it looks like it's been contained to the low area where the oil was discovered,” MacKnight said.
After the leak was discovered, the pipeline was shut down.

The Ocean Man First Nation and Environment and Climate Change Canada also learned about the spill on Friday evening. Chief Connie BigEagle of the Ocean Man First Nation has been at the site, the government spokesperson said, and will be told of repair/remediation activities.
Tundra Energy Marketing, which owns the pipeline, is leading the cleanup, which began on Jan. 21. So far, surface oil has been removed with vacuum trucks and as of Jan. 23, approximately 170 m3 (173,000 litres) had been recovered. Excavation of the affected line is expected to take place Wednesday. It will then be sent away for testing.
The government said environmental consultants are also at the site and are investigating.
At this time, the Saskatchewan government said local air quality and wildlife have not been affected.
Provincial officials found out about the leak on Friday, but the public wasn't notified until Monday afternoon.
MacKnight says this delay was because the government didn't know the volume of the spill until Monday morning.
“At that point we felt it was prudent to let everyone know what we were up to,” MacKnight said.
The government said the source of the leak will not be known until the site is excavated and the location of the breach is confirmed. Officials added this may take some time, as there are several pipelines in the area and they still need to confirm which one broke.
Last July, the Husky Energy pipeline leaked up to 250,000 litres of oil into the North Saskatchewan River.
Joe Morton has opened up about the Justice League as well as Cyborg movies, and it's pretty reassuring stuff.
Yes, a Cyborg movie is still happening! It seems like forever since the 2014 announcement of its plan was made (two years after we all died in 2012 remember?), but in an interview with Comic Book Movie, Cyborg actor Joe Morton has given us an update.
“As far as I know it is still happening,” he said. “I believe, although I'm not entirely sure, that it should start sometime around 2020. That seems to be a wonderful metaphoric year for these Cyborgs,” he joked.
That's good enough for me – in the vaguest way possible. Honestly it was getting to a point – especially after its complete exclusion from Warner Bros.' Comic-Con presentations – that I was beginning to wonder if everyone had just forgotten about it. But not me Brothers of Warner… not me.
It also came as part of the discussion around Morton's new contract deal, which is set to include the new Cyborg movie.
“It was set up as a three picture deal. The first being Batman v Superman: Dawn Of Justice, the second one being Justice League and the third one being the Cyborg film. So that's how it's been set up, but it's all contingent on how these movies do. And so far, Wonder Woman did really well, and we're hoping that Justice League does equally well.”
Joe Morton provided insight into the role and mindset of Justice League's Victor Stone
Speaking of Justice League, let's speak about Justice League. Morton plays Dr. Silas Stone, and was asked if Victor Stone feels any resentment towards him for turning him into Cyborg. The answer, in my very very humble and also incredible opinion, is really interesting.
“Yeah, some of that still exists in the film where Victor sort of feels like, 'yes you saved my life, but look what you made me look like,” Morton explained. “I can't go out and be a regular person.' He has no alias, nothing to hide behind. So what I think is great about that idea is you begin, in a metaphoric way, sort of talking about what it means to be “the other” in society. Even if you have something tremendous to contribute to society, the first thing that most social situations will do is ostracize you because you look different because they don't know who or what you are. So I think that's a big deal in this film for that character, and for Silas, and makes for interesting film making.”
Cool stuff. Let's hope the movie pulls through!

You suspect the wrong people: New wave of solidarity with detained anarchists in Minsk (Belarus)
Five actions in a row were organised on January 29 in support of anarchists, arrested in Minsk for alleged resistance to the police about a week ago. In fact all of them were detained on suspicion of participation in solidarity actions with other activists, who had been arrested at a punk concert and accused of distribution of extremist literature.
According to the activists, by these action they wanted to show that the 4 arrested people are not the ones who had organised the actions on January 16. The police and the judicial system don't aim at detecting or preventing crimes, to strive to suppress any demonstration of nonconformity.
One of the groups visited the judge who decided on the anarchists' cases and put leaflets around the house reading that he is wanted for unfair sentences and accusing a person known to be innocent. It's common knowledge that judges in Belarus act in accordance with demands of the police.
Another group made another picture at the police station with bare butts and a poster saying that the police again took wrong people. It was exactly the butt from the previous picture that is known to have infuriated the police last time.
Some posters were also billed around the city mimicking the design of a well-known social ad popularising the Belarusian language. Usually they depict someone naming a word in Belarusian and saying: “My first word in my mother tongue is Success”. Anarchists redesigned them and put the words ‘interrogation', ‘handcuffs', ‘arrest', ‘police car' instead. “Our first word is Freedom!”, the activists declare.
Another group hanged a banner on the bridge in the city centre saying “The destiny of the police is to create lawlessness”.
Some anarcho-nationalists also decided to express solidarity and hanged a banner “Freedom to political prisoners”.
It turns out that the police visits the arrestees almost every day, trying to bluff them with starting criminal cases for the actions that happened on January 16. That day several autonomous anarchist groups organised protest actions in three places simultaneously: at the Court where their comrades had been tried, at the Prison where they had been kept and at the Police station which had been in charge of the raid. There they made a picture with hands behind their heads to show their protest against the police raid at the New Year Punk Gig and the following detention of three people that were doing distro tables during the concert.

The Clinton campaign is on the defensive following two bombshell reports on Tuesday further revealing the secretary of state gave special access to Clinton Foundation donors. The latest bombshell, which was a review of the State Department calendars dropped by the Associated Press (AP) Tuesday night, found at least 85 of 154 people (or 55%) with private interests who either met or had phone conversations with Mrs. Clinton also gave to her family's charities.
“It's an extraordinary proportion indicating her possible ethics challenges if elected president,” AP staffers Stephen Braun and Eileen Sullivan said. In total, the 85 donors reviewed by the AP contributed roughly $156 million to the Clinton Foundation, which does not include U.S. federal employees or foreign government representatives. At least 40 donated more than $100,000 each, and 20 gave more than $1 million.
The AP report marks the first “systematic effort” to “calculate the scope of the intersecting interests of Clinton foundation donors and people who met personally with Clinton or spoke to her by phone about their needs,” they added.
A spokesman for Hillary Clinton pushed back hard on the AP following the bombshell report, even going so far as to tweeting out a demand for an editorial correction.
Hey @AP, this tweet is 100 percent factually inaccurate and remains uncorrected hours later. https://t.co/2wTLTRibnd — Brian Fallon (@brianefallon) August 24, 2016
“The story relies on utterly flawed data. It cherry-picked a limited subset of Secretary Clinton's schedule to give a distorted portrayal of how often she crossed paths with individuals connected to charitable donations to the Clinton Foundation,” Brian Fallon said in a lengthy statement. “The data does not account for more than half of her tenure as Secretary. And it omits more than 1700 meetings she took with other U.S. government officials, while serving as Secretary of State.”
Of course, there is simply no way to fact-check Mr. Fallon because the AP only reviewed the documents they were able to obtain, which they had been requesting from a stonewalling State Department.
Meanwhile, James Rosen, the chief Washington correspondent at Fox News, reported on Tuesday a review of State Department call logs revealed a senior executive at the Clinton Foundation left nearly 150 telephone messages for Mrs. Clinton's top aide at the State Department during a two-year period. Cheryl Mills, the longtime Clinton confidant who served as chief of staff for the entirety of Clinton's four-year tenure as America's top diplomat, received at least 148 messages from Laura Graham–then the Clinton Foundation's chief operating officer–between 2010 and 2012.
“No other individual or non-profit appears in the logs with anything like that frequency or volume,” Mr. Rosen's review found.
One of the messages Graham left for Mills, in August 2011, referenced “our boss” – without further identifying that individual. Another, from January 2012, appeared to reference former President Clinton, using his initials: “Please call. WJC is looking for her [Graham] and she wants to talk to you before she talks to him.”
State Department spokesman Mark Toner added that Ms. Mills and Ms. Graham never shared the same boss but insisted to Mrs. Rosen they “always” acted under Mrs. Clinton to advance U.S. foreign policy interests, “with no other intent in mind beyond that.” The telephone records were finally released by the State Department as a result of outstanding Freedom of Information Act lawsuit filed by the conservative advocacy group Citizens United.
“It's an amazing thing that the State Department spokesperson would actually make an argument that Hillary Clinton would be obligated under an ethics agreement that the White House made her sign with the foundation but her top employees would not be under that same agreement,” Citizens United President David Bossie said in a statement. “I find it's just very Clintonesque.”
Mrs. Clinton's opponent, Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, called for a special prosecutor to investigate the former secretary and the Clinton Foundation. Speaking in Akron, Ohio earlier this week, Mr. Trump was commenting on separate documents obtained by Judicial Watch that revealed special access was granted to Clinton Foundation donors, including the crown prince of Bahrain. Mr. Trump followed up on his criticism of his opponent at a rally Tuesday night in Austin, Texas.
“Hillary Clinton is totally unfit to hold public office,” he said. “It is impossible to figure out where the Clinton Foundation ends and the State Department begins. It is now abundantly clear that the Clintons set up a business to profit from public office.”
RICHMOND — Chevron has funneled nearly $3 million into a trio of campaign committees to influence the Nov. 4 Richmond city election, including a nearly $1.3 million contribution on Aug. 8, according to newly filed campaign documents.
The committees, each a variation of Chevron's Moving Forward campaign, spent about $1.3 million on the Richmond mayoral and City Council races as of the end of September, much of it on attack ads targeting local officials who are critical of Chevron's local refinery.
Chevron's independent campaign contributions, which are unlimited under federal law, have come in two installments. In March, a Moving Forward committee received $1.6 million from Chevron, and $1.3 million came Aug. 8.
Chevron created the original Moving Forward committee in 2012 as part of a new strategy to advance its political interests in Richmond. Its full name is “Moving Forward, a coalition of labor unions, small businesses, public safety and firefighters associations. Major funding by Chevron.”
Moving Forward representatives listed on the campaign finance documents did not respond to calls seeking comment.
This year, Chevron created two new committees. One is “Moving Forward with Nat Bates for Mayor, and Donna Powers, Charles Ramsey and Al Martinez for City Council 2014, with major funding by Moving Forward, a coalition of labor unions, small businesses, public safety and firefighters associations. Major funding by Chevron.” It has received $1.4 million.
The other new committee is “Moving Forward, opposing Gayle McLaughlin, Eduardo Martinez and Jovanka Beckles for City Council 2014…” It has received $500,000.
The two newer committees spent about $1.3 million between Aug. 15 and Sept. 29 supporting mayoral candidate Bates and three City Council candidates, and opposing three City Council candidates. That figure is sure to grow quickly now that Moving Forward is running TV ads, expenditures for which have not yet been reported to the Richmond city clerk.
Since Jan. 1, “Moving Forward, a coalition …” has received $2,933,363.90 in contributions from Chevron. Moving Forward has also received $5,000 each from the Richmond Police Officers Association PAC and the Independent PAC Local 188 International Association of Firefighters.
Some observers think Chevron's involvement in the Richmond election overwhelms the voices of regular Richmond residents by bombarding them with shiny mailers, billboards and television attack ads.
“You have a pretty big red flag when you have a multimillion-dollar corporation getting involved in a local election,” said Sarah Swanbeck, a campaign finance transparency advocate with California Common Cause. “The average Richmond citizen is not equipped or able to fight back with their own resources.”

A Supreme Court ruling requiring employers to accommodate workers who wear articles of clothing for religious reasons is a victory for more than just the young Muslim woman who wanted to work at Abercrombie & Fitch, several activist groups said Monday.
In an 8-1 vote, the high court sided with Samantha Elauf of Tulsa, Oklahoma, who was 17 when she applied for a sales position at a mall outlet for Abercrombie Kids, part of the trendy clothing chain. Even though Elauf didn't tell the person interviewing her for the position — called a "model" in Abercrombie's terminology — that the black headscarf she wore reflected her understanding of Islam, Justice Antonin Scalia wrote the firm "knew — or at least suspected — that the scarf was worn for religious reasons" and should have asked if there was a religious accommodation issue to the company's dress standards.
Groups representing a variety of faith traditions praised the ruling.
Citing the 1964 federal law banning discrimination on the basis of religion, the Baptist Joint Committee's general counsel, attorney K. Holly Hollman, said the ruling asserts religion shouldn't be used to disqualify any job seeker.
"The court today confirmed the fundamental principle in Title VII's ban on religious discrimination in employment. Neither a person's religion nor the potential need to accommodate a religious practice should be a basis for denying a prospective employee a job," she said in a statement.
The Council on American-Islamic Relations, which says it is "America's largest Muslim civil liberties and advocacy organization," also applauded the ruling in an emailed statement.
"The Supreme Court rightly underscored that a job applicant's religious beliefs and practices must play no role in an employer's hiring decision," said William Burgess, CAIR's senior staff attorney. "A company engages in illegal employment discrimination when it decides not to hire someone out of a desire to avoid accommodating his or her religious needs, confirmed or not."
Members of America's Sikh community, who are sometimes confused with Muslims because of the turbans worn by Sikh males, also supported the ruling, a Sikh Coalition statement said. The group's attorney, Gurjot Kaur, said Elauf's court win "is an enormous victory for the Sikh American community. We applaud her courage and conviction to practice her faith fearlessly and it reminds us all that our rule of law protects that."
Rachel Laser of the Religious Action Center of Reform Judaism said Jews in this country can understand the Elauf case based on their history in the United States.
"As Jews, we have historically known the insidious nature of religious discrimination — including workplace discrimination," Laser said in a statement. "The recent climate of Islamophobia further highlights the importance and significance of (the Elauf) decision."
Earlier this year, after the Supreme Court heard arguments in the Abercrombie case, the Deseret News noted the many difficulties an employer can face when interviewing a job applicant who might arrive at an interview in a specific type of religious clothing, but does not voice the need for religious accommodation.
In his opinion, however, Justice Scalia was unambiguous: "An employer may not make an applicant's religious practice, confirmed or otherwise, a factor in employment decisions."

Ash is then seen with a Poké Ball. After that, he is riding on the back of a Lapras with Pikachu while a Gyarados and Dragonair are seen jumping out and in the water. Next, Ash and Pikachu are looking at Pallet Town. It cuts to a scene with them walking, and then Ash throws a Poké Ball with a Pidgeot inside. The Pokémon then begins battling with a Fearow.
Ash appears looking at the screen, when Misty and Brock appear on either side of him. This is followed by Jessie and James rising up in front of them. Koffing, Meowth and Ekans jump up next, followed by Gary holding a Poké Ball. Ash and his friends are seen running from the rain. This is followed by a short clip of Nurse Joy, Professor Oak, Officer Jenny and Delia Ketchum.
The next scene shows Ash and his friends in Viridian Forest. Then, Ash and Pikachu are seen running with an Arcanine and a Rapidash. The latter Pokémon jumps up, and the three Legendary birds are seen flying in the sky. A clip of Mewtwo and Mew in space is shown, followed by Ash in a stadium holding a Poké Ball. His friends appear with him.

Flavor Technique: enhancing lentils with a Tarka
Lentils – collectively called daal – are a staple in South Asian cuisine – many families serve them every day at dinner with rice, naan, or chapaati.
Since lentils are such a simple food (and since there are often leftovers that you have to enhance for the next day), it's all about maximizing layers of flavor. Onions, garlic, and any spices that are cooked into the lentils will mellow as the daal simmers. So, right before serving, we pump up the impact by adding a highly-flavored oil to the daal.
Here's what you do for a traditional tarka to put over an South Asian daal. This is my dad's technique!
1. Heat a neutral oil (canola, peanut, etc.) or butter, or a mixture of both until hot but not smoking.
2. Add your flavors – any combination of what you have around.
Start with some fresh basics (slivered ginger and garlic, thinly sliced onions, sliced green or red chilis) and cook just until fragrant. If you're using fresh onions, cook them until they're browned before adding the garlic and ginger. You can get packets of fried onions from Indian/Pakistani stores that make this process quicker and result in a deeper taste.
Then add whole spices (brown cumin seeds, black cumin seeds, coriander seeds, dried curry leaves) and cook until fragrant. As you put them into the hot oil, crush them a little with your hands to release the flavors.
You don't want to use any fresh herbs unless they're very solid things (no cilantro). If you'd like a bit of a sour note, finish with some lime or lemon juice.
3. Now you have two options: some people pour the hot daal into the hot oil and then pour into a serving dish. Some people pour the hot daal into a serving dish and then pour the hot oil on top of it. Both result in an intense spicy-savory kick to an otherwise calm daal.
All of the spices and flavorings I mentioned above are optional and variable – learning the technique of flavoring the oil is more important than memorizing exactly what to put in it.
This will work with many pureed or creamy soups as well – just use the same techinque of putting hardy herbs and spices into a hot oil, and mixing it into the soup. Imagine a rosemary and/or sage tarka over a pumpkin or white bean soup, or a chipotle and cumin tarka over a creamy tomato soup. Explore!
Russian criminals have stolen 1.2 billion Internet user names and passwords, amassing what could be the largest collection of stolen digital credentials in history, a respected security firm said Tuesday.
There's no need to panic at this point -- Hold Security, the firm that discovered the theft, says the gang isn't in the business of stealing your bank account information. Instead, they make their money by sending out spam for bogus products like weight-loss pills.
The Milwaukee-based firm, didn't reveal the identities of the targeted websites, citing nondisclosure agreements and a desire to prevent existing vulnerabilities from being more widely exploited.
Hold Security founder Alex Holden told CNNMoney that the trove includes credentials gathered from over 420,000 websites -- both smaller sites and "household names." The criminals didn't breach any major email providers, he said.
A credential pair consists of a user name -- often an email address -- plus a password. There are roughly half a billion email addresses in the gang's collection, Hold Security says.
Holden said the gang makes its money by hacking into email and social accounts, posing as trusted friends and family and advertising bogus products. That means that if you see strange messages being sent from your email or social media accounts, you might be among those affected.
"It's really not that impactful to the individuals, and that's why they were under the radar for so long," Holden said. "They've ignored financial information almost completely."
Take the quiz: Can you outsmart a hacker?
But Holden said the gang's success at amassing passwords demonstrates that weak security procedures are common on websites of all sizes.
The criminals began collecting user data a few years ago by simply buying it on the black market. Their stash has grown significantly this year thanks to their use of an automated program that trawls the Internet to find vulnerabilities on websites, Holden said.
The reported theft dwarfs the one revealed last year by discount retailer Target (TGT), which admitted in December that hackers had stolen credit- and debit-card data from 40 million accounts.
Flipboard: Cybersecurity - how safe are you?
Hackers from Russia and Eastern Europe are known for launching sophisticated cyberattacks for financial gain. Beyond spam, organized crime syndicates in the region have engaged in more sophisticated activities like corporate espionage and the theft of credit-card details.
The extent of the theft shows people need to better manage their credentials, cybersecurity experts say. Most people keep the same password for multiple services, such as banking, email and social media accounts. That allows hackers to turn a single password database into a treasure trove.
Related: You've been hacked! Here's what to do
One simple way to stem the damage is to use two-factor authentication whenever possible to sign in to online services, said Eric Cowperthwaite, an executive at network security provider Core Security. This method requires you to enter a second password, usually generated by your smartphone, upon login.
Jay Kaplan, CEO of cybersecurity firm Synack, criticized the companies involved for not being alert enough about their own security.
"It's likely that most of them do not even realize how many times they've been compromised," he said.
The news of the theft was first reported by The New York Times .

Sheriff Moore denied the allegations in a written statement on Dec. 5.
“There have been questions recently about whether I have interfered with forensic investigations. That has never happened,” Moore wrote. “I would never try to influence or change the opinions of Dr Omalu or any pathologist working on a case.”
Omalu -- whose discovery of a deadly brain disease in professional football players was depicted in the 2015 movie “Concussion” -- said he accepted a job with San Joaquin County a decade ago to raise the standards of death investigations in a medically underserved community. But in his resignation letter, Omalu wrote that he was met with resistance from the start.
“I first experienced this with Sheriff Steve Moore when he prevented me from attending crime scenes which detectives from police departments of other cities may have wanted me to attend, or scenes I wanted to attend, especially on complicated and/or unusual cases,” Omalu wrote. “I believed this interference would stop the longer I stayed in the office and exhibited the highest and exemplary standards of practice. Unfortunately, it did not stop.”
Preventing Forensic Pathologists From Examining Crime Scenes
Concerns over the lack of participation of a forensic pathologist prompted a San Joaquin County prosecutor to write a letter to the sheriff in 2013.
“I hope that in writing this letter it brings to your attention how the failure to have the Forensic Pathologist come to the scene can have an effect (sic) on the prosecution of some cases,” Deputy District Attorney Sherri Adams wrote, referencing the Oct. 30, 2011, murder of Kathleen McGehee.
McGehee was discovered stabbed to death in her Manteca home on Oct. 31 of that year, a day when both her son Dawson McGehee and a daughter were in and out of the house.
'Dr. Omalu's ability to perform forensic pathological analysis to ascertain the time of death was significantly impaired.' Sherri Adams,
San Joaquin County Deputy District Attorney
The lead investigator asked for Omalu to examine the body at the house. The sheriff's office refused to send Omalu, and never told him about the request, according to Adams' letter.
A day later, Omalu performed an autopsy on McGehee in the morgue, but because of the delay and the refrigeration of the body, “Dr. Omalu's ability to perform forensic pathological analysis to ascertain the time of death was significantly impaired,” Adams wrote.
The district attorney charged Dawson McGehee with murder. During the trial, Adams wrote, the defense argued that the victim was alive on Oct. 31 and that someone other than her son could have killed her.
“There were members of the jury that entertained this theory as a reasonable possibility based on the evidence,” Adams wrote to Moore. “Thankfully the jury in this case was able to render a verdict of guilt; however, the date and time of death was a real source of debate during the five days of jury deliberations.”
Adams said she never received a response to her letter and doesn't know why the sheriff denied the request for Omalu to visit the crime scene. But, she said, she believes changes were made after that. In 2013, Adams prosecuted another homicide — and in that case, Omalu went to the crime scene, she said.
Moore said in a written statement Thursday that his office is "in the process of reviewing" Adams' 2013 letter, and that the general practice is to send pathologists to crime scenes once they've been requested by the investigating agency.
"This case is more than six years old," Moore wrote, "and staff assigned to the Coroner's Office at that time have either retired, rotated out, or are no longer working at the Sheriff's Office."
Canceling Doctors' Orders for Tests
Forensic pathologists Omalu and Parson also documented a number of times when they say the sheriff overrode their requests for additional tests.
Omalu cited a case where the decomposed remains of Lisa Ann Valdez, who had been missing for months, were found on June 8, 2016, also in Manteca.
Valdez's body showed evidence of toxic levels of amphetamine, but Omalu could not rule out other causes because the head and neck of her body were missing.
'A person who does not have a license to practice medicine in the State of California should not be involved in the medical evaluation of a case and provision of a medical opinion.' Dr. Bennet Omalu,
San Joaquin County Chief Forensic Pathologist (Resigned)
“I had to determine if she had been killed by someone or if she died as a result of some type of accident,” Omalu wrote in a memo sent to the county medical director on Oct. 1.
Omalu recounted that he ordered an anthropological autopsy that might provide further evidence. But months later, when he asked for that report, a sheriff's deputy told him that his request for laboratory analysis was “overruled” and “the skeleton was released to the family and cremated,” according to the memo.
“An incomplete autopsy undermines, and does not pass the reasonable degree of medical certainty threshold and standard,” Omalu wrote on his autopsy report. “I cannot provide an opinion in regard to the mechanisms of death and causes of death in this case.”
In his letter to the medical director of San Joaquin General Hospital, Omalu wrote, “A person who does not have a license to practice medicine in the State of California should not be involved in the medical evaluation of a case and provision of a medical opinion.”
Both doctors wrote that the sheriff's decision to cancel lab work amounted to the illegal practice of medicine.
Calls for Independent Investigation
San Joaquin County District Attorney Tori Verber Salazar said she was aware of the allegations before the doctors resigned and had launched an investigation “several weeks” ago.
A Dec. 12 post on the DA's Facebook page stated: “San Joaquin County Pathologists Dr. Bennet Omalu and Susan Parson have made our office aware of concerns in the operations of their office, and requested the District Attorney to investigate. The investigation has been initiated and is ongoing. When the investigation is complete, this office will review the facts as presented and make the appropriate decisions at that time.”
Some residents want an independent agency outside the county to investigate the allegations against Moore.
“I don't know how they could possibly investigate the sheriff's office regarding these cases because they're the ones that also handled all of the officer-involved cases” said Barbara Steward, a Stockton resident whose ex-husband, Daniel Humphreys, died in 2008 after being tased 31 times by a California Highway Patrol officer. “I'm not sure how they can be impartial.”
In notes sent to county officials this month, Omalu accused the sheriff of withholding a report generated by the Taser weapon the officer used. When DA Verber Salazar -- then a deputy prosecutor -- shared the Taser report with Omalu two years later, showing Humphreys was shocked for 2½ minutes, Omalu changed his findings in the case from accidental death to a homicide.
Steward, who was married to Humphreys for 13 years and had two daughters with him, was working for the sheriff when he died. She and Humphreys had divorced and she had remarried. Steward retired this year.
She said that after the doctors' allegations surfaced, she felt free to finally reveal what she knew about the night her ex-husband died.
“He (Moore) was aware of that case very early on when it was unfolding on scene,” Steward said. “As soon as that information (from the Taser) was downloaded -- which is a pretty instant thing -- I'm sure he was made aware of what that was.”
She said a apparent lack of follow-ups on that case by the district attorney's office still bothers her.
Now Steward wants the attorney general of California or some other independent agency to investigate the allegations against Moore.
“I think it needs to be handled by someone higher up,” Steward said.
In a statement this week, a spokesperson for Attorney General Xavier Becerra wrote, “To protect its integrity, we can't comment on, even to confirm or deny, a potential or ongoing investigation.”
Allegations Fuel Calls For Independent Medical Examiner
In response to the allegations against the sheriff, a growing number of physicians -- including the California Medical Association -- have urged the county Board of Supervisors to create a medical examiner's office run by physicians, who would determine both the cause and manner of suspicious deaths.
San Joaquin County, like the majority of counties in California, established a sheriff-coroner system for investigating sudden, violent or suspicious deaths, and all deaths involving law enforcement. Typically the coroner, who is also the elected sheriff, hires a forensic pathologist to conduct autopsies and determine the medical causes of death, such as a heart attack or blunt-force trauma. Then the sheriff determines the manner of death: accidental, suicide, homicide, natural or undetermined -- based on the autopsy findings and the investigatory findings of law enforcement.
Critics of the system say having an elected official determine the manner of death presents a conflict of interest, and creates a perception, real or not, that political pressure affected the outcome.
During the public comment period at a Dec. 12 county Board of Supervisors meeting, Dr. Grant Mellor of the San Joaquin County Medical Society urged supervisors to take immediate action to protect the independence of forensic pathologists performing autopsies.
“This is gaining national -- as well as international -- attention,” said Dr. Kwabena Adubofour at the same meeting, referring to reports and editorials in The Washington Post and texts he said he'd received from colleagues in London asking, “What's going on in San Joaquin County?”
DA Verber Salazar also urged the board to create a separate medical examiner's office.
Board of Supervisors Chair Chuck Winn said he's waiting for the county counsel to investigate the allegations and determine if any laws were violated.
Winn said it would be “irresponsible” to make decisions until the board has all the facts gathered.
“Certainly we want to make sure that everybody has an opportunity to provide their input or side as to what's occurred and maybe what needs to be done in the future,” he said. “I think it's a little early to make any decisions as to what we're going to do until we have a chance to evaluate what the costs or the consequences the reorganization would entail.”
The Santa Clara County Board of Supervisors, for example, voted last year to restore the independence of medical examiners following allegations that the sheriff had interfered with death investigations by withholding evidence and pressuring forensic pathologists to change their findings. The shift resulted in an annual $800,000 increase to the county budget.
Today we'll be looking at type programming in Haskell. Programming in type-land allows us to teach the compiler a few new tricks and to verify additional constraints at compile-time rather than run-time. The canonical example is that you can encode the length of a list as a type so that you can verify that appending an element to a list of n elements yields a list of n + 1 elements. If you haven't read about or experimented with an example like that before I'd say to check out Matt Parson's post on type programming first. We're going to go a step further and we'll actually encode the rules of a game of Tic Tac Toe into types so that we can statically guarantee that nobody cheats! If you're into spoilers you can see the finished code at the git repo here.
Type programming is a newly popularized idea, so the tools for it are still a bit rough (in Haskell at least), check out Idris if you'd like to see something a bit more polished.
There are some libraries popping up in the Haskell ecosystem which are making the ideas presented here easier to work with, most notably the singletons library which can generate a lot of the type-level primitives we write here. Check it out if you like, but I find it's a bit confusing for people new to this stuff, so I'll be spelling most things out in long-hand.
Let's get moving!
Here's a representation of the de-facto 3x3 Tic Tac Toe board:
Note that we'll need the {-# language DeriveFunctor #-} pragma for this.
We'll need a way to refer to individual squares in the grid so our player can say where they'd like to move. Let's just use simple (x, y) coordinates. We'll use a custom datatype rather than Int so that we know the coordinates are in bounds.
Here's a quick function which lets us change a slot inside a Triple:
And that gives us everything we need to place pieces on the board:
Looking good! But wait, there's really no validation going on here! Players could play on the same square over and over again! Or maybe player X just keeps on playing without giving O a turn! We could do error handling at runtime inside the function, but that would mean throwing runtime exceptions (Yikes!), running things inside an error monad, or returning an Either. But those are all boring and involve runtime checks so lets see how types can help do this work at compile-time!
Alternating Turns
To start simple and see if there's a way we could make X and O alternate turns! In order to do that we're going to need types which represent X and O !
Here's a first attempt:
Now we'd have types for each, but we get a conflict! We have duplicate definitions of X , O and N because of PieceT ! Let's introduce our next GHC extension: {-# language DataKinds #-} ! DataKinds takes a bit of fiddling with to understand, don't worry if you have a hard time understanding where the boundaries are. I still have to shake my head and think it through most of the time.
DataKinds let's you use constructors from any datatypes (defined with data or newtype ) as types! To reference the 'type' version of a data constructor you prefix it with an apostrophe. Since we already defined PieceT , by enabling DataKinds we now have 'X , 'O , 'N in scope at the type level! Technically you can leave off the ' if it's clear to the compiler that you're referring to a type, but I like to be explicit about it for readability.
There's one more bonus that DataKinds gives us, it creates a new Kind for each family of constructors. Kinds are kind of like types for types, most Haskell types are of Kind * , and higher order kinds are * -> * , you can check it in ghci:
That last one is interesting! GHC notices that 'X isn't quite like other types, but that it was defined as part of the PieceT data group. This means that when we're writing functions on types we can actually specify what Kind of types we want to allow.
The first and easiest thing we could require of our game is that X and O always alternate turns. In order to that we'll need to store who's turn it is as part of the type of our board. Let's edit our Board type to have an additional parameter called t for turn , we don't actually have to have the type in our data-structure though, the compiler will do the check at compile-time so we won't need to store this info at the value level. A type which is used only on the left side of a data definition is called a "Phantom type". They're useful for specifying type constraints.
We'll also edit the signature of newBoard to show that X goes first; we don't need to change the definition at all though!
When we do this we'll get a compiler error that GHC was expecting a type, but we gave it something of Kind PieceT . GHC usually expects basic types of kind * , so if we do anything fancy we need to let it know what we're thinking. In this case we can add a type annotation to the Board type:
The KindSignatures pragma lets say what 'kind' we want all our types to be. This makes GHC happy, and helps us too by allowing us to specify that the 't' parameter should always be one of our pieces rather than some arbitrary type.
Unfortunately, changing the type of Board has broken our play function. We need to put something in as a 'turn' parameter there too. For now it's easiest to split it up into a playX and playY function which can specify their types more concretely.
Don't worry about the duplication, we'll clean that up later. Now you can only playX on a board when it's X's turn! Huzzah! If you try it the wrong way around GHC will complain:
Pretty cool!
Preventing Replays
Now the real fun starts! Let's see if we can ensure that people don't play on a space that's already been played!
A simple X or O in our type isn't going to cut it anymore, let's bulk up our representation of the board state. Let's keep track of each place someone has played! We can do this by writing a type level list of coordinates and piece types:
Remember that we're using DataKinds, so now BoardRep is a kind and Empty is a type and so is Cons when it's applied to two Coordinates, a Piece type and another BoardRep . It'll keep recursing until we hit an 'Empty .
Now that we have a board representation, let's replace the t in our datatype with the type level representation of the board:
Now every time we play a piece we'll also represent the change at the type level, in order to do that we need to be able to get the "type" of the coordinates of each move. This is a bit tricky, since the coordinate values themselves are all of the same type CoordT and NOTHING is a member of the types A, B, or C.
This is where we start to introduce some hacks to get things to work. Say hello to GADTs!
This is going to look weird and strangely verbose to most of you; it's unfortunate that we need to do things this way, maybe someday we'll find a better way. You can also look into using the Proxy type from Data.Proxy , but it suffers similar verbosity issues.
Let me explain how this works, we've written a new type Coord which has a constructor for each of our Coordinate values, but each constructur also sets the phantom type parameter of the Coord to the appropriate type-level version of the coordinate. We've also written a function coordVal which translates from our wrapper type into the matching CoordT value.
Bleh, a little ugly, but now we can write some well-typed play functions:
If ViewPatterns are new to you, check out Oliver Charles' post to learn more.
Now we get both the type level coordinates AND the value level coordinates! Awesome. We're storing the played pieces in the type list now, but we still need to check that it's an unplayed square! We wouldn't be type programming without type functions, let's dive in! In Haskell type functions are called Type Families, but really they're just functions on types:
This is implemented as a linear search through the list looking for a match. If we ever find a matching set of coordinates in the list then we know we've played there already. Notice that type families also return a type, so we specify the Kind of that return value, in this case Bool , so the returned type will be either 'True or 'False .
Let's use this to write constraints for our play functions:
Now we're asserting that in order to call this function the board must not have played on those coordinates yet! If you haven't seen it before, ~ does an equality check on two types and creates a constraint which requires them to be equal.
We're close to done, but unfortunately in our upgrade we forgot to ensure that X and O always alternate!
Rechecking Alterating Turns
Checking whose turn it is with our new representation is easier than you might think; if the last play was X then it's O s turn, and in all other cases it's X s turn!
We also altered the constraints of playX and playO to reflect the requirement!
We're in good shape now! We can play a game!
Looks good to me! As an exercise try combining playX and playO into a more general play ! Here's a hint, you'll want to make another wrapper type like we did with Coord !
Here's the finished product all at once, it's also available as a stack project in a git repo here.:
That last type there is a doozy! The type actually includes the entire game board, and it'll only grow as we add moves! This exposes some issues with using this approach for a real-life tic-tac-toe game. Not only are the types unwieldy if you ever need to specify them, but the type is actually so well defined that we can't really write a function to use user input!
Give it a try if you don't believe me, we'd want something along the lines of:
String -> Board b PieceT -> Board ? PieceT
We'd parse the string into the coords for a move. It's really tough to decide what would go into the ? though, we can't give it a type because we don't know what the Coords will be until after we've already parsed the string! This is the sort of thing that's sometimes possible in Idris' dependent types, but is pretty tricky in Haskell. You can see Brian McKenna show how to build a type-safe printf in Idris if you're interested.
Thanks for joining me, let me know if you found anything confusing; hope you learned something!

Here's an on-foot look and comparison of the "Rainbow" a.k.a. "Multicolor 2.0" Flyknit racers. The left pair is the first MC colorway and the right pair is the second "Rainbow" colorway that drops Friday, September 11.
UPDATE (September 8, 10:30 a.m.):
Nike is giving people access codes if they went to a Nike Running Club event, and one of the sneakers involved in this process is the "Rainbow" Flyknit Racer.
UPDATE (September 4, 4:20 p.m.):
Following an overseas drop, Nike has confirmed a September 11 U.S. release for these highly anticipated Flyknit Racers.
@gettnguap The Flyknit Racer 'Rainbow' is set to drop on 9.11 at 10am ET. Keep an eye on our feeds for more details. — Nike.com (@nikestore) September 4, 2015
See original story from 6/16/15 below
Nike's Flyknit technology has led to some of the most innovative styles in recent memory, but few have had the impact of the popular "Multicolor" design.
Today, we got a preview of the newest look for the multicolor Flyknit Racer. Centered around vivid shades of purple, blue, and green, these are sure to be one of the dopest looks for summer. As usual, the unique patterns assure that no two sneakers will be exactly alike.
If you recall, a couple of weeks ago pairs of the 'Oreo 2.0' Racers dropped out of nowhere in London so hopefully these will pop up in stores sooner than later.

From public service broadcasting to the collection of our personal data, farmers' subsidies to the extradition of criminal suspects, the range of issues that the European Union (EU) regulates is vast. But what is there to prevent the EU from creating laws that endanger our rights such as free speech, privacy, or a fair trial? The Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union lists the rights that the EU is legally obliged to respect whenever it takes action. In 2010 Viviane Reding, Vice-President of the European Commission announced the adoption of a fundamental rights strategy, according to which “the Commission will verify that all EU laws are in compliance with the Charter at each stage of the legislative process.”
The three institutions involved in EU law-making (the Commission, Council and Parliament) have created their own internal rules to ensure that proposals for new laws are checked against the Charter. But two years on, recent research suggests that what goes on in practice, however, is another story. Even though there is a legal obligation to respect the rights in the Charter, compliance with human rights standards is still treated as a political issue that is up for negotiation, rather than a legal requirement. Recent negotiations on a proposed EU directive on the use of passenger name record data illustrate this starkly. The directive would require information on all passengers to be collected by airlines and transmitted to law enforcement agencies to be stored for a period of five years. This not only allows authorities to interfere with the privacy of passengers by monitoring their travel – even when there is no evidence to suggest that they have committed a crime. It also increases the risk that personal information could be lost, stolen or misused, such as for racial profiling of travellers. Even though the three main expert EU bodies on this issue (the Article 29 Working Party, the European Data Protection Supervisor, and the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights) all raised serious doubts about its compatibility with human rights standards, each of the institutions has pressed ahead with passing the legislation. If all the EU's institutions are supposed to be screening legislative proposals for compliance with the Charter of Fundamental Rights, why are laws that are not compatible with human rights standards still being adopted?
What goes on in practice in the EU's institutions?
The Commission, responsible for putting legislative proposals on the table, has been relatively systematic in implementing its own rules on checking for compliance with the Charter. Whenever major legislation is being considered, the Commission draws up an impact assessment to analyse its potential consequences on various issues, such as the environment or the economy. This assessment includes a “fundamental rights check-list”. But in practice the analysis is often very superficial. Worse still, at times relevant rights issues are simply not spotted at all. In a sense this is not surprising. One might not expect, for example, a civil servant creating policy on the internal market to realise that this could have a negative impact on the quality of care services delivered to the elderly. Such was the situation when the Commission proposed the Services Directive. This legislation was intended to make it easier for companies in different countries to compete with each other. The original proposal had included social services, which would have resulted in cheaper, poorer quality care services being provided by local authorities.
The Commission does have a potential second line of defence. Before it can formally adopt a proposal and send it on to the Council and the Parliament to negotiate, it must receive the endorsement of its own Legal Service. The Commission's Legal Service checks that the proposal would not involve the EU doing something outside the powers given to it by national governments, and should include a check for compliance with the Charter. Unfortunately, the opinions that it delivers are not published. The Legal Service is not meant to act like a court, but more like a lawyer advising a client. So it presents the Commission with an analysis of the risk that a proposal, if passed into law, could be struck down by the Court of Justice of the EU if a case were to come up. The only piece of evidence available – a leaked opinion of the Legal Service on a proposal concerning an agreement on passenger name record data between the EU and the United States – shows that serious concerns raised by its Legal Service were, in fact, largely ignored.
Once the Commission's proposals are sent on to the Council and the Parliament, these institutions may propose amendments – which should (in theory) also be checked for compatibility with the Charter. The Council of the EU, where national governments are represented, has its own set of guidelines to help diplomats involved in negotiations to check that any proposed legislation meets the Charter's standards. Many of the negotiations are carried out by diplomats in “working parties” that specialise in different areas of policy, such as criminal law or pharmaceuticals. There is even a working party on fundamental rights, as well as the Council's own Legal Service, which the Council's guidelines specify are available to provide advice to other working parties. But according to several diplomats, the guidelines are not actually put into practice and questions on human rights are put to the Council's Legal Service only occasionally. Human rights questions might be raised from time to time by a particular government – though often as a tool to block legislation that it opposes for political reasons. This may explain why diplomats cannot think of an occasion when the specialist working party on fundamental rights been asked for assistance by other working parties.
The Parliament has a strong track record of standing up for human rights, both inside and outside the EU. Many members of the European Parliament are receptive to the wealth of expertise offered by non-governmental organisations (NGOs). But the willingness of an MEP to make use of NGOs depends very heavily on his or her own political leanings. From time to time the Parliament has requested to the EU's Fundamental Rights Agency or external consultants to analyse the human rights issues raised by a proposal. But it simply does not have the resources to systematically screen legislative proposals or the amendments to those proposals put forward by MEPs.
The EU needs to take its commitment to human rights seriously.
One draw-back to current arrangements is even though the EU is legally bound to respect the Charter, it is not legally bound to follow a process of screening legislation, or of implementing the findings of any screening process. To make its obligation to respect the Charter effective in practice, the current internal rules need to be made mandatory and implemented systematically. Moreover, if a screening exercise leads to a conclusion that a proposal breaches the Charter, the institutions must implement this finding, and not simply treat it as a political factor to be considered during negotiations.
How could the EU do better?
One problem facing the Commission is the lack of expertise on human rights among civil servants preparing proposals for legislation. To turn all civil servants into human rights experts would require a level of training that is not feasible. But to make the opinions of the Commission's Legal Service publicly available could increase the accountability of the Commission when it chooses not to follow the advice given. It might also reveal whether the Legal Service itself has sufficient expertise on human rights, and in turn prompt it to recruit more staff in this area. The situation in the Council might be improved if its own guidelines on the Charter were implemented, and if the analysis of proposals and amendments were published, as they are in the Commission's own impact assessments. As for the Parliament, it could consider setting up a more detailed screening procedure along the lines of the Commission. This could take the form of opinions being delivered by an expert body to assist the Civil Liberties Committee, where most legislation with a significant fundamental rights angle is currently negotiated.
The EU could also look into more creative solutions to draw on the expertise of other bodies. The Fundamental Rights Agency, the EU's own expert human rights body, could be given a role in systematically screening legislative proposals—something that is not currently within its powers. Keeping in mind that the EU is also on course to join the European Convention on Human Rights, there is also room for greater cooperation between the EU and the Council of Europe. This could take the form of lawyers from the European Court of Human Rights being seconded to the EU institutions to boost expertise. The Council of Europe, which has a history of developing training materials, could also train EU civil servants to understand how their given policy areas, like the internal market or regional development funding, can have an impact on the rights protected by the Charter. Finally, the institutions could improve their cooperation with civil society organisations that have the expertise they lack. It is not unusual for NGOs to be excluded from the preparation of legislative proposals by the Commission. Similarly, negotiations in the Council are notoriously opaque and difficult to track. Opening up to outside expertise can only help the EU to improve the quality of its laws, and the ability of the EU to create legislation that can ‘promote the well-being of its peoples', which the Treaty on European Union states is one of the organisation's overarching aims. For now, Commissioner Reding's ambition that all EU law ‘must be fundamental-rights proof' is far from being realised.

PCR: A decade or more ago Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld claimed, as part of the “scare Americans to death about terrorism” strategy, that the prisoners in Washington's Guantanamo prison are “the most dangerous, best-trained, vicious killers on the face of the earth.” Rumsfeld's erroneous claim was endlessly repeated by the presstitutes and swallowed whole by the gullible American and European public.
Nothing could have been further from the truth. At the time, I pointed out that in fact the prisoners were innocents captured by warlords in response to Washington's offer of a bounty for terrorists and sold to the US for money. The prisoners consisted of aide workers, traveling salesmen, and any unprotected people that warlords happened upon. Washington needed “terrorist prisoners” in order to cloak its massive war crime.
I was correct, not Rumsfeld. After many years of torture and brutal treatment, and despite attempted kangeroo court military trials, almost every single prisoner, about 700 males, turned out to be innocent and had to be released without charges after losing a decade or more of their lives to being tortured by the Americans.
The US government has a long record of shameful behavior, and the 14-year-long torture of fake “terrorists” in Guantanamo defines the inhumane character of the US government and its presstitutes, people devoid of integrity and insensitive to justice. It also shows that the US government has no difficulty in finding a sufficient number of psychopaths in the US military, CIA, and among academic psychologists to do its dirty work in its torture dungeons.

CNBC editor Nikhil Deogun said members of the press needed to stick to facts and remind themselves that their readers "are not as ignorant, as stupid as we think they are" during a discussion Wednesday on media in the Donald Trump era.
In a panel moderated by Katie Couric at the Aspen Ideas Festival, Deogun and Wall Street Journal editor Gerard Baker, The Atlantic editor Jeffrey Goldberg, Time editor Nancy Gibbs, and USA Today editor Joanne Lipman delved into the challenges of covering Trump and declining trust in the news media.
In one portion, Couric brought up the problem of confirmation bias in the media.
"Consumers are increasingly gravitating toward outlets that basically tell them what they want to hear, reinforce their beliefs," she said. A friend of mine said they're seeking affirmation, not information. So given that, how do you restore trust in the media writ large if people are so divided about which media outlets are actually fair and accurate?"
Deogun said the media should not fall into the "trap" of applying one standard to one person and a different standard to everyone else. He pointed to his former Wall Street Journal colleague Paul Steiger's mantra that "in the end, stick to the facts."
"I think sometimes there's too much of a tendency to interpret a fact to a degree that it goes into opinion," he said. "And I think part of our job is to, again, remind ourselves that our … readers, viewers, users, are not as ignorant, as stupid as we think they are, and I think part of that is to be more transparent. Part of that is to be more forthcoming about what we know and what we don't know."
Full exchange:
No one is predicting a government shutdown at the end of the week, but few can say exactly how Republicans will get out of their latest jam.
Top White House officials are insisting the government-funding bill include billions for President Trump's “great wall” along the U.S.-Mexico border.
ADVERTISEMENT
But it's unclear how far they're willing to push the matter: The federal government will shut down early Saturday morning unless negotiators strike a bipartisan deal to keep the lights on.
Democrats say money for a border wall is a dealbreaker, and they have rejected talk of trading wall funds for a major Democratic priority that Trump has vowed to defund: federal subsidies for insurers who provide coverage to low-income ObamaCare enrollees.
While Trump has downplayed the importance of Saturday being his 100th day in office, a rare government shutdown on that symbolic day would represent a huge political black eye for the new president just weeks after his ObamaCare repeal-and-replace effort imploded in the House.
For now, the chances of a shutdown appear very low.
Trump said late Monday that he is open to getting border wall money in the fall.
The president reportedly made the comments to a group of political journalists.
GOP lawmakers and Appropriations Committee sources told The Hill it's looking more and more likely a short-term stopgap measure may be needed to keep the government open past Friday, especially given that House lawmakers return to the Capitol Tuesday from a two-week spring recess.
Either a one- to three-day continuing resolution (CR) or a seven- to 10-day one would buy time for a longer-term measure to fund the government through Sept. 30, the end of the fiscal year.
“My guess is a short-term CR is needed, particularly with the push to fund the wall,” a senior House GOP lawmaker told The Hill on Monday.
The source was one of a handful of GOP lawmakers who said Monday that they support Trump's push to fund the wall. They have noted that top Senate Democrats in 2006, including Barack Obama Barack Hussein ObamaWith low birth rate, America needs future migrants 4 ways Hillary looms over the 2020 race Obama goes viral after sporting black bomber jacket with '44' on sleeve at basketball game MORE, Joe Biden Joseph (Joe) Robinette BidenBannon: 'Zero' doubt Trump will run for reelection Bernie is back with a bang — but can he hold on to his supporters?

But the lawmaker acknowledged the GOP is in a difficult political position if it demands money for the wall at the risk of shutting down the government.
“We could win the debate on the border wall if we're only arguing about the border wall, but the problem with a big bill like this is you're almost never arguing about one subject,” the lawmaker said.
Rep. Tom Cole (R-Okla.), a senior appropriator, said the GOP's current predicament proves he was right when he urged his party during last year's lame-duck session to pass a funding bill through September.
“It was a mistake not to do this last November and December,” Cole said in a phone interview. Now, Democrats “have a lot of leverage” because Republicans don't want a shutdown when they control both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue.
“I hope our leadership and the administration learn a lesson” that spending bills should get done sooner, he continued. “Here we are in an artificial crisis that didn't need to exist.”
Trump has asked Congress for $1.5 billion this fiscal year so he can start construction of the wall, a central promise of his campaign. His 2018 budget request calls for another $2.6 billion for the wall.
The wall is a “very important tool in stopping drugs from pouring into our country and poisoning our youth,” Trump warned in a pair of tweets Monday. “If the wall is not built, which it will be, the drug situation will NEVER be fixed the way it should be! #BuildTheWall.”
White House press secretary Sean Spicer said Monday he could not “guarantee” there wouldn't be a shutdown after Friday, but added: “We feel very confident the government is not going to shut down.”
But as he's done in the past, Spicer would not say whether Trump would sign a spending bill that doesn't include money for the wall. The president answered the question very similarly in a recent interview with The Associated Press.
“I don't want to comment. I just don't know yet. I mean, I have to see what's going on. I really do,” Trump said. “But the wall's a very important thing to — not only my base, but to the people. And even if it wasn't ... the wall is very important to stopping drugs.”
Even some anti-immigration hard-liners in the House are careful not to tie Trump's hands and demand the omnibus include wall funding.
“This is clearly one of the key initiatives of the Trump campaign, and so I am sure that the president now wants to fulfill that promise,” conservative Rep. Dave Brat (R-Va.), a Trump ally, told The Hill.
“But I'm sure everyone recognizes that in the first 100 days, he is balancing a healthcare bill, a tax reform bill and a budget environment that has placed him in a very difficult position of turning the battleship around on a dime.”
As Republicans search for an escape hatch, some on the Hill are discussing a possible compromise with Democrats that could include more money for border security but not funds for a physical wall. That could include funds for more border patrol agents or surveillance drones.
Schumer, part of the quartet of congressional negotiators, said he believes the two parties can reach a funding deal by the end of the week.
But he blamed the White House for throwing a “monkey wrench” into the talks.
“If the administration insists on poison pill riders or extraneous funding requests, then our talks could get sidetracked, particularly if the administration demands funding for a border wall,” Schumer said in a speech on the Senate floor.
“Democrats have been long clear that the border wall is a nonstarter.”

“The first kind-of movie star we're supposed to see is the guy from Duck Dynasty. Well, that's great, but I mean, that's not exactly Bradley Cooper.”
That was CBS News's veteran political analyst Bob Schieffer last week deriding Donald Trump's D-list RNC—an event that was initially sold to the American public as a super-classy, star-studded soiree (Tom Brady! Ben Roethlisberger!), but ended up more closely resembling an episode of The Surreal Life, with Scott Baio, Antonio Sabato Jr., and the aforementioned homophobic mouth-breather from Duck Dynasty serving as the celeb guests of honor.
So, when the DNC rolled into Philly with its dance card of Lena Dunham, America Ferrera, Alicia Keys, and our greatest living actor, Meryl fucking Streep, many Trumpsters had sour grapes, knocking the event for going Hollywood—despite the fact that the RNC desperately tried to attract A-listers and failed, Trump is a former reality star, Republican God Ronald Reagan an ex-Hollywood actor, you get the picture.
Enter Bradley Cooper. During Wednesday night's edition of the DNC, the cameras constantly cut over to the hunky, Oscar-nominated actor—and his glorious hiatus-beard—seated next to his current girlfriend, Russian model Irina Shayk. Despite Trump's terrifyingly close ties to her mother country, there was Shayk taking in the proceedings. But it wasn't Shayk who Trumpsters took issue with—it was Cooper. Many Twitter users blasted the Hangover star (and Philadelphia native) after discovering that he is, in fact, a Democrat. The deluge of online vitriol made Cooper's name one of the top trending topics on Twitter.
You see, many Republicans were under the impression that Bradley Cooper bled red because of his riveting turn as the late Navy SEAL sniper Chris Kyle in the blockbuster film American Sniper. Kyle, aka “The Devil of Ramadi,” is a conservative icon, and since the film was directed by none other than Clint Eastwood—you know, the fella who stole the show at the last RNC by talking to an empty chair—it stood to reason that Cooper was a Republican, too.
First off, kids: Movies are not real. TV shows aren't, either. Bradley Cooper also played an anti-Semite who ends up in a body brace after trying to suck his own dick on Nip/Tuck, but I'd venture to guess this does not resemble the man IRL. Also, while not the most outspoken actor in the world when it comes to politics, Cooper is a longtime Democrat, having donated some shekels to Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign in 2008, and orchestrated POTUS's Obamacare-promoting appearance on his pal Zach Galifianakis's program Between Two Ferns.
There is, it should be noted, a degree of political bias in Hollywood. Stars on the right like Jon Voight, Clint Eastwood, and Gary Sinise often find themselves the subject of ridicule for their political beliefs, while other high-profile Republicans like Adam Sandler and Vince Vaughn rarely speak out because of it.
But Bradley Cooper—and that beard—is with her.
Russell Street Report Filmstudy Commitment to the Run
Coming off a 20-0 win where the Ravens ran the ball on 42 of 60 (70%) offensive snaps, it's easy (and probably misleading) to cite the team's commitment to the run.
Conditions in this game were optimal for the run. Let's review some of the reasons (0 to 10 significance of the item in parenthesis):
— Vontaze Burfict, one of the best Bengals run defenders missed the game due to a suspension (4).
— The Bengals have long been a team that prefers to rush 4 and drop 7 versus Flacco (3).
— Flacco was returning from his injury for his first action. Whether due to health or inactivity, there was an obvious desire to rely less on him (7).
— The Ravens had some early success running the ball and throwing off play action (3).
— The Ravens had a big lead by halftime and wanted to minimize the chance of costly turnovers (8).
— The Ravens were able to run effectively when they most wanted to, which encouraged them to continue doing so (6).
— Running provided a means to shorten the game with that big lead (10).
The best explanation of this concept and the relativizations I made above is that “Teams run because they win, they don't win because they run.” All of the Ravens run success in the game netted them just 3 points on their long 3rd-quarter drive. They won the game because they built the lead with defense and the TD pass to Jeremy Maclin. They closed it out by grinding out some first downs on the ground and maintaining their defensive dominance.
It's a formula that only works under optimal conditions, so don't be surprised when the Ravens have a game they revert to a low percentage of runs because they are playing from behind.
Judging Flacco's Performance
Joe has played for great defensive teams for much of his career and has been effective adapting to the need for his arm. On Sunday, he dropped back just 18 times, going 9 for 17 for 121 yards, 1 TD and 1 INT. The offensive line provided Flacco an above average opportunity set for his throws, generating Ample Time and Space (ATS) on 10 of 18 pass plays.
I have data for Flacco going back to 2010 during which time Joe has averaged approximately 8.1 net yards per drop back with ATS and 4.1 net without ATS. The idea was to create a simple statistic that would approximate how he performed relative to the opportunity set he was provided.
Here are Joe's results against the Bengals by ATS:
Summarizing relative to expectation:
Here are the Bengals pass rushes by number and ATS result:
The 1 sack and 2 QHs were solid, but unspectacular totals for 18 pass plays.
Some general observations:
–The Bengals used limited variation of pressure, in part because the combination of game situation and down/distance rarely forced the Ravens to pass.
–The one time the Bengals rushed 7, Flacco audibled to hit Maclin on the 48-yard pick play that put the Ravens up 10-0 (Q2, 2:00). That play deserves special mention, because Ben Watson earned his game check on it. Ben crossed near the corner covering Maclin, Darqueze Dennard, but resisted the urge to block or shoulder him, which might have drawn a flag. As he crossed in front of Dennard, the man covering Watson, George Iloka, put his arm out and slowed Dennard to free Maclin. I've never seen a rub/pick play executed any better.
–The Ravens ran a number of draw plays which allowed some space to develop as the Ravens line maintained their blocks.
–The Ravens made use of pulls frequently, both the standard long pulls and 1-gap pulls we've been discussing this preseason.
–Rookie Carl Lawson from Auburn gave the Ravens trouble rushing vs. Ronnie Stanley on the blind side. He was one of the top pass rushers in this draft and looks like the real deal. Those 2 players will meet many times.
–The injury to Danny Woodhead is a serious detriment to the offense. The Ravens will need to find a player who can both pass block and provide some elusiveness as a receiver.
–The average yards per play without ATS is skewed by the only big play, Maclin's TD.
–I can't recall another game, including his 4-for-10 performance in the 2009 Wild Card game at New England, where Joe didn't take any deep shots. His longest pass traveled approximately 17 yards and fell incomplete to Maclin (Q2, 15:00)
–So, summarizing in words…the Ravens produced a solid passing game result without throwing the ball down the field even after considering the above-average conditions Flacco had to operate.
OL Scoring Mechanics
For those of you who are new to my OL grading methods, let's hit a few points.
I mentioned Ample Time and Space (ATS) above. Boiled down to its simplest form, the QB is assumed to have ATS if he has 3 full seconds and enough room to step into his throw in a 120-degree arc centered on the intended receiver.
Pro Football Focus differs in their method of scoring pass rush events and will charge multiple pressures/QHs/sacks on the same play, but always 1 or 0 to any given player. I divide out each event to those I think are responsible. Both systems have their merits. I guess I should simply say that if you don't like fractions, you probably won't like my work.
This year I have made a slight adjustment to the grading standard at center and guard, where it seemed the grading may have been slightly too harsh. That's a remnant of the fact the grading systems were developed with 3 outstanding interior linemen Marshal Yanda, Ben Grubbs, and Matt Birk, playing on the inside. In terms of adjusted points per play, here is the new scale:
The new passing level is .04 lower at center and .03 lower at guard (grading for tackles is unaffected). Over the course of a typical game, that might equate to 1 pressure or 3 missed blocks (at center).
I like to deal with whole grades, so I only give a + or a – if the lineman is in the top or bottom point within a grade level.
I provide the quarter and time references here so you can review the events on NFL Game Pass, a service I highly recommend. If you are a PSL owner, you get it for free. If not, you can purchase the top package, including all games back to 2011 and coaches film for approximately $100 per season.
Offensive Line Scoring
The Ravens ran 60 scored snaps versus the Bengals (excludes accepted penalties which result in no play).
Stanley: Ronnie had a solid effort that was a notch below the Pro Bowl expectations of Ravens fans. Lawson bulled him for a pressure (Q1, 6:16). Lawson drove him across the pocket for the initial flush which resulted in the sack by Atkins (Q2, 8:07; I gave Stanley half the charge for the sack). Finally, Lawson pushed by Stanley's left shoulder for pressure on Flacco's interception (Q3, 14:12). To offset a mediocre pass blocking performance, Stanley blocked well on run plays. He had 6 blocks in level 2, pulled successfully on his only assignment, and had 2 highlights, the best of which was an 8-yard push of Lawson in support of West's 10-yard run left (Q2, 5:03).
Scoring: 60 plays, 53 blocks, 4 missed, 2 pressures, 1/2 sack, 1 false start, 43 points (.72 per play). With adjustment for quality of competition and highlights, that's a C+. He had an extraordinary trend line after returning from injury last season. Let's hope he does just that again.
Hurst: James delivered a solid overall effort with some underlying scoring components that varied greatly. He was beaten by Atkins for a sack (half charge) when Flacco was initially moved off his spot by Stanley blocking Lawson across the pocket (Q2, 8:07). James was also beaten by Billings for a dangerous-looking penetration that hit the pulling Yanda (Q4, 4:33). Hurst was asked to pull 10 times and converted just 6 of those including a shared penetration (Q4, 14:22) when he missed his cut block of Rey as Allen was taken down for a loss of 3. He had 6 blocks in level 2, delivered 2 pancakes (both on pulls), and had 4 total highlight blocks. The best of those was a cut of Rey in space that enabled West to reach the edge (Q1, 1:34).
Scoring: 60 plays, 52 blocks, 4 missed, 2 (1 + 2 x ½) penetrations, ½ sack, 1 false start, 42 points (.70 per play). That's a C with adjustment for highlights and opponent at guard. Were he to deliver a performance like this at guard in each of the 16 games, Ravens fans should be thrilled.
Jensen: Ryan's holding penalties doomed his score in this game, but there were some things to like about his performance. First, the flags:
–(Q1, 7:59) Jensen pancaked Vigil who penetrated through the left B gap. It didn't look like much in terms of a hold and West had already beaten Vigil to the edge when it was called.
–(Q2, 0:19) Jensen was out front nicely and his pancake of Rey (assisted by a handful of jersey) sprung Allen for a 14-yard screen gain. Good call and the play may have cost Tucker a chance at the NFL FG distance record.
–(Q4, 4:26) Ryan rag-dolled NT Sims to the ground as Allen ran off LG. One of the worst things a lineman can do is take a hold while his man sacks the QB. This was an obvious hold, but Jensen again got his money's worth by flattening his opponent. The other good thing about these holds is that none came as a result of getting beat by a pass rusher. These were all judgment issues we have to hope are correctable.
Other than the holds (which is a little like saying “other than this gaping chest wound”), Ryan played well, including 6 blocks in level 2, 2 pancakes, and 2 highlights. He connected on 1 of 2 pulls. Most importantly, he didn't surrender ground that imperiled any of the many pulling linemen behind him. He accumulated 7 missed blocks, primarily due to an inability to find blocks in level 2 (5 instances, including 2 slips).
Scoring: 60 plays, 51 blocks, 7 missed, ½ pressure, 1/3 QH, 3 offensive holding, 31 points (.52 per play). That's an F at center. Without the holding penalties, he'd have graded out a B with adjustment. That's not an excuse for the holds, but a measure of the value of correction.
Yanda: Marshal showed no sign of decline or impact from the shoulder injury which limited him to a handful of preseason snaps. His only negative event was a partial QH (2/3 to him, 1/3 to Jensen) when Atkins beat him inside (Q2, 8:53). He had 5 blocks in level 2, delivered 3 pancakes, pulled successfully on 7 of 8 attempts, and had 2 highlights.
Scoring: 60 plays, 56 blocks, 3 missed, 2/3 QH, 54 points (.90 per play). With adjustment, that's an A. Another day at the office.
Howard: Austin continues to look slow, but it's difficult to argue with the aggregate result. When avoiding fouls and minimizing pass rush events, he reminds me of Willie Anderson in his lone year as a Raven (2008). Howard was beaten outside by Dunlap for a hard QH (Q3, 1:12) on which the Bengals DE seemed to walk around Austin. He otherwise allowed just a single shared pressure as a pass blocker. Howard led the team in level 2 blocks with 8 despite a poor conversion ratio (8/13). It's not a matter of effort, but he's simply too slow to impact the back side of run plays and did not attempt a cut block, a common resort for tackles behind the play.
Scoring: 60 plays, 51 blocks, 6 missed, ½ penetration, ½ pressure, 1 QH, 46 points (.77 per play). That's a solid B with adjustment, primarily for facing Dunlap. I'm happy with the result, but unconvinced Howard can duplicate the grade against a better speed rusher.
If you're interested in seeing scoring trends for the players this season, these charts will be updated weekly.
Whose fast start (Ricky Ray, DeVier Posey) is a precursor of things to come? Whose salary (Emmanuel Arceneaux, Ernest Jackson) will finally translate into production? Three weeks into the season, Fantasy owners are beginning to see which players can be considered reliable performers along with patiently waiting for those who have yet to live up to expectations. While the sample sizes are miniscule the numbers are enough to have a clear idea who's worth starting and who should remain benched going into Week 4.
Toronto at Winnipeg
Thursday | 8:30 p.m. ET
Start: Ray ($10,729) is in a groove and is reasonably priced (fourth-highest salary at QB). He's also facing a Blue Bombers secondary that has allowed 354.5 passing yards per game, eighth in the league. Toronto is throwing the ball more than 80 percent of the time, and with three of the top seven players in receiving yards (S.J. Green, Posey, Armanti Edwards) donning Argonauts jerseys, expect Ray to continue firing the ball downfield. No pivot has delivered the big play like Ray has thus far, as he leads the league with nine completions of more than 30 yards and averages 9.4 yards per pass play. Regardless of score, the Argos are going to put pressure on the Bombers even though the Winnipeg defence tops the pack with four interceptions.
Sit: Whoever starts in the Argonauts' backfield — Brandon Whitaker ($5,952) or James Wilder ($3,000) — will face a stubborn run defence. The Blue Bombers have allowed just three yards per carry and are one of two teams (Calgary) that have yet to give up a run of more than 20 yards. Whitaker was injured near the end of Saturday's victory at Ottawa, which could open the door for Wilder to make his second start of the season. Either way, your Fantasy team would be best served not to place either on your Week 4 roster.
Calgary at Montreal
Friday | 7:00p.m. ET
Start: If you have to start an Alouettes player, make sure it's Tyrell Sutton ($6,407), the one constant in the league's eighth-ranked offence. Sutton leads the league in rushing with 210 yards and should be able to deliver a productive evening against a Stampeders run defence that is eighth in yards allowed per game (81.7) while giving up 4.8 yards per tote. Averaging 6.2 yards per carry, Sutton will be expected to chew up both yards and time as the Montreal offence knows it cannot afford to be involved in a track meet against a Calgary attack with the potential to bust open a contest with its quick-strike capabilities.
Sit: Bo Levi Mitchell. It sounds strange to suggest sitting him, yet the Montreal defence has put up numbers to strongly suggest avoiding Mitchell and his $11,723 salary. In his last three games against the Als, Mitchell has averaged just 276 passing yards and only three passing majors. Two of those scores came in one game (Week 6 of the 2015 season), and he faces a Montreal secondary that has flustered Mike Reilly and Jonathon Jennings in their last two games. The Alouettes are second in the fewest yards allowed per play (5.6) and have given up just two pass plays of 30-plus yards, numbers that suggest that this week is not the one to have Mitchell in your lineup.
Ottawa at Edmonton
Friday | 10:00 p.m. ET
Start: REDBLACKS receiver/return specialist Diontae Spencer ($5,980) leads the league with 601 all-purpose yards and averages 17.1 yards each time the ball is in his hands. In a game in which East Coast watchers could be up well into Saturday morning, Spencer is going to have a decisive part in whether the defending champs finally get into the win column or fall short in another wild Friday night affair. If this game does indeed become a shootout, the return yards Spencer could amass makes him a must-start performer. Edmonton does a good job defending returns, yet will be challenged to contain the explosive skills of Spencer, who is also 10-for-11 in passes targeted in his direction.
Sit: Eskimos rookie receiver D'hquille Williams ($4000) could still emerge as a Fantasy standout later in the season, but he's a clear fourth in the Edmonton pecking order behind Adarius Bowman, Brandon Zylstra and Vidal Hazelton. Bowman is overdue for a breakout performance and might get it against an Ottawa defence that is seventh in passing yards allowed per game and has given up seven passes of more than 30 yards. Williams showed his deep ball prowess in the Week 1 win over BC, but considering he's been targeted just eight times thus far, rolling the dice on his bargain value might be too risky.
BC at Hamilton
Saturday | 7:30 p.m. ET
Start: Now is the time to play the slumping Jennings ($11,625), who could have a healthy evening of numbers at the expense of a Ticats defence giving up a staggering 10.4 yards per pass play. Jennings should be able to see his 7.9 yards per pass total take a hike down the lofty path he was on for much of the second half of the 2016 season, and with Hamilton having to contend with both the Lions' receiving corps and the presence of running back Jeremiah Johnson, don't be surprised if Jennings finds ample running lanes to further add to the stress of a troubled Tiger-Cats unit.
Sit: It was assumed Hamilton receiver Luke Tasker ($5,958) would benefit from an abundance of targets in the wake of losing Terrence Toliver, yet the vision failed to materialize last Saturday as Tasker was not targeted once in the loss to Saskatchewan. Surely, Zach Collaros will rectify the error, but the Tiger-Cats have one offencive major in their first eight quarters while their 208 total yards per game is 103.7 yards fewer than eighth-place Montreal. Brian Tyms leads the team with 16 targets and the emergence of Jalen Saunders last week only adds to the uncertainty of who gets the most attention from Collaros.
Lawrence Timmons' contract must be addressed after the season, and the veteran Steelers linebacker hopes that means an extension.
Timmons will be heading into the final year of his contract after this season, which typically is when the Steelers like to extend their top players.
Timmons, who will be 30 next year, will count $15.1 million against the salary cap. Only quarterback Ben Roethlisberger's cap number is higher for 2016.
Timmons wants to finish his career with the Steelers.
“I hope so, I love it here,” Timmons said. “I can't see myself being anywhere else.”
That might be one of the reasons Timmons is being a good soldier while playing a new role in the defense. Timmons is being asked to cover more, which is driving his statistics down.
Timmons had 139 tackles last season, but is on pace for 116 this year. He has more sacks (2.5 to 2) than 2014, but he also has struggled in coverage at times, especially when matched up against a wide receiver.
“He covers a lot more this year,” defensive end Cam Heyward said. “We are not bringing him on as many blitzes, but that's the nature of the game. You have to do some things you don't like. We have to make sure he continues to play at a high level for us.”
Playing in coverage more under defensive coordinator Keith Butler is something Timmons is OK with.
““I am a guy who is willing to do whatever,” Timmons said. “They still rush me, too, so I am not complaining. The more you can do, like Tomlin said, will keep you around here longer. I am trying to be around here for a while.”
Wheaton steps up
Wide receiver Markus Wheaton was expected to take his game to a new level in his third year in the league.
It hasn't worked out for Wheaton yet. He has 16 catches for 273 yards and a touchdown through 10 games. He's been targeted only 32 times.
Offensive coordinator Todd Haley said Wheaton is handling the lack of opportunities well.
“It is a tough one,” Haley said. “To me, it will define what he is going to be because everybody can't handle it. You have one of the best in the league that you need to be targeting a bunch and makes a lot of plays. The guys who don't get it for chunks of time have to stay mentally tough, and he's shown (an ability) to do that.”
Wheaton hasn't had more than three catches in a game this season.
Back to Seattle
Butler spent 10 years playing linebacker with the Seahawks (1978-87) and will have back to Seattle for only the second time in nearly 30 years.
“It's going to be special,” Butler said. “I spent 10 years of my life there and it is a great town, rabid fans and they love football there. It is going to be a good chance to get back and see the city again.”
Butler is second on the Seahawks' all-time list for tackles with 813, and started the last time the Steelers beat Seattle on the road in 1983.
Bennett dominating
While the Seahawks' Legion of Boom secondary gets a lot of credit, defensive lineman Michael Bennett might be the one having the best year of them all.
Bennett has 6.5 sacks in 10 games and has been a game-changer at times.
“He kind of finds gaps and is kind of unpredictable,” center Cody Wallace said. “He is probably one of his most disruptive guys up front.”
Injury report
Linebacker Ryan Shazier (knee) and cornerback Brandon Boykin (ankle) sat out of practice on Thursday. Tight end Matt Spaeth (knee) was imited. Shazier practiced fully on Wednesday.

Contrary to popular belief, the Labour Party's support for Zionism did not originate with the Balfour declaration but with the party's own War Aims memorandum which was published in August 1917, three months before Balfour's letter to Lord Rothschild.
It set out a socialist and labour vision for the future once peace had been achieved and included a section on the Jews and Palestine. Their interest in Jewish civil and political rights started earlier, not with the Labour Party, but with the trade union movement. How Labour was persuaded to embrace Zionism is one of the forgotten stories of the first world war.
The memorandum may have been overshadowed by the Balfour Declaration but it has a unique place in history because the Labour Party was the first political party in Britain to declare their backing for the right of the Jewish people to return and live in Palestine. It was achieved not by the efforts of Chaim Weizmann and his fellow Zionists but by the hard work and determination of the Jewish working classes, the Jewish socialist group Poale Zion, and one Jewish trade union leader in particular, Moses Sclare. Weitzman credited Poale Zion for the inclusion of Jewish rights in the memorandum.
Poale Zion was a Marxist–Zionist movement which was founded in Eastern Europe at the turn of the 20th century. The ideology of Poale Zion was a blend of socialism and Zionism aimed at persuading Jewish workers to support Palestine as a Jewish homeland as well to campaigning for Jewish equality in all countries.
Poale Zion was active in Britain from 1905 onwards and throughout the first world war campaigned for the granting of political and civil rights for the Jewish people in Russia and Romania where these common rights were currently being denied to them. Their efforts were rewarded at both the 1915 and 1916 TUC congresses which unanimously adopted resolutions about the civil and political rights of Jews moved by Moses Sclare, the general secretary of the Leeds Amalgamated Jewish Tailors', Machiners' and Pressers' Trade Union. What had made his 1915 resolution unique was that this was the first time anyone, albeit a Jew, had ever spoken at a TUC Congress about the civil and political rights of the Jewish people.
In August 1917, Labour published its War Aims Memorandum, which had been drafted by Arthur Henderson, the leader of the Labour Party, and Sidney Webb.
“The British Labour Movement”, they declared, “expresses the opinion that Palestine should be set free from the harsh and op­pressive government of the Turk, in order that the country may form a free state, under international guarantee, to which such of the Jewish People as desired to do so may return, and may work out their salvation”.
Three months later, on 28 December 1917, a special national conference of over 700 delegates from the trade unions and the Labour Party voted to accept the memorandum. When the Labour and socialist parties of the allied powers discussed their attitude to the war in February 1918 they adopted Labour's memorandum as their main policy document.
There is little evidence available as to why the authors included the section on the Jews and Palestine. Henderson, as secretary of the Labour Party, was known to be sympathetic towards Zionist demands for a Jewish homeland in Palestine as well as being aware of the problems of Jewish Labour and the work of the Poale Zion. It is not known if his co-author Webb held similar views. All we can assume was that since he fully supported the aims of the memorandum he was not opposed to the paragraph's inclusion.
The memorandum is important because not only did it ignite Labour's enthusiasm for Zionism but also because it established Poale Zion as the Jewish voice on Palestine within Britain's' Labour Party, with which it affiliated in 1920. Although Poale Zion built a close relationship with the Labour Party, and counted several Jewish Labour MPs within its membership, it ultimately failed when it mattered when, in 1945, along with others they were unable to change the decision of the Attlee government to ignore prior Labour conference commitments on Palestine.
However their legacy was that they laid the groundwork for the Labour Party's support for Israel from the 1920s onwards. A century after the War Aims memorandum was issued Poale Zion's successor organisation, the Jewish Labour Movement (JLM), is once again speaking out on Jewish concerns within the Labour Party.
The centenary of the Balfour Declaration is on Thursday.

Earlier this week, our Mark Heisler reported that the Orlando Magic would be willing to wait until next summer to trade Dwight Howard if that is what it takes to get fair value for the superstar center.
It's hard to imagine Howard even coming to training camp with the Magic, let alone playing the entire season in Orlando, where he is slightly more popular than George Zimmerman and Casey Anthony.
But what if he did?
The NBA schedule was released Thursday, and more than one-third of Orlando's games – 28 out of 82 – are against teams that have been mentioned as potential trade partners for Howard.
Howard wants to be traded to Brooklyn. But he said in December that he also would accept a trade to Dallas or the Los Angeles Lakers. Then our Chris Sheridan uncovered that he also would consider the Los Angeles Clippers.
The Houston Rockets have made no secret of their desire to acquire Howard. The Cleveland Cavaliers could be part of a reported three-team deal involving Howard. And there are speculative cities such as New York, Chicago and Atlanta.
And the media in all those cities will treat their team's matchup with the Magic as if the Ringling Bros. have come to town.
The Magic don't go more than three weeks without playing one of the nine teams. They have seven sets of back-to-back games against such teams. So until Howard is traded, the story won't go away.
Here's how it might play out:
Nov. 6 at Chicago: Hours before the Magic tip off against the Bulls, Skip Bayless screams that Howard would be a bad fit in Chicago because “the Windy City already has something really tall that just stands there – the Sears Tower.”
Nov. 9 vs. Brooklyn: The Magic issue 110 credentials to New York area news outlets sent to Florida to cover the game. When they all crowd into the locker room to talk to Howard, he tells them one of the reasons he wants to leave is because the Magic need a new, bigger arena.
Nov. 11 at Brooklyn: On his first trip to the NBA's newest arena, Howard is clandestinely wined and dined by Nets owner Mikhail Prokhorov, who plies him with a bag of diamonds from one of is mines, serves him vodka in Brighton Beach and promises him a mail-order bride from his native Russia.
Nov. 13 vs. New York: Spike Lee, already in Orlando planning a movie about Trayvon Martin, appears in a courtside seat wearing a Knicks jersey with Howard's name and familiar No. 12. Howard exchanges a bro hug with Lee, then manages four points and five rebounds as he is shut down by Tyson Chandler.
Nov. 19 at Atlanta: Howard's homecoming is televised by NBA TV, which fills its studio with all of its analysts to dissect the drama. Brent Barry offers a variety of opinions on Howard's future, and Steve Smith, Dennis Scott, Kendall Gill, Rick Fox, Greg Anthony and Brevin Knight all repeatedly say nothing more than “I agree” after each one.
Nov. 23 vs. Cleveland: Howard fouls out in 18 minutes of a home loss to the Cavaliers as Anderson Varejao draws six charging fouls by flopping, immediately becoming a favorite of Magic fans.
Nov. 30 vs. Brooklyn: After playing the Nets for the third time in three weeks, Magic GM Rob Hennigan accuses David Stern of fixing the schedule to give Nets players multiple opportunities before the trading deadline to recruit Howard to Brooklyn.
Dec. 2 at LA Lakers: Mitch Kupchak's chances of landing Howard take a huge blow when T.J. Simers of the Los Angeles Times calls Howard a “diva” and a “prima donna” in his Sunday column after Howard blows off his interview request at Saturday's practice.
Dec. 12 vs. Atlanta: In an attempt to deflect the unrelenting media glare off his old AAU buddy, Hawks forward Josh Smith tells GM Danny Ferry he is not signing a contract extension and will become a free agent.
Jan. 2 vs. Chicago: Still working his way back from a torn ACL, Bulls guard Derrick Rose travels with the team and is seen talking privately with Howard in an arena corridor. When asked if Rose was recruiting Howard, Bulls coach Tom Thibodeau tersely snaps, “No. We have enough to win.”
Jan. 5 vs. New York: The Big Apple media contingent traveling to cover the game is so big that they get together to charter their own plane and book every room in the Orlando Marriott.
Jan. 12 at LA Clippers: The night before the game, Howard has dinner with Chris Paul and asks his advice on how to demand a trade without being labeled as a selfish jerk.
Jan. 20 vs. Dallas: After Mavericks owner Mark Cuban tells the Orlando Sentinel that his team's plan is to clear enough salary cap room to sign both Howard and Chris Paul in the summer, he is fined $5 million for tampering by Stern.
Jan. 28 at Brooklyn: Howard buys the Brooklyn Bridge from a vendor on Fulton Street for the bargain price of just $10,000.
Jan. 30 at New York: Staying in the same hotel for three straight days to play a pair of road games five miles apart, Howard complains about the rigors of NBA travel.
Feb. 6 vs. LA Clippers: Blake Griffin posterizes Howard with one of his patented flying dunk/cross-eyed stare combinations that immediately goes viral on YouTube. After the game, Paul correctly notes that would have never happened if Howard had joined the Clippers.
Feb. 8 at Cleveland: With the trade deadline approaching, Cavaliers owner Dan Gilbert tells the media nothing is imminent regarding a reported three-way deal with the Magic and Lakers that would land Andrew Bynum in Cleveland. He also says Howard is much less of a villain than LeBron James.
Feb. 13 vs. Atlanta: With rumors running rampant, Howard misses his team's final game before All-Star Weekend with a recurrence of his back injury and withdraws from the midseason showcase. Agent Dan Fegan claims the timing of the injury two days before Howard was to face 1,500 media members in Houston was just a coincidence.
Feb. 20 at Dallas: On the eve of the trading deadline, Howard goes to Hennigan and tells him that he has changed his mind and would like to opt into the final year of his contract. Hennigan politely reminds Howard that he is in the final year of his contract.
Feb. 23 vs. Cleveland: Two days after the trading deadline, the Plain Dealer reports that a proposed three-team trade that would have landed Howard with the Lakers and Andrew Bynum with the Cavaliers did not happen because Gilbert was advised by a high-ranking NBA official to not make the deal. Fegan accuses Stern of meddling. “A high-ranking NBA official,” Fegan said. “Oh, OK, who might that be?”
March 1 vs. Houston: Rockets GM Daryl Morey relentlessly pushes on in his plan to acquire Howard by buying out guard Kevin Martin. In a news release, Morey thanks Martin for his professionalism. Martin goes from last place to first place by signing with the Spurs.
March 12 vs. LA Lakers: An Orlando Sentinel reporter asks Kobe Bryant if last year he really told Howard that he would be the third option on the Lakers behind himself and Pau Gasol. “No, that's not true,” Bryant said. “And now he'd be the fourth option, behind me, Pau and Steve.”
March 20 at New York: Howard buys the Manhattan Bridge from a vendor on Canal Street for the bargain price of just $10,000.
March 30 at Atlanta: In an attempt to acquire as many of Howard's cronies as possible, Ferry signs Gilbert Arenas to a 10-day contract. The plan backfires when Arenas shoot 6-of-26 and playfully pulls a gun on Howard during a postgame handshake.
April 1 at Houston: The Rockets drop to 12-62 with a 113-52 loss to the Magic in which Howard goes for 61 points and 33 rebounds. Omer Asik fouls out in 14 minutes with two points and three rebounds. Jeremy Lin sets an NBA record with 15 turnovers.
April 5 at Chicago: Howard tells a large contingent of Bulls reporters that he truly has no interest in joining the Bulls. When asked why, Howard says, “They have enough to win.”
April 7 at Cleveland: With his team unable to land Bynum and floundering in last place in the Central Division, Gilbert composes another email manifesto in which he steadfastly promises Cavs fans that his team will win two championships before LeBron James does.
April 15 vs. Chicago: Before Howard's last home game with the Magic, he thanks the fans for their “support and patience through a very difficult time in my life.” Fans at Amway Arena show their appreciation by showering Howard with boos, profanities and garbage until the referees call a forfeit.

After days of protests over an anti-Islam film, American diplomatic missions in the Middle East and North Africa were braced for further violence after Friday prayers. The US put its overseas missions on high alert.
Germany has closed its embassies in a number of Muslim-majority countries in fear of attacks. "We are observing how the security situation develops with great attentiveness and we have increased security precautions at a number of foreign missions," a spokesman for the German Foreign Office told SPIEGEL ONLINE. Embassies in North Africa, Afghanistan and Pakistan are believed to be among those affected.
The spokesman said that the missions would only close on Friday, though. Other German institutions such as aid organizations have also been urged to increase security precautions, he said.
German Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle said he was "deeply concerned" about the attacks on US embassies. He called on the countries in question to protect foreign missions. "Diplomats have to be able to do their work without fear," he said.
Westerwelle said he could understand the outrage that many Muslims felt about the anti-Islam film. "But this outrage cannot justify violence."
The German army in Afghanistan is also increasing its security precautions. "We are assuming that we will also feel the effects of this whole business," one German soldier told SPIEGEL ONLINE in a telephone interview. "When the people here see the film, they are sure to protest."
Violent Clashes
The US ambassador to Libya and three other Americans were killed on Tuesday when protesters attacked the US consulate in Benghazi. American officials are investigating the possibility that militant Islamist groups such as al-Qaida may have exploited the Benghazi protests to attack the consulate.
There have been violent protests in Cairo and Yemen since then. On Friday, Egyptian police clashed with protesters after security forces blocked the route to the US Embassy.
The protests were sparked by an anti-Islamic film posted online that features an unflattering depiction of the Prophet Muhammad. US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton denounced the video on Thursday. "The United States government had absolutely nothing to do with this video," she said. "We absolutely reject its content and message."
The video and the associated protests have also become an issue in the US election campaign. Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney used the protests and what he called an apology by the US government as an opportunity to attack Obama.
At a campaign event on Thursday, Obama took a hard line on the attacks. "To all those who would do us harm: No act of terror will go unpunished," he said. "No act of violence shakes the resolve of the United States of America."
Meanwhile, Pope Benedict XVI began a three-day visit to Lebanon on Friday. His visit is the focus of much international attention, given the heightened tensions in the region.
On Friday, German commentators analyze the violence and its implications for US foreign policy.
The center-right Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung writes:
"The murder of an ambassador in Libya and the attacks on US diplomatic missions in other Arab countries is sure to strengthen the skepticism that more than a few Americans feel toward Muslims and the political changes brought by the Arab revolutions. The deeply held American belief that all you have to do is liberate people from serfdom and dictatorship, and then democracy and a market economy will develop more or less on their own, burned to ash in the trial by fire of Iraq. A fact that academics and historically informed diplomats have always known can now be observed throughout the Arab world: Deeply ingrained cultural attitudes do not change simply because one political regime replaces another. In the long process of building a democratic society, it is not possible to simply skip stages."
The left-leaning Berliner Zeitung writes:
"The attacks on US embassies and consulates in the Arab world can not be justified in any way. If it turns out that al-Qaida is behind the attacks, as some US officials suspect, then they are acts of terrorism committed under the guise of religion. If they turn out to be uncoordinated actions by angry believers, then they are an expression of a frightening ignorance. A crazy individual US citizen has uploaded a movie onto the Internet which denigrates the Prophet Muhammad. The US government can not be held responsible for that. But that clearly does not help US President Barack Obama very much. He has to bear the political consequences of the recent events by himself."
"Four years ago, Obama pledged to seek reconciliation with the Muslim world. Now, it is doubtful whether he has succeeded. The US and its European allies now have to ask themselves how much support they still enjoy in the countries of the Arab Spring."
The center-left daily Süddeutsche Zeitung writes:
"Since the Arab Spring broke out, there have been many difficult moments in the relationships between America and the Arab nations. But few have been as delicate as this one. America hardly has influence in the region any longer, and now sees itself confronted with anti-American sentiment in places where it no longer controls the dictators. Meanwhile, forces that simultaneously exploit and spurn America are gaining influence."
"Middle Eastern policy is a thankless task for America. But for precisely this reason -- and despite the election campaign -- it would be unwise to pour oil into the fire. The fact that President Obama has deployed destroyers and marines to Libya, and may soon send out drones, isn't a good sign, though. Should Washington fall into defense mode, as it has in Yemen against al-Qaida, where the anti-terrorism fight is the top priority and there have been civilian victims, then the tables could turn quickly. People in the Arab world want to be more than just a security risk."
The conservative Die Welt writes:
"US President Barack Obama's Middle East policy is in ruins. Like no president before him, he tried to win over the Arab world. After some initial hesitation, he came out clearly on the side of the democratic revolutions. In this context, he must accept the fact that he has snubbed old close allies such as Israel, Saudi Arabia and the Egyptian military. And now parts of the freed societies are turning against the country which helped bring them into being. Anti-Americanism in the Arab world has even increased to levels greater than in the Bush era. It's a bitter outcome for Obama."
"Obama was naive to believe that one only needed to adopt a new tone and show more respect in order to dispel deep-seated reservations about the free world. In practice, the policies of the Obama administration in the region were not as naive as they may have seemed at times, and the Americans have always been much more involved in the Middle East than the passive Europeans. But Washington has provided the image of a distracted superpower in the process of decline to the societies there. This image of weakness is being exploited by Salafists and al-Qaida, who are active in North Africa from Somalia to Mali."
"One thing is clear: If jihadists believe they can attack American installations and kill an ambassador on the anniversary of Sept. 11, then America's deterrent power has declined considerably. For a superpower, it is not enough just to want to be loved. You have to scare the bad guys to keep them in check."
The left-leaning Die Tageszeitung writes:
"The conservative US media have already -- excessively -- labeled the anti-US protests in Egypt, Libya and Yemen as a 'wildfire' and interpreted them as a result of Obama's 'weakness.'"
"It's lucky for Obama that his opponent Romney is acting in such a hapless manner. Instead of condemning the attacks in a statesman-like fashion and assuring the president of his support, Romney criticized the government's alleged 'apology' to the demonstrators. That was not just nonsense, but partisan maneuvering at a moment when patriotism would have been appropriate. With his attack, Romney has scored an own goal."
The financial daily Handelsblatt writes:
"Three years after Obama's speech in Cairo, which was supposed to initiate a new beginning in the Middle East, the United States now has even less support in the region than before. That's not a failure of this president. Instead, it is the consequences of an American foreign policy that for decades favored power over democracy, and a hard line over human rights -- and which will suffer from a credibility problem for a long time for precisely those reasons."
"Mitt Romney has, however, failed to recognize the very core of the American dilemma. He attacked Obama with twisted facts shortly after the announcement of the death of the US ambassador to Libya, Chris Stevens. He claimed that the US government had sympathized with the attackers in Benghazi. But not only was that factually wrong, it also demonstrated an alarmingly high level of foreign policy incompetence to his own party. None of this would matter, except that Romney wants Obama's job -- and might even get it on Nov. 6."
The mass-circulation daily Bild writes:
"Naked hatred is raging against a country that many people in the world regard as a symbol of freedom. When US flags burn, embassies are vandalized, and diplomats are murdered, it is an attack on the West, and not just America!"
"We rooted for the demonstrators at Tahrir Square, and many of us have longed to see democracy in the Arab nations. But democracy includes honoring the lives of fellow humans."
"The turmoil in Libya, Cairo, and Bangladesh is a return to the Middle Ages, when people were beheaded and stoned to death. No pathetic anti-Islam film can justify hate-filled murder."
"The West must be tough on terrorism. And it must show that it can differentiate between rabble-rousers and peaceful Muslims."

Parramatta Eels Chairman Max Donnelly announced today the appointment of Bernie Gurr as the new Parramatta Eels CEO on a 3 year contact.
Gurr was selected from an outstanding field of applicants following a thorough recruitment process undertaken over the past six weeks.
After graduating from the University of New South Wales with a business degree, Gurr had a successful career with Ernst and Young before being appointed Director of Finance for FIFA World Cup USA in 1994.
He then returned to Australia and became CEO of the Sydney Roosters, the Club he had played for during 6 seasons from 1978 through 1983.
During his 9 seasons as Roosters CEO, Gurr oversaw a turnaround of the Club on and off the field, presiding over eight straight playoff appearances, three grand finals and the 2002 NRL Premiership.
He returned to the US in 2003 and has most recently been a senior executive with the Crown Worldwide Group for the past nine years.
Eels Chairman Max Donnelly said that Bernie's appointment is a major and positive step forward for the Club.
“Following my appointment in July, I made it clear we needed a strong and experienced CEO to accelerate the rebuilding of the Football Club.
“Bernie emerged as the best choice because of his proven financial and leadership experience both in business and in sports administration.
“He also displayed throughout the process a passion and strategic vision to transform our Club and take it forward in a positive way.
“Together with his professional values, Bernie will bring enormous credibility with our stakeholders and I am sure he will develop a strong relationship with our members and supporters," Mr Donnelly said.
Mr Gurr said he was looking forward to leading the Club towards a positive future.
"It is a privilege to be appointed Chief Executive Officer of the Parramatta National Rugby League Club.
“The Parramatta Eels are poised for an outstanding future, with a large and passionate supporter base, a great junior league, financial sustainability and, from 2019, the absolute best Club stadium in Australia located in the geographic heart of Sydney.
"Observing from the outside, the Parramatta Football Program is headed in the right direction.
“The resilience and competitiveness demonstrated throughout an extremely demanding 2016 season is a tribute to Head Coach, Brad Arthur, and his players,” Mr Gurr said.
Gurr will begin his time with the Club in late October.

Ash (grey- I wandered the lumberyard and picked the grey-est board I could find)
1/4" MDF sheet, somewhat larger than the ultimately desired shape
Materials:For this table, I used three different woods. You can use whatever you want, but you need two with significantly different colors, and a third that is in-between. In my case, I went with white-black-grey. To get this, I used:I exclusively used 4/4 lumber (that's actually around 2 cm thick, for you non-americans), although some thicker wood would have been nice for the legs- I just laminated two pieces for those.Tools:I made every cut on my table saw, using a fence and a cross-cut sled (I won't go into all the details of how to make one-it's fairly self explanatory, and you can always look elsewhere for details). You can probably use a chop/miter saw instead of a cross-cut sled, but you'll still need a tablesaw to rip your boards into the right width. Given all the cuts you'll be making, I strongly advise you avoid hand-tools here.You'll want a modest pile of woodworking clamps, as well as a pair of nice straight-edges to clamp across the whole row. A nice straight board will do well- I'd recommend giving it a layer of furniture wax to keep it from getting accidentally glued to the workpiece. you can always remove it later if you want to use the board in something.If you don't have access to the power tools, you might be able to get someone to do the cuts for you; I think many woodworking stores (like the one I go to) have shops for doing custom jobs. If you're just getting started in woodworking, have no fear; this project is about as simple as things come- it's just lots of repetition. There's no fancy cuts anywhere.
When I was much younger, and my interest in chemistry was just beginning to influence my thoughts of post-secondary school and (a lifetime away) a career, there were hints of my destiny that came in the form of somewhat perverse interests.
One of these was my profound interest in the chemical constituents of coffee. A non-chemist simply sees a cup of coffee for what their nervous system and digestive see it: a black liquid that tastes bitter, inhibits your appetite, and gives you about a two hour energy boost. However, being the child of two coffee snobs who also happened to be career scientists, I had different notions.
What makes a good cup of coffee? People have their preferred brands, countries of origin, or even vintages, if you have that much money to throw away. There are even those who eat an obscenely expensive bean that has been digested and excreted by the Asian palm civet. But can you actually taste the difference? And more importantly, what makes up the difference in flavour?
Most coffees are simply described in terms of acidity, roast, and some vague notes about other flavours (vanilla, caramel, berries, chocolate). This, to me, was completely unsatisfactory. Little did I know that coffee flavour chemistry is a legitimate field of study, as is the study of flavours and scents in general.
In my slightly-more-recent searches on the topic, I stumbled across a book entitled Coffee Flavour Chemistry; a better match for my childhood fascination could not have been conceived. Though now somewhat out of date, the book represented a major achievement in the field in 2002 when it was written by Ivon Flament, and contains some very interesting information and a comprehensive review of the work done in identifying coffee's chemical components. It identifies over one thousand compounds present in both green and roasted coffee beans, describing their aromas and their significance in the overall flavour of the coffee. Intuitively, the most important constituents of coffee flavour are the ones with the highest “signal-to-concentration” ratio, or how easily they can be detected at a certain concentration. Some of the most important constituents can be seen below, with their described flavours:
The majority of these compounds are of course formed via the well-known Strecker degradation and the Maillard reaction. These, as well as other important aspects of the roasting of coffee beans, are discussed within the book.
Perhaps what I found most interesting are the techniques used to determine what are called “odour activity values”, which essentially amount to a quantification of how strong a compound's odour is at a given concentration.
The methods used for finding these values are actually gas-chromatographic olfactometry, which is exactly what you think it is: they run a GC, and have someone sniffing the end of the column, who presses a button each time they smell a compound. I laughed at this when I read it, not because it's unreliable (quite the contrary), but because imagining running a column with a panel of “sniffers” at the end instead of a mass spectrometer is quite an image indeed.
The original method (GC-olfactometry) was purely qualitative in terms of odours, but later methods known as CHARM (a proprietary technique involving dilution-to-threshold) and AEDA (aroma extract dilution analysis, a similar method) have overshadowed it in recent years. Yet another method, named with a classic, groan-inducing acronym is “GC-SNIF”, which stands for “gas chromatography-surface of nasal impact frequency”, in which panels of test subjects are used to determine how “smellable” a compound is at a single concentration, producing averaged and normalized curves for the detection of smells.
Apart from being a funny image, these methods of analysis (which are almost always used in conjunction with purely analytical methods) illustrate an interesting point about flavour chemistry. While GC or LC data, as well as mathematical methods such as canonical analysis or principal component analysis are useful for predicting simple properties, the use of human organoleptic testing is essential to actually understanding the results.
Another salient point that was mentioned was the perception of quality. In a 1986 paper, Liardon and Spadone discovered that while the degree of coffee roasting was correlated to a large number of compounds and their concentrations, the quality of the coffee did not appear to be correlated to any of them. One of the few quantitative differences that could be established based on quality was that between green C. arabica and C. robusta beans. Robusta tended to have higher concentrations of methanol, acetone, pyridine, methylpyrazine, and furfural, and also seemed to be unique in that they contained methyl formate, t-butyl alcohol, and furfuryl alcohol, not found in Arabica strains. Robusta beans are widely perceived to be inferior in flavour and aroma to arabica beans, which is why many coffee packages will declare themselves to contain “100% arabica beans” to avoid confusion and distinguish themselves.
So what does this tell us? After skimming through the book I came away with two lessons: the first is that while computers and statistical analyses become more and more powerful every day, it seems there is usually a place for subjective human-generated data. Without olfactory analyses from panelists, much of the work on coffee and its constituents would have been completely useless. The second is that while this data is essential to understanding the importance of certain compounds in generating a specific flavour, it is almost worthless when trying to establish a causal link between specific compounds and the perceived quality of the coffee (edit: this is not strictly true for identifying fundamental flaws in the bean due to parasites, mould, or poor growing conditions, which can all be identified by screening for certain compounds). For the most part, as everyone has heard so many times in their life: there's just no explaining some people's tastes.
However, I think for most of us in grad school, the fact remains that the most important compound in coffee is one which contributes almost nothing to its odour profile:
The Federal Reserve finally has wiped its hands clean of AIG and turned a nearly $18 billion profit for taxpayers in the process.
Now it's up to the Treasury Department to sell the rest of the U.S. government's stake in the insurance giant.
The Federal Reserve Bank of New York announced Thursday that it had sold the last of its securities related to the AIG (AIG) bailout. The portfolio, known as Maiden Lane III, consisted of collateralized debt obligations, or CDOs -- highly complex financial instruments that bundle various kinds of debt. The Maiden Lane III sales earned $6.6 billion.
Months earlier, the New York Fed sold off Maiden Lane II assets for $2.8 billion. That portfolio contained mortgage-backed securities insured by AIG. The NY Fed also made $8.2 billion in interest and fees from a credit line extended to AIG that was terminated last year.
AIG's bad bets crippled the insurer in 2008. The company played a major role in the financial crisis that ensued. In an unprecedented move, the government swooped in, buying many of the toxic assets.
Related: Treasury to sell more AIG shares
"The completion of the sale of the Maiden Lane III portfolio marks the end of an important chapter -- our assistance to AIG -- that was undertaken to stabilize the financial system in the midst of the financial crisis," William Dudley, president of the New York Fed, said in a press release.
That said, the U.S. government is not entirely free of AIG. The Treasury Department still owns $29 billion, or roughly 53% of AIG's common stock.
The Treasury Department has said it too expects to make a profit on that investment, as it sells the shares over time.
Feminist activists stormed the red carpet at the Suffragette premiere. What's the fact behind this protest?
The new Gender Equality Duty, created under The Equality Act 2006, requires that ‘ public bodies must promote and take action to bring about gender equality, which involves: looking at issues for men and women' . We, women against feminism UK, don't like the work equality because equality may not be synonyms with justice and a good lifestyle. JUSTICE should be the right word in this case.
But, let's continue……
Feminists were protesting because their funding was cut because the women's charities (Read feminists) were told that they must start providing services to male victims of DV under equality laws (The Equality Act 2006) or have their funding cut. The feminists refused , and their funding was cut. All the feminists had to do was provide services equally to men, which they shouldn't have had a problem with, considering they are “all about equality” and all, but they refused.
That's the feminist equality: MEN are OUT. Women against the feminst agenda are OUT.
If you understand feminism and you have studied about feminism you know they'll probably close the charity rather than help men and boys.
That's the feminist agenda. Short and simple.
That's the true feminist “equality”. That's the feminist “justice”. That's the feminism “for everyone” lie.

Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, a Republican presidential candidate, speaks to the media during a campaign event at a diner in Amherst, N.H., on July 16. (Dominick Reuter/Reuters)
It seemed clear this week why Republican presidential hopeful Scott Walker isn't planning to spend much time here in New Hampshire.
During an hour-long stop at a pizza parlor on Monday, voters grilled him on immigration and how he would combat the Islamic State. Liberal activists tricked him into posing with a fake check from billionaire donors. And outside, a protester jumped on top of a car and shouted, “You're afraid to answer the real questions!”
Like many other GOP candidates, Walker is spending relatively little time campaigning in this state, which holds the nation's first primary, banking instead on winning the Iowa caucuses and then stockpiling delegates in the South and elsewhere.
“For us, we're running a nationwide campaign; we're not just running an early-state campaign,” Walker said at a cheese
steak shop in Philadelphia last week. “With the quality of the field . . . it may go as far as even being close to the convention before we know who the ultimate nominee is.”
Walker's approach is a part of a broader trend that threatens to make New Hampshire less crucial than it has been in past contests, the result of an enormous GOP field, an increasingly nationalized primary race and a new cluster of early primary contests in the Republican-rich South.

New Hampshire Republicans say they have not seen much of Walker — or Sen. Marco Rubio (Fla.), Sen. Ted Cruz (Tex.) and former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee, who skipped a candidate forum here on Monday night. Another forum-skipper was real estate magnate Donald Trump, who is leading in the polls and only recently started taking regular trips to the state.
[The Take: For a brief moment, N.H. becomes a Trump-free zone]
Former Florida governor Jeb Bush is making a heavy push in New Hampshire, although some of the most frequent guests in the state are those in the GOP race's second tier — including New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, former New York governor George Pataki, Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (S.C.) and former Hewlett-Packard executive Carly Fiorina.
Locals say that the race is wide open and that a win is attainable by any candidate who is willing to spend time in the state, meeting with as many voters and answering as many questions as possible. But it remains to be seen who is willing to do that.
Meanwhile, several Southern states are relishing early visits from a host of presidential contenders. These voters are much less accustomed to seeing presidential candidates stop by their favorite breakfast joints and much more likely to ask for photos or hugs than to press for pithy answers to nuanced policy questions. The region has many wealthy Republican donors, lawmakers are eager to help and liberal activists haven't spent decades studying ways to capitalize on presidential candidate visits. Plus, the local media are more likely to devote entire articles or evening news segments to a candidate's visit.
At least seven Southern states are joining together to hold their primaries on March 1, right on the heels of the first round of February nominating contests in Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina and Nevada. This has come to be called the SEC primary, although the list of states participating — Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Texas and Virginia — doesn't perfectly match the roster of state schools in the famed athletic conference. Louisiana will hold its contest four days later, on March 5, followed by Mississippi on March 8 and then Florida and North Carolina on March 15.
“The candidates are not going to say this, but I will: There's a lot more to this than just Iowa. They have to look and see what's next,” said Georgia Secretary of State Brian Kemp (R), who pushed for the SEC primary and has been its biggest cheerleader.

Kemp rattles off signs of momentum: In early July, Huckabee and Cruz were both at the same mega-church in Milner, a tiny town in middle-of-nowhere central Georgia. Soon after, Walker held a private fundraiser in Atlanta, where several attendees said they were looking forward to a series of such events this summer, including a visit from Bush. Many candidates will be in Atlanta this weekend for the RedState Gathering, sponsored by the popular conservative RedState Web site.
Cruz is focusing heavily on Iowa and the South, and on Friday, he will kick off a seven-day, 20-stop bus tour of eight Southern states aimed at galvanizing conservatives. A news release announcing his trip noted that the region is home to 356 of the 1,236 delegates who will decide the Republican nominee.
[‘You saying I'm washed up?': Memorable lines from N.H. candidates forum]
Some strategists caution not to place too much importance on the SEC primary idea, saying that each presidential contest brings some newfangled strategy — only to see Iowa or New Hampshire still matter. But this year is different because the primary schedule is condensed, with the Iowa caucuses pushed back to February from January.
“History has shown that you don't have to win New Hampshire, but you have to do well enough here,” said Chris Galdieri, a political science professor at St. Anselm College in Manchester. “There just comes a point in the campaign where even the most generous super PAC backer is going to stop throwing good money after bad.”
Rubio — who has no natural connection to any of the four states that hold the earliest contests — is trying to compete in all of them in hopes of developing a following in at least one. He has reserved television advertising time in the states and has campaigned in each at least once since announcing his campaign in April.
For Walker, who is considered a favorite in Iowa, New Hampshire is a balancing act. He swears he is not ignoring the state, saying that claim is an inaccurate narrative floated by rival campaigns.
During a campaign stop at Theo's Pizza and Restaurant on Monday, he bragged that it was his 11th event in the state this year. What he didn't mention is that he held the same number of events during a single weekend in Iowa last month.
Independents are allowed to vote in the New Hampshire primary and the political mood is much more moderate, especially on social issues such as same-sex marriage and abortion rights, where Walker has been staking out very conservative positions. Voters here are known for being stubbornly opinionated and carry their first-in-the-nation primary responsibility with a regal air. So the chances of Walker getting tripped up here are higher.
[Earlier: As ‘SEC primary' takes shape, will presidential contenders show up?]
Walker has not held a town hall meeting — a New Hampshire tradition — and has kept his staffing in the state small compared with that in Iowa. His campaign was missing from Fourth of July festivities, and he has bounced around in the early polls, sometimes registering only in the single digits.
Supporters brush off such criticism and say Walker has the potential to do quite well in New Hampshire. Walker plans to return soon for a Harley-Davidson ride with Scott Brown, a former senator from Massachusetts who ran for a Senate seat in New Hampshire last year and lost.
David Sherman, 64, a volunteer from New Boston, says he asked the Walker campaign why it isn't spending more time in his state. He said the past three venues that held Walker campaign events were packed and he urged the campaign to think bigger.
“They told me he doesn't want to peak too soon,” said Sherman, who describes Walker as a rare politician whom he wants to take fishing. “I think he should get out there and stay there.”
State Rep. Brian Gallagher, an early Walker supporter, says the candidate's strategy is to “do small group by small group over time” so that locals get to know Walker personally.
As Walker neared the end of his time at Theo's Pizza on Monday, he stopped to chat at a table of retirees. One woman started listing things he should do in New Hampshire, including stopping by a farmer's produce stand.
“Tomorrow, I go back,” Walker said, adding: “We'll be back.”

It's not just the usual suspects who are opposing the proposed Keystone XL pipeline, a 1,700 mile oil spills waiting to happen. A key group that is organizing against the pipeline are landowners who don't like a Canadian company, TransCanada, threatening their land and access to safe, clean water. In Nebraska, the pipeline would cross over the Ogallala aquifer, which supplies groundwater for irrigation to 30 percent of the US. That's part of the reason why Randy Thompson, a Nebraska landowner from Merrick County has been fighting TransCanada for years. Yesterday Randy wrote to Nebraska's attorney general and asked him to investigate TransCanada for alleged "deceptive and perhaps fraudulent" tactics used to bully him off his land.
As Nebraska citizens we are asking you, our State Attorney General, to launch a full and comprehensive investigation into the trade practices of TransCanada, a foreign corporation that has been seeking easements for a massive tar sands oil pipeline across our state. It is our opinion that TransCanada has used deceptive and perhaps fraudulent tactics trying to convince landowners to grant such easements to their company. TransCanada does not have a permit from the U.S. government to build this pipeline in our country, and yet they have been aggressively pursuing easements from Nebraska landowners. They have sent letters to many landowners threatening to use eminent domain to acquire these easements if the owners would not agree to accept the terms set forth by TransCanada. These letters have caused a lot of anguish for landowners and their families who don't want to have this pipeline on their land, but don't have the resources to fight a multi-billion dollar foreign corporation. Senator Johanns and other legal authorities have expressed the opinion that TransCanada has been a operating way out-of-bounds regarding their authority when claiming to possess the powers of eminent domain at this stage of the permitting process. We believe that TransCanada has used these false claims of eminent domain powers to intimidate landowners into signing unwanted easement agreements.
Last week, Nebraska Gov. Dave Heineman, sent a letter to the president asking him to deny a permit for the project. You can find out more about Randy's fight at www.standwithrandy.com.
It remains to be seen what President Obama will do. The State department is now in its "National Interest" phase of its decision, in which it will seek to determine if the pipeline is in the national interest. It's certainly not in Randy Thompson's.
The Next Middle East War, Post-ISIS
Islamic State is in fatal decline. The Middle East will soon enter a new era, post-Islamic State, dominated by the Saudi-Iranian power struggle. The struggle will, as it has as it ran alongside the fight against Islamic State, involve shifting Sunni and Shiite allegiances. But the fight is not about religion. Religion this time has more to do with complicating choices in political bedfellows and where proxies are recruited than dogma. For behind that Sunni-Shiite curtain, this is a classic geopolitical power struggle — for control of Iraq and Syria, and for expanding diplomatic and strategic reach throughout the region.
In the fight against Islamic State, it has been all too easy to cite expediency in putting complex issues aside, but as the alliances created for that struggle run their course, the new reality will force changes. With the strategic value of funding Islamic State as a bulwark against Iranian influence in Iraq gone, the Saudis appear to be pivoting toward building warmer relations with the Shiite government in Baghdad. That a Saudi airline is just now announcing the first return of direct service between the two countries since Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait in 1990 is no coincidence, nor is it an isolated event
The Saudis also appear willing to let a lot of religious water pass under the bridge to take advantage of a looming intra-Shiite power struggle in Baghdad among Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi, former Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki (above), and Shiite cleric Muqtada al-Sadr. Sadr, the most religiously zealous Shiite of the group, has always been something of a nationalist, and unlike his rivals, is wary of Iranian influence. It is perhaps not surprising that he has made friendly trips to Sunni Riyadh and the United Arab Emirates, the first time in 11 years done under official invitation from Saudi Arabia.
Sadr is an interesting choice for the Saudis to use to gain influence in Baghdad. Real progress for Riyadh means untangling years of close Iranian cooperation in Iraq, to include limiting the power of the Iranian-backed militias. Sadr has significant influence among the militias, and can use his religious credibility to sell Saudi cooperation to the vast numbers of his followers who remember well the Saudis funded al Qaeda in Iraq and Islamic State's killing of so many Shiites over the years. Further enhancing Sadr's Shiite religious status can thus further Sunni Saudi goals. During his visit, the Saudis gifted Sadr with $10 million for “rebuilding,” but also astutely threw in some special visas for this year's Hajj pilgrimage for Sadr to distribute.
One should not, however, sell Iran short. Its ties to officials in Baghdad are a tiny part of a deep relationship forged in the bloody fight against the American occupiers. Iranian special forces then helped defeat Islamic State, Iranian money continues to support Iraq, and the Shiite militias who will suddenly have a lot less to occupy their time post-Islamic State are still mostly under Iranian influence. In the absence of any effective national army, no government will stand long in Baghdad without militia support. At the moment, Iran is way ahead in Iraq.
Iran is also likely to be a winner in Syria. Islamic State's defeat will significantly lessen Sunni influence there, and Iran's role as Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's protector will only increase in value now that it appears Assad will remain in control of some portion of the country. The Saudis backed the wrong team and are left with little influence.
In addition to a strong hand in Iraq and Syria, Iran is also probably the most stable Muslim nation in the Middle East. It has existed more or less within its current borders for thousands of years, and is largely religiously, culturally, and linguistically homogeneous (though keep an eye on the Kurdish minority.) While still governed in significant part by its clerics, the country has held a series of increasingly democratic electoral transitions since the 1979 revolution. And unlike the Saudis, Iran's leaders do not rule in fear of an Islamic revolution. They already had one.
Power struggles create flashpoints, and the Saudi-Iranian struggle post-Islamic State is no exception.
The Saudi-Iranian proxy war in Yemen has settled into a version of World War I-style trench warfare, with neither side strong enough to win nor weak enough to lose. In an ugly form of stasis, the conflict seems likely to stay within its present borders.
A potential powder keg however lies in Kurdistan. The Kurds, a de facto state arguably since 2003, did the one thing they weren't allowed to do, pull the tiger's tale by holding a formal independence referendum . That vote required everyone with a stake to consider their next moves instead of leaving well enough alone.
Iran, and the Iranian-backed government now in Baghdad, are clear they will not tolerate an actual Kurdish state. With Islamic State defeated, those governments will simultaneously lose the need to make nice to keep the Kurds in that fight and find themselves with combat-tested Shiite militias ready for the next task. Following a Shiite move against the Kurds, and stymied in Yemen, imagine the Saudis throwing their support into the fight, and a new proxy war will be underway right on Iran's own western border.
While it may seem odd to write about the balance of power in the Middle East leaving out the United States, that may very well describe America's range of options post-Islamic State.
The United States, which did so much via its unnecessary invasion of Iraq and tragic handling of the post-war period to nurture the growth of Islamic State, seems the least positioned of all players to find a place in a post-Islamic State Middle East. American influence in Baghdad is limited, and with Washington having declared its opposition to the Kurdish independence referendum , likely limited in Erbil as well. Detente with Iran is in shambles under the Trump administration, leaving Washington with few options other than perhaps supporting the Saudis in whatever meddling they do in Iraq.
Having followed his predecessor's single minded “strategy” of simply “destroy Islamic State,” there are no signs the Trump administration has any ideas about what to do next, and with the military exhausted and the State Department apparently sitting out international relations at present, it is unclear if any will emerge. It will soon be mission accomplished for America with nothing much to follow. And if that sounds familiar, echoing back to 2003, well, then you understand how things got to where they are.

For those who had their doubts about the politics behind the Bush administration's “war on terrorism,” Tom Ridge's new book will fuel long-held suspicions.
The former Republican governor of Pennsylvania, who was the first head of the Department of Homeland Security, says two top Bush officials – Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld and Attorney General John Ashcroft – pressured him to up the terror alert level before the 2004 election, according to promotional materials by publisher Macmillan.
“Ridge also charges that he was often ‘blindsided' during daily morning briefings with Bush because the FBI withheld information from him, and says he was never invited to sit in on National Security Council meetings,” reports AFP.
Former Bush officials have been quick to push back on Ridge's revelation.
Frances Frago Townsend, who coordinated homeland security matters at the National Security Council under President Bush, said Ridge is “absolutely wrong” in his allegation. “Politics played no part in any discussion” of the Homeland Security Council, Ms. Townsend insists in The Atlantic.
Not surprisingly, Ridge's news has ricocheted around cable TV, radio talk shows, and the blogosphere.
Kansas City Star columnist Yael Abouhalkah says Ridge's “serious charges” are “scathing.”
“An abuse so gross – if Ridge is right – shows, among other things, what a powerful influence on the all-important tracking polls terror alerts must have had,” writes Ben Smith on Politico.com. “And it suggests that Obama's efforts to keep terror arrests out of the national news are good politics too.”
On the other hand, Jay Bookman, columnist and deputy editorial page editor of The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, dug back into news stories from the summer of 2004 to find that Ridge may not have been the total white knight his publicists claim.
An Associated Press story with a lead that described the essence of John Kerry's failing presidential campaign – “The politics of terrorism has Democrats tied in knots” – has Ridge warning of “possible al-Qaeda terrorist attacks to financial institutions in New York City, Washington, and Newark, N.J.”
In other words, he wasn't always fighting off the pressure to send sober warnings that just happened to benefit his boss running for reelection from the White House in the middle of a war that wasn't going all that well. The AP story went on to point out that “the Bush administration let a 24-hour news cycle pass before acknowledging that most of the intelligence, while recently obtained, was three or four years old.”
Not long after the election that November, Ridge resigned.
“After that episode [involving Ashcroft and Rumsfeld], I knew I had to follow through with my plans to leave the federal government for the private sector,” Ridge writes in “The Test of Our Times: America Under Siege ... And How We Can Be Safe Again.”
It's not unusual for former government officials to recount their version of history – for profit and as a means of shaping their reputation. Five years later, Tom Ridge is doing just that.

SMYRNA, Del.- Less than a week after a hostage incident at the James T. Vaughn Correctional Center that left a correctional officer dead, there has been another violent incident at the maximum-security prison near Smyrna, according to the Correctional Officers Association of Delaware.
The union said in a press release that on Tuesday during showers the inmates were yelling and threatening the officers. According to the union, one inmate in particular was unruly and reportedly shouted again and again that he was going to kill all of the officers. The union said that when ordered into his cell, the inmate threw his belongings into the cell and allegedly said, "I'm taking one of you with me." The inmate then punched one officer in the face and fought others until he was finally restrained, according to the union. The union said the officer suffered cuts to the nose and forehead and bruising around the eyes.
The union said that part of the problem is an agreement the state signed with the ACLU back in August that puts mental health advocates between the officers and the inmates. The union claims the problems arise when the advocate tells the inmate not to obey the officer.
In response to the union's press release, Delaware Department of Correction Commissioner Perry Phelps released the following statement:
"All individuals, whether mentally ill or severely mentally ill, are held accountable for their actions within acceptable medical guidelines. The individual accused of assaulting an officer at James T. Vaughn Correctional Center on Feb. 7 was not on the mental health roster. In fact, he had not been seen or requested services from our medical contractor since November of 2015 when he was processed in to the facility. There is no evidence to validate the claims that mental health staff interfered and instructed the offenders not to comply with DOC officials. We're confident Governor Carney's independent investigation will identify any areas of concern with policies or procedures surrounding security operations and mental health relationships.”
British weather is often seen as a drawback but a marketing campaign is hoping to use the nation's favourite talking point to attract foreigners. So can Britain's weather really boost tourism?
There is little Britons love moaning about more than the weather.
Barely a day passes without a familiar exchange along the lines of: "Isn't it terrible weather? Isn't it cold out?".
Indeed some would argue that - along with tea drinking and queueing - lamenting the weather is almost woven into British DNA.
But according to Culture Secretary Jeremy Hunt, Britain is selling itself short.
He says British weather is much better than both Britons and foreigners - who tend to think of Britain as a rainy and cold country - believe.
Announcing a government campaign to attract more tourists, he told the Times: "We have much lower rainfall than Paris. We have to make sure people understand the reality about the weather."
So could the weather actually be Britain's secret weapon?
The Independent's travel editor Simon Calder thinks the campaign might be on to something.
British weather facts The average number of days on which rain falls in London each year is less than in Paris, Santander (Spain) and Wellington (New Zealand)
London is drier than Rome, New York, Brisbane, Rio de Janeiro, and Tokyo

"It is the British way to grumble about our weather - but the more you travel, the more you understand that we enjoy a wonderfully diverse yet usually benign climate.
"San Diego in California may claim the balmiest weather, and Phoenix, Arizona, the sunniest, but ours is much more interesting," he says.
Far from bemoaning the weather's changeability, travel writer Hilary Bradt agrees that it is its variety that makes it so exciting.
"There is nothing monotonous about the British weather, and it's because of its variety that we have such wonderful landscapes and countryside.
"I used to live in California, and actually the relentless blue skies became very boring," she says.
But even if British weather is better - and more interesting - than people think, how easy is it to market?
According to Jonathan Gabay, a marketing expert and the founder of Brand Forensics, selling the weather is always going to be an uphill struggle.
Image caption Britons are accustomed to spells of heavy rainy
"A few years ago Israel ran a marketing campaign that showed the country wasn't all desert - it showed Tel Aviv - that was acceptable because it was fact.
"The trouble with the weather is that, even with statistics - for example saying the rainfall is actually x, even though you thought it was y - how on earth can you be sure it will happen? It's variable," he says.
As far as facts go, rain actually falls on fewer days a year in London than it does in Paris, Santander in Spain, and Wellington in New Zealand, according to VisitBritain.
Over the last 30 years, the average maximum temperature in July has been 20.6C in Teignmouth, Devon, 19.4C in Newton Rigg, Cumbria, and 22.8C in Greenwich, London, Met Office figures reveal.
That compares with 18C in Auchincruive, Ayrshire and 19C in Armagh.
Average rainfall in July between 1971-2000 Teignmouth, Devon - 36mm
Greenwich, London - 38mm
Newton Rigg, Cumbria - 66mm
Auchincruive, Ayrshire - 70mm
Armagh - 55mm Source: Met Office
But even with statistics, Bradt thinks it will be difficult to change people's perceptions - especially if it needs to start in Britain's own backyard.
"The campaign might be able to change foreigners attitudes - even though the strong perceptions of foggy Britain from the 60s and 70s still persist - but it will be difficult to change British attitudes.
"The British love complaining - it's either too hot or too cold, too wet or too dry - our whole culture is based on complaining about the weather, it's what binds people together," she says.
Gabay thinks there is also another factor at play. According to the branding expert, this is the era of the most cynical consumers ever, and toying with one of the things people most look forward to - their two-week break - is quite a risk.
"There are a couple of things that you don't mess with consumers over - one is religion, another is money - the past performance of a fund does not necessarily reflect its future performance - but perhaps the one that supersedes them all is their holiday," he says.

Newton Rigg, Cumbria - 22.3C
Auchincruive, Ayrshire - 19.9C
Armagh - 22.4C Source: Met Office
Rather than using the weather as a "hook", Gabay thinks it would be safer to focus on Britain's heritage, landscape or people.
"Admittedly not everyone wants hot weather, not everyone wants a beach. But if you are going to hedge your bets, people are go to Marbella rather than Manchester," he says.
However Calder believes Britain could do much more to market itself, especially off season, by pointing to some surprising features.
"For example in the lovely county of Somerset, the driest month is April. And its joint warmest month - with July - is May," he says.
So where does Calder think is the best weather in Britain?
"Scotland, by a mile, where a day without at least two or three seasons represented is unusual," he says.
The premise for “Roadies,” a music drama that chronicles the lives of a popular rock band's road crew, originated back in 2008, executive producer J.J. Abrams told Variety Monday night at the Showtime series' Los Angeles premiere.
Though Abrams and “Roadies” creator Cameron Crowe discussed the project for a number of years, neither was sure if the series would ever come to fruition. That was until Crowe paid a visit to Abrams' Bad Robot Productions a few years ago and began penning the script.
“He wrote a script that was, for years, this thing I'd been hoping I would get to read, which is Cameron Crowe's experience with the people who are in the shadows running these shows that never get any of the spotlight or recognition– it's the passion of music that brings them together,” said Abrams, clarifying that “only Cameron could have done this.”
Crowe also commented on the writer-producer duo's longtime relationship, adding “We made a promise to each other that if I were to ever enjoy the benefits of working in TV, we'd do it together.”
Like Crowe's 2000 drama “Almost Famous,” which drew inspiration from Crowe's stint as a music journalist and earned the auteur his first Oscar, “Roadies” boasts a “based in reality” storyline.
“We either saw it, knew it happened, heard it happened or knew it to be true, so that everything would be authentic,” Crowe said of “Roadies'” plot details.
The pair was joined on the red carpet, which was stationed at Downtown Los Angeles' historic Theatre at Ace Hotel, by co-stars Luke Wilson, Carla Gugino, Imogen Poots, Rafe Spall, Peter Cambor, Richard Colson Baker (aka Machine Gun Kelly) and executive producer Winnie Holzman.
“Roadies” premieres June 26 on Showtime.
Plunging into the skies of Japan, Yves Rossy, known as Jetman, streaked through the clouds by the country's famous Mount Fuji. It was the latest locale for the former 54 year-old Swiss pilot who has dedicated 10 years to his passion of flying in the most natural way possible. What would be terrifying for most, enthralls Rossy. He says being thrust through the air with only a jet pack on his back was like being in the palms of a giant hand. "You feel that you have pressure everywhere, and that's the magic moment. Because full trust like that, you have aerodynamic and it's like a big hand on your back and yes, it holds! And you fly." Two meter (6.5 ft.) wide Kevlar wings and four jet engines allow a flight time of up to 13 minutes. That was enough to propel Rossy around the sacred volcano nine times. "That's a fantastic privilege to be a little mosquito flying in front of that big mountain." Japan's Mt. Fuji joins a list of other iconic spots where the Jetman has flown including the United State's Grand Canyon and the English Channel.
Bilyeu, formerly a star defender for Southern Illinois-Edwardsville, currently plays for the New York Red Bulls of Major League Soccer (MLS).
After his stellar career at SIUE – which included being a three-time All-Missouri Valley Conference pick and making the NSCAA All-West Region honorable-mention list – Bilyeu was selected by the Red Bulls as the 18th pick of the first round in the MLS Superdraft on Jan. 14. Bilyeu is the second Cougars drafted in the first round by an MLS team, joining Matt Polster, who was taken seventh overall in 2015, according to siuecougars.com.
“Just pure excitement and realization of a dream come true, and definitely being around my family when I saw the pick happen was incredible,” Bilyeu told the Metro East Sun about being drafted.
Bilyeu joined the team near the end of January and immediately realized during training sessions that while he knew players at the MLS level were good, he didn't realize how good until he started working with them.
“To be honest, the first couple of weeks were just a whirlwind, trying to get used to the style of play and speed of play and how good these guys were,” Bilyeu said.
However, as the year has progressed, he said he's gotten used to it, become a better player and come to realize he can play at that level.
“(I'm) just listening to advice from the different veteran players or the coaches and taking it all in, and just really going out there and taking it one training session at a time and getting better every day,” Bilyeu said.
There was also some culture shock in moving from Edwardsville to the biggest city in the country, with its greater traffic, pace and cost of living.
“It's a completely different lifestyle, and it's definitely tough to get used to, but it's all right right now,” Bilyeu said.
Bilyeu's first appearance in an MLS game came on April 29 in a home game against FC Dallas. Bilyeu came on late in the game and played for 10 minutes as a substitute. Bilyeu was warming up on the sideline when the kit man held up his jersey, indicating that he was going into the game.
“When I saw my jersey go up, I was, like, completely shocked because I didn't expect to go in, and then just standing there and waiting for the sub to happen, it was kind of a realization that I am about to make my dream come true,” Bilyeu said. “Then once I stepped onto the field, all that went away, and I was completely focused on what I had to do to finish out the game and help the team.”
Bilyeu then got his first MLS start on June 22 at Real Salt Lake, and subbed in for 17 minutes on July 31 at Chicago.
Bilyeu said it was a difficult adjustment period going from being a regular starter at SIUE to playing behind other players in MLS, but he also knew a lot of playing time wasn't in the cards given how much talent and experience the Red Bulls have. Bilyeu still was able to appreciate where he is at.
“It's just incredible to be a part of, to step back and, you know, see everything unfold, for sure,” Bilyeu said.
Going down would be humiliating for a club who has played in every Premier League season, but trust Aston Villa to miss out on the new TV money
Aston Villa have become the laughing stock of the Premier League this season. They are rock bottom, with just two wins from 23 league games. The transfer window was an embarrassing farce of failed negotiations and rejections from players. The mere thought of interest from the club forced Nemanja Vidic into retirement. But who is really losing out here? Is it the players, whose reputations are being damaged by the minute, or the fans, who shell out a large portion of their wages to watch players run about with little passion for the famous colours of claret and blue? It's the fans, of course.
For us Villa fans, it has become an embarrassingly desperate campaign. I find myself getting excited when we score a single goal. We may be two, three or even four down by the time we manage it, but the mere achievement of putting the ball in the net has me giddy with joy. It's a sad state of affairs; this club won the European Cup in 1982. We were the greatest team in Europe and have been members of the Premier League since its inception. But now, after five years of fighting relegation, we are finally going to drop a division.
How football is trying to tackle the growing issue of players' mental health Read more
For anyone who follows the Villa, it is no surprise that we have chosen this year of all years to finally give up. With the new TV deal coming into force next season, financially speaking, this is the worst season in the history of the Premier League to be relegated.
It is a scary proposition. Some fans think Villa will be well equipped to bounce straight back up from the Championship next season, but I'm not so sure. Uninspiring displays against lower league opponents in the cup competitions over the past few years suggest Villa could go down and stay down for a while. Leeds United, Blackburn Rovers, Nottingham Forest, Coventry City and Birmingham City were all Premier League regulars, but they now serve as proof that no club is too big to suffer. It is possible to fall from grace and become stuck in the lower leagues. This is the fate that could lie ahead for Villa.
Many observers will say that this misery stems from losing Martin O'Neill as manager and that the club has never been the same since. To a point that is true but I think O'Neill left because he saw this coming. The hierarchy at the club had begun to sell the players with most potential and we were becoming a feeder club for those in higher positions in the league. O'Neill spotted this, disagreed with it and left. And he was right.
Since his departure, Villa have been either unable or unwilling to hold on to their best players. The sales of Fabian Delph and Christian Benteke last summer are just the most recent examples. Randy Lerner's reign as owner has been a long line of mismanagement and disappointment. He may have invested heavily in the infrastructure, but Villa have been run as a business and not a football club, even with the threat of relegation looming.
A new chairman, Steve Hollis, has been appointed. To most clubs this would be a great thing, but for Villa it was another opportunity to hire a man with no football experience. The new chairman is a local businessman, brought in to make the club a more financially lucrative operation. What doesn't seem to have been considered, however, is that a successful team is a lot more attractive to everybody, including sponsors and business partners.
So, how does it feel to be a Villa fan? Depressing. We have become so used to underachievement that missing out on the bumper TV deal comes as no surprise. We had accepted relegation by Christmas and are even accepting that our club has become the butt of the jokes - some of them are even quite funny now. The only hope is that Villa will bounce back and live up to the memories we have of a big club with one of the best and most traditional stadiums in the country.

A new study has indicated that people who suffer from morbid obesity may be contributing to a shortage of organs for donation and may actually be decreasing the amount of living kidney donors available to give to others.
In an analysis of 104 potential kidney donors, researchers at the Hofstra North Shore-LIJ School of Medicine and Feinstein Institute for Medical Research found that 23 percent of the patients were classified as morbidly obese. A person who is classified as morbidly obese is not able to donate an organ.
The researchers also found that only 18% of study participants fell into a normal weight range. The remaining participants ranged from overweight to morbidly obese.
Dr. Mala Sachdeva, assistant professor of medicine at the Hofstra North Shore-LIJ School of Medicine and researcher at the Feinstein Institute for Medical Research said in a statement published by Fox News,
“This is the first time the pre-donation period was studied [in regards to organ transplants],…Nobody has studied the pre-donation period and how many are excluded based on obesity. Just looking at these findings, we can definitely see obesity is a problem here. On a local level, we're seeing it's limiting the number of living donors, and it needs to be explored on a national level. I would not be surprised if we see similar findings. Something needs to be done – we can't wait on this. We have more than 92 candidates on the waiting list for a kidney transplant, and nearly a quarter of people who could donate are excluded based on obesity.”
The study encompasses everyone who came to a Long Island hospital over a three year period, from 2008-2011, to donate a kidney. The study's lead researchers say this study shows that the results are probably similar nationwide.
Obese people are largely considered bad candidates for organ transplantation due to the strain the surgery and healing will put on their bodies. At times, Obese donors are put on diet and behavior management programs and doctors chart their progress monthly to determine if their eligibility has changed. Only 3% of those who try to lose the weight and become donors succeed.
Sachdeva offered the following recommendation for obese participants:
“We need to target that 30 percent who are really motivated to lose weight. What can we do differently? We could put them in a more rigorous weight loss program, have closer follow-up, offer motivational support groups or even in some participants – if their BMI permits – consider bariatric surgery.”
Sachdeva was adamant that obesity needs to be addressed nationally as one of the biggest problems facing the healthcare world today.
CLEVELAND, Ohio -- Clevelanders will get a chance to watch Josh Denny chow down on some of the city's biggest meals on the Food Network this Friday. The upcoming episode of "Ginormous Food" will feature Greater Cleveland restaurants that aren't shy with their portions.
"Cleveland is definitely a city that I think is built for a show like ours," says Denny.
One of the dishes that will make the show will be the Godzilla Roll at Shinto Experience in Strongsville, which Denny says was the first Japanese restaurant to be featured on "Ginormous Food."
"The last thing I would've expected to get in Cleveland is amazing sushi. You would think you would have to go to the coast or to Florida," says Denny, adding that the restaurant developed a good balance between Midwestern flavors and Japanese traditions.
Denny also dined on the giant Mount Olympus Gyro at Greek Village Grille in Lakewood, which the host says was the "best Greek food (they have) had on the show so far."
"I love when we do places like that because it's like a little hole in the wall," says Denny. "It's really great food and the guys who work there are characters."
The third restaurant featured in the episode is Banter in Cleveland, and, of course, Denny had to check out the Polish Big Boy. The Cleveland classic dish is completely transformed into a massive sandwich that looks like a burger. Denny says the dish featured the equivalent of nearly 20 sausages on one giant bun.
"(Banter) was one of my favorite restaurants we ate at this whole season," Denny said.
The premise of the show, which aired in July 2016, is pretty simple. Denny travels to different cities all over the country in search of unusually large meals. Other nearby cities Denny has visited Pittsburgh and Cincinnati.
When looking for restaurants to feature on the show, Denny and his crew try to maintain an element of surprise by picking restaurants viewers wouldn't normally expect to see in a particular city. He added that he was "surprised" at the amount of diversity in the Cleveland food scene.
"Whether you're in the suburbs or you're right downtown ... the food is elevated," Denny said. "I think (the food in Cleveland) really stands out in its own way."
The show is in its second season and the Cleveland episode will be episode nine. The episode airs Friday at 8 p.m. on Food Network.

Watching the clever Border Collie, Tex, win the 2015 Westminster Dog Agility Contest or the whip-quick retriever, Joy, earn the large dog agility prize at the Purina Pro Plan Incredible Dog Challenge is enough to get your tail wagging, even if you don't have a dog. The speed and discipline these canine competitors exhibit is inspirational. So, it's no surprise that many pet owners get into agility training for dogs as a form of bonding and a fun way to exercise.
We all know how much energy dogs have to spare and we don't often have enough time to walk or run them as much as we would like. Agility training is a perfect way to train your dog and make good use of all that pent up energy. It also makes the best of their competitive nature.
Dog agility training also requires obedience skills, making it good for dogs that have never taken a class before or for those needing to brush up on good behavior. It gives your pooch something to focus on and somewhere to channel his energy. Agility training is highly recommended for dogs of all ages.
The sport itself is surprisingly young. It started in the UK in the late 1970's as a way to entertain spectators during intermission at a traditional dog show. The sport caught on like wildfire and soon dogs all over the world were learning how to leap, tunnel, and weave.
But, it takes a special kind of dog to do well at canine agility competitions and a strong bond between dog and handler to succeed. Certain breeds excel at agility, in much the same way as a particular pedigree might lend itself more readily to hunting or herding than others.
If you're interested in getting started in the exciting world of dog agility, here are some tips and tricks for beginners.

Agility Training for Dogs
The Ultimate Beginners Guide
Aside from fame and adoration, agility training for dogs is a great way for canines and master (or mistress) to bond.
Learning to communicate well with your animal will not only help her learn her place in your family's “pack,” but will also help her behave when you go into the vet's office for your next checkup.
It will take a lot of patience, time, and dedication, so make sure you've got all three in spades before you invest a good deal of money in training courses or expensive equipment. Agility training for dogs is not the same as obedience training and it should not be used in its place.

Obedience Training vs. Agility Training for Dogs
Obedience training can start from puppyhood but dogs should be over one year old before any intense agility training begins. Before that age, their skeletons have not matured enough. After that first year, age is no barrier. Indeed, even very old dogs can learn to be more agile, but go gently with them.
Obedience training teaches dogs to understand basic commands such as ‘sit', ‘stand', ‘stay', ‘down', ‘fetch' and ‘leave', and little barks as a polite greeting. Agility training for dogs builds on these skills. Your dog will learn how to negotiate tunnels, tires, A-frames, high and long jumps and see-saws.
The training takes place around a set course, and if on a competitive level, training is carried out against the clock. At competition level, the dogs compete against others for the fewest faults in the fastest time. For general exercise, not in the competition arena, the dog owner or handler walks or runs around the course and directs and controls the dog while he's off his leash.

The Right Dog for the Job
You can either begin with a dog you already have a good relationship with, or scout out new talent. As previously mentioned, some types of dogs do better than others when it comes to agility. Jumping, abrupt changes in direction, and crawling are all activities that are hard on a dog's joints.
Breeds that are prone to joint problems, such as shepherds, retrievers, Great Danes, and Dachshunds may not be the best candidates. Also, very young dogs and mature dogs can hurt their joints more easily. You should consult with your veterinarian about a joint dog supplement if your dog will be doing dog agility training on a regular basis.
A dog must also possess the right temperament in order to do well in agility training for dogs and competing. He should be well socialized, so that he behaves appropriately around crowds and other dogs.
Dogs that get bored easily or get into mischief when unsupervised are also great choices, as these qualities normally indicate intelligence. Starting a dog agility training routine may even serve to correct some undesired behavior, as it may satisfy a dog's curiosity and desire to learn.
You'll also learn to communicate on a whole new level, making discipline outside of the arena easier too.
Talk to a veterinarian about your dog's ability to perform tasks commonly associated with dog agility. Make sure you're up-to-date on all of the recommended shots as well. This is an entrance requirement for most dog shows as well as a good precaution in case your dog gets into a scuffle with someone else's.
You can never be certain of how well-trained your competition will be or how responsible the other owners are. Even if your dog knows the basic commands and follows them well, there's no guarantee another dog won't start trouble. It's best to be on the safe side when it comes to vaccines.

Equipment for Agility Training for Dogs
Once you have a dog that you want to work with, you might wish to set up a training course in your yard. Alternatively, you could stock up on portable equipment that can be set up in the park or an open meadow. Equipment doesn't have to be expensive either.
While you can certainly purchase tire jumps, weave poles, and A-frames that have been manufactured especially for dogs, you could also source materials from junkyards, scrap piles, or second-hand shops.
Just make sure that whatever you decide to use is in good enough condition that it doesn't pose a hazard to your animal. Check for rusty parts, sharp edges, and structural defects before you decide to implement any equipment in agility training for dogs.

Obstacles you're likely to run into on a competitive course can be broken down into four basic categories: jumps, tunnels, contact obstacles, and miscellaneous. Here's a quick rundown of standard agility obstacles used by agility clubs:
A-frame: The A-frame is a pair of planks joined in the middle at an angle so that they resemble the peak of the letter A. There are “contact” areas indicated by contrasting colors which are painted on the frame and dictate where the dog must step. The dog must go up one side and down the other, contacting the plank in the right places on each side.
Seesaw: This obstacle looks just like what you might see on a playground, with one plank supported in the middle, so that either side can be lowered toward the ground. The dog will start at one end and walk to the other, while the plank shifts with the dog's weight. Some clubs require that this obstacle have grips or treads on them, as a safety measure.
Tunnels: There are a couple of different types of tunnels used in agility competition. One type is a tube with a U-shaped bend that is made of joined rigid hoops. Another style consists of a stiff collar-like tunnel, usually only a few feet long, that has a length of fabric fastened to one end. The dog goes in through the collar portion and must find its way out from under the collapsed fabric portion.
Jumps: Like the tunnel obstacle, jumps can vary in design. Most jumps look just like miniature versions of the hurdles used in equestrian competitions. In fact, this is where the first obstacle designers got their inspiration. There may also be tire jumps, fence jumps, and log jumps.
Weave Poles: This one might be the most exciting element to watch a dog complete, but can be one of the most challenging to train for. If you've ever seen a ski slalom race, you already have a good idea of what the dog will need to do to get through this obstacle. Several vertical poles are set up in a row and the dog must weave its way back and forth between them in a snake-like fashion.
The best way to decide which obstacles to train for is to take a look at which local competitions you're interested in entering. Find out which club the competition is associated with and hop on their website to see what their regulations are. You can even watch videos of previous competitions to get an idea of what will be expected.

Dog Agility Training Classes
When attending classes on agility training for dogs, it is recommended that you get to the venue well before the start time so you'll be able to walk your dog around the course. This will warm him up and give your dog a chance to have a sniff around and explore! Make sure you bring a doggy poop plastic bag to pick up any ‘deposits'!
Many classes work on a reward basis so it is important not to feed your dog before a class, except for a very light snack and let him have a drink of water if he wants one. Often classes will provide snacks or a meal for your dog once class is over, but do bring your own food and treats if the class you're attending doesn't do this.
Some ideas of treats to bring can be small pieces of chicken, liver, sausage, bacon, beef or lamb, dried foods or any favorite foods your dog especially likes. Keep dog treats to hand in a small bag in your pocket or in a special treat bag that can be bought in most pet stores.
Keep your dog on a leash at all times as well, unless instructed otherwise by the trainer in charge. It is generally advisable to avoid the use of retractable leashes, as they are too long and lack the control of a standard leash – especially when there are lots of other interesting dogs your pooch might want to investigate.
Avoid choke chains or chain leashes as well, as they can hurt your dog and he will begin to associate pain and that choking feeling with going to the agility course. Remember, it's supposed to be fun for both of you – you can even bring some toys for your dog to play with after the training session is over.
It's a good idea to bring wash cloths and towels too, so you can wash some of the mud off your dog if your course is outdoors, and to dry him off after his training. Depending on the weather conditions and forecast, ensure you wear comfortable clothing.
Wear boots if it's muddy and a raincoat and sweater for cold weather and the rain. Much of the time you will be walking or perhaps running with your dog so comfortable footwear and jogging pants are a must.

Tips to Find More Information on Dog Agility Training
To find a list of clubs and answers to more agility competition questions, there are several reliable online resources. Check out the North American Dog Agility Council's list of clubs arranged in numerical order by zip code.
You can try the American Kennel Club's agility page for a smorgasbord of information, including an agility FAQ and club policies. The oldest agility competition tournament in the U.S. is hosted by the United States Dog Agility Association and you can find a lot of great information on their website.
There are a great number of books available on the topic agility training for dogs too. Sniff around at your local library for books and even videos that can give you a good idea of what will be involved with your new endeavor. Go to a few shows in your city or state and try to speak with the competitors after the event.
You can likely also find several professional trainers that you can hire to work with both you and your canine partner. Poke your nose in a variety of places and identify which resources are available to you.

You're Ready to Get Started
Remember to start off your agility training for dogs very slowly and once your canine has mastered the course you can work on his speed and accuracy or even add more obstacles. Make sure you provide plenty of water for your dog, it will be thirsty work! And the most important tip? Give him lots of praise for all the awesome tricks he's learned!
Remember that you don't need to bring home trophies to enjoy agility training for dogs. It will be good exercise for both of you, increase your ability to communicate with each other, give you another reason to interact, and strengthen your bond. You may even discover some new friends while trading training tips with other dog owners.
In the end, it's not a matter of winning or losing, but how the two of you get there together and what you find along the journey. Ribbons and awards are just icing on the cake!

Montreal mayoral candidate Valérie Plante isn't saying which way she voted in Quebec's 1995 sovereignty referendum.
"Listen, if I had liked to put those issues forward, I think I would have been at the provincial or federal level," Valérie Plante, leader of opposition Projet Montréal, said in an interview on CBC Montreal's Daybreak.
I'm really open to work with everybody, whatever language, wherever they come from. - Projet Montréal mayoral candidate Valérie Plante
Plante, 43, told Daybreak host Mike Finnerty that although she doesn't identify as a separatist, she believes in the importance of "auto-determination" as a democratic right.
Her opponent, incumbent Mayor Denis Coderre, is a former federal Liberal cabinet minister and an avowed federalist.
Coderre, however, has admitted in the past that he would have voted for separation in the 1980 referendum (he was only 17 at the time). A number of sovereigntists are either running for his party or are part of his campaign team.
When asked on Daybreak why she refrained from responding, Plante said it was a "tricky question" on an all-round sensitive topic.
"I'm so proud to speak French and English," she said. "I'm really open to work with everybody, whatever language, wherever they come from."
For Plante, the fact that Montreal is a French city is an asset — but she said she still believes it's important to be conscious of the city's anglophone population.
"We should be able to get some services in the language that we need," she said.

This month, I am joined by instructor & choreographer Laura Glaess. Laura was introduced to Lindy Hop in her small Texan hometown and helped grow the scene in San Antonio before making her way to Austin, TX, where she is now a vital part of the local scene. Her boundless energy & dedication have led her to become a highly-regarded international teacher and competitor. Laura is the co-owner of The Lindy Project in Austin and is well-known for her work choreographing performances like the Lindy Focus New Year's Eve Show and her work with the ILHC-winning team, Lindy Hopper's Dozen.
We sat down at Lindyfest 2016 to talk about learning to dance at a restrictive Catholic school, what it is like when your personal & professional identities are wrapped up in a romantic relationship, and what it's like when that ends. We also discuss learning an instrument later in life, the challenges & rewards of running a team, and making plans for a career after dancing.
You can trace the entire history of our industry by its enthusiast-generated events. The microcomputer revolution was begun by volunteer, community organizations (such as the Homebrew Computing Club at which the Apple I was initially demonstrated) and continually energized by yearly events like the Trenton Computer Fair. I've been involved in creating more than a few community-created events myself, from the Downeast Computer Fair in the late 1980s to the still-ongoing Warpstock (it outlasted my involvement). Professionally-led tech conferences have their place (a good place), but there will always be a role for the "by and for ourselves" event. That has to be true especially for the open source community and its philosophy of everybody chipping in to improve the quality of life.
And by that measure, last week's Open Source Bridge conference in Portland Oregon was a significant community success. Over 400 people attended (primarily but not exclusively from the Pacific Northwest). It was a knowledgeable crowd; 83% of them have been involved in FOSS for more than three years. One in four attendees were also presenters; notably, one in three presenters were female. Some of the speakers have names you may recognize, such as Ward Cunningham (inventor of the wiki), Sam Adams, the mayor of Portland, Sarah Sharp (author of the first USB3 driver), and Deb Bryant (from the OSU open source lab). But plenty of the people who contributed time and expertise are relatively unknown, at least outside the local area, and their sessions were just as attractive.
This wasn't a "news"-centric event, with big product releases or industry announcements. There were a few items of note, which I'll get to in a moment, but primarily everyone's attention was on sharing technical and community how-to. To some degree, members of the open source community also examined it as a social phenomenon, as in cyber-anthropologist Amber Case's analysis of how open source software spreads cyborg culture (or how, as she explained it, "humans and technology co-create each other through an actor/network of technosocial interactivity").
The conference had several tracks, from tech-centric guts to business issues to community. I'm no longer a programmer, so I left others to attend the (popular) sessions on topics like "Layers of Caching," "Five things to know about MySQL if you don't have a DBA," and "Drop ACID and think about data." Regretably that meant I had little reason to attend the well-designed "CodeIgniter as a drinking game" (Rules: Every time I demo a new CodeIgniter library, we drink. Every time I say "Can you believe how little code that took?" we drink.).
Instead, I spent most of my two days (I didn't stay for the un-conference or the Hacker Lounge) at the squishier people-centric and business-centric sessions ‚Äî and I didn't regret it for a moment. I'll share a sample of the information I acquired below, in a necessarily disjointed fashion, but I can't possibly impart it all. (I already covered two of the sessions about Starting a Business as an Open Source Consultant elsewhere.)
Portland and Vancouver Duke It Out
Let me start out with that cheerful news-ish item, announced by Mayor Sam Adams of Portland in one of the several keynote addresses. Adams, who is promoting technology as a core competency of the city of Portland, said, "City government has been a laggard in open source approaches. I'm going to do everything I can to change that." He sees open source as an opportunity to help out local community efforts particularly because "We're big spenders in digital media." For example, he said, the city is currently working on RFPs to create applications to turn city-generated data into useful and compelling data for consumers ‚Äî not just lists ‚Äî and his intent, at least, is that those applications will be open source. "There's a lot of knowledge in our data. It's just not accessible to decision makers in a way that's easily understood," he said. "That's important for the basic functions for democracy."
But Adams didn't stop with just a couple of Web apps. He threw down a gauntlet, challenging the city of Vancouver BC, which recently announced its intention to become an open-source government. "I've gotten to know their mayor," said Adams. "We're going to do everything we can ‚Äî in a very friendly competition ‚Äî to out-open-source them." Won't that be fun to watch?
Managing the Jerks
One of my favorite sessions, "Assholes are killing your project," was led by Donnie Berkholz, who learned some of his lessons the hard way in his involvement with Gentoo Linux. "This talk will teach you about the dramatic impact assholes are having on your organization today and will show you how you can begin to repair it," he promised. "The strength of your community is the best predictor of your project's long-term viability," Berkholz said. "What happens when your community is gradually infiltrated by assholes, who infect everyone else with their constant negativity and personal attacks?"
Among the issues he addressed ‚Äî with wisdom and humor ‚Äî were:
Strategies beyond banning and "don't feed the trolls"
Funneling negativity into something constructive
What we can do when we've been beset by trolls
How to help people realize they are assholes (even when the key leaders are the guilty parties)
Berkholz necessarily started by discussing the elements of community, and what makes one great or horrible. For instance, people engaging in conflict isn't inherently bad behavior; it's usually just the opposite. "When two people argue, you come up with more and better ideas," Berkholz pointed out. A new contributor should be able to suggest something and be given the same respect as someone with 10 years experience. But when one person becomes a jerk, that inhibits others' desire to talk. As professional community moderators have known for a long time, the distinction is usually when people are arguing about the ideas and not insulting the people. (There's a vast difference between "That's a dumb idea" and "You are dumb.")
But many people don't know how to argue productively, and it's safe to assume that you, oh most loyal of readers, have encountered someone with that particular character weakness.
Berkholz has two tests for whether someone is an asshole:
After talking to the person, does the target feel bad about themselves? (oppressed, humiliated, belittled)
Does the asshole target those less powerful? The first, he points out, is really the key criteria, especially when it's a pattern of behavior. We all have our bad moments, but some people are
always having a bad moment. "If you're having bad moments 90% of the time you might be an asshole," he said.
Berkholz suggests that open source projects "get in the spirit of being quanititative and using measurements to see what the impact is on your project." It's hard, he admits, but it's do-able. Look at how often an offending individual posts on a mailing list and how many people unsubscribe, for example. Do a 360-degree survey in which you ask project members how they feel after they deal with this list of people. "Try to come up with some kind of numbers," he urged, because you can't determine if you're improving unless you have some way to measure it. "We can't measure how much asshole they're being... but you can measure how much code he committed. You need a way to counter that and deal with both sides of the issue," he said.
Berkholz cited research to judge how well the good balances out the bad: Does one insult balance out one compliment? He found studies indicating that a negative interaction is five times more powerful than a positive interaction. Or, as Berkholz summarized, "Less than one sixth of your people can be assholes [for your project] to break even. To build a better community you have to beat that."
Maybe you think that your project is relatively immune, but Berkholz cautions that the jerks are still having an effect, particularly on new people. "Over time it becomes less obvious who the real problems are," he said. "You build up a tolerance." For example, he said, every active developer in the Debian community has put some people on Ignore. But new subscribers see every one of the messages from the jerks ‚Äî and those subscribers are your potential new contributors. "You need the inflow of new people who aren't being scared off."
That has especial impact on the gender balance in open source projects (and in technology overall) since, he said, when a man is attacked personally he fights back. "It turns into a battle of the wills to see who can win. Both walk away with bruises." But when a woman is attacked, in most cases she avoids the problem instead of retaliating. In collaborative communities, "avoiding" can easily translate to "walk away forever."
I probably don't need to belabor the point: Assholes are bad. How do you fix it? Among Berkholz's suggestions:
Get to know people better, with more personal interactions. An IRC channel, not just a mailing list. Have a conference.
Model what a good interaction is like. Set the community norms into a code of conduct. "It takes a long time to understand a culture when nothing is written down," he said, "like dealing with undocumented code." But do note that the assholes will find the loopholes!
You need a way to deal with people who are being assholes. The targets need a place to go to report a problem, and to get fast response. They are encouraged when they think something is going to happen. "But if nothing happens... it's even worse because now you're a hypocrite too," Berkholz added.
Remember: the mission is not "Make these assholes better people." The mission is to make this software work. Identify to the jerks what is okay to say and what's not. "Try a few times to see if you can get them to change," he said. But if they haven't learned after three times, they won't get it."
Open Source Press Relations
I had a vested interest in attending Josh Berkus' session on how open source projects should deal with the press, because I'm leading a similar session about the topic at OSCON (though from the journalist's side of the desk). Although you might associate Berkus primarily with PostgreSQL, he also organized the OpenOffice marketing project in 2001, and successfully got it plenty of coverage.
And, he stressed, no matter its size, your project needs a marketing department. Like any other area of specialization within the project, the marketing and PR efforts need their own resources, including volunteers, press contacts, reference users, a press kit, and (occasionally) just a little money. As usual, the people-resources are the most important, including translators (it's easier to get coverage in Turkey if the press release is in Turkish), writers, and designers. "PR contributions are as valuable as code. Treat it that way," said Berkus.
He emphasized the need to create a press list, separated into three categories of contacts:
Cold contacts: They get major news only, such as version releases with a major new feature.
Warm, such as people who have written previously about your project or competing ones: Tell them about major releases, as well as general significant project news.
Intimate: The people who show up at open source conferences. "You can send them anything that might be newsworthy," Berkus said.
His advice was specific and, speaking from the frequent-recipient side of the desk, very good. In a discussion on writing press releases, for instance, he pointed out that a press release is not simply a copy of your release notes. He gave a useful timetable for drafting a release (start eight weeks out, and debug the writing just as you do code, allowing 3-4 weeks to finalize a draft). He explained what "an embargoed release" is (a concept that many professional PR people fail to grasp, alas). And he compared-and-contrasted the way that amateur bloggers and professional reporters cover events. Good suggestions, all.
Making a DIY Event Work
It'd be awfully easy to focus only on what people said during the sessions at the Open Source Bridge conference, because that's the meat of what made the time useful for most participants (and, I hope, for you as a reader). But I want to devote a little space here to cheering the success of this event as a community activity, because I think it was exceedingly well done. You might want to participate in the Open Source Bridge conference next year ‚Äî yes, they've already said they'll do another in 2010 ‚Äî but if travel to Portand is not feasible (and really, I do encourage you to try; Portland is a relentlessly friendly town with great chocolate, beer, and coffee), you might want to consider rolling your own event in your own community.
One hallmark of the Open Source Bridge conference was an incredibly warm, welcoming ambiance. Strangers talked with one another... and they didn't stay strangers for long. People said Thank You ‚Äî often, and with sincerity. The underlying theme seemed to be, "How can we make this work?" so, for instance, I spoke with one attendee, currently unemployed, who'd arranged to volunteer for a certain number of hours instead of paying the event registration fee. I don't know whether to attribute this to the general Portland friendliness (not only in the FOSS community; a stranger on the street saw me looking at a map and asked if I wanted help), to the high proportion of women involved (there I go with my own gender stereotypes), or to the Portland-area in-person FOSS community (do other towns have anything approximating the Portland Open Source Software Engineers?)‚Äîbut gosh, it sure worked.
That's not to say that everything worked perfectly; few volunteer events (or commercial events) do. There might have been a little bit too much overlap in session topics (was it really necessary to have two or three sessions about making a living in open source, in addition to Kurt von Finck talking about the hacking business model?), and the exhibit hall was mostly a bunch of 8-foot folding tables with brochures, abandoned by humans most of the time. But that was okay, because when a problem came up, someone usually offered to help solve it.
And that's what community is all about, isn't it?
I had the experience of a lifetime this summer. As Delhi alternated between sweltering and stewing, I took off for my first Umrah (a pilgrimage to Mecca) with close family.
I am a practising Muslim and consider myself devout, but no number of photographs or videos of this sacred journey can prepare you for the real experience.
It was a revelation for me as I joined thousands of other devouts from across the globe circling the Kaaba, Islam's most sacred site. It is an experience in integration like no other when you walk in step with truly diverse humanity – one with millions.
I had worn an abaya to the Kaaba for the Fajr (morning prayers), but all around me were women lost in private communion with Allah, a number of them wore normal clothes, like kurtas. The Umrah has a dress code known as Ihram: Men have to wear two white sheets covering the upper and lower body, but women can wear anything modest, with their hands and faces uncovered.
In that moment of submergence, I had an epiphany as I glimpsed the faces of my fellow pilgrims, some awash in tears, others lost in silent prayers. I wondered why when we were indeed one and equal in the eyes of Allah and Holy Quran were rules so different for men and women when it came to clothes.
As an adolescent, I have toyed with the idea of wearing an abaya, but never really took to it seriously. My family left it to my judgment when it came to my clothes. And I have always felt an abaya or hijaab is often used as an instrument for the oppression of women. It is oftentimes forced on women, whereas it must be a matter of their choice.
Religion has played a very crucial role in shaping me as a person. I not only read the Quran frequently, but also take out time to pray. I also respect all other religions equally if not more. There is no sense of contradiction in this for me. But when Islam has given Muslim women the right to choose a spouse, why not give the right to dress how they like?
At a time when Muslim women's rights collectives have long been campaigning against practices like instant triple talaq and polygamy in India, I choose to write about women's right to choose what they wear. Mainly because I have always felt strongly about it.
I am a proud Muslim. Not just because I am born into the faith, but because of what I feel, as a woman, is its most liberating and progressive feature. My religion considers me at par with any man. The current discourse – both liberal and conservative – may give a different impression, but for me, the message in the Holy Quran is loud and clear.
This verse from the Holy Quran spells it out: "O you who believe! You are forbidden to inherit women against their will. Nor should you treat them with harshness, that you may take away part of the dowry you have given them - except when they have become guilty of open lewdness. On the contrary live with them on a footing of kindness and equity. If you take a dislike to them, it may be that you dislike something and Allah will bring about through it a great deal of good." [Quran 4:19]
And this is not the only verse from the Holy Quran that shines with egalitarian spirit -- Islam is all for gender equality. Why then these stringent requirements for women followers of the faith to cover up their bodies with an abaya, hijab or burkha?
I am a Muslim by birth and I am proud of it. Please do not get me wrong. The fact is, most Muslim women I know are not only very accepting of the abaya and hijab, they also believe that this is the only way to dress modestly. Most of my grandmother's generation would know no other way. They were conditioned to believe this, unquestionably, from a young age.
My argument is simple, if women are expected to adhere to certain rules, shouldn't men do the same?

Fat Bastard's revelation "I eat because I'm depressed and I'm depressed because I eat" in the Austin Powers film series may be explained by sophisticated neuroscience research being undertaken by scientists affiliated with the University of Montreal Hospital Research Centre (CR-CHUM) and the university's Faculty of Medicine. "In addition to causing obesity, rich foods can actually cause chemical reactions in the brain in a similar way to illicit drugs, ultimately leading to depression as the 'come-downs' take their toll," explain lead researcher, Dr. Stephanie Fulton. As is the case with drug addicts, a vicious cycle sets in where "food-highs" are used as a way to combat depression. "Data shows that obesity is associated with increased risk of developing depression, but we have very little understanding of the neural mechanisms and brain reward patterns that link the two," Fulton said. "We are demonstrating for the first time that the chronic consumption of palatable, high-fat diets has pro-depressive effects."
A molecule in the brain known as dopamine enables the brain to rewards us with good feelings, encouraging us to learn certain kinds of behaviour. This chemical is the same in humans as it is in mice and other animals. The research team feed mice different kinds of food and monitored how the diet affects the way the animals behave. Fulton and her colleagues use a variety of scientifically validated techniques to evaluate the relationship between rewarding mice with food and their resulting behaviour and emotions. The team is also contributing to the improvement of these techniques, such as the one demonstrated in the video. Later, the team actually looks at the brains of the mice to see how they have changed.
Mice that have been fed a higher-fat diet exhibit signs of being anxious, such as an avoidance of open areas, and of being depressed, such as making less of an effort to escape when trapped. Moreover, their brains have been physically altered by their experiences. For example, CREB is a molecule that controls the activation of genes involved in the functioning of our brains and is well known for its contribution to memory formation. CREB is much more activated in the brains of higher-fat diet mice. Finally, these mice have higher levels of corticosterone, a hormone that is associated with stress.
Fulton and her team are part of a research network that is working together to address the biological reasons for obesity and its related diseases, such as cardiovascular diseases, type 2 diabetes, some cancers, and of course depression. She is based at the Montreal Diabetes Centre, an institution associated with the CHUM and four Montreal universities that brings together facilities for clinical research, cell biology and microscopy research, and rodent physiology research, such as that involved in the depression study. "Although popular culture jokes about these illnesses and even mocks the people who are suffering, obesity is a serious and major public health issue that already affects hundreds of millions of people. As a society, we must avoid creating stigma and discriminating against obese and depressed people," Fulton said. "With regards to research, it is urgent that we identify the molecules and neural pathways involved in obesity and obesity-related illnesses. My colleagues and I are committed to identifying the brain circuitry involved in these diseases and to improving the tools available to researchers working in the same field."

Anhaedra
Anhaedra is a Dremora who can be found in the Maar Gan shrine. Bound to this plane by Lord Vivec, his eternal plight is to endure taunts from pilgrims and try to hit them while they have a powerful Sanctuary blessing on them as protection.
In order to complete the Pilgrimage to Maar Gan quests for the Temple, you must taunt him (via dialogue) into attacking you.
If you talk to Alds Baro at the Maar Gan Outpost about the latest rumors, he will tell you that Anhaedra has been unusually short-tempered lately.

Earlier this month, one of the world's most iconic buildings went public as a REIT. The Empire State Building and several smaller properties totaling 7.68 million rentable square feet were combined to form Empire State Realty Trust, Inc. The ticker is ESRT.
My purpose here today is not to examine the company's valuation, or discuss its investment potential. (I'll leave that to REIT specialists. The Empire State Building's high vacancy rate and the ongoing and expensive renovations complicate the analysis.) The REIT may be cheap, dear, or fairly valued. What I am here to discuss is how a quirk of the formation process allows investors to buy identical claims on the REIT's assets at discounts to the market price of 10% or more.
Prior to the IPO, the ownership structure of the Empire State Building and the trust's other properties was positively byzantine. Individuals, partnerships, estates, individuals and corporations all owned bits and pieces of the various properties. In order to go public, dozens and dozens of separate owners had to be convinced to vote in favor of the transaction, which would result in them contributing their stakes in return for ownership in the new structure. The process was both lengthy and litigious, but ultimately successful.
Post-IPO, the newly-formed company's ownership structure is still somewhat convoluted. All of the properties are owned by Empire State Realty OP, LP. This partnership is owned, in turn, by management, Empire State Realty Trust, Inc., and continuing investors who have received LP units in exchange for their stakes in the original ownership structures.
Here's an ownership chart, adapted from the prospectus and adjusted for the over-allotment option which was fully subscribed.
Again, Empire State Realty Trust, Inc. is the public REIT while Empire State Realty OP, L.P. is the partnership that owns all of the properties.
In simple terms, this chart shows how little of the operating partnership that the public REIT actually owns, just 39.1%. Continuing investors hold a sizable ownership stake, nearly half of the operating partnership's units.
These operating partnership units not owned by the public REIT or management present the opportunity. The partnership units consist of three different series, all of which are publicly traded.
These partnership units are economically identical to shares of Empire State Realty Trust, Inc., and will receive the same distributions. From the press release announcing the listing of the units:
“The operating partnership units are entitled to the same distributions on a per-unit basis as ESRT Class A shares. However, they are non-voting securities with significantly less trading volume than ESRT Class A shares. An operating partnership unit is exchangeable for cash or shares of Class A common stock, on a one-to-one basis, at the Company's election generally commencing on October 1, 2014.”
The only substantive difference between these operating units and shares of the REIT is voting rights, and the fact that they can be exchanged at the REIT's option. Because their economic value is identical, the prices of these operating units ought to track the prices of the REIT very closely, with perhaps a small discount for the lack of voting rights. Instead, the units are currently trading at a substantial discount to Empire State Realty Trust, Inc.'s share price.
Discounts on the operating units range from nearly 7% to nearly 15%, based on last trades. Trading in the units has been erratic, with the Series ES units changing hands at $82.00 on October 9 and 10, roughly six times the value of the the REIT's shares.
While the current discounts offered may be attractive, a larger opportunity could arise when the lockup period on these units expires. Holders of the Series ES, 60, and 250 units are currently prohibited from collectively selling more than the greatest of 1.1 million units or $40 million worth of Series ES units, and their same proportional holdings of the series 60 and 250 units. $40 million worth of Series ES units equates to 3.08 million units at the REIT IPO price of $13. There are 46.22 million Series ES units outstanding, so owners may sell 6.67% of their Series ES, 60, and 250 units are any time.
The next substantial lockup expiration comes 180 days after the IPO, when owners may sell up to 50% of their holdings. Lockup restrictions expire completely after one year. I've made a simple chart to summarize the lockup calendar.
Presently, only a little more than $60 million worth of operating units can be sold, but this amount will balloon to over $450 million at the beginning of April, 2014. If the market is suddenly flooded with units, the discounts to the REIT price may blow out.
Investors should monitor the trading prices of these operating partnership units in order to take advantage of potential market dislocations caused by motivated sellers or an influx of newly tradable units. Investors who are bullish on Empire State Realty, Inc. could simply buy whichever operating unit offers the biggest discount to the REIT, while investors who are agnostic or bearish on the REIT could easily hedge the trade by purchasing the operating partnership units and shorting the REIT shares.
I must emphasize that the operating partnership units trade at extremely low volumes, and investors should exercise caution in buying or selling.
No position, but monitoring the situation.

(You see the Blue Falcon racing by as this music plays . Suddenly, the cockpit opens, and the driver somersaults out.)
TOOP! TOOP! TOOP!
(salutes)
Hello! I am Captain Falcone, space racerman, bounty hunter, hero of the future and thrill-seeking extraordinaire! YESZ! I am a famous character of Nintendo! I am a most famous F-Zero racer, who loves to fight in the Great Fray Smash Brothers ! HUH! I am famous for my Signature Move in it, which is the...
FALCONE PAWNCH!!!
(much exploding ensues)
I began in the F-Zero game for Super Famicom ! They almost make me the flag-ship character for the console, but the plans don't pan out. But then, there are two sequels! There is the F-Zero X for Nintendo 64, which introduces very many new racers which include Black Shadow, the arch- enemy of Captain Falcone! I return in the F-Zero GX, which has a story! I compete in the Grand Prix, rescue the sexy lady Jody Summer from the accident, and defeat the evil Black Shadow and the even more powerful Deathborn to save the world from their megalomaniacal domination plans! HOOOOWAAAAAAAH!

There are two ships which I own. There is the Blue Falcone, which is the fastest machine on the circuit. But Captain Falcone is also a man of law, and I hunt the bounty of the criminals scum for justice. For this, I have the Falcone Flyer, my personal space-craft for the tracking!
There is also a clone of me, Blood Falcone! He was created by Black Shadow so that he can destroy! He wants to defeat me and become Captain Falcone, but he is not, so I go prove it with the good old-fashioned fisticuffs! There is also a clone of a different kind, who is the Demon King Ganondorf of Hyrule! He uses my moves for evil, but butchers them by doing it agonizingly slow instead of my stylish super-speed! He thinks one of the Try-Force with Power makes him invincible, but if a green elf in tights beats him all the time, then surely he will fall to Captain Falcone, an even braver hero with manly fists full of fire! YYYYEEEEAAAAAAHHHHH!!!note Ganondorf: You? Defeat me? Ha ha ha... Very funny! Quite the attitude you have there, lad.

But this is not my most famous thing! I am in the Great Fray Smash Brothers, all four times! It can show that I am an expert fighter, with very manly muscles and fighting moves! I fight all the other heroes of Nintendo as we show our moves and fight to the limit with our burning spirits of passion ! I am so tough that the Prince Krom of Ylisse is not in it because he can't even stand up to me ! Oh YESZ! But then he appears with the daughter Lucina of him (who I almost beat also) in the Project X Zone 2, so he gets his chance after all. Except that it looks like the perfect sort of game for Captain Falcone to be in, as to be a Hot-Blooded manly anime game with other manly men as the Ryunote just as in the SmaBro and also the Segata Sanshiro, so maybe I need the chance too! TOOOOOOWAAAAAAAHHHHHH!!!
And don't forget to buy the official amiibo toy figure of Captain Falcone! An action figure is most fitting for a hero of justice, but I only get it after so many years. But it is a deserving toy of very glorious ! HOOOOOWAAAAAAAHHHHH! And it also gives you a Captain Falcone of very manly power to train and fight in the Smash Brothers!
I'm in the fifth outing of Smash and in the new World of Light I join the gathering of heroes and villains going up against all-new threat. Unfortunately we lost and I'm trapped while someone has hijacked my body! Our only hope is Kirby. Go Kirby! Free everyone and put an end to Galeem!
Also please look at the time I save Christmas ! YESZ! Don't forget that there is the Game Mod for Dragon Ball Fighter Z so I can fight the cousin Vegeta of me to see who is the manliest man of the men! Of course Captain Falcone will win because my power is OVER 8-, err, 9000!!!
And remember: you don't win by being lucky, you win by being bold.
Show me ya tropes!
Five reasons why Giannis Antetokounmpo is a legit MVP candidate as the Milwaukee Bucks do-it-all-player is having a career year.
Giannis Antetokounmpo entered the NBA as a raw six-foot-nine; 18-year-old from Greece after the Milwaukee Bucks selected him 15th in the 2013 NBA Draft. He gathered the attention of NBA fans during his rookie year by flashing what he could do with his length and athleticism immediately.
Antetokounmpo, “the Greek Freak”, has gotten better each year he has been in the NBA. He earned playing time as a rookie, become a starter during his sophomore campaign, and became the Bucks best player during his third season and one of the NBA's best players in his fourth year.
He is breaking out in a big way, averaging 22.6 points, 9.1 rebounds, 5.9 assists, 2.0 blocks and 2.0 steals a night. The Greek Freak is a real star in the NBA and shouldn't fail to receive recognition just because he plays in Milwaukee or because his name is hard to pronounce.
Antetokounmpo should be an MVP candidate this season, and here are five reasons why:
5. Point Giannis
Antetokounmpo took over as the Bucks lead ball handler last spring during a late season experiment. Coach Jason Kidd turned to the Greek Freak to play point guard after Michael Carter-Williams went down and it had a surprising amount of success.
According to NBA.com, the Bucks were nearly six points per 100 possessions better with Antetokounmpo playing point guard last season than they were with Antetokounmpo on the floor with a more traditional point guard. The Bucks parted ways with Michael Carter-Williams and Kidd committed to him as his primary point guard.
Though Antetokounmpo's stats increased and the Bucks played better last year, the experiment happened during late-season basketball. The first full season was met with skeptics but thus far, this arrangement has met or exceeded expectations. Having the ball in his hands has alleviated his shooting weakness and allowed him to flourish.
Letting him be the lead ball handler gives him more opportunities to break down defenses where he has been unstoppable at getting to the rim; he leads the league in points in the paint. His ability to break down defenses has helped the Bucks increase their team three-point shooting percentage by nearly 10 percent this season as well. This is an experiment that should be here to stay.
Former House Majority Leader Tom DeLay (R-TX), who has long argued that his indictment on money laundering charges was politically motivated, said on the “Today Show” this morning that his conviction was political, too.
“I was tried in the most liberal county in the state of Texas and, indeed, in the United States,” he said, referring to Travis County, the home of Austin. DeLay and his lawyers had tried to get his trial moved to a different, more conservative county, to no avail.
“The foreman of the jury was a Greenpeace activist,” DeLay went on. “So, I'm not criticizing the jury. The point is this is a political campaign.”During the trial, DeLay told reporters he trusted the jury to acquit him, saying liberals are more empathetic. “I know them like they're my brothers and sisters,” he said.
A jury found DeLay guilty of money laundering in November. He was sentenced this week to three years in prison and 10 years' probation, but posted bail and will be free pending his appeal.
The charges stem from the 2002 statehouse elections. DeLay's state PAC collected $190,000 in corporate donations that cycle, which it donated to the RNC. The RNC, in turn, donated a total of $190,000 to seven Republican statehouse candidates hand-picked by Delay's PAC. Corporate donations for political campaigns are illegal in Texas.
DeLay's lawyer, Dick DeGuerin, also appeared on the show and revealed a bit of his appeal strategy. DeGuerin said he would use the Citizens United Supreme Court case, which legalized direct corporate donations in federal elections. But he also said that the money wasn't corporate, anyway.
Watch:
DeLay was indicted in 2005, three years after the election. The then-district attorney, Ronnie Earle, had to use multiple grand juries before he won an indictment against DeLay, which DeLay says is proof that the charges are flimsy and politically motivated.
“This was a political prosecutiion,” DeGuerin said. “He was prosecuted because he was so successful in bringing about redistricting in Texas.”
The prosecutors “made the jury hate politicians,” he said.
The seven state house candidates in 2002 won, giving Republicans the state legislature and allowing a pro-Republican redistricting orchestrated by DeLay. The redistricting, in turn, sent more Texas Republicans to the U.S. House, strengthening DeLay's power there.

Forget any other trophy in the Big Ten. Nebraska and Minnesota's $5 Bits of Broken Chair Trophy beats them all.
Devised just last season thanks to the Internet, the trophy changed hands for the first time this season as the Cornhuskers defeated the Gophers, 48-25.
To make things even weirder, the ceremonial exchange was made by the respective mascots. Now, Nebraska can take the trophy back home. But they better be careful; five dollars and bits of broken chair are hard to come by.
The Broken Chair is headed back to the great state of Nebraska! #GBR credit to @alonzomoore0765 pic.twitter.com/48fLjOHKSM — Ryan Gunderson (@TheGundy) October 17, 2015

SB Nation presents: Michigan State miracle highlights Week 7
MOUNT KISCO, N.Y. -- Several of the Giants' offensive linemen have defended and supported each other publicly this spring.
Now, the man they are paid to protect has chimed in with his vote of confidence.
Giants quarterback Eli Manning was asked Monday if his offensive line, as currently constituted, is good enough. Manning said he feels the five-man group is up to the task, throwing his support behind left tackle Ereck Flowers, left guard Justin Pugh, center Weston Richburg, right guard John Jerry and right tackle Marshall Newhouse.
"I think we have a good crew," Manning said at the 39th Guiding Eyes for the Blind Golf Classic. "They work hard, and it's important to them. We can win with them, for sure."
Richburg and Pugh turned in Pro Bowl-level seasons a year ago, so there is not much heat on them. But Flowers had a rocky rookie season, and Newhouse and Jerry have become popular targets of criticism amongst fans.
Richburg and Pugh have gone to bat for the right side of the line, offering vigorous defenses of both players and Flowers during the offseason program. And Newhouse and Jerry have taken the outside negativity in stride, while expressing appreciation for their linemates' support.
Manning said when it comes to an offensive line, cohesion is the most important thing.
"I've always thought of the offensive line, it's not always five individual players," he said. "You have to look at them as a group, and how well they communicate, how well they get along, and understand the schemes, and handle whatever is thrown at them. The longer you have the same five together, you can grow and get better together."
Post-OTA thoughts and notes
Offensive continuity is one of the reasons the Giants are optimistic they can end their four-year playoff drought this fall. In addition to Manning and the five projected offensive linemen, the team also expects to have wideout Odell Beckham Jr., running back Rashad Jennings, and tight ends Larry Donnell and Will Tye, both of whom started last year, back in the fold.
Throw in the potential for a Victor Cruz return and rookie wideout Sterling Shepard, and the Giants should more or less look the same as they did a year ago. And, they'll take that.
Despite their 6-10 finish, the Giants had the NFL's No. 8-ranked offense a year ago in yards-per-game, and were sixth in points-per-game. And, despite all the criticism, the offensive line was fifth-best in sacks allowed per pass attempt, although some of that was on Manning's propensity to get rid of the ball quickly.
It was not good enough, per se, when examining the big picture. But Manning feels the offense's success last year gives the Giants a good foundation to build upon in 2016, their third year in now-head coach Ben McAdoo's scheme.
"I think we did some good thing last year. We were able to move the ball and score points," Manning said. "I think it's good when you have a lot of the same guys back. That means guys understand what we're trying to do, what we need to do, what we need to do better, and you can grow with those guys."

Are you still talking about last week's season finale of Parks & Recreation? Because the Internet is.
From jumping into the future three years to meeting Michelle OMG Obama, the episode was epic. Frankly, it felt more like a series finale then a season finale.
I spoke with Parks & Rec's Jim O'Heir, who plays Terry, or Jerry -- no, Terry -- I can't keep up. Anyway, we chatted about the season finale, spoilers coming up next season, and what Chris Pratt looks like naked (I asked for pics, still waiting for them).
It felt a lot like a series finale. Why?
Yeah, it really could have been a series finale. People are saying that's because we were on the bubble of not getting renewed, but that's not the case. We found out in January that we were coming back. This is the direction they wanted to go, this is where they want to begin next season. It's going to be three years later, and I think it opens up so many possibilities.
Like Leslie, Amy Poehler's character, having triplets.
What that does be gets us away from the whole baby thing. There will not be a pregnant lady walking around. We've had two pregnancies already in the last year, that's plenty. Now they're just 3-year-old people, and you can keep them around as much or as little as you want. I love the jump, and I think Amy in particular was like, I'm not doing the babies, I'm already doing that in my own life.
It's like a better written version of when Desperate Housewives jumped into the future.
I was telling people all along that there's something happening in the last minute of the episode that's gonna be shocking. I don't think it's ever been done on a sitcom, but I was careful to point out that it had been done on a dramedy before. We're going to stick to three years later, but maybe there will be flashbacks or references to what's happened in the past three years. I love people's reactions to it, they were shocked.
What's going on for Jerry now?
If you do the math, Jerry is now 70. Myself, Jim O'Heir, as a man, as a person, is 52. So already there are some issues there. Three years ago they gave me my 16th birthday party for my leap year birthday, which made me 64. So now, six years from then, I'm 70. It's working, apparently. I'm still there, I'm still dropping things. Jerry dreams of being in a cabin with his wife. I literally have no idea. The writers' theory when they do a season finale is to throw everything at it and say, "We'll work it out in the hiatus." Literally, all that crazy stuff from the last 30 seconds, from Leslie walking in yelling, "It's a press lockdown," Ben in a tux, nobody knows what any of this means.
What's a day on the set like?
We do laugh all day. The atmosphere is unlike any other show I've ever done. Everybody is friendly and happy. The work gets done, but they let us play. We're creative people, and by letting us play, creative things come out of that. Around 80 percent of the crew are the same from day one, and that tells you what kind of set it is. People don't want to leave. Once we shoot one scene and everyone is happy with it, then we should a fun run, which is anything goes. By anything I mean there have been wigs thrown off, Chris Pratt was naked once...
Wait, I'm going to have to interrupt you there to ask a very important question: What was it like to see Chris Pratt naked?
I guess it was okay? That was many seasons ago when he did the naked thing.
But it was like yesterday in your heart, right?
I think it was pre-buff Pratt.
Really? Moving on. Parks & Rec has had some amazing guest stars. Tell me about Michelle Obama.
The only actors that met the first lady were Amy and Brady Smith, the actor she shared the scene with. Imagine being a guest star and being told, "Listen, we're going to fly you to Miami, we can't tell you why, but you're going to do this special scene there, with Amy, and somebody else." Then you find out it's Michelle Obama. Amy flew to Miami because that's where Michelle Obama was.
And you go wherever Michelle Obama tells you to go.
The Obamas are big fans of the show because it's their daughters favorite show. We've known that for a couple of years.
You've also had Uncle Joe Biden on the show.
If you were to meet him, would you call him Uncle Joe?
Yes. I would hug him and let him hold me in a Catholic grandpa kind of way.
The fact that the Catholic part came into that says a lot about you. How long have you been in therapy?
A long time. You're in Adam Carolla's movie, Road Hard, which was crowdfunded and raised $1.4 million. Tell me about the film.
The script is really sweet; it's got a lot of heart to it, and it's Carolla so it's got a lot of laughs. He's a former sitcom guy who had huge success but lost it. Now he's on the road doing comedy trying to maintain a certain lifestyle, so there's money issues, family issues. But it's a really sweet film. I play an owner of one of the places he goes to do stand-up.
Knowing Carolla's stated disinterest in female comedians, I have to ask, were there any female comics on set?
There are female comics in the film; there's even a very well-known one, but I can't say who.
What's next for you?
Besides Carolla's film, I'm doing a film in Chicago called Mind Over Mindy, Park & Rec is going to Comic-Con, we're going to a Nantucket Comedy Festival.
Last question, and it's the most important question that can be asked in 2014: Will you follow me on Twitter?
Hell yes!
Cats are extraordinary creatures and many of us make the mistake of thinking they are like dogs when it comes to owning them as pets. Cats have instincts that cause them to be the way they are and do the things they do. While dogs are trainable in most cases this is not so much the case with cats. They cannot have specific traits trained out of them. From the time they are born they are taught by their mother how important it is to hunt and feed their young. Even cats that have been hand fed and raised by humans for their whole lives will still carry the hunters instinct because it has been bred into them since the beginning of their existence. However, knowing these things does not help to prepare us for the dead animals cats often bring to us as gifts. The good news is that understanding why they do it may help you to react a bit differently to them when they do.
Thank You for Feeding Me
Perhaps when cats go to the trouble of going out and hunting for prey and then bringing it to your feet they are attempting to feed you in the same way that mother cats feed their kittens. Could this be a gesture of thanks or reciprocity for the many times you feed him? The truth is no one really knows if this is one of the reasons that cats tend to bring us dead animals but one thing is for sure, they do it in such a way that appears to be a distinct gesture of giving. For example, your cat may actually drag something he has killed through the pet door and go to the trouble of putting it on your pillow. When you walk in the room you see your cat sitting there watching you intensely as you find your little present. The cat is watching to make sure you have received his gift. You will undoubtedly have a reaction for the cat to see but it will probably not be at all what he may have expected.
I am a Great Hunter!
Your cat may also be trying to show off his keen ability to hunt. He wants you to see how great he is at what he does so he struts in with something he has killed and brings it right to your feet. This is very close to the way a child acts when he/she has done something great and wants you to notice. It may even be that your cat thinks you need a brush up course in hunting, so he is trying to teach you as his mother taught him. Your cat has no way of reasoning the fact that you, unlike him, do not have to hunt in order to eat. Of course your cat probably doesn't have to hunt to eat either but try making him understand that.
You Are My Kitten and I Love You
Maybe your cat believes that you are her people and that it is her job to take care of you. This is especially true if you have a female cat. Female cats have very strong maternal instincts and so it stands to reason that anyone the cat feels close to would be considered someone she wants to feed. She sees you as a kitten or child that she should care for. This prompts her to go out and hunt for gifts for you so that you can enjoy the same food she is enjoying. You really do not want to hurt her feelings by jumping and running in horror but at the same time you certainly are not going to eat what she has brought home, unless of course you enjoy eating mice and tree lizards. A better thing to do would be to act happy that she brought you the gift and then toss it the moment she turns her head (yuck!).
You Cannot Make Your Cat Stop Hunting
No amount of squirts from a spray bottle or other cat training methods are going to stop your cat from doing what he/she does best. Your cat is a hunter and as mentioned earlier will continue to hunt no matter what you do. Even cats that are kept indoors exclusively will find small creatures to kill and bring you. In addition, a cat does not have to hunt for a real animal, it could easily be a toy that your cat kills and spreads across your blankets on your bed. The thing to remember is that you do not want to react negatively when your cat brings in something dead, no matter how tempted you are. Your cat is not doing these things to be bad; in fact he/she is doing it for quite the opposite reason, to do something good.
You may not be able to stop your cat from bringing dead creatures in but you may be able to designate an area for him/her to bring the “treats” and leave them. Maybe you can react in a way that mimics joy and then move the gift to another area like on the front porch. If you do this often enough maybe your cat will learn that the front porch is the right place to leave gifts. Whatever the case try and remind yourself that you cat is bringing you their hunted prey as a gift of love and appreciation not to be a pest or annoyance.
The Baltimore Orioles got good news on injured closer Zach Britton on Monday.
A second opinion given by Dr. Neal ElAttrache in California confirmed the earlier diagnosis of a strained muscle in the forearm of the left-handed reliever and did not reveal any damage to his elbow ligaments, a source told ESPN's Eddie Matz, confirming an earlier report by BaltimoreBaseball.com.
Britton is on the disabled list for the second time this season with the injury and, according to multiple reports Tuesday, the Orioles hope he can rejoin them before the All-Star break.

Britton appeared in just two games between DL stints and says his attempt to come back sooner than he should've contributed to the reappearance of the injury.
"The doctors and the trainers wanted me to be a little more cautious with it at the time, maybe take another week," Britton said Saturday. "I was kind of over sitting on the bench watching games and felt I was in a good enough position to come back. Obviously, I wasn't."
The 29-year-old has a 1.00 ERA and is 5-for-5 in save opportunities this season. He has converted 54 consecutive save opportunities.

Between its 1984 and 1985 seasons, Saturday Night Live went through well known major changes when creator Lorne Michaels returned to the show, replacing producer Dick Ebersol. What few remember is that Ebersolâ€™s tenure had been cut short by three episodes thanks to the 1981 writersâ€™ strike, and he was still under contract to deliver those shows.
The solution: an experiment in Summer 1985 saw three more SNLs produced, with the option for a recurring summer spot if they were successful. Instead, these three episodes would never air again.
Ebersol: â€œThe â€™84 cast, we couldnâ€™t afford to keep them for the summer. I was in talks with Billy Crystal about taking over the show, but James Belushi was hot to stay on. He said he had big ideas, and he was, certainly he was part of the SNL family, so we ran with it.â€
Alex Karras
Belushiâ€™s first move was to bring one of the hosts of the previous season, retired pro football player Alex Karras, back as a full cast member and show writer.
Ebersol: â€œAlex really took to James and the show, so Jim was adamant about bringing him into this cast. Webster was a hit for ABC, so we felt like we were getting one over on them.â€
Belushi: â€œWith Karras, I mean, Blazing Saddles? Itâ€™s a given, if you can get an Alex Karras on your show, you make this happen. And he got it. Great guy, best cast member I ever worked with. Iâ€™d put him up there with John and Billy Murray. â€
Crystal: â€œBelushi and Karras did the White Guy Rap sketch when Alex hosted, and Jim was convinced this was going to be a thing, that it was going to take off, maybe be his Blues Brothers. They did three episodes that summer, and they did the White Guy Rap seven times.â€
Herb Sargent (Writer): â€œWhat I remember most about working on those episodes was The Karras Rule that Belushi instituted. The Karras Rule was, Jim was head writer, but anybody who disagreed with an idea he had, they got to overrule him as long as Alex Karras couldnâ€™t bench press them. And he was, god he was retired for over a decade, but he was so strong. So, so strong.â€
Ellen Foley
Singer and actress Ellen Foley, who had a starring role on Night Court the previous season, joined the cast as its lone female member.
Ebersol: â€œEllen was a perfect fit for the show. She came from in-house on NBC, and she did that Meat Loaf number with Phil Rizzuto, so, yes, to get a singer on the show, too, it just made sense.â€
Larry David: â€œJulia [Louis-Dreyfus] was going to stay on for those episodes, but it was the summer of New Coke, and they had this weird â€˜Nude Cokeâ€™ sketch that she didnâ€™t want to do, so she walked out.â€
Dave Wilson (Director): â€œBelushi had been watching a lot of Night Court because he wanted Richard Moll to come onto SNL very badly. I never understood it at the time, how they were really fixated on making this â€˜biggest cast everâ€™ in terms of size. I guess it made a lot more sense after that XTC thing that happened.â€
Ebersol: â€œI donâ€™t know how it started, but a rumor spread around that Night Court was going to be canceled, so after that, it was easy to get her to come over. Itâ€™s a shame for her, I suppose, it went on to crack the Top 10 in â€™86.â€
Vincent Schiavelli
Veteran character actor Vincent Schiavelli, who had appeared in both the film and television versions of Fast Times at Ridgemont High, was added next.
Ebersol: â€œJames pushed hard for us to bring Vince on board, and this was before those Dorf golf videos. I remember James running into my office with a headshot of Vince, and he just kept saying â€˜Look at this guy, Dick! Just look at him! Get a load of this guy!â€™ It was a no-brainer, with that kind of enthusiasm.â€
Wilson: â€œJim and Alex assigned Vince to do what was still Saturday Night News, because they figured he read the papers. He took it as an honor, and was really moved by the whole thing. A few hours later, they thought it would be funny to barricade him in his office. He was trapped in there for a day and half before facilities got him out.â€
Reuven Frank, (President, NBC News, 1981-1985): â€œIt was the damndest thing. The lone News segment Schiavelli did was right after the Soviets named Gorbachev General Secretary. And he called it. He called it all: perestroika, glasnost, the whole thing. Just uncanny, stunningly accurate in hindsight.â€
Dennis Miller: â€œPat Swayze hosts about five years later promoting Ghost, and he asks about Vinnie Schiavelli being on the show. Swayze said Vince told him that he based that subway ghost deal on what it felt like being on SNL with Al Karras and Jimmy Belushi.â€
Kevin Peter Hall
A prime time press conferences was held to announce the hiring of 7â€™4â€ tall actor Kevin Peter Hall, who would later become famous for playing the title role in Predator.
Ebersol: â€œJames and Alex had it in their heads that we could make a big deal out of, with this seven foot tall fellow, signing someone who would be the Tallest Cast Member in SNL history. He still holds the record, which, thatâ€™s impressive.â€
Brandon Tartikoff: â€œEveryone was convinced that being tall was the next big movement in comedy. And so NBC signed Kevin to a three-year exclusive contract to be our next big star, and when the summer SNL flopped, we put Misfits of Science together around him in about a month, because of this multi-million dollar contract with the network.â€
Wilson: â€œThe first episode, his head was out of frame in a lot of the shots, because you could see the top of the set if he was standing. Still, Kevin did a surprisingly good Desmond Tutu impression. But Alex liked writing for him, so mostly he was just called on to play Ed â€œToo Tallâ€ Jones and Bubba Smith in a lot of sketches.â€
Josh Mostel
Actor Josh Mostel was brought onto the show after playing Blutoâ€™s brother Blotto in Delta House, the TV version of Animal House.
Belushi: â€œAs good as my years were, I knew something was missing. Nobody ever brought this up, but where was the big, funny guy in my cast? All the best years, you have that loud, doughy guy, but where was that guy in â€™84-â€™85? Nowhere, man. So I went and got one.â€
Karras: â€œThat guy cracked me up. Jim and I, we had this sketch that would be like those old samurai bits, only Mostel would be a sumo wrestler and he was in this giant diaper every week. I still laugh, just thinking about it.â€
Wilson: â€œThey showed him the sumo costume, you could tell Josh wasnâ€™t happy. But Karras had â€“ and I donâ€™t even know why he had it, it was the middle of summer â€“ he had one of those ski poles, that you ski with? And heâ€™s horsing around with it and one thing leads to another and it gets thrown across the room and stuck into the wall about a foot from Mostelâ€™s head. So the Sumo Wrestler sketch went on that week.â€
Episode 1: Eric Stoltz/Dukes of Stratosphear
After receiving word in 1984 that Back To The Future was poised to become a major hit the following year, SNL locked up star Eric Stoltz to kick off its summer launch. Unfortunately, Stoltz was replaced during filming by upcoming NBC star Michael J. Fox. The show was still contractually obligated to have Stoltz host that season, but by the time his episode aired, their host was now promoting the 1985 film Mask. The musical guest was the band XTC under their short-lived Dukes of Stratosphear psychedelic pseudonym.
Ebersol: â€œWe kept putting that one off, when [Stoltz] left Future. And they had a sketch about Mask, but it was a littleâ€¦Iâ€™ve never seen the dress rehearsal audience turn on a sketch like that. They were livid, ready to rush the stage. So instead, most of the sketches that aired that night were about Back To The Future anyway. I heard later that Eric went home and threw out his TV instead of showing up for the after party.â€
Wilson: â€œBack in â€˜81, John [Belushi] pushed to have the band Fear on and they almost started the riot. That stuck with Jim, he thought it sullied the family reputation. And he apparently had this elaborate idea where he would invite Fear back on for a make-good session, and the plan was that he and Alex Karras and Kevin Peter Hall would jump Fear on live TV, to get revenge for making John look bad.â€
Ebersol: â€œKevin really wanted no part of this, he didnâ€™t know who Fear were and he had no interest in fighting anyone, so thankfully, he relayed this plan, and we were able to call it off and got a replacement act. But I guess James never told Alex, or maybe the band names confused him?â€
G.E. Smith: â€œAndy Partridge stopped performing a few years before because of stress and stage fright, but he felt like he could do a show if he did it in his Sir John Johns character? But about a minute into â€œ25 Oâ€™Clockâ€, Karras hit the stage and just pummeled the whole band. He tossed Dave Gregory right through their mellotron. It was a scene.â€
Episode 2: Orson Welles/USA For Africa
This episode holds the distinction for shortest SNL installment, ending 20 minutes earlier than planned when host Orson Welles fell asleep on air. Sketch highlights included Sumo Wrestler CafÃ©, Citizen Kane Winter Olympics and White Guy Rap.
Ebersol: â€œThe great Orson Welles, he was game for anything, what a trooper! The only conflict he had with the cast and crew all week was over how they were pronouncing a few Japanese words. He really let Josh Mostel have it.â€
Karras: â€œHaving been in films, working with Orson Welles was amazing. He was really out of it by then, so heâ€™d do pretty much anything you wanted if you told him Merv Griffin said it was funny. So to get this guy, this famous director, to get him in that sumo wrestler outfit, that was hilarious. I donâ€™t even know if he was promoting anything.â€
G.E. Smith: â€œDan Aykroyd helped book USA For Africa, and we knew we couldnâ€™t get everybody, so obviously Michael wouldnâ€™t be on, or Bruce, Dylan, Ray, Willie, Lionel, those guys. We hoped Paul Simon or Stevie Wonder might show, but that fell through. Daryl [Hall] made it, but not John [Oates], which was kind of weird. I think Billy Joel showed up to rehearse once but we never saw him again. But, Daryl, Cindy Lauper, Steve Porcaro, Randy and Marlon Jackson and Dan Aykroyd, still kind of a big deal.â€
Episode 3: Patrick Ewing/Magic Dick of J. Geils Band
In a coup, SNL landed future NBA Hall of Famer Patrick Ewing as a host a mere four days after he was drafted #1 overall by the New York Knicks.Â Sketches included Too Talk With Ed ‘Too Tall' Jones, a Dallas sketch with Patrick Ewing as JR and three installments of White Guy Rap.
Ebersol: â€œGetting Patrick right after the draft was very exciting for everyone, a chance to get some positive momentum going. This was our best episode that summer by far, but I guess it was too little, too late.â€
G.E. Smith: â€œA few months earlier, Peter Wolf was the musical guest right after J. Geils Band broke-up, and to make it up to the rest of the band, they were all going to be on for our summer show. I guess they were still angry about Peter being on first, so at showtime, the only member of the band who came was Magic Dick. But he still played, he did Centerfold twice, on just the harmonica. And Belushi was thrilled.â€
Belushi: â€œOh, that was great! He was the best one anyway. We should have had him back to do some Blues Brothers stuff.â€
Michaels: â€œAfter the XTC beatings and the 20 minutes of dead air on the Orson Welles debacle, I knew that coming back was was the only way to salvage the show's legacy. And these episodes, these are not, they do not count. I will say, the credits for that summer, they were very nice. We kept those when we came back. So, not a total loss, no.â€

Nearly 70 per cent of Australians believe the minimum wage is too low, including a strong majority of Coalition voters, a new poll has found.
Only one in five Australians believe the $17.70 an hour minimum wage is "about right" and just four per cent of people think it is too high, according to the polling commissioned by the peak union body, the ACTU.
Conducted last week, the Essential Research online poll of 1015 people found 69 per cent of Australians want a higher minimum wage, with 33 per cent of those respondents saying it should be "much higher". Nearly 60 per cent of Liberal National voters believe it should be higher, as do 77 per cent of Labor voters.
The ACTU has asked the workplace relations umpire to raise the minimum wage by $45 a week, triple the 2016 $15.80 increase. Such an increase would lift the minimum wage to $37,420 a year.

When Asma P. started Haute Muslimah in 2009, she was one of the only bloggers in the U.S. writing about modest fashion. “I was interested in runway trends, and writing about creating a modest look out of those outfits," says the Austin-based mother of two, who prefers to keep her identity partially under wraps. Today, there are dozens of bloggers writing about modest fashion in the U.S., from Days of Chandler — written by Utah-based Mormon Chandler Roberson — to Fabologie, New York-based stylist Adi Heyman's site geared toward Orthodox Jewish women.

But it's not just an increase in the number of bloggers who are writing about modest fashion that has changed: Asma has seen shifts in the attitudes of brands as well. When DKNY launched its Ramadan collection in July 2014, Haute Muslimah had one of its best traffic days ever. Asma's post on the announcement generated more than 100,000 page views — around the same number she usually receives in one month. Over the years, she has noticed other brands catering to the modest-fashion community. Chanel, for instance, hosted its 2015 resort show in Dubai. Valentino's floor-length, covered-up silhouettes are a big hit with her audience. And she has closely tracked the development of halal nail polishes, something that was unheard of before 2013. “I do see a change,” she says. “The designers care more now than they used to.”

Asma's experience may be mostly anecdotal, but it speaks to the increasing influence minority bloggers have on the fashion industry. For instance, look at what the plus-size blogging community has accomplished in the past year. GarnerStyle blogger Chastity Garner's open letter to Target, scolding the big-box retailer for leaving plus sizes out of its designer collections, not only spurred the store to add plus-size styles to its upcoming collection with Lilly Pulitzer, it also helped nudge along the launch of Ava & Viv, a full-fledged plus-size fashion line. (Garner and fellow bloggers Nicolette Mason and Gabi Gregg modeled for the first lookbook, and also consulted on social media strategy for the February launch.) Mason, in particular, has developed a reputation for promoting diversity in the industry. She speaks openly about race — she is half-Persian — sexuality, and yes, body image.
Fashion blogging, despite its reputation for over-Photoshopped Instagrams posted by wannabe models with heads full of hot air, has also forced the industry to recognize groups of women that have been ignored in the past. When we criticize the fashion industry, we often talk about how we can't see ourselves on the pages of magazines, or even on the racks at the store. We complain about how the industry dictates beauty standards that are unachievable for the majority of the population. But while there are bloggers who perpetuate those stereotypes, there are also many popular ones who don't. And they are the ones moving the needle.
The numbers tell a promising, if still cautionary, story. Fashionista's 2015 ranking of the world's 20 most powerful bloggers includes 10 that represent at least one minority group. Blogger database Fohr Card reports that 31 percent of its top 100 influencers are Asian, Hispanic or black. In the past three months, over 30 percent of the media spend on Fohr Card has been focused on these communities. “I think the reason [minority] influencers do so well is that traditional fashion outlets ignored them for years,” says Fohr Card founder James Nord. “Brands are finally waking up to the importance of speaking to that side of their consumer base. Oftentimes, the best way to do that is by working with an influencer.”
Brands are not shy about looking for bloggers that represent a specific niche. “In the last few days alone, I've had two different beauty brands specifically ask what Hispanic talent I work with because they want to target that demo for their upcoming campaigns,” says Vanessa Flaherty, vice president of the management division at blogger agency Digital Brand Architects. “Another nail care brand is coming out with range of polish that fits different skin tones, so we matched our diverse range of talent with them.”
Mass and luxury labels are making an effort to diversify because of the clear financial upside. The buying power of Hispanic Americans equalled $1.3 trillion in 2014. African Americans: $1.1 trillion. Asian Americans: $770 billion. (That's all according to the Multicultural Economy Report, a study released in September 2014 by the Selig Center for Economic Growth at the University of Georgia Terry College of Business.)
But there is also no denying that much of the fashion industry is still lagging behind. On the fall 2015 runways, 80 percent of the models were white, according to a report compiled by The Fashion Spot. And in 2014, only 119 out of 868 magazines covers featured a minority.
Chriselle Lim, the blogger behind The Chriselle Factor, believes that the industry is moving in the right direction, however. “I do think the industry has changed in the past 10 years,” says the Los Angeles-based Lim, who began her career in editorial before breaking out on her own in 2010. “When I started, it was so rare to see an Asian face on a campaign or even on the runway. I think that social media, and just digital media in general, has really given a voice to minorities.” Lim, who is a first-generation Korean American, says that she has received many reader comments and personal emails over the years, thanking her for inspiring them to work in fashion. “For Asian Americans who are first generation, so many of our parents have wanted us to pursue work outside of the arts,” Lim says. “It's great to inspire other people to make careers out of it.”
Indeed, while the industry still has a long way to go, these anti-cookie-cutter fashion bloggers have already succeeded in offering a place for their audiences to connect with someone who is reflective of their own backgrounds. "I've had so many readers email me to say that they're so happy that I keep my hair curly,” says French-American biracial actress Christina Caradona, the blogger behind Trop Rouge. “There are still a lot of bloggers who fit that blonde hair, blue eye stereotype. But there are plenty who don't. It has opened up a lot.”
The third and historic final presidential debate looks to have done better than Debate 2, scoring an early overnight 39.7 household rating. Debate 2, which battled NFL on NBC, had bagged an early household 37.2/52 – a nearly 20% drop from the first debate's overnight household 46.2 rating.
Among those networks Donald Trump claims are rigged against him, NBC and ABC led the pack, ratings-wise in the early derby, with a 6.6/10 in Nielsen's 56 metered markets for this election cycle's third and final presidential debate. Fox News Channel, whose Chris Wallace moderated, marking a first for that 20-year-old network, nipped at their heels with a 6.5/9. CBS followed at 6.1/9, ahead of CNN's 5.6/8.
Fox broadcast network also was in the game, clocking a 4.6/7 for its broadcast from from the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. That's ahead of MSNBC's 3.6/5.
Last night's debate made headlines and history, marking the first time a candidate from a major political party has said on stage that he might not accept election results on November 8. The reality TV star- turned-candidate said so, when asked by Wallace, explaining he wants there to be a cliffhanger. No word whether Donald Trump intends to accept these early ratings results.
He did, however, once again cite unscientific polls to tweet this morning that he'd won the debate, though pundits last night said otherwise:

The most-watched third debate in televised debate history was the October 19, 1992 debate. It featured Billy Bush's uncle, George H.W. Bush, and Hillary Clinton's husband, Bill Clinton. It also featured Ross Perot, and averaged 66.9M viewers across ABC, CBS, NBC and CNN. In this election cycle, Debate 1 clocked a record 84M viewers, and Debate 2 66.5M
Our creativity may vary in style, but never in quality.

Opinions expressed by Entrepreneur contributors are their own.
I like to believe that we are all born creative. Our creativity may vary in style, but never in quality. And while you might have lost touch with your idea-generating department, you can always reach it again.
Here are 10 tips on how to start producing ideas on a daily basis.
1. Start an idea notebook.
Always carry a notebook and write down everything. An idea is like bait, once you get a glimpse of one, you use it to catch bigger and better ideas. Write down everything that you think might be a starting point.
Related: The 4 Daily Mistakes Killing Your Creativity
2. Hold intense brainstorming sessions.
Here is when you go fishing. Let your mind wonder and go from one idea to the other. Brainstorming sessions will get your mind into creative mode.
3. Write 10 new ideas every night.
Think of this as a plan for tomorrow. Write down ideas before you go to sleep and wake up the next day with the basis for your work. It will give you direction and can prevent a creative block. I do this every night. It's easy to come up with the first six, and the last four take a little extra brain power. Try it.
4. Draw ideas.
Let your hand scribble on the paper and your mind will wonder. Try expressing your ideas into drawings and sketches. And remember, you don't have to be an actual artist to get the most of the benefits picture has to offer. It's fun. I like to draw out websites I build.
5. Seek experiences.
Lead an experience-driven life. Experiencing new things will widen your perspective and will give you a bigger "inspiration pool." People with full lives are better at being open, creative and producing new ideas.

6. Turn off your electronics.
Get away from the computer. Even when brainstorming or taking notes, use good old pen and paper. Turn off your electronics and remove your mind from distractions. You will find that not only you are more awake, but you will be better at directing your attention and maximizing the production of new ideas.
7. Drink coffee.
Coffee wakes up the brain and sparks creativity. Think of it as fuel for your idea generator. Combine it with any of the previous tips, and you'll feel limitless. I only drink caffeine a couple times per month, so when I drink it, it has a profound effect on me to the point I feel like I can walk through walls and see into the future.
8. Surround yourself with creatives.
Hang out with creative people, those who can inspire you and give you feedback. Network and bounce off ideas with each other. Get inspiration from people in your social group, and then expand your social group. And if the idea calls for it, by all means, collaborate.
9. Finish things.
Get in the mode of finishing things. Once you start thinking of an idea, think it through and don't abandon it. Feeling accomplished will provide a dopamine boost, and help establish a craving that in turn develops a habit. Yay, habit loop!

10. Don't put yourself down.
Never think that you are not creative enough or don't have what it takes. Creative is a mood, not a brain type. Give yourself a break if things don't come as naturally in the beginning and take it light. Rather than forcing it, create a habit of producing ideas and realize that habits take time.
Whether you need it for your job or want to lead a more creative life, transforming your brain into an idea-generating factory can be life-changing on all levels.
Word of caution: create ideas at your own risk, the effects could be a more focused, enriched, creative way of living. You may find more time and joy in the things you already do, and discover newfound opportunities and experiences. Not everyone will be ready for the profound effects. So "idea" wisely.
The open connecting layout makes the whole interior merge into one where the materials are carried through to the next room to capture a sense of continuity amongst these very different rooms. An example is the raw concrete steps carried through inside the warm comfort spaces.
Another element that is cleverly repeated in most of the residence's areas is the furniture. In particular, the well known Catifa chair from Arper is seen throughout the indoors. With different upholsteries and the variety in its frame, this feature indicates how continuity can exist through change. Of course both architects have a strong love forArper pieces and the Catifa model is definitely one of the examples why this love is so strong. Being extremely comfortable, this design can be incorporated to compliment opposite style type interiors. Classic yet Contemporary.
And it is this same ideology that makes this residence so appealing and adaptable to all tastes and lifestyle choices.

It's from a Norse myth.Mistletoe was said to be the sacred plant of Frigga, the goddess of love. When her son, Balder, dreamed of his death, Frigga rushed about seeking promises that her son would not die. Unfortunately, Balder's enemy, Loki, tipped an arrow with Mistletoe and gave it to Hoder, the blind god of winter who killed Balder with it. He was brought back to life by his mother when she shed tears that turned into Mistletoe berries, so Frigga kissed everyone who passed under the tree on which it grew. From that time on, anyone who stood under the mistletoe would receive only a kiss; no harm could come to him.An Anglo-Saxon legend of Freya, goddess of love, said men must kiss any young girl who stood under a sprig of Mistletoe hung from the ceiling. Another custom required all the Mistletoe in the house to be burned on Twelfth Night, or the couples who kissed under it will never marry.

Since 2008, the story of American politics has been the Republican Party's long, vicious struggle to regain power and cling onto it by whatever means necessary.
The Tea Party wave election in 2010 brought a new legion of far-right ideologues into Congress. That same year, Republicans won control of statehouses across the country, which gave them the ability to redraw electoral maps in the wake of the census. Around the same time, Republicans began passing new laws that make it even harder for poor people, young people, and people of color to vote. And they expanded a decades-long war on unions, traditionally a wellspring of Democratic support and cash.
DC gridlock soon became normalized as once-fringe conservatives consolidated control of the Republican Party. In 2013, right-wing elements of the GOP briefly shut down the government because they objected to funding for the Affordable Care Act (ACA). That same year, House conservatives launched an ultimately successful campaign to derail immigration reform—again.
In the Senate, Mitch McConnell, then the minority leader, did everything he could to block Democratic bills. After the Republicans retook the Senate in 2014, McConnell became majority leader. That helped him engineered his most audacious act of blockage ever, when he refused to even hold hearings on Barack Obama's pick to replace Antonin Scalia on the Supreme Court. That shockingly partisan gambit paid off—like a lot of Republican gambles—when Donald Trump successfully nominated Neil Gorsuch to the court after winning the presidency.
So how are Republicans choosing to exercise this power they've spent so much time and effort acquiring? What are the ends that make their means necessary? With the unveiling of the Senate's version of healthcare reform on Thursday, America got reminder of their overriding goals: Cut taxes for the rich, and make life as miserable as possible for poor people.
There's a little more to it than that, of course (the bill would also defund Planned Parenthood for a year), but really that's what this boils down to. Arguably the most important part of Obama's signature healthcare law was Medicaid expansion, which gave millions of people (most of them poor) access to insurance and healthcare and may have even improved the economy. "National, multi-state, and single state studies show that states expanding Medicaid under the ACA have realized budget savings, revenue gains, and overall economic growth," wrote the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation in a February assessment of studies on the subject.
The new Senate bill, like the bill the House passed last month, would roll back that Medicaid expansion, though the Senate version would do so more slowly, spreading the cuts out between 2021 and 2024. Both versions would also place new funding restrictions on Medicaid, forcing states to make hard choices about cutting services or raising taxes—or both. According to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO), the House bill's changes to Medicaid alone would lead to 14 million fewer people having insurance by 2026. (The CBO has yet to score the Senate version.)
The savings generated by taking away insurance from the poor, disabled, and addicted will be mostly eaten up by a variety of tax breaks for the rich.

Healthcare reform is the only piece of major legislation the Republican Congress has considered so far. This is telling. Lawmakers could have tried to tackle tax reform, or they could have followed Trump's lead and pushed for infrastructure spending, which was previously opposed by conservatives but is broadly popular across America. They could have even considered passing laws related to immigration or abortion, issues that remain very important to the Republican base.
Instead they chose to take on healthcare, rushing through a shockingly unpopular bill with the minimum possible amount of debate. Even by the low standards of the 21st century, this has been a cynical process. Republicans have complained about high insurance premiums under the Affordable Care Act, but their bill will only lower premiums by making insurance less generous.
Meanwhile, Trump doesn't seem to know or care about the bill he has endorsed repeatedly and in public; the healthcare reform he's been the most vocal about, letting insurers sell across state lines, isn't in either version of the bill. Libertarians who wanted the ACA's structure scrapped entirely have been ignored. Other ideas that have percolated on the right, like universal catastrophic coverage, were never considered seriously by Republican legislators.
Of course, more complicated plans, or proposals that cater to the populist wing of Trump's base, would require actual compromise. But Republicans clawed their way to control of the government by refusing to do just that—by denouncing any deviation from anti-government orthodoxy as socialism or worse. The closer they got to winning, the more their visioned narrowed—in 2015, far-right conservatives overthrew House Speaker John Boehner for being insufficiently inflexible. In March, that same group of diehards successfully brought down the first draft of this same bill for not doing enough to wipe out the Affordable Care Act.
Republicans wouldn't have taken over the White House and Congress without such a pure, crusading spirit. It fires up their base and forces politicians to toe the conservative line lest they face primary challenges from the right. Rage at Obama and the Democrats may have poisoned American politics for a generation, but it worked. The Republicans won.
But you can't govern on rage. Well, you can, and we're finding out what that looks like right now. So far, it's pretty fucking ugly.

Health department officials in New York are warning people about a potentially rabid and “unusually aggressive squirrel” that has recently bitten five people in a park in Brooklyn.
The New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene urged anyone who has come under squirrel attack since July 10 to seek treatment for rabies exposure and take victimized pets to a veterinarian.
“This animal has exhibited extremely unusual behavior and we are urging anyone who has been bitten by it, including any pets, to go and see your doctor or veterinarian,” Health Commissioner Mary T. Bassett said Friday in a statement. “Most squirrel bites occur when someone attempts to feed the animal. Keep a safe distance from wildlife and never feed wild animals.”
[‘It's jumping on people and biting them': Squirrel attack leaves 3 injured at retirement home]
Five people were bitten by a squirrel from July 18-20 near the Parkside and Ocean Avenue entrance to Prospect Park in Brooklyn, according to the New York City health department.
“This is an isolated incident. Squirrels are rarely infected with rabies; however, based on the unusual aggressive behavior, the Health Department is acting under the assumption that the animal is rabid,” the department said in the statement.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warns that bites from wild animals that cannot be tested should be treated as exposure to rabies. However, the agency states that squirrels are generally believed to pose little risk to humans.
“Small mammals such as squirrels, rats, mice, hamsters, guinea pigs, gerbils, chipmunks, rabbits, and hares are hardly ever found to be infected with rabies and have not been known to cause rabies among humans in the United States,” according to the CDC. “Bites by these animals are usually not considered a risk of rabies unless the animal was sick or behaving in any unusual manner and rabies is widespread in your area.”
The New York City health department said that the state has not found a squirrel with rabies since it began its surveillance program in 1992 and that there have been no known transmissions from squirrels to humans in the United States.
Still, warnings have been posted near the park entrance where the squirrel attacked its victims.

PresidentDonald Trumpended payments to health insurance companies serving the poorest Obamacare customers in order to deliberately destroy the health care law, former chief White House strategistSteve Bannonsaid.
“Not gonna make the CSR [cost-sharing reduction] payments. Gonna blow that thing up, gonna blow those [insurance] exchanges up, right?” Steve Bannon, the executive chairman of the website Breitbart News,said Saturday in a speech at the Values Voter Summit, a conservative convention in Washington, D.C.
The White HouseannouncedThursday that Trump would halt the cost-sharing payments, creating further instability in the health insurance exchanges set up under Obamacare. Almost6 million low-incomeAmericans qualified for the subsidy when they enrolled this year in the program, according to the Department of Health and Human Services.
Trump defended his decision to end the subsidies, claiming they were a “windfall” to insurance companies.
Health Insurance stocks, which have gone through the roof during the ObamaCare years, plunged yesterday after I ended their Dems windfall! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 14, 2017
Several top Republicans disputed the president's characterization of the cost-sharing subsidies on the Sunday news talk shows.
Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine), one of three GOP senators who voted against repealing Obamacare earlier this year, said Trump's decision to end the payments is “affecting the ability of vulnerable people to receive health care right now.”
“This is not a bailout of the insurers,” she said on CNN's “State of the Union.” “What this money is used for is to help low-income people afford their deductibles and their co-pays so that their health care is available to them.”
Asked whether Trump's decision hurt ordinary Americans, Collins said, “I do believe that.”
“If they can't afford their deductibles, then their insurance is pretty much useless,” Collins added.
Ohio Gov. John Kasich (R) also criticized the president's decision to end the payments.
“These were payments to insurance companies to make sure that hardworking Americans, who don't make a lot of money, can have their copayments taken care of,” Kasich said on NBC's “Meet the Press.” “It's a subsidy to do that. And what this decision is leading to are higher prices.”

The Sarah Michelle Gellar-fronted TV series reboot of Cruel Intentions is, indeed, as dead as Sebastian Valmont (too soon?), our sister site Deadline reports.
As referenced in a recent Ask Ausillo, the drama — which NBC failed to greenlight in October — will not find new life at another network. Sony, the production studio, had shopped the project around this fall. Per Deadline, the cast's extended options are up next week and won't be renewed.
RELATEDThis Is Us to Marathon on the USA Network
As recently as the Television Critics Association summer press tour, NBC president Jennifer Salke said that she was “determined to find a place to put” Cruel Intentions, adding, “We wouldn't have held that talent if we didn't have every intention of finding an opportunity for the show.”
The Cruel Intentions pilot picked up roughly 16 years after the events of the 1999 film, with Annette — now played by Kate Levering — raising her and Sebastian's teenage son Bash in Ohio. Annette once again crosses paths with Sebastian's sister Kathryn (Gellar) when Bash runs away to San Diego, seeking the truth about his father's past.

New Delhi: While presenting the budget for Delhi last month, finance minister Manish Sisodia announced an expenditure of ₹ 102 crore on training of teachers and principals in the new fiscal year. This was just ₹ 9.4 crore last year. Sisodia said his aim was to bring government schools to world class standards in Delhi. While one would have to wait and see whether these goals are realized, improving learning outcomes and perception of government schools seems to be a national problem.
A recent National Sample Survey Organisation (NSSO) report shows that a majority of students studying in private schools do so to make sure that they get better quality education. The survey was conducted between January and June 2014.
The problem of quality in government educational institutions seems to be more acute at the school level. Consider this: among 100 people who prefer private schools in rural India, more than 92 do it for three reasons. One, better learning environment in private schools; two, English being the medium of instruction in private schools; three, quality of education being unsatisfactory in government schools. The figure is above 70% in both rural and urban areas up to higher secondary level, with the exception of higher secondary level in rural areas, where it is 64%. For graduate and above and diploma level, the tables turn. Majority turns to private educational providers because of lack of supply—the reasons being absence of a government institution in the vicinity, or inability to get admission into one.
The perception about private schools being superior seems to be rooted in experience. As per the Annual Status of Education Report (ASER) 2014, learning outcomes in private schools in rural areas have been consistently better than government schools, with the gap widening in most cases. For example, the percentage point gap between children studying in standard five in private and government schools who could do division was 10.3 in 2010. This increased to 18.6 in 2014. The situation is similar for other learning indicators as well.
Experts say that at junior levels, it is the parents who choose private schools for their children as they believe private schools can offer better all-round education. Parth Shah, president at the Centre for Civil Society, said one mother wanted her young child to study in a private school because the teachers there regularly checked the nails and the uniform of the children.
“Punctuality, hygiene and discipline—these are the three soft skills parents look at while getting their children admitted in elementary school," he said.
Besides that, it is of course the lure of the English language. In a lot of government schools, children are taught in their regional languages and parents know that even a little knowledge of English can go a long way for their child in the future, Shah said.
Then again, private schools are known to have higher attendance levels of teachers and are known to be less discriminatory. “A lot of the teachers in rural areas in government schools are money-lenders. So naturally, attendance levels are affected as priorities are split," he added. Shah also underlines the importance of measuring learning outcomes regularly to improve accountability of teachers in government educational institutions.
Not to mention the higher social statement that a private school makes. “If I am high status, I must send (my child) to private school," said Anurag Behar, CEO, Azim Premji Foundation.
The preference for government institutions in higher education seems to be coming from the dominance of public sector in this field.
According to Shah, it has only been over the last decade or so that private players have begun to enter into the education space in a big way. “There are many institutes in the private space, but naturally, they are not yet able to compete with a Presidency College or a Xaviers or an Indian Institute of Technology," he said.
At the same time, with teachers being paid well at higher levels in government colleges, quality of education is considered to be better in comparison with their private counterparts. Attracting teachers of similar qualifications or teaching experience would make it a lot costlier for a private college.
There is one caveat to this analysis. The difference between learning outcomes of government and private schools might also be influenced by factors outside the school. The 2014 ASER report states that accounting for all other factors, a smaller proportion of the gap is attributable to private schools themselves.
“It is a well-established fact that household and other characteristics of private school children are very different from those of government schoolchildren. Since learning levels depend not only on the characteristics of a child's school but also on their own characteristics and those of their household, attribution of all the observed differences in learning levels to differences in schools is incorrect," the report stated.
In fact, one can go a step further. Economic research on public goods shows that the elite opting out of public provisioning of such goods negatively impacts the quality of supply. This is because they are the best suited to exercise political pressure and maintain accountability. Thus, in a society where the rich confine themselves to private schools, it would take more than money to improve the quality of education in government schools.
GENEVA/LONDON (Reuters) - The mosquito-borne Zika virus, which has been linked to brain damage in thousands of babies in Brazil, is likely to spread to all countries in the Americas except for Canada and Chile, the World Health Organization said on Monday.

Zika transmission has not yet been reported in the continental United States, although a woman who fell ill with the virus in Brazil later gave birth to a brain-damaged baby in Hawaii.
Brazil's Health Ministry said in November that Zika was linked to a fetal deformation known as microcephaly, in which infants are born with smaller-than-usual brains.
Brazil has reported 3,893 suspected cases of microcephaly, the WHO said last Friday, over 30 times more than in any year since 2010 and equivalent to 1-2 percent of all newborns in the state of Pernambuco, one of the worst-hit areas.
The Zika outbreak comes hard on the heels of the Ebola epidemic in West Africa, demonstrating once again how little-understood diseases can rapidly emerge as global threats.
“We've got no drugs and we've got no vaccines. It's a case of deja vu because that's exactly what we were saying with Ebola,” said Trudie Lang, a professor of global health at the University of Oxford. “It's really important to develop a vaccine as quickly as possible.”
Large drugmakers' investment in tropical disease vaccines with uncertain commercial prospects has so far been patchy, prompting health experts to call for a new system of incentives following the Ebola experience.
“We need to have some kind of plan that makes (companies) feel there is a sustainable solution and not just a one-shot deal over and over again,” Francis Collins, director of the U.S. National Institutes of Health, said last week.
The Sao Paulo-based Butantan Institute is currently leading the research charge on Zika and said last week it planned to develop a vaccine “in record time”, although its director warned this was still likely to take three to five years.
British drugmaker GlaxoSmithKline (GSK.L) said on Monday it was studying the feasibility of using its vaccine technology on Zika, while France's Sanofi (SASY.PA) said it was reviewing possibilities.
RIO CONCERNS
The virus was first found in a monkey in the Zika forest near Lake Victoria, Uganda, in 1947, and has historically occurred in parts of Africa, Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. But there is little scientific data on it and it is unclear why it might be causing microcephaly in Brazil.
Laura Rodrigues of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine said it was possible the disease could be evolving.
If the epidemic was still going on in August, when Brazil is due to host the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro, then pregnant women should either stay away or be obsessive about covering up against mosquito bites, she said.
The WHO advised pregnant women planning to travel to areas where Zika is circulating to consult a healthcare provider before traveling and on return.
The clinical symptoms of Zika are usually mild and often similar to dengue, a fever which is transmitted by the same Aedes aegypti mosquito, leading to fears that Zika will spread into all parts of the world where dengue is commonplace.
More than one-third of the world's population lives in areas at risk of dengue infection, in a band stretching through Africa, India, Southeast Asia and Latin America.
Zika's rapid spread, to 21 countries and territories in the Americas since May 2015, is due to the prevalence of Aedes aegypti and a lack of immunity among the population, the WHO said in a statement.
RISK TO GIRLS
Like rubella, which also causes mild symptoms but can lead to birth defects, health experts believe a vaccine is needed to protect girls before they reach child-bearing age.
Evidence about other transmission routes, apart from mosquito bites, is limited.
“Zika has been isolated in human semen, and one case of possible person-to-person sexual transmission has been described. However, more evidence is needed to confirm whether sexual contact is a means of Zika transmission,” the WHO said.
While a causal link between Zika and microcephaly has not yet been definitively proven, WHO Director-General Margaret Chan said the circumstantial evidence was “suggestive and extremely worrisome”.
In addition to finding a vaccine and potential drugs to fight Zika, some scientists are also planning to take the fight to the mosquitoes that carry the disease.

Oxitec, the UK subsidiary of U.S. synthetic biology company Intrexon XON.N, hopes to deploy a self-limiting genetically modified strain of insects to compete with normal Aedes aegypti.
Oxitec says its proprietary OX513A mosquito succeeded in reducing wild larvae of the Aedes mosquito by 82 percent in an area of Brazil where 25 million of the transgenic insects were released between April and November. Authorities reported a big drop in dengue cases in the area.
All it takes is a trip downtown at 6 p.m. on a weeknight to see the changes.
Bikes overflow the racks on Castro Street and are locked to every available tree and post. Crowds of people cross Central Expressway on foot and on bikes with each signal cycle. The Caltrain platform teems with riders pushing their way onto trains that are standing room-only by the time they reach Palo Alto.
This is not just casual observation either. Caltrain recently released the results of its passenger counts and triennial customer survey: ridership is at an all-time high with a 54 percent increase since 2010; ridership growth continues to strain capacity in peak periods; and all but one station saw growth. Caltrain sees this growth as a sign of continued economic recovery, as anyone who fights workday traffic on Highway 101 can attest.
Much of Caltrain's growth comes from bikes. The number of people bringing bikes aboard has grown a whopping 121 percent since 2010, more than double the overall ridership growth rate. While the growth is partly due to Caltrain adding a second bike car to every train in 2011, bike-aboard ridership has continued to increase, up 19.6 percent last year. This year bike-aboard riders make up over 11 percent of all riders, making Caltrain the nation's leader in bikes-on-transit. And yet, despite a capacity of 80 bikes on most trains, people with bikes are still regularly denied boarding due to overcrowding, primarily in Peninsula cities from Millbrae to Mountain View. That's how popular the service is.
What's more, how people arrive and depart stations is rapidly changing. While walking to reach stations has increased modestly by 7 percent since 2010, taking transit (VTA, BART, Muni or shuttles) is flat at 4 to 7 percent. The most dramatic changes are that driving to and parking at stations has dropped by 24 percent and bicycling to the station is up 30 percent. And that's just the last three years.
So what does this mean? It means that some commonly-held assumptions that we're too suburban to rely on walking, biking and transit, and that people won't shift from solo driving, are wrong. People already are. In fact, 40 percent of Caltrain riders report they are car-free and that doesn't include "car-lite" riders like me who own a car they rarely use. Today's transit-dependent riders are not low-income either. The average Caltrain rider makes $117,000 a year. Most riders are making a conscious choice to not drive that's not simply driven by economics. It's driven by a desire to escape wasting time driving in traffic.
For Caltrain, it means recognizing that for many riders, bikes are the most convenient first and last mile solution, faster than shuttles for trips up to 3 miles when there's congestion, and cheaper than car parking at stations, both for the rider and for Caltrain. It means ensuring that bike capacity of new electrified trains is at least 10 percent of total capacity. It means expanding bike share into office areas like North Bayshore and into popular housing areas like the Mission in San Francisco.
For cities, it means not spending money on expensive parking garages that will bring more vehicles into congested areas, and instead improve walking and biking connections to existing and emerging office and housing areas like San Antonio Center and El Camino Real. It means implementing Transportation Demand Management programs (TDMs) like Stanford did, with incentives that go beyond shuttles to include benefits for people who take transit, bike, walk, carpool or drive at off-peak times. And consider charging for parking at office sites. It's hard to compete with free.
Times have changed and people are showing they want options other than driving. How will we invest to support them?

OPINION
Moneual, a maker of home appliances such as home theater PCs and robot vacuum cleaners, was once lauded as an adorable up-and-coming small enterprise. Investors, government officials and even Bill Gates hailed the company as a champion of innovation.
On paper, the company's performance was more than impressive. Moneual, founded in 2004, joined the club of firms whose sales exceeded 1 trillion won last year, boasting 1.27 trillion won in sales and 110 billion won in operating profit.
No wonder it was inducted into the ranks of the “Hidden Champions,” a group of promising small- and medium-sized enterprises named by the Export-Import Bank of Korea. No one questioned the value and potential of this marvelous tech firm which grew by an average of 50 percent each year.
As it turned out, this success story was nothing but a fraud. The company went bankrupt last month, and its founder and two other executives were put behind bars on charges of tax evasion, fraud and operating slush funds.
What happened was that the founding CEO, Park Hong-seok, fabricated documents to overstate the value of home theater PCs shipped overseas. He used them to receive export financing amounting to 3.2 trillion won over a six-year period, starting in 2009.
The company even operated a bogus plant and storage facility in Hong Kong, which were staffed by temporary workers only when bankers or trade officials visited. It sounds like a perfect racket.
Using the ill-gotten money, Park operated slush funds worth 44.6 billion won, and he brought 12 billion won of this into Korea to use personally, for gambling, buying a private mansion and paying credit card bills. Creditor banks have yet to recover 674.5 billion won.
What leaves us speechless is that few in the banks, state-run trade insurers, customs and tax agencies, and financial watchdogs knew about this large-scale fraud during the past six years. It truly is incomprehensible that the case came to the fore only after the company filed for bankruptcy.
This proves that there must be many loopholes in the country's export financing and bank loans. The Moneual case should prompt an extensive review and an overhaul, if necessary, of the export finance system.
The prosecution should get to the bottom of the case. We know that there must be corrupt officials at banks and trade-related agencies involved in a case like this.
Venus Automaton Design Recalls Mechanical Computers
I don't usually talk about spacecraft close to our own Sun, but exceptions invariably arise. Centauri Dreams took a close look at the Parker Solar Probe back in June, because its operations close to the Sun (within about 10 solar radii) have implications for how we might build the kind of spacecraft that can perform ‘sundiver' maneuvers, approaching the Sun before deploying a solar sail for maximum effect (see Parker Solar Probe: Implications for Sundiver). Sundivers are one way to maximize acceleration for future interstellar missions.
And then there's Venus, a planet I've written little about in these pages. The Automaton Rover for Extreme Environments (AREE) concept study now being funded by the NASA Innovative Advanced Concepts program is intriguing because it looks at spacecraft design from a fresh angle, actually one that harkens back to generations of mechanical devices that have had little part in space exploration. At least, until now. For while the environment on Venus challenges all our surface rover concepts, a hybrid mechanical/electronic design might save the day. The implications for other extreme environments in the outer system are quite interesting.
AREE grows out of ideas first proposed in 2015 by JPL engineer Jonathan Sauder, who drew on his knowledge of mechanical computers, the sort of calculating machines that use levers and gears instead of microchips. Think of Charles Babbage's Difference Engine, which was designed in the 19th Century, or the Greek Antikythera mechanism, which could tell the Hellenistic world in ancient times about upcoming astronomical events like eclipses.
Image: AREE is a clockwork rover inspired by mechanical computers. A JPL team is studying how this kind of rover could explore extreme environments, like the surface of Venus. Credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech.
Sauder likes the idea of using analog technologies on Venus because electronics don't last long under its extreme pressure and temperatures. If we can limit the use of electronics to the bare essentials and do the rest with analog techniques, we change the paradigm.
The power source? Wind turbines in the center of the rover, storing energy in a constant force spring. Tank treads, or something similar, would replace wheels, while communications would be handled by a rotating shutter placed in front of a bright radar target. The idea would be to turn the bright reflection on and off. Venus rover, meet the Royal Navy circa 1800 communicating with flags and signal lamps.
Build AREE right and you get long-duration in-situ mobility, a rover that might last on Venus' hellish surface for a year or more (Soviet Veneras lasted for minutes or hours). Sauder considers it an automaton, ‘a mechanical device capable of performing a series of complex actions to achieve a specific result.' I like the way AREE is described on this NIAC page:
[Automatons] have long been explored as art forms but remain unexplored for space applications. The automaton rover is designed to reduce requirements on electronics while requiring minimal human interaction and based on the subsumption architecture from robotics, where simple reactions of the rover lead to complex behavior. AREE combines steampunk with space exploration to enable science measurements unachievable with today's space technology.
And the Phase 1 report notes: “High temperature electronics are incorporated where they have sufficient maturity and application, such as instrumentation.”
In other words, we are looking at a hybrid rover heavily dependent on mechanical methods but using electronics where needed. I hasten to add that this concept is maturing and may change substantially as a result of the Phase II work.
Consider the history of Venus exploration to see why alternate approaches are interesting. Venus' surface reaches 460 degrees Celsius, hot enough to melt lead, while the surface pressures are high enough to crush the hull of a nuclear submarine at 90 bar. The Soviets attempted 14 landings in their Venera and Vega programs, nine of these being a success, but the sturdy probes lasted no more than two hours or so before being rendered inoperative.
“When you think of something as extreme as Venus, you want to think really out there,” said Evan Hilgemann, a JPL engineer working on high temperature designs for AREE. “It's an environment we don't know much about beyond what we've seen in Soviet-era images.”
The plan, then, is to bake mechanical prototypes of AREE to see how thermal expansion affects their moving parts. Phase 1 of the NIAC study compared mechanical rover technologies to electronics-based rovers using RTG cooling systems and designed to handle high temperatures, finding that current technologies were costly and not yet up to speed. The study also demonstrated the kind of passive signaling that would be deployed on AREE.
Phase II, now in progress, will set about finalizing the locomotion and signaling systems for the mechanical rover and creating a final rover design, a prototype that could perform initial testing. If AREE can work, it could change the game. One recent proposal for a Venus mission used a liquid gas cooling system that despite a price tag between $2 and $3 billion, could survive for less than a day on the surface. Sampling from multiple sites and developing longer-term weather data would be rendered impossible for this kind of device. AREE, with a sharply reduced electronics package, is a relatively low-cost mechanical alternative.
So we may one day be using levers and gears to produce calculations on this hellish world. We can only wonder what Charles Babbage might have made of the idea. Another reference is Pierre Jaquet-Droz, who along with his son produced mechanical automata in the 18th Century of extraordinary complexity. One of these, called The Writer, consisted of 6000 pieces, a mechanical boy with a primitive programmable memory who writes upon paper with real ink.
Mechanical computers experienced major growth in the early 1940s, and as Sauder's Phase 1 report points out, were at their zenith by the 1940s. Nor were they simple affairs: They had gone from solving arithmetical problems to guiding bomb trajectories and aiming shipboard guns, taking atmospheric conditions into account. Sauder points to the Globus mechanical computer, an automaton that provided trajectory data for every Soviet launch until 2002. At the other end of the scale, mechanical watches and clocks can operate for decades — the oldest mechanical clock has been operated for 700 years. Throw in modern advances and we are now talking about a 10,000 year clock designed to function with minimal maintenance.
From the report:
Clever mechanisms can be combined with high temperature electronics to enable a platform that is more capable than either technology by itself. For example, one may consider simple addition. An electronic adder requires 576 transistors to combine two 16-bit numbers. To add numbers larger than 16 bits, multiple iterations through software would be required. However, a mechanical analog differential adder can solve the same problem using only 5 gears.
The goal, then, is to look critically at rover design to minimize the electronics package:
By finding these areas where mechanical solutions are relatively simple, the load on the computer can be reduced, thereby enabling a mission. Of course, a differential adder can only perform the adding operation, whereas a processor made up of many transistors can perform many other functions. But for an automaton, where the system is designed to carry out a specialized series of actions, this flexibility is not required.
Image: Figure 9 from the Phase I report. A simple example of an analog mechanical computer with multiple inputs. Credit: Jonathan Sauder.
Note that the ability to make science measurements is what Sauder considers one of the greatest weaknesses of a purely mechanical system. We can think, then, of hybrid rovers in which electronics are reduced sharply in complexity by using mechanical analog systems where possible, but still deployed if necessary for high-resolution data. Back to the Phase I report:
Additional study is necessary to leverage the existing suite of high temperature electronics to make critical science measurements targeted towards the mission context. Furthermore, in the coming months it is expected several specific high temperature electronic technologies will be announced for further development through the Hot Tech program. The selection will define what scientific measurements will become the most relevant with soon to be released technology. Therefore, instead of focusing on instrument development, this [Phase 1] study focuses on developing a mobile platform for Venus and other extreme environments which could host various instrument payloads.
And now we move on to the Phase II study. A comeback for automata may prove useful not only on Venus but in any number of difficult environments where the data collection may be basic but persist for long periods of time. Operations near Jupiter, for example, produce significant radiation problems and demand extensive shielding for electronics, just as high pressure environments beneath planetary atmospheres (the interior of a gas giant) challenge the survivability of our best electronic probes. Venus could turn out to be an interesting test case for how we add mechanical methods into our toolkit of deep space exploration.

The big plan was to have a super-cool new animation video today, but despite a valiant all-night effort to eradicate a glitch that stands in the way of an exciting vid – it stubbornly persists. So: sad face.
Mondoid waits for no man, however, so Romain ‘RJ' Dron has thrown his hat into the ring with the full run-down on his current contribution to Build 32! Over to RJ!
CRAFTED DEVICES AND TRAPS
Traps have received some more RJ love since last week, in fact they're pretty much done. I've had a few more ideas I want to add in, but all the items and systems are now working, present and correct. We've mentioned it in a few Mondoids now, but haven't really put anything in an easy-to-read fact list – so here are the basics of my stuff in Build 32.
With new engineering and electrician skills you can now build, throw and detonate device and traps to aid you in your survival attempts. There are explosive devices, fire-spreading weapons like molotovs, a smokebomb and a noisemaker – for example.
As well as throwing these in/around crowds of zeds, they can also be set down and triggered in various ways. There's the movement sensor, for example, that will need to be crafted from the movement sensor in a home's burglar alarm. Each constructed device, meanwhile, has its own level of effectiveness – meaning that a character who is an electrician by trade will be able to build a better movement sensor than someone who's just learnt from books they've looted.
Beyond the movement sensor we've got a timer – an old classic! This can be crafted from a kitchen timer or an alarm clock and it's pretty simple: put it into your device, set the timer before ignition and wait! Finally, there's a remote control. You can craft a trigger from electronic scrap found in devices and a receiver that's found in, for example, radios. Then take a remote control for a television set, link the devices [through a simple right click ‘link to' dropdown menu] and place the crafted receiver on your device. The higher your skills, the better the receiver – and the further away you'll be able to trigger the explosion. Just think: when NPCs come around you'll be able to leave all sorts of surprises in their safehouse!
GENERATORS
I'm currently working on generators, after doing a lot of research on them. You'll find them in sheds, garages and storage units in Build 32. They're not all that rare BUT they do require certain skills to operate them. As such, an electrician will know how to use a generator, but an average joe will have to get some reading done!
If you know how to operate them, however, then you can carry them [although they are really heavy!] to the outside of your safehouse, plug it in and turn it on. A wise survivor, however, probably won't place it inside the house as, yes, the threat of poisoning will be very real. Electricity will then be provided in the home – and the generator will slowly consume fuel and lose condition as it does so. Fuel itself will be obtainable at any gas pump in the game, while there's still electricity to pump it. Comfort does have a price though, and users should be aware that generators make a hell of a lot of noise, and might get a bit explode-y and fire-y should their condition deteriorate to dangerous levels.
WILL AND TURBO STUFF
Will continues to write radio and television transmissions, and is looking with mounting horror at how much there's left to do compared with what Romain is industriously ticking off his Build 32 list. Turbo meanwhile, with 95% of his broadcast system in place, is still fiddling with the innards of his ApCom mod with an eye to bringing it over in a future build.
He did, however, find the time to allow certain images in MP chat. This led to a spurious demand from Will, which ultimately led to the creation of a video in which a lady hacks zombies to bits while singing ‘The Hills are Alive' from ‘The Sound of Music'.

It looks like a prop from Star Wars doesn't it? Trust the Soviets to have the coolest abandoned stuff lying around. During the cold war period and into the 1980s, this rusting behemoth was once part of a fleet of vessels which rose out of the water at high speed and were considered the heroes of the Russian riverways.
(c) Ratmir base Lead image
The streamlined Soviet passenger boats used a hydrofoil technology that lifted the boat's hull out of the water, decreasing drag and allowing it to travel at incredible speeds of up to 150 km/hr.
Dark Roasted Blend via
They were nicknamed Raketas (“Rockets”) and some models were even fitted with airplane turbine engines on each side.
Soviet inventor Rostislav Alexeyev was considered the ‘father' of modern hydrofoil and nearly 3,000 vessels were built for Russian and Ukranian waterways. Over the years, many different models were introduced with names inspired by the Soviet space age, like “Sputnik”, “Comet”, “Meteor” and “Stormbringer”.
But then came the economic collapse of the Soviet Union and production of the hydrofoils ceased. Vessels were decommissioned, sent to rust away in ship graveyards, like this one in a forest near the city of Perm ↓
Others found their way out of the Soviet Union as far as Vietnam, where the 1970s Voshkod hydrofoil boats are still in service, operating a daily route between the Cat Ba island and the city of Hai Phong.
You can find others still gliding down rivers in Canada, Greece, Yugoslavia, Netherlands, Thailand and Turkey. Here's one in China…
For many Russians, the hydrofoils are a fond childhood memory from the golden age of Soviet innovation. One wealthy Russian even converted one into a luxury yacht…

This one found a less glamorous fate as a bar inside of what looks like a housing estate in Ukraine ↓

Abbott decries 'socialist' carbon scheme
Updated
Opposition Leader Tony Abbott says "millions of Australians will be worse off" under the Government's carbon price scheme.
Prime Minister Julia Gillard has unveiled the details of the scheme she says will chart Australia's course to a "clean energy future", saying the price on carbon pollution will start at $23 per tonne from next year and then increase by 2.5 per cent above inflation until a market-based trading scheme takes over in 2015.
More than $15 billion is being set aside to compensate households via tax reform and direct payments, and the Government says the average household will be 20 cents a week better off.
Reacting to the announcement of the scheme, Mr Abbott dismissed the Government's "pollie speak" and said the plan would cost jobs, drive up prices and do nothing for the environment.
Mr Abbott said that when the Government said 90 per cent of households would get compensation and 40 per cent would be overcompensated, it really meant that 10 per cent of households would get "absolutely nothing" and 60 per cent would be either worse off or "line ball".
He said there are many "cameos" of households and family types that will be worse off.
"The one that particularly struck me is a single-income family on $65,000 a year, below average weekly earnings, with one child under five is worse off," Mr Abbott told a press conference.
"I think the Government is going to find, having published all this, is that it suffers the death of a thousand cameos as so many people look at these figures and decide that they are not going to be better off at all."
And he seized on the built-in carbon price rise of 2.5 per cent above inflation for the first three years, saying it will just go "up and up and up".
He said that even on the Government's own figures emissions will still increase and could only be offset by buying permits from abroad.
"This is an extraordinary business. Under the Government's own proposals Australian businesses are going to spend more than $3 billion a year purchasing abatements from abroad.
"We all know the potential for fraud, the potential for scamming. Even the European emissions trading scheme has been riddled with scamming and that's in a culture where administrative probity is held in high respect."
Mr Abbott also suggested the carbon price would not generate "anything like" the revenue the Government was expecting, so the household compensation would have to come out of the budget.
"There is a real fiscal hole beyond the [four-year] forward estimates period."
He described the scheme as "socialism masquerading as environmentalism".
"What's the point of all of this? This is a redistribution pretending to be compensation, it's a tax increase pretending to be an environmental policy."
Demanding that an election be held soon on the carbon price, Mr Abbott said the next election would be a referendum on the issue.
"If this is such a good package, why won't the Prime Minister fight an election on it?" he asked.
"Why won't she fight an election on it soon? Certainly there should be no carbon tax without the people of Australia having their chance to have their say on it."
Shadow treasurer Joe Hockey described the $10 billion Clean Energy Finance Corporation - which will provide loans to innovative clean energy projects - as the "Gillard Bank".
"Financing speculative investments is putting taxpayers' money at risk. The funds themselves will effectively make every business a welfare recipient," he said.

MOSCOW — In December, Grigorii Bedzhamov, the president of Russia's national bobsled federation, disappeared. He stopped coming to work, stopped answering his cellphone, stopped answering his emails.
A week into the silence, the Russian news media began to report that Mr. Bedzhamov had fled the country amid an emerging bank scandal. The Russian edition of Forbes magazine placed him in Monaco and reported that he was preparing to apply for political asylum in another European country. Soon after, the bobsled federation released a statement saying that Mr. Bedzhamov was on a “planned vacation.”
But almost three months later, Mr. Bedzhamov is still on that vacation, and the federation, which is struggling to pay its bills and its coaches, says it has still not heard from him.
“No idea,” Kirill Serikov, the federation's acting director, said when asked about his colleague's whereabouts.
The first "must know" about EPA's "Clean Power Plan" (CPP) is that electricity is good and enables the basic services for human existence. We want to encourage, not discourage, the use of electricity. Electricity is a particularly high form of energy and the efficiency in which it is utilized far exceeds the inefficiency of generating it.
Electro-technologies are systems and equipment that use electricity to produce and process consumer goods. From refrigerators to vacuum cleaners to laptop computers, electro-technologies are all around us and becoming more pervasive in our lives, not less. Electro-technologies are more efficient than their fuel-burning counterparts and, unlike standard fuels, have no waste products at the point of use. No smoke, ash, combustion gas, noise, or odor.
Capitalizing on the energy- and CO2-saving potential of electricity is critical to securing a sustainable energy future and a clean and safe environment. Electro-technologies also offer a variety of non-energy advantages: better manufacturing precision and control, improved product quality, higher worker productivity, and reduced environmental impacts.
Thus, the least developed and most air polluted nations on Earth are those that use the least amount of electricity (see here). To illustrate, promoted by environmental groups as the solution to "green" transportation, electric cars could expand home power use by more than 50%, while reducing "well-to-wheel" GHG emissions 30-50%.
Figure 1: The Benefits of Electro-Technologies: More Electricity Means More Efficiency, Less CO2

Overall, the CPP aims to cut CO2 emissions by 30% from 2005 levels by 2030, with an interim target of 25% on average between 2020 and 2029. The CPP allows states to craft their own compliance plans, with some reported flexibility measures. Yet, some see EPA forcing states to impose a mix of California-style capping, taxing, and mandating. I've already documented here how it's actually been natural gas that's winning California's "rush to renewables."
For the U.S., natural gas just surpassed coal for the first time as the top source of power generation. About 31% of electric power in April was natural-gas fired, versus 30% for coal. The 2030 target set for each state will be based on the capacity to reduce emissions using EPA's four “building blocks," all of them favoring natural gas:
1. Make fossil fuel power plants more efficient.
Per EIA, "to express the efficiency of a generator or power plant as a percentage, divide the equivalent Btu content of a kWh of electricity (which is 3,412 Btu) by the heat rate...if the heat rate is 10,500 Btu, the efficiency is 33%. If the heat rate is 7,500 Btu, the efficiency is 45%." A lower heat rate is more efficient, requiring less fuel consumption while also reducing emissions. Natural gas has a heat rate of just 7,948 per kilowatt hour, compared to 10,449 for nuclear and 10,459 for coal (see here).
2. Use low-emitting natural gas combined cycle plants more where excess capacity is available.
Cleaner natural gas is the power source of choice of those energy sources that are the most affordable and reliable. Per EPA, the average emission rates in the U.S. for natural gas-fired generation per MWh are 1,135 lbs of CO2, 0.1 lbs of SO2, and 1.7 lbs of NOx....compared to 2,249 lbs of CO2, 13 lbs of SO2, and 6 lbs of NOx for coal. Natural gas will be the main low-cost compliance option.
3. Use more zero- and low-emitting power sources such as renewables and nuclear.
4. Reduce electricity demand by using electricity more efficiently.
I've already documented (see here) how the U.S. has become much more electricity efficient, yet electricity use continues to grow - only down recently because of The Great Recession, which left us with stagnant/fallen incomes. More people, making more money...need more energy.
The Clean Power Plan (CPP) Will Make Natural Gas Easily the Most Important Source of Electricity, from the latest (2015) EIA Annual Energy Outlook (AEO) for 2030

Consumer societies like ours, where spending constitutes nearly 75% of the economy, need huge amounts of power available all the time, and cheaper energy to increase disposable income. And it's natural gas that gains market share under normal conditions: "the wind doesn't blow" and "the sun doesn't shine." Even in the current low price environment, U.S. natural gas production continues to boom. EIA's "High Oil and Gas Resource" scenario is rapidly materializing.
EIA's reference case already has U.S. natural gas production rising from 75 Bcf/day in 2014 to 91 Bcf/day in 2030 and over 97 Bcf/day in 2040. Experts at Navigant have U.S. gas output soaring to 110 Bcf/day by 2035! I've already documented both the massive oil (see here) and natural gas (see here) resources/reserves at our disposal.
And natural gas prices will be adequate for producers because the demand market will be there: fuel switching to gas electricity, a manufacturing revival based on gas, idiosyncratic gas uses such as vehicles and the backup for wind and solar power, and the emerging liquified natural gas (LNG) export business. U.S. gas demand has been outpacing even the best forecasting models (see here).
And the rise of natural gas isn't due to political favoritism, California for instance is expensively doing all it can to incorporate renewables and natural gas is still easily winning, but because of affordability, availability, and reliability. Additionally, if a carbon tax is ever thrown into the mix (U.S. Senator Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island wants $42/metric ton), natural gas could surge to over 60% of our electricity - double today's share. Led by Florida, Texas, and Utah, gas is clearly the leader in new power capacity additions.
In fact, the CPP makes it basically impossible to build a new coal power plant without carbon capture and storage, which would increase costs 80%! Some 90 gigawatts of coal capacity, about 30% of the total, could retire by 2020 - more than double the retirements projected in the EIA's Annual Energy Outlook 2015 base case.
The Breakthrough Institute has shown how it's natural gas that fills the coal void. And assuming a $15 per ton CO2 tax in 2020, natural gas is EIA's clear winner at a levelized cost of electricity of $75 per MWh. EIA classifies wind and solar power as still "non-dispatchable" in 2020, compared to "dispatchable" natural gas, more reliable and available as needed.
Indeed, the symbiotic relationship between natural gas and renewables, where gas is the "spinning reserve" backup generation required to compensate for their intermittency, is exactly why those blocking more natural gas infrastructure projects are actually blocking more wind and solar development.

Former vice president Richard B. Cheney personally oversaw at least four briefings with senior members of Congress about the controversial interrogation program, part of a secretive and forceful defense he mounted throughout 2005 in an effort to maintain support for the harsh techniques used on detainees.
The Cheney-led briefings came at some of the most critical moments for the program, as congressional oversight committees were threatening to investigate or even terminate the techniques, according to lawmakers, congressional officials, and current and former intelligence officials.
Cheney's role in helping handle intelligence issues in the Bush administration -- particularly his advocacy for the use of aggressive methods and warrantless wiretapping against alleged terrorists -- has been well documented. But his hands-on role in defending the interrogation program to lawmakers has not been previously publicized.
The CIA made no mention of his role in documents delivered to Capitol Hill last month that listed every lawmaker who had been briefed on "enhanced interrogation techniques" since 2002. For meetings that were overseen by Cheney, the agency told the intelligence committees that information about who oversaw those briefings was "not available."
The revelations do not shed light on whether top Democrats, as Republicans contend, were aware that waterboarding, a technique that simulates drowning, was being used on terrorism suspects as early as the fall of 2002. That discussion has dominated Capitol Hill since last month, when House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), who was not present at any of the briefings that included Cheney, accused the agency of intentionally misleading her in a 2002 briefing about the use of waterboarding.
An official who witnessed one of Cheney's briefing sessions with lawmakers said the vice president's presence appeared calculated to give additional heft to the CIA's case for maintaining the program. Cheney left it to the professional briefers to outline the interrogation practices, while he mounted an impassioned defense of the program.
"This is a really important issue for the security of the United States," the official recalled Cheney saying.
The CIA declined to comment on why Cheney's presence in some meetings was left out of the records. One senior intelligence official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said the names of individual briefers are omitted in all cases -- they do not appear in any of the public documents that describe congressional briefings. In at least some cases, he added, the identity of the briefer was never recorded in the agency's records.
For all but seven of the 40 meetings listed, however, the documents outlined which agency led the briefing and which provided support. And on at least five occasions, they spelled out that then-CIA Director Michael V. Hayden led the classified meetings.
Since leaving office in January, Cheney has mounted a vigorous public defense of the interrogation practices. Speaking at the National Press Club on Monday, he said CIA officials approached the White House in 2002 with the request to use harsher techniques such as waterboarding.
"We all approved it. I'm a strong believer in it. I think it was the right thing to do," said Cheney, who is now pushing for the declassification of the information gained from the detainees who were subjected to the most brutal techniques.
Several members of Congress who took part in the Cheney meetings declined to comment on them, citing secrecy concerns. But there was little doubt that he was leading the charge on the issue.
Donald Trump could still be issued with an invitation to address parliament during a state visit to the UK after officials revealed that a room in the House of Lords remains an option.
A spokesperson told the Guardian that the US president could be asked to speak in a second “prestigious venue” in parliament despite John Bercow's extraordinary warning on Monday that he would block any Trump speech in Westminster Hall.
They pointed to remarks made earlier on Tuesday by the Lord Speaker, who insisted he would keep an “open mind” if a request was made, whatever had been said in the House of Commons.
A spokesperson representing Lord Fowler, who is also charged with issuing invitations to speak in parliament, said: “The Royal Gallery might be a possibility. The Royal Gallery is a prestigious venue and has hosted guests in the past including President Reagan.”
Bercow can block a speech being made from Westminster Hall, from where President Obama spoke, but he has made clear he has less say over the Royal Gallery. Sources confirmed that Lord Fowler could allow a speech to go ahead there if he decided it was appropriate.
It comes as Bercow faces a fierce backlash from Conservative MPs and peers who are calling on him to consider his position as Speaker after he took the unprecedented step of voicing his opposition to Trump.
All praise to John Bercow for refusing to bow to racist, sexist Donald Trump | Owen Jones Read more
His comments – that the US president's “racism and sexism” made him unfit to address parliament – won plaudits from Labour and Scottish National party politicians on Monday who clapped and cheered in the Commons' chamber.
In his statement to peers, Fowler complained that Bercow had not kept him informed of his actions: “I should make it clear that I was not consulted on that decision or its timing.” He added that Bercow had said sorry for not informing him in advance.
Fowler said it was not up to a Speaker to make a judgment on whether Trump should visit or not. “My view is that I will keep an open mind and consider any request for Mr Trump to address this parliament if and when it is made,” he said, although he also expressed his own campaigning against prejudice and discrimination, particularly aimed at the LGBT community.
In the Commons, Bercow did not apologise when challenged by MP Sir Gerald Howarth about the importance of neutrality. He responded that the decision to bar the US president from Westminster Hall was within the remit of his role and said he was being honest.
However, the Guardian understands that at least two Conservative MPs have approached parliamentary clerks to ask how to table a no-confidence motion in the Speaker, even though it would be unlikely to pass.
By Tuesday evening, a number of MPs had accused Bercow of overstepping the mark by actively “snubbing” government foreign policy, which aims to build bridges with the new US administration.
Alec Shelbrooke MP said Bercow's job was to “be a referee not a player”. “His position is untenable because he cannot be deemed to be independent and a Speaker must have the respect from all sides of the house,” he told the Guardian.
The MP argued he did not agree with Trump's comments about women, nor his “heavy-fisted, inexperienced act” of banning travellers from seven Muslim-majority countries. But he said this was not about Trump or Bercow, but about about the neutrality of the position.
“His comments undermine government policy,” he added, arguing that Theresa May had chosen to try to influence American policy by engaging with Trump.
He also criticised Bercow for a lack of consistency when he said it was an “honour” to welcome the emir of Kuwait – a country Fowler said had questionable policies towards gay people, women and banned Israeli citizens. Others pointed out that the Speaker had appeared happy with China's president Xi Jinping addressing parliament, despite unrest among MPs about the country's human rights record.
The former culture secretary John Whittingdale said he had been taken aback by the amount of correspondence from people who were “very cross”. “They don't necessarily sign up to everything Trump says but they don't like the very public attack on him by somebody who is supposed to be neutral,” he said.
The Tory MP argued that Bercow was speaking for Labour and SNP politicians – who applauded and cheered his intervention – but not for Conservatives.
“Even if he does have a strong view, the way you do it is to say to Theresa May, privately, ‘Let's save the embarrassment'. He – by gratuitously making a strong attack – has ruled that impossible.”
Even Nadhim Zahawi, an outspoken critic of Trump's travel ban that may have affected his own family, was angry with the Speaker, warning he had opened himself up to “accusations of partiality and hypocrisy”.
Writing in the Guardian, he urged Bercow to reconsider his position. “If we are to make the case to him that it is morally wrong to ban people based on their faith or country of origin, and that his order jeopardises global security, we cannot compromise our ability to do this by banning him from coming to the most famous place of debate and scrutiny in the world,” he said.
The issue caused annoyance in Downing Street and across Whitehall, although sources played down the impact it might have on US relations. It is understood that the question of an address to parliament has not come up during recent conversations with key figures in Trump's administration.
One source insisted the US president wanted the pomp and ceremony of a state visit and was uninterested in the “ultimate establishment” act of addressing Westminster politicians.
– Lucha Underground sent out the following today, announcing that they have officially released Shawn Hernandez. You may remember that Hernandez was the center of controversy when he showed up on Impact while still under a contact to Lucha Underground. Lucha Underground enforced their contractual rights (Hernandez had told TNA that he was released and free to work for them), and TNA ended up having to scrap several segments from Impact that were already recorded. In the fallout, MVP was also released by TNA as he had suggested that the company bring in Hernandez to be part of the BDC faction…
‘LUCHA UNDERGROUND' PARTS WAYS WITH SHAWN HERNANDEZ
Los Angeles, CA (September 25, 2015) – Lucha Underground, the Lucha Libre wrestling franchise from United Artists Media Group and FactoryMade Ventures, has released Shawn Hernandez from his contract and they have amicably parted ways.
“Lucha Underground” is produced by United Artists Media Group in association with FactoryMade Ventures for El Rey Network. Executive producers are Mark Burnett, Eric Van Wagenen (also showrunner) and Brian Edwards of United Artists Media Group; Dorian Roldán from Lucha Libre AAA; Alejandro Garcia and Antonio Cué Sánchez-Navarro; El Rey Network co-founder Robert Rodriguez; and FactoryMade Ventures and El Rey Network co-founders John Fogelman and Cristina Patwa. The series airs on El Rey Network and is distributed internationally by United Artists Media Group.
(UPI) -- An Ohio gynecologist is feeling the burn after a patient filed a lawsuit alleging he sprayed her internally with a chemical found in drain cleaner when he meant to use vinegar.
The patient, identified only as Laura, claims that Dr. John Black doused her with a solution containing the chemical potassium hydroxide while he was performing a routine colposcopy at his office at Paragon Health in Summit County. In addition to Black, other unnamed Paragon Health employees have been listed as defendants.
"I was the victim of a pretty horrific experience at my gynecologist exam," Laura told WKYC-TV. "It was like an open cut with rubbing alcohol being poured into it.”
Laura's husband Paul has been demonstrating outside Paragon's offices with signs claiming that his wife has suffered permanent injuries caused by the burning of her private parts.
"It soaks in and continues to soak in and burns from the inside out. It's not meant to go inside anyone's body," Paul said.
According to the lawsuit, Black suspected something went wrong and attempted to irrigate the burn area with three bottles of saline solution in addition to applying a cream to numb the pain. Unfortunately, Black allegedly wasn't wearing gloves.
"He puts an ungloved dirty finger inside her and rubs a numbing cream inside her. It's disgusting," Paul said.
Laura says the doctor told her: "I hope you're not offended. I just want to let you know I've been married forever, and I don't have any diseases."
Afterward, when she went to the emergency room at Akron General Hospital, doctors found a plastic bottle cap behind Laura's cervix.
Further, when the hospital called to determine the pH level of the liquid, Paragon claimed it was 7.5, basically harmless, though the hospital later discovered it was 12 or higher.
But in Paragon's response to the malpractice lawsuit, Dr. Black maintains that he used a vinegar solution on Laura.
Laura and Paul were hoping to have more children, but now believe she will need a hysterectomy. "This a scenario that no woman would ever, ever imagine," she said.
Deportivo Saprissa is set to allow Josue Martinez to move to the Philadelphia Union, according to La Republica. A throwaway line in the website's game recap of Saprissa's 2-2 draw with Alajuelense included a comment about Martinez's future with Saprissa, saying that the 21-year-old had played his last game with the Costa Rican power. The 21-year-old striker missed two opportunities in the first half, but scored in the 50th minute of the game to give Saprissa hope. Saprissa could not find the extra goal necessary to win the game, however. The Brotherly Game speculated, after talking to knowledgeable sources on Central American soccer, that Martinez would most likely stay with Saprissa if the team progressed onward in Costa Rica's playoffs. However, the 2-2 draw with Alajuelense eliminated Saprissa from the competition, leaving them with the option of offloading their young talent to foreign sides. Martinez is one of the team's three young strikers that are linked to either MLS or Europe, despite Joel Campbell's sale to Arsenal last year, showing Saprissa's ability to foster talent at forward positions. Martinez has been linked to the Union multiple times in the past week, with Sunday being a possible time for his sale to Philadelphia. The Union reportedly offered $1 million for the player in July, but had their offer rejected, with the price supposedly at $2 million for Martinez at the time. Now the forward's price has fallen to around $500,000, making him a perfect candidate to become the Union's first every Young Designated player signing.
"There would be no restriction on him (Joshua) or anyone else who has a chance, for us the priority is to retain the best talent and build equipment, but we can not deny life-changing opportunities to boys who are with us," said Saprissa President Juan Carlos Rojas.
Prior to Sunday's draw, Rojas had tried to fight off rumors of Martinez's departure, but admitted that an MLS team had plenty of interest in the young striker.
"The interest exists and we can not deny that there have been talks, but hey, now we are focused on Sunday's game. On this issue the truth is that at this moment we can not confirm anything, when one is speaking with teams, whether to communicate something is done in a coordinated way and now there is nothing to announce, "said Rojas.
The Union have been looking for new talent up front, according to reports from across the globe, due to the team's inability to consistently find goals. Last season, the Union scored 44 goals, leaving them tied for 7th in MLS, but six of those goals came in a 6-2 win against Toronto FC, and four came in a 4-4 draw against the New England Revolution.
The Costa Rican forward has represented Saprissa 65 times during his short first team career with the club, scoring 18 times. He has also played for Costa Rica's national team on numerous levels of competition, scoring seven times overall between the country's youth and senior squads.

Yet another judicial nominee willing to trample on our rights!
{flike}
Ask your Senator to oppose the gun-hating nominee, Robert Wilkins
The Senate Judiciary Committee will soon begin the first step in taking anti-gun judges and “court-packing” them into what is widely regarded as the nation's second-most-important court — the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.
And, unlike anti-gun judges with no “paper trail,” the nominee, Robert Wilkins, (pictured below and right) has a particularly virulent anti-gun record.
Wilkins was the D.C. District Court judge who decided, last year, that non-resident U.S. citizens do not have the Second Amendment right to purchase a firearm [Dearth v. Holder, 893 F.Supp. 59 (2012)].
Dearth had contended that federal firearms laws and regulations made it effectively impossible for a U.S. citizen residing in Canada to purchase a firearm in the United States.
Wilkins responded, in his opinion on “Second Amendment Claims,” that it didn't matter if a U.S. citizen was legally barred from purchasing a firearm in the United States, because he already owned a gun in Canada and was free to bring it into the country.
What? So if you already own a gun, the Second Amendment doesn't prohibit the government from preventing you from purchasing another one? This comes perilously close to saying that the Second Amendment protects only possession of firearms, and not sales. Hence, this “pre-existing gun argument” could just as easily be used to ban all purchases and sales of firearms by U.S. citizens in the U.S.
This is made even worse by the context in which Wilkins' nomination is being pushed. Currently, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals is not exactly a conservative bastion. Although it overturned the District of Columbia's “Banana Republic” anti-gun laws in the Heller case — as did the Supreme Court on appeal — it upheld ObamaCare and perhaps provided momentum for the Supreme Court to do the same.
Nevertheless, the Obama administration would like to turn the critical D.C. circuit into a liberal stronghold like California's Ninth Circuit — and it is threatening to blow up the Senate rules in order to do so.
ACTION: Please Click here to contact your Senators and demand that they oppose the nomination of anti-gun zealot Robert Wilkins to the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.
Please note that the vote in the Senate Judiciary Committee is JUST THE FIRST STEP. If Wilkins is voted out of the committee, then the full Senate will vote on him soon afterwards. The committee vote is expected on Thursday.
The early portion of the PGA Tour season is a time to look at players who are beginning to show good form. While most casual golf fans won't start paying attention until the beginning January, the Fall can be used to pick out golfers whose games are rounding into shape. Identifying guys who are trending upwards can give you a leg up in your early DraftKings contests or in your office pool set to begin after the new year as you begin to scope out players to fill out your entry.
Identifying in this space Pat Perez and Brendan Steele, our first two winners of this infant season, as an early season riser is too easy. Instead, here are three golfers who aren't in the spotlight that have impressed me so far.
Keegan Bradley
It's been a long three years for the winner of the 2011 PGA Championship. It wasn't long ago that Keegan was a mainstay at the top of the leaderboards and the minds of golf fans as one of the best young Americans the PGA Tour had to offer. He enjoyed tremendous success on Ryder Cups and Presidents Cup squads, teaming with Phil Mickelson and delivered fire and brimstone playing the part of Captain America before Patrick Reed took that role.
While it wasn't his near on-course fisticuffs with Miguel Angel Jimenez that derailed his career, it's more likely due to the ban on anchored putting strokes that sent Keegan into a death spiral down the Official World Golf Rankings. Keegan chooses to early adopt the new rule, scrapping his trusty belly putter for a standard flatstick, and the switch dramatically impacted his performance. Keegan slipped from 47th in 2014 to 128th in 2015 in Strokes Gained – Putting, and combined with a slip in ball striking he quickly became a bit of an afterthought on Tour.
While still regarded as one of the worst putters on tour, Keegan put together a solid year in 2017 to regain a little bit of confidence in his game. Pro golfers can be a little neurotic, and there aren't many that are quite as neurotic as Keegan Bradley as evidence by his happy feet pre-shot routine. Maybe the putter switch wrecked his swagger on the course. But it all came full circle last weekend when he finished 2nd alone at the CIMB Classic and put together four spectacular rounds.
Keegan is back up to 64th in the world and is knocking on the door of the Top 60. That's significant because that's the threshold needed to qualify for most majors and WGC events, tournaments with lucrative world golf ranking points at stake to keep him relevant. If he can keep up his great tee to green game, maybe we see him contend more often on Sunday's next year.
Andrew Landry
Remember him? Landry burst into the mainstream in 2016 when he went toe to toe with Dustin Johnson heading into the final round. While he limped to the finish carding a 78 on Sunday, it was a very admirable performance by the journeyman and showed he had serious stones and toughness.
So what has he been up to since then? Despite his Cinderella performance at the U.S. Open, Landry wasn't able to keep his PGA Tour card and spent 2017 on the Web.com tour. There he began his ascension up the World Golf Rankings, scoring one win and eight other Top 10's on the Web.com circuit to regain his status as a member of the PGA Tour for the 2018 season.
Despite his small stature, Landry can drive it as well as anyone, averaging 305 yards off the tee on the Web.com tour last year. He also ranked 31st in Green In Regulation on tour to set him up for easy birdie opportunities all year. Carrying over this success to the current season, Landry placed T7 at the Safeway Open in his return to the PGA Tour. He's someone to watch as the fall season progresses and could prove to be a sneaky sleeper for your pools and bets early next year.
Hunter Mahan
Hunter Mahan looks over at Tiger Woods' struggles the last two years and raises him a few more shanks and slices. Hunter Mahan was once the poster boy for Golf Digest in their swing analysis articles, perfectly molded by Sean Foley and having a swing coveted by most. He was an annual threat to win multiple tournaments and break through for a major title from 2007 through 2014.
But while students of Sean Foley rave about his scientific, almost nerd like approach to breaking down a golf swing, he's ruined quite a few others as described in this article by Kyle Porter in 2014. Coincidentally enough, it was only a few weeks after this article that Hunter Mahan scored his last victory on the PGA Tour. Following his win at The 2014 Barclays, he slipped all the way from 19th in the world to 859th as of the summer of 2017.
Every now and then I'd catch him on the telecast to try and get clues on where it all went wrong. His swing was completely broken, and you could see how shattered his confidence was. I often beat myself up on the golf course, cursing my bad shots and frantically search to try and find the right plane, hopelessly incredulous on how to get right. It was eye opening to watch Hunter Mahan do the same after a wildly blocked tee shot or mishit iron into a water hazard. These guys are normally unflappable, but to see him just lost on the golf course was tough to watch given how good he was at his apex.
So I was very happy to see him score a nice finish at the Safeway Open a few weeks back, finishing T13 for his highest finish in a PGA Tour event since 2015. What impressed me about it was how he was able to put four consecutive solid rounds of golf together. This doesn't sound all that impressive, but for a guy who was as deep in the weeds as he was, any stability in his game can only be seen as a confidence booster.
He certainly has a long way to go, but it would be very nice to see him making cuts and getting into contention more often in hopes of revitalizing his career. Keep an eye out for how he does over the next few weeks. He'll be playing against some lesser fields, and if he can put together a string of solid performances it might be time to put him back on our radar heading into the New Year.
CJ Cup Picks
This weekend the PGA Tour continues it's Asian Swing by heading to South Korea for the first inaugural CJ Cup at Nine Bridges. Given the growth of golf in South Korea, particularly on the LPGA Tour, it was only a matter of time before the PGA Tour would put a regular tour stop in the country to continue to grow the game.
Because it is the first time the event has been played, herein lies the problem to try and handicap the event. We have no historical data points to reference to. This is typically my strategy when breaking down a tournament by identifying what types of golfers have fared well at the course over the last four or five years, and then picking golfers with similar profiles.
But it's not just cheeky bloggers like me who are scouring Google to find any shred of clues on how the tournament will play. The course has undergone significant renovations over the last few years and no pro in the field has played it in recent memory. The guy with seemingly the most experience for the course – Sung Kang, who grew up near the course and last played it 15 years ago.
So now that I've given you full confidence in my shoot from the hip picks this week, let me tell you what I do know about Nine Bridges. While Nine Bridges plays only 7,196 yards at a Par 72, trouble can find one quickly all over the course. There are numerous water hazards and pot bunkers around the greens and lining the fairways that can ruin a good round in a hurry. I don't think bomb and gauge is necessarily going to be the winning strategy this weekend. It'll be the guys who can set up the best angles to the greens and avoid the big numbers that'll be towards the top of the leaderboard. Therefore, I'm going to try and target solid ball strikers who pepper greens at a high rate and can take advantage of the gettable Par 5's.
ShotLink wasn't available for the CIMB Classic, so once again the 2018 stats are too small of a sample size to gauge the field. For now, you can still use the 2017 stats as a guide, but start incorporating more and more recent form into your analysis as the Fall drags on.
The Favorites:
Justin Thomas – 7/1, $12,100 DraftKings
Paul Casey – 9/1, $11,600 DraftKings
Jason Day – 10/1, $10,600 DraftKings
Xander Schauffele, 15/1, $9,600 DraftKings
Tony Finau, 20/1, $10,200 DraftKings
Marc Leishman, 20/1, $9,900 DraftKings
Pat Perez, 20/1, $9,400 DraftKings
Patrick Reed, 25/1, $9,500 DraftKings
Once again the books and DraftKings do you no favors on finding value towards the favorites. Tournament favorite Justin Thomas has odds that are a little more reasonable than the ridiculous 4/1 he went off at last week. After a slow start at the CIMB he registered a 69-67 weekend to finish strong, so maybe he came out flat in his first tournament back since a tremendous late Summer. I still don't like the 7/1 odds on him, but for matchup plays or to build your DraftKings lineup around him, it's doable given some of the values that can be found.
I was feeling pretty sick about hitching my wagon on Paul Casey after his opening round 77 last week. But he proved why golf handicapping is incredibly difficult. We have much more access to golfers than our dad's did, yet we still have absolutely no idea what shape they'll show up to a golf course at. Maybe he was jet lagged. Maybe he ate some weird street meat from a Kuala Lumpur market that had him searching for the nearest bush to, well, you know. But whatever it was, Casey went 63-69-65 to backdoor a Top 10. Again, 9/1 are bad odds on a guy who hasn't won on the PGA Tour since 2009. But could I see him continue this hot streak to win in South Korea? Absolutely. If you placed a big bet on him at those odds, I wouldn't knock you for it.
If I had to make bet on the tournament winner from this group, though, I like Tony Finau at 20/1. I've long liked his game and feel this is the season he really breaks out. He finished 2nd at the Safeway Open a few weeks ago and is a ball striking machine. In 2017 he ranked 10th in Strokes Gained Tee to Green, 5th in Par 5 Birdie or Better % and 17th in Greens in Regulation %. He's on the verge of breaking through for a signature win on the PGA Tour, and this week might be his chance.
One guy I'm avoiding and hedging against is Jason Day. I'm a big fan of his game but it's just not in tip top shape at the moment. He started to show some signs of life in the FedEx Cup, but even when he was in contention his Greens in Regulation stats weren't where they should be to compete for the win. If he's missing greens this weekend he'll be in a world of hurt, as he'll find himself either at the bottom of an 8 foot pot-bunker or, worse, at the bottom of a lake. If he does manage to find the putting surface, he could post low scores in a hurry as he is considered a bentgrass green specialist, which is the what the green complexes at Nine Bridges is composed of. But nothing about his form the last few months gives me an impression he can avoid trouble around the green. Best to avoid until he starts to show better form.
Other Contenders:
Gary Woodland – 40/1, $8,300 DraftKings
I'm going back to the well with this guy after he was one of my picks to win last week. He started off well by firing an opening round 66, but the rest of his weekend was fairly pedestrian. I still like his high Greens in Regulation and Par 5 birdie or better rates, and he has the length to hit it over fairway hazards for short irons into the greens. If I liked his odds last week at 30/1, I certainly like them at 40/1 against a comparable field. He should be a solid guy in your DraftKings lineup, a value Win bet or a Top 10 bet this weekend.
Kyle Stanley – 60/1, $7,200 DraftKings, Lucas Glover – 65/1, $7,800 DraftKings, Bud Cauley, 70/1, $7,400 DraftKings
Kyle Stanley and Lucas Glover make a return as middle of the road guys I like this weekend. Glover was solid all four rounds at the CIMB to score a Top 10 finish. Stanley also had a solid performance, but like most weeks his putter really let him down. Both guys are tremendous ball strikers and hit greens at a high rate. Each should be able to avoid the big number to post a solid performance at the CJ Cup.
As for Bud Cauley, he disappointed last week in Malaysia after posting a Top 10 at the Safeway Open the week before. Who knows what exactly went on, but I anticipate a better performance from him this weekend. In 2017, Cauley ranked 25th in Strokes Gained Tee to Green, 9th in Strokes Gained on Approach and 38th in Greens in Regulation %. He's a cheap option for DraftKings that might go unnoticed by the rest of the contest and pay dividends for you.
Harold Varner III – 100/1, $7,200 DraftKings, Hudson Swafford – 125/1, $7,300 DraftKings
Here's a pair of long shots that might serve well in the matchup market or long Top 20 plays. Each of these guys hit greens at a high rate in 2017 and had solid Strokes Gained Approach stats. Both are coming off good weekends at the CIMB (save for Swafford's 78 turd burger in the Round 2), and given all the unknown variables at play this weekend their solid tee to green play could pay off for you.
Chad Campbell – 225/1, $7,100 DraftKings
Feeling bold? Why not put a few smackaroons down on a Top 20 finish for this career underachiever. Campbell was once regarded as a potential rival to Tiger Woods in the mid-2000's but never fully lived up to his hype. He's turned into more of a grinder on the PGA Tour, struggling every year to keep his card. Last week at the CIMB he tanked the first two rounds, but responded strongly by posting a 66-69 weekend. Despite journeyman status on tour, he ranked very well in Strokes Gained Tee to Green, Strokes Gained on Approach and Greens In Regulation % in 2017. If he can continue to perform well in these areas this weekend he could be a surprise top finisher when it's all said and done.
Sample DraftKings Lineup:
Paul Casey – $11,600
Ollie Schniederjans – $8,600
Gary Woodland – $8,300
Kyle Stanley – $7,200
Harold Varner III – $7,200
Chad Campbell – $7,100
Hagel Would Be First Former Enlisted Soldier To Run Pentagon
Enlarge this image toggle caption Paul J. Richards/AFP/Getty Images Paul J. Richards/AFP/Getty Images
Former Republican Sen. Chuck Hagel of Nebraska is said to be on President Obama's short list to be the next defense secretary. But even the possibility of his nomination has stirred up opposition — particularly from members of his own political party.
If Hagel can survive a political ambush in Washington, he would be the first Pentagon chief who saw combat as an enlisted soldier.
The blunt-spoken Hagel favors deeper cuts in military spending and is wary of entangling America in long overseas missions.
In January 2007, Democrats on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee were fighting President Bush's plan to send more troops to Iraq. Hagel was the only Republican to join them, and he blasted those who refused to take a stand.
"Why are you elected?" Hagel asked. "If you wanted a safe job, go sell shoes. This is a tough business. But is it any tougher, us having to take a tough vote, express ourselves, and have the courage to step up, than what we're asking our young men and women to do? I don't think so."
Lessons From Vietnam
Hagel knew better than most what America was asking of its young men and women. Forty years earlier he'd fought in Vietnam with his brother Tom.
They served in the same unit. On patrol one morning in 1968, Chuck was hit by shrapnel in the chest, and Tom rushed to help him. A month later, Chuck saved Tom, pulling him from a burning vehicle. Between them the two brothers earned five Purple Hearts.

Hagel sat down with NPR last May and recalled 1968 in Vietnam.
"That was the year we sent back more than 16,000 young Americans dead. But I think of those special quiet heroes who served, who came back, and never expected anything in return for their service except maybe a little respect," said Hagel.
Hagel came back still a supporter of the Vietnam War, but over time he learned that President Johnson was privately calling the war unwinnable.
"He investigated some of the tapes, Lyndon Johnson tapes, you know, and what had been said and done behind the scenes," says Charlyne Berens, who wrote a biography of Hagel and teaches at the University of Nebraska. "And that really began to make him question the validity of the war and make him much more skeptical if not cynical about the way it was prosecuted."
Hagel brought that skepticism to the Senate and to debates about Iraq and Afghanistan.
The question now is how Hagel's Vietnam experience might shape his advice to the president if he's chosen to lead the Pentagon.
Criticism Over Israel, Iran
Even the rumor that Hagel might be nominated inspired a campaign to block him. Republicans and supporters of Israel accuse him of being anti-Israel and soft on Iran. Hagel as a senator voted against sanctions on Iran, though now he says sanctions should be ratcheted up. Still, he's not seen as tough enough.
"If you have somebody there who's already made it clear that he does not want to engage in a confrontation with Iran, what kind of negotiating leverage do we have?" asks Eliot Cohen, an adviser to President George W. Bush. "You want to have as secretary of defense somebody who's the heavy. Somebody who's the guy who looks as if he's perfectly capable of waging war against you and happy to do it. That's just kind of elementary negotiating tactics."
Hagel is fighting to keep the possibility of his nomination alive. He apologized last week for opposing an openly gay appointee to be an ambassadorship back in 1998. Gay-rights groups criticized him for that stand.
And Hagel appears willing to see another confrontation over a Pentagon budget he calls bloated. In an interview with the Financial Times last year, Hagel said: "I think the Pentagon needs to be pared down. I don't think that our military has really looked at themselves strategically, critically in a long, long time."
That comment came after $500 billion in Pentagon cuts. In the same interview, Hagel said President Obama should have backed the Simpson-Bowles report that called for deeper federal spending cuts.
"If the president had done that," Hagel said. "I believe it would have eliminated all the nonsense."
Hagel's biographer, Berens, says "nonsense" is one of Hagel's favorite words. "Something will come along and he'll say, 'That's just nonsense.' "
It's a word many admirals and generals might hear a lot, if former Army Sgt. Chuck Hagel arrives at the Pentagon.
We talk a lot about the arthouse here at The Magic Lantern, but we have an unabashed love of the grindhouse as well, and this film is a stone classic in that regard. Master of the Flying Guillotine (1976) is one of those all-time great, you have to see it to believe it genre film experiences. If you are of a certain age (forget pre-internet, we are talking pre-cable television here), you may have been lucky enough, as I was, to grow up in a market that had a veritable cornucopia of UHF choices. Among that rich vein of programming was Saturday afternoon Kung Fu Theater and it blew a hole in my pre-adolescent brain. It arrived at the critical juncture when I was graduating from Saturday morning cartoons (when they still had those) to Saturday afternoon schlock. But it was more to me than that. Yes, the films are often cheaply and quickly made, but I see this as a virtue for a number of reasons: First, the law of averages is definitely on our side here. When filmmakers in any genre are so prolific, the occasional masterpiece is all but guaranteed. Second, as often happens, necessity is the mother of invention and the majesty and wonder that some of these films achieve on a shoestring puts much more expensive productions to shame. And third, like any genre worth it's salt, these films create a world and language all their own. Leave your biases and preconceived notions at the door and embrace the insane Foley work, questionable dubbing, and otherworldly acrobatics that await you in the world of Kung Fu cinema!
What you'll find in this episode: Ericca fills out her Kung Fu bingo card, xenophobia among Asian cultures, rooting for the bad guy, and how genre films often reflect our anxieties, whether they mean to or not.

The highly-anticipated demand letter written on behalf of a former Uber employee, which has become central to the unfolding drama that is the Waymo v. Uber trade secrets lawsuit, was publicly released on Friday afternoon.
As previewed in earlier court hearings, the "Jacobs Letter" outlines in detailed terms the questionable and possibly illegal behavior that former Uber security official Richard Jacobs and his former colleagues engaged in during his 11-month tenure at the company.
This letter, which was only recently shared with lawyers involved in the lawsuit and the judge overseeing the case, ultimately led to federal prosecutors opening a criminal investigation into Uber, which is still ongoing.
Waymo v. Uber began back in February, when Waymo sued Uber and accused one of its own former employees of stealing 14,000 files shortly before he left Waymo. The former employee, Anthony Levandowski, went on to found a company that was quickly acquired by Uber. Levandowski refused to comply with his employer's demands during the course of this case and has since been fired. Uber has denied that it benefited in any way from Levandowski's actions.
The outcome of the case will likely determine which company will end up ahead in the cutthroat and rapidly-growing autonomous vehicle sector.
Among other explosive claims, the Jacobs Letter specifically says that two named high-level Uber employees, including Craig Clark, a since-fired Uber lawyer and Mat Henley, who still works at Uber and recently testified in court, orchestrated this scheme.
The men "led Uber's efforts to evade current and future discovery requests, court orders, and government investigations in violation of state and federal law as well as ethical rules governing the legal profession. Clark devised training and provided advice intended to impede, obstruct, or influence the investigation of several ongoing lawsuits against Uber and in relation to or contemplation of further matters within the jurisdiction of the United States."
The letter also contains detailed allegations of abuse of the attorney-client privilege. At one point Clark allegedly ordered that "double secret A/C priv" (short for "double-secret attorney-client privilege") be written on a document as a way to shield it from being disclosed in ongoing or future lawsuits.
This, as many lawyers on Twitter noted, is not a real legal term.
If you invoke double-secret attorney-client privilege, it cancels the first privilege out. Little known in-house secret. https://t.co/sOZh9lDKrU — Feliz Navi-JJ (@J_Dot_J) December 15, 2017
In addition, the Jacobs letter describes what it calls "illegal wiretapping" of a phone call discussing an internal report of sexual harassment. Earlier this year, Susan Fowler , a former Uber engineer, came forward with her experience of such abuse, which ultimately lead to the ouster of then-CEO Travis Kalanick.
Another section of the letter describes the use of a "new technical capability" by "CIA-trained case officers" that Uber contracted with. In 2016, these people allegedly "collected mobile-phone metadata either directly through signal-intercept equipment, hacked mobile devices, or through the mobile network itself. The information eventually shared with Jacobs and others included call logs, with time and date of communications, communicants' phone numbers, call durations, and the identification of the mobile phone subscribers. The subsequent link-analysis of this metadata occurred on U.S. soil."
The 37-page demand letter, which was filed by a Minnesota attorney on Jacobs' behalf, was essentially a warning that Jacobs may sue the company.
Rather than go to court over his claims, Uber ended up paying Jacobs $4.5 million, and his lawyer, Clayton Halunen, $3 million.
In a recent court hearing, Angela Padilla, Uber's deputy general counsel, testified that this letter was "extortionate," but noted that going to court would have cost the company far more. (Halunen has not responded to Ars' request for comment.)
In another court filing submitted on Friday, outside court-appointed advisor Special Master John Cooper determined that this Jacobs Letter should have been made available to Waymo much earlier than part of the civil discovery process.
The revelation of the letter's existence, which only became known late last month, resulted in the trial being postponed a second time.
The trial is now scheduled for early February 2018 in San Francisco, just blocks from Uber headquarters at 1455 Market St.
UPDATE 11:27pm ET: Late Friday evening Ars received an unsolicited e-mail from David Satterfield, a media strategist, which read: "Saw your story. Let me know if you have questions." He provided a number of statements pertaining to six current and former Uber employees referenced by name in the Jacobs Letter.
“Ric Jacobs' letter is nothing more than character assassination for cash," Matthew Umhofer, an attorney who represents four current Uber employees mentioned specifically in the letter, wrote in a statement. Those men are Mat Henley, head of global threat operations at Uber ; Nick Gicinto, head of strategic services group at Uber; Jake Nocon, solutions team manager at Uber; and Ed Russo, senior risk and threat analyst at Uber.
"And Jacobs is nothing more than a failed Uber employee who underperformed and got demoted, and then retaliated against his supervisors and colleagues with a letter filled with distortions designed to line his own pockets," Umhofer continued. "Jacobs took the good work my clients did and twisted it into something it wasn't."
There was also a statement from Joe Sullivan, the former chief security officer at Uber, who was recently fired in the wake of the recently-disclosed data breach that affected 57 million people.
“From where I sat, my team acted ethically, with integrity, and in the best interests of our drivers and riders," Sullivan said in the statement.
Satterfield also sent a statement from Mark Howitson, a lawyer for Craig Clark, which said that Clark "acted appropriately at all times." Howitson formerly served as deputy general counsel at Facebook.
Finally, Satterfield also told Ars that none of the six men that he provided statements for would be answering questions at this time. He also clarified that he is not a spokesman for them, however, and was simply "assisting Joe Sullivan and his legal team. They asked me to coordinate with these other folks."
ISLAMABAD: Investigators of what is now being termed as the ‘Ayyan money smuggling case' are confident of the Pakistani supermodel's conviction in the money smuggling case, but there are doubts that any other ‘big fish' will be netted during the course of investigation.
Customs Preventive and Inland Revenue Intelligence officials recently gave separate briefings to Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) Chairman Tariq Bajwa on the Ayyan Ali case. The chairman was informed about the overall breakthroughs made during the investigation process.
Customs Preventive in its briefing presented it as a simple case of currency smuggling, claiming that the department could easily prove the charges. However, Customs Preventive denied that supermodel Ayyan's arrest could help in any ‘big revelation'.
On the other hand, Inland Revenue officials in their briefing to Tariq Bajwa claimed that the case could help unveil some big names of tax evaders and those who had accumulated black money.
FBR Chairman Tariq Bajwa praised both departments and assured the officials that no interference from the high-ups will take place in this case.
He directed them to hold an independent, free and fair investigation into the case, and solve it on merit. He also directed the Inland Revenue to continue the investigation process, but warned against taking action against the accused until the investigators come by any solid evidence in this case.
So from time to time I find the need to make lookups fast. Usually it is a result of importing a huge csv file or something.
This post is about making lookups in arrays as fast as possible. The array can have may properties or few, it really does not matter. The only thing required is something unique that identifies each row of data.So from time to time I find the need to make lookups fast. Usually it is a result of importing a huge csv file or something.
Sample data
(sample data script)
First we have to create some dummy sample data which we can run some tests against. We will create an array of 10001 objects with a few properties. The unique property that identifies each row is called ID:
How to test performance?
There are a couple of items that impact performance in Powershell. For instance running a Measure-Command expression will yield quite different results. Normally the first run is slower than the second one and then the standard deviation is quite large for consequent runs. To decreate the standard deviation, I use a static call to the .net GarbageCollector with [gc]::Collect(). I feel that the results are more comparable with this approach.
First contender Where-Object
We are going to run 11 different queries and find 2 unique elements in the array. The time measured will be ticks. I have created an collection of IDs which we will use when we query the data ($CollectionOfIDs):
(Measure the Where method)
That is about 85ms on average to query the collection for two unique IDs. baseline ready.
There are two ways you can query an array with the Where keyword. You can pipe the array to the Where-Object cmdlet or you can use the Where method on the array. The where method will always be faster that the cmdlet/pipline approach since you save moving the objects through the pipeline. For our test, we will therefor use the where method as the base which we measure the performance against.We are going to run 11 different queries and find 2 unique elements in the array. The time measured will be ticks. I have created an collection of IDs which we will use when we query the data ($CollectionOfIDs):That is about 85ms on average to query the collection for two unique IDs. baseline ready.
There is a fast knock at the door
First we need to create a hashtable representation of the $csvObjects collection/array. That should be pretty straight forward. We let the unique identifier (ID) become the key and the object itself the value:
(hashtable of csv)
Now I know you have a question. What is the performance penalty of converting that array to a hashtable? Good question and I am happy you asked. It converts the 10000 objects into an hashtable in apx 53 milliseconds:
I would say that is a small price to pay.
Using the same ($CollectionOfIDs) as we did for the where method, let's run the same test against the hashtable:
(Measure the hashtable)
Okay, so the first one is quite slow about 11ms, however it improves quite dramatically to 0.038ms. I use the average numbers (in ticks) to be fair, we have increased the performance with a factor of 649 (837265 / 1289).
We have a new contender and he calls himself Hashtable. He claims he can do even better that 85ms on average. Challenge accepted.First we need to create a hashtable representation of the $csvObjects collection/array. That should be pretty straight forward. We let the unique identifier (ID) become the key and the object itself the value:Now I know you have a question. What is the performance penalty of converting that array to a hashtable?

It converts the 10000 objects into an hashtable in apx 53 milliseconds:I would say that is a small price to pay.Using the same ($CollectionOfIDs) as we did for the where method, let's run the same test against the hashtable:Okay, so the first one is quite slow about 11ms, however it improves quite dramatically to 0.038ms. I use the average numbers (in ticks) to be fair, we have increased the performance with a factor of 649 (837265 / 1289).
Implications
I have only tested this on WMF 5.1 (5.1.14393.103). To use the Where query method on arrays, you need version 4 or later. Converting the collection to an hashtable will give you the ability to perform super fast queries. If you are querying a collection frequently, it makes sense to use hashtable.
Code for speed if you need it, otherwise write beautiful code!

- An unemployed Polk County man admitted to making $7 billion in fraudulent online payments, but said he did it because Jesus Christ created wealth for him, according to court records.
Investigators interviewed John Michael Haskew in December after a payment processing company noticed large payments being made to a bank account from a "large, nationally renowned financial institution." Those payments totaled around $7 billion, which were paid to the account over a two-day period.
Detectives tracked Haskew using the IP address, which was linked to the account with the payment processing company, to his home in Lakeland.
Haskew told investigators he was "self-taught" in the banking industry and taught himself how to make the transactions. Detectives say he admitted to making transfers totaling around $3 billion.
Haskew said he had a very good reason for carrying out the scheme.
According to court documents Haskew said, "that Jesus Christ created wealth for everyone. Using this scheme, Haskew believed that he could obtain the wealth that Jesus Christ created for him and that belonged to him."
The logic was not good enough for state and federal attorneys, however.
Haskew pleaded guilty to making false or fraudulent statements to a department or agency of the United States, which carries a maximum of fiver years in prison and fine of $250,000.
A new white paper from the Factom team outlines a conceptual framework for a system that secures and proves the authenticity of records, documents or other important types of data that are later enshrined on the bitcoin blockchain.
The concept of using the blockchain to cryptographically prove the ‘truth' of a piece of information is one of the cornerstones of the crypto 2.0 movement, and the concept itself has been implemented in the past.
Factom, however, proposes a new architecture that exists outside of the bitcoin network, but relies on the digital currency's globally distributed computing power to keep cryptographically secured information both transparent and globally accessible.
The white paper, written by Paul Snow, Brian Beery, Jack Lu, David Johnston and Peter Kirby, explores an infrastructure in which record keeping – particularly records of ownership – can be moved from a fragmented, primarily manual process to a more digital, automated framework.
A number of well-known reviewers, including Ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin and bitcoin mining expert and developer Luke Dashjr, were cited in the paper.
Avoiding blockchain bloat
Factom envisions a peer-to-peer network in which top-level servers build data chains and, after cryptographically processing the information, enshrines them on the bitcoin blockchain using a Merkle root.
The benefit of this approach, the authors say, is that it takes advantage of bitcoin's cumulative processing power while avoiding the overaccumulation of data – known more commonly as ‘blockchain bloat'.
Factom argues that its concept is a solution to situations such as the mortgage claim crisis that took place in the aftermath of the Great Recession in the US.
At the time, originally paper-based titles were mishandled or lost during digital transitions and, as a result, homeowners from a number of states were incorrectly foreclosed and, to this day, thousands of those affected continue to face legal challenges because the chain of title was effectively broken.
Near-term applications, according to the Factom team, include providing a mechanism for improving transparency among existing players in the bitcoin space. Peter Kirby, who serves as Factom's president, noted during a Reddit Ask Me Anything (AMA) session that his team is already undertaking discussions with interested parties who are looking at his firm's infrastructure as a potential solution to their problems.
He explained:
“Making exchanges honest is one of the first projects that's being done on Factom. You can run a proof-of-audit on steroids – letting you produce a true audit trail of every transaction at every moment. That'll really get businesses to sit up and notice. The other application that will pop up right away is title records – because they secure such a large portion of a country's wealth.”
While the paper acknowledges that some elements are still under development, including the protocol by which the architecture achieves consensus, the Factom concept constitutes another approach to expanding the capabilities of the bitcoin network.
Multi-layer infrastructure
According to the proposal, the Factom system will ultimately consist of a four-tier architecture designed to both produce verified chains of information and secure that data within the bitcoin blockchain.
This infrastructure is responsible for verifying ownership of ‘entry chains', updating the data when changes to chains are made and, at the end of the process, embedding information onto the bitcoin blockchain.
As shown in the diagram below, the proposal calls for the scaled creation of hashed data strings called ‘entry blocks', which are managed by the Factom infrastructure and constructed into chains.
The paper explains:
“Chains in Factom are sequences of Entries that reflect the events relevant to an Application. These sequences are at the heart of Bitcoin 2.0. Chains document these event sequences and provide an audit trail recording that an event sequence occurred. With the addition of cryptographic signatures, those events would be proof they originated from a known source.”
In order to power this network, Factom plans to deploy a P2P network of nodes that act as global mechanisms for keeping the system running and efficiently processing Chain updates. Fueling the top-level system will be in-house tokens known as factoids that will be exchanged for Entry Credits that are then used to input data into the system.
Co-author Paul Snow told CoinDesk that the Factom team is designing its infrastructure to handle high transaction volume and that the architecture itself will be comprised of both full nodes containing systemic data and partial nodes that only carry information for certain chains.
Snow continued:
“The Factom node network will be completely distributed, just like bitcoin. Users will be able to run either a full node replicating all the data … or a partial node replicating only the data needed in specified chains. We are looking at incentives to ensure that data is replicated across the nodes, but all the data does not need to be in every single node.”
Potential applications
The Factom team suggested that its proposal could be leveraged to execute some of the crypto 2.0 functionalities that are beginning to take shape on the market today. These include creating trustless audit chains, property title chains, record keeping for sensitive personal, medical and corporate materials, and public accountability mechanisms.
During the AMA, the Factom president was asked how the technology could be leveraged to shape the average person's daily life.
Kirby responded:
“Factom creates permanent records that can't be changed later. In a Factom world, there's no more robo-signing scandals. In a Factom world, there are no more missing voting records. In a Factom world, you know where every dollar of government money was spent. Basically, the whole world is made up of record keeping and, as a consumer, you're at the mercy of the fragmented systems that run these records.”
Follow-up comments focused on the legal implications of creating a system by which titles can be cryptographically proven to both exist and be tied to a certain date and time. The team repeatedly invoked the robo-signing scandals, pointing to that crisis as the catalyst for the creation of trustless title chain networks.
Kirby suggested at one point that at least one governmental body, as well as private interests, has established contact and is interested in what the proposal has to offer in terms of potential solutions to problems with legacy title management schemes.
“We've already had a country reach out to us about building a title application using Factom and the bitcoin blockchain,” he said.
Development continues
Several elements of the Factom protocol, as well as mechanisms for incentivizing the node structure, remain in development. Yet, according to the team, the release of the white paper – along with the latest version of the API and a frequently-asked-questions sheet – are intended to spark a conversation that could produce additional insights into how Factom might develop moving forward.
During the AMA, Kirby revealed that the decentralized cloud storage platform Storj, which raised 910 BTC during a crowdsale in August, is weighing whether or not to utilize Factom as a record-keeping mechanism.
Kirby called Storj founder Shawn Wilkinson, who serves as an advisor to the Factom project, an early supporter who “knew about Factom before it was cool”.
The scale of Factom, according to Snow, is also expected to grow, both as the project initially takes shape and in the future. These changes, he told CoinDesk, are incumbent on transaction volume and could require larger servers and a broader node network to handle the data flow.
The Factom team, in both its white paper and during the AMA, suggested that the project could evolve as more developers bring ideas to the table for utilizing the system.
Ultimately, the team writes, the goal is to try to develop a vehicle for the solutions offered by the bitcoin protocol to be brought to market without creating impediments to the healthy growth of the network itself.
As the paper states:
JoAnn Windholz (Facebook)
Tuesday morning few people knew of JoAnn Windholz, the Colorado Republican state representative from Commerce City.
By Tuesday afternoon, she had made headlines nationwide after The Colorado Independent reported that she had blamed Planned Parenthood, and apparently not the shooter, for inciting the rampage on its Colorado Springs clinic last week.
Windholz, a first-term legislator, defeated incumbent Democrat Rep. Jenise May for the House District 30 seat in November, 2014. Windholz won by just 106 votes.
Her key priorities, according to her website, are education, healthcare, energy, and job creation and economic growth. Opposition to abortion or Planned Parenthood aren't listed in those key priorities, nor are they included in her website's section on important issues.
In fact, you won't find the words “pro-life,” “anti-abortion” or even “family values” anywhere on her website.
But those values play an important role in who she is.
In her first session, Windholz sponsored four bills, two which made it to the pen of Gov. John Hickenlooper. Those included a bill banning the sale of powdered alcohol and another that amended a state corporations act to allow electronic signatures.
Windholz kept her strong positions on abortion to herself during her first year in office. The only time the public was given a hint was in her co-sponsorship of an anti-abortion bill early in the session, HB 1112. That bill, sponsored by Rep. Lois Landgraf, R-Fountain, would require doctors who perform late-term abortions to take all medically-appropriate steps available to “preserve the life of a born-alive infant” who had been aborted.
After her Tuesday remarks blaming Planned Parenthood for the attack, what seems most strange about her voting record is the long list of anti-abortion bills she did not sponsor.
Windholz's website listed a number of “bills of consequence” tied to the abortion issue, including Senate Bill 15-268, by Senate President Bill Cadman, R-Colorado Springs, a fetal homicide bill which Democrats said would have created a personhood statute in Colorado. Windholz wasn't a sponsor.
Another bill, HB 1041, would have defined life as beginning at conception. Windholz didn't attach her name to that one, either.
Finally, Windholz wasn't on the list of co-sponsors on HB 1162, which would prohibit sex-selective abortions.
She did co-sponsor 11 bills on economic development and first responder issues, ten of which the governor signed.
So where does her opposition to Planned Parenthood stem from?
Windholz is a past president of Crusade for Life Colorado, according to her LinkedIn profile.
The national organization was founded by Donald Smith, who produced the gruesome 1983 anti-abortion documentary “Silent Scream.”
Her leadership with the Crusade for Life Colorado is not mentioned on her website or two Facebook pages, all of which are silent about what she does outside of her role as a lawmaker.
Windholz has kept her anti-abortion views close to the vest, so her remarks this week came as a surprise to some in her district. But they weren't a surprise to former opponent May, who told The Colorado Independent Windholz expressed “strident” opposition to abortion in an October 2014 campaign debate hosted by 9 to 5 Colorado.
But outside of that, Windholz was pretty much silent on the issue, May said.
Similarly, in that 2014 low-key election, her campaign finance reports don't show contributions from known anti-abortion organizations. Her biggest individual donors? Rep. Kevin Priola, R-Henderson, and his wife, Michelle; and now state GOP party chair Steve House.
Her largest campaign donation of $2,000 came from the Colorado Medical Society, the state's largest physician organization. Calls and emails to the society's lobbyist and CEO were not returned.
During the campaign, Windholz completed a survey for the Colorado Family Institute, which promotes Christian values on family, marriage, religious freedom and education.That survey asked for her position on the 1973 Supreme Court Roe v. Wade decision that legalized abortion, which she said she opposed. A second question asked her position on whether abortion providers should make ultrasounds available to women seeking an abortion, which she said she supported.
Her under-the-radar approach on the issue appears to have ended when the Center for Medical Progress released its videos earlier this year.
Windholz was one of 22 House Republican signatories to an August letter to Dr. Larry Wolk of the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment. That letter asked Wolk to investigate whether Colorado Planned Parenthood facilities violate state or federal laws specifically related to the Center for Medical Progress videos. She later attended the all-day November 9 hearing, held by the Republican Study Committee of Colorado, an unofficial body of the legislature's most conservative members. Windholz told The Independent Monday she was only there during the afternoon portion of the hearing.
Windholz's comments on the Planned Parenthood shooting have stunned some in her community.
John Myers of Commerce City is one of two Democrats who have filed to challenge Windholz for the November 2016 election.
He said Tuesday that in the wake of such unimaginable horror, many are left to ask “why” and seek answers. “What we cannot do is blame the victims” as Windholz did. Words matter, Myers said, and her words show that she does not represent the overwhelming majority of the people of House District 30.
Democrat Dafna Michaelson Jenet, who also has filed to run against Windholz, lives in the same north Commerce City neighborhood. She's spoken to Windholz several times since deciding to run.
“I was rendered speechless and frankly a little sick,” Michaelson Jenet told The Independent today. “It was a side of her I had not seen in public. I wouldn't have guessed she made that statement.”
Many people in the district have economic need, and Planned Parenthood serves that need, Michaelson Jenet said, particularly in the rural parts of the district near Aurora where access to healthcare may be limited. In response to Windholz's remarks, Michaelson Jenet issued a statement of her own Tuesday, expressing support and sympathy for the victims of the Planned Parenthood shooting as well as for Planned Parenthood itself.
Windholz filed to run for re-election for her House District 30 seat last August. When called for comment today, she hung up on this reporter.

Perhaps by the sheer force of its market power alone, Samsung immediately became one of the top contenders in the nascent virtual reality space earlier this year when it announced Gear VR — a headset powered by Samsung's Note 4 smartphone, built in conjunction with Oculus. We haven't heard much about the future of the Gear VR since it was announced, but Samsung appears poised to break its silence at its second annual developers conference, which kicks off today in San Francisco. VR will be a major topic of conversation, and the company is counting on those developers to help build the case for the Gear VR — and virtual reality in general.
"For virtual reality to really cross into the mainstream, it's gotta be more than just really awesome, killer games," Samsung's VR vice president Nick DiCarlo says. "What is the most important use case in VR? We haven't figured it out yet, but there are lots of ideas." DiCarlo thinks video games and immersive video are the obvious places for VR to start, but he's also anticipating a more native use case that couldn't have been imagined before VR hardware and development tools became more commonplace. "What is the Twitter or Instagram of VR?" DiCarlo asks. "By that, I don't mean having tweets in VR or having filtered photos in VR — I mean that it's native to that platform, it's born of that platform and would not have existed without that platform."
Samsung is trying to find the first killer app for VR
Before we find that killer app, however, there's the question of what the Gear VR brings to the table that Oculus hasn't already done on its own. Samsung's scale means the company should excel at getting the hardware in the hands of developers — a crucial step. "[The Oculus] DK2 is still pretty hard to come by in terms of production capacity," DiCarlo notes — but since the Gear VR is based on the Galaxy Note 4, Samsung thinks it won't have trouble getting its hardware out to developers. "It's a big deal to be able to say ‘hey, this is going to exist' and that this is something [developers] are going to be able to buy." Samsung said the Gear VR would ship "this fall," and while DiCarlo declined to give any news on price or availability, he did say they were still on track to deliver it this year.
That's good news for the developers that Samsung says are eager to start coding in virtual reality. "Everybody is really, really thirsty for this," says DiCarlo. "It's an interesting programming challenge and [developers] see new opportunities to do things that weren't possible before." It makes sense — app developers famously got rich in the early days of Apple's App Store, and being one of the developers to crack the code of VR has to be a pretty tempting opportunity.
While Oculus will benefit from Samsung's scale helping to push VR forward, Samsung benefitted greatly from the work Oculus has been doing in the last few years. "It's fairly easy to put a phone into a pair of goggles, which gives you a good basic idea of what virtual reality can be, but what Oculus has really delivered is a really high quality VR experience," DiCarlo says. He credits that experience to the motion-to-photon latency of 20 milliseconds that Oculus can deliver: "it means if you turn your head, the light that you expect to see is coming off the screen." It sounds simple, but it's key to make things feel realistic rather than vomit-inducing.
"We're still doing all the hard work of making VR sufficiently compelling for people to try."
Of course, all this technology and developer interest is meaningless if it doesn't effectively lead to a product that consumers want to buy. As with most other VR makers, DiCarlo and Samsung are urging patience — there's no word on when Gear VR will be a consumer-ready product, and DiCarlo readily admits that "we're still doing all the hard work of making VR sufficiently compelling for people to try, and we're still in the early days of that." There's also the very real problem that Gear VR is currently designed for a single handset. DiCarlo called the Note 4 the minimum hardware needed for a good VR experience, but he couldn't say how the Gear VR headset might adapt to fitting both a Galaxy Note 5 and a Galaxy S6 in the future.
What exactly Samsung plans to do beyond the Gear VR hardware to push virtual reality forward remains to be seen, but we expect the company to share more details tomorrow morning at the keynote of its developer conference. At the very least, we'll hopefully find out where and when developers can buy the Gear VR hardware, and Samsung is hosting nine sessions at the conference to teach developers how to start coding for it.
The sessions are pretty standard, with topics like using the Oculus Mobile SDK and the Unity game engine, creating realistic VR animated video and sound, and how human senses respond to virtual reality — but they should serve the purpose of spurring developers to start building the first great VR apps. "There's a ton of passion and energy for VR amongst our developers," says DiCarlo, "and that's the first step of this long journey."
Three new astronauts joined their Expedition 44 crewmates at the International Space Station (ISS) on Thursday, after successfully completing their journey to the orbiting lab aboard a Russian Soyuz spacecraft. The rocket carrying the astronauts from the United States, Russia and Japan docked with the ISS late Wednesday.
According to NASA, the hatches between the Soyuz TMA-17M spacecraft and the space station opened at 12:56 a.m. EDT. The spacecraft was launched toward the orbiting lab on Wednesday after a recent Russian rocket failure delayed the mission for two months.
“The Soyuz TMA-17M vehicle docked to the International Space Station at 10:45 p.m. EDT, over the ocean near Ecuador,” the U.S. space agency said in a statement early Thursday. The three astronauts aboard the spacecraft were Kjell Lindgren of NASA, Oleg Kononenko of the Russian Federal Space Agency (Roscosmos) and Kimiya Yui of the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA). The trio joined Russia's Gennady Padalka and Mikhail Kornienko, and NASA's Scott Kelly.
According to NASA, some of the cargo flown aboard the Soyuz will be used in research investigations that are either ongoing or planned aboard the space station. The astronauts will use biological sample kits delivered by the spacecraft to obtain samples of blood, saliva or urine.
“The ongoing collection of biological samples from crew members will help scientists determine if immune system impairment caused by spaceflight increases the possibility for infection or poses a significant health risk during life aboard the space station,” NASA said in another statement on Wednesday.
Lindgren, Kononenko and Yui will remain aboard the station until late December, while Kelly and Kornienko, who have been aboard since March 27, will return to Earth in March 2016. Padalka, who also has been aboard since March 27, will return to Earth in September, according to NASA.

The Soyuz spacecraft was launched on schedule from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan to the ISS at 5:02 p.m. EDT on Wednesday. The launch was delayed by nearly two months after an unmanned Russian cargo spacecraft failed to deliver supplies to the ISS crew in April, raising concerns about Russian rockets.
The Progress 59 cargo spacecraft reportedly went out of control in late April, and subsequently burnt up a week later as it was re-entering the Earth's atmosphere.
Earlier this month, a Russian Soyuz-U rocket successfully launched an unmanned cargo spacecraft to the ISS, carrying over 6,100 pounds of food, fuel and supplies.

The area around the village of Dalj (Osijek-Baranja County) near the confluence of the Drava and Danube rivers in eastern Croatia, has yielded a wealth of archaeological material indicating that Dalj was an important area of Celtic settlement in the middle-late Iron Age.
Bronze anthropomorphic figurine with penis and breasts, from the Celtic settlement at Dalj (4th – 3rd c. BC). An almost identical figurine, but portrayed with a torc, has been discovered at Prašník (Trnava reg.) in western Slovakia
In the year 1906 a pair of Celtic (Scordisci) belt buckles were found at the site of a destroyed Celtic necropolis at the Busija site in Dalj. Dating to the 1st c. BC, the buckles are of a specific kind called the Laminci type, the main characteristic of which is their construction, consisting of an iron plate with a button hook on the front side, on which a punctuated bronze sheet was attached with pins (Drnić 2009).
This buckle type was worn by Celtic females, and examples have been found over a wide area among the Celtic and Celto-Scythian (Bastarnae) tribes from Southern Pannonia and Romania to Ukraine (Drnić 2009), as well as Slovenia (Knez 1992:62, T. 65: 1–5), Hungary (Kovacs 1982:145-146), Serbia (Drnić op cit) and Bulgaria (Babeş 1983:207).
The decoration on such buckles generally includes different combinations of double or triple garlands, horizontal and vertical lines, concentric circles, fishbone motives, and spherical bulges. The ornament on the first Dalj buckle fits into this pattern, being decorated with two triple garlands and three spherical ornaments within the circles.
The decoration on the second buckle from Dalj is a unique composition based around a core central symbol. In the corners of the buckle four triple garlands were placed with smaller concentric circles in between (two circles between the central motive and the lower side of the buckle remain visible).
The central decorative composition on the second Dalj buckle is particularly interesting. Consisting of a ‘cross within a circle', the symbol is in fact a ‘Taranis Wheel' which, while not hitherto found on other buckles of the Laminci type, is a common symbol on late Iron Age Celtic artifacts, and is to be found, for example, on numerous Scordisci coin issues from Serbia and Croatia dating from the same period (2nd/ 1st c. BC).

Celtic tetradrachms from the Ribnjacka Hoard (Bjelovar, Croatia) – 2nd / 1st c. BC. Note the Wheel of Taranis in front of the horseman on the reverse.
(After Kos, Mirnik 1999)
In the late Iron Age the multi-spoked Solar Wheel, associated with the Thunder God Taranis, is gradually replaced by a simplified 4 spoke version, depicted on numerous Celtic works of art from this period. It also appears likely that this simplified Taranis Wheel forms the basis for the ‘Celtic Cross' in later Early Christian art.

About this series
This is the first interview in a regular series of interviews with stalwarts of the technology industry. We wanted to highlight many of the unsung heroes of the technology industry, the people and projects that have made huge impacts in our lives as developers and technologists.
Update: 07/Mar/2014
Donalds has informed us that there is an update to the GS collections library (4.2.x). You can find it on their GitHub wiki and via a direct link.
Don Raab – Goldman Sachs and GS Collections
We're really pleased to have Don Raab from Goldman Sachs to open up this series as he and Goldman Sachs have been major contributors to Java and Open Source for many, many years. In particular Don and his team have been responsible for the very popular GS Collections library, one that we use ourselves here in jClarity. So without further ado, let's find out about Don's contributions, motivations behind GS collections and some deep dive details about GS collections itself!
1. Would you like to introduce yourself Don?
My name is Donald Raab. I am a Tech Fellow at Goldman Sachs. I love to code, and also enjoy teaching other developers how to code. I've programmed in 20 different languages over the years, and have been paid to develop in at least 10 of them. My favorite programming language is Smalltalk. My second favorite language is Java using GS Collections. I first learned Java in 1997, and have been programming professionally using Java for the past 13 years. I manage a core team in Goldman Sachs which among other things is responsible for the continued development of GS Collections, a Java Collections Framework which we open sourced in GitHub almost 2 years ago.
2. What would you say is the key benefit for developers of using GS-Collections over the existing java.util Collections package or say Google's well known Guava library? What makes them unique?
Scope and completeness.
GS Collections is a feature-rich collections framework. It started out as a supplement to the Java Collections Framework but has grown to the point where it can be used as a complete replacement for the JCF.
Guava also started out as a supplement to the JCF. It has grown into a feature-rich supplement for all of the standard libraries, not just collections. There's a lot of overlap. Both frameworks add Multimaps, BiMaps, Bags (a.k.a. Multisets) and Immutable Collections. Guava includes utility for I/O, reflection, and EventBuses, which are out of scope for GS Collections. GS Collections includes optimized replacements for Lists, Sets, and Maps which are out of scope for Guava.
Both GS Collections and Guava are more complete and richer in their interfaces than the base JDK Collections library. GS Collections combines a set of collections features and capabilities that you would otherwise only get by adding several Java collections frameworks to your classpath like Apache Commons Collections, Guava, Trove, and Functional Java.
GS Collections includes a rich functional API inspired by the Smalltalk protocol. Any Smalltalker or Ruby programmer should recognize method names like select, reject, collect, detect, and injectInto. Developers familiar with other programming languages might know these as filter, filterNot, map, find, and foldLeft. We've added a lot of other methods over the years that were inspired by our experience with other languages like Ruby, Haskell, and Scala, including groupBy, partition, flatCollect, and zip. We have over 90 methods available on our parent RichIterable interface which most of our types extend.
GS Collections includes optimized replacements for the standard JDK Collections classes like ArrayList, HashSet, and HashMap. We wanted more memory efficient and performant versions of these classes in addition to a rich functional API. We also wanted memory efficient immutable collections and primitive collections.
GS Collections is tuned for both large and small scale performance. We've supported data-level parallelism for years. In the earliest years of the framework, we added parallel utilities using Doug Lea's original version of the Fork/Join framework. When we migrated from Java 4 to Java 5 we switched over to using Executors. We have since revived our usage of Fork/Join by providing a separate forkjoin module. GS Collections supports Java version 5 and above, so we had to add a Java 7 specific module to include support for Fork/Join again.
Here is a list of the feature combinations that I believe sets GS Collections apart in the Java Collections framework space today.

3. How well does GS-Collections work with Java 8 and how does GS-Collections compare to the overhauled collections library in Java 8?
GS Collections works very well today with Java 8 Lambdas and method expressions. Most of the functionality a developer would use from the new Streams API is already available on the GS Collections types. However, our types extend the Java types (for example MutableList extends List) so they inherit the new Streams API. GS Collections has not been tuned for the Streams API yet, like the built-in container types, so the performance characteristics may vary. Java 8 adds just a few new methods to the existing collections interfaces, like forEach(), sort(), and stream(). The remaining new API is on the Stream interface returned by stream(). GS Collections has the equivalent methods right on the collections. For example, the new functionality collection.stream().filter() is already available as collection.select() in GS Collections.
GS Collections has a lot of types you will not find in Java 8, like Bags, Multimaps, Immutable Collections, and Primitive Collections. We also support an eager API by default, as well as a lazy API on request via a call to asLazy(). The Streams API is primarily lazy. Lazy is often a good thing, but can be slower when you want to ultimately get back a collection.
And there is much more… GS Collections has been in development for 10 years, so it has accumulated a lot of functionality not easily found in a single library. We do not shy away from adding new types and new APIs, so GS Collections will continue to evolve and grow. We follow semantic versioning, and will keep deprecated APIs through one major release before removing. We don't remove much these days, but we often add new APIs in major versions. We strive to provide serialization compatibility between releases by leveraging a large battery of serialization tests.
4. Was there any particular inspiration or spark behind the design of the libraries themselves?
In the early days, the design inspiration was from Smalltalk. Later we saw similarities between a lot of our designs and the Scala collections library since Scala 2.8. This was a nice validation of our designs. We have been inspired to add a parallel lazy API to GS Collections since seeing it first in Scala, and now in Java 8. We have eager parallel utilities today, but I believe utility classes are harder to use and discover than an object-oriented API directly available and discoverable on containers.
5. How easy have new recruits to Goldman Sachs found it to pick up the GS Collections library?
We train new hires using the GS Collections Kata. It is the best way to learn the basics of the framework. The Kata is available on GitHub as well. It's set up as a series of unit tests which fail. You can fork the repository, read the training materials, and get the tests to pass. Then you can compare your solutions with our solutions branch. Eventually we hope to have online videos available for the GS Collections Kata so internal and external developers can learn directly from some of our GS Collections contributors and instructors.
6. We haven't seen many banks open source their internal libraries. What motivated Goldman Sachs to open source the GS-Collections library and get involved with the wider Java community?
We use a lot of open source software in Goldman Sachs. We wanted to give something back that we thought would be valuable to the community. We also thought it was important to be part of the discussion that would lead to lambdas finally being added to Java. We have a lot of experience to offer in the use of a lambda ready collections framework solving real business problems. Having GS Collections out in the open has helped us provide valuable feedback and input to the process of adding lambdas to Java 8.
7. We're a performance tuning company, so we're always interested in the performance characteristics of new libraries. What are the performance characteristics of GS-Collections like compared to other collections libraries?
It's easiest to talk about static memory usage. The most dramatic difference is in our implementations of hash tables. GSC's UnifiedMap uses half the memory of the JCF HashMap because it doesn't hold onto Entry objects. GSC's UnifiedSet uses one quarter the memory of the JCF HashSet because it's not implemented by delegating to a Map (wasting memory on values when only the keys are used) plus it also doesn't hold onto Entry objects. Our Multimaps, BiMaps, and Bags are backed by our own hash tables; Guava's are backed by the JCF's HashMap.
It's harder to compare runtime performance. Over the last 10 years of working on GS Collections, I have written lots of really bad micro-benchmark code, and then spent lots of time improving the micro-benchmarks I wrote in the hope of proving that our framework was “fast” or “faster”. This winds up being a bit of a fool's folly in my opinion, as “fast” taken out of an application context can be mostly meaningless. I believe it is better for experts like yourselves to help applications profile and understand “their” code and tune it appropriately.
Our memory optimizations have some positive but difficult to measure effects in terms of performance, because we give the garbage collector a break by not generating garbage unnecessarily. We have memory benchmarks that compare the memory footprints of our containers alongside the equivalent types in the JDK, Guava and Trove. The benchmarks are in the performance-tests module in GitHub. Anyone can run these tests on their own with the latest version of the libraries. We also published slides to the GS Collections GitHub wiki which show a graphical version of the comparisons.
8. Is there any particular programming first-love that you have – for example what first set you on the road to being a developer?
I started programming by teaching myself BASIC on an Epson HX-20 when I was 11 years old. I knew then what I know now – that I would be a developer for the rest of my life. I learned Smalltalk in my 20 something years, and this changed my world-view completely. I then decided that I would not only enjoy coding the rest of my life, but I would teach others to learn how to love to code. I've spent the greater part of the past 10+ years trying to convince Java developers that there is a better, easier way to do things. GS Collections is a part of that story.
9. Anything else you would like to mention?
I hope Java developers discover and give GS Collections a try and enjoy using it as much as I have over the years. Check out the library in GitHub and the documentation and Javadoc available from the GitHub wiki. The binaries are available in Maven Central. The Kata is a great way not just to learn GS Collections, but to also learn how to use Java 8 Lambdas and method references.
The one link that can help you find everything you are looking for in regards to GS Collections is https://github.com/goldmansachs. You will find a project for GS Collections and a project for the GS Collections Kata here.
Thank you for asking me such great questions. I hope folks find the answers and information helpful. If there are any further questions about GS Collections I would encourage folks to ask them on StackOverflow tagged gs-collections, and we'll be happy to answer them.

The fine folks at Stone Blade Entertainment have provided us an exclusive early look at two new cards from their hit digital trading card game SolForge. These cards are coming as part of The Secrets of Solis, the third set for the game so far and one that looks like it will shake the game up quite a bit.
SolForge World Championships Tournament Offers $5,000 Prize Pool, Card Based On Winning Player
The first card we have isNefrax, The Soulweaver. This is a creature from the Nekrum faction and he's a beast. Not only does he have a great amount of health, every turn you can activate him to place a powerful (up to 15 attack 15 health!) ally in an empty space!
Of course, he comes with a cost- in order to play him you will have to destroy one of your creatures. It definitely looks like it will be worth it, though.
Ascension Rise Of Vigil Review: Expansion Reinvents The Popular iOS Card Game In The Best Way
Next up are the Oratek Explosives, a spell from the Alloyin faction. At level one it gives a decent +5 attack to any of your creatures but its real strength is when you place it in the mdidle of an Alloyin/Tempys deck. When it activates its Allied Tempys ability it can really effectively take out enemy creatures when attacking a player, even a whole line of them at level three. And yes, you're seeing right- that's an Allied ability that targets another faction, a feature new to Set 3.
The Secrets of Solis will contain 60 new cards, many of which feature brand-new mechanics to the game. For example there are abilities like Consistent, which means that once a card is leveled it's guaranteed to be in the top 20 cards of your deck when you shuffle; Solbind, which makes a card come with other cards (meaning you can finally have a deck bigger than 30 cards); and Banish, which lets you remove cards from your deck for good! For an example of that latter ability check out the recently revealed Toorgmai Guardian.
The game UI will be updated as well to give you a better idea of how the game plays. As they explain on the official blog, you'll be able to see your discard pile now, which is essential for card abilities that target discarded cards, like Toorgmai's. It also seems like you'll just generally have a better idea of how the game flows, since you'll be able to see how many cards are left in your deck, which ones are leveled up, and even see the discard pile getting shuffled back into the main deck every time you level up. Most people didn't even know that was happening!
Another blog update allows us to meet Forge Guardian Delta, a new card that offers you another way to summon Forge Guardian Omega, possibly the strongest card in the game. Omega could only be summoned by combining all the other Guardians (Alpha, Beta, Gamma), Voltron-like, into one monster, but it was hard to get the necessary five cards out in order to make it happen. Delta makes it a bit easier and Omega itself has been updated and improved with the Consistent ability, meaning that you can plan on seeing a whole lot of Guardian decks being built up after this Set hits.
We here at GameNGuide are really excited to get our hands on these SolForge cards ourselves when The Secrets of Solis drop soon. Expect reduced output on the site as the entire staff gets sucked back into one of the finest card games around.
For more on SolForge check out solforgegame.com.
[UPDATE: An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated that the release date for Set 3 will be next week. There is no official release date yet.]
That's the power of EXO. They break records. They broke the record of most physical albums sold with their first full album, they broke the record for pre-sales with their second album, and now they've broken even more records on theThe boys sold 6,000 copies of their 2nd album '' during the week ending on April 5 in North America, a new feat for a Kpop album. So, what does this mean for them on the charts in combination with their streaming counts?
This means they've established themselves as the highest charting domestic male group to date on Billboard's main music chart, Billboard 200, at #90! As if it that wasn't enough, 'EXODUS' also ranked #70 in the Top Album Sales chart.
For other notable comparisons, Taeyang holds the highest ranked album for a domestic solo male artist with 'Rise' at 112 back in 2014. His labelmate, 2NE1, however, still holds the title of the highest charting Kpop act (male and female combined), debuting at #61 on Billboard 200.
Billboard also mentioned that this is EXO's second consecutive #1 ranking on Billboard's World Albums Chart, and nine of their songs from 'EXODUS' are ranked in the World Digital Songs chart, with their title track "Call Me Baby" ranked at number 2.
Congratulations to EXO and EXO-L's on this achievement!
Nineteen years ago today the second annual Furthur Festival came to Alpine Valley in Wisconsin. The 1997 installment of Furthur featured moe., Sherri Jackson, Bruce Hornsby, Jorma Kaukonen & Michael Falzarano, Arlo Guthrie, Ratdog, Mickey Hart & Planet Drum, Robert Hunter and The Black Crowes. Each show would come to an end with an all-star jam and the one from Alpine '97 was a doozy.
Alpine '97 actually featured a pair of all-star jams. Before The Black Crowes took the stage, Weir led an acoustic performance that saw him team with Rob Wasserman and Dave Ellis on “Artificial Flowers.” Next up was a cover of Bob Dylan's “You Ain't Goin' Nowhere” featuring Bobby, Rob, Bruce, Jorma, Arlo, Michael and Sherri. The mini-set concluded with Wasserman, Weir, Hornsby, Falzarano, Jackson and Al Schnier collaborating on “Friend Of The Devil.” Listen a recording taped by Mark B.:
All of moe. returned to the stage after The Black Crowes' set to back Bob Weir and Bruce Hornsby on “Viola Lee Blues” to start the evening's all-star jam. Next up was Don Nix's “Going Down,” popularized by Jeff Beck, which saw Chris Robinson lead an ensemble that also included other members of The Black Crowes, Jorma Kaukonen, Bruce Hornsby and Bob Weir. The evening's finale was a cover of Bob Dylan's “All Along The Watchtower” featuring Weir and Hornsby along with members of their bands and The Black Crowes. Here's a soundboard matrix recording:
As a bonus, enjoy recordings of Alpine '97 Furthur Festival sets from moe., Mickey Hart & Planet Drum, Robert Hunter and Bob Weir & RatDog:
Many defence ministers pose for photos with military hardware, but few pull off the true badass combat stance as well as Harjit Singh Sajjan — draped in flak jacket and camouflage, gripping an assault rifle on an actual battlefield.
Sajjan was, until recently, a decorated Lieutenant-Colonel in the Armed Forces, the first Sikh Canadian to command an army regiment.
“Command breaks down barriers because no one looks at what you look like when the bullets are flying,” he said in 2011. “Having to carry your, you know, wounded soldiers off the battlefield, not just wounded, but the ones that have been killed and place them into a helicopter, nothing prepares you for that.”
Sajjan, sworn on Wednesday as Canada's new Minister of National Defence, was, in military lingo, “a trigger puller.”
He was deployed to Bosnia-Herzegovina and three times to Afghanistan, for which he was awarded one of the military's highest recognitions, the Order of Military Merit, for reducing the Taliban's influence in Kandahar Province.
“He has a taste for the reality of war and that's very, very important,” said David Bercuson, director of the Centre for Military, Security and Strategic Studies at the University of Calgary.
“He will have seen the aftermath of the effect of war on some of our men and women, which is a major issue with veteran's affairs,” said Bercuson.
Although few details of Sajjan's military service are widely known, his personal story has brought accolades of being a “war hero” and a “trailblazer.”
Now 44, he arrived in Canada from India with his parents at the age of six. His father worked in a mill and his mother picked berries with an eye to supporting their children through school.
He served as a reservist, and was deployed with the Canadian peacekeeping forces to Bosnia in 1996.
In 2006 he served in Afghanistan, playing a key intelligence advisory role to Brig.-Gen David Fraser in the successful Operation Medusa offensive against the Taliban. He returned to Afghanistan in 2009 and 2011.
Rising to the rank of reserve lieutenant-colonel, he was named commander of the B.C. Regiment (Duke of Connaught's Own), in 2012.
Sajjan joined the Vancouver Police Department in 1999. As a detective, he worked in Vancouver's gang squad to help pull kids off the path to a gangster's life.
He took the techniques he learned in B.C. to Afghanistan, to fight recruitment to the Taliban.
He previously said a small team of Canadian soldiers built rapport with locals that yielded crucial intelligence on the Taliban defences.
Sajjan's hands-on combat experience will be appreciated by soldiers, but it also comes with some baggage, said Jack Granatstein, a military historian and fellow of the Canadian Global Affairs Institute.
“His appointment will be cause for enormous joy within the reserves and of substantial concern within the regular force,” said Granatstein.
“There currently is, and there has been for, well, forever, tension between the reserves and the regs,” he said.
There are many measures of a minister, but when it comes to grassroots knowledge of military service, Sajjan replaces Jason Kenney who, before politics, was president of the Canadian Taxpayers Federation. The two ministers before Kenney were both lawyers.
In 2006, Gordon O'Connor, a retired Brigadier-General, was defence minister in a short, unsatisfying tenure.
Prior to O'Connor, Gilles Lamontagne, a bomber pilot in the Second World War who was shot down in 1943 and held as a prisoner of war, was named to the defence portfolio in 1980. The most popular defence minister for many in the military was Barney Danson, who lost an eye in the Battle of Normandy, who was named to Cabinet in 1976.
Both Granatstein and Bercuson said high-ranking military officials often have a hard adjustment to life as a defence minister. Having dodged bullets is not the be-all of what the military wants in a minister.
“A major part of what they will be looking for is how much clout the minister brings to the Cabinet table. Jason Kenney, no doubt, brought a lot of clout,” Granatstein said.

Dion Kaszas has been getting under people's skin for nearly a decade. Now he's helping to foster the revival of Indigenous tattooing practices.
Last year, Kaszas started Earthline Tattoo School with the hopes he could help Indigenous people strengthen connections to their culture.
"We are losing a lot of people because they've decided that they don't want to be with [the community] anymore," he told CBC Daybreak South's Jaimie Kehler.
"I've found that this type of tattooing actually anchors people to their culture and helps them to stay here longer."
Genuine connection
The Earthline school is run by Indigenous artists and only accepts Indigenous students.
For Métis tattoo aficionado Audie Murray, traditional tattooing is a shift from the experiences she's had thus far.
She has a handful of machine-inked tattoos — the kind you can get in any old tattoo parlour — and said she wasn't satisfied with the experience.
"Every time I received a new tattoo I just felt not super connected with the artist or the studio. I was really searching for that connectivity while getting a tattoo," said Murray.
"A really big part of [the tattoo] process is the intimacy of it."
A world of experience
Kaszas specializes in two traditional methods of tattooing: One is stick and poke; the other is skin stitching. He teaches both at Earthline.
Stick and poke involves a single, hand-held needle that pierces the skin and tattoos one dot at a time. With skin stitching, an artist pushes a threaded needle under the skin to, essentially, "make a tunnel filled with ink."
The Earthline school focuses on the safety of tattooing as well as the cultural aspects. Students also take a health and safety course
Dion Kaszan finishes a Chilkat tattoo on guest mentor, Nahaan, at the 2017 Earth Line Tattoo School in Kelowna. (Earthline Tattoo Collective)
Kaszas is of mixed heritage: Hungarian, Metis, Hawaiian and Nlaka'pamux — an Interior B.C. Salish community. He said every community comes with its own tattooing culture.
"Many of the [tattooing] traditions that are represented here were actually outlawed at one time.
Not being allowed to embody who you are on your skin as your ancestors did is actually quite a damaging thing," he said.
Guest artists and mentors are a big part of the weeks-long program because Kaszas feels it's important to represent Indigenous cultures other than his own.
The school has welcomed teachers from British Columbia's Nisga'a, Heiltsuk and Tlingit nations. Artist Pip Hartley came from as far as New Zealand to share Māori tattooing practices.
Amy Malbeuf, an established Métis visual artist from Rich Lake, Alta., is part of the Earthline Tattoo Collective — a group of artists that make the course happen.
Amy Malbeuf uses natural materials like hides and furs in her visual art. She is one of the facilitators at Earthline Collective and has been practicing traditional Indigenous tattooing for a year, (Amy Malbeuf )
Malbeuf hopes to see traditional practices revived by Indigenous people, for Indigenous people.
"I think it's really important for our people to be tattooed by our own people and carry these markings that express our own identity," she said.
"Even though we are visible people, we are still invisible ... I think this is a really great way to assert ourselves."

Rares and her fancy at it's fanciest....whatever...hey look I finally finished something that you guys wanted...look at me hehe...
Anyway, hope you enjoy!
Her eyes swiftly looked back at the clock in town square, and then back at her hooves, and then again at the clock as an endless process to do with her time that wasn't spent talking with one of her business associates.
"There is fashionably late, and then there is just late..." Rarity huffed looking at the clock, then adjusting her hat with a glow of her horn, just enough to get the sun out of her lashes.
"Hmph, I bet he isn't even coming, I should have not even worn one of my best hats for this appointment..." The unicorn was anxious enough with her business booming and the need for "sponsors" so high, but Fancy Pants offering a helping hoof in her business in Canterlot was exhilarating, and made her even more nervous. Sadly, circumstances be, Fancy's timing isn't helping Rarity in the slightest.
"Oh, Rarity, forgive me I'm so poor at time, you see I was just in a meeting with a client..." Finally, Fancy had sat at the table seated across from Rarity, after shaking hooves with the lady.
"What a fine place, and their menu is even more so." Fancy admired the cafe that Rarity had hoof picked for the arrangement.
"Well yes, I really do like this restaurant and it's "chic" feel to it...but perhaps we should find a meal suitable for this meeting before we get into the discussion of your sponsorship, Mr. Fancy, and the restaurants decor." Rarity passed a wink and smiled while lifting her menu to her eyes with her magic.
"Oh yes, of course." Fancy replied back with a small smile. Never has Rarity seen such a stallion that had the same morals and fondness of fashion as her than Fancy. What a gentleman he was, and seemed to a sweep young ponies off their hooves.
The two enjoyed a settle dinner together, both enjoying the luxury of being served delicious horderves and tasty pasta. After which they began to discuss their daily lives and then why Rarity would need such a sponsorship from Fancy, to Fancy's amazement was quite an exquisite dream.
"My dear, with that kind of thinking you'll have your business scattered across Equestria!" Fancy got excited from the idea of seeing Rarity's business on every street corner of Equestria.
"Oh my dear, that's not even the half of it! I wish to have my business all across Gaia!" Rarity giggled at the thought as the waiter came for their bill and tip.
"Oh here..." Rarity pulled out a jewel from her purse and gave it to the waiter gently.
"Here's my share..." Fancy, doing the same, gave to rubies to the waiter.
"I see your also quite generous Mr. Fancy, very admiring..." Rarity batted her eyes softly, seeming to entice Fancy or just from the tiring and busy day she's had.
"Why thank you," Fancy flushed slightly...", I believe a giving heart is a good heart, though it seems you may follow the same value."
"I do actually." Rarity flushed a brighter red than Fancy had once done previously.
"Oh dear, I'm afraid I must go now..." Fancy looked at his watch with a frown,"...this was a very nice evening" Fancy held his hoof out to touch Rarity's, which she held for a long and intimate amount of time.
"Likewise, Mr. Fancy, I'm sure this is to be a grand partnership."
Yay! Done! I hope you guy's liked it! Next is Rainbow, or AJ, I can't remember oh well!
As always,
With Love,

DRM Destroys Value: Why Years Old, But DRM Free, Devices Sell For Twice The Price Of New Devices
from the DRM-protects-who,-exactly? dept
Nothing takes value out of a product faster than DRM. Digital rights management has expanded into places where no "digital rights" should exist. What once was something clumsily inserted to "protect content creators" has now become a catch-all term for anything a manufacturer does to ensure that the end user never truly owns the product they purchased.
A small scanner in a coffee maker ensures you'll never use a competitor's coffee, even though purchasers thought they were purchasing a device rather than being sucked into the undercurrent of a revenue stream. The application of inkjet-esque DRM to a souped-up cat litter box means a $200 purchase will be outperformed by its $5 equivalent should you happen to run out of proprietary cleaning solution.
DRM takes purchases out of purchasers' hands. It nullifies the right of first sale by allowing the company -- not the end user -- to determine how the product will be used.
Public Knowledge's John Bergmayer points out that not only does this screw the customer, but it devalues the product itself.
Back in 2010, I paid $99 for an Apple TV--technically, the Apple TV (2nd generation). Recently, it stopped receiving software updates, so I decided to put it on eBay. I was surprised that I was able to sell a piece of four-year old electronics for $161--it's not often you make a profit on old devices.
The reason for this is simple--tinkerers have figured out how to jailbreak the 2nd generation Apple TV, but not the 3rd gen one, which is the one Apple currently sells (also for $99).
A device that a user can modify, add capabilities to, and freely install software on is more valuable than one where she can't. And people are willing to pay for that capability. Pre-jailbroken Apple TVs are selling for around $230 on eBay right now.
A 2nd-gen Apple TV isn't a collectors item. It's just worth more to people who want something more from their Apple TV than Apple is willing to give them.Despite its name, there's nothing criminal about jailbreaking a device, although plenty of device manufacturers would argue otherwise. Jailbreaking returns control of the purchased device to the purchaser, and certain companies expend far too much capital and effort ensuring they can regain control with the next iteration. These same companies are either unable or unwilling to understand that products a purchaser can control are worth more than those boxed in by DRM.Brand new: $99. Last generation -- jail broken and untethered: more than twice that.Certainly, most of the buying public is happy with dumbed-down devices forever enslaved to their makers. Diehard hobbyists, hackers and fans are a market to be courted, but very few companies do so, no matter how "forward-looking" they claim to be when touting their latest products.Amazon's Fire TV, a direct competitor to Apple's offering, suffers from the same problem, but the company is even more aggressive in its thwarting of jailbreaking. Not only did a firmware update brick rooted devices , it also prevented rollback to earlier firmware versions. What value does that add to the product? What benefit does a purchaser derive from a move clearly meant to lock them into Amazon's ecosystem -- one in which the "purchased" product makes every effort it can to sell them even more stuff?The market is there for goods you can actually OWN. Products are meant to be controlled by the people who purchased them. The insertion of DRM reverses this long-standing relationship, allowing companies topurchasers -- and expecting them to pay (sometimes repeatedly) for the "privilege.".

Image caption The human remains are thought to be that of a young woman
A well-preserved human skeleton which could be 1,000 years old has been uncovered in the grounds of Hillsborough Castle in County Down.
Archaeologists found it during excavation work ahead of a major redevelopment project.
The human remains are thought to be that of a young woman.
They will be removed for further tests that will confirm the gender and age.
Other remains on the site, which is thought to be a burial ground, will be left undisturbed.
Archaeologists are also hoping to find the walls of a medieval church on the site.
'Stories'
Jonathan Barkley from Northern Archaeology Consultancy Ltd said a well-preserved skeleton of this age was an unusual find in Northern Ireland.
"We arrived hoping to find the remains of a 15th or 16th Century church, but about two hours into our first day we uncovered a skeleton," he said.
Image caption The skeleton was found during excavation work ahead of a major redevelopment project
"While it was initially believed to belong to the church we are now thinking it may be about 1,000 years old, so several hundred years earlier."
Historic Royal Palaces (HRP), which runs the estate, has also enlisted the help of volunteers for the dig.
Rosanagh Fuller from HRP said the history that has been uncovered will help tell the story of the site in a new visitors centre which is due to open in 2019.
"It's absolutely fantastic for our stories and for the local community in Hillsborough," she said.
Image caption Archaeologists are also hoping to find the walls of a medieval church on the site
"Where there is a church, there's a burial site and there could be a settlement here.
"We are talking a very long time ago, pre written records.
"It's really exciting to find out more about the Hillsborough village before it was, as we know it, in the Georgian style today."

The following video is an admission by Rosalind Peterson, President of the Agriculture Defence Coalition, who addresses the UN on the truth behind chemtrails, geoengineering, and weather modification.
The acknowledgement by the UN that our skies are being polluted with aluminium, barium, lead, arsenic, chromium, cadmium, selenium, and silver should give weight to the claims that Chemtrails cause a whole host of health problems in the general population, including:
Neurological effects, heart damage, eyesight issues, reproduction failures, immune system damage, gastrointestinal disorders, damaged kidney, damaged liver, hormonal problems, and more.
Humansarefree.com reports:
The truth is the government is spraying deadly chemtrails in hopes of population reduction. Furthermore they have been known to use chemtrails as biological testing agents on the populace; all while claiming they are nothing more than mere vapor.
We'll now we have 100% undeniable evidence that chemtrails exist.
The video below is of Rosalind Peterson, the president of Agriculture Defence Coalition.
In it she addresses the United Nations on chemtrails, geoengineering, and weather modification (HAARP). If you were a skeptic before, I can assure you, that you will not be after hearing what she (the video below) has to say to the people in power.

Will Seattle ever kick its addiction to the car? Transit, zoning and a culture change would need to happen first, FYI Guy explains.
You already know that Seattle is growing like crazy. In fact, with a surge of newcomers, Seattle debuted last year on the list of the 10 most densely populated big cities in the U.S.
What you may not know is that the city has added cars at the same rate as people.
Census data show that from 2010 to 2015, Seattle's population grew by an impressive 12 percent. And the growth in the number of personal vehicles owned by city residents? Also up an impressive 12 percent.
With that increase, our car “population” hit 435,000, all crammed into the city's 84 square miles of land area. That pencils out, in case you're wondering, to 5,185 cars per square mile. If you ranked major U.S. cities by density of cars instead of people, Seattle would place fifth.
Another way to look at it: For every 1,000 city residents, there are 637 cars here. Among the 10 most densely populated big cities, Seattle easily has the most cars per capita — even more than Los Angeles.
There's no getting around it: Compared with other big-city dwellers, Seattleites are a car-dependent bunch. We fret a lot here about turning into the next San Francisco, but when it comes to car ownership, we've got nothing to worry about. The City by the Bay has 160,000 more people than Seattle, but about 50,000 fewer vehicles.
It's not that surprising when you consider Seattle's history, says Mark Hallenbeck, director of the Washington State Transportation Center at the University of Washington.
“Seattle is a relatively new city, so it tends to be built around the car. It was after World War II that most of the major growth took place here,” he said. “A lot of the city is suburban.”
Indeed, about half of Seattle is zoned exclusively for single-family homes, according to the city.
To be fair, there are some signs of change when it comes to car ownership. Back in May, I spoke with Hallenbeck about data showing carless households are now increasing at a faster rate than those with cars, reversing a trend going back many decades. In that sense, at least, Seattle may have passed “peak car.”
But even if car-owning households aren't growing as fast, they're still growing. And so the raw number of cars in the city continues to climb.
More cars mean more traffic. But the problems don't end there. Cars spend a lot more time parked than they do traveling, and there's already a shortage of street parking in many neighborhoods.
Of course, that will only get worse if we continue to add cars at the same rate as people. Requiring developers to include off-street parking in new apartment buildings isn't a good solution. It adds tremendously to the cost of construction, which in turn raises rents — and higher rents are the last thing Seattle needs.
So does continue population growth mean ever more cars in Seattle's driveways, garages and streets?
Hallenbeck thinks at some point that the total number of cars will level off, but we're not there yet.
“It's a function of density and the nature of development that takes place,” he said. “Right now, growth in Seattle is going to bring more cars except in those few areas where owning a car makes no sense.”
In Seattle — unlike, say, New York — the benefits still outweigh the costs and the hassle for many people. And Seattle is an increasingly affluent city. A lot of folks can afford to own a car for convenience and weekend getaways more than out of true necessity.
We are doing a lot of the right things to make more parts of the city less car dependent, like rezoning for greater density in many areas and investing heavily in transit.
No matter your feelings about growth, the city is expected to add 120,000 people over the next 20 years. If most of them show up with cars, it won't be pretty.

At a forum in the International District Wednesday night, Seattle Police announced they have a new plan to solve the murder of a beloved community leader.
The community has been outraged about the lack of answers in the murder of activist Donnie Chin.
Chin, the director of the International District Emergency Center (IDEC), was gunned down in July 2015. Since then his family has been asking for answers
"Donnie didn't deserve to be murdered, he only helped people," Chin's sister, Connie Chin Magorty told the forum, as she fought back tears. "He put his life on the line for us everyday and we won't rest until he has justice."

Seattle Police told the frustrated crowd it's forming a new gang task force which, along with with local and federal agencies, will focus specifically on gang-related murders.
“I think the community is frustrated, they want answers rightfully so,” said Seattle Police Deputy Chief Carmen Best. “We are serious about this case we are not going to let it go, that it is not a cold case, it's still very much an active investigation and that is why we're putting this task force together.”
Police said at least two lead detectives are working on the case everyday.
Detectives are looking at shell casings from other gang shootings to see if they match those used in the Chin case.
Some local lawmakers said they want to know more from the new gang task force and how it can help solve Chin's murder.
"How does this very specifically relate into the investigation of the murder of Donnie Chin," said Rep. Sharon Tomiko Santos, (D - Seattle).
Seattle Police said they would announce more details on the new task force at a later date.
Barely longer than your thumb, weighing under an ounce and nearly translucent, delicate crustaceans known as krill are vital to ocean ecosystems around the world. In the waters that encircle Antarctica, krill are an essential food source for penguins, baleen and blue whales (which can eat as much as 4 tons of krill per day), fish, seabirds, and other marine creatures. The health of these Southern Ocean species depends heavily on healthy krill populations.
But Antarctic krill are also increasingly sought after as a source of food for farmed seafood, livestock and poultry. And although you probably won't find krill on the menu anytime soon, their omega-3 fatty acids and other nutrients have made them popular for human consumption in the form of krill oil. Since 2010 the world catch of Antarctic krill has grown by about 40 percent.
While tiny, krill are considered one of the most abundant species in the world; their combined biomass is estimated to exceed that of all the people on the planet. But even though the supply of krill would seem inexhaustible, scientists are concerned what the combination of fishing and climate change (including ocean acidification) means for Antarctic krill and, in turn, for the entire Antarctic marine ecosystem.
In many ways, these tiny crustaceans are becoming a key factor in thinking about what we choose to eat in a high CO 2 world.For at the same time krill fishing has increased, krill habitat has been disappearing as the Southern Ocean warms — more rapidly than previously thought ­and faster than any other ocean. Krill need both sea ice and cold water. Rising temperatures reduce the growth and abundance of plankton on which krill feed, while loss of sea ice removes habitat that shelters both krill and the organisms they eat. So when Antarctic sea ice declines, so do krill. One recent study suggests that if current warming and increasing CO 2 trends continue, Antarctic krill could lose at least 20 percent — and in some, particularly vulnerable locations, as much as 55 percent — of their habitat by the end of the century.
The nutrients that make krill so important to penguins and other Antarctic wildlife are the same ones that make them attractive for aquaculture, livestock and poultry feed, and human consumption. Many scientists, including marine biologist Rodolfo Werner, adviser to the Pew Charitable Trusts' Global Penguin Conservation Campaign, are concerned that overexploitation of this remote food source — particularly in the face of rapidly changing environmental conditions — could take a devastating toll on the entire Southern Ocean ecosystem. So in many ways, these tiny crustaceans hauled out of the sea in one of the world's most remote places are becoming a key factor in thinking about what we choose to eat in a high CO 2 world.
Grappling for Balance
While still exceptionally abundant, according to the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, Antarctic krill populations have dropped an estimated 80 percent since the 1970s. Precisely why, scientists have not determined, but loss of sea ice is thought to be a major factor.
There is also new research indicating that Antarctic krill play an important role in how the Southern Ocean absorbs carbon. According to a report released earlier this year by the Antarctic and Southern Ocean Coalition, each year Antarctic krill absorb an amount of carbon equivalent to the weight of 15.2 million cars, or about 0.26 percent of annual anthropogenic CO 2 emissions. Krill are also crucial for moving nutrients from the ocean sediment to the surface, making them accessible to the entire suite of marine species.
All of these underscores the importance of maintaining abundant healthy krill populations. And it has scientists, international fisheries managers, seafood and fishing industry businesses, and conservationists grappling with how to balance a lucrative krill industry with protection of what's considered a key species for one of world's most climate-sensitive ecosystems.
Growing Fishery
The commercial Antarctic krill fishery dates back to the 1960s, Werner explains. At that time the main fleet was from the Soviet Union, and the krill catch went mainly to cattle feed. Thanks to government subsidies, the Soviet fleet's catch grew steadily until the early 1980s. It then dropped off with the elimination of subsidies and breakup of the Soviet Union.
The Antarctic krill fishery, now dominated by Norway, Korea and China, has been growing with increasing commercial interest in krill for omega-3 related products and for farmed seafood, pet, poultry and livestock feed. Most of the catch goes to animal and fish feed, with the rest to nutritional supplements and a very small portion processed for direct human consumption, mostly for Asian markets. Aquaculture is currently the fastest growing animal food industry, and Antarctic krill, with their high nutrient values, low concentration of pollutants and pinkish color (which can lend a desirable hue to seafood), are considered increasingly attractive as an aquaculture feed, particularly for raising farmed salmon.
Given that krill are found worldwide, why would countries as far away as Norway and China send ships to the furthest reaches of the Southern Hemisphere to catch these tiny crustaceans? Webjørn Eikrem, upstream operations executive vice president for Aker BioMarine, one of the world's largest krill products suppliers, says one reason is that the Southern Ocean populations are eminently catchable.
The aim is to keep the entire Antarctic marine ecosystem — the krill, the animals that eat them, and the interactions and processes that connect them — healthy while still providing economic and food security benefits.“Antarctic krill [are] very abundant and gregarious and come in huge numbers or large swarms, which makes it a very attractive target for commercial fisheries,” he says, while elsewhere in the world, krill “are scattered and mixed in with other fish,” posing greater by-catch problems. Aker BioMarine's director of global animal nutrition sales and former sustainability director Sigve Nordrum adds that, compared to other ocean waters, “the Southern Ocean is very free of any pollutants, so it's a clean product.”
Conserving the System
Active management of the Antarctic krill fishery began in 1982 when the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources formed in response to concern about growing commercial interest in Antarctic krill as well as exploitation of other Southern Ocean species — among them, fur seals and whales. An international treaty, CCAMLR is part of the broader Antarctic Treaty System. Its major goal has been to develop ecosystem-based, precautionary management for the krill fishery. As part of these efforts, CCAMLR sets enforceable catch limits and monitors fishing, fishing methods and krill populations. The aim is to keep the entire Antarctic marine ecosystem — the krill, the animals that eat them, and the interactions and processes that connect them — healthy and able to sustain fisheries that are both economically viable and can contribute to global food security.
But to catch Antarctic krill without harming other Southern Ocean species has taken considerable effort, explains Eikrem. When Aker BioMarine started its krill operations in 2003, it was clear that “the conventional trawling system was not going to work for krill, at least not for us,” he says. So the company began developing technologies that would allow its boats to catch krill without also trapping seals, birds, penguins or other marine mammals.
Aker BioMarine has also been working with World Wildlife Fund–Norway to develop other conservation measures. With WWF–Norway, Aker BioMarine has launched the Antarctic Wildlife Research Fund (also supported by Blackmores and Swisse, two Australian companies that sell krill oil products) to carry out long-term research on krill and their changing habitat. The fund's first fieldwork — studies of krill, their predators and their environment — is expected to get underway during the 2016 Antarctic summer that begins in November.
Additional Measures
Despite these ongoing efforts and the limits CCAMLR has imposed on krill catch, scientists and conservation groups — Pew Charitable Trusts, which manages the Antarctic Krill Conservation Project, and Oceana among them — are concerned, especially in the face of retreating sea ice and warming waters, that so much krill fishing occurs in the same places where penguins and seals hunt for krill. Commercial krill fishing also takes place during the summer open water season, which is when penguins and seals feed their young. Observations of Antarctic wildlife over the past 20 years suggest an increase in the times when parent penguins, albatrosses and seals have trouble getting enough krill to successfully feed and raise their babies.
The World Wildlife Fund and Marine Stewardship Council, which has certified Aker Biomarine's krill fishery, maintain that current Antarctic krill fishing is conservatively and sustainably managed. But in the face of climate change and increasing demand, many scientists and conservationists are recommending additional precautionary measures.
To better protect krill and other Antarctic wildlife and their habitat, Pew and other conservation groups have called for wildlife observers on all krill fishing vessels, dedicated funding for ongoing monitoring of Antarctic krill predators and more localized, focused management of krill fishing areas to better protect vulnerable habitat and species.
The conservation group Sea Shepherd, along with Pew and other environmental advocates have been calling for the CCAMLR Antarctic Treaty area to become a marine reserve. While concrete proposals have yet to be formulated, discussions of what such reserves might look like are now underway among Antarctic Treaty members, explains Andrea Kavanagh, director of Pew's Global Penguin Conservation Campaign.
“The very thing that makes the Antarctic krill situation so promising is what also makes it so risky.” – NOAA“We are seeing a localized depletion of krill in penguin feeding grounds due to targeted fishing pressures,” says Kavanagh. “Add to that the increasing threat of climate change impacting where several species of penguins can breed or forage, and the need for conservation measures becomes even more pressing.” Marine reserves and protected areas are the best way to protect these and other Antarctic species, she says.
The Antarctic marine ecosystem is still considered one of the world's most intact, but its resources are also being eyed for their potential to help feed a growing human population. Or as NOAA has described it, “[t]he very thing that makes the Antarctic krill situation so promising is what also makes it so risky. Because this vast resource is barely fished, it has the potential to help solve one of the great challenges of this century. But because it is barely fished, it supports one of the last great wild ecosystems on earth. When it comes to entering such places, we humans don't have a very good track record of keeping them intact.”
CCAMLR considers the krill catch numbers it currently allows to be “precautionary,” Werner says. These catch limits are designed to ensure there will always be enough krill to maintain healthy breeding. And the current annual Antarctic krill catch is estimated at only about 0.3 percent of the Southern Ocean's estimated population — roughly around 200,000 metric tons (220,000 tons).
But, says Werner, “at the end of the day, it is not only how much you fish but where. If krill is fished in a concentrated way, that could lead to so-called ‘local depletion' and that can have serious implications for land-based predators such as penguins.”
Whether the current trajectory of Antarctic krill conservation is sufficient to maintain populations needed to support the Southern Ocean ecosystem — especially in the face of rapidly accumulating climate change impacts — remains to be seen. What is clear, however, is how important the long-term health of this tiny creature is, not only to Antarctica's charismatic megafauna but to the entire region and to places — and people — well beyond.
State-mandated mediation between the City of Stockton and its creditors was set to expire at midnight on Monday, moving the Central Valley community one step closer to becoming the largest city in the country to go bankrupt. If the 90-day mediation fails, the City Council is set to vote Tuesday evening on a new budget to cover a $26 million deficit in case of bankruptcy. City officials would then have until July 1 to officially file for bankruptcy protection. Once a booming bedroom community for San Francisco Bay Area commuters, the city was hard hit by falling housing prices, enduring one of the highest foreclosure rates in the country. Since 2009, the city has cut some $90 million from its budget, including deep cutbacks to municipal staff, police and fire departments.
Los Angeles is a sprawling and diverse city, one of the cultural capitals of our world, but until very recently, its beer culture was nearly nonexistent. Thankfully, the craft beer tidal wave has finally broken on the shores of Los Angeles, and the long-suffering beer desert is now inundated with great beer pouring at bars, beer-centered restaurants and some world-class breweries.
In true L.A. fashion, finding the best the city has to offer means looking in some unexpected areas and going beyond the shallow surface. The rewards for exploration are worth the trouble, and if you can't find a personal guide to the best of the L.A.'s craft beer scene, then you can start with these recommendations. Leave your preconceived notions in the hotel — the beer in Los Angeles has gotten really good in recent years, and San Diego isn't the only destination-worthy beer region in Southern California anymore.
Breweries
It was only a few years ago when the number of breweries in Los Angeles could be counted on one hand. Thankfully, Angelenos thirsty for local suds now have their choice from dozens of production breweries and brewpubs, some specializing in hop-bombs and others in funky wild ales.
The South Bay Trifecta
The South Bay region of Southern California is an amalgamation of beach-side municipalities, blue-collar towns and ethnic enclaves that showcase the famous diversity of Los Angeles. The craft brewing industry has found a foothold in the industrial parks of cities like Torrance, Redondo Beach, and Carson. There's a lot of brewing action in the South Bay, but three breweries in particular demonstrate some of the best the Los Angeles has to offer: Smog City Brewery, Monkish Brewing and Phantom Carriage.
Smog City Brewery is the largest of the three and the most traditional. They brew a handful of excellent IPAs (Hop Tonic and Amarilla Gorilla, particularly), a perfectly crisp and floral bohemian pilsner, and one of the best coffee porters out there. The brewery is packed with dozens of wine and spirit barrels where bold stouts get the bourbon barrel aging treatment and wine barrels sour and funkify saisons and other belgian ales. Smog City is also known for their small-batch experimentations that often feature foraged fruits and herbs, one-off cask preparations, or explorations into wine/beer hybrids; they may be the region's most well-rounded brewery.
1. Smog City Brewing – 1901 Del Amo Boulevard #B, Torrance, CA 90501
Just a block away from Smog is Monkish Brewing, a distinctly different operation that turns a modern sensibility on some monastic brewing traditions. Owner and Brewmaster Henry Nguyen uses beer as a creative outlet and his Belgian-inspired brews range from hop-forward and drinkable pale ales to potent tripels infused with all manner of uncommon botanicals. Nguyen has tried everything from thyme (in the sadly retired Vigil dark wheat beer) to lotus seed (in Sunset Beer, a brett-spiked Belgian wit) to pistachio nuts (in the sublime Seme Della Vita, which also features vanilla beans). The secret to the beers is Nguyen's restraint with these adulterants. Nothing is overpowering in a Monkish beer — every spice and botanical is in balance with the estery yeast and complex malt profiles.
2. Monkish Brewing – 20311 Western Avenue, Torrance, CA 9050
In Carson, just a few miles away from the Smog City-Monkish one-two punch, is one of the South Bay's newest, and most exciting operations: Phantom Carriage. This “small batch beer endeavour” is part cafe, part brewery, and part barrel-filled blendery. The genre-defying brewery focuses on wood-aged sour ales and early offerings have shown tremendous promise. Named for a 1921 Swedish horror film, this nod to the dark and macabre carries through to the beer names (often paying homage to classic horror performers like Cushing and Rathbone) and the ambience. There's even an on-premises screening room (though L.A. Galaxy MLS games are shown about as often as the spooky stuff — the team is headquartered in Carson). Supplementing the house-beers is a guest tap list and a bottle-fridge filled with old-world favorites and American craft classics alike.
3. Phantom Carriage – 18525 S Main St, Carson, CA 90248
Hop-Head Hot-Spot
Hoppy brews dominate tap lists in Los Angeles, and nearly every brewery in town has a delicious hoppy offering to help slake Angelenos' never ending thirst for pungent brews. However, few L.A. breweries do hops as well as El Segundo Brewing Co. The trick is the brewery's focus on teasing disparate flavor profiles from different hop varieties. They have IPAs that focus on the tropical hops, earthy hop flavors, and classic West Coast pine and citrus profiles. Don't miss White Dog IPA — a wheat-based and tropical brew that's a perfect match for L.A.'s balmy climate, or the equally intense Mayberry IPA that showcases the subtleties of Mosaic hops.
4. El Segundo Brewing Co – 140 Main Street, El Segundo, CA 90245
Maybe the Best Brewpub in America
Beachwood Brewing and BBQ in Long Beach has earned a reputation among beer geeks as one of the highlights of brewing on the west coast, and the judges at the Great American Beer Festival have named them “Brewpub of the Year” two years running, as well as bestowing a half-dozen medals on individual beers. The food is smokey ‘que with a west coast flair, and the brews are bold, clean, and plentiful. You'll be tempted to order a glass from the list of AAA-tier guest taps, but the house brews never disappoint. Even styles that normally get no respect from beer-lovers are executed with panache and respect. Hops of Brixton is a delicately balanced ESB, Tart Simpson a bracing Berliner Weisse with a subtle hint of funk, and Foam Top will change your mind about the relevance of the American cream ale style in the modern craft beer milieu. They also make some of the best IPAs in Los Angeles (if not the State). You can't lose.
5. Beachwood BBQ – 210 East 3rd Street, Long Beach, CA
The Cutting Edge
When Highland Park Brewery opened in the rapidly gentrifying L.A. neighborhood of the same name, many beer-fans wrote off the operation as just another homebrewer trying to turn pro on a makeshift brewhouse. But veteran of the L.A. craft industry Bob Kunz has surprised everyone with the quality brews he's created in his tiny, 500-square foot brewery shoehorned into the back of a hip bar. From complex hoppy ales like Party IPA (which is also infused with Spanish cedar) to refreshing table beers featuring foraged botanicals (Yard Beer) to the funky stuff like Lazy Susan (a tart wheat ale made with 300 pounds of local peaches and nectarines) or Uncontrollable (an all-lactobacillus beer that was fermented in the warmth of the bar's parking lot to give the heat-loving bacteria some extra energy), Highland Park Brewery demonstrates a remarkable breadth of offerings for such a humble operation. It didn't take long for word of the great beers to get out of the neighborhood, and now HPB draws beer fans from across Los Angeles. The team hopes to open an ancillary tasting room by the end of 2015.
6. Highland Park Brewery / The Hermosillo – 5125 York Boulevard, Los Angeles, CA 90042
The “Real” Niche Brewery
Los Angeles has breweries that cover a lot of niches. There are big production breweries catering to the mass market and small IPA-focused operations and neighborhood spots with a loyal following, and in 2014 MacLeod Ale Brewing Co. opened in the Valley suburb of Van Nuys to bring UK-style “real ale” to the L.A. market. The small brewhouse is focused on turning out traditional British styles conditioned and served from casks in the traditional manner. It sounds like a risky move, but the brewery has found a fervent fan-base, and Brewmaster Andy Black has managed to make classic styles like ordinary bitters, small stouts, and drinkable Scottish ales exciting for the L.A.'s beer lovers. Nearly all of MacLeod's brews are under 5% alcohol (some are well under that), and they're served up in the taproom in generous 20-ounce Imperial pints at a balmy 54-degrees. Expect darts, dogs, and bagpipe music when you visit.

Bungie Studios
A new "Halo" project is in the works, with "Gladiator" director Ridley Scott signed up to serve as executive producer.
The 'digital feature' will see Sergio Mimica-Gezzan take the directorial reins, CNET's sister-site GameSpot reports, citing a Microsoft press release. Mimica-Gezzan has previously directed episodes of the geek-pleasing "Battlestar Galactica" TV show.
There's little information right now on what exactly a 'digital feature' is, but it seems unlikely to be a full bells-and-whistles Hollywood movie. Maybe it'll be an exclusive downloadable treat for Xbox One owners, or a series of shorts, à la 2010's "Halo Legends".
Meanwhile, "Halo 4: Forward Unto Dawn" was a live-action effort, while "Jaws" director Steven Spielberg is attached to a .
Games don't often translate into compelling movies, but here's hoping that the involvement of Ridley Scott's 'Scott Free' production house can spice things up a little. Scott is best known for his directing work, and is responsible for such classics as "Alien", "Thelma & Louise" and, er, "G.I. Jane".
Would you watch a Halo 'digital feature'? What advice would you offer its production team? Have your say in the comments below.

The first round of the Stanley Cup Playoffs features two powerhouse teams in beautiful California, the San Jose Sharks and Los Angeles Kings. Fans filled with bloodlust will salivate at the hard-hitting and tight-checking hockey that Western Conference playoff hockey represents. Stats nerds will blow loads on their spreadsheets trying to figure out who will come out on top. This series should be 7 games of frenetic hockey that can excite any fan (except us east-coasters who enjoy sleeping). I'm going to focus more on the numbers side, and how you can use them in pivotal moments. If you are intimidated by fancy stats, don't be. Come playoff time, they provide added clarity for a team's ability to defend a lead or stage a miracle comeback. It can help explain all of the magic and drama come playoff time.
Both of these teams are the darlings of advanced-stats followers, and for good reason. Despite having amazing regular season records, they leave much more to be desired in the goals column, which can be a scary thing to think about if you are another team in the West. Luckily for some (*cough Anaheim* *cough Colorado*), one of these teams will be eliminated far earlier than they should. Each team has major strengths and weaknesses that can be interpreted through the underlying stats.
Stats in 5v5 situations become even more enhanced come playoff time, where refs are more notorious for keeping their hands firmly entrenched in their pockets rather than holding whistles. While some exceptions can occur in a game-to-game basis, we can have a general idea of how important these stats are. In 5v5 “close” situations (where the game is within one goal after two periods or tied in the third), we can get a feel for how well a team plays when under pressure. A high Corsi Close or Fenwick Close indicates a team is controlling the play through possession and shots, a very good attribute in the intense moments of a tight playoff game. In a playoff situation, I prefer the use of Fenwick over Corsi due to the fact that it ignores blocked shots. Players are willing to do whatever it takes in a playoff game, throwing their faces in front of shots at will. FF% allows for the glorification of this determination, while also rewarding teams that can get shots through the piles of humanity in front of them. After 81 games, the LA Kings lead the league in Fenwick For percentage (FF%) at 56.7%, which is bordering on a ridiculously high number, whereas the Sharks sit 3rd in the league at 54.6%. Since both of these values are impressive while isolated, we can also use other metrics to determine who truly has the edge.
Despite being 8th in the league in shots for, the Kings have a ludicrously low shooting percentage at only 6.1%. When you consider the talent on that team, an uptick in shooting percentage seems almost automatic. The Sharks have a more respectable shooting percentage at 7.5% (18th in the league), but they are also due for a slight increase due to being third in the league in shots for! When you consider these don't include missed/blocked shots, these stats become even more intimidating. I truly feel for any fans of the losing team in this matchup.
With these incredible shot metrics for both teams, the old cliché arises that the goalie must be the team's best player come playoff time. While both goalies have won a Stanley Cup previously, this is where the matchup begins to clear up. The Kings are second in the league with a 93.6 Sv% in 5v5 close situations, which almost completely absolves the team of what little lost possession they have. The Sharks, meanwhile, have a 92.1 Sv%, which leaves enough volatility to cause concern when playing a powerhouse shooting team with an abnormally low shooting percentage. Based on the underlying stats of the most common type of play variant, the Kings seems to have a moderate edge over the Sharks.
While 5v5close is the most accurate measure of a team's skill in a common play variant, playoff atmosphere can cause tensions to run high. If discipline is rampantly abandoned in an attempt to intimidate, the Sharks become a much scarier team. While 5v4, the Sharks generate the most shots in the league at 483, yet sit 25th in 5v4 Sh% (9.7%). When you combine that with an 88.8 FF% (not to mention the personnel they possess), the Sharks are due to breakout in a big way on the powerplay. While the Kings have a similar shooting percentage (9.4%), they don't generate nearly as many shots (406). Darryl Sutter would be wise to avoid tempting fate, and I feel that undisciplined play will result in a long stay on the bench.
Considering the underlying statistics, this series may come down to how each coach manages their bench.
As these graphs show, the Kings have a decided advantage in favourable zone starts (due to their obscene CF/FF), and possession seems spread out evenly over 4 lines. While the Shark's graph may not look as pretty (remember: the darker the blue, the better), but their best players hit the sweet spot of player usage charts. Unfavourable zone starts combined with high quality of competition should result in lost possession, but most of the Sharks top-6 maintains possession despite the disadvantages of their play. Todd McLellan trusts his top guns to carry the load in the defensive end, allowing his less-skilled forwards to gain more favourable matchups.
All of these metrics are important to consider, but can they actually determine who will win this series? Advanced stats can give us an insight as to what strategy each team should be striving towards in-game. We can determine that the Kings are more likely to dictate 5v5 possession, but that the Sharks are not as affected as other teams due to previous player usage habits. What this series may come down to is the bottom six play of both teams. An unsung plugger getting hot at the right time for either team could be enough to turn the entire tide of the series. Makes for great drama, doesn't it?

Metro Vancouver Transit Police are hoping to contact the victim of a dangerous assault on a SkyTrain platform.
Just before 9 a.m. on Monday, a young woman was standing on the westbound platform at Broadway and Commercial SkyTrain Station when a man grabbed her by the shoulder and pushed her towards the tracks. The woman teetered before regaining her balance, just as the train was pulling in. She then boarded the train and was not seen again.
A witness reported the incident to a SkyTrain Attendant who advised Transit Police. Officers then took the 25 year old suspect into custody a short distance from Stadium-Chinatown Station.
The victim of this incident is described as “possibly an Asian female, mid 20s, 5'3” to 5'5” tall, slim build, long dark hair in a ponytail with a white headband, wearing a grey jacket, burgundy shirt, black tights and dark sunglasses.”
Due to the approaching train and the dangers associated to the electric current on the tracks, this young woman's life was put in danger and Transit Police would like to speak to her and anyone else who may have witnessed this assault. They are asked to call 604-515-8300 or text 87-77-77 with any information.

Climate science at the CSIRO is bouncing back one year after executives modelled its demise, securing new revenue streams in the Pacific and China, and looking to hire new staff.
On February 4 last year, chief executive Larry Marshall shocked staff in the country's premier research body by stating that because the question of whether the climate was changing "has been answered", it was time to deploy resources elsewhere.
At the time as many as 110 of the 140 staff in the Oceans & Atmosphere unit were considered for the axe as part of broader cuts of 350.
Amid a realisation that other agencies – from NASA to the Australian Antarctic Division – depended on CSIRO colleagues and couldn't be easily cut, and a public uproar at home and abroad, the number of redundancies was whittled back.
The United States government has ruled that it's perfectly legal for you to jailbreak your phone — and by jailbreak, we mean that it's not going to violate any copyright laws. But don't think that you're going to be able to legally hack any of your other devices, because the US Copyright Office says that tablets are excluded from this ruling.
As reported by The Verge, the US Copyright Office issued rulings on exemptions to the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) today and said that the “category of tablets is difficult to define” so rather than issue a blanket exemption, it declined to lump tablet devices in with phones.
The DMCA was created by the US government in an attempt to implement and adhere to the WIPO Copyright Treaty and WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty that were both passed in 1996. The Act was designed to establish rules in the digital marketplace to govern copyright owners, consumers, manufacturers, distributors, libraries, educators, and online service providers.
What the US Copyright Office was judging specifically was software interoperability. The issue before the Office was how to address:
Computer programs that enable wireless telephone handsets to execute lawfully obtained software applications, where circumvention is accomplished for the sole purpose of enabling interoperability of such applications with computer programs on the telephone handset.
The item on the docket seems to address iPhone and smartphone usage because when you're dealing with applications, the one issue that many faces is that you can find it on one platform, but not always on the other.
The Electronic Frontier Foundation, along with the New America Foundation's Open Technology Initiative, New Media Rights, Mozilla Corporation, and the Free Software Foundation petitioned the US Copyright Office to grant an exemption to the DMCA and it was ruled that since many smartphones have access control protections, the request to have “lawfully acquired applications interoperable with the handset's software” was deemed fair and that access controls “adversely affected that function.”
But when the issue surrounding tablets came up, the US Copyright Office determined that there was insufficient basis to grant an exemption, but it did leave the door open for future exemptions. Opponents of granting an exemption claimed that the DMCA already defined “the contours of acceptable circumvention related to interoperability” and in the end, managed to sway the ruling in their favor, but there was one important note to the ruling. The US Copyright Office found that:
…proponents had established that the prohibition is adversely affecting and likely to continue to have an adverse impact on, certain use of mobile devices in which the firmware, a copyrightable work, is protected by technological measures. The evidence in the record indicated that smartphones have been widely adopted and that consumer acceptance of such devices will continue to increase in the future…
So the exemption appears to be granted to smartphones because they had been widely adopted, more so than tablets. As more applications become available for these devices and as it proliferates through our daily lives, you could probably expect the government to review its exemption ruling again and allow interoperability to become legal.
This ruling came at the US Copyright Office's triennial meeting.

He watched from afar during the absence, keeping tabs on the old home in the desert. Radim Vrbata had never really wanted to leave the Arizona Coyotes in July 2014 anyway, so for two years in Vancouver he tracked their record, followed their front-office changes, and stayed in regular touch—“coaches, people around the team, players, everybody”—deep down hoping to return sometime soon. “I learned, if you have been in one place,” Vrbata says, “you should stay there no matter what.”
Through Wednesday night, exactly three weeks into the '16-17 season, 719 players had appeared in NHL games. Among them, according to research by SI.com, 14 are with clubs that previously employed them earlier in their careers. Only one, however, is enjoying the ultra-rare re-reunion, a third separate stint with the same team. “Must have a soft spot for him or something,” Coyotes coach Dave Tippett says. “Some players just have a place where they feel comfortable.”
Why such a blissful marriage between Arizona and its 35-year-old Czech winger? Familiarity, mostly. After signing a one-year, bonus-laden deal in mid-August, Vrbata and his family found another home in the same neighborhood where they previously spent six seasons. There's Tippett, who was hired behind the Coyotes' bench in Sept. 2009, two months after Vrbata's first return, and oversaw Vrbata's 35-goal outburst in '11-12. There's center Martin Hanzal, Vrbata's linemate, countryman, close friend, and one-time road roommate, whose children now play mini-sticks together in the family room during games. And, obviously, the weather. “We love the sun,” Vrbata says. “Little tough early on when it would be dark or rainy in Vancouver.”
Yes, Vrbata enjoyed morsels of his tenure with the Canucks. He praises the organization, shouting out team trainers and PR staffers, and calls Vancouver “one of the most beautiful cities in the world.” His oldest son, Krystof, began skating there after showing little interest in Arizona. He made the NHL All-Star Game for the first time, finished the '14-15 season with a career-high 63 points, and was voted team MVP by fans. It all easily justified the two-year, $5 million contract that Vrbata had signed, “a deal you have to take,” he says today.
Then everything veered off course. In '15-16, Vrbata's offensive production almost halved, from 0.80 to 0.43 points per game, and his ice time (16:03) dropped to its lowest in seven years. His linemates, once the Sedin twins, became a host of bottom-six youngsters. The Canucks missed the playoffs, and soon Vrbata was looking elsewhere in free agency. “One season was unbelievably good,” he says. “The other was unbelievably bad. The first season was as good as I could've hoped for. Last year it just didn't work for anybody.”
An even worse situation brought Vrbata back to the Coyotes the first time. Then six seasons into his career, having already made stops in Colorado, Carolina, and Chicago, Vrbata had chased a lucrative payday in Tampa Bay—three years, $9 million total—only to leave after 18 games, sacrificing salary and returning to the Czech Republic. Eventually, his agent, Rich Evans, received permission from the Lightning to arrange a trade. Guess which willing partner he found.
“I became a free agent for the first time in my career and maybe just went for the money,” Vrbata says of his Tampa Bay deal. “Maybe should've just stayed here the first time around.”
No matter, for thrice will suffice. With three wins and six standings points in nine games, the Coyotes currently reside in the league cellar, but Vrbata has hardly slowed down. All four of his goals have come at even strength. His current line, centered by Hanzal and opposite young speedster Max Domi, has a solid 53.45% shot attempt rate at 5-on-5, and he's back above 17:00 in average ice time. “We thought he was a good pickup for us to supplement some scoring, allow some of our younger players to continue to grow,” Tippett says. “We knew exactly what he is, and what he was coming in, and that's what he's given us so far.”
Hanzal first learned what the elder Czech was all about during his rookie season in '07-08, Vrbata's first in Arizona. “When I had a bad game, he always let me know,” Hanzal says. “He was really hard on me, but he was trying to help me out. Even when he was yelling at me, I know he always meant well.” Presumably this also applies to those middle-of-the-night moments on the road, when Hanzal would awaken to a pillow whacking his face, because his snores were bothering Vrbata. “Guess he didn't like that,” Hanzal says, laughing.
Fifty-seven NHL games away from reaching 1,000, Vrbata claims he hasn't considered what lies beyond his current deal, and whether that future includes the Coyotes. But given its short term and his love for Arizona, it would seem that he's simply auditioning for more time under Tippett, beside Hanzal and everyone else. “I don't look at it this way,” he says. “You see what's happening in the league where everybody's trying to get younger. This leaves everything open for the team and for myself, see how the season goes and we will see what happens in the summer.”
At least one thing is already known. “When he's comfortable, and feeling settled, that's when he seems to perform the best,” Evans says. “That seems to have borne itself out.”
What was once the norm is now so rare that October 2014's results are bizarrely backwards.
The 911 was Porsche's best-selling model in the United States in October 2014. Stop the presses. Hold the cheese. Alert the medic. Release the proverbial hounds.
The 911 is by all accounts a sports car, even if it's softer and plusher and more hushed and more PDK'd than ever before. Indeed, the 911 is not an SUV, the type of vehicle which normally dominates Porsche's sales charts.
Nevertheless, we can't expect to see the 911 riding high atop the Porsche leaderboard for long. October's results for the Cayenne came, Porsche says, “ahead of the introduction of the comprehensively revised 2015 model which goes on sale in November.” Inventory was low; customers want the newer model; the Macan stands in the way for some consumers.
But Porsche fans and crossover haters and rear-engine aficionados can still point to October 2014 as a month in which American consumers registered more new 911s than any other Porsche. With 974 sales, it was the 911's third month above 900 units this year and the second-best month of 2014. October marked the end of a four-month growth period in which 911 volume shot up 22%.
On an annual basis, surpassing 2013's 911 sales performance won't be easy. The 911 is on pace to do so, rising 6% through ten months. But 911 volume took off in November of last year, surging to the model's best month ever with 1368 sales. At the current rate, Porsche should sell around 10,500 911s this year, a slight increase compared with last year.
Back to October more specifically, an increase in Boxster volume, nothing more than a slight decrease from the Cayman, and five more 918 Spyder sales meant Porsche's sports cars accounted for 45.8% of brand-wide sales.
The Cayenne, suddenly (and temporarily) down 57% to 712 units, and the Macan, at 741 sales, generated 39.6% of Porsche USA volume. The Panamera was up 6% to 533 units, 14.5% of Porsche's 3667-unit total.
The sports car group was up from 39.1% one year ago; the SUVs were down from 46.9%.
As for rivals, the 911's direct opponents are difficult to define, so broad is its range. Chevrolet sold 2959 Corvettes in October, yes, but the all-American is a much more affordable car. BMW's 6-Series range, sedan included, was down 20% to 740. Mercedes-Benz SL sales fell 33% to 347. Jaguar sold 342 F-Types, a 3% drop. BMw sold 204 i8s. Nissan sold 140 GT-Rs, a 26% jump. Dodge Viper volume was up 16% to 80. Audi R8 sales slid 38% to 40 units.
This sterling performance from the brand's most iconic nameplate and its two-seat cohorts is not in keeping with conventional outcomes, of course. Not since February 2012, when Porsche said the Cayenne's 30% drop to just 657 units related to, “limited supply and low dealer inventory,” has the 911 or any non-SUV Porsche been the brand's top seller.

Hacking Sony apparently didn't stop George Hotz from landing a job at Facebook.
Techunwrapped revealed that Hotz, the hacker known as Geohot who pioneered jailbreaking the iPhone and became embroiled in a lawsuit with Sony after publishing the PlayStation 3's root keys, has taken a position at Facebook.
Joshua Hill (P0sixninja), a member of the Chronic-Dev Team -- the group responsible for greenpois0n, the premiere iOS jailbreak software -- said in a video that Hotz declined an iOS jailbreak challenge (finding a boot ROM exploits in the iPad 2) to keep out of the media spotlight and also to focus on his new job at Facebook.
Then Gabe Rivera of Techmeme confirmed Techunwrapped's report in a tweet by sending readers to Hotz's Facebook page, where, on June 22, Hotz wrote: "Facebook is really an amazing place to work...first hackathon over." Speculation has it that Hotz is working on the long-awaited Facebook app for the iPad.
Facebook's hiring of Geohot signifies a shift in corporate temperament when it comes to hackers. The days of lawsuits and retaliation may be ending as more tech giants partner with rather than punish the anonymous hunters on the Web.
Consider the actions of Microsoft. After a multitude of awesome projects stemmed from people tinkering with the Kinect, Microsoft opened its arms to hackers and then released the Xbox peripheral's SDK beta kit to the public.
Hotz's new employer won't make every hacker's problems go away, but it does mean that talent hunters and the companies they represent are wising up to how the Internet now works.
This story, "Sony Hacker Said to Land Facebook Job" was originally published by PCWorld .
The Mavericks signed Harrison Barnes to a four-year, $94 million maximum contract this summer, hoping he could grow into a franchise cornerstone. The decision was questioned at the time because despite his championship pedigree, Barnes had failed to have a major effect at the individual level in his four-year career and was awful in last year's finals.
If his preseason play is any indication, the transition from role player to star will be harder than even the skeptics had imagined.
In seven preseason games, Barnes averaged seven points and three rebounds in 20 minutes per game while shooting 27 percent from the floor. He's missed 18 of his 21 three-pointers and has as many assists as turnovers. The concerns about his ability to take on more responsibility on a new team have been validated, at least so far.
It's preseason, which barely qualifies as NBA basketball. Teams are giving tryouts to players who are hoping to make the team and the rotations are not set. Most projected starters get a pass, and Mavericks coach Rick Carlisle doesn't seem too worried.
"Shooting percentages have never been an important thing to me," Carlisle said, via ESPN's Tim MacMahon. "I look much more at the process, the force, and conviction with which guys are stepping into shots. He's ready to go. He'll be ready on Wednesday."
But everyone is watching Barnes after his maximum contract. Unfortunately for the Mavericks, he's been incapable of creating for himself or others throughout his NBA career.
The Warriors tried to make Barnes the captain of their bench in the 2013-14 season, and it went poorly. The same problems he had then remained. His handle is not tight or varied enough to allow him to drive in traffic. He almost always goes to his right, and since he can't get to the rim, he settles for mid-range jumpers or launches little runners and floaters that he lacks the touch to convert.
When Golden State needed a bucket from Barnes, they fed him the ball in the mid-post. He usually had mismatches, as Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson typically occupied the opponent's best defenders. He could even overpower or shoot over some wings.
Now that he's a featured option, though, he needs to score in different ways. His face-up game is serviceable but he's not a knockdown mid-range shooter and he lacks the explosive first step to get past defenders.
There are no new tricks in his game.
Worst yet, his lack of court vision is also obvious in those plays. He gets his blinders on when he has the ball and the offense grinds to a halt. He's using more possessions than in the past, but he's averaging less than two assists per 36 minutes so far, a lower mark than the already poor one he posted in Golden State last season.
It's too early to panic about Barnes, to be sure. He's just 24 years old and being asked to consistently do things he hasn't done before. Some of the looks off drives and post-ups that are rimming out now will go in later. The same applies for some of the three-pointers he's missing. He's a 37-percent career outside shooter who has missed at a high rate in preseason.
He also contributes in other areas outside of offense. Barnes is a decent rebounder and defender. His length and athleticism allow him to move up a spot to play power forward and to handle smaller players in a pinch. That versatility helped the Warriors reach the finals twice in the past two seasons, and should give Carlisle a lot of lineup options.
But is that enough to warrant a max contract? Second-year wing Justin Anderson provides similar spot up shooting and work on the boards at a fraction of the price.
What Dallas needed was a rising star to pick up the mantle and let Dirk Nowitzki fade into a secondary role. Nothing Barnes did in Golden State suggested he was that player. His play in preseason certainly won't change that perception.
With time, Barnes might develop into the featured offensive weapon the Mavericks thought he could be. But for now, it looks like they've added nothing more than an expensive role player.
KANSAS CITY, Mo. -- A Kansas church group that protests at military funerals nationwide filed suit in federal court, saying a Missouri law banning such picketing infringes on religious freedom and free speech.
The American Civil Liberties Union filed the lawsuit Friday in the U.S. District Court in Jefferson City, Mo., on behalf of the fundamentalist Westboro Baptist Church, which has outraged mourning communities by picketing service members' funerals with signs condemning homosexuality.
The church and the Rev. Fred Phelps say God is allowing troops, coal miners and others to be killed because the United States tolerates gay men and lesbians.
Missouri lawmakers were spurred to action after members of the church protested in St. Joseph, Mo., last August at the funeral of Army Spec. Edward L. Myers.
The law bans picketing and protests "in front of or about" any location where a funeral is held, from an hour before it begins until an hour after it ends. Offenders can face fines and jail time.
A number of other state laws and a federal law, signed in May by President Bush, bar such protests within a certain distance of a cemetery or funeral.
In the lawsuit, the ACLU says the Missouri law tries to limit protesters' free speech based on the content of their message. It is asking the court to declare the ban unconstitutional and to issue an injunction to keep it from being enforced, which would allow the group to resume picketing.
"I told the nation, as each state went after these laws, that if the day came that they got in our way, that we would sue them," said Phelps's daughter Shirley L. Phelps-Roper, a spokeswoman for the church in Topeka, Kan. "At this hour, the wrath of God is pouring out on this country."
Scott Holste, a spokesman for Missouri Attorney General Jay Nixon, said, "We're not going to acquiesce to anything that they're asking for in this lawsuit."
The suit names Nixon, Gov. Matt Blunt (R) and others as defendants.
ERBIL — Following the Kurdish delegation's visit to Baghdad, Iraqi PM Haidar al-Abadi said on Tuesday in a press conference that they have reached an agreement with Kurdistan Region over the Mosul offensive as well as the financial issues.
Abadi said that they held talks with the Kurdish delegation headed by Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) PM on the operation of Mosul and the financial issues between Baghdad and Erbil. The Iraqi PM claimed that both sides have reached an agreement over those issues.
The Iraq's PM reiterated that there is a close coordination among Baghdad, Erbil and the anti-Islamic State (IS) global coalition, adding that there are no foreign troops in Iraq except the military teams for training the local forces in the country.
KRG PM Nechirvan Barzani and his accompanying delegation on Monday met with Iraqi PM in Baghdad to discuss some issues pertaining to the war against IS, particularly the anticipated Mosul offensive, oil exports, and their bilateral ties.
Barzani also met with Iraqi President Fuad Masoum and the Speaker of Iraqi Parliament Salim al-Jabouri. He also met with a number of senior Sunni politicians in Baghdad and they all highlighted the importance of Sunnis' participation in the operation to liberate Mosul from IS group.
During his visit to Baghdad, the Kurdistan Region delegation also met the US envoy to Iraq, and leaders of Iraq's main political parties.
A new report claims that at least 60 Islamists who fought for the Islamic State in Syria and Iraq have been allowed to return to Canada despite some of them not even having Canadian citizenship.
Around 180 individuals, referred to as “extremist travellers” by the Canadian government, who have connections to Canada have travelled to various countries to fight for Islamic State and other radical Islamic terrorist groups. The Canadian government officials call the returning jihadists “extremist travellers” and are now worried that many of them may be a serious security risk to the safety of Canadians, broadcaster Global News reports.
According to the U.S. Soufan Centre, who recently released a report on returning Islamic state radicals, despite the losses for the terror group in the Middle East, the ideology of radical Islamism, “will remain real for many years to come”.
“It is highly likely that even as the territorial caliphate shrinks and is increasingly denied an overt presence, its leadership will look to supporters overseas, including returnees, to keep the brand alive,” the report states.
“If on return they begin again to feel as rootless and lacking in purpose as they did before they left, then they are unlikely to settle back easily into a ‘normal' life,” the authors wrote and noted that the returning fighters would be, “particularly vulnerable to contact from people who were part of the network that recruited them, or appeals for help from ex-comrades in arms”.
Canada has already endured terrorist attacks for which the Islamic State has taken credit. The most notable was the killing of Corporal Nathan Cirillo who was gunned down while guarding the National War Memorial in Ottawa in 2014.
Terror in Canada: Bloody Police Chase After Man With Islamic State Flag Rams Police Barricade, Stabs Officer https://t.co/HnwT7FdsXI — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) October 1, 2017
Earlier this month, a man in Edmonton, Alberta, rammed his car into a police barricade then emerged from his vehicle and stabbed an Edmonton Police Service special duty member multiple times. Police later found the flag of the Islamic State in his vehicle.
One Islamic State returnee spoke to Canadian media about his experiences as part of the terror group's “Sharia Police”. The unnamed Pakistani-Canadian brushed off his time with the terror group saying: “We all do things that we regret … All that's behind me.”
Former Conservative Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper and his government had passed a motion to strip terrorists of their Canadian citizenship. The motion was later overturned by current Prime Minister Justin Trudeau which also restored the citizenship of an Islamist who plotted to bomb Toronto.
The 'miracle' animal, as rare as one in 10 million, is heralded as a sacred event by north-east tribes who gathered in celebration
Hundreds of Native Americans wearing the traditional garb of their ancestors, sang songs and beat drums on a western Connecticut farm Saturday in celebration of the birth of one of the world's rarest animals - a white bison.
The miracle calf was officially named Yellow Medicine Dancing Boy at the elaborate ceremony at the Mohawk Bison farm in Goshen, in the state's northwestern hills. It was born 16 June at the farm of fourth-generation farmer Peter Fay.
Many Native Americans consider white bison a symbol of hope and unity; some consider their births sacred events. Experts say white bison are as rare as one in 10 million.
Yellow Medicine Dancing Boy is not an albino, and Fay said DNA testing confirmed the animal's bloodlines are pure and there was no intermingling with cattle.
Lakota tribe members from South Dakota were among the hundreds of people who gathered at the celebration. Other tribal elders from the Mohawk, Seneca and Cayuga tribes participated.
Crowds patiently waited by the roadside before slowly marching into the pasture and lining up alongside a fence as the ceremony began. Children squeezed up against their parents and peered through the fence.
Some women were dressed in colorful tunics and other items indigenous to Native American culture, including bracelets, feathers and boots. Men also wore traditional costumes. Those leading the ceremony wore plain and small headdresses.
Fay, 53, runs the farm below Mohawk Mountain and invited Native Americans to the event, which also included a feast and talks by tribe elders.
"I'm almost like the calf to them because I'm the caregiver. They've been here almost every day, teaching me," said Fay, who has a herd of bison tattooed on his right shoulder.
Fay attended a sweat lodge ceremony with the elders on Friday night in Cornwall. The nearly two-hour ceremony was a way to repair damage done to their spirits, minds and bodies. It acted as a prayer for a name for the calf to come to them through the spirits.
Saturday's ceremony was held under an arbor next to a large fire, amid thunder and large dark rain clouds. Marian and Chubb White Mouse, members of the Oglala Lakota tribe in South Dakota, traveled to Goshen from Wanblee, South Dakota, to lead the ceremony.
Marian White Mouse told the crowd the birth of a white bison is a sign from a prophet, the White Buffalo Calf Woman, who helped them endure times of strife and famine.
"We come with one prayer, one heart and one mind," she said tearfully. "This is truly a miracle. I hope that this one prayer will keep my people together, keep all of us together."
Barbara Threecrow, an elder from the Naticoke tribe who lives in Hudson Valley, New York, sat holding a sacred Canupa of beaver skin containing a pipe.
"I believe this is an awakening," Threecrow said. "This is a way of telling people to remember the sacredness of all life."
The United States as seen by its residents
In Athens County, Ohio, a family sits in the bus where they live. They're the subjects of a multimedia story by Meg Roussos, a student at Ohio University. Upon discovering her work, courtesy of photographer Jonathan Adams, I was thrilled: it's exactly the sort of photography that What America Looks Like seeks to highlight. Today, we'll look at several more of her photos, and some of her reporting on this family.
And throughout this week, I'll highlight other exceptional work from the project Soul of Athens, where numerous visual communication students are trying to examine "the changing American dream." Now let's return to that bus in the woods, as captured by Meg Roussos, who created all the words and images that follow:
The school bus is small for five people. Shelves are stacked to the ceiling, filled with clothes and food. Headlamps hang from a bungee cord. There are touches of home, like a bookcase Smiles built. They improvise solutions to simple problems that do not exist in traditional houses.The kids warm bricks on the wood-burning stove and place them at their feet to keep warm during winter. Eli pulls out a roll-away bed every night, and Forest sleeps on the couch. There is no running water. They compost their waste. They have to start a generator in order to charge their cell phones.
Simon steps through the kitchen, as Space's homemade apple pies wait to be baked in the oven. "It is such a blessing to have this oven in here, I am able to bake a lot of homemade things," she says.
Eli reads comic books to Smiles sitting nearby as his brothers look over his shoulder at the pictures. The boys place their feet on a warmed brick from the stove.
POLITICO Pro President will sign Russia sanctions bill
President Barack Obama will sign a bipartisan bill that ratchets up sanctions on Russia by targeting the country's energy, defense and financial sectors, White House press secretary Josh Earnest said in a press briefing today.
The legislation authorizes the president to provide $350 million over the next three years in military assistance to Ukraine, including defense equipment, services and training aimed at helping the country re-establish its sovereignty and territorial integrity.
Story Continued Below
Pressure had been building around the White House this week to sign the Ukraine Freedom Support Act of 2014.
The bill was introduced by Sen. Robert Menendez (D-N.J.), chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.), the panel's ranking member, during Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko's visit to the United States in September.
The Senate approved the bill by a voice vote on Thursday, but had to vote again for technical reasons after the House approved the legislation. Final approval came late Saturday.
“On behalf of the people's House, I urge President Obama to sign this bipartisan legislation,” House Speaker John Boehner said in a statement issued Monday, noting the measure was unanimously approved by both chambers.
Like many members of Congress, the administration remains deeply concerned about the aggressive actions of Russia in Ukraine, including the occupation and attempted annexation of Crimea and support to separatists in eastern Ukraine, a senior administration official said.
“It is also important that our sanctions regime strikes a delicate balance that maintains a united front with allies and partners, optimizes costs on Russia, and minimizes the impact on American business, international oil markets and the global economy. We will be evaluating whether the amended legislation enables us to sustain this important approach,” the official said.
“This legislation sends a very direct message to President [Vladimir] Putin, who must change his calculus in Ukraine and abandon this disruptive path,” Menendez said in a statement. “The territorial integrity of Ukraine must be restored and President Putin must understand that his destabilizing actions have serious and profound consequences for his country.”
“The hesitant U.S. response to Russia's continued invasion of Ukraine threatens to escalate this conflict even further,” Corker added. “Unanimous support for our bill demonstrates a firm commitment to Ukrainian sovereignty and to making sure Putin pays for his assault on freedom and security in Europe.”
Reps. Jim Gerlach (R-Pa.) and Marcy Kaptur (D-Ohio), and other members of the bipartisan Congressional Ukrainian Caucus were a driving force behind the bill in the House.
U.S. companies earlier expressed concern about the legislation but welcomed changes that preserve White House flexibility in imposing the new measures.
“We regret that Congress has legislated additional U.S. sanctions against Russia, which will impede the administration's ability to calibrate sanctions as part of the U.S.-EU effort to change Russia's conduct in Ukraine,” Richard Sawaya, vice president of the USA*Engage, a business group opposed to unilateral U.S. sanctions, said in a statement. “Adding more sanctions perforce will put U.S. businesses with operations and strategic investments in Russia across multiple sectors at further risk, whatever the outcome in Ukraine.”
The legislation requires Obama to apply sanctions against Russian defense firms, including specifically Rosoboronexport, that are contributing to instability in Ukraine, Moldova, Georgia and Syria.
It also authorizes the president to prohibit U.S. persons from investing in or purchasing significant amounts of Gazprom equity or debt, and to impose one additional sanction on Gazprom, the country's large natural gas company, if he determines that that the company is withholding significant amounts of natural gas from NATO members or countries such as Ukraine, Moldova or Georgia.
Another provision authorizes restrictions on foreign financial institutions' dealings with the United States banking system if they have engaged in significant sanctionable transactions related to Russia's defense and energy sectors or substantial transactions on behalf of any Russian individual or entity sanctioned in connection with the crisis in Ukraine.
Approved military defense items for Ukraine include anti-tank and anti-armor weapons; crew weapons and ammunition; radars that identify and target artillery batteries; fire control, range finder and optical and guidance and control equipment; tactical troop-operated surveillance drones; and secure command and communications equipment.
The bill requires the administration to develop a plan for how the United States, other governments and international organizations will help Ukraine protect and assist those displaced by the fighting.
It also directs the administration to work with Ukraine to develop a short-term emergency energy assistance plan that will help the country address a potential fuel and electricity shortage in 2014-15 as well as a longer-term plan to improve Ukraine's energy security.
In another area, the bill calls on the president to submit a strategy to Congress that outlines U.S. efforts to strengthen Ukrainian civil society, support independent media, reduce corruption and increase election-monitoring capacity, in addition to authorizing $20 million in fiscal 2016 to support those activities.
The legislation encourages the president to assist entities in the Ukrainian defense sector to reorient exports away from customers in Russia and to find appropriate alternative markets for their products.
The bill authorizes $10 million from fiscal 2016 through 2018 to counter Russian propaganda in the former Soviet Union countries, and it prioritizes Russian-language broadcasting into Ukraine, Moldova and Georgia. It also authorizes $20 million over the same period for pro-democracy and anti-corruption efforts in Russia.
The College of Cardinals will convene Tuesday to begin the formal process of selecting a new pope to lead the world's 1.2 billion Catholics, the Vatican announced Friday.
In their eighth general congregation, or pre-conclave meeting, the cardinals voted to start the conclave Tuesday afternoon, after a morning “pro eligendo Romano Pontifice” Mass in St. Peter's Basilica.
The cardinals will convene inside the Sistine Chapel, and they are sworn to secrecy and barred from contact with the outside world until their deliberations are complete. Voting begins the first afternoon. If no papal candidate receives the required two-thirds of the votes, the ballot is repeated twice each morning and afternoon. If, after the third day, no pope is elected, a one-day break for prayer is permitted. Since the early 20th century, no conclave has lasted more than five days.
In his daily update Friday with the Catholic Channel on Sirius XM, Cardinal Timothy Dolan of New York said he thought the cardinals by Saturday could complete their pre-conclave sessions — in which they listen to discussions of the challenges facing the church in individual countries and take the measure of the men among them who could be pope.
“That's certainly not my decision. That's to the congregation,” Dolan said. “But I'm sensing, perhaps, I'm sensing a hope that we may be able to wrap up the meetings by tomorrow.”
From the moment Benedict XVI announced his retirement, speculation started to swirl over who will replace him as Pope. Ben Connors gives us a look at a few of the prospects. (The Fold/The Washington Post)
The picking of the date puts to rest one of the first questions of the selection process and turns attention to more interesting mysteries: Will the Italians, who dominated the papacy for more than four centuries before the ascent of Poland's John Paul II in 1978, reclaim the throne, or will another non-Italian pope be selected? (Benedict XVI is German.)
Will the 266th pontiff be the first from the so-called New World, either from South America, where the church's 200 million faithful are courted in a lively religious marketplace, or from North America, where American and Canadian candidates are seen as surprisingly strong? Or will the church look to Africa, where it is gaining strength, or Asia?
And finally, who will emerge victorious from the power struggles inside the college: Prelates aligned with the church bureaucracy? Or the outsiders who hope to reform it?
On Sunday, many of the cardinals are expected to visit their titular churches in Rome, offering what could be a last glimpse of the prelates before they enter the conclave (from the Latin “with a key”). Before they begin a Vatican lockdown, they will spend these last days hammering out alliances, gravitating toward candidates or working to peel off supporters from other papal contenders.
Once inside the Sistine Chapel, the Vatican's chamberlain — a position filled by Benedict's former second in command, the embattled Cardinal Tarcisio Bertone — will declare “extra omnes.” At that moment, everyone without a vote exits, leaving the cardinals alone with Michelangelo's frescoes and ballots reading “Eligo in summum pontificem” (“I elect as supreme pontiff”) across the top.
The most senior cardinals go first, holding the folded ballot up for their colleagues to see as they kneel at the altar, pray and declare, “My vote is given to the one who before God I think should be elected.” One by one, the cardinals will drop the papers into a silver and gilded bronze urn — recently revealed to the Vatican press corps in a short video — and an official sews the ballots together with a thread tied to a needle that pierces through the word “Eligo.”
Eventually, one of those ballot counts next week could cross the threshold of 77 votes for one of the cardinals, prompting a puff of white smoke (thanks to the addition of some chemicals) from the Sistine Chapel's chimney when the ballots are burned. A cardinal would then come to the balcony of St. Peter's and introduce the new pope, cloaked in white, with a cry of “Habemus Papam.”
The cardinals voted early Friday to accept the absence from the conclave of two voting-age cardinals who had said they would not attend. The first, a cardinal from Jakarta, Indonesia, asked to be excused because of health problems. The second is Cardinal Keith O'Brien of Scotland, who in recent weeks was accused of and admitted to inappropriate sexual behavior toward priests. When O'Brien announced his resignation as head of the Catholic Church in Scotland last month, he said he would not participate in the conclave.
The Feb. 28 abdication of Benedict XVI, now known as pope emeritus, injected an unusual dose of uncertainty into a process traditionally governed by funeral rituals, homilies and masses.
Benedict was the first pope in nearly 600 years not to die in office. Usually, the conclave to select a new pope begins after a 15-day period of mourning the previous pope's death.
In the absence of funeral rites, public attention in recent days has focused on matters of logistics and media access. The Vatican spent much of the past week answering questions about the vagaries of Benedict's eleventh-hour amendment to an apostolic constitution and whether all voting-age cardinals needed to be in attendance before the college could decide on a conclave start date. (Cardinals who are younger than 80 at the time the papacy became vacant are eligible to vote. The 115th and final voting-age cardinal to participate in the election, a Vietnamese prelate, arrived Thursday.)
The start date of this conclave had become a source of debate among cardinals, with some factions believing they would benefit from an earlier election and others pushing for a longer preliminary period that would allow more time for less-familiar candidates to emerge.
Media restrictions imposed by the College of Cardinals put a sudden and unexpected end to daily news conferences that were being held by American cardinals, drawing media attention to the Vatican's censorship rather than the major themes the cardinals have been discussing.
On Friday morning, 18 more cardinals spoke at the closed meeting, bringing the total who have addressed the college to more than 100. The Rev. Federico Lombardi, a Vatican spokesman, said they discussed interreligious dialogue, bioethics, justice in the world and the importance of positive announcement of the Gospel.
During the meeting, they also learned of an “adopt a cardinal” Web site where 220,000 people have logged on to pray for one of the 115 voting cardinals.
Angelo Sodano, the dean of the College of Cardinals, who is more than 80 years old and therefore cannot enter or vote in the conclave, said that he hoped the Web site was for all of the cardinals, not just the electors.
During Friday's news conference, Lombardi showed a film of the hotel on Vatican grounds where the cardinals will stay during the election. “We are getting close to the conclave,” he said.

A controversial study that found there has been no slowdown in global warming has been supported by new research.
Many researchers had accepted that the rate of global warming had slowed in the first 15 years of this century.
But new analysis in the journal Science Advances replicates findings that scientists have underestimated ocean temperatures over the past two decades.
With the revised data the apparent pause in temperature rises between 1998 and 2014 disappears.
The idea of a pause had gained support in recent years with even the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) reporting in 2013 that the global surface temperature "has shown a much smaller increasing linear trend over the past 15 years than over the past 30 to 60 years".
But that consensus was brought into question by a number of studies, of which a report by the the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa) published in Science last year was the most significant.
Researchers from Noaa suggested that the temperatures of the oceans were being consistently underestimated by the main global climate models.
The authors showed that the ocean buoys used to measure sea temperatures tend to report slightly cooler temperatures than the older ship-based systems.
Back in the 1990s, ship measurements made up the vast majority of the data, whereas now the more accurate and consistent buoys account for 85% of measurements.
Image copyright Zeke Hausfather Image caption The new analysis of buoy and satellite data shows that ocean temperatures have increased steadily since the 1990s
When the researchers corrected the data to take this "cold bias" into account, they concluded that the oceans had warmed 0.12C per decade since 2000, nearly twice as fast as previous estimates of 0.07 degrees.
As a result, the authors said that the warming experienced in the first 15 years of the 21st Century was "virtually indistinguishable" from the rate of warming between 1950-99, a time generally acknowledged to have seen significant rates of warming from human emissions of CO2.
The study did not go down well with climate sceptics. Members of the US House of Representatives subpoenaed the author's emails which Noaa refused to hand over.
However, this new analysis supports the findings of the Noaa report. The scientists involved believe the problems in the original temperature estimates for the oceans came from attempting to mesh together data from ships and buoys.
"Only a small fraction of the ocean measurement data is being used by climate monitoring groups, and they are trying to smush together data from different instruments, which leads to a lot of judgement calls about how you weight one versus the other, and how you adjust for the transition from one to another," said Zeke Hausfather, the new paper's lead author.
Hausfather and colleagues decided to put together three independent data sets from satellites, buoys and robotic floats to find the true scale of ocean warming, so there was no mixing or matching of data.
"Our approach was to create three separate ocean temperature records from the three different instruments, and it turns out that all three agree really well with the new Noaa record," he said.
"The conclusion is that Noaa got it right, the scientists at Noaa were not cooking the books or manipulating the data in any way and that three independent sets of data back up their results."
The controversy that surrounded the original paper proved a strong motivation for attempting to replicate the findings says another author, Dr Kevin Cowtan from the University of York.
"We were initially sceptical of the Noaa result, because it showed faster warming than a previous updated record from the UK Met Office. So we set out to test it for ourselves, using different methods and different data. We now think Noaa got it right, and a new dataset from the Japan Meteorological Agency also agrees."
The new study is unlikely to quieten sceptics but the authors say their new work shows that the rate of warming in the last two decades is no different from the rate of warming since 1970 or from 1950.
As for attempts by politicians to subpoena emails in an attempt to suggest that scientists are committing fraud, the idea gets short shrift from the new paper's authors.
"If people disagree with things they should ask other scientists to look into it rather than demanding access to scientists' emails," said Zeke Hausfather.

Montreal fireplaces may need to be put out four years earlier than expected.
While the City of Montreal already had a plan in place to restrict the use of fireplaces starting in 2020, an environmental committee studying the issue is recommending pushing the plan forward to October 2016.
Roughly 50,000 homes would be affected.
Mayor Denis Coderre must first decide to go ahead with the proposal, under which devices that don't meet the emission standard of 2.5 grams per hour of fine particles per hour would be affected.
"These fine particles have significant and detrimental impact. Higher mortality rates, cancer, respiratory problems, " said Elsie Lefebvre, a city councillor and head of the committee.
Citizens would have 18 months to comply with the regulations if their current device does not meet the restrictions.
Those who don't could face fines ranging from $100 to $4,000.
The city banned wood burning appliances for new constructions in 2009.
Wood stoves and fireplaces are one of the leading causes of winter smog in Montreal, according to Environment Canada.
Days after the NAACP clashed with Tea Party members over allegations of racism, a video has surfaced showing an Agriculture Department official regaling an NAACP audience with a story about how she withheld help to a white farmer facing bankruptcy -- video that now has forced the official to resign.
Shirley Sherrod, the department's Georgia director of Rural Development, is shown in the clip describing "the first time I was faced with having to help a white farmer save his farm." Sherrod, who is black, claimed the farmer took a long time trying to show he was "superior" to her. The audience laughed as she described how she determined his fate.
"He had to come to me for help. What he didn't know while he was taking all that time trying to show me he was superior to me was I was trying to decide just how much help I was going to give him," she said. "I was struggling with the fact that so many black people have lost their farmland and here I was faced with having to help a white person save their land -- so I didn't give him the full force of what I could do. I did enough."
The Agriculture Department announced Monday, shortly after FoxNews.com published its initial report on the video, that Sherrod had resigned.
"There is zero tolerance for discrimination at USDA, and I strongly condemn any act of discrimination against any person," Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack said in a written statement. "We have been working hard through the past 18 months to reverse the checkered civil rights history at the department and take the issue of fairness and equality very seriously.
The NAACP released a statement late Monday condemning Sherrod's admission.
"We are appalled by her actions, just as we are with abuses of power against farmers of color and female farmers," the statement said.
"Her actions were shameful," it continued. "While she went on to explain in the story that she ultimately realized her mistake, as well as the common predicament of working people of all races, she gave no indication she had attempted to right the wrong she had done to this man."
Sherrod explained in the video that, at the time, she assumed the state or national Department of Agriculture had referred the white farmer to her. In order to ensure that the farmer could report back that she was indeed helpful, she said she took him to see "one of his own" -- a white lawyer.
"I figured that if I take him to one of them, that his own kind would take care of him," she said.
The point of the story wasn't entirely clear; only an excerpt of the speech is included in the video clip.
"It was revealed to me that it's about poor versus those who have," she said, suggesting she had learned that race is less important.
The video clip was first posted by BigGovernment.com. The clip is dated March 27 from an NAACP Freedom Fund banquet.
The clip adds to the firestorm of debate over the NAACP's decision to approve a resolution at its convention last week accusing some Tea Party activists of racism -- a charge Tea Party leaders deny.
In a second clip from the same event posted online, Sherrod appeared to urge black job seekers to find work at the Department of Agriculture because the federal government won't lay people off.
"There are jobs at USDA and many times there are no people of color to fill those jobs because we shy away from agriculture. We hear the word agriculture and think, why are we working in the fields?" she said. "You've heard of a lot of layoffs. Have you heard of anybody in the federal government losing their job? That's all I need to say."
Former Arsenal and French international midfielder Robert Pirès has confirmed he is to visit Kenya where he will be hosted by four lucky families in December, replacing his former club-mate and English international Tony Adams who has had to withdraw through illness.
Pirès who part of the Gunners' famous ‘invincible' squad which completed the Barclays Premier League 2003-04 season. His six year career at Arsenal saw him lift three FA Cup titles and two Premier Leagues titles in 2001-02 and 2003-04 seasons, scoring 84 goals in 284 appearances.
After Arsenal, he moved to Villarreal and retired in 2011 after brief stint with Aston Villa. Despite being 42, Pirgs was still turning out for FC Goa in India last season.
“The Barclays Premier League is without a doubt the biggest and the best league in world football. “I'm still an avid supporter and I cannot wait to join Barclays in Kenya to share these unique experiences with them.” Robert Pirès
His Kenyan visit will last for two days (December 4-6), during which he will join 100 lucky Barclays' customer winners from the the ‘Switch to Better' promotion for an exclusive Premier League Fan Zone viewing experience.
Pirès will also spend time with four lucky winners and their families who will also win an English Premier League football team kit of their choice.
In order to participate, entrants need to open a Barclays account and transfer their salary into this account each month.
Customers who register for online banking stand a chance of winning two tickets to a VIP Premier League Fan Zone with the Gunners' legend.
“At Barclays we take pride in connecting our customers on the African continent through their shared passion for the beautiful game. We are the only bank in Africa able to reward its customers with once in a lifetime experiences through our longstanding sponsorship of the EPL”, Barclays Bank of Kenya Director of Consumer Banking, Zahid Mustafa said. “We cannot wait to welcome Robert Pirès to Kenya to share in our passion for football and to experience our African hospitality.”
Pirès will join Barclays Bank of Kenya in the launch of the Spaces for Sports Initiative, a Ksh. 47m partnership with the International Youth Foundation, envisioned to empower the next generation using their sporting talent.
The program, which will be implemented through Mathare Youth Sports Association will provide the youth with skills, confidence and the experience they need to secure social independence.
Customers have until November 20 to participate in the ‘Switch to Better' promotion.
Strictly Rhetorical Question: Why Does the Media Not Report That ISIS Was Defeated in Iraq and Its Capital City of Raqqa in Syria Has Been Captured by US-Allied Troops? I would imagine for much the same reason the media is silent on the economy. Though this is consistent: after all, the media was largely silent on the economy and ISIS under Obama, too. For different reasons, of course. Though this is consistent: after all, the media was largely silent on the economy and ISIS under Obama, too. For different reasons, of course. Trump needs to give a primetime address or something to note these things. I guess he can wait until the State of the Union, but... Trump needs to give a primetime address or something to note these things. I guess he can wait until the State of the Union, but... Remember how debates about ISIS dominated the presidential primaries? Remember how Donald Trump and Ted Cruz ratcheted up their rhetoric until they both seemed to promise that they'd commit war crimes like carpet bombing and torture to defeat the deadly threat? ISIS was often the most important and most prominent story in the world. Now, however, the caliphate is a smoking ruin. It courted conflict with the great powers. It craved Armageddon, and it got its wish. No one knows ISIS's exact casualty figures, but its fighters have died by the tens of thousands. I�ve spoken to men who were directly involved in the air campaign, and they have told me that the public doesn't yet understand the sheer scale and ultimate effectiveness of the American attacks. Yes, we withdrew from Iraq too soon. Yes, our counteroffensive against ISIS unfolded slowly. But we fought back, we trained and equipped allies, and we won. This is one of the best stories of the young Trump administration. While many of the battles were fought under Obama, Trump pursued the enemy relentlessly. He delegated decision-making to commanders in the field, they fought within the laws of war, and they prevailed. Trump promised to defeat ISIS, and he has delivered a tremendous victory. Part of the blame still rests with us. Let's be honest: Panic and fear make for a better story than victory and peace. So why isn�t this bigger news?

Saturday
3. ­Art and Coffee, 11 a.m.
Curious about the artistic talent emerging from this region of India? Then a visit to the Kalakriti Art Gallery at Banjara Hills Road No.10 is a requisite. Here, you'll browse works by B. Srinivas Reddy, Kauser Qureshi, Balaji Ponna and Muktinath Mondal — but first, brunch. At the adjacent Gallery Café, choose from ice cream waffles (150 rupees), a corn-and-spinach focaccia sandwich (160 rupees) or a paneer-paratha-tortilla wrap (180 rupees). Just be sure to have your cappuccino (90 rupees) with a slice of cardamom-spiced carrot cake (80 rupees).
4. ­Fashion Finds, 1 p.m.
While Hyderabadi attire is synonymous with opulent threadwork, heavy tiers of silk and gilded beading, the contemporary fashion scene is evolving as well. Almari (“closet”) is a glossy showroom for top fashion designers from around the country, and the glittery blouses and purses suspended from the ceiling give the space a gallery-like feel. For a more traditional ambience, head to Manomay, an opulent boutique modeled after the 18th-century Chowmahalla Palace in Hyderabad's Old City. The warren of rooms is the setting for designs by Astha Narang, Kiran Uttam Ghosh, Ranna Gill and more, and the interior's Old World details are thoughtfully conceived: An antique palanquin serves as a showcase; an intricately carved bookshelf doubles as a shoe rack.
5. ­Royal Reprieve, 3 p.m.
From a faux palace, make your way to a real one. The late-19th-century Falaknuma Palace stands high atop a hill overlooking Hyderabad's Old City, but it might well be from another world altogether:The architecture and interiors are an unexpected mix of English, Venetian, Japanese, French, Chinese and Moghul influences. The opulent estate once served as a guesthouse for royal visitors of the Nizam, Hyderabad's fabulously wealthy erstwhile ruler; in 2010 it was transformed into one of India's finest palace hotels. Even if an overnight stay is a touch too pricey, you can always make a reservation for a meal and request a guided tour. Afternoon tea (2,250 rupees a person) begins at 3:30 at the Celeste restaurant, near the Gol Bungalow terrace with its gilded dome. Choose from an English high tea with sandwiches and biscuits or a Nizami version with samosas and pakoras; either repast is fit for a king. Visitors need a reservation for tea or for a meal at one of the restaurants to make it past the gates.
6. ­A View Worth the Climb, 5 p.m.
At the heart of Hyderabad's Old City, Charminar, an archway and mosque constructed in 1591 by the then-ruler Mohammad Quli Qutub Shah to commemorate the end of a plague outbreak, is Hyderabad's most widely recognized landmark — there's even a gilded tribute erected in the city's ultramodern IT hub, about 13 miles away. Make a circuit around the structure, admiring its intricate domes and minarets hewed from limestone and granite, but be sure to climb to the top for a panoramic late-afternoon view over the chaotic lanes of the old city below. It's a fairly easy walk up (albeit through an ancient and very congested staircase), and admission is a mere 100 rupees per person for non-Indians.
7. ­Glittering Gifts, 6 p.m.
Despite its landlocked location, Hyderabad is lovingly referred to as the City of Pearls, thanks to its bustling jewelry trade. And while diamond mines outside the city may have unearthed some of the world's most famous diamonds — the Kohinoor and Hope among them — there is bling for every budget on offer in Hyderabad. In one of the lively arteries off the Charminar, Laad Bazaar is famed for its glittery glass bangles in every conceivable color and pattern; don't leave the city without at least an armful, either for yourself or as an inexpensive gift.
8. ­Throwback Dining, 8 p.m.
Many Indians lament the decline of the beloved Irani cafe; the team behind the ultrahip SodaBottleOpenerWala went ahead and reinvented one. The original Irani cafes were once a mainstay in Mumbai's Parsi community, thanks to their lively ambience and staples like berry pulao (rice with vegetables, nuts and berries) and bun-maska (bread and butter). The playful SodaBottleOpenerWala, a chain with outposts in Delhi, Hyderabad, Mumbai and Bangalore, is a whimsical tribute to retro cafe culture, from the throwback interiors (checkerboard floors, vintage photographs, an old jukebox) to the food (eggs kejriwal, mutton dhansak, kheema pav). Dinner will come to less than 2,000 rupees for two.
Mourinho will make me an even better player, enthuses Ozil
The 23-year-old Germany international believes that he already works harder and contributes more from a defensive perspective because of the Portuguese coach
The Germany international's arrival at the Santiago Bernabeu coincided with that of the Portuguese, and the playmaker feels that the Blancos coach has improved his work rate and defensive qualities, but not to the detriment of his attacking capabilities.
"I have not lost anything in adapting to Mourinho's tactical discipline," Ozil told El Pais. "Forwards also must work. I have become more active and Mou will improve me even more.
"He has given me confidence and I am very grateful to him. I feel very comfortable there and that is why I have been able to play so well in recent seasons."
Ozil also revealed that Madrid captain Iker Casillas has also played an integral role in his impressive adaptation to the Spanish game.
"In Madrid, he is a legend and also a good friend who helps you in every way he can," he explained.
However, the former Werder Bremen man admitted that he has also been greatly influenced by two players currently plying their trade at Barcelona.
"I identify with Xavi and [Andres] Iniesta in the way we feel the football," he continued. "They are both very intelligent and their possession of the ball is incredible."

Call The Midwife nuns are atheists
Bang Showbiz
22 December 2014
Pam Ferris, Judy Parfitt and Jenny Agutter - who all star as nuns in 'Call The Midwife' - have revealed that they are atheists
Some of the stars of 'Call The Midwife' don't believe in God.
Pam Ferris, Judy Parfitt and Jenny Agutter - who play nuns in the BBC One show - have revealed that they are all atheists.
Judy - who plays Sister Monica Joan - said: "I'm against organised religion. It's caused more trouble than anything else in the world.
"How can these people go around saying their terrible actions are in the name of God? It's a joke."
Jenny - who stars as Sister Julienne - added: "It's very hard to have a faith when you see all the terrible things that are going on in the world."
Pam, 66, plays Sister Evangelina in the show and has admitted that she has trouble "pretending" there is something above reality.
She said: "I am an atheist. I have enough trouble dealing with reality as I see it, observe it and feel it, without pretending there's another layer that we all have to agree on."
When asked if her ability to play a nun on the show is affected by her own beliefs, she added to The Sun newspaper's TV Biz column: "How do I balance being an atheist and playing a nun?
"Well, I don't have to be a murderer to commit a murder on screen!"
About
When a Utah Country Boy and a transplanted California City Girl “meat”, what happens is tasty magic and Boy Meats Girl Jerky is born. Our all-natural meat jerky is bold in flavor and super yummy. We have come together to blend Scott's artisan jerky skills with Ana's love of bold flavors and spice combinations to create a unique and delicious product. It's truly a coming together of two different worlds to make one awesome jerky.
It is no secret that we are big jerky junkies. It is in many ways a perfect snack—high in protein, low in fat, and just bursting with yummy, meaty flavor. However, we were very disappointed in the quality of product we found on store shelves. We wanted jerky that was as good as the stuff we made at home; and we wanted it at a reasonable price. Scott has been making jerky for years—a skill he mastered as an outdoorsman. Ana has been experimenting with different flavorings and seasonings for just as long—always trying new flavors and creating special blends inspired by the world's flavors. When we combined our skills, the result was jerky nirvana. We have developed several flavor and meat combinations (with Scott's hunting background we could not just stick to beef), and we will launch with a variety of exotic game, beef, buffalo, and even an amazing pork jerky.
perfecting the recipe makes for a fun work day!
Regardless of the flavor, our jerky is always made with quality meat. Each variety is specially blended with just the right mix of salty, spicy, sweet, and umami. We use an all-natural preserving process that leaves the meat with just the right amount of bite—not too dry and not too moist. We never use MSG. We are most excited to be offering limited-edition flavors and highlighting tastes from around the world with flavors like Filipino Adobo, Chipotle, Thai Spice, Korean BBQ, and more.
All our meats are locally raised and all production is done here in the US, helping to boost our own economy. We are already USDA inspected and approved so we are able to ship our product to anyone who wants it. Boy Meats Girl is committed to helping our own local economy. As our dreams come true, it is of the utmost importance for us to give back to our community. With the exception of a limited amount of our imported spices, everything is homegrown or made in the US. All of our packaging, labeling, T-shirts, and other fun BMG items are produced right here in the US. Like we already mentioned, we support local agriculture by sourcing out meat locally using small, sustainable, and responsible farmers and ranchers. It is our commitment to you to be a positive part of the community and to always support other small businesses, growers, and producers all over the US
We have everything ready to begin production. We have our recipes in place, our producer ready for the go signal, packaging designed, and our love of jerky ready to share with the world. We will also be running a Jerky Junkies jerky of the month club. (Details below) We need your Kickstarter help to make our meaty dream a reality—and to make your meaty dreams come true.

After a decade in which Italian politics was dominated by showgirls and sleaze, Beppe Grillo's brand of web-based democracy and anti-corruption campaigning has been taking Italy by storm, and his movement became Sicily's biggest party in regional elections last weekend and came second in nationwide polls.
But the tousle-haired comedian and blogger has now been dragged into a very familiar sounding Italian row after he was accused of being a "medieval" sexist and no different to politician Silvio Berlusconi.
At first glance, Grillo appears the antithesis of the permatanned former prime minister, who packed his TV shows and his cabinet with showgirls and passed around a phallic statue to break the ice at his famous bunga bunga parties. But the comedian's non-sexist credentials were called into question when Federica Salsi, a local councillor representing his Five-Star Movement in Bologna, appeared on a TV talk show, ignoring Grillo's strict instructions to his councillors to stay off TV and stick to the internet.
Reacting angrily to her appearance on TV, Grillo likened the lure of television to "the G-spot, which gives you an orgasm in talk-show studios. It is Andy Warhol's 15 minutes of fame. At home, your friends and relations applaud emotionally as they share the excitement of a brief moment of celebrity."
Forty-year-old Salsi was quick to fight back, calling Grillo's outburst "disappointing", adding: "He has shown himself to be a victim of the Berlusconi culture … a chauvinist like the others."
Grillo's reference to the G-spot, she said, gave "a negative connotation to a quality women have" – and that, she concluded, "is medieval, really degrading".
Salsi was backed up by another Five-Star councillor, Raffaella Pirini, who said: "She did well, she said the right things."
The row vividly recalled the years in which Berlusconi's TV channels featured leering male game show hosts flirting with semi-naked dancing girls, while the tycoon-turned-politician's cabinet ministers appeared in public with attractive young women on their arm.
Since Berlusconi stepped down last November, replaced by a government of technocrats led by sober academic Mario Monti, lewd TV advertising has been toned down, Miss Italy contestants have been ordered to show less flesh and the new, female, head of the state TV network demanded daytime hosts put a stop to endless discussions of plastic surgery.
Grillo's visceral loathing of the rowdy talk shows aired nightly on Italian TV is based on the idea that they give visibility to the caste of professional politicians his movement is seeking to oust. Grillo himself was banned from state TV in 1987 after joking about government corruption, prompting him to take his routine to live audiences and build his blog into one of the world's biggest.
But his belief in online democracy, where policy is shaped by his supporters in web forums, could be challenged as more of them gain elected office and are tempted by invitations from chat shows.
Fifteen more took office as regional councillors in Sicily after regional elections last weekend, which saw Grillo's movement poll 285,000 votes to become Sicily's largest party, even if it lost out to a coalition between the centre-left and centrist parties.
After swimming the Strait of Messina to kick off a series of rallies across Sicily, Grillo told a crowd: "The police vote for us because they are fed up with driving politicians to do shopping or have sex."
Compared with a 2008 election on the island, Berlusconi's party lost 654,000 votes in the election, which came two days after he was convicted of tax fraud.
Grillo's leading candidate in Sicily said the movement would not now be tempted by backroom alliances with other parties, preferring to be "bitter spinsters who never have boyfriends". He also announced that he and his fellow councillors would hand back a portion of the inflated salaries that local politicians in Sicily are paid.
Now, with one pollster predicting that the Five-Star Movement could become the biggest party in Italy, Grillo will be eagerly awaiting regional elections due in Lazio and Lombardy, where the reputations of the local authorities have been ravaged by corruption scandals.Then, next spring, national elections are due as Monti steps down. Grillo has not stood for office himself to date but, in a video posted on his blog this week, he called himself a "political leader" of the movement for the first time and added: "We are about to confront something extraordinary."
Sitting at a desk covered in piles of paper in front of a guitar propped against the wall, the comedian warned: "It will be an epochal change, tough, and we will make mistakes, I will make mistakes, you will accuse me of everything."
But, he asked, "instead of hammering us, give us advice, a hand, we need both".
So I have recently moved from Florida (80 degrees, wall-to-wall sunshine, sea breezes, pelicans and dolphins) to Liverpool (frozen lake, not quite wall-to-wall sunshine, bracing wind, swans and Lambananas.)
Just now I was scooting down the stairs to the World Peace Café that is conveniently placed inside the large house I'm living in, meaning I don't have to go outside, ever, if I don't want to. At 3.48pm, it is already getting dark out there, and I was wondering whether to feel sorry for myself when I ran into J on the stairs.
“How are you doing, J?” “Great, thanks.” “What about this getting dark at 3.30, then?” “Oh, I love it! I love the winter.” “You do?!” “Yes, I love it. I love the spring and the summer too.” “Hmmm. I daresay you love the Fall, erm Autumn, as well?” “Oh yes, I love it! I love all four seasons.” Just as I was pondering mentally how anyone could love winter with such enthusiasm, and perhaps he had nothing to compare it with, he added, “I lived in Fort Lauderdale and Miami for three years when I was younger, and it was lovely, but I really missed the seasons!”
“Well”, I told him, “That really shows how everything depends on the mind! And now I'm going to love the four seasons too.” So, dear reader, if you catch me complaining, please remind me of this conversation. As a friend told me the other day, there is no such thing as bad weather, only the wrong clothes. (It reminded us of Shantideva's famous analogy about leather on the feet.)
In the last article on delusions, I talked about the object of delusion. While our delusions are still rampant, there is not an awful lot we can do about objects of delusion. Geshe Kelsang sums this up:
Even if we were to live in an isolated cave there would be some parts of the cave that would appear more attractive than other parts, and some kinds of weather that would seem more pleasant than others. We would soon find ourselves preferring this sort of birdsong to that sort of birdsong, and we would still have all the memories of other objects of delusion. ~ Understanding the Mind
It sounds like a pretty nice idea to me: “I'm going to get away from it all, get away from all these trying people and/or objects of temptation that surround me wherever I go. I'll go to the countryside on retreat, or on top of a mountain in Brazil or Switzerland, or perhaps even a cave in the Himalayas. Hey, that's awesome, that's the answer!”
Actually, it can be very helpful to go away sometimes from our usual environment and work on our minds, for example in meditation retreat. January is retreat month in the New Kadampa Tradition and it provides a refreshing and significant start to the year. However, by itself, getting away from it all is not going to solve the problem because, as they say, wherever we go, there we are. Our deluded mind comes along for the ride.
Cause of delusion # 3, inappropriate attention
As mentioned in this first article on the delusions, there are six causes of our delusions. These are like a chain that bind us to suffering and problems. To break a chain, especially one as strong as this, it makes sense to find its weakest link.
We just saw how the object is not the weakest link – it is hard to isolate ourselves from all objects of delusion because they are going to pop up wherever we take our deluded minds. We can run, but we cannot hide. Sooo, what to do?
Now we come to the weakest link in the chain that binds us to suffering, insofar as it is the easiest one for us to break at the moment. This is very lucky for us. We can work on all six causes of our problems to a certain extent, of course, but this is the one where we can really get in there and stop the course of the delusion.
I keep saying a delusion is an unpeaceful, uncontrolled mind, and this is true, but strictly speaking the actual definition of a delusion is “An unpeaceful, uncontrolled mind that arises from inappropriate attention.” Even if our mind meets an object of anger, say, we will only get angry if we let inappropriate attention develop.
Inappropriate attention is that function of honing in on a jelly donut, for example, and exaggerating its power to make our day, or honing in on someone who annoys us and letting our peace be destroyed ostensibly by that person but actually by our inappropriate attention toward that person.
There are many levels of inappropriate attention, from very subtle to very gross. At the moment, whenever we see an object we naturally apprehend it as being inherently existent, as independent of the mind, nothing to do with us. This itself is an exaggeration and the most subtle form of inappropriate attention. It is also our ignorance of self-grasping.
Because we are grasping at things as if they were outside the mind, we then believe that their apparent desireability or distastefulness inhere in them, and have nothing to do with the way we are perceiving them. If something out there looks nice, we naturally want to pull it toward us, and attachment is born. If something out there looks nasty, we naturally want to push it away from us, and anger or aversion is born. Due to our initial exaggeration of the object's ontological status as being inherently existent as opposed to a mere projection of our mind, like a dream object, we then engage in even more exaggeration: “That donut out there on the cake dish is really nice (ie, from its own side) – just look at that red jelly oozing out of it, and the sugar sprinklings, and think how well it will go with the Cappuchino from the World Peace Café downstairs?!” This is gross inappropriate attention, leading to attachment.
We can overcome subtle inappropriate attention with wisdom, and we can overcome gross inappropriate attention with mindfulness, alertness, and conscientiousness, applying the opponents to delusions as described here.

People Trashing Amy Schumer Are Sexist, She's Really Funny for a Chick
Alright, listen up fuck boi's and mansplainers — it's time to put your toxic masculinity away, check your privilege, and admit that Amy Schumer is undeniably hilarious for a chick.
Let's look at the facts. In less than a decade Amy has produced three stands up specials, a successful movie, and starred in her own TV show. In comparison, most of the chicks I went to high school with barely do anything.
Feminism: 1; Men's Rights Activists: 0.
The biggest, and obviously sexist, criticism is the sexual nature of Amy's jokes. What's the matter, patriarchy? Can't stand to hear a woman talk openly about her vagina for 60 minutes? Wow, I guess masculinity is as fragile as they say. Plus, everybody knows women aren't inherently funny so she deserves credit for even trying.
And so what if her act is nothing but, “basic humor” and, “one note jokes” — she is a massive star. She needs to appeal to EVERYBODY. You know what other huge stars also use broad humor? How about respected MALE comedians Dane Cook and Carlos Mencia?
Did that just blow your mind? It's OK, I'll wait while you do a spit take and choke on your red pill.
All done? I'll continue…
Now, I admit there are concerns raised over Amy Schumer possibly stealing material from other comedians. But that's nothing compared to stories I've read online about women taking things from men, like most of their net worth, houses, and even custody of their kids! Compared to those bitches, Amy barely stole anything.
Related: Hey You, Crowd Killing. Get Your Dick Inside Me. Now.
Aww did some little girl steal your favorite comedian's joke-e-woke-es and hurt your little man fee-fees? Sack up, pussy — It's 2017 where feminism is KING.
When it comes to women's issues, I'm someone you can trust, I've been to several gender equality seminars pertaining to sexism in the workplace, catcalling in the workplace, and sexual harassment in the workplace — all paid for by my work! So I basically have a Ph.D in babes.
Amy Schumer is undeniably funny for a chick. It's all really pretty easy to understand, I'm not sure why feminists didn't ask a man to explain all this earlier.
Do you think Amy Schumer is funny for a chick? Let us know in the comments below.

Bill Maher defended Rush Limbaugh's freedom of speech, and then defended his defense of Rush Limbaugh's freedom of speech. He did not defend Rush Limbaugh himself; he says he still thinks Rush is an asshole. And there is an important distinction to be made here, between defending somebody's right to say something and defending that person. But in defending Limbaugh's freedom of speech, was Maher defending the indefensible?
I'll get to what he said in a minute, but it is important to point out here that free speech is an ancient tradition, highly valued in the polytheistic world of Greece and Rome until Paganism was outlawed and Pagans banned from government. Free speech was not valued in the so-called Judeo-Christian world, which functioned on a list of “don'ts” rather than on the idea of freedoms. I was not until the European Enlightenment that freedom of speech again saw the light of day,this time championed by secularists, after being punished with arrest, torture and bonfires for the better part of fourteen centuries.
To put it bluntly, free speech is a liberal, not a conservative ideal and if anyone is going to value free speech, it should be liberals because without free speech, change will never take place and progress will never be made. Things will simply remain the same – conservatism's ideal of the status quo. But let's look at Maher's words.
This is what he tweeted on Tuesday, March 6:
“Hate to defend #RushLimbaugh but he apologized, liberals looking bad not accepting. Also hate intimidation by sponsor pullout.”
The thing is, Rush did not apologize. What he said was pretty far from an apology. And if you look not only at his words before but also at his words after, you can see he meant none of it. Limbaugh said it was humor, not slander that was intended, and Maher agrees that Limbaugh's words amount to an “unfunny joke” with a “disgusting sentiment.”
It can be wondered if Maher actually listened to what Limbaugh said. If there was a joke or intended humor in his hateful words, they are beyond detection. Sandra Fluke certainly didn't accept the “apology” and said so the day before Maher's tweet, on The View. Is Maher, the one who was not attacked, a better judge of what's a sufficient apology than Fluke, the victim of the attack?
Remember, this is what Limbaugh originally said on February 29:
“What does it say about the college co-ed Susan Fluke [sic] who goes before a congressional committee and essentially says that she must be paid to have sex — what does that make her? It makes her a slut, right? It makes her a prostitute. She wants to be paid to have sex. She's having so much sex she can't afford the contraception. She wants you and me and the taxpayers to pay her to have sex.”
Then, rather than apologize, he doubled down on the hate on March 1:
“If we are going to pay for your contraceptives, thus pay for you to have sex, we want something for it, and I'll tell you what it is: We want you to post the videos online so we can all watch.”
He also had this to say:
”I will buy all of the women at Georgetown University as much aspirin to put between their knees as they want.”
Only after this did he finally “apologize”. When Fluke did not accept it, he tried again on March 5, making his apology as much an attack as an apology. Reports Reuters:
“I acted too much like the leftists who despise me. I descended to their level, using names and exaggerations,” Limbaugh said. “It's what we've come to expect from them, but it's way beneath me.”
But then think about what Rush said next, not to Fluke this time, but to a female investigative journalist, Tracie McMilian, author of a book on America's food system, The American Way of Eating. This, on March 6, the same day Maher defended Limbaugh's right of free speech:
“What is it with all of these young, single, white women, overeducated – doesn't mean intelligent.”
This was another, if indirect attack on Sandra Fluke as well, student at prestigious Georgetown University. It doesn't sound to me as though Rush regrets – or is sorry for – what he said at all. He still believes it and is still saying it. What about this does Bill Maher not understand?
An insincere apology places no burden on the person offended to accept that apology. “Ooops, my bad” is as weak a mea culpa as can be imagined but one Rush did not even come close to approaching it since he did not admit doing anything wrong. His so-called apology was more along the lines of “I'm sorry you didn't see the humor in what I said about you.” An apology without an admission of wrong-doing is without value and no therefore no apology at all and any value an apology might have had disappears if the person continues to say the same thing afterward – we'll get to that in a minute.
As Yellow Dog Yankee wrote here yesterday, Bill Maher is wrong.
We must keep in mind when considering Maher's words that he has also been accused of misogyny, not only by the right but by the left.
Is it possible he is defending Rush as one misogynist to another? Maher says he is not a misogynist but then Rush Limbaugh also claims to be a “defender of women” and Rick Santorum says he is a champion of religious freedom. Anyone can be a misogynist, after all, even atheists, and liberals have to be careful to avoid idolizing their own icons too much, as conservatives tend to do theirs. A wrong is a wrong, no matter where it comes from, left or right. The weight of evidence is against both Limbaugh and Santorum. Is it also against Maher?
This much is clear: Rush Limbaugh was wrong. Bill Maher was wrong.
Caught between left and right, Maher spoke to both:
“I don't like it that people are made to disappear when they say something, or people try to make them disappear when they say something you don't like. That's America. Sometimes you're made to feel uncomfortable, okay?”
So it is permissible for Limbaugh to make Fluke and other women uncomfortable, but not fair for the rest of us to make Limbaugh uncomfortable? Actions do not have consequences? There is such a thing as cause and effect, and Limbaugh certainly must recognize this. We all, after all, have freedom of speech, not just Rush Limbaugh. He used his to ruin Sandra Fluke. We used ours to ruin Rush Limbaugh. Is there something somehow unfair about this?
Not from a Heathen perspective, I can tell you, where the rule of thumb is not “turn the other cheek” (which in any case should be Rush's position) but “return what is given.” From a Heathen perspective then, Rush Limbaugh got exactly what he deserved.
“And I hear people saying when they put pressure on his sponsors, ‘Oh, the system is working.' No, it's not. That's the system being manipulated.”
Is it possible that Limbaugh was also manipulating the system when he tried to destroy Sandra Fluke's life and reputation by calling her a slut and a whore? He is a powerful and influential figure on television and radio. He obviously took advantage of his position.
Now the thing is and this is a thing often forgotten, that if Limbaugh has a right to say the things he says, we have an equal right to respond, and an equal right to be offended by what he says. If Limbaugh has the right to slander a young woman who has done nothing but speak her own mind (and without slandering anybody, by the way) then we, as concerned human beings, have a right to respond.
What people also need to understand is that hate speech can be a form of violence. Where do we draw the line? Is it appropriate for Rush Limbaugh to call Sandra Fluke a slut for no other reason than she is in favor of contraception being a part of women's health care?
Should a person be excused from the consequences of their words, however hurtful, whatever the consequences? A person's life can be ruined, their career, their marriage, everyting they love and value and hold dear. Is that permissible? And if it is permissible, is it impermissible to take affront at such actions? It is hard to see how that could be.
Obviously, Limbaugh has a right to his opinions and Maher to his, and me to mine. That is how the system works. But there are certain standards of conduct with regards to civil discourse that should be observed, and insulting somebody simply on the grounds that they are a young, intelligent woman seems to me reprehensible. Rush's words might have been appropriate had she said that she took sex for money, but if insurance-supported contraception is prostitution then so is insurance-supported Viagara, isn't it? Aren't there then tens of millions of sluts of both sexes in this country?
I don't think most of us would agree. Rush violated accepted standards of conduct and simply put, he got what he deserved as a result. Maher might have had an argument were he arguing against a law against free speech, but no such law has been passed. What Rush faced was the voice of the people – vox populi – the essence of a free people and ironically enough a term often used in broadcasting. As I said, if Rush had a right to say it, we had a right to take offense and say something in response, and take offense we did, and then some.
Take that, Rush.
If you're ready to read more from the unbossed and unbought Politicus team, sign up for our newsletter here! Email address: Leave this field empty if you're human:
The voter information of more than 191 million Americans—including full names, dates of birth, home addresses, and more—was exposed online for anyone who knew the right IP address.
The misconfigured database, which was reportedly shut down at around 7pm ET Monday night, was discovered by security researcher Chris Vickery. Less than two weeks ago, Vickery also exposed a flaw in MacKeeper's database, similarly exposing 13 million customer records.
“Don't let anyone try to dismiss this as, ‘Oh, it's just mostly public records.'”
According to researchers, the voter database contained voters' names (first, middle, and last), home addresses, mailing addresses, phone numbers, dates of birth, sex, ethnicity, party affiliation, and whether the person voted in primary or general elections.
It did not, however, include Social Security numbers, driver's licenses numbers, or any financial records, according to sources with firsthand knowledge of the dataset. An “almost-complete” screenshot of a voter record, which was redacted to protect the voter's identity, reveals dozens of field entries containing an array of personal information.
In total, the leaky database contained more than 191,337,170 records, which dated as far back as 2000.
It was up wayyyyy too long though, I'm sure there'll be torrents up within hours — Hayden Schiff (@oxguy3) December 29, 2015
Its existence was first reported by Dissent, the pseudo-anonymous blogger at DataBreaches.net, and information-security journalist Steve Ragan. Both Vickery and Ragan confirmed locating their own personal data among the records. Vickery reportedly responded with outrage. “How could someone with 191 million such records be so careless?” he asked Ragan.
Attempting to locate the source, Ragan reached out to more than a half-dozen political firms, including Catalist, Political Data, Aristotle, and L2 Political. Each denied ownership of the IP address on which the database was found.
After noticing a few of the data field labels appeared to be proprietary, Vickery and Dissent reached out to NationBuilder, a company formerly overseen by Joe Green, an entrepreneur who years prior launched Causes.com, along with former Facebook president Sean Parker.
NationBuilder likewise denied ownership of the “inadvertently accessible” database in a statement on Monday, but added, nevertheless, it may correlate with data it gave freely to campaigns.
“We do not provide access to anyone for non-political purposes or that would violate any state's laws.”
“While the database is not ours, it is possible that some of the information it contains may have come from data we make available for free to campaigns,” said CEO Jim Gilliam, of the database found by Vickery. “From what we've seen, the voter information included is already publicly available from each state government so no new or private information was released in this database.”
Added Gilliam: “We strongly believe in making voter information more accessible to political campaigns and advocacy groups, so we provide cleaned versions of that publicly accessible information to them for free. We do not provide access to anyone for non-political purposes or that would violate any state's laws.”
“Don't let anyone try to dismiss this as, ‘Oh, it's just mostly public records,'” Dissent told the Daily Dot on Monday. In the wrong hands, she said, the database could put at risk law enforcement officers, domestic abuse victims, and employees whose bosses are staunchly partisan.
“Some voter information needs to be public record for accountability and to keep elections honest,” Dissent added, “but maybe party affiliation shouldn't be part of state voter registration anymore. Let people sign up with parties separately and let the parties keep their own lists.”
Both Dissent and Vickery reached out to the California Attorney General's Office for assistance, since California voters are among those exposed, as well as federal law enforcement.
Citing a policy intended to preserve the integrity of investigations, a spokesperson for Attorney General Kamala Harris would neither confirm nor deny her office was looking into the database. The Federal Bureau of Investigation declined to comment as well.
Dissent said she believes the database should catalyze a debate over whether there should be new rules about posting voting lists online. “One state, South Dakota, prohibits it,” she said. “Maybe the other states should follow their lead on that.”

This morning, CNBC's Jim Cramer made his first appearance on the Today show since his face-off with Jon Stewart last week. But Cramer ran into some more tough questioning from host Meredith Vieira.
"You had a rough week," she told Cramer. "[Stewart] was very tough on you, tough on CNBC, basically said you had been cheerleaders for the financial bubble and you also allowed CEOs to come on the shows and essentially lie to the American public without really challenging them. I don't want to rehash the whole thing, but didn't he have a point?"
Cramer said no and called it "a naive and misleading thing to attack the media."
"We weren't behind this. CNBC, in particular, has been out front on this," he argued. "I think there are people who bear so much more responsibility [than the media] that it's just wrong-headed -- the politicians, the regulators, the SEC, the lenders, the investment banks. ... It's just a naive focus, it really is Meredith."

Japan may still be recovering from earthquake-related woes, but that's not stopping Panasonic and eight partner companies from pushing ahead with their own rebuilding effort that could reshape the way future cities and towns are built. Part demonstration initiative and part reclamation project, Panasonic and friends are turning the footprint of one of the company's former factory sites into a 47-acre, 1,000-home "smart town" with energy- and eco-conscious considerations leading the development.
But the idea here isn't to create a town stripped to the bare minimum energy usage. Rather, by building the "Fujisawa Sustainable Smart Town"--Fujisawa City in Kanagawa Prefecture being the larger urban area here--with next-gen power-generating and power-saving infrastructure from the ground up, the companies plan to show just how green a town can be when various technologies are stacked together and work in unison.
As such, Fujisawa SST won't necessarily be home to never-before-seen, cutting-edge technologies, but to a variety of common green tech staples that, despite their availability, are expensive to retrofit into older buildings and towns.
For instance, every roof structure will be embedded with modern solar panel technology that both powers the house and banks unused energy in a home-based storage battery. Transportation infrastructure will be designed with electric vehicles in mind. Networked sensors all over town will control things like public lighting, ensuring wattage doesn't go to waste via a local smart grid.
Basically, Fujisawa SST is envisioned as a bottom-up approach to energy efficiency--a green village built from scratch with modern green technologies rather than less-efficient older tech. Panasonic wants to use it as a template for other larger communities in Japan and elsewhere. If all goes as planned, Fujisawa SST will start receiving residents in March of 2014 and finish filling up its houses by 2018.

Here are some old live tracks from a show we played with True North and Memory as Perfection in January of 2003 at Kurt and Craig's 829 House in Baton Rouge. The recording is a little shakey, but it definitely brings back some fun times at my favorite space for shows ever. Thank you, Michael Burton's brother for recording this show and so many others.
::
We broke up. Thanks to everyone who supported us.
Anyone who has photos or videotape of us, please get in touch. Here are over a hundred pictures from the last show thanks to Matt Roth. And here are a few cool pictures of our show in Goleta thanks to Chandler Briggs. Mp3s from the cd are now up in the section linked below.
If you want an actual cd, send $7 to: Bryan Funck | 1624 N. Starrett Rd. | Metairie, LA 70003. Or you can bring me five bucks in person.
Even though it's been a few years, we still might release the tracks we recorded with Chris George; hopefully, they will be on a split LP with our buddies Gathered Here (who are AMAZING). Chuck, Dave, and Steve had a band with Greg Stein called A Hunger Artist, but they broke up after the hurricane. Eric was in the Red Beards with Little James Hayes, Tate Carson, and Isidore Justin Grisoli; they put out an awesome CD and broke up, but I think Eric and Tate are working on a new band with our pal Eldon Ahrold. Eric is still playing with Tommy in PROMIS, with a bunch of our other friends in Rougarou, and touring with One Man Machine. After Katrina, Chuck moved up to DC and played in various bands with our Sterling-Richmond-DC buddies, including a hardcore band called Anchors and a great rock band called Pizza. He's since moved back to New Orleans and has been jamming with James Hayes (Red Beards) and Adam Bebe (Rougarou), and he also has a gore grind band called Elizabeth with Sean and Greg (As They Wept). I'm still living large in New Orleans. Me, Steve, and Eric are playing together again in our old band Chopsley with our buddies Steve Springer and Scott Francioni,and I also sing in this doomy sludge band called Thou with some Baton Rouge chaos wizards. And while I was in Oakland after the hurricane, I was in a band called Path of Daggers Crown of Swords with Jonathan West (Gathered Here), James Whitten (Structural Damage), Matt Leonard (An Arrow in Flight), and Dominic Sevieri (Days to Streaks); we never played any shows, but we recorded all our songs and you can download them from the site. Dave Janz, the smartest of the bunch, is moving out of New Orleans up to Tennessee to complete his medical school residency. Oh, and Dave and Steve were also playing in Scott's band Secret Passage with Eric; they have a bunch of amazing recordings that no one will ever hear, and they never play shows ever. That's the way to do it.
Our buddies Keith and Sean from Rat in a Bucket have a new band called Haarp who are great. And Brian Serpas and Justin Grisoli from the Faeries play in a rock band called Big Baby. Joey Gates from the Faeries is living out on the North Shore and doing an electro-volk project called Vargr Wulf. Mike Patton moved up to Nashville with most of his brothers and has a new pop band called The Loblaws.
Love always, Bryan.

How to Make Chicken Cauliflower Rice and Beans
In a food processor, add cauliflower in batches and process until “rice” forms. Just watch closely and do not over process into mush. Transfer to a bowl. Preheat large and deep non-stick skillet on medium – high heat and spray with cooking spray. Add cauliflower “rice” and cook for 3 – 4 minutes or until a bit golden, stirring frequently and watching closely not to burn. In the last minute of cooking add 1/2 tsp salt and a pinch of ground black pepper. Transfer to a bowl and set aside. Return skillet on medium heat and swirl olive oil to coat (If necessary scrape off small bits of cauliflower “rice”). Add onion, garlic and green bell peppers; cook for 7 minutes or so, stirring occasionally. Increase heat to medium – high, add chicken and cook for 5 more minutes, stirring occasionally. Add remaining salt, tomato sauce, black beans and Mina Harissa; stir and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low, cover and simmer for 10 more minutes. Remove from heat, stir in “rice” and sprinkle with green onions. Serve hot on its own or with extra brown rice for those extra hungry people, if desired.:)

It's honestly a little hard to believe that it's been more than two years since the release of Chad Stahelski and David Leitch's action masterpiece John Wick, but here we are. Released at the end of October with barely any hype at all in the months leading up to its release, the film rode the wave of a spectacular trailer and glowing reviews from festival screenings all the way to its release, where it quadrupled its $20 million budget at the box office and gained a cult following almost immediately. A sequel was greenlit shortly afterwards, and now that it's finally here, it's safe to say that John Wick: Chapter 2 is a worthy successor to the first film, an exhilarating theatrical experience that manages to expand the fascinating underworld of assassins that the original set up while not losing sight of the emotional through line of its title character.
Set two weeks after the first film, John Wick (Keanu Reeves) has gotten his car back, adopted an adorable (but nameless) pit bull puppy, and is ready to settle back into retirement. But before John can even go to sleep that night, Italian crime lord Santino D'Antonio (Riccardo Scamarcio) comes knocking on his door, ready to cash in a favor. With some coercion, Wick gets back in the game. But after he lands his target, D'Antonio betrays him and puts a bounty on his head, meaning that John has to headshot his way through all of New York City's best assassins in order to get his revenge.
Those poor bastards.
Chapter Two sees director Chad Stahelski flying solo for this outing, with the first film's co-director, David Leitch, going off to direct this summer's Cold War spy thriller The Coldest City. However, it's clear that Stahelski is as strong of a director on his own as he was with Leitch, because the direction is still top-notch. The budget has been doubled, and it clearly shows, because while the action fundamentally remains the same – clear, concise camera movements, practical stuntwork, bathing it all in neon lighting to give it a sense of other-worldliness not normally seen in this type of action movie – the scale of it is expanded. More of the action takes place in exterior locations, and even the action that takes place in interior settings gets a boost, resulting in memorable setpieces like an extended sequence in a subway station and the memorable climax at an art exhibit that leads to memorable images like the header photo for this review.
The split also doesn't seem to have effected Stahelski's work with actors that much, because the entire cast is great. The returning supporting players are all excellent in their brief amounts of screentime, with Ian McShane, John Leguizamo, Thomas Sadoski, and Lance Reddick all shinging. But the newer members of the ensemble are fantastic as well. Peter Stormare Stormares up the place as the late Viggo Tarasov's brother, Peter Serafinowicz kills it as a weapons dealer who uses wine terms to sell his wares, and Franco Nero himself shows up as the manager of the Rome branch of the Continental Hotel, and he easily has the best line in the whole film. But of the new additions, the real scene stealers are two mooks: Cassian and Ares, played by Common and Ruby Rose. Common's turn as an ex-security guard out to kill Wick is outstanding, playing a more serious take on his character in Jaume Collet-Serra's underseen Run All Night with absolute aplomb, and his fights with Wick are some of the best action beats in the whole film. And Ruby Rose is absolutely mesmerizing as Ares, a deaf assassin who rules the screen through sheer presence and sign language. This is the third franchise action film featuring Rose within the span of a month, and hopefully this leads to her profile being raised, because she absolutely deserves it.
And yes, Laurence Fishburne is in there as well, playing the leader of a group of homeless assassins called The Bowery King. Fishburne is clearly having a ball in the role, but outside of a number of spectacular one-liners, he doesn't really get that much to do. Hopefully he gets to make an appearance in Chapter 3, and that if he's there, he'll get to kick some ass.
But overall, this really is Keanu's film. John Wick is a character that I'd say was tailor-made for his strengths if I didn't know that it was originally written as a potential vehicle for Liam Neeson. The character exudes Keanu's trademark brand of cool while also exploiting his natural aloofness to sell the character's world-weary exterior and deep sadness. In fifty years, John Wick is probably going to be considered Keanu's defining character. That's how much he works in the role.
Despite suffering from pacing issues that weren't a problem in the previous film, which can probably be pegged on Chapter 2 being about twenty minutes longer than it, the movie is everything a John Wick fan would want a sequel to be. The action is sleek and well-choreographed, the cinematography, courtesy of Crimson Peak‘s Dan Laustsen, is gorgeous, the cast is full of character actors doing their character actor stuff turned up to eleven, and the humor is subtle, but effective. See it.
The Islamic State (ISIS) group chief Abu Bakr al- Baghdadi is still alive and leading the terrorist group, the Pentagon on Friday said.
Baghdadi has always kept a low profile and the last confirmed sighting of Baghdadi was in Mosul, soon after ISIS captured the city. Baghdadi has since then released several audio messages urging fighters to fight on. He recently released another audio tape in the wake of the Mosul battle, asking his supporters to defend the city of Mosul.
Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi is more wanted than ever before with a whopping $25 million on his head
It is, however, not clear whether the ISIS chief is in Mosul or not where the US-backed Iraqi army is battling the ISIS militants to retake the major city, which is a stronghold of the terrorist group.
"We do think Baghdadi is alive and is still leading ISIL and we are obviously doing everything we can to track his movements. If we get the opportunity, we certainly would take advantage of any opportunity to deliver him the justice he deserves...We're doing everything we can. This is something we're spending a lot of time on," Pentagon spokesperson Peter Cook told CNN.
The United States more than doubled the bounty on Baghdadi earlier this month to $25 million. The reward on the ISIS chief has placed him in the category, which has only one other occupant, the leader of al-Qaeda Ayman al-Zawahiri.
The State Department's "Rewards for Justice Program" in 2011 had offered an initial bounty of $10 million for the elusive militant. The ISIS has taken control of swathes of Syria and Iraq and according to a US "Wanted" poster have "gained the allegiance of jihadist groups and radicalised individuals around the world, and has inspired attacks in the United States."
"Under al-Baghdadi, ISIL has been responsible for the deaths of thousands of civilians in the Middle East, including the brutal murder of numerous civilian hostages from Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States," the State Department said.
"The group also has conducted chemical weapons attacks in Iraq and Syria in defiance of the longstanding global norm against the use of these appalling weapons, and has enabled or directed terrorist attacks beyond the borders of its self-declared caliphate," the department added.
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The wealthiest Americans would benefit the most from President Donald Trump's proposed tax cuts while many upper middle-income people would face higher taxes, independent experts said on Friday in the first detailed analysis of the plan.

A U.S. Senate panel took Trump's proposal, announced on Wednesday, a step forward by unveiling a budget plan for the coming fiscal year that acknowledges lost revenues from tax cuts, while Trump pressed ahead with selling the plan to the public.
A report from the non-profit Washington-based Tax Policy Center found that in 2018, about 12 percent of taxpayers would face a tax increase of roughly $1,800 on average.
That includes more than a third of taxpayers making between about $150,000 and $300,000, mainly because most itemized deductions would be repealed including for state and local taxes, it said.
Its analysis showed that the Republican tax proposal would fuel the growing federal deficit, providing $5.99 trillion in tax cuts while reducing federal revenues by a net $2.4 trillion in the next 10 years.
Trump, who promised major tax cuts as a candidate, has called his proposal “a miracle for the middle class,” but the report concluded it would provide middle-income taxpayers uneven tax relief. In 2018, all income groups would see their average taxes fall, but some taxpayers in each group would face tax increases, it found.
Taxpayers in the top 1 percent of incomes - above $730,000 - would receive about 50 percent of the total tax benefit from the tax overhaul, with their after-tax income forecast to increase an average of 8.5 percent, the group said.
“The biggest share of people with increased taxes will be ... people who might be considered upper-middle-income people, high-income professionals, people whose income is between $150,000 and $300,000 in a year in 2017,” Tax Policy Center co-director Eric Toder said.
The bottom 95 percent of taxpayers could expect a tax cut of 0.5 to 1.2 percent, according to the analysis.
The proposed tax cuts for corporations and small businesses would reduce federal revenue by $2.6 trillion over a decade and largely would benefit high-income taxpayers, it said.
Trump, a real estate mogul-turned-politician, had pledged that the tax plan would not benefit the rich, himself included.
BUDGET RESOLUTION
The budget resolution released by the Senate Budget Committee, which would pave the way for Republicans to avoid potential Democratic procedural moves to block it, builds in $1.5 trillion in reduced revenue from tax cuts over the next decade.
The White House and Republicans in Congress aim to have the tax proposal passed by the end of the year. Republicans control the White House, the Senate and both chambers of Congress.
The resolution is vital to plans by the Republicans to move tax legislation through the Senate, which they control by a slim 52-48 majority, using a parliamentary process that lets them pass legislation without a customary 60-vote threshold that would necessitate some Democratic support.
The proposal calls for slashing the corporate tax rate to 20 percent from 35 percent, the small business rate to 25 percent from 39.6 percent and the top individual rate to 35 percent from 39.6 percent.
Democrats call the tax plan a giveaway to the rich and corporations that would balloon the federal deficit.
“The Senate Republican budget is the clearest sign yet that Republicans are intent on pursuing a tax plan that would blow a huge hole in the deficit and stack up debt, leading to cuts in programs that middle-class Americans rely on,” Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said in a statement.
Trump talked up the tax proposal during a speech on Friday to the National Association of Manufacturers business lobbying group in Washington, calling it “a giant, beautiful, massive — the biggest ever in our country — tax cut.”
“The biggest winners will be everyday working families, as jobs start pouring into our country,” Trump said.
The U.S. national debt stands at about $20 trillion and the proposal provided few details on how to offset the federal revenues that would be lost with the tax cuts.
Trump has failed to secure passage of any major legislation since taking office in January, with a healthcare overhaul collapsing in the Senate, money to build his promised wall along the border with Mexico failing to materialize and infrastructure spending legislation never getting off the ground.
Pakistan conferred the Nishan-e-Pakistan, its top civilian award, on Chinese President Xi Jinping on Tuesday, lauding his "outstanding contribution in the promotion of the relationship between the two countries".
President Mamnoon Hussain conferred the award on 61-year-old Xi during a ceremony held at the President's House.
The ceremony was attended by Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, federal ministers, members of the National Assembly and Senate, the three service chief and the Chinese delegation.
The award was given for Xi's contribution in promoting China's relationship with Pakistan. Xi, also the General-Secretary of the ruling Communist party, was given a warm welcome on his arrival in the President's House in a traditional horse carriage.
He held bilateral talks with Hussain, who later hosted a luncheon in his honour. Xi, who is in Pakistan on his first state visit, unveiled a $46 billion corridor project.
The Nishan-e-Pakistan is Pakistan's highest civil award given by the government for the highest degree of service to the country. The award was established in March 1957.
Unlike other honours, it is a highly restricted and most prestigious award and is only conferred for meritorious and distinguished services to Pakistan, the international community and foreign relations. Nelson Mandela, Queen Elizabeth II, Morarji Desai and Dwight Eisenhower are among the recepients of the award.

Little-known GOP congressional aide to challenge Trump for presidency
A screengrab from a YouTube video of a speech Evan McMullin gave at Penn in Washington in May 2016. (Photo11: Screengrab, YouTube)
A former CIA officer and the chief policy director at the House Republican Conference jumped into the presidential race on Monday in an apparent protest to Donald Trump's candidacy.
"Like millions of Americans, I had hoped this year would bring us better nominees who, despite party differences, could offer compelling visions of a better future. Instead, we have been left with two candidates who are fundamentally unfit for the profound responsibilities they seek," Evan McMullin wrote in a letter on his campaign website. "With the stakes so high for our nation and at this late stage in the process, I can no longer stand on the sidelines. Our country needs leaders who are in it for the right reasons and who actually understand what makes this country the greatest on earth. Leaders who will unite us and guide us to a prosperous, secure future, beyond the dysfunction of a broken political system."
McMullin is little known even among Republicans in Washington. He has worked on Capitol Hill only since 2013, first on the House Foreign Affairs Committee then as policy director for the House Republican Conference. His boss there, Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers, R-Wash., has already endorsed Trump.
Evanmcmullin.com launched Monday morning and he had updated his Twitter profile to say he was running for president. "Former CIA operative, businessman, House Chief Policy Director. Standing up to run for president because it's never too late to do the right thing," the bio reads.
McMullin has been regularly posting anti-Trump commentary on his Twitter and Facebook accounts.
Authoritarians like @realDonaldTrump use promises of law & order to justify infringing on civil rights as they consolidate control by force. — Evan McMullin (@Evan_McMullin) July 22, 2016
Nate Hodson, a spokesman for the conference, said Monday, "The House Republican Conference has zero knowledge of his intentions."
McMullin apparently no longer works for the conference.
BuzzFeed News and MSNBC's Joe Scarborough first reported the bid.

Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption "We know division in Europe is dangerous and we must guard against it"
The Queen has spoken of the need for unity in Europe in a speech to German and UK leaders in Berlin.
The monarch, who is on a four-day trip, said "division in Europe is dangerous".
Her speech was made in the presence of German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Prime Minister David Cameron, who wants to reform the UK's EU membership.
Buckingham Palace stressed the comments were not about Mr Cameron's EU aims - but campaign group Republic criticised her "intervention in politics".
Ms Merkel and Mr Cameron earlier met for talks ahead of an EU summit in Brussels.
'Common endeavour'
The Queen, who as UK head of state stays politically neutral, told the banquet in Bellevue Palace, the official residence of Germany's president Joachim Gauck: "In our lives, we have seen the worst but also the best of our continent.
"We have witnessed how quickly things can change for the better.
"But we know that we must work hard to maintain the benefits of the post-war world.
"We know that division in Europe is dangerous and that we must guard against it in the west, as well as in the east, of our continent. That remains a common endeavour."
Analysis by Peter Hunt, BBC royal correspondent
Image copyright AP
Two heads of state - one elected, one hereditary - delivered two rather different speeches.
Germany's President Gauck had no difficulty echoing the position of his prime minister that they would assist Britain in order to keep her in Europe.
The Queen - who her aides insist is apolitical - wasn't there to actively and openly assist David Cameron in his bid to renegotiate the UK's EU membership.
Those around her say the British monarch's words were about Europe, not the EU.
She was able to draw on her personal wartime experience to highlight the advantages of unity and the perils of division.
There's no denying the content was pro-European; this was a British head of state highlighting the value of her country's place at the heart of the continent.
Such words won't harm if, when the time comes, David Cameron decides to back a Yes vote in the in/out EU referendum.
More from Peter Hunt
Later a Buckingham Palace aide said: "This is not about the EU. The Queen is apolitical. She would never make a political point."
However, Campaign group Republic claimed the Queen's comments fitted "a recent pattern of intervening and then having the palace deny it is an intervention".
Republic CEO Graham Smith said: "It's a dishonest and underhand pattern of interventions that is the result of the Queen being unaccountable for what she does."
He said she appeared to be "dancing to the PM's tune", but added: "If David Cameron thinks getting the Queen on side is going to help his cause he is playing with fire.
"An outspoken monarch is a much easier target for a growing republican campaign."
Robert Lacey, a historian and biographer of the Queen, said he thought it was clear the Queen's speech had been written "from her own experience" of living through World War Two and visiting the country 20 years after the war ended.
Image copyright PA Image caption The banquet was hosted by Germany's president Joachim Gauck
He said the first draft of the speech was likely to have been written by the Queen and her advisers and then run past government officials.
There was also a "huge Nato dimension" to her talk, he added, with the "east" she spoke of clearly referring to Ukraine.
The Palace aide said the Queen had been referring to risks of wider differences dividing the continent.
Mr Gauck said in his banquet speech that the EU needed the UK and it would support a "constructive dialogue" on the reforms Mr Cameron wanted.
He said the EU was facing "major challenges" and that "an effective European Union" was "based on a stable foundation of shared values".
"A constructive dialogue on the reforms Britain wants to see is therefore essential," he said.
"As a good partner, Germany will support this dialogue. For Britain is part of Europe. The European Union needs Britain.
"A united Europe, a strong European Union, represent stability, peace and freedom - for us all."
Mr Cameron has said he wants to reform the UK's membership of the EU before holding an in/out referendum in 2017.

In a recent article for Foreign Affairs, the political scientist John Mueller wrote that we should not care about Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's reported use of chemical weapons. His case hinges on the argument that Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein's unleashing of massive amounts of mustard gas and nerve agents on unprotected civilians during the Iran-Iraq War in the 1980s had few consequences. Yet there is ample evidence that the weapons had severe immediate and long-term effects on those exposed to them. And the international community's indifference to Saddam's use of the poisons led the Iraqi regime to increasingly rely on them. In turn, Iraq's unchecked chemical weapons program gave Iran the impetus to pursue a chemical weapons program of its own.
There is an international norm against the use of such inhuman weapons for a reason: they are profoundly devastating. As the Syrian conflict intensifies, chemical weapons could make the civil war more violent and destabilizing. And simply turning a blind eye to Assad's testing of American red lines will only complicate the endgame in Syria.
MARTYR CITY
On March 16, 1988, Saddam launched a devastating chemical attack on the Kurdish city of Halabja. Iran called for a UN investigation to determine the death toll, but Iraq denied inspectors access to the city. An authoritative study by Human Rights Watch lists various estimates of the casualties -- some are as low as 600, but most range between 3,500 and 6,000. A Red Cross official estimated that attacks between March 16 and March 18 left some 5,000 civilian casualties, excluding Iranian soldiers. (Even today, gas trapped in basements continues to kill.)
Days after the strike, journalists from the BBC and other news agencies entered the town and documented “ghastly scenes of bodies strewn along Halabja's streets, families locked in an embrace of

Manhattan's ultra-luxury market may not be ultra-competitive these days — after all, how big is the pool of buyers who can afford $20 million, or even $10 million, on a home?
But the wealthy continue to flock to New York real estate, according to a Stribling report released Tuesday.
For the first time ever, the share of properties priced above $10 million was equal to the share of properties priced below $500,000 — with both at roughly 6 percent — an indication of how the market has been inflated by luxury listings, said Garrett Derderian, Stribling's director of data and reporting.
“As prices at the higher end have gone up, it's driven up prices as a whole,” he said.
Studios, however, spent the shortest amount of time on the market (along with one-bedrooms), with 56 percent entering contract within the first 59 days. The median price for studios sold in co-ops was $450,000; in condos, the median was $712,000 in the first quarter.
Homes priced above $10 million, on the other hand, are taking longer to sell, often lingering on the market for more than 180 days before entering contract.
Still, many are still selling, Derderian said.
New York is, after all, home to the most billionaires in the world, according to Forbes, which estimated that nearly 80 super-rich individuals have homes here, including two of the world's 10 wealthiest people: former mayor Michael Bloomberg and industrialist David Koch.
In all, nearly one-third of the total share of listings in Manhattan were priced above $3 million, which is well out of reach for average residents in the borough — where the median household income is roughly $66,700, according to Census figures.
Of the contracts signed in the first quarter of 2017, 17 percent were for homes priced above $3 million.
Despite the slowdown in the super-luxury market, contracts for condos above $20 million saw big price gains, year-over-year. The median price jumped 22 percent to $2.75, Stribling found.
Some experts are hopeful that tax reform, which is expected to result in cuts for the wealthy, will prop up the city's high-end market. That's why Mayor Bill de Blasio is calling on the state to support his “mansion tax" plan to levy a 2.5 percent surcharge on residential sales above $2 million.
The aim is to raise more than $330 million to fund rent subsidies for about 25,000 low-income senior citizens.
"The wealthiest among us have every reason to expect a major new tax break at the federal level given the proposal already put forward by President Trump and the Congress," de Blasio said in January. "We think in light of the fact that the wealthiest will be receiving a substantial federal tax break that it's time they pay their fair share in state and local taxes."
More recently, he noted that 432 Park Ave., the 96-story slender tower that's home to some of the world's wealthiest people, could have helped the city raise $30 million for affordable housing for 2,000 seniors based on the sale of 62 condos.
In a desperate effort to get GOP electors to switch their votes, wealthy filmmaker Michael Moore offered to pay whatever fines might be leveled against the electors by their states. But, Christine Rousselle noted at Townhall, that bribe is actually a felony.
“As pointed out by political comedian Tim Young, Moore's offer to pay the fine for voting for someone other than Trump is a violation of 52 USC 10307 (c), and is punishable with up to five years in prison and/or a $10,000 fine,” Rousselle said.
Just FYI: Moore's bribery offer is a felony punishable up to 5 years in prison and a $10,000 fine under 32 USC 10307 https://t.co/KntJEYo3C6 https://t.co/9ACtUWkV40 — Tim Young (@TimRunsHisMouth) December 19, 2016

Rousselle posted text of the actual law:
(c) False information in registering or voting; penalties
Whoever knowingly or willfully gives false information as to his name, address or period of residence in the voting district for the purpose of establishing his eligibility to register or vote, or conspires with another individual for the purpose of encouraging his false registration to vote or illegal voting, or pays or offers to pay or accepts payment either for registration to vote or for voting shall be fined not more than $10,000 or imprisoned not more than five years, or both: Provided, however, That this provision shall be applicable only to general, special, or primary elections held solely or in part for the purpose of selecting or electing any candidate for the office of President, Vice President, presidential elector, Member of the United States Senate, Member of the United States House of Representatives, Delegate from the District of Columbia, Guam, or the Virgin Islands, or Resident Commissioner of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.
Nobody, she added, stepped forward to accept Moore's bribe, but as Bobby Gerry observed earlier today, more electors turned on Hillary than Trump.
Of course, the current regime won't do anything, but we'd like to hear from you. Should the incoming administration file felony charges against Moore and throw him in jail?

During our many write ups we do love writing about old retro games that people have never heard of, or those that have been lost through the years and for one reason or another have been uncovered, much to the amazement of the community. Today's release for example is a double bonanza, as thanks to The Spanish site El Trastero del Spectrum, they have uncovered a number of ZX Spectrum games that were thought to be lost, 'Excalibur' and 'Taxi Driver'.Two of the games including an educational piece of software, were by a publisher called QIS. One which was considered lost, and another was presented only as a Z80-Image. The first game Excalibur is a first person sword attack and defence game in which you need to defend yourself against a number of knights that have been bewitched by Morgan, which is based on the legends of King Arthur. The game according to idpixel.ru has good graphics, smooth animation and looks to have been made in BASIC.The last game to be mentioned is a game called Taxi Driver, and puts you in control of your very own Taxi in a top-down view point and must drive passengers from place to earn lots of money. If you crash a lot, and are a bit of a bad driver or run out of fuel, you can lose some of the money earned. To win the game you need to earn at least 60 000 pesetas. Also according to idpixel.ru, the game was written in pure assembler and the game is smooth throughout.: 1) Source News (RU) 2) Main Game Site

Last week, we told you what actually goes on at a Food52 photoshoot—and this week, we'll give you a similar recap, but one that's not quite as neatly organized.
How else to fully reflect the nature of our slightly-chaotic, always fun shoot days (and because not every photoshoot has nugget-y takeaways)?
So here's our day, unabridged and unashamed, from start to finish, beginning with toast ending with... a whole roasted fish?
Good mooooorning and welcome to our "office," where Ali, who doubles as Book Editor (can't you tell from that stack o' galleys by her feet?) is armed with a mug of coffee—and some wine?
Tuesday mornings make us SMILE! (In anticipation of the cream pie to come.)
A closer look at our "desk" (ignore my feet):
Lucky Peach, Breads Bakery, and Turkish breakfast (in a bowl and a mug). Date syrup, too.
Just a small selection of flowers to choose from (many of which were selected by our Art Director Alexis):
Burnt-ish toast for "breakfast." This melty pat of butter doesn't just happen—we torched it! (Note the supernaturally bubbling butter two photos below):
Take a wild guess as to why we shot this photo:
Hints: headphones; an iPhone (tuned into a certain podcast, perhaps?).
The beginning of cream pie, before we smoothed out the pudding (and before we piled on a whipped cream hat!):
Pudding plops aplenty. Stay tuned for the GIF!
The end of cream pie, the real version:
Best seat in the house!

It turned out to be the work of one man, Nicholas Principe and it was so beguilingly beautiful that it attracted the attention of Brian Eno - someone who knows a thing or two about making minimal music which can tug on the heartstrings.
Upon hearing Principe's falsetto you couldn't help but think of The Antlers, and so it came as no surprise to learn that Pete Silberman was a childhood friend, and sometime collaborator, of the Port St. Willow man. Yet the music of Holiday was no lifeless carbon copy of Silberman's band; build around understated rhythms, ambient patterns and textures, and threaded together by Principe's heavenly voice Holiday was intended to be a "one-piece" listen: no single entry points, no easing yourself in. You had to give yourself wholly to the record, but it was completely worth it.
Port St. Willow return this week with new album Syncope, released through Principe's own label People Teeth. Once again it's intended to be listened to as a whole piece, pausing only to turn the vinyl to side B should this stream send you running to the record stores to buy a physical copy. And it really should. It's once again a stunning and moving piece of work which features Silberman - and Will Epstein of High Water - on lead track "Ordinary Pleasure", and there's a focus on improvisation which gives Syncope an intimate, live feel.
Listen to Syncope - exclusively here on Best Fit as one flowing piece of music - below.
Syncope is out 20th November on People Teeth.
Redskins receiver Niles Paul has an immense love for Capri Sun drinks, and made a habit of bringing them to practice during training camp. But he had a problem. Paul's teammates would snag pouches of his favorite drink when he wasn't looking. A cold-blooded, thirst-fueled crime.
Someone at Capri Sun heard about Paul's troubles, and sent him a new case of drink pouches, accompanied by an elegant solution to his problem. More from Sarah Kogod of D.C. Sports Bog:
The company had removed the straws from every container in the case, rendering them undrinkable to the average drinker. In their place, they provided Paul with a silver straw of his own, complete with his name and number engraved on it. The straw came in its own padded case.
The straw removal was so simple yet so effective. The thirsty teammates were thwarted, and Paul can enjoy his Strawberry Kiwi Capri Suns in peace.

October is LGBT History Month. To honor transgender people and their unique histories, I will be featuring transgender people and parents of transgender children all month long. Through sharing their stories, I hope to raise awareness of this amazing population of people who still struggle for basic human rights.
By Jenny Shields Cowgill, parent of a transgender child
Having a trans kid has transformed my life in a number of ways. There have been times when I felt it was tearing our lives apart, when I thought everything would be so much easier if my kid could just be cisgender. Not because we couldn't accept him, but because he couldn't accept himself. There were days when I wasn't sure he'd make it or ever have a normal, happy or fulfilling life. There were days when I absolutely couldn't stand him and days where all I wanted to do was hold onto him to keep him from falling apart. Most of the time I doubt if I'm up for it. If I'm adequate enough to handle all the difficulties that come with raising a trans kid. I lack patience and focus. My fuse is short. I lack skills. It's definitely been the hardest thing I've ever gone through as a parent. As a person. It's been exhausting and created a lot of strife in our lives. And it's also made me braver, bolder, and better. It's made me stronger. My kid has given me the courage to do things I never dreamed I was capable of. More than anyone I've ever know in my life, he's had the greatest impact on me.
He came out as a lesbian at 11, and then trans at twelve. I'd been going to PFLAG and took him to a meeting where a trans guy was the speaker. That was it. He saw himself. He hadn't been able to understand it or articulate it before, but now he knew. There was depression, cutting, anxiety. Lots of therapy sessions. There was homeschooling, and then a new school, and then homeschooling again. Getting him an education was the greatest source of strife and stress. Nothing was working. Our marriage suffered. My youngest child would always get the shaft. I felt like a terrible wife. A neglectful mother. I felt all wrong. Everything was wrong. Then there was the hospital stay. This was the game changer. This is what got us over the hump. This created the impetus to get a legal name change, to seek hormone therapy. Which was absolutely terrifying. Sitting in that office, reading that list of all the side effects, knowing my child would become sterile, would be at higher risk for diseases, would never be able to reverse some of the effects of testosterone was absolutely crushing. All I could do was cry, even when all I wanted to do was be strong for my kid who just wanted to be himself. But eventually things got better.
There is nothing quite like having a trans kid to make you search deep into your soul, to examine who you really are, to make you come face to face with your authentic self. While all of this was going on, and even when Ray and I were at odds, when we were fighting, when he hated me, we shared something significant. Our queerness. It was something I'd suppressed in myself. I pushed it down and buried it for so many years, and I never would have come to terms with it without my son. We talked a lot about queer issues, as my kid identifies as super gay. I became a big supporter of equal rights, and am a bit of an activist. I was so much more connected to the LGBTQ community. Seeing Ray come to terms with his trans and gay issues gave me the courage to come to terms with my own bisexuality. It was a slow process. I was filled with doubt and guilt and fear. At first I only talked with my kid about it. As a savvy teen, he knows ALL about queer issues. And he was very accepting and supportive. I eventually came out to others, and while it hasn't changed my outward life, it has had an impact internally. What a burden to free myself of. Knowing and accepting who I was has brought such clarity to my life.
But that wasn't the only significant impact. We live in a pretty conservative environment. It's a small town, and there isn't a lot of diversity. The large city close by is not very progressive. Finding other kids like my son meant going an hour away to various cities. There was nothing here for him, and he often felt lonely and isolated. I wished we had something for LGBTQ youth here. I wished someone had put together a youth group like some of the other ones that were in other cities. And then I realized I was someone. It was a thing that was needed that didn't exist. And so I started one. I reached out to my friends in PFLAG, GLAD, Equality Illinois, leaders of queer youth groups in other cities. We connected with the pride groups from the community college and the university. Someone connected me with a retired pastor in the area who is a supporter of LGBTQ rights. Together we started our youth group. We got a focus group together and fashioned it after the other queer youth groups that my son had attended in other cities. It started small, only five, but eventually got bigger. There are no GSAs here so none of the kids in the large main city and surrounding smaller schools had any resources or support. More came. We started it at once a month, but soon realized they needed it more frequently and went to twice a month. One kid with an unaccepting parent and school environment said it wasn't just a fun time where he felt safe to be himself, but it was something that got him through the weeks. Knowing he had a supportive place to go kept him going. And so we are now going weekly. Our one year anniversary is this month. We have gone from five kids to close to thirty. These kids come filled with fear and anxiety, with social issues. Some come from unaccepting families. And then they realize they are home. When they are at group they are loved and accepted. They are free to be themselves. They are safe. It's made a real impact on so many young lives. We are also planning a parent group as so many here know little about LGBTQ issues and need support. None of this would have happened without my kid. And it's not just that I wouldn't have created it without his own need for something like it. Advocating for my trans son has made me more confident to go out in the world and change it. To make an impact. To take action. In my own life and in my community. So having a trans son has not only transformed my life. It goes beyond that. It has touched the lives of so many others. While our slice of the world might be small, his impact has made a huge positive difference.
Ray has changed a lot. Once isolated and filled with anxiety and fear, he is more confident and happy. He's made many new friends and he's quite social. He feels so much more comfortable in his own skin. While his journey is just beginning, we now see a bright future for him, and he can see it too. My hope is that other kids like him, kids who find us and come to group, can see that brighter future for themselves. Without Ray, they may have never had that opportunity.

If you've been following my coverage of E-Nable, a volunteer organization dedicated to 3D-printing prosthetic hands for kids, you'll be familiar with Aaron Brown's work. He makes “superhero” hands in multiple colors and recently completed this fun Wolverine model for a young man born without fingers. The hand includes removable “blades” and is blue and yellow, just like the early X-Men costumes.
Brown recently opened a 3D print shop in his hometown of Grand Rapids, Mich. and has begun working with Marvel to deliver his hands alongside Marvel Universe LIVE! I contacted Brown to ask him about his new shop and what he's been doing to help kids with his 3D printer.
TC: Hey, Aaron. What have you been up to?
Brown: Lots. I just opened the first, and only, public 3D Print shop in Grand Rapids, Michigan. AxisLab 3D.
I'm specializing in classes, material sales, and of course 3D printing and prototyping services. It's a scary and exciting venture, starting a small business that is, especially one involving a technology that so many people don't even know exist, but I am passionate and truly love what I do.
TC: Tell me about your work with E-Nable.
B: I have been a highly active and passionate member of E-Nable since nearly the beginning, close to 2 years. Most notably I have been known for some of the themes I add to the hands. I started doing “Superhero hands” early on, with my Wolverine hand that received worldwide attention. I have done dozens of other superhero themed hands since, and have inspired countless other designers and volunteers to take on themes and accessories for 3D printed prosthetics. It's so great to see such amazing creativity coming out of a group that is nothing but volunteers, working tirelessly from the goodness of their hearts. It leaves me in awe sometimes, and I am truly blessed to be part of such an amazing group of people.
[gallery ids="1168772,1168773,1168774"]
TC: Has anything memorable happened?
B: Things really started picking up for me when the Marvel Universe LIVE! group saw what we were doing, and flew a handful of our top e-Nable Builders to Dallas, myself included, for a superhero build event for kids. We were joined by some of the Marvel Universe LIVE! cast themselves to assemble hands for some superhero kids.
The Marvel Universe LIVE! group has now been touring the country and changing kids lives with the help of e-NABLE and 3D Printing on a regular basis.
TC: What's next?
B: The future of 3D printed prosthetics is an exciting thing to think about. Things are improving, and changing on a daily basis, you never know what to expect.
As of today e-NABLE is officially & legally a 501(c)3 Non-Profit!! And on top of that, just last week was awarded a $600,000 grant from Google.
This opens the doors to so much potential, it's incredible. We have teams working on low profile exoskeleton systems for children with limited mobility, groups working on sensor controlled robotics, technology teams focusing on scanning and measurement applications, web and mobile apps, the list truly goes on and on.
I am so proud to be a part of all this, and as long as I have my printers and my store, there is never an excuse to not have them running for such a great cause.
African Americans Visiting, Moving To Ghana In Record Numbers
301 SHARES Share Tweet Share Email
Africa evokes images of vibrancy and growth instead of poverty, war and struggle, Ezinne Ukoha reports in a story in The Grio.
In this context, Ghana is fast becoming a mecca for black Americans who are looking for lucrative opportunities in a new environment. About 10,000 African Americans visit Ghana yearly, according to recent reports. Almost 3,000 African Americans live in the capital, Accra, the major hub of Ghana.
Signs of a growing trend
While these numbers are not huge, they are still significant. Almost six years ago there were just 1,000 African-American expatriates living in Ghana.
What has attracted them? This burgeoning nation has consistently enjoyed a peaceful political climate without many threats of internal or external strife since it gained its independence from the British back in 1957, The Grio reports. The temperate weather also makes it an attractive choice.
But most importantly, there are elements that could resonate with anyone seeking a more laid-back lifestyle. The country offers pristine beaches, affordable living and a sense of spiritual calm permeates the landscape, making Ghana an attractive alternative to the proverbial American “rat race,” Ukoha said.
Ghana is living up to that hype, in addition to being a land of economic opportunity and bountiful resources.
Why relocate to Ghana?
Most Americans are starting to grasp the notion that they may have better luck financially in another country. As the American economy continues to falter, some blacks are finding that places new and unfamiliar could challenge them in ways leading to upward mobility.
Monies saved and invested elsewhere can yield bigger dividends. The educational attainment of many African-Americans can be put to immediate use in countries that have not been able to offer their populations similar luxuries until recently.
Much has been written about American blacks moving to South Africa for these very reasons, but I would like to suggest Ghana be added to the short list of locales for those considering planting new roots in the Motherland.
Technology, teaching and more opportunities
There are a plethora of companies in Ghana eager to recruit foreign applicants. If you are lucky enough to be well versed in all things digital, securing employment with a well-established technology firm is a strong possibility. Organizations such as Blogging Ghana have created platforms for interactivity within the social media realm that are reaching a global audience. Employees of such firms will have the opportunity to be proponents for change in an emerging field.

Or you can more easily start a family business. More than half of the African-Americans that reside in Accra are entrepreneurs. Local chiefs are often more than willing to grant prized land and other resources to budding entrepreneurs interested in real estate development, or other commercial ventures. This could also lead to a lucrative life in farming – or “agribusiness” – for those interested in a totally new, yet viable way of making a living.
Teaching is another highly desirable profession. English is the official language of Ghana; thus, entering academia as a teacher of the language could be one means of entrance into a coveted class. Plus, there are many supports extended to foreign pupils and the qualified staff who instruct them. You and your family could benefit from this aspect of the economy as native speakers.

Submissions have been made to transform an enlarged Galway City into a three-seat constituency of its own – with a decision to be made during the course of 2017.
A commission has been appointed to review all of the constituency boundaries and submissions in this regard are being invited from the public.
There are already two submissions suggesting that Galway City have its own constituency rather than being part of a five-seater Galway West which also includes a chunk of Mayo.
If this were to happen then the Galway City constituency would have to include the likes of Oranmore and Claregalway, and possibly Barna, to give it the sufficient population to make it a three-seater.
As it stands the population per TD is 30,000 and as Galway City has a population of just under 80,000, a further 10,000 would be required to make it into a three-seat constituency.
It would mean that the remainder of the county including Connemara and Galway East would then be combined into a five-seater.
According to one of the submissions it is now time to “correct” the constituency of Galway West and South Mayo into both an urban and rural constituency. It states that Galway requires its own constituency for the city and its urban citizens.
It makes the argument that Limerick City, with a significantly smaller population than Galway City, has its own urban constituency. It is stated that Galway West has two distinct urban and rural populations.
In another submission, it is stated: Galway has a combined population of over a quarter of a million people and Galway West is lumped in some confused boundary with Mayo.
“It makes no sense that we don't have a city boundary with city politicians looking after it”, the submission adds. The public have until January 10 to make further submissions.
There is also a submission to the new commission to restore the Mayo boundary and remove that part of the south of the county from the Galway West constituency.
Edit: Just looking for what cards I will be able to keep in the deck before I upgrade
Summary: What general changes should I make to my deck to create a better version of either artifact Sharuum or flicker sharuum? How can I make these changes for 30$ or so?
Hello,This is my first attempt an an EDH deck since I took a break for a while. I tried to make a deck to flicker ETB creatures but don't have many cards to do this, so I ended up adding a lot of artifacts to sacrifice things and artifact creatures. If anyone can help give feedback that would be great. I don't really have any tutors and I only have about 3 flicker spells. I'm hoping to aim for a sharuum flicker deck, but don't know what I should add or take away to get there. All feedback is welcome!
Thank you for your time,millmatter
Family Research Council President Tony Perkins and Ted Olson, one of the most high-profile conservative advocates for gay marriage, battled over the issue Sunday morning on Fox News Sunday.
Perkins argued that SCOTUS' non-decision on a slew of gay marriage appeals last week, which effectively legalized the practice in a number of states, was a “back alley Roe v. Wade“* move that would politicize the debate and “have ramifications for years to come in this nation.”
Olson, a former solicitor general for the Bush administration, scoffed at this, drawing the parallel to Loving v. Virginia, which declared bans on interracial marriage unconstitutional.
Perkins denied this connection. “We're talking about an arbitrary boundary created by man between the races; that doesn't exist in nature,” he said. “There is a boundary between people of the same sex getting married. They can't procreate. There's nothing in nature to say that's normal.”
Perkins argued that marriage was not for the legal protection of an adult union but for the protection of children. Olsen threw that back in his face. “What the Supreme Court said in the cases that it decided last year involving the defense of marriage case, striking that down, is that children do matter,” Olsen argued. “There are thousands and tens of thousands of children in same-sex households. They deserve the same respect and decency to that others have.”
There's more, including bits about judicial activism, wedding bakeries, and so forth. Watch the clip below, via Fox News:

Occupy Wall Street protesters continue to show restraint in the face of what some are calling a police riot. The violence is coming mostly from police supervisors, probably carrying out the will of Bloomberg's corporate cronies, and mostly not from the rank and file police. Some demonstrators are performing acts of civil disobedience, intending to be arrested as a demonstration of their commitment. But even those have been completely non violent. Every time police supervisors are caught on tape carrying out the savage agenda of corporate criminals, the popularity and credibility of the demonstrators increase. I commend their restraint. Here's an overview.
Just before 8 p.m. Wednesday, reportedly at the corner of Broadway and Wall Street, a New York Police Department officer appeared to turn on a throng of activists with the Occupy Wall Street movement, hitting them with a baton. A video posted hours later to YouTube shows the officer wielding the baton with two hands — like a baseball bat — as he swings at and strikes the demonstrators. At one point, a woman can be heard shrieking in the background. The white-shirt cop, most likely a supervisor, had stood next to at least a half-dozen other officers, including other department brass. The video shows the officer appearing to nudge a spectator out of the way, back up and raise his baton. He then gets off three swings before the crowd appears to surge toward him — digital cameras and video recorders held high. This may be the first of many videos documenting clashes between the police and Occupy Wall Street. At the end of the video a few in the crowd chant: "The whole world is watching! The whole world is watching!" It is unclear from the video what provoked the officer's actions, but HuffPost's Matt Sledge, who was at the scene, reports the baton swinging took place after a handful of people had been arrested for attempting to cross a police barricade. When reached for comment Friday night, a New York Police Department spokesman who refused to be identified said he had heard about the video but had not seen it and therefore could not comment… [emphasis added]

In the scores of demonstrations, in which I participated during the 1960s, the only time I witnessed such a savage attack by police was Chicago, 1968 at the Democratic Convention.
Keith Olbermann reported on the “police riot” in two segments on Countdown.
In the second, he also interviews Ryan Devereaux, who was there.
A concubine is a female who voluntarily enslaves and sells herself to a man primarily for his sexual pleasure. Concubines in the patriarchal age and beyond did not have equal status with a wife. A concubine could not marry her master because of her slave status, although, for her, the relationship was exclusive and ongoing. Sometimes concubines were used to bear children for men whose wives were barren. Concubines in Israel possessed many of the same rights as legitimate wives, without the same respect.Although it's true the Bible nowhere explicitly condemns concubinage, a condemnation can be foundfrom the beginning of time. According to Genesis 2:21-24, God's original intent was for marriage to be between one man and one woman, and that has never changed (Genesis 1:27). As a matter of fact, a study of the lives of men like King David and King Solomon (who had 300 concubines; 1 Kings 11:3) reveals that many of their problems stemmed from polygamous relationships (2 Samuel 11:2-4).The Bible never explains why God allowed men to have concubines. He allowed divorce and polygamy, too, although neither was part of His original plan for marriage. Jesus said God allowed divorce because of the hardness of men's hearts (Matthew 19:8). We can assume the same hardness of heart led to polygamy and concubinage.We can also surmise a reason based on the culture of the day. Unmarried women in ancient times were completely dependent on their family members, such as their fathers, brothers, etc. If for some reason a woman had no family members or her husband had died or divorced her, she would be left with few options for survival. Most women in ancient times were uneducated and unskilled in a trade. Providing for themselves was very difficult, and they were vulnerable to those who would prey upon them. For many women in dire situations, becoming a concubine was a much more suitable option than prostitution, homelessness, or death. At least a concubine would be provided a home and afforded a certain amount of care.It appears God allowed the sin of concubinage, in part, to provide for women in need, although it was certainly not an ideal situation. Sin is never ideal. Christians should be reminded that, just because Goda sin for a time, it does not mean God is pleased with it. Many Bible narratives teach that God can take what some people mean for evil and use it for good (e.g., Genesis 50:20).
Según Whittle, "Rafael Hernando, portavoz del PP en el Congreso, explicó que ese cambio se tuvo que llevar a cabo dado que la información que RTVE estaba proporcionando era 'claramente en contra del Gobierno'". Para el IPI, el nuevo sistema de elección "sienta un precedente peligroso", entre otras cosas porque "los decretos ley que invalidan leyes ya existentes deberían ser usados solo en casos de urgencia, no para alterar un principio fundamental del buen gobierno de la corporación pública".

El PSOE se compromete a recuperar la anterior ley
Echa en falta un organismo independiente de supervisión
El Instituto Internacional de la Prensa (IPI por sus siglas en inglés) critica en su último informe el cambio legislativo que hizo en 2012 el Gobierno de Rajoy para elegir por mayoría simple al presidente de RTVE., explica Stephen Whittle, miembro de esta organización y ex director de Política Editorial en la BBC.El IPI –que es desde 1950 una institución formada por periodistas, editores y ejecutivos de la comunicación de 120 países dedicados a la protección de la libertad de prensa– ha recogido este y otros comentarios en un informe elaborado tras su visita a España el pasado diciembre para analizar cómo se ejerce aquí la libertad de información. Como conclusión de su experiencia, el IPI "remarca las", que "crecen a medida que el país se adentra en un año crítico por las elecciones".La delegación del IPI se reunió con la Comisión Mixta que supervisa a RTVE. "La derecha niega que haya un problema o que la libertad de expresión esté bajo amenaza; la izquierda ve los mismos hechos pero extrae la conclusión opuesta", sugiere el informe. En reuniones posteriores con los partidos,que regulaba el nombramiento del presidente de RTVE, y aseguró también que "recomendaría los candidatos usando un sistema de convocatoria pública con un proceso de selección llevado a cabo por una comisión independiente antes de proponerlos al Congreso"."Desde el PP no surgió ningún compromiso parecido", confiesa Stephen Whittle, aunque "estuvieron de acuerdo con queen el periodo anterior a las elecciones y compartir experiencias en la cobertura de campañas muy reñidas".El informe se refiere también a que el nuevo presidente de RTVE, José Antonio Sánchez, "ha alardeado de su afiliación al PP" . Y es más, le señala directamente como "supervisor" de un proceso "a través del cual conocidos simpatizantes del Gobierno han sido incoporados a la sala de prensa y en la elaboración de artículos clave". Precisamente por la deriva del enfoque informativo y los casos objetivos de manipulación , el IPI: "Un canal público debe dar ejemplo sobre los asuntos de los que informa, cómo y por qué", subraya el informe.La delegación del IPI se fue de España con la impresión de que es necesario crear un Consejo Estatal de Medios Audiovisuales para garantizar los derechos y obligaciones de las empresas de la comunicación. "Otros países europeos ven el valor de tener un organismo independiente (...) que puede trabajar con flexibilidad y rapidez; tener credibilidad y estabilidad ya que están aislados de las influencias políticas".Además, añade el informe, "digital en noviembre, justo un mes antes de las elecciones nacionales". Desde el IPI ven "inusual que eseas licencias sean concedidas directamente por el Gobierno en lugar de ser concedidas por un organismo regulador independiente" y advierten que "y que deje al Gobierno la posibilidad de premiar a los propietarios de los medios por su servicio político".
For $200 – or a bargain $700 for a family of four – visitors to a Florida zoo can swim in a pool with a terrified tiger cub.
If you think this sounds awfully cruel, you're not alone. More than 24,000 people have signed a petition asking the U.S. Department of Agriculture to end these swims.
According to People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, the tiger cubs at Dade City's Wild Things zoo are separated from their mothers soon after they're born. When they become too large to swim with visitors, many of them spend the rest of their lives in small cages with concrete floors.
The USDA is well aware of the mistreatment of animals at this zoo. In 2012, as reported by the Tampa Bay News, inspectors warned the operators to stop violating the Animal Welfare Act by “carelessly forcing tiger cubs to swim in a pool and pose for cameras.”
Inspectors had watched as a zoo employee “lowered a young tiger into a pool by the tiger's tail, pulled the tiger's tail in order to restrain it while it was in the pool, and pulled the young tiger out of the pool by the tiger's right front leg.”
The mishandling of the tiger cubs and other zoo animals resulted in “behavioral stress, physical harm or unnecessary discomfort,” the inspectors reported.
Wild Things ignored the USDA's warning, and for the past three years has continued to offer the tiger cub swims.
“It's not different than swimming with your toddler, or taking your little puppy in swimming,” the zoo's president, Randy Stearns, told FOX 13.
Really? If it's so harmless, then why did the USDA file a lawsuit against Wild Things last month, alleging the zoo operators did not show good faith in complying with the 2012 warning? The zoo “has continued to mishandle animals, particularly infant and juvenile tigers, exposing these animals and the public to injury, disease and harm,” the lawsuit states.
The zoo's director, Kathy Stearns, says these claims are false and blames PETA for pressuring the USDA into filing the lawsuit. (It was likely also the tens of thousands of compassionate people who complained directly to the USDA, as well as to the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission, via online petitions.)
Sterns told WFTS the tiger cub swims are actually “for the benefit of the animal.”
Yes, she really said that. “Have you been outside? It's hot,” she said. “You want to get in the pool. We want to get in the pool. So it's a really great time for the tiger to have fun.”
It's interesting that she failed to mention whether the tiger cub wants to get in the pool — which is probably why they often have to dragged in by their tails, as the USDA inspectors witnessed. Seems to me the swims are not for the “benefit of the animal,” but for the benefit of the humans pocketing hundreds of dollars each day by exploiting the animal.
“We pride ourselves on not being a regular old ZOO like the other places you have visited,” boasts the Wild Things website. “We have a variety of supervised Animal Encounters which allow you to interact with animals like no other ZOO allows.”
Perhaps no other ZOO allows Wild Things' up-close-and-personal interactions with tiger cubs, alligators, gibbons and other creatures because they're stressful for the animals.
In an effort to continue the tiger cub swims, Stearns told the Tampa Bay News that “on principle,” instead of paying a fine of up to $10,000 for the Animal Welfare Act violations, she is going to fight the USDA's lawsuit.
“I'm paying thousands of dollars just to put the USDA on trial,” she said.
And guess where those thousands of dollars are probably coming from? That's right, the wallets of tourists who, on principle (or lack thereof), see nothing wrong with forking over a couple hundred bucks to get to share a swimming pool with a stressed-out tiger cub.
“We haven't done anything wrong, so as far as we are concerned we are going to keep doing it until the Supreme Court or God comes down and says stop doing it,” Sterns told WFLA.
Or, hopefully, until she loses her case and the USDA shuts down Dade City's Wild Things – for the benefit of the animals.

Whoa: Senators Now Asking if Fusion GPS, the PR Firm Behind the Trump Pee-Party Oppo Dump, Is Itself an Agent of Russian Intelligence What? Sean Davis highlighted this part of Sean Davis highlighted this part of Senator Grassley's latest (futile) effort to get the FBI to report to Congress as the law demands. He requests... Also, more information has since come to the Committee's attention about the company overseeing the creation of the dossier, Fusion GPS. Namely, Fusion GPS is the subject of a complaint to the Justice Department, which alleges that the company violated the Foreign Agents Registration Act by working on behalf of Russian principals to undermine U.S. sanctions against Russians. That unregistered work was reportedly conducted with a former Russian intelligence operative, Mr. Rinat Akhmetshin, and appears to have been occurring simultaneous to Fusion GPS's work overseeing the creation of the dossier. I wrote to the Justice Department about this issue on March 31, copying you, and I have attached that letter here for your reference. The Justice Department has yet to respond. In addition to fully answering my March 6, 2017 letter, please also provide the following documents and information: 1. Documentation of all payments made to Mr. Steele, including for travel expenses, if any; the date of any such payments; the amount of such payments; the authorization for such payments. 2. When the FBI was in contact with Mr. Steele or otherwise relying on information in the dossier, was it aware that his employer, Fusion GPS, was allegedly simultaneously working as an unregistered agent for Russian interests? Please provide all related documents. 3. If so, when and how did FBI become aware of this information? Did it include this information about Fusion GPS's alleged work for Russian principals in any documents describing or relying on information from the dossier? If not, why not? 4. If the FBI was previously unaware of Fusion GPS's alleged unregistered activity on behalf of Russian interests and connections with a former Russian intelligence operative, does the FBI plan to amend any applications, reports, or other documents it has created that describe or rely on the information in the dossier to add this information? If so, please provide copies of all amended documents. If not, why not? Please provide all the requested documents and full answers to all the question by May 12, 2017. I hope that this matter can be resolved without additional holds on nominees. These are important issues that require public transparency. Here is a snippet from that previous letter he attaches to this new one, explaining how Fusion GPS came to be alleged to be in the service of Mother Russia: Here is a snippet from that previous letter he attaches to this new one, explaining how Fusion GPS came to be alleged to be in the service of Mother Russia: Over the past few years, the Committee has repeatedly contacted the Department of Justice to raise concerns about the Department�s lack of enforcement of the Foreign Agents Registration Act (�FARA�). I write regarding the Department's response to the alleged failure of pro-Russia lobbyists to register under FARA. In July of 2016, Mr. William Browder filed a formal FARA complaint with the Justice Department regarding Fusion GPS, Rinat Akhmetshin, and their associates. His complaint alleged that lobbyists working for Russian interests in a campaign to oppose the pending Global Magnitsky Act failed to register under FARA and the
Lobbying Disclosure Act of 1995. The Committee needs to understand what actions the Justice Department has taken in response to the information in Mr. Browder's complaint. The issue is of particular concern to the Committee given that when Fusion GPS reportedly was acting as an unregistered agent of Russian interests, it appears to have been simultaneously overseeing the creation of the unsubstantiated dossier of allegations of a conspiracy between the Trump campaign and the Russians. Mr. Browder is the CEO of Hermitage Capital Management (�Hermitage�), an investment firm that at one time was the largest foreign portfolio investor in Russia According to the Justice Department, in 2007, Russian government officials and members of organized crime engaged in corporate identity theft, stealing the corporate identities of three Hermitage companies and using them to fraudulently obtain $230 million. The $230 million was then extensively laundered into accounts outside of Russia. When Hermitage learned of the situation, its attorneys, including Mr. Sergei Magnitsky, investigated. In December of 2007, Hermitage filed criminal complaints with law enforcement agencies in Russia, complaints which identified the Russian government officials who had been involved. In response, the Russian government
� assigned the case to the very officials involved in the crime, who then arrested Mr. Magnitsky and kept him in pretrial detention for nearly a year, until he died under highly suspicious circumstances after being beaten by guards and denied medical treatment. In response to this, the US passed a "Global Magnitsky Act" imposing sanctions on Russia. Russia retalliated by forbidding US adoptions of Russian orphans.

And they did more than that, it is alleged, recruiting Fusion GPS to push Russian propaganda on Congressmen: And they did more than that, it is alleged, recruiting Fusion GPS to push Russian propaganda on Congressmen:
As detailed in press accounts and in Mr. Browder's FARA complaint, in response to hese actions, Prevezon Holdings and the Russian government began a lobbying campaign purportedly designed to try to: repeal the Magnitsky Act; remove the name "Magnitsky" from the Global Magnitsky Act and delay its progress; and cast doubt on the Justice Department's version of events regarding the corporate identity theft of Hermitage's companies, the fraudulently obtained $230 million, and the death of Mr. Magnitsky. Prevezon's lobbying efforts were reportedly commissioned by Mr. Katsyv, who
organized them through a Delaware non-profit he formed and through the law firm then representing Prevezon in the asset forfeiture case, Baker Hostetler. Among others, the efforts involved lobbyist Rinat Akhmetshin and Fusion GPS, a political research firm led by Glenn Simpson. According to press reports, Baker Hostetler partner Mark Cymrot briefed congressional staff on the asset forfeiture case, attempting to discredit the Justice Department's version of events and instead push the Russian government�s account. Rinat Akhmetshin, along with former Congressman Ron Dellums, reportedly lobbied the House Foreign Affairs Committee, telling staffers "they were lobbying on behalf of a Russian company called Prevezon and ask[ing] [the Committee] to delay the Global Magnitsky Act or at least remove Magnitsky from the name,� as well as telling the staffers "it was a shame that this bill has made it so Russian orphans cannot be adopted by Americans." Mr. Akhmetshin was also involved in the screening, targeting Congressional staffers and State Department officials, of an anti-Magnitsky propaganda film. For its part, Fusion GPS reportedly "dug up dirt" on Mr. Browder's property and finances, and attempted to generate negative stories about Mr. Browder and Hermitage in the
media, shopping stories to a number of reporters. All footnotes omitted, but you can view the original to see them.

We're prepared, ultimately if that is the outcome, to instruct state agencies to follow the law. That's consistent with what the governor has said in the past.
SALT LAKE CITY — The governor's office says the state will comply with the law if the U.S. Supreme Court doesn't stay a lower court ruling calling for recognition of same-sex marriages performed in Utah.
Utah would have to grant marital benefits to about 1,300 couples starting Monday unless the high court steps in.
"We're prepared, ultimately if that is the outcome, to instruct state agencies to follow the law. That's consistent with what the governor has said in the past," said Gov. Gary Herbert's spokesman, Marty Carpenter.
But, Carpenter added, Herbert believes the best course of action is for the Supreme Court to extend the stay until the question over same-sex marriage is settled.
The state sent an emergency request Wednesday to Justice Sonia Sotomayor, who oversees the six states, including Utah, in the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals. Attorneys for the couples who sued the state to have their marriages recognized filed a repsonse late Thursday. Sotomayor could issue an order Friday.
In the response, lawyer Joshua Block says there is no such thing as "interim marriage" as the state argued in its filing.
"In seeking to nullify marriages that were legal at the time they were solemnized, defendants seek to do something that is unprecedented in our nation's history," he wrote.
The 10th Circuit ruled last week that Utah failed to prove the need to stay a lower court decision forcing it to validate the marriages. A three-judge panel allowed a temporary stay to continue for 10 days so the state could appeal to the Supreme Court. That temporary stay expires Monday at 8 a.m.
Should the Supreme Court not extend the stay, the state Division of Motor Vehicles, the Utah Department of Health and other agencies could see a rush of couples looking to change names on drivers' licenses or to amend children's birth certificates. Courts also could see parents filing new adoption petitions.
"We do expect a sense of urgency from these couples. They'll want to seek benefits right away," said Deann Armes, Utah Pride Center spokeswoman.
Married same-sex couples say they and their families are in legal limbo regarding adoptions, child care and custody, medical decisions, employment and health benefits, future tax implications, inheritance, and many other property and fundamental rights associated with marriage.
"With the kind of uncertainty that they've been living with through this whole process, as soon as you have the ability to seek these privileges, they're not going to waste any time," Armes said.
Carpenter said the state doesn't intend to reprint various government forms until "we have an actual decision" and that there could be lag time in some areas.
"I don't know that it's as easy as flipping a switch," he said.
The governor's office told state agencies in January to put recognition of same-sex marriages performed in the state during the brief time it was legal on hold pending the state's appeal.
JoNell Evans and Stacia Ireland, Donald Johnson and Carl Fritz Shultz, Matthew Barraza and Tony Milner, and Elenor Heyborne and Marina Gomberg sued the state to have their marriages recognized. All were married in Utah between Dec. 20, 2013, and Jan. 6.
The marriage recognition case, Evans v. Utah, is separate from the original federal case, Kitchen v. Herbert, challenging the state's voter-approved gay marriage ban that defines marriage as between one man and one woman.
Utah contends a stay is called for because of the close connection between the two cases. Until the Kitchen case is resolved, requiring the state to recognize the marriages and provide marital benefits is premature and unwarranted, according to the state.
Utah argued the unions would be void if the same-sex marriage is found unconstitutional.
"How will the state and plaintiffs address the problems such a scenario would create?" Gene Schaerr, the state's lead attorney in same-sex marriage cases, wrote, adding neither should be subjected to that possibility.
Block argued that the marriages must be recognized whether Kitchen is ultimately affirmed or reversed.
"If any uncertainty exists, it is the product of defendants' unlawful attempt to put these marriages 'on hold' and continued attempts to seek emergency stays to avoid complying with federal and state court orders rejecting their legal arguments," he wrote.
MEXICO CITY -- Back in the 2003 Apertura, three Chilean forwards who were stealing the headlines in Liga MX were Sebastian "Chamagol" Gonzalez at Atlante, Luis Quinteros at Puebla, and Reinaldo Navia at Morelia. Gonzalez finished the season with six goals, Navia with 12 and Quinteros with nine. Before the 2003 Apertura, Gonzalez completed the 2003 Clausura with 16 goals and the 2002 Apertura with 13.
It's always been the case to see top Chilean footballers in Liga MX; there's a long list that includes the likes of Carlos Reinoso, who's regarded as one of Club America's biggest idols, or even Ivan "Bam-Bam" Zamorano, who came to Las Aguilas in 2001. Claudio "El Diablo" Nunez was a fan favorite for Tigres in the late 1990s and early 2000s, while Rodrigo "Pony" Ruiz left an important mark in Santos Laguna's history. The relationship between Mexican and Chilean football has persisted for many years, and now in the 2017 Apertura it's being expressed in maximum splendor.
Twenty Chilean footballers are currently playing in Liga MX, and the possibility of seeing that number increase is possible, considering that clubs can still bring in players from abroad. This weekend alone 12 of them appeared in their respective clubs' starting XIs.
There has been a trend since Mexico's catastrophic 7-0 defeat to Chile in the 2016 Copa America Centenario quarterfinal, and it's that in each season since that devastating defeat at least one important Chilean footballer has arrived to Liga MX. It started with Edson Puch in the 2016 Apertura, a season he went on to finish with nine goals for Necaxa. Then in the 2017 Clausura, Nicolas Castillo arrived to Pumas after finishing Chile's 2016 Torneo Apertura as the top goalscorer with 13 goals. In that same season, Eduardo Vargas made the move from Hoffenheim to Tigres. In his first season in Mexico, Castillo ended up scoring eight goals in ten starts for Pumas, while Vargas only scored once in eight starts and would go on to play zero minutes in the playoffs.
Chile's manager, Juan Antonio Pizzi, who coached Leon between 2014-2016, included six Liga MX-based players in his final Confederations Cup list. Pizzi, as Juanma Lillo, admires most of Liga MX clubs' offensive styles, but when ESPN FC asked him to elaborate on his point of view about the league in 2015, his response was cautious.
"Based on what we have been able to see in the year that we have been here, what he says is real [Lillo's idea that Liga MX is world's best]," he said. "But I think there is a margin of improvement in the defensive side of the game. Not only our team, but most of the teams can improve this side of the game. It's not just about seeing the goal in front us."
Nicolas Castillo arrived to Pumas and scored eight goals in 10 starts in his first season in Mexico in the 2017 Clausura..
For the new Apertura, Cruz Azul brought in forward Felipe Mora, who finished Chile's 2017 Torneo Clausura as the top goalscorer with 13 goals. Will he match the immediate impact shown by Puch and Castillo? It remains to be seen because with Martin Cauteruccio, Angel Mena, Martin Rodriguez, and Edgar Mendez, Mora will have to impress Paco Jemez in training sessions in order to get playing time.
Over at Pachuca, the arrival of Keisuke Honda takes a lot of attention away from the fact that the club opted to bring in a Chilean tandem that could ease the transition as the club begins a new chapter without Hirving "Chucky" Lozano. Puch and Angelo Sagal will be two important offensive assets at manager Diego Alonso's disposal. Liga MX knows what Puch can offer, but very few don't know what to expect from Sagal, who's coming from Huachipato. It was Sagal who took Castillo's place in the Confed Cup roster because the Pumas striker couldn't recover from an ankle injury.
After Pachuca presented its new additions, president Jesus Martinez noted to the press that Sagal had offers to play in midtable European sides but decided to come to Liga MX.
"I'm convinced that our league is between the eighth and 10th best in the world," Martinez said. "That's why he's [Honda's] here.
"That's why [Andre-Pierre] Gignac came. That's why [Angelo] Sagal, who had offers from midtable European clubs, preferred to come here than go there. Our league is at a phenomenal level, and that's great for Mexico."
With a year to go until the World Cup, where Chile will have a another opportunity to make history, a significant number of those who can see their name on Chile's final World Cup roster are playing in Mexico. Since Week 1, Castillo, Sagal, Vargas, and even Morelia's Diego Valdez gave impressive displays, as if knowing that each one of their moves will be closely observed by Pizzi and his coaching staff.
Liga MX has always been a great home for many Chilean footballers, and today, that's truer than ever.

There are new concerns over discarded needles after a child was reportedly poked by a syringe in a Port Coquitlam Park.
The child was a part of the Early Learning Childcare Centre, which operates next to Fox Street Park, where the incident happened on Wednesday.
READ MORE: Photo of pigeon's nest in bed of needles shows ‘sad reality' of Vancouver's opioid crisis
Laura Taylor's child attends the same daycare, and she said children are often taken to the park to play during the day.
On Wednesday, she said one of the kids was pricked by a needle in a gravel area, and was taken to hospital for a Hepatitis B shot.
LISTEN: Child pricked by discarded needled at Port Coquitlam Daycare
She said she's happy with the way the daycare handled the incident, and that all parents received a letter Wednesday evening telling them the youth is being watched closely and “seems to be doing OK.”
But the presence of used needles in the park has been a growing concern for Taylor, who said problems in the neighbourhood have escalated since a nearby RainCity transitional housing project opened in 2015.

“There have been multiple incidents where there are people who are passed out in the park, people who are being sexually inappropriate in the park when the kids go over,” she said.
“And this is in the middle of the day.”
WATCH: Calls for more ‘Needle Rangers' in Vancouver parks
Port Coquitlam Cllr. Glenn Pollock said the city already had the park on its radar.
“We've had city staff go there every morning and comb the park for needles, as well the RCMP go every morning to look for needles and also the staff from [the RainCity facility] go and have a look,” he said.
“I think what happened here was the fact that it was buried in the pea gravel was the issue.”
Dr. Ingrid Tyler with Fraser Health said that while it's always a concern when there is an incident of this type, it is uncommon to pick up an infection from a needle prick.
“It's important to note that while this can be very worrisome for the family and the community, the actual risk of infection following a needle stick injury is very very low and there have been no reported cases of HIV, Hep C or other diseases being transmitted in this way in the community.”
Catharine Hume, co-executive director with RainCity housing said that as a mother, she empathizes with the parents of the child who was pricked.
But she said it's not fair to pin the incident on her organization.
“I also want to be really clear that needles are in neighbourhoods throughout the Lower Mainland, throughout British Columbia. And the way that RainCity operates this shelter is very much about safety for the community as well as for safety for the people that we provide housing and supports to.”
To that end, Hume said RainCity conducts sweeps for needles and other drug paraphernalia twice per day in Fox Park, as well as sweeps throughout the neighbourhood.

Taylor said she has also been told that going forward, the city will be stepping up enforcement in the park and and that daycare workers will be raking the grass daily looking for any more drug paraphernalia.
“As it stands, one, I have to worry about the welfare of my kids,” she said.
“And, two, I am basically paying for childcare for these workers to go — and now they'll have to deeply rake through the park every day instead of somebody policing it — and not looking after my kids, because they have to do that first.”

Debate over how to address discarded needles has been growing in recent months, as the region grapples with an opioid addiction epidemic.
In January, the City of Vancouver closed a homeless warming shelter at the Creekside Community Centre after a child found a needle in the facility's washroom.
In March, a child in Maple Ridge was pricked with a discarded needle, while just last week a Kelowna six-year-old stepped on a needle which punctured their shoe.

Earlier this month, a pair of civic politicians with Vancouver's Non Partisan Association proposed hiring more park rangers to provide a 24 hour a day presence in the city's parks, partially to address the needle problem.

In June, Vancouver also stepped up safety patrols at Andy Livingston Park, which is adjacent to the Downtown Eastside and has been a hotspot for discarded needles.
In July alone, 902 used needles were collected in the Downtown Eastside, while 367 were picked up in Andy Livingston Park alone.
In a statement to Global News, the City of Vancouver said it “has received 1,445 reports of discarded needles across the entire city for the period of January to August of this year, a 68 per cent increase compared to the same period in 2016 when 860 reports were made.”
People who find used needles can contact Vancouver Coastal Health's needle-pickup hotline at 604-657-6561, or one of Fraser Health's public health units.

The political action committee of Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe, a Democrat and longtime ally of the Clinton family, donated nearly $500,000 to the state Senate campaign of the wife of an FBI official who helped oversee the investigation into Hillary Clinton's private email server.
McAuliffe's political organization gave $467,500 to Dr. Jill McCabe's 2015 state Senate campaign in Virginia, the Wall Street Journal reported. McCabe's husband, Andrew McCabe, works for the FBI and was one of the top figures responsible for overseeing the probe into Clinton's email practices while she served as secretary of state.
McAuliffe, a longtime friend and adviser to the Clintons, encouraged McCabe to run for the state Senate seat and helped direct funds to her campaign totaling $675,000, according to the Journal.
The Virginia Democratic Party, over which Mr. McAuliffe exerts considerable control, donated an additional $207,788 worth of support to Dr. McCabe's campaign in the form of mailers, according to the records. That adds up to slightly more than $675,000 to her candidacy from entities either directly under Mr. McAuliffe's control or strongly influenced by him. The figure represents more than a third of all the campaign funds Dr. McCabe raised in the effort.
McCabe's husband was running the FBI's Washington, D.C. field office in July 2015, when the federal investigation into Clinton's email practices was launched. His office provided assistance to the email probe when his wife announced her candidacy for the state Senate seat. He was soon promoted to the FBI's headquarters, and became FBI Director James Comey's second-in-command in February 2016, the Journal noted.
As deputy director, Mr. McCabe was part of the executive leadership team overseeing the Clinton email investigation, though FBI officials say any final decisions on that probe were made by Mr. Comey, who served as a high-ranking Justice Department official in the administration of George W. Bush.
McAuliffe served as President Bill Clinton's chief fundraiser in the 1990s and remains close to the former first couple. He currently is under investigation by the FBI for alleged improper donations on behalf of a Chinese businessman.
A spokesperson for the governor's office denied any wrongdoing or improper relationship between the political donations to McCabe and McAuliffe's friendship with the Clintons.
The Congressional Black Caucus is demanding that Attorney General Loretta Lynch immediately take action to prevent police killings with a nationwide crackdown on law enforcement.
"The world is watching and we cannot continue to ignore these killings," said Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif., presenting the letter to the media Thursday while the entire caucus stood in support outside the Department of Justice.
The Congressional Black Caucus' letter urges Lynch to "aggressively pursue investigations, indictments and prosecutions through the Office of Civil Rights against any and all law enforcement officers who harm or kill innocent unarmed black men, women and children.
"No American should have to fear the people sworn to protect them," said Congressional Black Caucus PAC chair Rep. Gregory Meeks, D-N.Y. Meeks said that despite the violence, civil rights icon Martin Luther King would have similarly called for action in the face of alleged racial profiling by police.
"Dr. King's soul and essence is in every peaceful demonstrator that is on the streets because Dr. King would be demonstrating today when you see the kind of attack that apparently happens to unarmed black men and women with no transparency."
The lawmaker said they will call upon House Speaker Paul Ryan to come up with some legislation to address policing nationally, but said the caucus decided to take immediate action by petitioning the attorney general.
Rep. Alma Adams, D-N.C., whose district includes riot-ravaged Charlotte, said she is requesting on behalf of her constituents that Lynch use the full force of federal power to resolve the racially charged tensions between police and African-Americans. North Carolina's Republican Gov. Pat McCrory declared a state of emergency in the city after the protests turned violent.
"We've had a lot of violence in our community and I am saddened about that because people should have an opportunity to protest and to protest peacefully. And that's what many of the residents were trying to do last night," Adams said. "The National Guard has been called into Charlotte and we regret that. I don't think this should have gotten so far."
"We are serious about what we do, we will not be deterred from our actions," said Congressional Black Caucus chair Rep. G.K. Butterfield, D-N.C.
Tens of thousands of mumbaikars decided to brave the hours-long sweatfest in the scorching heat on May 10 at the DY Patil Stadium in Navi Mumbai, which typically seats 56,000 people. The arena was packed with hysterical teenagers and exhilarated adults alike. A who's who of Bollywood—Alia Bhatt, Sonali Bendre, Malaika Arora, Sridevi and others—were also in attendance.
The reason for the mania? Justin Bieber's first-ever live concert in India.
It's not every day that global celebrities like the 23-year-old Canadian singer perform in India. For instance, British rock band Coldplay's maiden India concert took place toward the end of last year, but worldwide sensations like Rihanna, Drake, and others haven't made it to the country yet. So, when Bieber announced his plans to bring his Purpose World Tour, India was stoked. (The tour commenced in Seattle in March and concludes in Tokyo this September.)
The organizers went all out, shelling out $4 million on arrangements, CNN reported. The gig marked the most expensive concert in India ever. Tickets began at around Rs5,000 ($77) but some of the most ardent (and affluent) Beliebers—what Beiber fans call themselves—dished out as much as Rs75,000 ($1,165) for a single ticket. An auto-rickshaw driver's son lucked out when organizer White Fox India awarded the priciest ticket to him at no cost.
Before arriving in India, Bieber's team reportedly delivered an extremely long list of demands. There were specific orders on his upholstery and room decor, dietary requirements, and the refrigerator and washing machine provided. The singer was also meant to get Z+ security—a special protection the government provides to just 36 influential people in the country.
But Bieber's India stop began as a stark contrast to what his team may have envisioned. He landed at the airport in a simple hoodie and shorts. Instead of special forces, Bollywood star Salman Khan's bodyguard Shera was seen escorting Bieber. Bieber had also called for a chopper but ended up journeying to the concert venue by road. In the hours leading up to his concert, he even walked into a Starbucks to grab coffee. The “Baby” singer also won hearts by paying a visit to underprivileged kids.
Everything was going smoothly until the concert began and the singer began crooning—well, technically, the problem was that he didn't croon.
Fans eagerly awaiting Bieber's biggest smash hits like “Where Are You Now,” ”Sorry,” “Boyfriend,” “Love Yourself” amid other popular tracks, were subject to a botched lip sync performance for most of the night. Worse, it seemed he didn't even try to make his act believable. Comedian Ashish Shakya from the popular comedy group All India Bakchod (AIB) described one such moment in a Facebook note, saying, “Bieber was wiping his face with a towel such that the towel covered his entire face, and the vocals just played on unchanged.” (Shakya's post in its entirety is a recommended read to get a sense of how little Bieber seemed to care about the pretense.) Another comedian from AIB, Rohan Joshi, jokingly called the event “Justin Bieber's Bombay Dubsmash.”
However, humor was not every downcast fan's crutch. Many lashed out on Twitter, criticizing Bieber's deadpan expression and ghar ke kapde (clothes worn at home). Fans who'd traveled from afar—from a different state even—were especially up in arms about the debacle.
“He performed the entire 90-minute set with the kind of enthusiasm you would expect from a robot, save for a couple of moments where he did seem to come alive and throw a magnanimous hello at the audience,” Rolling Stone India wrote.
Maybe the backlash got to the “Sorry” star: Beiber was supposed to stay and sightsee in Agra and Jaipur, take the standard tourist picture in front of the Taj Mahal, and partake in a handful of revelries. But reports suggest that he took off the night of the gig itself.
The performance wasn't the only buzzkill that night. According to Firstpost, a one-liter bottle of water was marked up nearly five times and was selling for Rs100($1.55). And thanks to the rules, after venturing outside, standing in long queues and buying the water, you weren't even allowed to take it inside. A Rs5 ($0.08) Vada Pav was selling for Rs95 ($1.48), Indiatimes reported. Standup comedian Atul Khatri also complained about the outrageously priced snacks:
But there's always a silver lining, right?
The players met with about 50 children at the Nevada Childhood Cancer Foundation and joined them for arts and crafts. The visit was part of Hockey Fights Cancer, a joint initiative between the NHL and the NHL Players' Association taking place throughout November.
"This was an event that you didn't have to ask anybody [to go to]," defenseman Nate Schmidt said. "A lot of guys wanted to come out today because it's a lot of fun. Anytime you can work with kids, it's a win-win."
Three rows of four tables were placed across the arts-and-crafts room, where the Golden Knights painting T-shirts with the kids. Some players, like Schmidt and defenseman Brad Hunt, slathered paint on their hands and created hand turkeys.
Though some Vegas players aren't natural artists, this was more about the purpose of being there rather than channeling their inner Picasso.
"You come here, and you see the smiles on their faces," Hunt said. "Some of them are going through difficult times, but you see the smile on their face and you realize how fortunate we are and how special we can make someone's day."
Rubi Vegas, 18, has been diagnosed with liver cancer twice, at age 6 and age 11. She said she is in remission, but that cancer took a toll on her family again recently when her mother died of the disease this past summer after being diagnosed in 2016.
The oldest of five sisters, Vegas said cancer forced her to mature quickly. That was heightened when she and her sisters had to take care of their mother.
"Having to see her sick was tough on all of us," Vegas said. "She was there through all my pain and my suffering, through treatment and all. So, I had to take her place and she had to take my place. It was a tough ride, but we're glad she's not suffering."
She said it meant a lot for the Golden Knights to visit the other children at the foundation, which provides programs and services to patients and their families.
"It's hard for them to walk around here and feel like they belong," Vegas said. "Just having that little moment of joy and happiness makes their day and reminds them to keep fighting."
Hot on the heals of our Verbal Expressions coverage comes Frak by Joel Holdbrooks.
Frak also generates regular expressions for you, but it does it in a completely different way. With Frak, you don't write an expression to match string patterns. Instead, you give it a set of strings and it generates an expression which matches them.
Frak is written in Clojure, so you install it by adding a dependency to your project.clj file:
[frak "0.1.2"]
To use it, simply require it, pass it a collection of strings, and it will return the resulting regular expression:
user> (require 'frak) nil user> (frak/pattern ["foo" "bar" "baz" "quux"]) #"(?:ba[rz]|foo|quux)" user> (frak/pattern ["Clojure" "Clojars" "ClojureScript"]) #"Cloj(?:ure(?:Script)?|ars)"

© Provided by Sportress of Blogitude Arizona State University has apologized to a Tempe, Ariz., councilman after the sideline antics of the Sun Devils mascot, Sparky, during last Friday's game ended with a trip to the hospital.
David Schapira had been on the mend for two months following back surgery, so when Sparky jumped on his back during last week's 34-10 win over the New Mexico Lobos, the councilman immediately knew something was not right.
“I kind of laughed at first, then my expression changes to terror as I felt that pop,” he said, via ABC-15.
The impromptu — and unexpected — piggyback ride caused a muscle tear. Schapira, already using a cane to get around, had to be carted off the field and taken to a hospital. His recovery from the original back surgery has been set back six weeks and he now needs a walker to get around. He later chronicled what transpired on Twitter.
Schapira, a current graduate student at the school, is a longtime Sun Devils fan and harbors no ill will toward Sparky for the injury.
“He was consoling me afterwards and I was kind of having to console him,” he said.
The university issued a statement apologizing for Sparky's actions.
“ASU sincerely apologizes for Sparky's excessive exuberance at Friday night's game. University officials have been in regular contact with Councilman Schapira since the incident and we have offered our fullest assistance and cooperation in getting his bills paid and we wish him a speedy recovery.”
As noted in the statement, the school will cover the medical expenses related to the mishap.
In the future, Schapira will make certain everyone is aware of his back condition should he once again hang out on the sidelines during the game.
“I'll wear a shirt saying ‘Be gentle' or ‘Fragile, handle with care,” he joked.
When I was a kid in second grade or so, I was obsessed with Davy Crockett. You know those old movies with Fess Parker and Buddy Ebsen, where they both end up at the Alamo doing Alamo stuff (SPOILER: mostly dying, in case you never took Texas History [I think Texas is literally the only state that makes students learn their history repeatedly. Maybe because we're the only state where enough happened to warrant teaching about it? Reason Number 1684568 Why Texas is the Best.])? Those movies were my thing. I remember reading everything I could get my hands on about Mr. Crockett. What. A. Man.
(This all has a point, I promise.)
So today, I'm be-bopping around town after watching a Baylor hype vid, and this song comes on. It's the Ballad of Davy Crockett! And then something crazy happens. As they're singing about Crockett's accomplishments, I realized that TGCAB also has done many of the same things, albeit in football, not with a rifle.
First, have a listen.
Now, on to the list.
9 Things That Prove Art Briles Is Basically Davy Crockett
1. Art Briles was born in a small town in West Texas. David Crockett was born in a small town in Greene County, Tennessee. (At the time, Tennessee was the closest thing America had to Texas, since Texas was barely being settled by LaSalle and the French in 1786.)
2. Both Briles and Crockett were early leaders. Briles led Rule High School to the Class B State Championship Game in 1973, while Crockett was made a Colonel in the Lawrence County militia.
3. Both men then took their outstanding leadership to bigger venues and were equally successful. Briles was a WR for U of H, taking the team to the Cotton Bowl in 1977. Crockett was elected to the Tennessee State Legislature in 1821, where he was influential in opposing Andrew Jackson's Indian Removal Act (think Trail of Tears).
4. Neither man enjoys showing his arms.

Come on, guys.
5. Both men suffered a tragic loss that led them to their destinies. For Briles, this was the fatal car accident that took his parents and aunt while they were driving to Dallas for the 1977 Cotton Bowl. For Crockett, it was not getting reelected to Congress in 1835.
6. Both men are darn good at what they do. Briles is tickled pink by the idea of a Baylor offense in the NFL, which shows that whatever magic he's cooked up here on the Brazos has impressed professional bigwigs. Crockett was a legendary shot and reportedly bought time for the few Texian defenders of the Alamo through their great marksmanship (otherwise that 13 day siege would have been much shorter).
7. Both men are larger than life. First, he is TGCAB. I'd say that's larger than life. Crockett was basically TGCAB but with marksmanship. Only with Disney movies instead of parody Twitter accounts.
8.Both men have signature hats.

(NOTE: This is Fess Parker portraying Davy Crockett. Just to clear that up real quick.)
9. Both men embody the best qualities of Texans: resilience, humour, and darn good fashion sense.
But,
I must account for that 1% difference.
Crockett: "You may all go to hell, and I will go to Texas."
Briles: "I'm not going to Texas."

The offices of Al Arabiya TV and Palestinian news agency Maan in the Gaza Strip have been temporarily shut down by Hamas, the AFP has reported.
“The Attorney General decided to close down Al Arabiya and Maan offices in Gaza for distributing false news regarding the smear campaign against Hamas and Gaza about what's happening in Egypt,” a Hamas official was quoted by AFP as saying.
A Maan employee and Hamas official told AFP that the Palestinian news agency's office was being
closed for investigating alleged Hamas ties with Egypt's Muslims Brotherhood.
On Thursday former Egyptian President Morsi was accused of having worked closely with Hamas during his Presidency.
Al Arabiya news organization chose not to reveal why its offices have been shut.
"“We received the closure notice and an official statement from Al Arabiya will be published to respond to this decision,” its Gaza correspondent, Islam Abd Al Kareem, told the AFP.
This is the (admittedly very delayed) continuation of my previous Conjure Oils review, which is found here. Today I'll review Maman Brigitte, March – Storm Moon, Marie LaVeau, Set, and Shapeshifter.
Maman Brigitte
Tobacco, peppered rum, spicy clove, piquant cinnamon and graveyard dirt
In the vial this is honeyed pecan and rum with a bit of spice. After a few minutes on my skin, it develops a clear but gentle cinnamon note (unless, as I did on a later wear, you dump 1/4 of the vial on yourself by accident, in which case the cinnamon is not gentle). It's like spiced pecan cookies or, a bit later, kind of like snickerdoodles, but nuttier. With a bit of rum in the batter. It's not terribly sweet despite that.
By an hour, there's a lot of sweet cinnamon and rum, almost like a boozy cinnamon roll. I still get a bit of that pecan scent, but it verges on dry tobacco now. Overall warm, sweet-spicy, strangely sexy. By 3 hours it's mostly sugared rum, cinnamon, and a bit of clove, with some indistinct but definitely present earthiness. Around 5 hours the rum leans a little sour, and I think it's the alcoholic bite of rum coming through, as opposed to most rum notes that I've tried which tend to be very sweet. It does the same thing in Marie LaVeau (see below).
Verdict: Really like this, other than the occasional sour edge. It's warm, boozy, spicy-sweet, and sexy – a very unisex kind of gourmand. If I had a boyfriend, I would give this to my boyfriend, and then probably steal it back later anyway. Sillage is a bit on the low side, but still some decent wafts. Longevity is good, not getting very weak until around 9-10 hrs.
Summary: Spiced cookies turn into a sweet spicy boozy earthy unisex gourmand.
March – Storm Moon
Tender dogwood blossoms, gentle daffodil and jonquil moistened with spring rain
In the vial and first on, it's a fresh floral, verging on soapy, with a touch of green grass. It's pleasant after a few minutes, a slightly sweet floral (I want to say daffodil?) and soft aquatic, giving a dewy impression, but it quickly starts smelling exactly like laundry detergent. I guess fairly nice laundry detergent, if you're into that?
It remains a very, very clean floral until around an hour, when it's a sweeter floral with a soapy, white musk edge. It becomes gradually less searingly soapy, and around 5 hours it's a pretty, light floral, fairly sweet. I don't know what dogwood and jonquil are supposed to smell like, but the floral here smells vaguely lilac-ish to me, or maybe hyacinth-ish.
Verdict: I hate soapy scents so unsurprisingly, not a fan. Someone who does like clean florals might really like this, but I honestly have no idea how to judge fresh clean scents like this, so I'll keep this short. Sillage is soft but not a skin scent until after 5 hours, and longevity (as a skin scent) is average.
Marie LaVeau
Sarsaparilla, French vanilla bourbon, a handmade lace shawl and a shot of rum for Papa Legba
In the vial, it's a creamy sarsaparilla scent, and develops an almost jasmine-like sweet cream scent on my skin before settling into pale vanilla, sweet sarsaparilla, and a bit of not-very-sweet rum. By 30 minutes it has a a pale, almost-floral linen element, from the lace shawl. It adds a clean edge, but not like soap or detergent.
It evolves slowly, a creamy sarsaparilla-spiced vanilla-y scent with a shot of non-sweet booze and a lingering clean edge, somewhat perfumey but definitely not conventional. Around 2 hours I get that slight sourness that I got from Maman Brigitte, on and off, but it doesn't ruin the otherwise nice balance of the cream, vanilla bourbon, and perfumey-clean lace shawl. By 5 hours, it's spiced rum-vanilla/boozy vanilla, but also kind of clean still. It ends a soft spicy rum skin scent around 10 hours.
Verdict: It's too clean for me to reach for often, but I kind of love that creamy sarsaparilla-vanilla/booze opening and the lace shawl note makes it very unique. It also wins the prize for the most feminine rum-heavy fragrance I've ever smelled, there's something quite elegant about it. Sillage starts strong, evens out to average after a few hours, and turns into a skin scent around 7-8. Good longevity, not fading completely until 12-ish.
Summary: Creamy, sarsaparilla-spiced vanilla, not-very-sweet rum, and a perfumey clean edge.
Set
Egyptian red amber, black patchouli, vanilla bean hull, sycamore, black musk, beeswax and vetiver
In the vial, I smell a lot of grassy-leaning vetivers and sweet resin. On my skin, it quickly turns very sweet with honey-dripping beeswax and amber taking over the sillage, but there's some earthiness hiding underneath, especially vetiver, but also something that smells like mineral-y dirt. After 30 minutes, the beeswax becomes more waxy than honeyed, with a rich but not-too-sweet amber and a very earthy dry wood and vetiver combination at its core. There's also a pronounced woody-nuttiness at deep sniff, like hazelnut – maybe the sycamore.
After an hour, there's a LOT of beeswax, followed by vetiver, rich amber, and woodiness. The patchouli gets stronger and stronger, and is very raw and earthy. Another hour and there's a dusty layer of black musk as well as a sweet high note, maybe the vanilla bean hull? After 4 hours, there's a ton of patchouli, melded to dry dusty vetiver and dark incense resins. Around 6 hours, the vanilla and amber take over, and before long, it is suddenly very syrupy sweet amber without any of the dark woody notes.
Verdict: This isn't very balanced as perfumes go, but it is great as a very dark, sweet, resinous scent. Masculine-leaning but not at all cologney. My biggest complaint is after 6 hours, it gets far too syrupy sweet for me – but I tend to prefer a drier, spicier take on amber. Sillage is strong and longevity is good, easily 10 hours before becoming faint.
Summary: Honeyed beeswax, rich dark amber, and earthy vetiver and patchouli. Ends sweet syrupy amber.
Shapeshifter
Mysterious moonflowers and jasmine are darkened with stealth black leather, opium and smoked amber
In the vial, this is basically smoky cherry cough syrup, which scares me. But after a minute on my skin, it turns into a reddish, somehow non-foody take on charred marshmallow, with sharp leather in the background. By 30 minutes, it's very smoky amber with a thread of something fruity (opium?) and a grounding of very dark leather – a balance of smoky and sweet.
Around an hour, it's very smoky with that subtle cough-syrup thing still going on, and something kind of musky, almost sweaty. That doesn't sound very nice at all, admittedly, but it's strangely enticing. By 4 hours, it still has a slightly syrupy red quality under a thick veil of smoke, along with a very creamy thick floral, kind of like tuberose – which could be the combination of white flowers and creamy amber. By around 7 hours, this is mostly vanilla-y amber with a faintly smoky trail.
Verdict: Despite an unpleasant start, I really like it. It's unique and definitely very complex, with sweet, smoky, resinous, floral, musky, and even red fruit aspects playing together. Very unisex. Sillage is on the low side of average, longevity is average.
Summary: Complex, sweet, and smoky, with dark leather, a creamy floral, and a subtle cherry cough syrup undercurrent
Conclusion
From this order overall, my favorite is definitely Jamila, but it would have competition from Set if not for the syrupy amber drydown. I also really like Maman Brigitte, Shapeshifter, Brigid, La Maceta, and Marie LaVeau. Still not quite sure what to make of Apollo, and Kali Ma and March (Storm Moon) were too soapy for me. Even so, this is a good success rate for me.
Overall – would definitely order again. I liked that all of the scents were evocative and true to inspiration, and I'm willing to brave a long TAT for great quality perfumes.

The speed that electronics like your cell phone can achieve is largely governed by how fast electrons can move about within the transistors that make up its components. A recent collaboration between Physicists at the King Abdullah University of Science and Technology and Chemists at Imperial College London has produced a much faster organic transistor. Previous, transistors based on small organic molecules were difficult to fabrication because of unpredictable crystallization. Polymer-based organic transistors, on the other hand, have been hindered by low electron transport velocities. The new, faster, transistor uses a combination of the two. By layering small organic molecules on top of a polymer-based substrate, the researchers were able to get the best of both worlds, and fabricated organic transistors with unprecedented electron transport speeds. "In principle, this simple blend approach could lead to the development of organic transistors with performing characteristics well beyond the current state-of-the-art," added Dr. Anthopoulous, the head investigator of the Imperial College London group.

Today, EDRi joined forces with 72 other civil society organisations from the five continents of the world to ask European Telecom Regulators to uphold net neutrality in the current negotiations about the future of the Open Internet in the European Union.
The Body of European Regulators of Electronic Communication (BEREC) and the 28 telecom regulators are currently negotiating guidelines that will clarify the recently adopted net neutrality law in the EU. A public consultation will be launched by BEREC in June, lasting for twenty working days, as a result of which the final guidelines will have to be published by 30 August 2016.
BEREC has a crucial role in ensuring the open democratic internet. Failure will be bad for Europe and bad for the world
, said Joe McNamee, Executive Director of European Digital Rights (EDRi).
In this important letter, 73 NGOs from around the world ask the EU Regulators to establish strong guidelines for net neutrality in Europe. In order to respect the Regulation's stated aim of ensuring “the continued functioning of the internet ecosystem as an engine of innovation”, we urge BEREC to adopt guidelines give real meaning to this goal, including:
Careful consideration of so-called “Specialised Services”;
The reaffirmation that zero rating is prohibited under the regulation; and
Strictly non-discriminatory traffic management and a clear statement opposing intrusive traffic management that would restrict internet users' privacy.
In order to fix some of the ambiguities of the EU net neutrality regulation, on 31 March EDRi and the SaveTheInternet coalition partners launched a consultation to give citizens more time to tell the regulators what they think about the open internet in Europe. EDRi is also part of RespectMyNet, which is a campaign to encourage internet users to report net neutrality violations all over the European Union.

CORVALLIS, Ore. - Young children who are able to pay attention and persist with a task have a 50 percent greater chance of completing college, according to a new study at Oregon State University.
Tracking a group of 430 preschool-age children, the study gives compelling evidence that social and behavioral skills, such as paying attention, following directions and completing a task may be even more crucial than academic abilities.
And the good news for parents and educators, the researchers said, is that attention and persistence skills are malleable and can be taught.
The results were just published online in Early Childhood Research Quarterly.
"There is a big push now to teach children early academic skills at the preschool level," said Megan McClelland, an OSU early child development researcher and lead author of the study. "Our study shows that the biggest predictor of college completion wasn't math or reading skills, but whether or not they were able to pay attention and finish tasks at age 4."
Parents of preschool children were asked to rate their children on items such as "plays with a single toy for long periods of time" or "child gives up easily when difficulties are encountered." Reading and math skills were assessed at age 7 using standardized assessments. At age 21, the same group was tested again for reading and math skills.
Surprisingly, achievement in reading and math did not significantly predict whether or not the students completed college. Instead, researchers found that children who were rated higher by their parents on attention span and persistence at age 4 had nearly 50 percent greater odds of getting a bachelor's degree by age 25.
McClelland, who is a nationally-recognized expert in child development, said college completion has been shown in numerous studies to lead to higher wages and better job stability. She said the earlier that educators and parents can intervene, the more likely a child can succeed academically.
"We didn't look at how well they did in college or at grade point average," McClelland said. "The important factor was being able to focus and persist. Someone can be brilliant, but that doesn't necessarily mean they can focus when they need to and finish a task or job."
McClelland, who is also a core director in OSU's Hallie E. Ford Center for Healthy Children and Families, said interventions aimed at increasing young children's self-control abilities have repeatedly shown to help boost "self-regulation," or a child's ability to listen, pay attention, follow through on a task and remember instructions.
In a past study, McClelland found that simple, active classroom games such as Simon Says and Red Light/Green Light have been effective tools for increasing both literacy and self-regulation skills.
"Academic ability carries you a long way, but these other skills are also important," McClelland said. "Increasingly, we see that the ability to listen, pay attention, and complete important tasks is crucial for success later in life."
OSU's Alan Acock, along with Andrea Piccinin of the University of Victoria and Sally Ann Rhea and Michael Stallings of the University of Colorado, contributed to this study, which was funded by the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development and a Colorado Adoption Project grant.
Cointelegraph: Nxt includes an innovative “proof-of-stake” feature which essentially means that coins are not created by “mining.” How then are Nxt coins created and put into circulation?
NXT: All the 1,000,000,000 NXT were available within the Genesis Block (= first block) and got distributed to the initial stakeholders. It was hardcoded into the source code.
Transaction fees are how NXT are re-circulated back into the network. Currently transaction fees are generated by sending NXT, assigning aliases, using the arbitrary messaging feature, issuing, buying or selling the assets. Transaction fees are currently set at a minimum of 1 NXT per payment. As NXT price increases, the minimum fee is planned to be reduced to continue to allow micro-transactions to be practical. The total fee reached 1,112,084 NXT after 6 months. 4,697,286,927 NXT were already transferred (= 4.7 x total supply of NXT).
CT: Being considered a second-gen cryptocurrency, do you see Nxt making Bitcoin obsolete or can both have their specific uses and co-exist?
NXT : Andreas M. Antonopoulos often says: there will be millions of cryptos and they will happily co-exist. David Johnson [Mastercoin] also shares this opinion; there will always be a space for more players, since each crypto aims for specific users. Nxt is to Bitcoin probably like Android to Nokia or Tesla Model S is to a Volkswagen Beetle. So people will still use Nokia or drive Volkswagen. But the geeks will choose Nxt. Or not, this will also depend on cooperating payment systems, like GoCoin.
But originally, due to its Java roots, proof-of-stake hashing and ability to trim/reduce the blockchain, NXT is extremely well suited for use on small, low-power, low-resource devices. It would be easy to imagine and implement NXT on low-powered, always connected devices such as smart phones. The majority of the network could be supported on these devices. Since millions of people worldwide already possess smart phones, NXT could quickly be deployed among these devices to help support the network without the costs associated with traditional crypto-currencies.
NXT features, such as instant transactions make smart phones an optimal platform for use the use of NXT in everyday monetary transactions [Food, Fuel, etc.]. While solutions exist for other crypto-currencies (e.g. Bitcoin) in this realm, the use of these devices does not actually contribute to the stability or health of their networks because of the massive resources (computing power) needed to maintain these networks. With NXT, any device that has the ability to send and receive transactions also has the necessary computing power to add to the network stability and further decentralization.
CT: Pre-mining is often seen in the negative light by the community. Do you think the pre-mine approach was a good strategy for Nxt? Can pre-mine be the right strategy in some instances?
NXT : As the Bitcoin network becomes stronger, there is less and less incentive for an individual peer to keep supporting the network as their potential reward is split among more and more peers. Some peers keep adding resources at the cost of both specialized, proprietary, expensive hardware and increasing energy costs. As time goes by, the network becomes more and more centralized as smaller peers (those who can do less work) drop out as their reward goes more and more towards larger peers (those who can afford more resources and energy).
In the proof-of-stake hashing model used by NXT, network security is governed by peers having 'stake' in the network. In order to achieve the 100% proof-of-stake model, the pre-mine was needed. In the crypto world, you can collect up to 3,000 IPO investors, if it was very cheap. But even this number is too small if you compare it to Billions of people around the world. If you study the distribution charts, you can see that the distribution of the Dollar is worse than Bitcoin and the distribution of Bitcoin is more unfair than Nxt. But your wife probably doesn't care about unfair distribution of gold among the richest people/corporations; she just wants you to buy her new golden earrings.
CT: What about transparent forging? How does this work, and when will that feature be fully implemented?
NXT : The chance of forging a block for an actively forging account is proportional to its amount of NXT compared to all active forging NXT in the network. A small amount of randomness is required to eliminate the possibility of attacks based on knowing the far future forgers, but the near future should be as close to deterministic as possible to allow significant reduction in network bandwidth usage.
Transparent forging allows for a centralized action in a decentralized network. This is the fundamental breakthrough that NXT incorporates. Transparent forging allow each users client to automatically determine who will generate the next block, so that they can then send their transactions to that node. This allows additional fees to be realized for immediate/priority transactions. An equally important feature of Transparent forging is an outstanding security feature of the protocol to temporarily reduce to zero the forging power of nodes who should generate the next block but don't.
This feature is designed to prevent against even a 90% majority owner of all NXT branching out and forcing a fork. So if a node that has 90% of all NXT doesn't generate a block when scheduled, the system will reduce its mining power to zero temporarily to prevent a bad fork from being forced. Its mining power is distributed out to the rest of the network so the network is still at 100% and thus whatever this potential adversary is doing on its other branch can be counteracted by some mechanisms of advanced consensus.
Time Warp is a feature of Transparent Forging that will support very high transactions per second within Nxt.
CT: When can we expect to Nxt to implement its own decentralized exchange?
NXT : Part of the Nxt Platform is the Asset Exchange that is a decentralized exchange that aims to make centralized Exchanges redundant. People can trade with each other directly, securely and cheaply and not just currencies but any other assets users choose to create. Right now you can trade NEM, NHZ, QORA, NAS coins and some new coins created only for AE, like MIC. But the gateways are still centralized. Nxt needs decentralized multigateway for 100% decentralized exchange. Multigateway is currently under beta testing. So the release could be in the next month.
CT: What are some planned or currently in-development features for NXT that you're excited about?
NXT : InstantDEX is an important service built on top of Nxt's Multigateway service and Nxt Asset Exchange and has been shown in a proof of concept to have achieved ~5 second transaction times. The goal of InstantDEX is to allow for real time trading of any Nxt Asset against any other Nxt Asset.
Monetary System will allow you to create currencies backed by NXT. New coins are created by "locking" NXTs. This could be thought as similar to “burning” Nxt but this is inaccurate as the process can be reversed. If you destroy 7% of the supply the created coins then you get 7% of the locked NXTs back. You are unable to lock more NXTs into the coin once it is created so the supply can't be inflated.
Automated Transaction will be trustless Escrows. Work is being done on a Turing-complete scripting layer that can operate on top of the Nxt blockchain. "Turing-complete" is a term that means the scripting language is not limited in scope and can compute anything. This Nxt application will allow for the creation of Distributed Autonomous Corporations (DACs) that can issue transactions automatically, based on a set of rules.
Cointelegraph had the chance to catch up with the NXT team . Known for its less resource-intensive mining and 100% proof-of-stake, it is no wonder why NXT recently surpassed the popular Dogecoin by market cap. But exchange rate and speculation aside, the NXT team explains why it is the "next" step in the evolution of cryptocurrencies and why Bitcoin is just the beginning.
An Islamic State leader has spoken out about his life as one of the world's most wanted terrorists in a startlingly frank interview.
In the sensational interview, Rachid Kassim claimed beheading ISIS prisoners was 'a pleasure' and said the saddest thing about fleeing France for Syria was leaving his pet cat behind.
He is one of the world's most wanted men after he was linked to a string of terror attacks in Europe, including the murder of a Catholic priest near Normandy in France, and the slaughter of a policeman and his partner near Paris.

Kassim gave his first on-the-record interview to Washington-based academic Amarnath Amarasingam, who researches jihadism
French-born Kassim also appeared in a propaganda video for Islamic State just six days after Mohamed Lahouaiej Bouhel murdered 86 people in the July Nice terror attack, which took place in on Bastille Day.
In the footage he praised the attack, promised more atrocities in France, and beheaded a prisoner on film.
The 29-year-old is also believed to have run an encrypted app called Telegram, used by jihadists to share tips on how to carry out terror attacks.

The app was taken offline by French security services in September.
Kassim gave the on-the-record interview to Washington-based academic Amarnath Amarasingam, who researches jihadism, the Mirror reports.
When asked how it had felt to behead a prisoner, he said: 'To behead an animal, it would be difficult, with enemies of Allah, it is a pleasure.'
Kassim, also known as Ibn Qassim. also revealed that he fled France after being placed under constant surveillance because of his radical views.
Kassim has been linked to the murder of priest Jacques Hamel in the church of Saint-Etienne-du-Rouvray, Normandy
He left for Syria in the middle of the night, taking his wife and young daughter with him with just 1,500 Euros in his pocket.
'I thought of attacking France when I was there, and my family was afraid because of it,' he said.
'The cops knew about me. Every time I went jogging, there were always two cops following me. Then they hide. It was ridiculous.
'We left everything behind. Especially my cat. I had a wonderful cat that I left in Gaziantep. It was one of the saddest things about my hijrah (migration to Syria).'
The terror leader, who said he does not fear the defeat of ISIS in Mosul, also claimed that any attempts made by western authorities to stop jihadists travelling to Syria would only result in more atrocities on home soil.
'We believe that even a small attack in dar ul-kufr (non-Muslim lands) is better than a big attack in Syria,' he said.
'As the door of hijrah closes, the door of jihad opens. If I stayed in dar ul-kufr, I would do an attack there.'
He also used his first on the record interview to encourage his followers to carry out more atrocities.
The fight over the marriage amendment intensified Monday, as the lead group pushing the measure brought in advocates from Canada who say that legalizing same-sex marriage has radically transformed the country over the past decade.
Speakers told attendees of the three-hour seminar at University of St. Thomas Law School that elementary schools teach students about same-sex relationships and that parents who try to protect children from these teachings have no ability to intervene.
"Do Minnesotans want to live in a state where you have to take your kid's school to court to find out what they are being taught?" asked Steve Tourloukis, who is suing his Ontario school district to give parents ultimate authority over what their children are taught. Minnesota for Marriage and the Minnesota Catholic Conference hosted the event as they prepare for the final weeks of their fight. The groups are urging Minnesotans to support a constitutional amendment that would define marriage as only the union of a man and woman. Same-sex marriage is already illegal in Minnesota, but amendment supporters argue that future legislators or judges could change the law, as happened in Canada.
Minnesotans United for All Families, which opposes the amendment, responded with a "Canada Fact Check" memo debunking many claims at the event and accused the sponsors of wrongly connecting what happened when Canada passed a gender-neutral definition of marriage in 2005, with what could happen in Minnesota.
The deep divide over the marriage amendment in the Catholic Church also was in evidence at the seminar, when the Rev. Mike Tegeder, a marriage amendment opponent, was barred by the archdiocese from attending the meeting unless he followed certain ground rules.
After receiving an invitation that went out to many clergy, Tegeder RSVP'd. Minnesota Catholic Conference executive director Jason Adkins then sent an e-mail to Tegeder establishing "ground rules" for his attendance.
"You will sit where I tell you to sit, and if you refuse, you will be escorted out by UST security," Adkins wrote. "If you disrupt the event in any way, or speak out of turn, I will direct University [of St. Thomas] security to remove you."
Tegeder, head pastor at St. Frances Cabrini Church in Minneapolis, said the directive was "a symbol of their lack of confidence and lack of faith in what they are trying to do."
Archbishop John Nienstedt, a leading supporter of the amendment, had already ordered Tegeder to not publicly oppose his teaching on the issue.
Tegeder attended Monday's event and watched quietly from the second-floor balcony, but is not relenting in criticizing the church's position on the amendment.
"A bishop who has protected pedophiles is talking to us about protecting children," Tegeder said. "My God, it is unconscionable."
Nienstedt has endured criticism for defending Pope Benedict after allegations he was involved in a massive coverup of child sex cases. The archbishop has also been criticized for going to court to recover legal fees from a person who sued the church claiming sexual abuse by a former priest. That suit was later dismissed.
Adkins said Tegeder has a history of being "disruptive" at similar events.
"He decided to make an issue out of me giving him some basic rules of decorum, so I decided not to be bothered with him," Adkins said. "My policy had nothing to do with his disagreement" with the archbishop.
Lawsuits predicted
Panelists urged Minnesotans to approve the amendment, warning of a new cottage industry of lawsuits stemming from demands of same-sex couples.
Albertos Polizogopoulos, a Canadian lawyer and same-sex marriage opponent, said he envisions a day soon when a male couple will sue the state to pay for a surrogate mother to conceive a child.
"What's scary is that they are going to win. It is a scary time in Canada," he said. "You are fortunate to be at a time where you can have your voice heard on this. Don't waste it."

Screens? Where we're going, we don't need screens. The Typlet T1S is a Windows or Android computer that projects its display onto tables and walls, while using a series of infrared sensors to register your touch input.
Available later this year for around $700, the TS1 will come in Android or Windows versions. Typlet demonstrated a working protype of the TS1 at CES and I was able to spend a few minutes looking at the output on a white table and tapping the virtual screen with a finger.
Hands-On Experience
I was impressed with both the relative clarity of the image, which is a modest 854 x 480 resolution, and the device's quick and usually accurate response to my taps. I also watched as a company rep navigating through the Android OS, played a fish game and typed on Android's virtual keyboard. The projection on the table was a perfectly square 14 inches. The device can also project a much larger, 90-inch image onto a wall.
Because the infrared sensors are positioned in the TS1's base, you can't use your fingers to touch an image that's projected on the wall. To solve this problem, the device comes with a wireless stylus that works on horizontal projections. Unfortunately, no matter how you touch it, the TS1 doesn't support multitouch gestures.
Why You Should Care
The TS1's ability to track your touches opens up a whole world of possibilities. We can imagine using it to power a public kiosk, where the actual projector would be secured and users would only be able to interact with the images. It would also be ideal for business presentations or education where the teacher or presenter can manipulate horizontal projections with the pen.
Specs, Cheaper Model
Typlet didn't share a lot of information about the TS1's components. Company reps told me it would be available with Windows or Android but didn't say what CPU it would have. Typlet is also coming out with the $400 T2, which will be a touch screen projector only and require you to attach your own computer to it.
Outlook
The TS1 is a rather unique device that makes for a cool demo, but for businesses or consumers to spend $700, it's going to have to provide a really powerful experience. There are some compelling use cases for businesses, but the high price tag and relatively low resolution are drawbacks.
An organisation called Border Communities Against Brexit staged demonstrations at six border locations this afternoon, highlighting the UK's plans to the leave the European Union.
Participants handed out leaflets saying the 'hard Brexit' policy of British Prime Minister Theresa May would mean severe restrictions on those who live in the border region.
They claimed Brexit would mean the introduction of customs check points and would have far-reaching, negative economic consequences.
They said their aim is to force the British and Irish governments to respect the will of the majority of the Northern Ireland electorate who voted to remain in the EU.
One of the largest demonstrations was held at Carrickarnon, between Newry and Dundalk, where the organisers put in place a mock customs building and a lengthy tailback of traffic was created by the crowds.
"We want to stop the reimposition of those border posts," said Border Communities Against Brexit spokesman Declan Fearon.
Mr Fearon runs a furniture business near Jonesboro in South Armagh. His family are well-known in the area.
His niece, Megan, is a Sinn Féin junior minister in the Stormont Assembly.
The protest had the appearances of a campaign driven by nationalists. In their literature the references were to 'The North', rather than Northern Ireland.
Politicians from several parties attended the meeting. The speakers included representatives of businesses from both sides of the border.
Captain Marvel
Real Name: None
Identity/Class: Extra-terrestrial android
Occupation: Ambassador to and protector off humanity
Affiliations: Billy Baxton (ward, confidant); Linda Knowles (girlfriend); Tinyman
Enemies: Plastic Man (not the Quality Comics one); Elastic Man; Tinyman; Atom-Jaw; Dr.Fate; The Bat (a.k.a. The Ray); The Terrible Five (including The Destroyer, Big Max, Tarzec)

Aliases: Mr.Marvel, Roger Winkle, The Human Robot
Base of Operations: Dartmoor College, U.S.A.
First Appearance: Captain Marvel #1 (M.F. Enterprises, April, 1966)
Powers/Abilities: Able to split his body apart at the joints, and have each segment act independently, able to fly about apparently unaided. He utters the comman "Split" to separate, and must say "Xam" to join the parts back together again. He can even split off individual finger segments. However if glass is interposed between body parts and the head, which controls them, he loses control of them. He wears jet-boots, and carries an amulet around his neck containing an element "X" which keeps him energized - if this is removed from him for too long he will go into hibernation. He can switch between civilian clothes and his costume with a thought, causing them to simply fade out. He can also can shoot laser beams from his eyes, deflect bullets, emit electric shocks, an "iron constitution" and has some form of telepathy. Plus he is superintelligent - all in all, quite a collection of powers for a character with so few appearances.
History: Created by scientists on an alien planet, Captain Marvel is sent to Earth to promote and preserve peace, mere moments before the world that spawned him is destroyed in a massive explosion. His rocket lands in Riverview, where, suffering from temporary amnesia, he makes the acquaintance of Earth boy Billy Baxton
Comments: Created by Carl Burgos and Roger Elwood.
Captain Marvel's title lasted four issues, and he also appeared in two issues of Captain Marvel Presents the Terrible Five (strangley enough, numbered #1 and #5, suggesting the latter might have been a continuation of his original title).
Since the element in the amulet is called X, the amulet naturally has a large letter...M (?) emblazoned on it. Oh well.
M.F. Publishing, the company which produced this incarnation of Captain Marvel, was named after owner Myron Fass. The only other titles it produced during its short publication life were Henry Brewster (an Archie-style comic) and Great West (unsurprisingly a Western).
CLARIFICATIONS: Not to be confused with
Captain Marvel, the Big Red Cheese
any of the various Marvel Comics' Captain Marvels
the Human Torch, another robot in a red jumpsuit created by Carl Burgos

WHO: Michael Brown, the disgraced head of FEMA during Hurricane Katrina WHAT: The real story of how and why this hopelessly unqualified individual was placed in this sensitive post WHY: A web of self-interest, undergirded by a philosophical contempt for government and the governed.
This article was originally assigned, accepted, and paid for in full by Vanity Fair — which never got around to publishing it, and graciously released it to the author. It tells the story of the cronyism, corruption, ineptness, contempt for the public and utter shamelessness of the Bush family apparatus and its extensive network. With yet another Bush now contesting the White House, and with the 10th anniversary of Hurricane Katrina upon us, we would do well to study this closely. It documents unequivocally how greed and self-interest in high places can tear apart the very fabric of American society. Originally written within months of Hurricane Katrina, it will still make your blood boil.
This week we publish it in five parts. It has been slightly updated from the original.
Days after Louisiana's Governor Kathleen Blanco declared a state of emergency and the National Hurricane Center warned the White House that Hurricane Katrina could top the New Orleans levee system, the only FEMA official actually in the city itself — Marty J. Bahamonde — was not even supposed to be there. He had been sent in advance of the storm and was ordered to leave as it bore down, but could not because of the clogged roads.
Michael Brown, the head of FEMA (the Federal Emergency Management Agency), was known to have made it as far as Baton Rouge but seemed out of reach.
On Wednesday, August 31, with tens of thousands trapped in the Superdome and looting out of control in the parts of the city still above water, Bahamonde e-mailed Brown directly: “I know you know, the situation is past critical …. Hotels are kicking people out, thousands gathering in the streets with no food or water.'”
The response, when it came several hours later, was from a Brown aide, and did not address the warnings, but noted Brown's desire to appear on a television program that evening. It included this key caveat: “It is very important that time is allowed for Mr. Brown to eat dinner.”
A week later, Brown would be replaced as on-site manager of the disaster.
Blamed for his role in one of the largest domestic debacles in American history, Brown was still thinking of his own comfort: “I'm going to go home and walk my dog and hug my wife, and maybe get a good Mexican meal and a stiff margarita and a full night's sleep,” he told the AP.
In the midst of America's worst natural — and manmade — disaster, it became clear that Brown was indeed lost in Margaritaville.
The response from Brown's aide came several hours later: “It is very important that time is allowed for Mr. Brown to eat dinner.”
Katrina showed that much of the Bush-appointed federal leadership was every bit as unqualified as Brown. Each new crisis seemed to expose still more cronyism, patronage and nepotism at the very top of the country's leading agencies: a Medicare administrator who came from the hospital association and stayed just long enough to do its bidding; judicial nominees without appropriate experience; dubious appointments to agencies touching everything from mine safety to immigration and customs. The list of shame goes on and on.
We still do not know the true extent to which the government was filled with Michael Browns. This is in part because of the media. At one time, major news organizations had a reporter assigned to each large federal bureaucracy, making it harder to sail these appointments through, and harder to hide incompetence and malfeasance. Now it takes a disaster to expose these things — when it is too late.
But Michael Brown will forever remain the poster child for federal incompetence — and worse. So a central question remains: Who is Michael Brown, and how did he end up at the helm of the Federal Emergency Management Agency?
Indeed, how did he and his predecessor and mentor, Joe Allbaugh, a Bush political operative, manage to turn FEMA, a once proud and effective disaster-relief agency, into a national disaster?
A Secret Relationship
On any level, it makes absolutely no sense that Michael Brown should have been holding any major government post. He had been a failed lawyer whose previous job ostensibly consisted of scrutinizing the ethics of judges in Arabian Horse competitions. In his highest pre-FEMA governmental job, he had been the quintessential neophyte: assistant to a city manager in a small Oklahoma city — and that had been decades before he came to Washington.
“Brownie” lacked any of the other usual connections or qualifications one might expect to see in such an appointee. He had done no known political work for George W. Bush — a typical path to patronage jobs.
He had no real background in emergency or logistics work of any kind. He was not a major donor. He was not even among the untold number of Bush family associates, allies, and friends.
The only answer the public has ever gotten as to why Michael Brown headed FEMA is peculiar and highly dissatisfying: Joe Allbaugh wanted him there.
Allbaugh is the brash and powerful but little-known Bush confidant who preceded Brown as FEMA director. When Allbaugh came to Washington, he brought Brown with him and rapidly promoted him until Brown was positioned to take over the agency.
But why Michael Brown? When pressed, the taciturn Allbaugh tersely replied that Brown was a lifelong friend in whom he had confidence. To this moment, that has remained the official, indeed only, explanation of how and why Michael Brown was running FEMA when Hurricane Katrina struck.
But a thorough investigation, encompassing scores of interviews and hundreds of documents, has uncovered another reality.
It begins with this astonishing fact: Nearly all of Joe Allbaugh's friends and acquaintances say they had never heard of Michael Brown, never met him, never even seen the two men in each other's presence. To them, Brown was a complete stranger.
The truth, as we have learned, is that the relationship between the two men had been hidden. The secret, decades-long partnership was designed to advance both men's business and personal interests.
By all appearances, that explains why Allbaugh asked Bush to let him run FEMA, and why he then turned the place over to Brown. Indeed, as soon as Allbaugh left the agency, he began cashing in.
FEMA after the Allbaugh-Brown era was staffed by people put into position by the two men, and run by David Paulison, best known for advising Americans to stock up on duct tape as protection against future terrorist attacks.
Is this really just about incompetence? Or has a debilitating “culture of corruption” become deeply embedded in agencies like FEMA on which we literally rely for our lives?
Qualifications? Very Secret
In a more perfect world, the media, Congress, and engaged citizens would have wanted to know a great deal about Joe Allbaugh and Michael Brown before they were confirmed to serve in important positions. Even just a hard look at Brown's last job before FEMA would have set off alarms.
For a decade, Brown was Commissioner of Judges and Stewards of the International Arabian Horse Association (IAHA). It is unclear what his qualifications were for that job; nonetheless it was the longest employment he ever had, and his most prestigious. But Brown knew it was a singularly inappropriate qualification for the leadership of FEMA: FEMA's official Brown biography, posted on its website, did not mention this job at all. It turns out that Brown had good reason to be quiet about this chapter of his life.
While most folks who knew Brown were startled to see a person of such modest accomplishments in a high post, IAHA member Karl Hart was not: “Brown had been saying for six months or more that, if Bush was elected, he was going to have a high position in Washington.”
When the new IAHA post was created, members were told that their leadership had sought a person with several key characteristics: competency, experience — and total independence from the cronyism of the horse world.
In fact, what they got was the opposite. In retrospect, it looks like the fix was in for this position too.
Brown's job was to address concerns about the integrity of the horse-judging process. But the main thing Brown did was to pursue an “investigation” of the sport's most successful trainer, a man who had angered powerful people with connections at the top of the Republican Party.
Karl Hart, a Florida lawyer and longtime IAHA member who headed the group's legal review committee, describes Brown's efforts in this regard as an “obsessive vendetta.”
The trainer, David Boggs, was accused of cosmetically altering the appearance of a horse, a serious violation of competition rules. Brown ordered Boggs banned from the show circuit for five years, a Draconian punishment tantamount to putting the trainer out of business. Boggs's competitors were delighted.
Boggs (who did not respond to interview requests) was, by most accounts, a talented and dedicated trainer. But according to Hart and others, he was hated by several Arabian Horse owners — who also happened to be very large Republican donors, including the late Bob Magness, a founder of the TCI cable giant; David Murdock, the Dole food company billionaire; and the late Alec Courtelis, a Florida developer.
Courtelis had been one of George H.W. Bush's major fundraisers, and the elder Bush was a frequent overnight guest at Courtelis's horse farm during his presidency. This was a very, very close relationship.
At an April 1990 fundraising dinner, Bush introduced Courtelis with the words, “Here's a man who breeds racehorses for the same reason he works so hard for the party: only one place will do for Alec — first place.”
It is impossible to overstate the significance of George H.W. “Poppy” Bush's taking a strong interest in helping this prominent backer. (As readers of my book Family of Secrets will know, the elder Bush had a well-concealed involvement with CIA covert operations throughout his life, long before his brief stint as a “civilian” CIA director — and long after.) Poppy Bush's ability to make things happen and make certain problems disappear must be considered as one ponders how and why Michael Brown was moved into IAHA and proceeded to demolish Courtelis's foe.
In any case, Hart and other IAHA elders say they're not sure whether Boggs was guilty, but since the horse in question became the preeminent sire of the breed, Hart thinks genetics may have been a more likely factor in its near-perfect profile than cosmetic surgery. In any case, Boggs filed a battery of lawsuits against both the association and Brown, the financial toll of which contributed to the association's near-bankruptcy.
There is no evidence that the big donors knew in advance about plans to hire Brown; Courtelis and Magness are deceased, and Murdock did not respond to an interview request. Yet, Brown's performance clearly pleased influential sectors of the IAHA, as is apparent from the special treatment he was accorded.
While other staffers had to report working each day, Brown, on a full salary, was allowed to work from his sprawling, mountain-air home in Lyons, a distant suburb of Denver, the city in which IAHA was located. His lifestyle was so pleasant and relaxed that some in Lyons assumed him to be semi-retired. James Van Dyke, chef-owner at Lyons' Gateway Café, says Brown had leisurely lunches at the restaurant almost daily. “He seemed to have a lot of time on his hands,” says Van Dyke.
“He … pushed me into a closet”
Brown's single-minded pursuit of Boggs contrasted sharply with a pronounced reluctance to pursue another case that seemed to have considerable merit — one involving Murdock's trainer, who was accused of filing false papers for a show horse.
Ironically, it would be Murdock himself, in his zeal to help Brown, who would eventually sink him. One day, he mentioned to Hart that, at Brown's request, he'd written him a $50,000 personal check, ostensibly for a legal defense fund to deal with Boggs's suits. Hart was staggered to hear this, since the association was already paying Brown's legal bills.
Hart took Brown aside at an IAHA board meeting and told him what he knew. Brown panicked. “He grabbed me, literally, and pushed me into a closet,” says Hart. “He said, ‘Is there any way you and I can work this out?'”
There wasn't, and Brown was terminated immediately.
But only a few months later, in February 2001, he resurfaced as general counsel, and later deputy director and chief operating officer, of the vast bureaucracy at FEMA.
While most folks who knew Brown over the years were startled to see a person of such modest accomplishments in a high Washington post, the IAHA brass was not. As Hart recalls, “Brown had been saying for six months or more that, if Bush was elected, he was going to have a high position in Washington because he was very close to someone who was very active in Bush's campaign.”
TOMORROW: In Part 2 of this series, we learn the hidden, real reason that Michael Brown, with no appropriate qualifications or experience, was brought into this important federal agency. We also discover shocking details of his past that should have disqualified him not only from running FEMA, but from any position of responsibility, period.

Though it is little noted in discussions of this year's election, Senator Bernie Sanders's campaign has brought back the essential message of then-Senator Barack Obama's “Yes We Can” campaign of 2008. The core of that message is the word “we,” in contrast with former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's frequent use of “I.” However this year's election turns out, the idea that the people — not politicians — are the most fundamental driver of change is back in the public discussion.
The contrast between “we” and “I” has old roots in the progressive tradition. Debates about “socialism” are a diversion — both Sanders and Clinton have legitimate claims to be progressive. But they represent different strands of the progressive tradition: the expert tradition and the populist tradition.
Progressivism emerged in the late 19th century and early 20th century as a movement to roll back the excesses of Gilded Age capitalism. Progressives believed in a positive role for government in taming the market. They believed in the principle of social change. They valued science. They affirmed the intrinsic worth and dignity of human beings.
But as David Thelen, past editor of the Journal of American History and a leading historian of progressivism, argued in his essay “Two Traditions of Progressive Reform” and other works, beyond these general agreements were two different tendencies. One was oriented toward bureaucracy and expert decision-making; the other was more populist, focused on grassroots democracy and participation.
Donna Shalala — longtime Hillary Clinton confidant, secretary of health and human services during President Bill Clinton's administration and now president of the Clinton Foundation — expressed clearly the tenets of the expert tradition back in 1989, in “Mandate for a New Century,” a now-famous speech she delivered as chancellor of the University of Wisconsin-Madison. Shalala called upon higher education to engage with the problems of the world, from racism and sexism to environmental degradation, war and poverty. She also voiced the view that scientifically trained experts — “a disinterested technocratic elite” — should be at the center of decision-making. As Shalala put it:
The idea of society's best and brightest in service to its most needy, irrespective of any particular political philosophy … is an idea of such great elegance… We all need to see our gifted researchers set about the work that will eliminate the cripplers we face now as thoroughly, if not as swiftly, as our research eliminated juvenile rickets in the past.
Hillary Clinton's “fighting for you” channels these expert-driven ideas. It places Clinton in the role of savior of the disadvantaged and marginalized — Shalala's “best and brightest in service to its most needy.” Clinton's calls for collective effort also suggest expert consultation. “We've got to get our heads together to come up with the best answers to solve the problems so that people can have real differences in their lives,” Clinton said in her concluding remarks in a debate with Sanders on February 4, 2016.
However, the democratic tradition of progressivism has long been animated by populist movements: labor union organizing, civil rights, educational reform, the struggles of farmers to keep their farms and other such crusades. Progressive intellectuals with a grassroots democratic bent like Jane Addams, John Dewey, A. Philip Randolph and Alain Locke all had strong ties to these movements. So too did Henry Wallace, Franklin Roosevelt's secretary of agriculture and then-vice president, who in 1942 delivered a speech entitled “Century of the Common Man.” Wallace's speech explicitly challenged Life publisher Henry Luce's “American Century” essay of 1941, which claimed warrant for America as global policeman. Wallace's tenure as secretary of agriculture also encompassed a little-remembered but enormous effort to democratize decision-making around how American farmland is used, from 1938 to 1941. Detailed in Jess Gilbert's 2015 book Planning Democracy, this movement showed how participatory democracy could take place with government acting as an empowering partner to its citizens — neither savior nor enemy.
This populist, small-D democratic tradition of progressivism was revived in the civil rights movement of the 1950s and 1960s. It surfaced again in the community-organizing movement of the 1970s and 1980s, which fundamentally shaped a young Barack Obama in Chicago.
Obama took the message of grassroots democracy which he had learned from community organizing to the nation in the 2008 campaign, amplifying its themes and engaging millions of people. “I'm asking you not only to believe in my ability to make change,” read the campaign website. “I'm asking you to believe in yours.” The message was expressed in such memorable campaign slogans as, “We are the ones we've been waiting for,” drawn from a song of the freedom movement of the 1960s. And it infused Obama's field operation. As Rolling Stone reporter Tim Dickinson noted, the goal was “not to put supporters to work but to enable them to put themselves to work, without having to depend on the campaign for constant guidance.”
“We decided that we didn't want to train volunteers,” Obama field director Temo Figueroa explained to Dickinson. “We want to train organizers — folks who can fend for themselves.”
After Obama took office, the democratic promise of his campaign remained largely unrealized. Indeed, after becoming president, Obama's language began to shift from “we” to “I.” At the news conference marking the first 100 days of his administration, Obama was asked what he intended to do as chief shareholder of some of America's largest companies. “I've got two wars I've got to run already,” he laughed. “I've got more than enough to do.” This shift in pronouns paralleled the deactivation of the grassroots base of Obama for America (OFA), which had powered the campaign.
As of election night 2008, OFA included some 2.5 million activists in the.BarackObama social network, four million donors and 13 million email supporters. After the election, the organization's name shifted to “Organizing for America,” at which point a fierce argument erupted among campaign leaders. Deputy campaign manager Steve Hildebrand argued that the new OFA should become an independent nonprofit. Joe Trippi, campaign manager for 2004 Howard Dean race, observed that OFA and its supporters had many independents and some Republicans and shouldn't lose its cross-partisan qualities. Finally, David Plouffe, a key architect of the 2008 campaign was put in charge of OFA. He decided to incorporate the organization as part of the Democratic National Committee.
“The move meant that the machinery of an insurgent candidate, one who had vowed to upend the Washington establishment, would now become part of that establishment, subject to the entrenched, partisan interests of the Democratic Party,” observed Rolling Stone's Dickinson. “It made about as much sense as moving Greenpeace into the headquarters of ExxonMobil.”
Flash forward to 2016, and we find the Democratic campaign tapping into growing activism on many fronts — from Occupy Wall Street and Black Lives Matter to action on climate change and local development. Bernie Sanders's core argument, that a grassroots movement will be necessary for real change, echoes the Obama 2008 message, both in its stress on participatory democracy and in its integration of a range of issues into a larger call for change — “we” language, not “I” language. In his speech after the Iowa caucuses, Sanders said: “The powers that be… are so powerful that no president can do what has to be done alone… When millions of people come together… to stand up and say loudly and clearly, ‘Enough is enough'… when that happens, we will transform this country.” Should Sanders become president, he would pursue a broad activation of citizens. “Bernie Sanders has always identified with the populist side of progressivism,” Huck Gutman, Sanders's chief of staff in the Senate from 2008 to 2012, told me.
It is still possible that Hillary Clinton could pick up themes from the Reinventing Citizenship project I coordinated with Bill Galston, deputy assistant for domestic policy to President Bill Clinton from 1993 to 1995, now of the Brookings Institution. Reinventing Citizenship proposed a number of measures to strengthen government as a partner of citizens in public problem-solving and the work of democracy.
Whatever the outcome of the contest between Clinton and Sanders, the key to real change is the people. The issues that the campaign has raised — the power of Wall Street, economic inequality and stagnant wages, college debt, mass incarceration, universal health care, campaign finance reform, climate change and others — will require citizen power on a large scale if fundamental change is to occur. There are also many other, large-scale issues, crucial to the fate of the nation, that scramble partisan lines: revitalization of the democratic purpose of education; local economic development in the face of radical technological change; the drug epidemic; and reweaving the social fabric in a time of eroding community ties, to name just a few. These are enormous challenges. If the Democratic debate continues and deepens the call for citizen activation, it could well catalyze civic efforts beyond the issues of the campaign.
It is also clear that the idea of “we” has found a resonant audience especially among young people. “Sanders gives young people a place in his campaign,” wrote Elisabeth Bott, one of my students from the University of Minnesota. “For so many people, politics is tainted. Sanders's campaign restores the idea that politics can be a source of change. He understands that we live in a time of change and extreme injustice and wants to change that with the help of us all.”
This idea is not Sanders's alone. Politics — by the definition of the term dating from the Greeks until the modern era — has long involved citizens of diverse views and interests learning to work together to solve common problems, create common good and negotiate a democratic way of life. If we are to reverse the deepening mood of discouragement and powerlessness in the nation, we need wide civic involvement, amounting to a democratic awakening.
In this election, perhaps we see its beginnings.
When Californians vote this November, they'll face the usual candidates for president and senator and other local offices, but they'll also be weighing in on seemingly dozens of measures and propositions. The hefty voters guide offers insight into how to determine the fate of such issues as legalized marijuana, the death penalty and condoms in the adult entertainment industry.
But wouldn't it be fun if TV critics could add a few props of their own to improve the ever-shifting landscape of television today?
Here are 11 that come to mind. I'd vote YES on all. Remember: If you disagree, that's what democracy is all about!
The Fallon/Meyers Prop: There's a time for funny singing impressions, grown-up versions of fraternity games and general inane giggling, but it turns out that election year is a really bad time for that. This proposition would require that every four years, from the New Hampshire Primary through Election Day, that NBC move Seth Meyers up to 11:35 and shift Jimmy Fallon to...some other time. (Opponents of the amendment believe that not everything has to be political and sometimes, especially in moments like this, there's tremendous relief in entertainment that's utterly brainless.)
TV Favorites Return Tariff: This proposal will establish a simple opt-in box on tax returns contributing a dollar to a fund to bring established television favorites back to the medium that's already home to all of entertainment's best writing and directing. Initial beneficiaries will include (but not be limited to) Jennifer Garner, Dennis Franz, James Badge Dale, John Goodman, Betty White, Jennifer Aniston, Connie Britton (assume she's leaving Nashville) and the entire cast of Bloodline. (Opponents of the tariff argue that if Dennis Franz wanted to return to TV, he would have returned to TV already and if Jennifer Aniston is happy with the quality of work that movies are offering her, she shouldn't be forced to team up with an actually talented writer to revitalize her career on TV just because we think she's better than what she's doing.)
Tax Credits for Opening Credit Sequences: Look at Westworld. Isn't it amazing the difference a great opening sequence makes when it comes to pulling viewers into the world of a show? Why are so many shows eschewing credit sequences? Even Mike Schur, who got great credit mileage on Parks and Recreation and Brooklyn Nine-Nine, skipped credits on The Good Place. This proposition would provide tax write-offs for original title sequences with additional write-offs for expositional songs in the Patty Duke Show/Brady Bunch/Gilligan's Island vein. (Opponents of the tax credit say that opening credit sequences take away valuable programming time and that credit sequences are not integral to the branding or mood of a TV show.) Recall the Netflix/Marvel 13: Isn't the great thing about Netflix supposed to be that it doesn't play by the stinking rules and orthodoxy that have governed TV for so long? Then why is it that Netflix's deal with Marvel has forced all of its New York vigilante hero shows to come in with the same bloated 13-episode running length? The first seasons of Jessica Jones, Luke Cage and Daredevil were all really good, but how much better might they have been at 10 episodes? The second season of Daredevil could have been six or eight episodes. And don't even pretend that Punisher, a character who started strong in his Daredevil incarnation but was already spread thin in the weak second half of that season, needs 13 episodes. He doesn't. This recall won't forbid writers from going to 13 if they have enough story to do so, but it also won't require them to do 13 if they don't. Wouldn't it be nice to have a Marvel/Netflix show that maintained its early momentum and didn't star spinning wheels or dropping bottle episodes between hours eight and 11? Consider it. (There are no opponents to this proposition. Vote Yes.)
The Kiss-off Prohibition on Rock and Roll in Primetime: No matter how much Tim Goodman likes it, No matter how much Tim Goodman likes it, Sex&Drugs&Rock&Roll is strike one. Vinyl was strike two. And Roadies was strike three. Showrunners: If Denis Leary, Terence Winter, Martin Scorsese and Cameron Crowe can't make rock music play on TV, chances are good you can't either. (There are no opponents to this proposition. Vote Yes.)
Proposition 21: Granted, Zoey Bartlet was occasionally cool on The West Wing, but she also got kidnapped when Aaron Sorkin ran out of ideas. This proposition requires that in political and political-adjacent shows, if characters have children, they must be of legal drinking age, at a minimum. Nothing good can come from meeting the teenage sons and daughters of presidents, Congressmen/women or government agents. A codicil to this law is the Leo Provision, named after characters from Smash and Designated Survivor, stating that if you're intending to name your teenage character "Leo," that character really should be written out of the script entirely. (There are no opponents to this proposition. Vote Yes.)
The JonBenet Rule: Celebrating the anniversaries of gory child murders as a means of getting cheap ratings bumps even when you have virtually no additional information on the killings and no insight to help to grieve friends and families is just ghoulish, and if you're the 10th or 15th network to schedule your special commemorating the anniversary of a gory child murder…just don't. This rule merely requires that those who are thinking of exploiting a child murder for ratings sit down in a corner and contemplate their actions for at least 15 minutes. If, after 15 minutes, they feel comfortable with what they're doing…well, that's on them, I suppose. (There are no opponents to this proposition. Vote Yes.)
The Netflix Proliferation Rule: Netflix knows what we watch and how quickly we watch it, but there needs to be regulation on the dissemination of product. This proposition permits Netflix to continue to avoid releasing ratings in exchange for instituting a policy wherein no new series can be released until at least 51 percent of the viewers who started the previous series also finished it. (Opponents of the rule insist they've just been waiting for the right weekend to binge on the second season of Marco Polo, darn it.)
Statute of Makeup Limitations: Too many shows this fall, and in recent years, have been hampered by comically bad old-age makeup. Offenders have included Old Oliver Queen on Legends of Tomorrow, Old Esposito From Castle on This Is Us and Old Nearly Everybody on Frequency. [Game of Silence on NBC did the reverse and tried having the actors play themselves in flashbacks with very little backwards-aging makeup, and that was ridiculous as well.] The sad reality is that while writers are ready and eager to do shows that span generations, makeup artists are not ready to deliver on anything more than 10-ish years of aging. This rule will require that writers doing decade-spanning stories either make the span tight enough to be achieved by makeup or wide enough to require recasting. (Opponents of the limitations argue that Mandy Moore's makeup on This Is Us was close to adequate.)
Halloween TerrordinanceL This ordinance would outlaw the mandatory carpet bombing of holiday episodes on any particular network, be those episodes Halloween or Christmas or Passover. The proposal is a direct response to a week in which every ABC comedy did a Halloween episode, many of which came across as essentially identical. No matter how good the show — and Fresh Off the Boat and Speechless are both very good — somebody has to step in and say that families learning the true meaning of Halloween and going out trick-or-treating together well after traditional trick-or-treating hours makes for a [candy] corny episode of TV. The exception to this rule is Black-ish, which can do absolutely anything it wants to, as long as nobody ever makes the show go back to Disney World.
Portuguese rule in Angola ended in 1975, but separatists in one Angolan province want the former colonizers to return.
The Portuguese news agency Lusa reported Thursday that a separatist group in Angola's oil-rich Cabinda province wants Portugal to oversee a referendum there on the region's political future.
Militants of the Front for the Liberation of the Enclave of Cabinda have carried out kidnappings and other attacks over the years. They say the Cabinda enclave was never part of Angolan territory.
Governments in Portugal, a major trade partner of Angola, have not commented in recent years on the claims and demands of Cabindan separatists.
Lusa reports that the Angolan interior minister, Angelo da Veiga Tavares, said last month that the situation in Cabinda is calm despite "speculation" about alleged rebel operations.
PayPal has cut off payments to white supremacist groups associated with the “Unite the Right” rally in Charlottesville, Va., that turned deadly over the weekend, CBS News reported.
According to CBS, civil rights group Color of Change said that PayPal has severed the account belonging to Unity and Security for America, a group run by Charlottesville rally organizer Jason Kessler.

Kessler was
run off from his own press conference
after the rally by angry counterprotesters.
On Saturday, 21-year-old James Alex Fields Jr. was charged with second-degree murder after police say he plowed his car into another vehicle and a crowd of protesters. The crash killed a 32-year-old woman.
The Southern Poverty Law Center reported on Tuesday that Kessler and others associated with the rally have been using PayPal to fund their organizations.
A spokesman for PayPal confirmed that the company has suspended more than three dozen accounts associated with hate groups but would not comment on any specific account.
Franz Paasche, a vice president of corporate affairs at PayPal, wrote in a blog post Tuesday that the company has always been proactive in policing its site for hate groups.
“Regardless of the individual or organization in question, we work to ensure that our services are not used to accept payments or donations for activities that promote hate, violence or racial intolerance,” Paasche wrote. “This includes organizations that advocate racist views, such as the KKK, white supremacist groups or Nazi groups."
“If we become aware of a website or organization using our services that may violate our policies, our highly trained team of experts addresses each case individually and carefully evaluates the website itself, any associated organizations, and their adherence to our policy,” he continued. “Ultimately, this team of professionals makes a recommendation that leads to the final determination on our ability to maintain our relationship with the website's owner.”
Harare - Zimbabwe's Robert Mugabe says Donald Trump's Mexico wall "appears quite nasty" but the US president "might come up with better policies", state media reported on Sunday.
In excerpts of an interview to be broadcast to mark his 93rd birthday on Tuesday, Mugabe was largely unwilling to criticise Trump, though he did admit the US president was "radical".
Said Mugabe in quotes carried by the Sunday Mail: "I was surprised by his election but I didn't like Madam Clinton either."
He added: "I don't know whether the construction of the wall between America and Mexico is feasible... it appears quite nasty." Zimbabwe has its own experience of keep-out fences: Botswana erected one along the border in 2002, ostensibly to protect its cattle from foot-and-mouth. But many thought the wall was to keep out Zimbabwe migrants.
Mugabe said it was "arrogant" of former US president Barack Obama to extend sanctions on Zimbabwe before he left office in January.
Mugabe has been in power since independence in 1980 and plans to stand again in elections next year.
Building Trust, Or Danger? Debate Over Naming Officers After Shootings
Enlarge this image toggle caption Matt Rourke/AP Matt Rourke/AP
When his son was fatally shot by police last December, Terrell Tate-Skinner demanded to know who did it. Brandon Tate-Brown had been killed by Philadelphia police during a struggle following a routine traffic stop — and his father saw getting the names of the officers as the first step to justice.
Tate-Skinner and several dozen activists staged a rally outside the city's police headquarters after the shooting. At the protests, demonstrators took on the rallying cry: "Who killed Brandon Tate-Brown?"
The tension at that rally highlights a common dilemma facing officials in the wake of a tragedy: What information should be disclosed to the public, and what should remain secret? The question has given rise to a simmering debate between the city's police commissioner and rank-and-file officers.
After years of criticism that police investigations in Philadelphia were too opaque — including a critical Justice Department report earlier this year — Police Commissioner Charles Ramsey overturned the longstanding policy of withholding officers' names. The department now identifies officers three days after a shooting incident.
I don't think you can shoot someone and expect to remain anonymous.
"I don't think you can shoot someone and expect to remain anonymous," says Commissioner Ramsey. "And I do think that we have a responsibility as a police agency that work[s] for the people to provide that information, unless there are some extenuating circumstances."
The change had the backing of criminal justice activists and the U.S. Department of Justice.
But the leader of the city's influential police union, John McNesby, pushed back, calling the move "insane and absurd."
"It makes it a little bit more difficult today because you actually have to look over your shoulder," he says. "We have families, too. We're not asking for the world. We're asking for fairness."
We're not asking for the world. We're asking for fairness.
Speaking at an event packed wall-to-wall with police, McNesby laid out new legislation that would prevent cities across Pennsylvania from revealing the names of officers who fire their weapons, unless charges are filed.
Martina White, the state representative sponsoring the bill, says the identities of officers who use deadly force should be kept secret to protect police from harassment and possible attacks. And retired police officer Rich Costello was among those cheering in the police union hall when the proposed legislation was announced.
"It's extremely reasonable, and it's something that would be observed in the case of any other citizen in this country," Costello says. "Unfortunately, police are guilty until proven innocent. That's what this bill attempts to combat."

Brian Buchner, president of the National Association for Civilian Oversight of Law Enforcement, says releasing officer names builds public trust — but it's no panacea.
"It's not necessarily going to calm tensions where there is tension between the community and the police department, but it's information," he says. "You know: patterns of conduct, or decisions about that conduct, by the agency itself.
In most states, police departments aren't required by state law to divulge officers' names after a deadly interaction. But Buchner says activists in many places are fighting to make departments be more upfront about what officer was involved.
Commissioner Ramsey, though, says if an officer feels in danger, the name won't be revealed. He says the public has a responsibility, too: "To not then use this to threaten people or cause harm to people. You know, you have to be concerned about that."
He adds: "But I think that it doesn't outweigh the public's need to really have that information."
The Pennsylvania bill keeping police names anonymous has the support of nearly a fourth of the state House of Representatives.
Ramsey says if the bill passes, he'll call on Gov. Tom Wolf to veto it.
Sorry Libs: Law Already Says Trump Can Build Great Border Wall
Sorry Open Border Elites…
The law already says trump can build in Beautiful US-Mexico Border Wall!
Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach met with Donald Trump in late November. A mainstream media photographer caught the moment.
Kobach is an expert on border security and legal immigration.
The photographer also caught a piece of paper outlining a potential Trump immigration reform agenda.
Reporters zoomed in on the paper and this is what they saw.
The Kobach notes include a 1,989 Trump wall in addition to the 386 miles of existing wall.
And the law already says Trump can build his beautiful border wall.
The Washington Examiner reported:
There's no shortage of people telling Donald Trump he can't build a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border. And maybe, in the end, he won't do it. But at the moment Trump takes office, he will have the legal authority and the money he needs to get started on the wall. Yes, there will be obstacles — what's the over/under on the number of lawsuits that will be filed trying to stop it? — but the fact is, the law is already in place that will allow Trump to go forward. As in other areas of immigration enforcement, Trump will be able to effect radical change simply by following the law. In this case, it is the Secure Fence Act, passed in 2006 with bipartisan support — 283 votes in the House and 80 in the Senate, including then-Sens. Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton. The law ordered the Secretary of Homeland Security, within 18 months of passage, to “take all actions the secretary determines necessary and appropriate to achieve and maintain operational control over the entire international land and maritime borders of the United States.” Specifically, the law called for the usual mix of high-tech sensors, cameras, border checkpoints, vehicle barriers and other measures along the U.S.-Mexico border. And then it ordered Homeland Security to “provide for [at]* least 2 layers of reinforced fencing” and “the installation of additional physical barriers” for hundreds of miles on the southern border.
Move over Tesla, this is the Toroidion. It's Finnish. No one knows how to pronounce it, so don't worry about that. All you need to know is that it's very pretty and — oh yeah, it's electric. In fact, it's described as a megawatt supercar – that's right, a supercar. It's full name is Toroidion 1MW Supercar and it is the result of a four year effort by Pasi Pennanen, a former designer for Jaguar and Zagato.
The concept car is street legal and was designed and built entirely in Finland. Technical details have not been fully released but Toroidion does say that each wheel is directly connected to its own electric motor – a 200 kilowatt unit for the front and 300 kilowatt units for the rear wheels. This adds up to a one megawatt motor – or, 1,341 horsepower.

Although the company doesn't give out a lot of details yet, particularly about the charging set-up, they do say that the battery will be swappable and as “easily replaced in the pit-lane as in the home garage.” Hmmm. And while there is not yet any idea of when the car will be available or how much it will cost, the company does say that it will keep us posted via the website. “There is no such thing as ‘it can't be done,'” Pennanen said. “I believe in pushing the boundaries in product development and design.”

NEW YORK (By By Clare Baldwin and Jonathan Stempel)
After piloting the No. 2 U.S. bank through the financial crisis relatively unscathed, JPMorgan Chase & Co Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon is now being extremely well rewarded.
Dimon's total compensation jumped nearly 1,500 percent to $20.8 million in 2010 from $1.3 million a year earlier, based on the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's compensation formula, a regulatory filing showed.
Dimon did even better in terms of the value of money and shares actually received: his salary, bonus and stock and options from grants made largely in previous years that were actually exercised in 2010 were worth around $42 million.
By way of comparison, real median U.S. household income was just $49,777 in 2009, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.
Large pay packages for bankers who oversaw transactions that brought the world economy to the brink of collapse in 2008 have become a flash point for investors.
Anger has eased, but banker pay remains a sensitive issue, especially toward lenders that took taxpayer bailout money.
Many analysts view JPMorgan as the healthiest of the largest U.S. commercial banks, having skirted the worst of the credit losses that hurt many rivals including Bank of America Corp and Citigroup Inc.
They credit the 55-year-old Dimon, who became chief executive on December 31, 2005, for having enabled JPMorgan to quickly repay its $25 billion of bailout money.
JPMorgan is also one of the first big banks to raise its dividend after passing a second Federal Reserve "stress" test.
However, Dimon has criticized regulatory reforms by the Obama administration, saying they could crimp growth.
In his annual shareholder letter posted on the bank's website, Dimon said JPMorgan could earn $22 billion to $24 billion in a "more normal" environment, up from $17.4 billion in 2010.
He said profit has fallen short because mortgage losses have been "extraordinarily high," at $4 billion a year and that such losses will remain "elevated" for a while.
THREE YEARS TO SELL HOME
Dimon's 2010 salary remained at $1 million. He was also awarded a $5 million bonus, nearly $8 million in stock awards and $6.2 million in option awards, according to the SEC's compensation formula.
His 2010 compensation also included $579,624 worth of perks, including $421,458 of "moving expenses," $95,293 to use company aircraft and $45,730 for personal automobile use. Most of the rest went toward home security.
Like many Americans who have had trouble selling their homes, Dimon did too. The moving expenses relate to the sale in 2010 of Dimon's Chicago-area home, in which he had lived while heading Bank One Corp that was sold to JPMorgan in 2004.
Dimon put the home up for sale in 2007 when his family moved to New York.
Dimon's total compensation in 2010 fell short of the $35.8 million he was awarded in 2008, according to the SEC formula.
Goldman Sachs Group Inc Chief Executive Lloyd Blankfein saw compensation jump to $14.1 million in 2010 from $1 million, another regulatory filing shows.
Other bank CEOs had lower compensation in 2010. Wells Fargo & Co's John Stumpf saw compensation fall to $19 million from $21.3 million. Bank of America's Brian Moynihan saw compensation fall 70 percent to about $1.9 million, although in early 2011 he got a $9.1 million bonus.
Citigroup CEO Vikram Pandit's compensation was $1 in 2010, but his salary alone has risen to $1.75 million in 2011.

First, the good news: real estate site Trulia reports that new low-income housing in San Francisco doesn't seem to negatively affect neighboring property values.
The site identified 90 projects in the city built between 1996 and 2006 that qualified for affordable housing tax credits.
Then, using data drawn from its own hosted listings, it compared the estimated values of homes within 2,000 feet of the affordable site to the value of homes further away in the same neighborhood.
And what they discovered was not much at all. “There is no statistically significant difference in price per square foot” one way or the other, according to the report, released today.
Which is good, because some people will need convincing.In 2007, just as the window closed on the studied time period, California realtors on Trulia's own Q&A page were debating this very same question.
A few agreed that didn't make much difference at all. Others said “it depends,” with too many variables involved to make a broad diagnosis.
Others were more blunt. For example: “Overall, it makes properties less attractive,” an Orange County agent replied.
“Of course it does,” one Bay Area realtor added. “Steer clear of these areas.”
“No one wants [low-income projects] near their homes,” another insisted.
Tough crowd.
But in 2015, Stanford found that some affordable housing projects actually raised property values overall, because the addition of new residents, new housing stock, and quality design improved the neighborhood overall.
A study of studies by the DC-based nonprofit National Housing Conference found that, across a dozen studies conducted between 1993 and 2006, no one ever observed significant depression of home values.
And in a similar study roundup earlier this year, the National Association of Realtors agreed, calling such concerns “a myth” but noting that many “continue to believe it.”
Those findings may be contingent where such projects are likely to appear, though.
Arizona State University in 2008 pointed out that it was “more likely” that BMR housing would cut home values when it was located in “low-poverty, stable neighborhoods.”
And why is that? Brace yourselves, because the answer may be uncomfortable.
A Texas A&M paper from 2015 (which dubbed research on this topic “inconsistent” overall) found that affordable development can run into trouble when it antagonizes people's prejudices.
If neighbors are convinced that the new housing is going to hurt the neighborhood, they might leave, and that might drive down demand.
Which of course would mean that the problem is not the new residents, but some of the old ones, and their assumptions about low-income housing. Awkward.
Well, at least the data is mostly encouraging. Even if the why behind it leaves something to be desired.

Washington (CNN) - President Barack Obama continued what's become an annual post-Thanksgiving tradition by stopping at a bookstore for Small Business Saturday.
With his two daughters alongside, the President went to Politics and Prose in Washington to pick up a few books, telling reporters he bought a "long list" of titles for every age group, including his own. (Read the full list below)
Follow @politicalticker Follow @KilloughCNN
The President chatted at length with several customers, while his daughters, Sasha and Malia, browsed.
He went to the cashier to make his purchase after about 20 minutes. As he left the shop, the President wished everyone a "great holiday," and customers applauded.
Started by two people in 1984, Politics and Prose has grown to a staff of 50 employees and is known as a popular spot for book discussions and readings, with daily visits by authors.
First lady Michelle Obama, who was not with the family Saturday, held a book signing at Politics and Prose in May to promote “American Grown,” a book about the White House garden and her campaign against obesity.
Last year, the Obamas shopped at a different bookstore - One More Page Books - in the Washington suburb of Arlington, Virginia.
Small Business Saturday is a tradition started by American Express in 2010.
In 2011, they went to Kramerbooks and Afterwords Café in Washington.
List of books purchased by Obama, according to the White House:
“Half Brother” by Kenneth Oppel
“Heart of a Samurai” by Margi Preus
“Flora and Ulysses” by Kate DiCamillo
“Jinx” by Sage Blackwood
“Lulu and the Brontosaurus” by Judith Viorst and Lane Smith
“Ottoline and the Yellow Cat” by Chris Riddell
“Moonday” by Adam Rex
“Journey” by Aaron Becker
“The Lowland” by Jhumpa Lahiri
“Red Sparrow” by Jason Matthews
“Harold and the Purple Crayon” by Crockett Johnson
“A Constellation of Vital Phenomena” by Anthony Marra
“The Sports Gene: Inside the Science of Extraordinary Athletic Performance” by David Epstein
“Collision Low Crossers: A Year Inside the Turbulent World of NFL Football” by Nicholas Dawidoff
“Ballad of the Sad Cafe: And Other Stories” by Carson McCullers
“My Antonia” by Willa Cather
“Ragtime” By E.L. Doctorow
“The Kite Runner” by Khaled Hosseini
“Buddha in the Attic” by Julie Otsuka
“All That Is” by James Salter
“Wild: From Lost to Found On the Pacific Crest Trail” by Cheryl Strayed
Obama also encouraged Americans to take part in Small Business Saturday via Twitter on Saturday.

Attorney General Eric Holder, Commerce Secretary Penny Pritzker, Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius, and other members of the President's Cabinet also promoted shopping at locally-owned stores. The Small Business Administration's chief post, a Cabinet-level position, is currently held by an acting administrator.

BRADENTON, Fla. – When Toronto FC takes the field on Saturday night in its first MLS Cup Final, one of the players who could help the club to success in the future will be watching from about 1,500 miles south of BMO Field.
A member of the U.S. U17 Residency Program at IMG Academy in Bradenton, Fla., 16-year-old Ayo Akinola is definitely eager to see his senior teammates raise the cup for the first time.
“We've really worked hard for this,” he said on Friday night following the U17 side's 3-0 victory against the IMG Academy U17/18 team as part of a 2016 Super Y League North American Finals Showcase. “I'm going to watch the game tomorrow, so I really hope my team does win, but there's a lot of progression in what we're doing, and I hope it continues.”
Akinola's progression in 2016 has made him one to watch within the U.S. Youth National Team program and within the USL. Born in Detroit before his family moved to Brampton, Ont. prior to his first birthday, Akinola capped a fine year last week with four goals as the U.S. went a perfect 3-0-0 in the 2016 Nike Friendlies.
[Edit 18/7: To be super clear: Everyone who bought the game from our site before July 17th is still entitled to their key, and can still get it from the automated key distributor. This change only affects new purchases made in the future. This story has gotten a weirdly huge amount of press, but it's a mountain from a molehill. Only about 85 keys were cancelled in total – less than 0.1% of the total being distributed.]
If you bought before today, you can still get a key. However, I've been forced to stop offering Steam keys for those who buy today and in the future. We've been getting hammered by fraudsters who are obviously more experienced at this than I. Shutting it down for now is the only way to avoid thousands of dollars in chargeback fees and lost sales. It's time to take a breather, because I can't fight this ‘live'.
The game is, of course, for sale on Steam if you want a Steam copy. Buying from our site will give DRM-free copies as before, but no Steam key.
All the stolen keys are being cancelled, and should be deactivated before they can be sold (or soon after, depending on how fast Valve does it). The funds they were stolen with are being returned to their rightful owners. If you don't want to get ripped off by fraudsters, be sure to buy direct from Steam.
If you bought direct from us before July 17 and find your key cancelled, it may be due to a separate glitch we had, entirely unrelated to fraud. This affected only a few dozen people. You should be able to get a new key immediately from the Steam key giver, and continue playing where you left off. The Support page has a bit more info about this.

By the end of this year, health conscious Hyderabadis will have one more reason to smile. A 30-km long cycle track, being laid in Cyberabad by the Andhra Pradesh Industrial Infrastructure Corporation Limited (APIIC) and the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC), will be completed by this year-end.
APIIC managing director Jayesh Ranjan, speaking at the launch of the fifth Freedom Ride-2013, a corporate cycling competition here Friday, said 10 cycle stations will be built and employees working in the area can pick up a cycle from one of them to commute to their place of work for a fixed amount every month.
The corporate cycling competition will be held on August 15 at the Gachibowli stadium and is being organised by The Atlanta Foundation (TAF), a not-for-profit organisation.
Jayesh Ranjan said the event, supported by the APIIC, is intended to encourage cycling among people. The organisers announced that participants have to cycle 66 km to celebrate India's 66th Independence Day.
Deenanath Harapanahalli, founder of TAF, said a part of the money collected through registration fee for the competition will be used to provide education to underprivileged students through educational programs conducted at four government schools adopted by TAF.
Donations generated through the competition will be collected by TAF's charity partner ‘United Way of Hyderabad' which will be used to fund activities in rainbow schools.
Close to 5,300 people have already registered for the competition. Those interested can register till August 13 by paying `1250. The freedom ride will be flagged off at 7 a.m. on August 15.
Tanvie is a Delhi girl who has played for big clubs like Tottenham Hotspurs and Fulham. She was born in Punjab and brought up in New Delhi. Tanvie started playing Football at the very young age. She has the natural connection with this beautiful game known as “Football”.
Tanvie started playing football at the age of 8 with boys. At the age of 12, she started playing competitive football with girls. Tanvie studied in a Vasant Valley school in Delhi and at that moment only this school was having girls football team. She then played in different categories like under-15 and under-17. Everything was going fine for her like a fine silk but in the summer of 2008, she suffered the biggest setback of her life. In 2008 she was called up for Indian football team under-19. She was there in a camp for 1 month but later she was not allowed to play football for India as she was holding the British passport.
But like Joel Osteen said, “Use your setback as a setup for your comeback”. The same was in the case of Tanvie, she left India and traveled to the UK. After graduating from Delhi's prestigious Jesus and Mary College in 2011, she left to pursue Masters from the University of Exeter. This hitch doesn't stop Tanvie in becoming a Professional Footballer. And in this university, she got the taste of the most difficult league i.e English premier league. Tanvie used to be the captain of school and college team of her. But here she was not even selected to the 1st team of university football team. She was selected for the second team of the university football. After some good performance for the second team, she was selected to the first team. After completing her master she came back to India.
In India, she was still connected to this game. Now she worked hard on her physicality as in England if you are technically sound you need to be physically strong as well to become a Professional Footballer. The struggle is woven into the fabrics of Tanvie's life but this hasn't stopped Tanvie in becoming a Professional footballer. Her hard work was paid off in 2013.
In 2013, she was selected to play football for Tottenham Hotspur. In her heydeys, she plays for Tottenham reserve team and Tottenham second team. She never got a chance to play for Spurs A team. After 2 years at Spurs in 2015, she made a move to Fulham. When she tried for Fulham at first they put Tanvie in the reserve team. After some good performance, she was transferred to 1st team. At Spurs, she used to play as a winger but at Fulham, she was the Main Striker. Playing for the first team of Fulham is the favourite memory of this Delhi Girl in England.
For a Delhi girl to play in England for a club like Spurs and Fulham is a big achievement. Just imagine a girl of this calibre and quality playing for India. After 3 successful years in England in 2016, she came back to India. What she is doing right now is raising funds for 400 underprivileged girls to play Football. Tanvie was meant to play for FC Pune City in Indian Women's League but as she was holding British passport she is not allowed. Nearly every day she goes to Passport office so that they can allow her to play football in this league or in future for India. She can unlock a defence with a pass and she can sprint beyond the defensive line to stretch with her blistering speed but only if she is given a chance.
“I wanted to come back to India because this is my country I wanted to always make a difference over here” – Tanvie Hans
Indian Government what else do you want? She is the pure definition of “True Indian”. One who left England for the sake of developing Football in India. One who gave up the lifestyle of England just to help Indian girls progressing in Football. If money was the case for her she might have lived in England. But no she is true Indian who came back to her motherland. The way the ocean refuses to stop kissing the shoreline, no matter how many times it's spent away. In the same way, Tanvie is just not giving up on this dream of wearing Blue jersey of India one day.
We on behalf of LifeHacks salute Tanvie Hans for trying that much hard in getting Indian Citizenship. And we urge or plead the Government of India to grant Tanvie Indian Citizenship as soon as possible.
Just bring dual citizenship here in India or make an exception for a sportsperson because we are losing talents like her.

Watching William Hague doing his avuncular routine in the Commons on Monday, I was reminded of the way establishment figures in the 1950s used to reassure hoi polloi that they had nothing to worry about. Everything was in order. The Right Chaps were in charge. Citizens who had done nothing wrong, declared Uncle Hague, had nothing to fear from comprehensive surveillance.
Oh yeah? As Stephen Fry observed in an exasperated tweet: "William Hague's view seems to be 'we can hide a camera & bug in your room & if you've got nothing to hide, what's the worry?' Hell's teeth!"
Hell's teeth indeed. I can think of thousands of people who have nothing to hide, but who would have good reasons to worry about intrusive surveillance. Journalists seeking to protect their sources, for example; NHS whistleblowers; people seeking online help for personal psychological torments; frightened teenagers seeking advice on contraception or abortion; estranged wives of abusive husbands; asylum seekers and dissident refugees; and so on.
In a way, Hague's smug, patronising tone was the least troubling aspect of the NSA/GCHQ story. More worrying was the unexplained contradiction between claims in the Prism PowerPoint slides that the NSA routinely collects data from Microsoft, Google, Yahoo, PalTalk, YouTube, Skype, AOL and Apple, and the companies' frantic denials that this was the case. (Interestingly, Facebook, Amazon and Twitter aren't on the list – yet.) The named companies have all claimed that while they do provide user data in response to government requests, they do so only on a case-by-case basis and using tools such as secure virtual dropboxes or encrypted file transfers.
One of the slides in the presentation is entitled "Prism collection details" (emphasis added). It describes the companies as "current providers" (implying voluntary or involuntary compliance) and informs its audience about "what will you receive in collection (surveillance and stored comms)?", which "varies by provider".
There are various ways of reading this. One is that Prism does indeed have direct access to the internet companies' servers because, as one of the NSA bigwigs famously observed: "If you're looking for a needle in a haystack, then you need the haystack" and it now has the technology to get it. Another reading is that Prism merely automates the serving of legally authorised writs on the internet companies. But whatever the explanation, someone is being economic with the actualité, as Alan Clark once said.
Let us suppose, for a moment, that it's the companies that are the prime economisers in this context. If it is indeed the case that the NSA has logon-type access to their servers, what does that mean for anyone who is uncomfortable about this? Simple: one shouldn't entrust one's personal communications to any of them. That means: no Microsoft cloud services, no Google or Bing searches, no Google Docs, no Gmail, Yahoo mail or Hotmail; no Skype calls; no YouTube or Vimeo videos; no Flickr or Picasa; no Facebook or Twitter. And, of course, no iPhone or iPad use.
Why? Because all these services and/or devices rely on cloud services hosted in the US, which – we must assume – are routinely hoovered by the NSA for indefinite storage in the colossal server farm the agency has been constructing in Utah.
Over the last week, I have had various conversations with friends, colleagues and acquaintances about Prismgate. Many – though not all – confessed to feeling uneasy about what it might mean for privacy and/or liberal democracy. Some were sceptical that the NSA and its overseas franchises such as GCHQ actually possess the technical capability to "collect the haystack". All were adamant, however, that they don't want to live in a National Security state.
But when I raised Tim Wu's recommendation that users should therefore boycott Google and co, the atmosphere changed. The idea of not using Google for search seems unthinkable to most people. My respondents could live without Google Docs, but most thought that webmail was essential. Older people might be able to live without YouTube, but nobody under the age of 25 could. For many, Skype has become a personal lifeline for keeping in touch with distant friends and family members. iPhone and iPad users were appalled at the idea of having to give up their toys. And one person declared that he would sooner shoot himself than go back to using Microsoft Windows.
The moral of this? Simple: we're screwed either way. We're so hooked on the services provided by Google et al that we can't contemplate boycotting them, whether or not they're collaborating with the Feds. We walked cheerfully into the trap, folks. All that remains now is to live with the consequences.
It's that time everybody: Nexus season. While the last substantive pieces of Nexus information we could share popped up nearly two months ago, we've finally received some tidbits about the device specifications we can give you today. Now, let's go through the AP rumor song and dance.
Disclaimer: No matter the confidence level, there's always a chance product updates, features, and some or all details will be changed or cancelled altogether. As with all rumors, nothing is 100% until it's officially announced. : No matter the confidence level, there's always a chance product updates, features, and some or all details will be changed or cancelled altogether. As with all rumors, nothing is 100% until it's officially announced. We do not have possession of any APKs we can distribute or unreleased devices, so please don't ask for them.
Confidence level
We rate this rumor a 9 out of 10 confidence level (revised to a 9 post-Marlin leak). At this time, we lack strong corroborating evidence for the specifications of the upcoming Nexus phone - codename Sailfish (also known as "S1"), one of two devices. However, the source that has provided this information to us has proven trustworthy in the past, and we feel confident enough to publish this information based on what we have been given.
That said, we are subtracting points on this occasion because of the lack of a secondary source to confirm the information, as well as a lack of primary sources we are able to share today.
The evidence
Unfortunately, we are not able to share direct evidence from our sources, both due to the sensitive nature of that evidence and the way in which it was relayed to us. Suffice it to say, we would not publish this information if we did not feel confident in the quality of that source. Here is what we know about one of two Nexus phones, codenamed "Sailfish."
Manufactured by HTC
5" 1080p display (~440PPI) AMOLED (revised per Marlin leak)
Quad-core 2.0GHz 64-bit processor (model unknown)
4GB RAM
2770mAh battery
32GB storage (unknown if multiple models will be available, or even if this is the base storage level)
12MP rear camera, 8MP front
Rear-mounted fingerprint scanner
USB-C port (bottom)
Bottom-firing speaker or speakers (unknown if dual)
Top-mounted headphone jack
Bluetooth 4.2
The 5" display has been previously rumored - codenames for the Sailfish and Marlin early on were alleged to be T50 and T55, respectively, and we had an earlier source months back tell us that the smaller of the two phones would use a 5" display. The rest, though, is largely down to our trust of this source.
But this is what we have for now - at this time, we aren't able to confirm anything about pricing, release date, different storage/RAM configurations (or if there are any), or really anything aside from what I've told you above. We don't even know what it will be called, or if HTC's brand will be featured on the device or in marketing for the handset.
Final thoughts
The specifications provided to us by our source seem exceptionally believable. Keeping the smaller, more down-market Nexus of the two at 1080p on the display panel makes sense, and also reduces power consumption. As for everything else, well: we can hope that 32GB is now the base level storage for the introductory level Nexus phone, but we're not able to confirm that at this time - it's entirely possible a 16GB model may exist, we just don't know yet.
We will work to give you more information about the upcoming Nexus devices as we are able to get it. Until then, let the real #NexusHype begin.

The role of microbial biomass (bacteria and fungi) in the soil is significant. Microbes help to decompose organic matter in the soil, recycle nutrients and to help the formation of soil aggregates. These activities increase the mineralisation and retention of elements in the soil required for plant growth. What effect returning crop residues to the soil in combination with different fertiliser use have on microbial biomass is therefore important for both crop health and to avoiding overuse of fertilisers and related financial and environmental consequences.
A study in the Journal of Agricultural Science looked at the effects of 30 years of returning maize to an experimental plot at the Jilin Agricultural University in combination with a variety of fertiliser treatments on the amount and composition of the microorganisms in the soil.
Using a split-plot design, the researchers had 3 residue return treatments of 0, 2.5 and 5 thousand kilograms of residue per hectare per year. Each plot treatment was repeated in triplicate and was subdivided into 4 square metre subplots. Each subplot was randomly treated with either no fertiliser, nitrogen only, potassium only, phosphorus only or with the various combinations of two or more of those fertilisers.
The soil was a clay loam soil and the subplots were divided by concrete barriers that were buried to a depth of 2 metres. On each plot a target of 60,000 maize plants were grown per hectare and after harvest the residues were dried, cut and incorporated back into the soil to a depth of 20cm at the various rates. On 8 May 2014, after 30 years of the soil be subjected to the various treatments, 4 soil sample cores were taken from each plot for analysis.
The hypothesis of the study were that:
fertilisation would lead to significant changes in soil microbial communities to differing degrees dependent on the amount of maize residues also returned to the soil; and the soil microbial communities would be due to treatment-induced changes in the properties of the soil.
Results
Given the 24 different soil treatments there are a large number of statistically significant results reported on. Some of the more interesting or useful results were:
All fertiliser treatments resulted in a lowering of the soil pH. Plots with residue returned at 5000kg/ha had a significantly lower pH than the other residue treatments;
Fertilisation had no effect on organic carbon content of soils under control and 5,000kg/ha residue returns but a significant effect was seen when fertiliser was combined with 2,500kg/ha residue returns. Plots with residue return had higher organic carbon carbon than plots with none;
Fertilisers had differing effects on total nitrogen content depending on residue return but the more crop residues that were returned the higher the total N observed;
The carbon-to-nitrogen ratios were highest in plots without residue return and decreased as residue return increased;
Residue return resulted in a significant increase in available nitrogen and potassium, but not phosphorus.
A 5,000 kg/ha residue return resulted in a higher total and ratio of soil microbial groups than both the other residue treatments but the ratio of fungi to bacteria was reduced;
Fertiliser effect on soil microbes depended on the crop residue amount for a significant effect to be observed;
Residue return significantly effected fungi and bacteria and had an indirect effect on bacteria due to an increase on the soil fertility while fertiliser effected bacteria in the soil as a result of the decrease in pH;
Microbial community composition of plots with 5,000kg/ha returned were significantly different from the other residue treatments.
Figure from article. Effect of residue return amount and mineral fertiliser application on microbial biomass.
Discussion
The main point raised by the researchers in the discussion was that there seems to be a threshold over which the rate of residue return will have a significant effect on microbial biomass, as can be seen in figure 1 (a) above. The biomass amounts between the control and 2,500kg/ha residue return treatment show no significant effect but a visible effect can be seen when the 5,000kg/ha of residue was returned. Whilst it has been previously explained that an increase in residue causes an increase in organic carbon, in turn increasing biomass, in this experiment the increase in residue amount and increase in biomass did not correlate with the changes in organic carbon amounts in the soil.
If such a threshold is confirmed, knowing this threshold under different soil types, different crop types and environmental conditions could be an important piece of knowledge to farmers in adjusting their fertiliser rates for a given rate of residue return.
Conclusion
Soil nutrient composition is effected by many factors. Tillage, crop rotation, soil type and texture are just a few of these. Understanding how two agronomic treatments such as residue retention and fertiliser will interact and adjusting application rates of the fertiliser will certainly assist food production. Whilst there is further research required to confirm the threshold observed in this study, whether different crops have different effects and whether crop rotations alter the impact are just a few. But this study can be used to guide farmers and agronomists in broadly understanding the effect of residue retention.

Fox News host Steve Doocy (screen grab)
Fox News host Steve Doocy suggested on Monday that it was dangerous for young children to learn about sexual diversity because he said that kindergartners shouldn't be exposed to information about “transsexuals” and “stuff that's gross.”
In a report published last week, PBS Newshour said that a Dutch system of teaching “sexuality education” to 4-year-old students was making its way to the U.S. According to the report, the training is about having “open, honest conversations about love and relationships” instead of explicitly teaching about sex. Core principles of the Dutch class included sexual diversity and sexual assertiveness lessons that encourage respect for others and teach skills to protect against abuse.
On Monday, Doocy spoke to parenting blogger Cherie Corso, and was shocked to find out that she agreed with teaching the Dutch sexuality class to children.
“When you were 4 years old, you didn't have the Internet, you didn't have the Web, you weren't bombarded by these sexually explicit messages like the kids are today,” Corso told Doocy. “The earlier we start teaching kids about sexuality and being responsible for your body, there is lower teen birth rates, there are lower amounts of sexual abuse because they can identify it sooner.”
“Not at age 4! And not in school!” conservative former teacher Whitney Neal shot back. “A parent has the right to decide when and how they want to discuss these issues with their child.”
Neal said that it was just “another example” of public schools “trying to take the responsibility for these things away from the parent.”
Corso argued, however, that children were “bombarded with so much information” that they needed “guided” training in schools.
“I just had to explain to my daughter what transsexual was based on all this information that was out there,” Corso added. “She's 11 years old and the children are saying when they're younger, ‘Yeah, I like this one. Maybe I'm gay, maybe I'm not.' Children say crazy things and I think we need a group of people to help them and guide them through.”
“At age 11, a lot of kids have questions because they have smartphones and stuff like that,” Doocy opined. “But you would think at age 4, that most parents would not allow kids to be on the Internet to fish around for stuff that's gross.”
“Exactly, there's a big difference between a 4 year old and an 11 year old,” Neal agreed, adding that she was appalled that the Dutch were teaching kids to label genitalia on a diagram of the human body.
“I think there are a lot of things that are brought to light by having young children do that that they're just not prepared for,” Neal complained. “Maybe that is something an 11-year-old can handle, but definitely not my kindergartner.”
“PBS going from Big Bird to, well, you know,” Doocy concluded.
Watch the video below from Fox News, broadcast June 1, 2015.
Head down to Koln's training ground, tucked away in leafy surroundings in the south west of the city, and it's easy to see why goalkeeper Timo Horn - a local lad and life-long fan of the club - is so beloved by the supporters.
That the majority of training sessions are open encourages Koln fans to come and watch, with plenty lining up for autographs and selfies after. A footballer obliging in this regard, as Horn does, is by no means groundbreaking but having seen him even record birthday messages over WhatsApp for fans when asked, the 24-year-old goalkeeper goes above and beyond what's required.
“I know what it was like as a young kid in Koln to come here to watch training and try and collect as many autographs as I could from the players at the time,” says Horn, who first joined the club at the age of nine.

“I always found it hard to accept when the players would just walk past me and pay me no attention, especially when I was looking at them as role models.”
Along with his dad Stefan, Horn went to every Koln home game. His family still have two season tickets for the south stand at the RheinEnergieStadion. He knows then how, before he was born, the club used to regularly compete for the Bundesliga title and qualify for Europe.
That hasn't been the case during Horn's time as a supporter or a player. Prior to qualifying in May, 1992 was the last time Koln played in the Europa League, then the UEFA Cup, but he still has fond memories as a supporter.
He recalls being one of the fans who raced onto the pitch in 2008 when Koln were promoted after a 2-0 win against Jürgen Klopp's Mainz, one of five promotions in the last 20 years. Relegation however preceded each of them. Horn can recall three of them as a fan but for the most recent one in 2012, he was an unused substitute.
A painful experience for Horn the fan but for Horn the player, it was just the chance he needed. The following season he became the first-choice goalkeeper at the age of 19. Koln would still average a crowd of over 40,000 even then in the 2. Bundesliga. You can understand why he once described the pressure as immense.
As they prepared for yet another second-tier campaign, Arsenal came over to play a friendly. Looking back Horn says: “It was hard to imagine that we'd ever play against Arsenal in a competitive fixture.”
“To be taking them on in the Europa League a few years later … we could never have predicted that.”
This was the game Horn wanted. On the day of the Europa League draw, he talked about Arsenal being his favourite English club and how he'd always been a little bit of a fan when he was younger.
“I've always thought of Arsene Wenger as a fantastic manager,” says Horn.
“I like the football culture in England and Arsenal just had something in my view that the other teams didn't have. I've always enjoyed the style of football they try to employ even if they haven't won that many titles.”
Arsenal's below par start to the season has not affected Horn's great respect for Arsene Wenger either.
“People forget quite quickly the times gone by and the years where he made a real impact on the club to get them where they are today, which is why I don't quite understand the protests.”
He picks out Olivier Giroud as “a player I admire in terms of his style of play” but admits he's never owned an Arsenal shirt. “I was always a Koln fan first and foremost,” he says, smiling.
As a result, the club's promotion back to the Bundesliga in 2014 was that little bit sweeter. This time he wasn't running onto the pitch as a fan. He was already on it as a player and, as he remains today, an important one.
In June, his fellow Bundesliga players voted him as the best goalkeeper in the division behind Manuel Neuer. Prominent German football magazine 11Freunde called Horn “the symbol of Koln's upswing” last season whilst his current coach, Peter Stöger, singled him out for his consistency before the start of the current campaign.
“Timo has only been to blame for two or three goals since I came to Koln [in 2013],” said Stöger, the architect of the club's rise since joining from Austria Vienna. Horn is equally complimentary of the “very calm” Stöger.
“I don't think there are many head coaches that would act the same in the supermarket as they do in front of the media, which is never easy for a head coach. He always finds the appropriate words and, for a club like this, it's important to have a coach like him.”
Horn continues: “When he joined the club he told us straight away that he doesn't want to be one of those coaches that when he comes in the dressing room we all feel like we have to stop talking. Instead he wanted to get involved in our conversations and have a very relaxed approach to exerting his authority.”
That was shown as recently as April when Stöger bumped into midfielder Konstantin Rausch at a restaurant in the city. So Stöger joined Rausch for dinner and the pair ended up being there for another two hours. His commitment to wanting to improve each of his players is clear but he didn't feel he'd managed to do so when another midfielder Daniel Halfar left the club in 2015. Stöger sent him a text apologising for not having been able to get the most out of him during his time at the club.
The small personal touches are evident when you see Stöger with the local press. You'll see him greet each of the journalists with a handshake and from time to time he'll share a soft drink with them after a press conference too.
His level-headed approach matches that of sporting director Jörg Schmadtke who has ably assisted Stöger with smart work in the transfer market despite Koln's budget being in the bottom half of the Bundesliga. Europa League qualification was the culmination of that.
“I don't think we finished fifth last season based on how much individual talent we have,” says Horn.
“Of course, we've got players like [Jonas] Hector or, last season, [Anthony] Modeste that could definitely make a difference but overall it's the collective effort of the team and the team spirit that saw us turn games around last season.”
Modeste may have struggled with Blackburn in the Premier League but 25 goals for Koln last season led home fans to call him ‘Football God'. Yet a reported fee of £32m saw him leave for the Chinese Super League in the summer, with the club using that money to spend just shy of £15m on replacement Jhon Cordoba from Mainz.
Things haven't clicked for Cordoba and Koln yet domestically this season. Their 3-0 defeat to Augsburg on Saturday means they're bottom of the Bundesliga but despite being the only team yet to get a point this season, the excitement about European football coming back to the city remains.
Interest from other clubs will increase in Horn should he handle himself on the European stage as well as he does in the Bundesliga. When asked about the prospect of playing abroad, he said: “In principle the thought of moving to England is appealing but it's not something I'm thinking about right now.”
“I can't rule it out completely. I often had chances and offers to move to England as a youth player, but in my opinion the best goalkeeping education is here in Germany which is why I've always stayed. Of course, when you're more of a finished product as a goalkeeper and don't have as much room to develop further then it's certainly interesting prospect - but right now I'm incredibly happy here in Koln.”
He continues: “At the age of 15 or 16, Liverpool were very interested in me. But I didn't go there because I felt the goalkeeping schooling in Germany was much better and I had enough examples, for instance Ron-Robert Zieler who came back after a year [at Leicester], and that's why I stayed in Koln. It definitely wasn't the wrong decision!”
Even if he were to leave Koln, Horn would be back. He's still got those two season tickets in the south stand after all.

limited timeseems to be everywhere today. And while I would love to indulge and try this color and flavor-changing marvel out at Starbucks, it seems that it is not vegan as it comes. I think if you remove the blue drizzle and the whip it would be vegan, but without that sassy sour blue stuff, I mean, what's the point? But props to Starbucks for using vegetable-based colorings like spirulina and radish and sweet potato!But back to my problem. I am inside working all day at my desk and would love to sip on something magical. Well problem solved! This Copycat Unicorn Frapp is vegan, naturally colored with plants and actually has a whole bunch of good-for-you ingredients. So turn on some sparkly music and open the windows to let the spring air whip through your princess-y hair because it'stime...Includes a!..

But I love homemade coconut whip best!
The simple answer is: yes. The problem with some of the previous answers is that they seem to think that Gynocentrism and Patriarchy are mutually exclusive states of affairs, when in reality the opposite is true. In fact, i would postulate that the reason that the majority of human societies have historically been patriarchal is because such a societal structure logically follows from Gynocentrism.
In prehistoric times, the survival of our species depended on the ability of females to be able to give birth to and raise children without dying. Do to this, combined with the fact that our large brains require humans to have an unusually long gestation period and longer childhood than other types of primates, we value the lives of the females in a tribe more than those of the males. It was evolutionarily advantageous for risky endeavors to be undertaken mainly by the males of our species, as this allowed the females to birth and raise the young without putting themselves in harms way. This would help to ensure the survival of the tribe, as well as the species as a whole.
However, technology evolves much faster than biology, and we still retain these deeply rooted behaviors even though they are no longer useful. In the business world, the same sorts of male-dominated risky behaviors that at one time would have resulted in near certain death have themselves evolved into financial risks, which can now have huge payoffs for those undertaking such risks. This is probably why we see more rich men than women, but also more poor men as well. While I don't necessarily believe that we should be content with this state of affairs, I think it is important to know why things are the way they are if we have any hope of changing them. I find it funny that the Feminist movement and the Men's Rights movement are portrayed as being diametrically opposed, when in reality they are fighting the same fight; the main difference is that Feminists call it the fight againts Patriarchy while the MRM calls it the fight against Gynocentrism.
Some statistics:
97% of workplace fatalities are male.
99% of war casualties are male.

women are considered the default care giver in custody disputes.
women make up a majority of alimony recipients.
men make up over 30% of domestic abuse victims, yet receive 0% of the funding.
less than 1% of domestic abuse shelters are for men.
men are 3 times more likely to commit suicide.
most homeless people are male.

Condolence and support from heads of state across the globe poured in to France after Friday's terror attacks in Paris. China's president Xi Jinping told French president François Hollande by telephone that his country is ready to join France in combating terrorism.
But despite the kind words, China's real anti-terrorism focus seems to be within its own borders.
At the G20 summit in Turkey on Sunday (Nov. 15), China's foreign minister Wang Yi said the international community should cooperate with China to fight Uighur separatists in its far west territory of Xinjiang, state news agency Xinhua reported (link in Chinese). There should be no “double standards” in fighting terrorism, Wang said, and the United Nation should play a leading role to form a “united front” for it.
“China is also a victim of terrorism. The fight against the ‘East Turkestan Islamic Movement'… should become an important part of the international fight against terrorism,” Xinhua reported Wang saying.
China has expressed concerns about the rise of ISIL, fearing it will stir up unrest in Xinjiang, where some Muslim Uighurs seek an independent state called East Turkestan. State-backed media reports (link in Chinese) Uighur separatists are fleeing the country to join ISIL in Syria, Iraq, or its branches in Southeast Asia, though Beijing has said the situation isn't entirely clear.
In recent years, China has been home to dozens of terrorism attacks and violent clashes, which have spread from the northwest to the whole nation, as Quartz has reported. Chinese media often blames Uighur separatists, but other reports say Chinese authorities are brutally cracking down on the local community—in one incident killing dozens of protesters this year.
The international community remains skeptical, because independent reporting in the area is difficult. China's government has also long been criticized for its heavy-handed, draconian treatment of its largely Muslim Uighur population, including banning religious holidays like Ramadan, and making it illegal for women to wear burqas in some places.
The day after the Paris attacks, the state-backed People's Daily posted a rare article (link in Chinese) about what it said was a mission to root out terrorist militants in Xinjiang. A series of nine pictures showed a group of armed police, whose faces are blanked out, climbing and camping in mountainous areas, and getting ready to storm into a shabby house. (The original has been removed but here is a cached page.)

“France's Paris was hit by its worst terrorist attack in history, with hundreds dead and injured. On the other side of the world, police in China's Xinjiang, after 56 days of pursuing and attacking, carried out a full attack on the terrorists and got great results,” reads the text accompanying the pictures.
The content originated, it appears, from a post on the social media platform Sina Weibo (link in Chinese, registration required), in what seems to be the official account of the public security ministry. But that post, and re-posts that followed, have been deleted.
One picture shows a note that looks to be written by a member of the anti-terrorism team on the mission. It records when the battle was completed and when the bodies of terrorists were found, and also warns that anyone take violent anti-government actions will pay a price thanks to “the people's police and the people's army.”
Sina Weibo
It's unclear where and when the pictures were taken exactly. Chinese state media didn't reveal what the original terrorist attack was, or how many people were killed in the police force's retaliation.
After a briefing Sunday about the Paris attacks, China's police chief Guo Shengkun ordered more intelligence gathering and analysis, as well as patrols at key venues, according to the website of the public security ministry (link in Chinese).
Every entrepreneur or someone living the unconventional life goes through multiple projects. Our minds race with ideas and we keep writing them down, knowing that we are just panning for gold. With so many ideas, so many active projects, how do we know which projects to focus on, when to quit and when to push forward? I recently found a great method to weed through all of your current projects and decide on which ones to keep going with.
Nothing is worth doing that you cannot become the best in the world at. From programming to poker you should strive to be the best. No one wants the second best or top ten. They want THE best in the world and are willing to pay whatever price you see fit. Once you are the best, you dictate the the variables.
The Method
In order to get a hold on all of your projects, begin by writing them all down, even your hobbies. Once you have them written down there are two things you need to answer as either YES or No; a) CAN you become the best in the world at it and b) do you even WANT to become the best in the world at it? These are two very important questions that need to be answered! If you want to be an author, can become the best at it but simply do not want too, is it that important to you? Perhaps it would be best to focus on other things on your list.
Here is what I came up with as my list of projects:
1. Ruby on Rails Programmer: Yes/Yes
I know I have the ability to become the best in the world and I understand it may take one to two years and a lot of practice to get there. Being the best Ruby on Rails programmer in the world would be a very valuable asset for myself.
2. Personal Trainer: Yes/Maybe
I am currently getting certified as a personal trainer and have the ability and patients to become the best trainer in the world but I do not think it is necessary. I would obviously strive to be the best I can but would not focus on being the best in the eyes of the world.
3. Author/Writer: Yes/Yes
I eventually would like to write multiple books in my life and would like them to be well received in the world. In order for me to do that at the highest level possible, I need to be (In my mind) the best writer possible. When I say the best writer possible, I do not mean Shakespear but within the general scope of writing.
Once you have everything written down, and trust me, I have a lot more written down and the list is constantly growing, you are then ready for the next step.
This step is often painful for anyone because it forces you to choose one and drop the rest (for now…). When you spread yourself too thin you are not able to dedicate 100% of yourself. How do you expect to be the best in the world while only working at 20-50%, while others are working at 110%? The odds are not in your favor at all!
I hope choosing was not as hard for you as it is for me….
The Dip
At some point in every project you work on you will experience what is called “The Dip”. The Dip is when things get hard. Your initial motivation and excitement has gone and you are left with the potential risk of failure and embarrasement. At this point, most people quit. It is during this point your true dedication to a project is tested. If you truly believe in your work, you will push through The Dip and eventually succeed.
When you know you CAN and WANT to be the best in the world at something and dedicate 100% of yourself to doing so, you will see success and will push through The Dip with no problem.

Adam Szubin has served in both the Bush and Obama administrations and was asked to stay on by the Trump tesm. | AP Photo Obama Treasury official Senate GOP refused to confirm is among those Trump asked to stay on
Adam Szubin spent the past two years acting as the Treasury Department's undersecretary for terrorism and financial intelligence while Senate Republicans refused to confirm him and other Obama administration nominees.
On Thursday, the incoming Trump administration named Szubin as one of the officials asked to stay in his post—while attacking Democrats for not supporting nominees in recent weeks in the Republican-controlled Senate.
Sean Spicer, the incoming White House press secretary, told reporters Thursday at a news conference in Washington that the president-elect would keep Szubin on, citing the need to keep crucial government posts filled in the new administration's first days.
Senate Republicans refused to hold a confirmation vote for Szubin after Obama moved to appoint him to the permanent undersecretary post in 2015. He had bipartisan support, but the reasons Republicans blocked his nomination was unclear. That prompted Democrats to accuse the GOP of intentionally paralyzing Obama's government.
On Thursday, Spicer went on to accuse Senate Democrats of unfairly slowing down the confirmations of Trump Cabinet nominees. "I think what's a shame right now is to see some of those individuals who we would call consensus candidates— people who even they didn't find a problem with, people like secretary Elaine Chao, Ben Carson, Nikki Haley — suddenly not be part of Sen. [Chuck] Schumer's list that he will work with us to get done on Day One," Spicer said. "It's disappointing."
Szubin, who served in both the Bush and Obama administrations, has been serving in his post at Treasury in an acting capacity since early 2015. He was nominated formally in April 2015. The Senate Banking Committee approved his nomination almost a year later; it has been stalled in the full Senate since then.
Study challenges notion that inhaled anesthetic is superior during open-heart surgery.
The culmination of more than 20 years of research looking into the properties of intravenous anesthetic propofol by Vancouver Coastal Health Research Institute scientist Dr. David Ansley and his team of researchers is reflected in Dr. Ansley's recently published, and controversial, paper in the Canadian Journal of Anesthesia. Central to the paper is a 10-year-long clinical study looking specifically at whether propofol offers an effective approach to protecting the heart from damage during open-heart surgery, particularly amongst diabetes patients whose hearts are more vulnerable to such harm. The study was supported by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research, Canadian Anesthesia Research Foundation, and International Anesthesia Research Foundation.
In the mid-1980s, researchers began investigating whether inhaled anesthetic could – in addition to anesthetizing patients – effectively pre-condition the heart to mitigate the stress that the muscular organ experiences during open-heart surgery. Their studies focused on finding strategies for inhaled anesthetic that could increase the heart's ability to withstand damage that happens after its blood flow has been stopped (ischemia) and when its blood supply returns (reperfusion), which is called ischemia-reperfusion injury.
Today, a significant amount of data indicates that inhalational anesthetics work well for cardiac surgery because of their cardioprotective effects; however, little data exists showing that propofol offers the same benefit.
While other research groups focused on how to best to produce cardioprotective effects using inhaled anesthetic, Dr. Ansley was testing propofol's potential for cardioprotection using a technique he and his group developed in experimental heart models, then developed for use in patients. The technique involved highly controlled, increasing doses of propofol for a very focused period of time during cardiopulmonary bypass. The ultimate goal was to administer the anesthetic to diabetic patients during open-heart surgery.
He and his team found that compared to the commonly used inhaled anesthetic isoflurane, continuous systemic combined with intermittent delivery of propofol during ischemia-reperfusion was associated with better health outcomes following aortocoronary bypass surgery. Propofol may be a preemptive cardioprotectant for patients with type 2 diabetes.
Propofol paradigm shifts toward pro-oxidant rather than anti-oxidant
Propofol was thought to protect the heart because of its supposed antioxidant properties. With this in mind, Dr. Ansley and his team wanted to investigate if they could adapt propofol use during open-heart surgery to take advantage of its antioxidant potential to offset cell damage.
“Our limited understanding at the time was: if you render the heart ischemic and then reperfuse it, that's a real stimulus for free-radical biology, which basically generates these unstable, negatively charged particles of oxygen that can be very disruptive to cell membranes, proteins, DNA, and can result in injury, dysfunction, or death of organs,” Dr. Ansley, who is a clinical professor in the Department of Anesthesiology, Pharmacology and Therapeutics in the Faculty of Medicine at the University of British Columbia, explains. “This has been the operating paradigm for years: anesthesiologists are taking advantage of an antioxidant property of propofol to stop free radical insult, which ultimately is expected to translate into improved outcomes.”
However, upon examining the use of the drug in increasing concentrations to evaluate its effect on the heart, Dr. Ansley and his team began seeing otherwise in cells in vitro and in patients in surgery.
“Quite paradoxically, based on our research we think the drug actually stimulates a process that is pro-oxidant, rather than antioxidant, and the cells in the heart are responding to these pro-oxidant activities,” he explains. “Originally we thought we're protecting the heart by soaking up free radicals, but the reality is that propofol and how we administer it is actually changing the biology of the heart to a more favourable profile that protects mitochondria, keeping cell tissue alive.”
“This is an entirely different paradigm, and different from how inhaled anaesthetics probably work. The whole biology connected to the use of propofol is different, meaning the mechanisms are different, and therefore the outcomes are different. And few people know this.”
“The good news is, yes, we've found a technique that doesn't currently exist that we actually believe will be of true benefit to diabetes patients undergoing open-heart surgery,” says Dr. Ansley.
The challenging news though is that propofol does not behave as researchers originally thought.
“In fact, it's much more complex than what we thought,” he says. “But as we understand that complexity more, we can begin to identify which patients might benefit from this because we have an underlying understanding of how the biology is changed by the drug. We're basically beginning down the road of predictive medicine.”
Dr. Ansley cautions that the study's results should be considered more hypothesis-generating than confirmatory. And given the paradigm shifting results, he and his team are continuing researching the molecular mechanism, functional significance, and therapeutic impact of propofol cardioprotection in patients with type 2 diabetes.
B2B marketing today has come a long way. A long time ago, in a mystical period known as the 80s, companies that needed to increase their client base depended primarily on the telephone to generate leads.
Today, marketers are provided with more options for promoting their products and services with higher chances of acquiring high profile conversions. Along with social media, mobile marketing is one of these innovative channels that have made it possible for B2B companies from various industries to increase sales as well as broaden their brands' influence.
On that note, B2B marketers are constantly seeking for effective ways to leverage mobile devices in their lead generation. Oftentimes, since the effectiveness of mobile isn't absolute, marketers can unknowingly apply the wrong methods. These inevitably cost mobile campaigns dearly, and companies should best identify and stay away from them.
What you can do to avoid these mistakes is to take into account these effective mobile marketing tips courtesy of Huffington Post contributor and digital marketing strategist Scott MacFarland.
Irrelevant Content
Put your consumer hat on. Do you like it when you get spammed from companies that are sending you irrelevant communications? Brands must make sure they are producing content that is perfectly aligned with their persona's needs. If they don't, their competition will, and that will be revenue lost.

Poor Timing Of Communication
Marketers tend to pay attention to the timing of emails, social posts and believe it or not, even their direct mail (does that still happen?). That also means we must think about the customer, their habits, desires and needs, and serve them the perfect offer at the perfect time with the right message. If a text based offer for a lunch special comes at dinnertime, guess what? We've missed the opportunity.

Continued Communication That's Not Relevant
The key here is “continued” communication. As a brand, it is considered a cardinal sin to continually send communication and marketing messages to prospective customers and even existing customers if the message is not relevant. This will annoy them and soon they may unsubscribe from your communication channel – then you've lost them. You invested time and money to get them, now you need to spend the extra time to figure out what they want, when they want it. This increases engagement, website traffic, customer lifetime value and ultimately increases revenue.
Don't Forget About Location
Mobile marketing is not just about connecting with the customer. It's also about understanding their location as well. The retail market is a perfect business model to leverage the power of mobile, especially when they take advantage of location data. This data helps the marketer have a more complete data set, which allows them to craft strategies more effectively – thus increasing engagement, retention and store traffic.
Coupons
Regardless of your business, a coupon can be used to drive in-store foot traffic, online conversions, and customer retention or even help promote a new product or service. In a highly competitive market, coupons show value to the customer, especially if it is delivered in a timely manner with the right message. There are many ways to use a coupon and a mobile device is the perfect vehicle to deliver the brand message anywhere, anytime.
Overall Value To The Customer
Marketing 101 says, if the brand is not offering value for the customer, a transaction won't occur. When mobile marketing is not offering value to each and every customer, the brand in essence is communicating to them that they just want your name, mobile phone number and of course your money, not your respect and trust.

Find The Right Mobile Partner
This is an absolute must for any CMO or CIO looking to dive into mobile marketing. I have experienced a few poor decisions when agencies were hired and they didn't really have the expertise needed to execute. The tip here is to find a mobile company that knows mobile marketing strategy and technology better than anyone else. You don't want a company that's just a reseller of another knock-off service. Additionally, make sure the mobile partner has a robust customer centric service team to help when you need it. When you do find a company that can do all of these, you will soon realize they are the smartest firms and you want them to be on your side because mobile technology is moving at warp spend and your agency partner must be able to move with it successfully.
Think Like A Customer – Act Like An Intelligent Brand
Don't allow your mobile marketing to negatively impact your sales. Make sure you take full advantage of the data sets that are available. This will help you not only understand your customer, but communicate with them on their mobile device in a precise manner and location that truly excites and engages them to want to make the effort to purchase. Take advantage of all your customer data sets and think like a customer, but act like an intelligent brand.

Media playback is not supported on this device Jelavic greets Goodison crowd
Everton have signed Croatia international striker Nikica Jelavic from Rangers for £5.5m.
The 26-year-old joins the Blues on a four-and-a-half-year deal.
Jelavic, who moved to the Gers from Rapid Vienna in August 2010, has scored 17 goals in all competitions so far this season.
He becomes David Moyes' third signing of the January transfer window, following deals for Landon Donovan and Darron Gibson.
Everton
Nikica Jelavic Started career at Hajduk Split, scoring eight goals in 41 games
After five years he left for Belgian side S.V. Zulte Waregem where he scored three goals in 25 games in one season at the club
He then spent three seasons at Rapid Vienna, scoring 40 goals in 93 matches
In August 2010 he joined Rangers for £4m and has since netted 36 goals in 55 matches
Has 17 caps for Croatia and two goals
Jelavic received a warm reception after being introduced to Everton supporters at half- time in Tuesday's 1-0 Premier League win over Manchester City at Goodison Park.
He will be available to make his first appearance in Saturday's trip to Wigan.
"It is great news for us. We have been looking for a centre forward for a while. We just hope now he can help us score some goals and we can build on tonight's performance," said Everton manager David Moyes.
"I think tonight he would have seen the hard work that the players put in. He is coming from a great football club but I think he is coming to another great football club.
"He really wants to play in the Premier League and he really wants to play for Everton. That goes a long way.
"He will also want to play for Croatia in the European Championship so hopefully that will keep his form good, keep him hungry to score and play well."
Jelavic said he would relish playing in the Premier League.
"It is a big thing for me and it is a new step in my career, a step forward," he told the Everton club website.

"The Scottish Premier League is not as high a level as here in England but I think it will help a lot as it is not so much a big difference.
"I think I can bring some good football and to score many goals and to try to win some trophies."
Moyes was initially interested in Jelavic when he moved to Ibrox from Rapid Vienna for £4m in August 2010.
Scottish champions Rangers are currently experiencing financial problems and failed to replace Jelavic before the transfer window closed after having a bid for Norwich City's Grant Holt rejected but club owner Craig Whyte defended the sale.
"The reality of Jelavic's departure is two-fold," he said. "One, the player wanted to leave and there is no point in trying to keep a player who no longer wants to be at Ibrox.
"Two, the club is simply not in a financial position to turn down offers for players which give the club a good return on its original investment."
Rangers manager Ally McCoist had admitted on Saturday that Jelavic's departure would be "a big loss".
"I'd also like to tell you I wouldn't like to lose him. Of course I wouldn't, because he's a good player. But I understand the economics of our club and I understand the economics of football. Sometimes they dictate and determine what happens," he said.

One thing that becomes more apparent by the day is that Barack Obama is at best prevaricating when he pretends to come from a humble background. The soon-to-be-released book by David Maraniss, excerpted by Vanity Fair magazine, reports that both of Obama's white college girlfriends were wealthy and from prominent families, as were his many Pakistani friends. What are the odds that all of Barry's chums were rich?
Of course, Obama supporters will likely rationalize that since he attended the creme de la creme of colleges–on loans and scholarships, of course–then he had no choice but to befriend the wealthy because he was the only “poor” student. Note, however, that one must very carefully read all mainstream media articles about Obama's past, as well as the many authorized biographies, to discern truth from planned befuddlement.
What's seldom publicized in the mainstream media are the circumstances of his childhood–that the homes in which he lived in Indonesia were relatively luxurious and that the family had many servants such as chauffeurs, cooks, maids, and nannies for the three children.
The house was a pavilyun, an annex on the grounds of a bigger main house. It had three bedrooms, a kitchen, a bathroom, a library and a terrace. Like the households of other Indonesians who could afford it, it had a sizable domestic staff. Two female servants shared a bed­room; two men — a cook and a houseboy — slept mostly on the floor of the house or in the garden. The staff freed Ann from domestic obligations to a degree that would have been almost impossible in the United States. There were people to clean the house, prepare meals, buy groceries and look after her children — enabling her to work, pursue her inter­ests and come and go as she wanted.
Yes, three children, unless you believe the falsehood that Lia Soetoro Sobah was Barry's nanny and not his adopted sister.
How could Lia be Barry's nanny, when the mainstream media recently introduced us to Turdi (aka Evie), his transgender, biologically-male nanny? That's Turdi at the top of this post, in drag, obviously much younger than s/he is today.
Lia can hardly enlighten us, because like so many others, she's conveniently deceased, having died suddenly and mysteriously on her way to an interview with the media, before Obama as suddenly canceled his visit to Indonesia.
It's possible that the Indonesian word that our media translated as nanny is more accurately translated as babysitter. It's likely that Lia, being four years older than Barry, was at times recruited to watch her younger brother, as many sisters are. If you're thinking that Lia was one of those two female servants, think again. Lia reports having her own bed but that she shared a bedroom with Barry. In her own words, she described to the Indonesian media how she came to live in the Soetoro home, and how Barry was brought to Indonesia to be her brother. Her surname was Soetoro.
So there were three children in the Lolo Soetoro household: Barry and Lia, together from 1967 until early 1971, when Barry was sent to Hawaii; and Barry's younger half-sister Maya, who was added to the family in August 1970. Adopted sister Lia lived in the household before Barry was brought over from Hawaii.
Barry remained a short time in Indonesia after his half-sister Maya's birth. There's a much-seen photo of the family taken in Indonesia when Maya was just months old. (Many believe this photo is heavily photoshopped and that Barry was added to the image.)
Not long after Maya's birth, Barry (but not Maya) was sent packing to live with his grandparents in Hawaii, where he was enrolled in the extremely expensive Punahou school. One has to wonder if there was a reason other than education that prompted the separation of these siblings.
Was Barry jealous of his new sister, who arrived nine years after his birth and who was doted upon by his mother and even his “beloved” white grandmother, Toot, who traveled to Indonesia to see the new baby?
Could the young girl in the background, above, be Lia? What's curious is that another photo shows Barry and Maya with Maya's nanny:
This woman is not identified in the caption, but her face is not Turdi's.
Turdi (Evie) Barry Obama's nanny
So the question now is: Did each child have a nanny?
Turdi, then a cook, met Stanley Ann Dunham at a cocktail party in 1969, when Barry was 8. “Ann” hired Turdi to work in her home; he later became Barry's “caretaker.” Not long afterward, Maya was born. The story goes that Turdi remained with the family until they left “in the early 1970s.” Barry went to Hawaii in 1971, to live with his grandparents.
When Maya came along, did she get her own nanny? It appears so.
There seems to be no mention of Lia Soetoro Sobah or Turdi/Evie in Janny Scott's definitive biography of Stanley Ann Dunham, (so far as I can tell by searching Google books.) We can easily see from the photo of Maya's nanny, that she is NOT Lia Soetoro Sobah.
Lia Soetoro Sobah
If Lia were Barry's nanny, then why was Turdi hired? Why do the biographers mention some of the hired help, such as Saman, who reported that Ann Dunham beat Barry with Lolo's belt and that Barry at times struck Saman? (A regular little bully towards the domestic help.)
Why is Lia discussed in the Indonesian media and even in the Indonesian consular records, but definitely not discussed in any of the authorized biographies?
Nanny or adopted daughter, you'd think someone who spent 4 years with Barry, even slept in the same room with him, would deserve a mention.
Why was Turdi hired as Barry's nanny? Why was this cross-dressing nanny not mentioned in any of the biographies? You'd certainly think that deserved a mention, if not a photograph or two!
So many questions. So few answers.

MUMBAI (Reuters) - India's IRB InvIT Fund is seeking to raise as much as 46.5 billion rupees ($723.6 million) in an initial public offering next week, kicking off the first-ever listing of an infrastructure investment trust in the country.
IRB InvIT Fund, which is sponsored by IRB Infrastructure Developers Ltd, plans to raise up to 43 billion rupees by selling new shares in a price range of 100 rupees to 102 rupees per share.
IRB Infra and other shareholders are also selling a further up to 34.8 million shares in the IPO, which will open on May 3 and close May 5.
There will be a greenshoe option of up to 25 percent of the issue size, IRB InvIT said in a statement.
Infrastructure Investment Trusts and Real Estate Investment Trusts are entities that invest in rent-yielding assets and distribute most of their income to shareholders as dividends.
India's capital markets regulator, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI), late last year eased regulations for REITs and InvITs to woo more investors to the country's capital-starved property and infrastructure sector.
“We would expect at least three to four more issues to hit the market this year on the InvIT side. Probably, REIT will also pick up in the latter half of the year,” said Ajay Saraf, executive director at ICICI Securities, one of the four banks managing the IRB InvIT IPO.
IRB InvIT will own, operate and maintain a portfolio of six toll-road assets in the states of Maharashtra, Gujarat, Rajasthan, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu. The proceeds from the IPO will be used to pay down some debt.
IDFC Bank, Credit Suisse and IIFL are the other banks managing the IPO.

Ferrari Rocher: Undefeated kickboxing world champion covers £200,000 supercar with garish layer of gold vinyl
The Ferrari 458 Spider belongs to kickboxer Riyadh Al-Azzawi
It reportedly cost £4,000 to cover the car with gold vinyl
It was snapped while the fighter was training at a nearby gym

Supercars are always something of a status symbol and Ferraris come pretty high up even that lofty hierarchy.
However, for kickboxing world champion Riyadh Al-Azzawi just buying one of the flashest cars on the market isn't enough.
The Iraqi fighter went even further, wrapping his £200,000 458 Spiders with gold vinyl - for the comparably reasonable price tag of £4,000.
The £200,000 supercar belongs to kickboxing world champion Riyadh Al-Azzawi
The car, capable of a top speed of 199mph, was snapped while the fighter was training in a nearby gym
Riyadh Al-Azzawi is undefeated in all 47 of his career bouts and has retained his world champion title since winning it in 2008

Fuel consumption: 19.9 mpg
CO2 Emissions: 0.442 kgCO2/mile
These snaps were taken when Mr Al-Azzawi parked the Italian supercar outside a gym in Kensington, London, where he was training and it wasn't long before it attracted crowds of gawping onlookers.
Tim Burton, who runs the YouTube car channel Shmee150, which makes videos about supercars seen around the capital, said: 'I've seen some pretty exciting cars roaming the streets of London, but a golden Ferrari is about as bold as you can get.
'If you want to cause a scene, this is the way to do it.'
The Ferrari 458 Spider is the convertible version of the popular supercar which is widely regarded as one of the greatest cars built by the Italian firm.
It is powered by a 4.5-litre V8 engine which, located behind the driver, develops a whopping 562bhp.
This gives it a 0-62mph time of 3.4 seconds and a top speed of 199mph.
Mr Al-Azzawi took up kickboxing when he was 13 and became Iraq national champion six times and Arabic champion twice before moving to the UK. He quickly become British champion twice over before moving on to claim the European title.
He won his world-champion belt in 2008 and has defended it against all challengers since, he currently has a career record of 47 wins out of 47 bouts, with 35 knockouts.
The fighter said his ambition is to unite Iraq through kickboxing and to defend his title in his home country.
He also hit the headlines in 2008 after the death of singer Suzanne Tamim, with who he was close friends, some reports even claimed they had been married before her death.

Shutterstock An experimental drug derived from cannabis to treat epilepsy is on the brink of becoming the first of its kind to win US government approval.
The drug's active ingredient is cannabidiol, the compound in marijuana thought to be responsible for many of its therapeutic effects. Cannabidiol doesn't contain THC, marijuana's main psychoactive ingredient, so it doesn't get users high.
According to results from two large clinical trials released over the past two months, however, cannabidiol does appear to help reduce seizures in two of the hardest-to-treat forms of epilepsy, Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome and Dravet Syndrome.
If approved, the new drug would be sold under the name Epidiolex as a syrup.
Because drugmaker GW Pharma was able to show that the product addresses a critical need, it was able to apply for a designation that could speed up the approval process. The company still faces some hurdles, though — the FDA has not yet approved any applications to sell marijuana for a health condition, and hasn't given the green light to any drugs containing cannabidiol.
The first cannabidiol trial looked at the effects of the drug by studying 225 young people with Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome. The subjects were split into groups and given either a higher or lower dose of the drug or a placebo for 14 weeks. The results, presented at the American Academy of Neurology's yearly meeting in Boston, showed that participants in the higher-dose group saw their seizure occurrence drop by about 42%. Those given the lower dose saw a decrease of roughly 37%, and those given the placebo only saw a 17% reduction.
Courtesy GW Pharma The second trial, the results of which were published this week in the New England Journal of Medicine, looked at 120 children with Dravet syndrome. Half were given the drug and half received a placebo. Forty-three percent of participants given the drug saw their seizures reduced by half, and 5% stopped having seizures entirely. By comparison, the seizure rate in the group given a placebo barely budged.
Those promising findings build on previous research conducted last year by GW Pharma.
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, epilepsy affects more than 4.3 million Americans. Among these millions, however, various types and forms of the condition exist — and everyone reacts to treatments differently.
GW Pharma aims to submit its new drug application to the FDA by the middle of the year, and is exploring treatments for various forms of epilepsy, though Epidiolex would treat only two specific types of the condition.
While Epidiolex could be the first cannabidiol-based drug to get FDA approval, the agency has already given the green light to two other drugs that contain components of cannabis: Marinol and Syndros are designed to treat anorexia using dronabinol, a synthetic form of THC.
We're having some problems. Problems with time. Problems with capacity. Problems with promises. Problems with saying no. Ultimately, I kind of see them as problems with reality.
Six months ago, this company was trying to do everything without magic at all. Nothing was being delivered, the customers were abandoning ship, and the cabal of developers who had held the whole thing together with duct tape and chewing gum decided to take their 100000 lines of spaghetti code and call it a day. The people who ran the company – those C level people – were left in a desperate place. Looking at a future of poverty and misfortune – or becoming just oh so slightly less rich than they were – it was probably a fairly easy choice to go the black magic route. I mean, everybody's seen Harry Potter, nobody is too concerned about a little bit of spell casting here and there. We're just not allowed to mention Death Eaters, or blood sacrifice, or the possibility of everything going tits up once Article 50 is invoked. I mean, shit, how did Brexit get approved, anyway? How did Donald Trump get elected? These are indications of black magic as clear as three “hundred year” floods in a decade are a marker of global warming. Only fools believe in coincidences; practitioners look for the patterns.
The demon-possessed head of development sat at a table surrounded by us, his unwilling minions. We'd had a few of these meetings, and each time he's made a few subtle changes. I caught that the cables on top of the conference room table now formed a five pointed star, and that one of the ten slides showing our progress was actually a flickering invocation of some sort, the kind that had people chanting as they washed their hands in the bathrooms … completely without realizing it. None of the other managers seemed to have noticed an alteration in how things were being done, and all happily put on white robes and embroidered sashes as they walked in to our “weekly catchup.” I dropped my silver ward beneath my shirt and hoped it was enough.
We sat down and began to go through the progress reports. Line after line, the individual teams' Jira tickets were called out. A rythm began to form, and the team leaders began to recite the words on the screen in unison. “Over the line,” the dev master said. “Over the line,” everyone repeated. We were lulled into a haze. And suddenly ….
We were in a wagon, with the back covered in white cloth. Each of the so-called “scrum masters” sat quietly, holding hands, facing forward. while the man in the driver's seat cracked his whip. The horses pulling us were black, their hooves shooting sparks as they hit the rocks of the plateau we were careening across, their eyes blood red and glowing. Nothing about them was of the planet I grew up on. And in the distance, I saw the edge, a great gaping maw waiting for our little white Conestoga to arrive.
Behind us, I watched as a tiny man on a donkey galloped along behind us. What would it have taken to have stopped this chase? A peashooter? A particularly juicy clump of grass? The simple word, “No?” But the demon mastered were under the spell. I could not stop my lips from mouthing, “Over the line! Over the line!” as we barreled forward, even though I kept my vocal cords silent. And in the split second before the wheels parted from the earth I grabbed my stop watch and hit go … because I had promised I would do performance testing and this was the only fucking environment to do it I would ever get.
My neck snapped backwards as we collapsed into a singularity and I was back in the room. Everyone looked up, their eyes shining. We were going to do eight projects with only enough time and staff for six, really really honestly, and everyone was saying it and believed it. But on a tiny piece of paper, I scribbled the number, “5,” and tucked it behind the case of my phone. Time had stopped. The meeting was over. We all walked outside to meet our doom. And I had a tiny memorial of the truth that everyone had chosen to believe in the moment of group madness: the time/cost/quality triangle was a reality that no team of supernatural horses could truly escape, no matter how perfectly in unison we chanted. Two projects would die, one would fail due to shifting priorities, and I would get the prize out of a crackerjack box when I reminded myself that I had escaped the group think and kept true to the One True Path of the Triangle. Also, I had my performance metrics. Five: the perfect number.

At least 300 African migrants have stormed a border fence in an attempt to cross into the Spanish territory of Melilla from Morocco, officials say.
Morocco security forces clashed with the migrants, leaving 27 people wounded, they added.
Ninety-six migrants were arrested, while about 100 managed to cross over, the officials said.
Melilla is a major crossing point for sub-Saharan Africans seeking work or asylum in Europe.
Together with a second Spanish enclave, Ceuta, it is the European Union's only land border with Africa.
Many of those making the dangerous journey come from Eritrea and Somalia.

The Moroccan interior ministry said the migrants hurled rocks at the security forces as they stormed the six-metre (20-foot) high double barbed wire fence on Monday.
Thirteen security force members and 14 migrants were wounded in the clashes, it added in a statement.
A Spanish government spokeswoman said the migrants were "very violent" and had targeted two different sections of the border fence, the AFP news agency reports.
About 150 African migrants made it into Melilla after a similar assault on the border fence on 17 February.
At least 14 migrants drowned in Moroccan waters on 6 February while trying to enter Ceuta by sea.
Spain's interior ministry confirmed on Friday that police fired rubber bullets as the migrants swam into Spanish territory, but denied the shooting contributed to the drowning.
In Vineland, New Jersey, the Office of the Attorney General has ordered the contract bakery Omni Baking Company to pay $60,000 to defendant Ashley Ruiz-Lopez. Omni violated state law by firing Ruiz-Lopez while she was on maternity leave.
Ruiz-Lopez had worked as a receptionist at Omni Baking Company since June 2014. Despite giving clear notification and communication regarding her planned start and end dates, the company fired her while she was on leave.
“The totality of the circumstances, including her submission of medical certificates showing her expected recovery dates, repeated visits to the office, repeated attempts to reach (the HR manager), and the nature of her leave, was sufficient to trigger Respondent's legal responsibility to engage in the interactive process,” said Division of Civil Rights director Craig T. Sashihara in a release.
Ruiz-Lopez submitted a claim for temporary disability benefits when she started leave at the end of January 2016. She also submitted paperwork that including a doctor's note stating her due date of Feb. 27th, and expected return date in mid-April.
According to Ruiz-Lopez, she made multiple attempts in person and over the phone to contact the company's human resource department but never received an answer. The bakery fired her on March 29, 2016. Ruiz-Lopez consequently filed a complaint with the Division of Civil Rights.
“An employee should not have to choose between keeping her job and raising a family,” said Sashihara. “New Jersey's family leave and pregnancy protection laws were created to maintain the integrity of the family unit and help society prosper. Our commitment is to ensure that employers adhere to those laws.”
Omni Baking Company will pay $60,000 to the defendant and $10,000 to the division. Additionally, the company has been ordered to “create and distribute a new family leave policy, provide anti-discrimination training to its roughly 450 employees, and submit to a year of monitoring by the division”.

Even as some argue exactly what it is, functional programming keeps attracting developers. And three of the most popular functional languages -- Clojure, F#, and Scala -- are on tap for improvements.
Functional programming has a core appeal for some developers, says Scala founder Martin Odersky: "The programmers in that segment like functional programming because it makes code clearer, better structured, and it prevents many classes of errors." But some argue that functional programming leads to less-efficient software.
[ Download the InfoWorld quick guide: Learn to crunch big data with R. | Keep up with hot topics in programming with InfoWorld's Application Development newsletter. ]
Functional programming also requires thinking about programming in a new way, says David Stephens, Microsoft's program manager for .Net and a spokesman for F#. Abstractions can be an issue: "When you make code more abstract, when you're moving further away from manipulating bits and explicitly going through loops, it can take more time to understand these abstractions."
What is a functional language, exactly?
In its most basic terms, functional programming is about treating computation as mathematical functions. In addition to languages billed as functional from the start, the likes of Java and C# have become more functional by adding support for lambda expressions.
But a precise definition of functional programming can be hard to pin down. The Clojurefun blog cites several definitions it believes are incorrect, including defining functional programming as enabling a functional style with higher-order functions or a language supporting lambdas. It says the correct definition is a language emphasizing functions and immutable data.
But the Clojure blog's preferred definition isn't necessarily correct, others say. "The author picks one, which incidentally fits Clojure best -- no wonder, this is a Clojure blog," Scala's Odersky says. "I have an interpretation that is close to his, but not the same."
A function, Odersky says, is a piece of code that maps inputs to outputs and has no other effects beyond that. "It's the mathematical definition of function we are using here. Sometimes these functions are called 'pure,' to distinguish them from, say, functions in C." A functional language focuses on programming with pure functions, making it easy and powerful to do so, says Odersky, who founded Typesafe, the provider of the Typesafe JVM application development platform.
Functional programming can be combined with other paradigms, he notes. "For instance, functional goes really well with object-oriented. Scala is a functional language in that sense. I agree that just having lambdas does not make a language functional; it is necessary but not sufficient."
Clojure developer Rich Hickey, who's also CTO at systems developer Cognitect, concurs with a main contention of the Clojure blog. "The article correctly points out that first-class or higher-order functions are not what functional programming is all about. Functional programming is about making programming more like mathematics," he says. That says, there still remains a spectrum of definitions for functional programming, Hickey says.
Microsoft's Stephens sees functional capabilities extending beyond languages alone. "The most popular functional programming language in the world is Excel," he says. A simple Excel worksheet might have a column with a bunch of values in it, such as A1 X 2. "That's a pure function on A1, and A1 doesn't change, so you're computing values from that existing data."
Microsoft's Language-Integrated Query (Linq) technology also provides for functional programming, he says. "Almost every programming language now is adopting features from functional languages."
Stephens cites immutable data as critical to functional programming. Concurrency -- programs with multiple threads operating on data simultaneously -- also benefits from immutable data, he notes. "We call [F#] a functional-first language because it comes from a heritage of other languages." It also supports object-oriented programming and operates with C# and Visual Basic, he says.
Clojure's Hickey sees adoption of functional languages as a response to the increasing pressure facing developers, who have to take on bigger problems these days. "To do so, they must reduce the incidental complexity of their programs. It is now widely recognized that pervasive state and side effects are a primary source of complexity and bugs in programs," Hickey says. "While it is possible to reduce the amount of state in programs written in nonfunctional languages, it is dramatically easier and faster to do so in a language that makes functional programming idiomatic and the default."
What's next for the three top functional languages
The 13-year-old Scala is a primary language in data science, says Scala founder Odersky. Supported on the JVM, it has an estimated 400,000 to 500,000 users. Plans in the short term call for it to be optimized for Java 8, in which bytecode instructions from the latest standard Java upgrade would enable Scala to generate more efficient code.
In the longer term, Scala will get a cleaned-up type system, safer macros, and more platform support, with an LLVM compiler back end under consideration. Further improvements are planned to improve the usability of Scala.js, for compiling Scala to JavaScript.
The nine-year-old Clojure, also based on the JVM, has been used in finance, retail, software, and entertainment, Hickey says. "It's been applied in diverse application areas such as transaction processing and analysis, big data, network operations, predictive analytics, search, security, and consumer offerings."
The 11-year-old F# was founded by Microsoft Research by Don Syme and is overseen by the F# Foundation. It is used in a wide range of applications and runs on Linux, OS X, Android, iOS, Windows, and browsers. "What we're working on now is the make it work with .Net Core," an open source, cross-platform modular version of the .Net Framework, Stephens says. String interpolation, making it easier to write strings, is on the drawing board.
