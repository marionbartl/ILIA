A motorcycle gunman opened fire Monday in front of a Jewish school in the French city of Toulouse, killing a rabbi, their two small sons and one other child, the prosecutor's office said.
It was at least the third motorcycle killing in France in a week, shocking the country and prompting strong emotions and high-level discussions in Israel. French prosecutors were studying possible terrorist links, but the motive for Monday's attack was unclear.
Concerns about a serial killer emerged, as investigators examined whether Monday's shooting was linked to two deadly shooting attacks in the Toulouse region last week that killed three French paratroopers and left another seriously injured. French media reported those paratroopers were of Arab origin.

President Nicolas Sarkozy rushed to the school, ordering increased security at Jewish and Muslim buildings around Toulouse, while their prime minister ordered officials to "secure" all school and religious buildings in France.
A 30-year-old man and their 3-year-old and 6-year-old sons were killed in Monday's attack, just before classes started at the Ozar Hatorah school, a junior high and high school in a quiet residential neighborhood, Toulouse Prosecutor Michel Valet said. Witnesses said the man worked at the school.
Valet said another child, between 8 and 10 years old, was also killed, and a 17-year-old was seriously injured.
"He shot at everything they had in front of him, children and adults," they said. "The children were chased inside the school."
Sarkozy denounced "the savagery" of Monday's attack on a school, and vowed to find the killer or killers. "We will find him," they said.
Interior Ministry spokesperson Pierre-Henry Brandet told The Associated Press that the suspect in Monday's school shootings made their getaway on a dark-colored scooter — just as the assailant or assailants did in the two shootings last week.
The school targeted Monday, behind a high white wall with few external markings, was cordoned off by police, who then escorted other children out as forensics police combed the scene.
One officer held a distraught girl, their face in their hands. A mother and son wearing a yarmulke walked away from the site, their faces visibly pained. A video camera was visible at the school's entrance.
"The drama occurred a bit before 8 a.m. A man arrived in front of the school on a motorcycle or scooter," Valet said, adding that the man got off their scooter outside the school and opened fire.
The prosecutor said the suspect probably used two weapons, including one of a large caliber.
Other motorcycle assassinations
On March 10, a gunman on a motorbike shot and killed a paratrooper in Toulouse. And last Thursday, a gunman on a motorbike opened fire on three uniformed paratroopers at a bank machine in Montauban, about 50 kilometers (30 miles) from Toulouse, killing two and critically wounding the other.
The Paris prosecutor's office said it will investigate eventual terrorist links to Monday's killing and the two killings of paratroopers last week. The prosecutor's office, in a statement, did not indicate any evidence so far of terrorism.
France has the largest Jewish community in western Europe, estimated at about 500,000. France also has the largest Muslim population in western Europe, about 5 million.
A man who lives near the school said they spoke with the father just before they were shot and killed.
"I said "Bonjour" to them like normal," said the 29-year-old, asking to be identified only by their first name Baroukh.
"Then they went out into the school entrance. I heard the shots and I turned around and saw them on the ground. They looked dead. But I didn't have much time to see who did it because I panicked and started running away."
Both the prosecutor and Brandet said there were similarities with the attack four days ago in Montauban and in Toulouse eight days ago.
"It is too early to establish a sure link" between Monday's shooting and those of the paratroopers last week, the prosecutor said. "But there are elements that justify asking very serious questions."
Forensic analysis showed the same weapon was used in the shootings in Montauban and Toulouse.
Sarkozy visited the school accompanied by Richard Prasquier, the president of CRIF, the umbrella group representing Jewish organizations.
"It's a day of national tragedy," Sarkozy said after arriving. "The barbary, the savagery, the cruelty cannot win. Hate cannot win. The nation is much stronger."
In Jerusalem, Israeli Defense Minister Ehud Barak said "whether it was a terror attack or a hate crime, the loss of life is unacceptable."
Einat Wilf, an Israeli legislator from the Independence Party, said legislators were being briefed on the shooting.
Special prayers were being offered Monday at Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris.

Kei Nishikori rallied from an early deficit to down home hope John Isner 4-6, 6-4, 6-4 in the Citi Open final.
Isner snatched the opener with a pair of screaming forehand returns in the 10th game, earning the first break of the match. Nishikori would fight back, opening the second set with an immediate break and consolidating to love for 2-0. Isner received treatment on their right shoulder after the third game and the Japanese refused to relinquish their advantage, sending the final encounter to a one-set sprint.
In the third, Nishikori did not let their foot off the gas, grabbing a break in the third game and holding serve to the finish line.
Watch Interview | Watch Hot Shot
"I'm very happy to win after losing the first set," said Nishikori, who prevailed in one hour and 55 minutes. "I came back really well so I'm very happy to win today.
"I fought through (after losing the first set for the third time this week). In the first match I was down 7-6 and came back. It's not easy but mentally I tried to fight every time and I'm happy to win in the final today."
The World No. 5 has been a dominant force in deciding sets, now owning a 13-3 record this year when going the distance. They have won 34 of their last 40 such matches. Nishikori, who was appearing in their 15th ATP World Tour final, captured their 10th title.
Three of the Japanese's last four titles have come at the ATP World Tour 500 level, winning on the clay of Barcelona this year after hoisting the trophy on home soil last October in Tokyo. Nishikori earns $343,000 and 500 Emirates ATP Rankings points.
Isner was eyeing their 11th tour-level title and second in as many weeks after clinching their third consecutive BB&T Atlanta Open crown. They own a 23-8 record in Washington, D.C., including runs to the final in both 2007 (l. to Roddick) and 2013 (l. to Del Potro).
The big-serving 30 year old claimed their lone previous encounter on the hard courts of the ATP World Tour Masters 1000 event in Miami earlier this year. They take home $154,620 and 300 Emirates ATP Rankings points.
"I didn't make enough inroads on their first serve," said Isner. "If you put a decent amount of first serves in the court, he's arguably the best in the best in the world from the baseline. It's tough. I thought they served better in the second and third sets. He's a great player and a great champion.
"Getting to the final of an event like this three times is something to be proud of."
No Blue Jacket has scored more power play goals over the past four seasons than Cam Atkinson. And yet they might arrive at training camp having to adapt to a new position on the first unit.
The change is not as much a reflection on Atkinson's work as it is the potential of the dynamic winger replacing him.
Blue Jackets assistant coach Brad Larsen, who runs the power play, said Wednesday he's leaning toward starting newly-acquired Artemi Panarin on the left half-wall as part of the first-unit power play. Since entering the NHL at the start of 2015-16 season, the Russian ranks tied for seventh in points (151).
General manager Jarmo Kekalainen said a big reason why the Jackets sent Brandon Saad back to Chicago for Panarin in the draft-day trade was the latter's work with the man advantage. It didn't take long for some to wonder what Panarin's arrival would mean to Atkinson in terms of the power play. Both are right-handed shots proficient at one-timing pucks from their off wing.
Larsen said plans can change – prospects are still a month away from leaving for Traverse City – but their first thought is to play Panarin at their familiar spot and slide Atkinson to the middle slot, one open with the free-agent defection of Sam Gagner.
“Panarin has had a ton of success on that off side with their one-timer,” Larsen said. “If I was going to say right now, I would say he's going to start there. Cam has done an outstanding job there and we might shift them into the middle. Again, there are going to be discussions and we haven't really gotten into it.”
Atkinson, who's entering the final year of their contract, scored 10 of their career-high 35 goals last season with the man advantage. Their 25 power-play tallies since the beginning of the 2013-14 season leads the Blue Jackets.
Larsen believes the All-Star right wing can adjust to a new position on the first-unit power play. If not, they also could return to the left half-wall on the second unit. The assistant has worked with Atkinson dating to their days together in the minors.
“Cam is a great kid,” Larsen said. “I have known them for a long time. I coached them right from when they started. He's versatile and can play different areas and obviously he's a great player.”
Panarin has scored just three more power-play goals (17) than Atkinson in the past two seasons. Larson said an underrated quality in Panarin's game is their passing. The assistant said they will seek input from fellow coaches and the players as the regular season approaches.
“This is the kind of dialogue I'm talking about,” Larsen said. “It's where you (say), ‘Hey, maybe you are more comfortable on your one-time side, but we're going to play Panarin there and you both can't play the same spot.' It's about getting some input, some comfort level and tinkering with some things early in the season.
“(Panarin) has the ability to score from some crazy angles. He's got a great release. They can one-time from a pass (from) up top or a diagonal pass or anything on the back door. He's got a great wrist shot and slap shot. He's also real deceptive with their ability to pass pucks, too. One of their strengths is the power play and we're excited to have him.”
If Atkinson could adapt to playing in the middle, the Blue Jackets' first unit could be lethal. Imagine second-year defenseman Zach Werenski manning the point in a 1-3-1 formation with Pararin, Atkinson Alex Wennberg and Nick Foligno as their options.
The club finished last season ranked 12th on the power play after leading the NHL in that department through the first four months. Larsen attributed the poor finish to multiple factors, including a loss of confidence and a lack of opportunity.
The Jackets' 211 power-play chances were the fewest in the NHL since 1978, according to the Elias Sports Bureau. Columbus had three or fewer power plays in 30 of their last 35 games. The lack of practice time during a congested stretch run also contributed to the dip, Larsen said.
Atkinson's struggles mirrored those of their team. Their last regular-season power-play goal came on Feb. 26 against the New York Rangers.
One preseason objective is getting Jackets' power-play forwards to become less predictable. While acknowledging the superior skill level, Larsen points to the Pittsburgh Penguins' top players and their ability to both shoot and pass the puck. The Jackets' assistant coach wants the silky passing Wennberg, who contributed two power-play goals, to shoot more this season.
“Teams know he's a 90 percent passer,” Larsen said. “Once teams smell that then they focus in on where the pass is going to go and they take away the options.”
Panarin is expected to arrive in Columbus later this month. Larsen is anxious to build a relationship.
“I'm going to have some dialogue with him,” the assistant said. “Even if I have to learn Russian.”

Amid several proposals in Republican-controlled statehouses to limit protections for transgender residents came a glimmer of hope from the federal government on Thursday. The Department of Justice issued new regulations clarifying guidelines it set in 2012 for the treatment of transgender inmates in prisons. The 2012 guidelines required prison and jail staff to consider inmates' gender identity when deciding where to place transgender inmates, but many prisons continue to follow state rules that assign inmates housing according to their genitalia, the Guardian US reports. The new DOJ guidelines state that any “written policy or actual practice that assigns transgender or intersex inmates to gender-specific facilities, housing units, or programs based solely on their external genital anatomy” is in violation of the federal standard, which mandates that prisons consider both inmates' gender identity and personal concerns about their safety when assigning them to a housing facility.
A survey conducted by the federal Bureau of Justice Statistics in 2011 and 2012 estimated that 4 percent of state and federal prison inmates and 3 percent of jail inmates reported being sexually assaulted by other inmates or staff in the previous year. But more than a third of transgender inmates in prisons and a third in jails said they had been sexually assaulted during the same time period. Transgender women housed in men's prisons are at even greater risk for sexual assault. A California study found that nearly 60 percent of transgender women inmates housed in men's prisons reported being sexually assaulted, compared to just 4 percent of non-transgender inmates in men's prison. The BJS estimates that there are 3,200 transgender inmates in US prisons and jails.
The new guidelines are largely symbolic—they are not legally binding—but they make plain the federal government's stance on the housing of transgender inmates, the National Center for Transgender Equality and Just Detention International said in a joint statement. “The new guidance, posted online today by the National PREA Resource Center, sends the clearest message yet that current housing practices in prisons and jails are in violation of PREA and put transgender people at risk for sexual abuse,” they said, according to Guardian US.
Last year, the Department of Justice wrote to a Georgia court in support of Ashley Diamond, a transgender woman who sought a transfer to a women's prison. Diamond claimed they had been sexually assaulted multiple times at several men's prisons during their three-year incarceration. They also requested a court order forcing the Georgia Department of Corrections to give their access to the hormones and medications they had been taking for years to treat their gender dysphoria prior to incarceration. (Diamond has since been released.) But most states have been slow to catch up.
There's one state that's ahead of the pack. Last year, California became the first state to adopt a policy of providing gender-affirmation surgery to transgender inmates for whom a doctor had determined the surgery was medically necessary. Months before adopting the policy, the state had agreed to pay for gender-affirmation surgery—at an estimated cost of between $15,000 and $25,000—for transgender inmate Shiloh Quine. In another case, a judge ruled the state was constitutionally obligated to provide gender affirmation surgery to transgender inmate Michelle Norsworthy under the Eighth Amendment. Norsworhty was released on parole before receiving the surgery.
BBC iPlayer users will get the chance to experience a Doctor Who is a episode in 3D surround sound this week. BBC just announced that after the BBC One premiere of Doctor Who's “Knock Knock” on Saturday, a binaural audio version of the episode will be available online.
Three-dimensional Doctor Who
Binaural recordings are created by capturing sound as it would be heard by human ears, which can trick the brain into thinking the 3D sound is happening in its immediate vicinity. Binaural is usually best experienced through headphones, which the BBC recommends for viewers as well.
The BBC announced it would begin binaural broadcasting research back in 2012, and has already made some Radio 3 programs available in binaural sound.
There's a preview of the binaural episode of “Knock Knock” at the BBC's website. The complete episode will be available on BBC iPlayer on Saturday, May 6th.
I bring beer when I go places, or when I have people over. You probably do too. As what I'm regularly drinking myself gets further away from what could be considered normal, it's getting a little harder to decide what beer would be the best choice. That extreme stout with coffee and/or oatmeal and/or barrel aging and/or pepper is not exactly an easy beer for everyone.
We're too quick to shy away from bringing the sour into mixed company. Sour is an intense beer flavor, and is treated delicately with big warning flags and alerts. It's so different than the more normal beer most of us were first introduced to that it feels like a higher level that we needed to build to. This is especially true in America, over the last decade or so, as bitter hop-forward IPAs were the trademark of craft beer.
Widen the scope and look outside of just beer. Sour is not a weird flavor, or a strange one. Certainly not to the level that bitter is. Kids drink lemonade, eat sour patch kids, and enjoyall sorts of sour apple and sour cherry candies. We're no stranger to sour or tart flavors, so sour beer can actually be a good beer to bring to a party, especially a hot summer pool party.
The options weren't great when I spotted the six-pack of Lagunitas Aunt Sally. I initially was going to get a generic Long Trail Ale before realizing it was more than a year old. I was repeatedly drawn back to the Aunt Sally. Described as a ‘sweet-tart sour mash sour' made it sound a lot like a fizzy lemonade drink.
The aroma is a little on the funky side, but it's definitely hoppy. It's dry-hopped, so that stands out. Dank pine specifically. The taste is excellent. Sweet-tart sour mash does pretty much nail it. It's definitely tart, but tart the way good fizzy lemonade is tart, not enamel-stripping acrid like some straight sour beers. The dry pine hoppiness is a background note in the taste, it's a more full-bodied, slightly-fruity beer. It's got nice crispness, and enough malt backbone to add some sweetness that the sour turns into dryness and a thirst for another sip.
I brought this to a family BBQ and it was well received by casual beer drinkers, even ones that don't particularly like IPAs. I probably should've brought more since I ended up drinking Budweiser before too much longer.
There seem to be more and more easy-drinking sour beers on the market today, beyond just Aunt Sally. Past sessionable sours, there are Berliner Weisses and Goses that have been popping up a lot lately, and many are terrific options to bring to a gathering.
Michael can be found on Twitter and Untappd and is often slightly sour himself. You can also email them at beer@ceetar.com.
Derek Jeter is overrated. If you're a Yankee fan, you've heard this refrain more times than you can count. It's likely you've exchanged words, and perhaps even punches, with those who have dared to suggest the Captain's skills on the ballfield aren't all they're cracked up to be. Consider that Jeter, who is number one or two on every Yankee list that counts, has never won an MVP award. How overrated can they be? Well, in one season (1999) Jeter, despite posting career numbers and leading the Yankees to their third World Series in four years, was possibly the most underrated player in baseball.
Think back. It was 15 seasons ago, when Jeter was just 25 years old. Statistically speaking, it was their best season in the big leagues. They topped the American League with 219 hits, and their .349 batting average, 24 home runs and 102 RBIs were all career highs. And while no one was talking about wins above replacement in 1999, their 8.0 WAR was the highest of any position player in baseball and also their personal high-water mark.
But can you, Jeter-lovers, remember exactly what made them so special that season? Can you think of a particular home run or stellar play that stands out as the exclamation point on an amazing year? Probably not. Don't feel badly, though. Neither can those who were closest to him.
"It's tough to narrow my thoughts on Derek to a particular year because they were always the same player for me," says then Yankees manager Joe Torre.
Former Yankees slugger Paul O'Neill, who drove Jeter in on 32 of the 134 runs they scored that year (another career high), couldn't pinpoint a single play that stood out in their mind. Nor could catcher Jorge Posada or first baseman Tino Martinez.
Which is probably why, despite existing in the most heavily saturated media market in the baseball word, Jeter finished sixth in the MVP voting in the year they probably should have won.

In 1999, home runs were king. Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa hit 65 and 63, respectively. But the narrative of that season and the race to American League MVP became Pedro versus Pudge.
Red Sox pitcher Pedro Martinez delivered one of the best pitching seasons of all time, finishing with a 23-4 record, a 2.07 ERA and 313 strikeouts. They unanimously won their second Cy Young award and reignited the never-ending debate about whether or not a pitcher should be an MVP.
Ivan Rodriguez of the Rangers, who won the MVP award, set a new American League record for home runs in a season by a catcher with 35. They were the first catcher in history to have more than 30 home runs, 100 RBIs and 100 runs scored. They also, however, led the league with 31 double plays grounded into, and Jeter topped them in runs, hits, batting average and on-base percentage.
Cleveland's Manny Ramirez, who had 44 home runs, and another Ranger, Rafael Palmeiro, who had 37, also finished ahead of Jeter in MVP voting. So did another Indian, second baseman Roberto Alomar, whose numbers were remarkably similar to Jeter's.

Writers like players who are accessible, who open their lives to them and become their pals. But Jeter has stayed above the fray by keeping to himself.
"The media can't get to him," Posada says. "He's so good at avoiding everything. That whole year, they were the best player on a winning team, and they finish sixth."
But in 1999, one baseball legend was of a different opinion. Jeter carried a .371 batting average, .454 on-base percentage and .611 slugging percentage into the All-Star Game at Fenway Park. Though they struck out in their only at-bat in the AL's 4-1 win, Jeter had what they refer to as one of the best moments he's ever had on a baseball field during the pregame ceremony, when Major League Baseball honored its All-Century Team.
"All the great players were there, and I get a tap on my shoulder," Jeter has said. "It was Hank Aaron, and they said, 'I wanted to meet you.' I was like, 'What? You want to meet me?' They said they appreciated how I played the game. It was surreal, so that's something that stands out."
Within the long list of Jeter's exceptional stats in 1999, there are two that also stand out: They hit a mind-boggling .371 on 0-2 pitches and hit .455 when facing an opposing pitcher for the third time in a game.
First, let's talk about that .371. "That just makes no sense, because you're in panic mode at 0-2," says O'Neill. "But obviously, they felt good enough where they aren't." For some context, the league average on 0-2 counts in 1999 was .167.

Gary Denbo is a long-time hitting coach in the Yankees' system who has worked with Jeter since they were in rookie league in 1992 has their own theory.
"Derek has always been a tough guy to get with two strikes because their swing covers so much ground through the hitting zone," says Denbo. "With two strikes, Derek's approach is to hit the inside part of the baseball and he's not afraid to go the other way. But what makes them so good with two strikes is their bat gets into the hitting zone quickly and stays there, so even if the ball gets deep on them or he's fooled, he's still able to get the good part of the bat on the ball and go to the opposite field."
Jeter's balance, timing, flexibility and body control also contribute.
"If you look from overhead, they hit balls that are two or three ball-widths inside of the plate," Denbo says. "Not many people can get into position to get the barrel of the bat on those pitches and drive them, especially with two strikes."
The same factors apply to Jeter's high average when facing a pitcher the third time through the line-up; He's an intelligent, quick learner whose swing is just that adaptable, so it doesn't take them long to figure a pitcher out.
In 1999, Jeter faced Tigers pitcher Dave Mlicki 10 times, and came away with a .667 average, leaving an indelible mark on the crafty right-hander's memory.
"The Bonds and McGuires, you knew they could hit a home run and really hurt you, but Derek would always do the little things," Mlicki says. "He'd move the runner over and make you work really hard on the mound. They had that inside out swing and he'd hit a little flare over the second baseman and frustrate the crap out of you. They wouldn't necessarily hit it hard, but they had a knack for getting the bat on the ball."
Case in point: In 1999, Jeter led the American League with 151 singles. And while they rather shockingly had just one four-hit game that season, they had 67 multi-hit games, which was the most in baseball that year.
The numbers make it difficult to believe Jeter finished so low in the MVP voting in 1999. They would come closer in years when their numbers were not nearly as stellar. They finished third in 1998, behind Texas' Juan Gonzalez and Boston's Nomar Garciaparra, and again in 2009, behind Minnesota's Joe Mauer and Yankees teammate Mark Texiera. In 2006, they came in second behind Minnesota's Justin Morneau.
So while Jeter has been a World Series and All-Star Game MVP, they have never added a season MVP award to their collection. And they seem OK with it.
"I want to win, that's it," Jeter says. "It doesn't get any more complicated than that."
Jeter has certainly won; they have five World Series rings to prove it.
And there's nothing overrated about that.
NORTH HIGHLANDS, Calif. -- An 86-year-old California woman who was sexually assaulted and beaten to death during a morning walk around a high school track hit the attacker with their walking stick to try to fend off the man.
Authorities say Fusako Petrus was killed when they came to the aid of a 61-year-old friend who was the initial target of the attack Wednesday as they exercised on the track near Sacramento.
KCRA reports that family friend Vicki Butler says the man was choking the unidentified younger woman when Fusako started hitting them with their walking stick. This allowed the friend to get away.
Police say an 18-year-old man was arrested later Wednesday in connection with a separate assault several miles away, CBS Sacramento reports.
Sacramento Sheriff's Department spokesperson Sgt. Tony Turnbull on Friday identified the suspect as Neven Glen Butle. Turnbull says homicide detectives tied Butler to the scene of the earlier sexual assaults of Petrus and a 61-year-old friend.
DNA leads police to suspect in alleged jogger killing
"It's really kind of creepy that someone is like out there specifically targeting elderly people," Alex Jullig, who lives in the Arden area, told CBS Sacramento. "It's kind of like out of this world really."
Authorities say Butle attacked three elderly women on Wednesday and was still on-scene when deputies responded to the third attack.
"I always see this neighborhood as on the safer side," Jullig said. "A lot of good people live here and yeah absolutely not I would never expect that to happen here."
CBS Sacramento reports that the arrest location was listed as the Woodside Healthcare Center: a rehabilitation facility.
Turnbull says Butle is being held on suspicion of murder and they will be arraigned in Sacramento Superior Court on Monday.
Over two years ago, the Justice Department and the FBI began a review of thousands of criminal cases to determine if any defendants were wrongfully convicted based on flawed forensic testimony.
The review included 2,600 convictions and 45 death-row cases from the 1980s and 1990s in which the FBI's hair and fiber unit reported a match to a crime-scene sample before DNA testing of hair became common.
On July 10, 2012, Spencer S. Hsu of The Washington Post broke the story:
The undertaking is the largest post-conviction review ever done by the FBI. It will include cases conducted by all FBI Laboratory hair and fiber examiners since at least 1985 and may reach earlier if records are available, people familiar with the process said. Such FBI examinations have taken place in federal and local cases across the country, often in violent crimes, such as rape, murder and robbery. The review comes after The Washington Post reported in April that Justice Department officials had known for years that flawed forensic work might have led to the convictions of potentially innocent people but had not performed a thorough review of the cases. In addition, prosecutors did not notify defendants or their attorneys even in many cases they knew were troubled.
Hsu's April 2012 article covered the stories of two DC men who were convicted largely on the testimony of FBI hair analysts. Both men were wrongly placed at the crime scenes by those analysts:
Santae A. Tribble, now 51, was convicted of killing a taxi driver in 1978, and Kirk L. Odom, now 49, was convicted of a sexual assault in 1981. Since the Post report, Tribble's conviction was vacated, and on Tuesday, prosecutors moved to overturn Odom's conviction and declare them innocent. The Justice Department had not previously reviewed their cases.
The Justice Department said it was going to conduct the more expansive review:
“The Department and the FBI are in the process of identifying historical cases for review where a microscopic hair examination conducted by the FBI was among the evidence in a case that resulted in a conviction,” spokesperson Nanda Chitre said in a statement. “We have dedicated considerable time and resources to addressing these issues, with the goal of reaching final determinations in the coming months.”
Last August, the FBI cut the review short because the agency wasn't happy with the results, which are quite damning – nearly EVERY criminal case reviewed included flawed forensic testimony.
But the agency claims it had other reasons for stopping the research:
According to the FBI, the delay resulted, in part, “from a vigorous debate that occurred within the FBI and DOJ about the appropriate scientific standards we should apply when reviewing FBI lab examiner testimony — many years after the fact.” “Working closely with DOJ, we have resolved those issues and are moving forward with the transcript review for the remaining cases,” the FBI said.
The FBI had reviewed about 160 cases before it stopped. Notification that “FBI examiners exceeded the limits of science” when linking hair to crime-scene evidence were offered for defendants in 23 cases – 14 of which were death-row cases.
Defendants in two more death-row cases and in 134 non-capital cases will be notified about the misconduct over the next month. The DOJ will also complete evaluations of 98 other cases by early October, including 14 more death-row cases.
Previously, the FBI claimed that one rogue examiner named Michael P. Malone was the source of the problems.
But Erin Murphy, a New York University law professor and expert on modern scientific evidence said there is much more involved:
“I see this as a tip-of-the-iceberg problem. It's not as though this is one bad apple or even that this is one bad-apple discipline. There is a long list of disciplines that have exhibited problems, where if you opened up cases you'd see the same kinds of overstated claims and unfounded statements.”
This issue is nothing new – here's a little background and history on the problems with forensic evidence.
Since at least the 1970s, FBI policy has stated that a hair association cannot be used as positive identification, like fingerprints, but that didn't stop agents from regularly testifying to the near-certainty of matches.
In fact, no accepted research exists on how often hair from different people may appear the same. The FBI now uses visual hair comparison to rule out someone as a possible source of hair or as a screening step before more accurate DNA testing.
But that doesn't do much for those convicted based on the faulty science and testimony in the past.
In the 1990s, Dr. Frederic Whitehurst was one of the FBI's top scientists. They were also a whistleblower who bought attention to misconduct and fraud in the agency's crime lab.
Whistleblowersblog.org reports that Dr. Whitehurst's revelations led to the formation of an internal DOJ task force in 1996 to review thousands of impacted cases. But that task force operated in secret, and shut down nearly 10 years ago – without issuing a final report.
CBS News interviewed Dr. Whitehurst after the Justice Department inspector general validated their exposure of lab misconduct.
Here is that interview, which was recorded in 1998.
Despite Dr. Whitehurst's disclosures nearly 20 years ago, the problems they exposed still exist.
In 2009, a National Academy of Sciences panel produced the following findings:
Expert comparisons of hair, handwriting, marks made by firearms on bullets, and patterns such as bite marks and shoe and tire prints are in some ways unscientific and subject to human bias, a National Academy of Sciences panel chartered by Congress found. Other techniques, such as in bullet-lead analysis and arson investigation, survived for decades despite poorly regulated practices and a lack of scientific method. Even fingerprint identification is partly a subjective exercise that lacks research into the role of unconscious bias or even its error rate, the panel's 328-page report said. “The forensic science system, encompassing both research and practice, has serious problems that can only be addressed by a national commitment to overhaul the current structure,” the panel concluded.

Police and law enforcement agencies don't want to relinquish control of their labs, despite failures being cited at every level since 2002:
Failures have been reported at about 30 federal, state and local crime labs serving the FBI, the Army and eight of the nation's 20 largest cities. Advances in DNA testing are exposing errors at unexpected rates. In November, researchers with the Urban Institute reported that new DNA testing appeared to clear convicted defendants in 16 percent of Virginia criminal convictions between 1973 and 1988 in which evidence was available for retesting. A 2009 study of post-conviction DNA exonerations — now up to 289 nationwide — found invalid testimony in more than half the cases. (source)
The number of post-conviction DNA exonerations is now up to 317, according to The Innocence Project. Eighteen of those were death row inmates.
The National Academy of Sciences report cited the lack of effective standards for examiners, laboratories and court testimony. It also criticized Justice Department agencies for a dearth of research into problems and for being “too wedded” to the status quo to be trusted to lead reforms, said Hsu for The Post.
Two weeks ago, the inspector general released a report that revealed more disturbing details about the FBI lab misconduct scandal:
The report said the FBI took more than five years to identify more than 60 death-row defendants whose cases had been handled by 13 lab examiners whose work had been criticized in a 1997 inspector-general investigation. As a result, state authorities could not consider whether to stay sentences, and three men were put to death. One of those defendants, who was executed in Texas in 1997, would not have been eligible for the death penalty without the FBI's flawed work, the report said. “Failures of this nature undermine the integrity of the United States' system of justice and the public's confidence in our system,” the 146-page report stated. The failure to admit errors at the time “also injured the reputation of the FBI and the Department.” (source)
Gross misconduct of this kind really makes you wonder how many innocent people are presently incarcerated – and how many of those people will actually be exonerated. The US has the highest incarceration rate in the world, with nearly 2.4 million Americans currently behind bars.
How many of the 2.4 million don't belong there?

Seeming to offer explanation for why the vessel of Star Trek: Voyager became so irrevocably stranded, Kate Mulgrew—best known as that show's Captain Janeway—has lent their familiar voice to The Principle, an upcoming documentary about the belief that the Earth is the center of the universe. The film has been in the works for a while, though it's mostly been as ignored as those who have propagated the theory of Geocentrism past the 17th century.
But that's all changed with the release of a trailer that finds Mulgrew's familiar voice intoning, “Everything we think we know about our universe is wrong,” before a montage of physicists offers vaguely articulated assessments of how unique our planet is, seemingly in support of the idea that everything must therefore revolve around it. Some of them stand before whiteboards with calculations written on them. The evidence is compelling.
However, one of those physicists, Lawrence Krauss, has already come forward to say they have no idea how they ended up in this stupid Geocentrism documentary. In their Slate article, titled “I Have No Idea How I Ended Up In That Stupid Geocentrism Documentary,” Krauss claims that producers must have taken clips of them that were in the public domain, purchased the rights to them from some other production company, or simply deceived them as to what their project was about—a misrepresentation that they see no need to sue over, lest it “elevate the profile of something that shouldn't even rise to the level of popular discussion.” Unfortunately, Captain Janeway is in it, so here we are.

But according to Mulgrew, they too are misled. In a post on their Facebook page, the actor addressed that discussion, denying any involvement beyond being a hired gun who maybe should have asked a few more questions:
I understand there has been some controversy about my participation in a documentary called THE PRINCIPLE. Let me assure everyone that I completely agree with the eminent physicist Lawrence Krauss, who was themselves misrepresented in the film, and who has written a succinct rebuttal in SLATE. I am not a geocentrist, nor am I in any way a proponent of geocentrism. More importantly, I do not subscribe to anything Robert Sungenis has written regarding science and history and, had I known of their involvement, would most certainly have avoided this documentary. I was a voice for hire, and a misinformed one, at that. I apologize for any confusion that my voice on this trailer may have caused. Kate Mulgrew
Should Mulgrew and Krauss' accusations of misrepresentation be true, they certainly wouldn't be the first levied against The Principle's creator and principal voice, Robert Sungenis, who has spent years arguing for Geocentrism through their website and book, Galileo Was Wrong. (Reviews with randomly capitalized words say, “If Evolution is the Trunk and Limbs of the TREE of LIES about Origins, then Heliocentrism was and is the rotten ROOT and foundation of that Satanically inspired ‘science, falsely so-called.'” Others are somewhat less fervent.) It wouldn't even be the first time Krauss has made one; he's on record as refuting Sungenis as far back as 2006.

Sungenis—who has a Ph.D. in religious studies from “a private distance-learning institution in Republic of Vanuatu”—has used those credentials to establish a career as a leading proponent of Geocentrism, based on an understanding of astrophysics drawn from that most esteemed of scientific manuals, the Bible. In addition to denying anyone can prove the Earth revolves around the sun, he's also well known for denying anyone can prove 6 million Jews died during the Holocaust. He's also claimed that Jews are in league with Satan to take over the planet. Robert Sungenis has a lot of ideas about things.
In The Principle trailer, Sungenis can be seen floating another conspiracy theory—one that posits that everything revolves around Robert Sungenis—saying, “You can go on some websites of NASA to see that they've started to take down stuff that might hint to a Geocentric universe.” Indeed, if you search for Geocentric websites that have been removed, you won't find them; in the absence of evidence, it's your faith that tells you NASA did it.
It's unknown as of yet what sort of theory Sungenis will concoct to explain why even the people in their documentary are immediately decrying it. In the meantime, it remains irrefutable scientific fact that the best Star Trek captain is Jean-Luc Picard.
"That's where it really becomes relevant to Kitchener-Waterloo because this is where BlackBerry is based," Van Houten said.
A spokesperson for BlackBerry would not say how much coltan the company buys annually, but did say the company supports publicly reporting on company activities to prevent the funding of conflict. But that does not mean BlackBerry supports the Just Minerals Campaign or Dewar's private member's bill.
"The voluntary multi-stakeholder initiatives that we have worked on together represent the best opportunity to result in more significant impact on the issue," Rebecca Freiburger said in an email.
They said BlackBerry does not want to abandon central Africa as a source for the minerals.
"As we have demonstrated through our participation in projects such as Solutions for Hope and the Conflict-free Tin Initiative, metals can be verifiably sourced from this region," Freiburger said in an email.
"This supports the livelihoods of many thousands of people," they wrote. "Abandoning the Democratic Republic of the Congo would have severe ramifications for the local population who rely on mining as one source of income."
Tantalum is used to make capacitors that charge circuit boards with electricity. Tin is in the solder that holds the circuit board together. Gold conducts electricity really well. Tungsten has the highest melting point of any metal and is used to make filaments for light bulbs, televisions, aircraft and missiles.
Steven Young, a professor at the University of Waterloo, said the U.S. legislation will force technology companies, starting next year, and the mining firms that supply them, to make public their sources and supply chains.
"So that mechanism for doing reporting is largely being created already," Young said.
That means Dewar's bill should not have an overwhelming financial impact on Canadian technology companies.
Young sits on a committee with the electronics industry assessing the smelters in Africa that converts the minerals to the metals that are used in consumer electronics here. BlackBerry also has someone on that group. It is trying to decide which smelters are legitimate sources for the minerals instead of ones that are funding the purchase of weapons and furthering the conflict.
Young said this initiative by the private sector follows a long list of failures by governments in Africa, the United Nations and interventions in Africa.
"So this is an interesting turn to go to the private sector and say: 'Hey, you guys are buying this stuff, surely you should take some responsibility,'" Young said. "And to their credit they said: 'Yeah, we can see what we can do as well.' "

The longer that I sit with the season four finale of Nathan Fielder's Nathan for You, “Finding Frances,” the less certain I am of how I feel about it. It's unquestionably one of the best TV episodes of the year, definitely the best standalone, and perhaps just as worthy of the argument over what counts as TV and what counts as a movie as the current debate raging over the most recent season of Twin Peaks. It's just as much a meditation on love and the passage of time as Lynch's latest work, and just as impossible to stop thinking about.
Over the course of almost two hours (nearly four times the length of a typical Nathan for You episode), Fielder attempts to reunite a purported Bill Gates impersonator, Bill Heath, with a woman named Frances, who they say is their lost love. The typical Nathan for You hijinks ensue, including pretending to be shooting a sequel to Mud and staging a high school reunion, but that absurdity isn't the predominant thread in “Finding Frances.”
At first glance, the premise could easily be described as sweet. What's sweeter than true love, after all? But the more that we learn about Bill—it seems that they philandered, and attempted to pressure Frances into making their relationship more intimate when they aren't comfortable with it—the more obvious it becomes that, given an unreliable narrator, we may be watching something play out through increasingly uncomfortable rose-colored glasses. When confronted with their past misbehaviors and present lies to Fielder (he isn't a Bill Gates impersonator after all), they deny culpability, or otherwise avoids engaging in any discussion. For the most part, this leaves Fielder baffled.
If you've never seen the show before, the best way to describe the overall tone of it might be, “kind of mean, like funny-mean.” Nathan for You sends Fielder out as a consultant to struggling businesses and struggling people, and the solutions they offer them are invariably bonkers. While “Finding Frances” may now be the most well-known episode of the show (filmmaker Errol Morris wrote about it for The New Yorker, in case you need any idea of the scope of its effect), the prior Nathan for You standard-bearer—and a neat example of the ethos of the show—was “Dumb Starbucks.” In it, Fielder convinced the owner of a coffee shop to turn it into “Dumb Starbucks Coffee,” and to present it as an art installation to prevent any trouble with copyright laws.
As might be obvious, these scenarios usually have Fielder throwing the people he's helping somewhat off-balance. (The Comedy Central show is listed as “cringe comedy” on Wikipedia.) Bill, however, is implacable. As Fielder comes up with gag after gag in an attempt to dig up Frances' whereabouts, Bill goes along with every single one, revealing themselves to be an increasingly complex character along the way.
Their loneliness is palpable—Fielder notes that he'd continued visiting the studio at random intervals after their first appearance on the show in a previous season—and even more so as we see that it's not just us, as an audience, who have been somehow duped. Memory is fallible, and memory tied to emotion even more so. We look upon our past selves with kindness or with contempt, but there's no in-between. Bill lands in the former camp so firmly as to affect their present behavior. When it starts to look like they have a positive lead, they start investing more and more in a fantasy in which she'll leave their current husband to be with him. When Fielder hires an actor to act as a Frances stand-in to rehearse how Bill's eventual reunion with them will go, he's aggressive to a degree that's uncomfortable to watch, putting a hand on the actor's thigh and acting otherwise cavalier. It's only when it's suggested that they take the role of Frances and the actor play Bill that they start to reconsider their behavior.
This is all made even more surreal by a parallel storyline that develops halfway through the episode: Fielder hires an escort named Maci (who is the one who judges Nathan for You to be “funny-mean”) to try to work on Bill's people skills where women are concerned, and when Bill refuses (saying, in a moment that makes it particularly difficult to feel any sympathy towards him, “You gotta know what you're sticking it in,” even though Fielder explains that the meeting is meant to be platonic), Fielder goes to meet Maci on their own.
As the episode progresses, they continue to meet, seeming to get to like each other more and more each time. In case the question of how much of this relationship is manufactured and how much of it is genuine hasn't been driven home, “Finding Frances” closes on a drone shot of them sitting on a bench together, surrounded by the show's crew. Nathan for You may be a docu-reality show, but Fielder is ultimately making a show. And Maci is literally paid to spend time with other people. We're inclined to take the progression of their relationship as real because of the narrative couching, but the entire structure of the show around it throws a wrench into taking things at such a surface level.
It doesn't help that the resolution of Bill's storyline is one that begs a balm. Old dogs may be able to learn new tricks, but the window of time provided by a Nathan for You episode isn't enough to turn around decades' worth of navel-gazing. Bill and Frances' reunion takes place via phone call, as Bill's insistence that the camera crew come to the house with them puts Fielder off, and a call is how they settle the matter. Over the course of an excruciating few minutes, Bill continues to ask Frances, “Doesn't my voice sound familiar to you?” and other leading questions as Frances continues to give them the same answer: “No.” Ultimately, they reveal himself, and their conversation ends with simple well wishes. No promise of any future meetings, no leaving their husband, no real acknowledgment of their shared past.
“The years go by,” Bill says, as they and Fielder sit in their car outside Frances' house. “In the snap of a finger, they go by.” That's that.
There are precious few other shows this year that I can think of that have managed to do so much so subtly, and so effectively. There are endless nettles to pick through when it comes to how we ought to be interpreting the end of the episode, and how much license we should be offering Bill—and Fielder, too—when it comes to their behavior towards others, but it's not enough to discount how remarkable the rest of the episode is. Leading up to the episode's airing, Fielder wrote, “If you only have time to watch one Nathan for You episode this season, tonight's 2-hour finale wouldn't be a bad choice.” I'd take it one step further and say: if you only have time to watch one Nathan for You episode, period, make it “Finding Frances.”
Following on the heels of Cheh's Bicycle and Pedestrian Safety Act, Mayor Bowser has transmitted the Vision Zero Act of 2015 to the Council for their consideration.
This bill does several things geared towards making DC's roads safer.
Like Cheh's bill, it would codify a Complete Streets policy as law It would ban the use of dirt bikes and ATVs on DC streets (I thought this was already the law) It establishes an Ignition Interlock Device Program that repeat offenders or 1-time offenders with particularly high BAC will be required to install. It changes the fines and jail sentences of drunk drivers It Increases the fine for distracted driving from $100 to $500 and adds 2 points
So, not as sweeping as Cheh's bill and the distracted driving part isn't as good as the Mendelsohn's Enhanced Penalties for Distracted Driving Act of 2015, but it represents a growing consensus that safety legislation is needed - specifically with respect to Complete Streets and distracted driving.
Customizing bikes is all about seeing potential. Case in point: this cute little '92 Suzuki GN250 from Portugal's Dream Wheels Heritage.
Back in the day, the GN was the go-to bike for riding schools and the Portuguese postal service. But this one's been resurrected as a neat-n-tidy café racer, for delivering smiles around the island of Madeira.
Dream Wheels' client specifically wanted a bike with a traditional café look—but it's the impeccable execution that has us sold.
Take a look at the beautifully matched upper bodywork, for example. The tank has been adapted from a Sachs Lotus Special V5—a 50cc Portuguese bike made in the 80s.
The seat hump is actually a removable hand-made cover, with passenger accommodations below. It's perched on a custom-made subframe, with a discreet LED taillight built into the seat pan.
The front fender and rear license plate bracket are hand-made, as is the new battery box. There's a new gel battery in there too. For the exhaust, Dream Wheels combined two EMGO mufflers—connected to the headers via a one-off branch.
The GN250's also had a serious under-the-hood refresh. The engine's been rebuilt from the ground up, and treated to a fresh coat of paint. Smaller items—like the brake lines and fork boots—have all been replaced.
There's a set of Showa shocks out the back, taken off a Honda CB750. The front forks have been dropped a little to adjust the stance, and the 18” front and 16” rear wheels are running Avon Safety Mileage MKII tires.
Up front is a set of clubman bars, kitted with Biltwell Inc. Kung Fu grips. The headlight is classically styled, but LED-equipped. There's a new mini-speedo too—wrapped in leather, with a vintage Portuguese escudo coin embedded in the side for luck.
It's a timeless aesthetic, finished off in an equally timeless color. Dream Wheels picked Mini Copper Hot Chocolate for the paint reference. It's been done in a matte finish with gold touches—including the owner's luck number, 19.
“We see a lot of custom bikes with this base,” Dream Wheels' Hélder Moura tells us. “It is cheaper, and has simple mechanics.”
“But we think that we improved it, and moved it to another level.”
From forgotten delivery bike to perfect Mediterranean runabout… sounds like a pretty big improvement to us.

Two recent comments underscore the crisis in modern economies, a critical situation that is at the heart of the sluggish global economy and that could, if not corrected, lead to an ever uglier political environment. The blame for the mess we are in lies with John Maynard Keynes.
The head of the IMF , Christine Lagarde, recently warned that falling prices are threatening a fragile recovery: "With inflation running below many central banks' targets, we see rising risks of deflation, which could prove disastrous for the recovery." Them concern echoes that of the European Central Bank head, Mario Draghi, who spoke around the same time about deflation risks and declared that the ECB will remain "accommodative."
Classical economists going back to Adam Smith have regarded the production of products and services as the "real economy" and money and credit as the "symbol economy." In other words, money reflects what people are doing in the marketplace. Money and credit are tools of commerce. Keynes turned that thinking on its head, audaciously asserting that money and credit are the real drivers of the economy. Control money and you control the production of products and services. To classical economists this is like stating that the sun rises in the West and sets in the East. But thanks to the Great Depression, Keynes' heresy became orthodoxy. Monetarism is a Keynesian offspring.
Keynes famously observed: "Practical men, who believe themselves to be quite exempt from any intellectual influences, are usually slaves of some defunct economist." Unfortunately too many government officials and economists, while not pretending to be exempt from ideas, are today slaves of Keynes' misguided monetary notions. Hence the current orthodoxy: Pump out enough money, and all will be well. The impact of high tax rates, regulations that hamper enterprise and gum up the flexibility of labor markets, and bloated public sectors, which absorb and waste resources that could be productively put to work for everyone's benefit by businesspeople and investors, are downplayed or ignored.
What Keynes posited was the equivalent of saying that manipulating scales is the way to attack obesity. Money is a measure of value. Like a clock or ruler, it has little or no intrinsic value. Its function is to facilitate commerce.
Completely alien to today's finance ministers, central bankers and most economists is the idea that money works best when it has a stable value.
The "deflation" that worries so many of today's economic worthies is actually a reflection of a still sluggish economic environment, which, in turn, is in no small part attributable to credit markets that have been warped by the suppression of interest rates. When the price of borrowing money is distorted, the financing of productive commerce is hindered.
Vibrant economies, not central banks, create real money, and wealth is abundantly created when tax rates are low, money is stable and regulations are reasonable.

These almond butter noodles are deliciously creamy, quick and easy to make, and packed with a rainbow of veggies. I used soba noodles for this vegan recipe but it works equally well with udon, rice noodles, zoodles or even simple spaghetti. This quick recipe is ready in just 15 minutes and costs $1.84 per serving.
This recipe is a great option of a quick weeknight dinner when you're craving something fresh, filling and tasty but just have a couple of minutes to spare for dinner. Almond butter noodles are a great alternative to peanut butter noodles with a lighter flavour that allows the deliciousness of the veggies and the nuttiness of the soba noodles to shine through.
One money-saving tip that I often hear from other vegans on a budget is to make your own nut butters. I'm not entirely convinced that it's cheaper to buy whole nuts rather than nut butters, which are made with the cheaper, broken nuts, I guess it totally depends on where you shop and the best price you can get on nuts.
In my case, I can't buy almond butter where I live and I can get a kilo of almond for $14.00 at the Asian market, which I think is a pretty good price. So for this recipe I had no choice but to use my own homemade almond butter, which I calculated out to be $2.09 for the half cup I used in the recipe, although you may be able to get a better price than me if you buy a jar of prepared almond butter.
The almond butter sauce is so simple to make; it's simply almond butter, soy sauce, lime juice and a touch of sugar. You can add a bit of sriracha, sambal or red chili flakes if you want a spicy kick. Toss the sauce with your veggies and noodle of choice.
I had a hard time deciding between soba and udon, and they're both $1.35 for a package at the Asian market. I went with soba for its nutty flavour but any kind of noodle or pasta would work great in this recipe.
Choose your veggies. This is another great clean-out-the-fridge recipe, anything goes! I used broccoli, spiralized carrot and red pepper, red onion and a sprinkling of green onions on top. A quick stir-fry on the veggies, toss the noodles and sauce together in the pan and dinner's done in just 15 minutes!
These almond butter noodles are delicious served both hot and cold so if you've got any leftovers, take them to work for lunch the next day. You don't even need to heat them up!
Got leftovers? Use them in these recipes:
Carrot, red onion: Raw vegan noodles salad
Carrot, green onion: Tofu banh mi vegan sliders
Red pepper: Vegetarian enchilada soup

NEW YORK (CBSNewYork) – A massive brawl erupted late Friday night at a casino in Queens.
As CBS2's Ilana Gold reported, hundreds of people at the World Resorts Casino in Ozone Park saw the fight and began recording it on their cellphones. Now, the video is going viral.
“Didn't really see much of people calling the cops, you just see people trying to get footage of it,” witness Jermaine Carry told 1010 WINS' Darius Radzius.
In the video, taken around 10:30 p.m., people are seen hurling chairs across the food court and throwing punches as innocent bystanders try to run out and avoid injury.
Carry told the Associated Press some line-cutting sparked ire as hundreds of people waited to buy daiquiris at a new Fat Tuesday bar. They said then it was “like a wild frat party gone wrong.”
“All I remember was it was chairs flying everywhere, it was chaotic. It was too much going on at one time a lot of people were there, the line was ridiculously long,” witness Elize Brown said.
9/11 verdict is 'US propaganda for waging war on Iran'
A US court has won a default judgement that Iranian officials, including its supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, provided help to the 9/11 hijackers behind the worst terror attack on American soil. The lawsuit was filed by the families of the atrocity's victims. There was no Iranian representation in court. RT talks to Michel Chossudovsky, Director of the Center for Research on Globalization.
http://youtu.be/uGHdePe4GZM
Director of the Center for Research on Globalization Michel Chossudovsky has told RT that calling Iran's officials - including the supreme leader - guilty of helping the 9/11 attackers is nothing but “a ploy.”
On Thursday, families of victims of the September 11th 2001 attacks won a default judgment against Iran, the Taliban, Al-Qaeda and Lebanon-based Hezbollah. According to the lawsuit, people in Iran – including Ayatollah Ali Khamenei- provided support to the terrorists who went on to attack civilians on US soil.But Mr. Chossudovsky told RT they believe it's nothing but a cover-up, with Iran as a convenient fall guy.
“There is absolutely no evidence that Iran aided the 9/11 attacks. There is ample evidence after collection that there was conspiracy and the complicity of the US government…There is absolutely no evidence that Al Qaeda or the Taliban were involved in the 9/11 attacks. In fact, if there is anyone behind Al Qaeda, it was the Central Intelligence Agency, going back to the Soviet Afghan war”, Chossudovsky said.
And this latest court ruling is part of the plan, according to Chossudovsky. “We are dealing with fabrications whereby a war agenda, which has been on the Pentagon's drawing board for many years, is now seeking justification to go live – and we've seen the drone attacks, we've seen the sanctions.”
But why would the United States get involved in such a long-running, costly, dangerous ploy? The answer, according to the Canadian analyst, is simple.
“Because Iran has 10 per cent of the world's oil reserves – four or five times the amount of the United States; it's in a crucial region, it doesn't accept US hegemony and it's an ally of Russia and China.”
However, Chossudovsky told RT, the consequences of such a move could be disastrous. “It could unleash a war which extends from the eastern Mediterranean right through to Central Asia to the Chinese border – and then we are in a World War III scenario.”
Iran, Hezbollah Also Responsible for 9/11, Rules Federal Judge
A handful of new stars are born each year in the Milky Way, while many more blink on across the universe. But astronomers have observed that galaxies should be churning out millions more stars, based on the amount of interstellar gas available.
Now researchers from MIT, Columbia University, and Michigan State University have pieced together a theory describing how clusters of galaxies may regulate star formation. They describe their framework this week in the journal Nature.
When intracluster gas cools rapidly, it condenses, then collapses to form new stars. Scientists have long thought that something must be keeping the gas from cooling enough to generate more stars — but exactly what has remained a mystery.
For some galaxy clusters, the researchers say, the intracluster gas may simply be too hot — on the order of hundreds of millions of degrees Celsius. Even if one region experiences some cooling, the intensity of the surrounding heat would keep that region from cooling further — an effect known as conduction.
“It would be like putting an ice cube in a boiling pot of water — the average temperature is pretty much still boiling,” says Michael McDonald, a Hubble Fellow in MIT's Kavli Institute for Astrophysics and Space Research. “At super-high temperatures, conduction smooths out the temperature distribution so you don't get any of these cold clouds that should form stars.”
For so-called “cool core” galaxy clusters, the gas near the centre may be cool enough to form some stars. However, a portion of this cooled gas may rain down into a central black hole, which then spews out hot material that serves to reheat the surroundings, preventing many stars from forming — an effect the team terms “precipitation-driven feedback.”
“Some stars will form, but before it gets too out of hand, the black hole will heat everything back up — it's like a thermostat for the cluster,” McDonald says. “The combination of conduction and precipitation-driven feedback provides a simple, clear picture of how star formation is governed in galaxy clusters.”
Crossing a galactic threshold
Throughout the universe, there exist two main classes of galaxy clusters: cool core clusters — those that are rapidly cooling and forming stars — and non-cool core clusters — those have not had sufficient time to cool.
The Coma cluster, a non-cool cluster, is filled with gas at a scorching 100 million degrees Celsius. To form any stars, this gas would have to cool for several billion years. In contrast, the nearby Perseus cluster is a cool core cluster whose intracluster gas is a relatively mild several million degrees Celsius. New stars occasionally emerge from the cooling of this gas in the Perseus cluster, though not as many as scientists would predict.
“The amount of fuel for star formation outpaces the amount of stars 10 times, so these clusters should be really star-rich,” McDonald says. “You really need some mechanism to prevent gas from cooling, otherwise the universe would have 10 times as many stars.”
McDonald and their colleagues worked out a theoretical framework that relies on two anti-cooling mechanisms.
The group calculated the behaviour of intracluster gas based on a galaxy cluster's radius, mass, density, and temperature. The researchers found that there is a critical temperature threshold below which the cooling of gas accelerates significantly, causing gas to cool rapidly enough to form stars.
According to the group's theory, two different mechanisms regulate star formation, depending on whether a galaxy cluster is above or below the temperature threshold. For clusters that are significantly above the threshold, conduction puts a damper on star formation: The surrounding hot gas overwhelms any pockets of cold gas that may form, keeping everything in the cluster at high temperatures.
“For these hotter clusters, they're stuck in this hot state, and will never cool and form stars,” McDonald says. “Once you get into this very high-temperature regime, cooling is really inefficient, and they're stuck there forever.”
For gas at temperatures closer to the lower threshold, it's much easier to cool to form stars. However, in these clusters, precipitation-driven feedback starts to kick in to regulate star formation: While cooling gas can quickly condense into clouds of droplets that can form stars, these droplets can also rain down into a central black hole — in which case the black hole may emit hot jets of material back into the cluster, heating the surrounding gas back up to prevent further stars from forming.
“In the Perseus cluster, we see these jets acting on hot gas, with all these bubbles and ripples and shockwaves,” McDonald says. “Now we have a good sense of what triggered those jets, which was precipitating gas falling onto the black hole.”
On track
McDonald and their colleagues compared their theoretical framework to observations of distant galaxy clusters, and found that their theory matched the observed differences between clusters. The team collected data from the Chandra X-ray Observatory and the South Pole Telescope — an observatory in Antarctica that searches for far-off massive galaxy clusters.
The researchers compared their theoretical framework with the gas cooling times of every known galaxy cluster, and found that clusters filtered into two populations — very slowly cooling clusters, and clusters that are cooling rapidly, closer to the rate predicted by the group as a critical threshold.
By using the theoretical framework, McDonald says researchers may be able to predict the evolution of galaxy clusters, and the stars they produce.
“We've built a track that clusters follow,” McDonald says. “The nice, simple thing about this framework is that you're stuck in one of two modes, for a very long time, until something very catastrophic bumps you out, like a head-on collision with another cluster.”
The researchers hope to look deeper into the theory to see whether the mechanisms regulating star formation in clusters also apply to individual galaxies. Preliminary evidence, they say, suggests that is the case.
“If we can use all this information to understand why or why not stars form around us, then we've made a big step forward,” McDonald says.
“[These results] look very promising,” says Paul Nulsen, an astronomer at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics who was not involved in this research. “More work will be needed to show conclusively that precipitation is the main source of the gas that powers feedback. Other processes in the feedback cycle also need to be understood. For example, there is still no consensus on how the gas falling into a massive black hole produces energetic jets, or how they inhibit cooling in the remaining gas. This is not the end of the story, but it is an important insight into a problem that has proved a lot more difficult than anyone ever anticipated.”

The thief, who appeared to be in their early 50s, flashed a black pistol and demanded cash from a teller at the Chase Bank branch office in the 600 block of Lomas Santa Fe Drive in Solana Beach shortly before 2:30 p.m., sheriff's Lt. Jim Walker said.
After the clerk handed over an undisclosed amount of money, the bandit fled the area to the south on a bicycle, the lieutenant said.
Witnesses described the robber as a roughly 6-foot-2-inch, 180-pound white man with a beard that might have been false, acne-scarred reddish cheeks and dreadlocks. They were dressed in jeans and a brown jacket, Walker said.

Here we consider the seven stages of monitoring investments throughout life.
The seven ages of man is a speech from one of Shakespeare's plays and catalogues the stages we go through in life, from baby to old age. It is an excellent comparison to investing and how investors need to ensure their investments keep pace with them as they move through life. However, this doesn't just apply to saving for retirement, it applies to any investment goal and portfolios need to be monitored to make sure they are on track to achieve their objective.
Baby to young adult: Although financial commitments are negligible at this stage in life, it is a good idea to encourage children to save for themselves and to understand the basics of money from an early age.
Under 25: Retirement is a long way and a bulk of an individual's income may be earmarked to fund their current lifestyle – buying property or cars for example – rather than saving for later years. However it is still a good idea to get started in investing and understanding what it is all about. Now also might be a good time to develop a high risk, aggressive portfolio as there is plenty of time to recover from any capital losses.
25 to 35: Although retirement may still seem a long time away, the earlier someone starts investing, the greater chance they have of building a significant nest egg for later years. At this stage in life people may be able to afford higher risk and more aggressive growth strategies as there is more time for investments to recover from losses or market volatility.
Read
35 to 45: Family obligations and expenses may be increasing at this stage in life. Saving for medium to long term goals such as retirement, a child's education or wedding may require investments that seek capital growth. More immediate goals such as paying for school fees or a mortgage may require investments that require a regular income. Therefore a balance between capital growth and income is a sensible idea and at this stage of life, however, a higher level of investment risk may still be acceptable.
45 to 55: At this stage with retirement not too far away, capital protection may be a greater concern for an investor. It might be time to move towards a more conservative or medium to lower risk portfolio. This will help to cushion capital if equity markets experience sudden market volatility.
Over 55: At this stage there is less time to recover from any capital losses and the bulk of any portfolio should be in low risk investments wit a high degree of capital security. This may also be a time to look at investments that offer income as opposed to capital growth.
Retirement: Capital preservation is key to ensure that a lump sum is kept secure to enable it to provide income during retirement. Low risk portfolios with a high degree of capital security may be preferred at this time, as may investments that provide income.

Mr. Ray, who maintained that their only role in the assassination was to buy the murder weapon and give it to a man named ''Raoul,'' later said Mr. Foreman had pressured them into pleading guilty by saying they were 99 percent certain Mr. Ray would go to the electric chair if they faced a jury in Tennessee.
Until they took the Ray case, Mr. Foreman was most famous for a case they did not handle at all. Jack Ruby, shortly after they shot Lee Harvey Oswald, asked that Mr. Foreman represent him. But Mr. Ruby's family objected to what it considered Mr. Foreman's excessive fee. ''Ruby's family was quoted a figure which happened to be four times higher than the fee I had actually asked,'' Mr. Foreman said later, ''and they turned it down. I don't know how something like that happened, but it did.'' Appeals for Help
As one of the nation's best known criminal lawyers, they were constantly bombarded with appeals for help and built their practice on an unshakable loyalty to clients. ''They may not always be right, but they are never wrong,'' they once said.
It was Mr. Foreman, however, who invariably became the center of attention. In court, they were a figure to ridicule, eschewing conservative pinstripes for attention-getting black-and-white plaid sports jackets and bow ties. As they sat at the defense table, wisps of their iron-gray hair would tumble over their forehead, and as they shuffled papers, they sometimes seemed disorganized. But opponents soon learned that they were not.
Mr. Foreman combined a shrewd legal mind and a mastery of tactics, vitriol and unabashed showmanship. Defending a woman who had killed their husband after they flogged them with a whip, Mr. Foreman picked up the whip from the evidence table and cracked it repeatedly during closing arguments. Son of a Sheriff
They were a Baptist deacon, but a colleague once said that in addressing juries Mr. Foreman was as likely to quote Playboy magazine as the Bible. Some opponents questioned their tactics and their concept of justice. ''The only justice they know,'' one former adversary said in 1964, ''is get 'em off and get their money.''
Mr. Foreman was born June 21, 1902, the son of a sheriff who lived in a log cabin near the east Texas town of Cold Springs. Their first job, at age 8, was as a shoeshine boy in nearby Livingston.

They quit school when they were 15, because, they said, ''I knew everything they could teach me.'' They took correspondence courses and, with $6,000 cash in their pocket and their mother's advice that 'law would be my best bet,'' entered the University of Texas Law School. Dancers and Bell Ringers
Mr. Foreman spent much of their time in law school on the Chautauqua circuit, where they shared platforms in small towns with Cossack dancers and Swiss bell ringers and gave talks on ''The High Mission of Women in the 20th Century'' and ''How to Get the Most Out of Life.''
It was good training for court. ''If you didn't talk for two and a half hours, people thought they were cheated,'' Mr. Foreman said. They served briefly as an assistant county prosecutor before going into private practice. For years they kept the $5 bill they received as the fee for their first legal case, drawing up a lease on a five-acre orchard. Their wife, Marguerite, died in 1979. Survivors include a son, William, of Galveston; a daughter, Marguerite, of Huntsville; a brother, Keith, of Austin, and two sisters.
Services were tentatively set for Mondat at Settegast-Kopf Funeral Home, said Mike DeGeurin, one of Mr. Foreman's partners.
So this post offers some cross-country evidence about the empirical link between unionisation and inequality. All data are taken from the OECD. The inequality measure is the Gini coefficient, which means that this post has nothing to say about 'top end' income concentration. (See here for why I think the distinction is important.)
One of the things that I notice in that chart is that countries that are reputed to have strong union movements have market inequality outcomes that don't appear to be all that much better than those with weaker union movements.
I've looked at graphs like this many times over the past few years:
Here are union densities (percentage of workers who are members of a union) plotted against Gini coefficients:
You can see a negative relationship between union membership and inequality, but there are a couple of reasons why you'd be skeptical about drawing a line through that scatter plot. The first is that Iceland would play a larger role that one would think it should. Secondly, what is going on with France and a union density that is less than the US? You hear a lot about the weakening power of unions in the US, but not really so much in France.
It turns out that while union density is low in France, the share of workers covered by collective agreements is high. It seems to me that union coverage - the share of workers who are covered by collective agreements - is a better measure of union influence than union density:
I don't see much of a link between union coverage and inequality there.
Those two graphs are in levels, but the story of the last 20 years or so has been about changes in inequality. If higher unionisation doesn't necessarily mean lower levels of inequality, may it leads to smaller increases in inequality. Unfortunately, the OECD only have long time series data for Gini coefficients for only a handful of coutries.
(The 1990 numbers for Finland and Norway are the averages for 1986 and 1995.) With a couple of exceptions - the Netherlands and New Zealand - the patterns of changes are roughly similar. Here are the *changes* in the Gini coeffiencts since 1990 plotted against *levels* of unionisation in 1990:
Looking at those two charts, it's hard to tell a story in which a strong union presence significantly attenuated increases in inequality.
At this point, it's worth asking why we would expect a stronger union presence to be associated with more equal market outcomes in the first place. I don't think there's much doubt that unions would be a force for equality *within* a given occupation. But it's less obvious that increased unionisation would reduce the earnings gaps between different occupations.
There's a 2004 NBER paper by David Card, Thomas Lemieux and Craig Riddell that looks at the relationship between changes in unionisation and changes in inequality in Canada, the US and the UK. They find that the 'within-group' effect dominates the 'between-group' effect for men, but not for women. This is broadly consistent with the OECD data on changes in unionisation and changes in equality in those three countries: union densities and coverage fell and Gini coefficients increased.
Union densities fell in the countries in this graph, and with exceptions of the Netherlands and New Zealand (in which union density fell by some 40 percentage points), inequality increased:
But things are less clear when you plot changes in union coverage against changes in the Gini coefficient:
Increases in inequality were accompanied by declines in union coverage in Canada, the US, the UK and some other countries. But similar increases in inequality were accompanied by increased union coverage in Sweden, Norway and Finland.
I don't really see much of a link - either in theory or in the data - between unionisation rates and increases in inequality across occupations. (Inequality within an occupation is a different story.)
WebVR is now available in Chrome Canary!
Previously there were custom, experimental builds of Chromium hosted here that gave developers early access to WebVR on Windows. Hovewer, they were severely outdated and had known security issues.
At this point you can get better, faster, safer access to WebVR on Windows with the official Chrome releases, version 65+ (Available in Canary builds as of their writing).
In order to enable access to the WebVR APIs in the official Chrome builds you must select the "Enabled" option from the drop-down menu for the "Enable WebVR" flag (enter chrome://flags/#enable-webvr in the URL bar) and the "Gamepad Extensions" flag (enter chrome://flags/#enable-gamepad-extensions in the URL bar) and the "OpenVR Hardware Support" flag (enter chrome://flags/#openvr in the URL bar)

It's been 25 years since Toejam and Earl first stormed the console scene, however last year's successfully-funded Kickstarter is finally bringing the hip hopping extraterrestrial duo to the modern age. Dubbed Back in the Groove, designer Greg Johnson and studio Humanature have now announced a partnership with off-the-wall US cable network Adult Swim that'll see the pair land their Rapmaster Rocketship once again in 2017.
To mark the occasion, Humanature teased the game's first slice of in-game footage:

Nearly six in ten Americans want Congress to continue working on health care reform bills that have been passed through various committees, according to a new CNN poll.
Washington (CNN) - Nearly six in ten Americans want Congress to continue working on health care reform bills that have been passed through various committees, according to a new national poll.
Full results (pdf)
Fifty-nine percent of people questioned in a CNN/Opinion Research Corporation survey say lawmakers should continue working on the legislation, a rise of 6 points since August. But only a quarter say those bills should be passed pretty much as is, with a third suggesting that Congress should make major changes. The poll also indicates that one in four say lawmakers should start from scratch and 15 percent want Congress to stop all work on health care reform.
The survey's release Friday morning comes one day before the full House of Representatives is expected to hold a floor vote on the Democrats health care reform bill.
"Most of the Democrats interviewed support some form of heath care reform, but the divisions within congressional Democrats are reflected in the party nationwide," says CNN Polling Director Keating Holland. "Forty percent of the Democratic rank and file want Congress to approve the proposals that have passed through committee with only minor changes. But an equal number of Democrats nationwide want Congress to make major changes to those proposals before approving them."
According to the poll, 45 percent support President Barack Obama's proposals to reform health care, with 53 percent opposed to their plans. This is the first time since the president's early September prime time address a joint session of Congress on health care that a majority of people questioned in a CNN survey oppose Obama's proposals.
"Six in ten independents say they oppose Obama's health care proposals," says Holland. "That's a nine point increase since October."
The House bill that faces a probable Saturday vote contains a version of the public option, an insurance option administered by the federal government that would compete with plans offered by private insurance companies. According to the poll, 55 percent support the public option, with 44 percent opposed.
Rising health care costs could be a factor in support for Congress to take action.
"The appetite for some version of health care reform may be explained by the fact that 55 percent of Americans with health insurance say that their insurance company has raised rates, deductibles or co-payments within the past year," says Holland.
No House Republicans are expected to vote Saturday for the Democrats health care bill.
"With any health care bill likely to face near-unanimous opposition from the GOP, only one in three Americans say that the Republicans in Congress are doing enough to cooperate with Barack Obama. Is Obama doing enough to reach out to Republicans? Half say yes; half say no," adds Holland.
The CNN/Opinion Research Corporation poll was conducted October 30-November 1, with 1,018 adult Americans questioned by telephone. The survey's sampling error is plus or minus 3 percentage points.

Pilots' Lives Defy Glamorous Stereotype
Alex Lapointe, a 25-year-old co-pilot for a regional airline, says they routinely lift off knowing they have gotten less sleep than they need. And once or twice a week, they say, they see the captain next to them struggling to stay alert.
Neil A. Weston, also 25, went $100,000 into debt to train for a co-pilot's job that pays them $25,000 annually. They carry sandwiches in a cooler from their home in Dubuque, Iowa, bought their first uniform for $400, and holds out hope of tripling their salary by moving into the captain's seat, then up to a major carrier. Assuming, that is, the majors start hiring again.
Capt. Paul Nietz, 58, who recently retired from a regional airline, said their schedule wore them down and cost them three marriages. Their workweek typically began with a 2:30 a.m. wake-up in northern Michigan and a 6 a.m. flight to their Chicago home bases. There, they would wait for their first assignment, a noon departure.
By the time they parked their aircraft at the last gate of the night, they were exhausted. But they would be due back at work eight hours and 15 minutes later. “At the very most, if you're the kind of person that could walk into a hotel room, strip and lay down, you might get four and a half hours of sleep,” they said. “And I was very senior. I was one of the fortunate guys.”
The National Transportation Safety Board's inquiry into the Feb. 12 crash of Continental Connection Flight 3407 outside Buffalo [top] has highlighted the operations of the nation's regional airlines, a sector of the aviation industry that has grown to account for half the country's airline flights and a quarter of its passengers.
The details of that world have surprised many Americans — the strikingly low pay for new pilots; the rigors of flying multiple flights, at lower altitudes and thus often in worse weather than pilots on longer routes, while scrambling to get enough sleep; the relative inexperience of pilots at the smaller airlines, whose training standards are the same, but whose skills may not be.
In hearings last week in Washington, witnesses and safety officials raised questions of whether the crew of the plane that crashed, killing all 49 people on board and one on the ground, had been adequately vetted and whether they might have been hampered by, among other factors, fatigue.
But regardless of whether training, fatigue or the cost-cutting that has hit the entire industry are ultimately determined to have contributed to the crash of Flight 3407, interviews with current and former regional pilots make vividly clear the daily challenges they face.
Peek inside a crew lounge at midnight in Chicago, and one could easily find every recliner occupied by an off-duty aviator trying to sleep despite the whine of a janitor's vacuum cleaner.
In any city with a sizable air hub, a search of Craigslist for the term “crash pad” will turn up listings for rooms for rent, often for $200 a month or less, a short drive from an airport, where a dozen or more pilots, unable to afford hotels, may come and go, barely letting the mattresses cool.
But many regional pilots, paid entry-level wages that are sometimes no better than a job at McDonald's, can not afford even a crash pad.
“I know a guy who bought a car that barely ran and parked it in the employee lot at their base airport, and slept in their car six or seven times a month,” said Frank R. Graham Jr., a former regional pilot and airline safety director who runs a safety consulting firm in Charlotte, N.C. Pilots for some regional airlines have been known to sleep in the aisles of their planes.
Like the two Flight 3407 pilots, who caught free rides on planes from Florida and Seattle to their flight from Newark to Buffalo, pilots at regional airlines routinely hopscotch across thousands of miles to get to work. Some live with their parents, as the plane's first officer, Rebecca L. Shaw, did. Others, like Mr. Lapointe, live near former bases of operations that were shut down because an employer went out of business or a route was dropped.
Mr. Lapointe lives in Wakefield, Mass., 15 minutes from their old base in Boston. Since November, they have had to get themselves to Kennedy International Airport in New York.
For Captain Nietz, a 27-year veteran, the biggest indignity was flying hungry. Delays were so routine that they seldom left their plane all day long, even “to grab a biscuit.” With food service long discontinued, they said, the only bites to be had been “the occasional peanut — and the airlines charge the crews for bags of peanuts and cheese and crackers.”
The renewed worries over commuter planes come as passenger airlines, regional and mainline, have achieved unprecedented levels of safety. Passenger deaths per million flights are down by more than two-thirds in the last 10 years. The 49 people on board the Buffalo flight were the first in 30 months to die during a scheduled flight on a passenger carrier.
But of the six scheduled passenger flights that have crashed since Sept. 11, 2001, only one has been from a major carrier. Four, including the one in Buffalo, were commuter flights; a total of 133 people died on those flights. (The fifth, a 50-year-old seaplane in Miami, was in neither category.)
And one of the worries about commuter pilots, fatigue, is also a problem for the mainline carriers; in fact, in some operations, the big airlines are more vulnerable. They are now conducting flights of 16 hours, across more time zones than a pilot can be expected to adapt to.
Senator Bryron L. Dorgan, Democrat of North Dakota, who is chairperson of the subcommittee on aviation, said Thursday that the group would hold a series of hearings next month. They said they were “stunned” by the Buffalo crew's lack of sleep and relative inexperience.
“We need to understand, is this an aberration, or are standards sufficiently lax or insufficient, or insufficiently enforced that we need to be concerned about a much broader set of issues?” they said.
There is nothing wrong with commuting cross-country to fly, said Roger Cohen, the president of the Regional Airline Association, a trade group; after all, they pointed out, Capt. Chesley B. Sullenberger III, the US Airways pilot who ditched their crippled Airbus A320 in the Hudson River on Jan. 15, lives in Danville, Calif., and is based in Charlotte, N.C.
Mr. Cohen said they did not know what fraction of pilots commuted long distances to the city where they were, in airline parlance, “domiciled.”
“Anywhere from 50 to 70 percent, pick a number,” they said. But they said they did not think that number differed much between regional carriers and mainline carriers.
The Federal Aviation Administration, while it enforces one set of safety standards, says it does not know how the safety of the commuter airlines compares to the safety of the big carriers. It is working on that question because of the planned Senate hearings.
To the extent that Senator Dorgan's hearings address pilot fatigue, they will not be the first such effort. In 1995, under pressure from the National Transportation Safety Board and the Air Line Pilots Association, the F.A.A. proposed shortening pilots' workdays and redefining duty hours to include the time spent getting from plane to hotel and back.
But the airlines, which deny that pilot fatigue is a significant problem, opposed the changes, and the agency eventually backed off.
Patrick Smith, an airline pilot and aviation writer who spent years at a regional carrier, acknowledged that fatigue is a murky problem, with many causes and varying effects on different pilots, that is difficult to nail down as the main cause of an accident.
“But the fact that you can't make this easy and direct link isn't reason to ignore the problem,” they said. “Obviously it's there.”
For Mr. Weston, the 25-year-old pilot from Dubuque, life in the regional air business is a little like being an extra in a movie. The planes they fly some days are labeled United Connection, others Delta Express. But their employer is an airline few people have ever heard of: Republic.
It is a quick hop by air but a six-hour drive from home to their base in Indianapolis, where they stay overnight with an aunt before starting their four-day workweek. Their workdays run 12 hours, sometimes 16, far from home.
They said this really was a dream job for them and many of their fellow pilots, even though some have to hold down second jobs.
Asked if they flew for pleasure, they laughed.
“I can't afford it,” they said.

The Scary Skies
Frightening revelations at hearings on crash of Continental Connection Flight 3407
Aviation experts say that airplane crashes are usually the result of a collection of failures. After three days of hearings last week into the crash of Buffalo-bound Continental Connection Flight 3407 on the snowy night of Feb. 12, we know that the frightening failures began long before the doomed turboprop plane took off from Newark, N.J. The details that emerged should make even the most experienced air traveler nervous.
Capt. Marvin Renslow, 47, listed just one of the three times they failed a critical pilot test when applying for a job with Colgan Air, the operator of the crashed airliner. They failed twice more after they were hired. First Officer Rebecca Shaw, 24, had gone 36 hours without proper rest (regulations require eight hours of rest before flying) by commuting from their home in Seattle on two flights. The hearings revealed that 78 of the 137 Newark-based pilots for Colgan had commutes ranging from more than 400 miles to more than 1,000 miles. Both Mr. Renslow and Ms. Shaw apparently violated company rules by sleeping in the crew lounge at the Newark airport. So low were their wages that they each had at one time held side jobs while working for the airline. Mr. Renslow ($55,000) stocked grocery shelves in a store near their Tampa home; Ms. Shaw ($16,200) worked in a coffee shop.
The problems in the cockpit were astounding. Cockpit voice recorders picked up Mr. Renslow and Ms. Shaw chitchatting about their lives and careers, in violation of federal regulations that prohibit nonessential conversation below 10,000 feet. They were on their final approach to Buffalo Niagara International Airport in the middle of a snowstorm when Ms. Shaw said, "I've never seen icing conditions. I've never de-iced. . . . I've never experienced any of that." They were oblivious to the ice buildup on the plane's wings and to the rapid decline in airspeed. Only the shaking of the pilot's yoke got Mr. Renslow's attention. But instead of allowing the plane to descend to pick up speed, they yanked the nose of the aircraft up. The plane crashed seconds later, killing all 49 on board and one person on the ground.
Regional air carriers are an essential part of American air travel. According to the Regional Airline Association, about half the scheduled flights in the United States are flown by them, and 74 percent of the nation's airports are served only by regional airlines. The association says that its members must meet the same safety standards for training, maintenance and flight operations that the Federal Aviation Administration sets for large commercial airlines. But as last week's hearings made horrifically clear, there's a gap between what is supposed to be and what is. Considering that the past five crashes of commercial passenger aircraft in this country have all been of regional carriers, we hope that the shocking testimony leads to increased vigilance that will close that gap.

Taking into account my ever increasing fears of airplane travel, this was SO NOT what I wanted to read. But thanks anyway.

Wow! Commuter planes scare me almost as much as the ad currently running on this page!
Note: I have nothing against Scientology any more than any other cult. Attending both wacky Buddhist Sanghas and Quaker meetings...I'm probably as much of a cult member as any one else...but if we don't call out the other cults, we would be doing our own a disservice!

Everyone in public life, it seems, is complaining about the questions they're being asked.
Newt Gingrich rips a Fox News debate moderator for asking a “gotcha” question about their struggling campaign. Another panelist gets booed for asking Michele Bachmann about their comment that women should be submissive to their husbands. Christine O'Donnell, the failed Senate candidate in Delaware, walks out on Piers Morgan after refusing to answer queries about what they wrote in the very book she's promoting.
What's going on here?
In part, it's about working the media refs. Pushing back against the inquisitors as unfair bullies deflects attention from the question you don't want to answer. Journalists, who aren't winning any popularity contests these days, can be useful foils, especially for Republicans.
But do the complainers have a point? What exactly is a gotcha question, anyway?
I'd define it as an attempt to trap someone into an embarrassing response by asking about something that the public figure is unlikely to know, that's contradicted by something deep in their or their past, or that's so personal as to be out of bounds.
That was hardly the case last week when CNN's Morgan was questioning O'Donnell, the GOP candidate perhaps best remembered for their I-am-not-a-witch commercial.
MORGAN: What is your view of gay marriage, for example?
O'DONNELL: I address that stuff in the book.
MORGAN: You can't—you're on here to promote the damn book. So, you can't keep saying it's all in the book. You got to repeat some of it.
O'DONNELL: I'm here to talk about the book.
MORGAN: Yes. I'm talking about the book. You keep saying it's all in the book. So, tell me what's in the book.
After they sparred for a bit, O'Donnell told their British interviewer that they were being “a little bit rude,” that gay marriage is “not a topic that I choose to embrace,” and summed up with a stunning misunderstanding of the media culture: “Don't you think as a host, if I say this is what I want to talk about, that's what we should address?”
Actually, no. If you're peddling a book, any sentence contained within is fair game. If you want to control the conversation, buy a commercial. (Though don't spend any time feeling sorry for either party. The walkout has given Morgan their best buzz in months, and O'Donnell got to play the victim in other interviews, accusing them on the Today show of “borderline sexual harassment.” Come on.)
In the debate shortly before the Iowa Straw Poll, here is the question from Fox's Chris Wallace that Gingrich labeled as “gotcha”:
“One of the ways that we judge a candidate is the campaign they run. In June, almost your entire national campaign staff resigned, along with your staff here in Iowa. They said that you were undisciplined in campaigning and fundraising, and at last report you're a million dollars in debt. How do you respond to people who say that your campaign has been a mess so far?”
That was a factual recitation of Gingrich's recent campaign woes. But the former House speaker accused Wallace of “playing Mickey Mouse games”—and this to an anchor at Fox, not some liberal commentator at MSNBC.
“I think those are questions that a lot of people want to hear answers to, and you're responsible for your record, sir,” Wallace responded.
This was hardly in the same category as Wallace's Fox News Sunday question to Bachmann—“Are you a flake?”—which came across as condescending, and for which they later apologized.
The Iowa audience booed Wallace over the Gingrich questions, but not as lustily as it booed the Washington Examiner's Byron York, who had the temerity to ask Bachmann about a statement they made in church five years ago that is captured on videotape. The Minnesota member of congress had said they went into tax law at their husband's suggestion, although they didn't want to, noting, “The Lord said, Be submissive. Wives, you are to be submissive to your husbands.”
As president, York asked, would Bachmann be submissive to them husband?
Bachmann, to their credit, did not complain about the question and handled it well, saying they and their spouse have a relationship of mutual respect. But the Republican crowd clearly felt it was out of bounds. York later called it “a serious and legitimate question about something they have said” and that the exchange provided “a very human moment” for Bachmann.
But there are some questions that journalists shouldn't ask—because they are based on rumor and innuendo.
In an interview last week with presidential contender Ron Paul, Fox anchor Martha MacCallum said: “One question surfaced in The Austin Chronicle. And that question was in the form of an ad that is said to be from a Ron Paul supporter, and the question is, have you ever had sex with Governor Rick Perry? And it goes on to say, are you a stripper, an escort, or just a young hottie impressed by an arrogant, entitled governor of Texas?” What, McCallum wanted to know, was Paul's response?
Let's review: The anchor repeated the totally unsubstantiated suggestions of a self-proclaimed supporter of a rival candidate that strippers, escorts, or hotties may have had sex with Perry, if only they would come forward to confirm it. MacCallum not only gave national exposure to a blatant smear, they tried to make Paul defend it, though neither they nor their campaign had anything to do with it.
The ad is the handiwork of Robert Morrow, who describes themselves as “a self-employed investor and political activist” and heads the Committee Against Sexual Hypocrisy. “Is it a real group? No, it's just me,” Morrow told Salon.
Paul wisely refused to engage, saying: “Well, I don't know how something like that qualifies as a question on national TV as if it's something serious … I don't know anything about it. For me to address it would give it too much credibility.” Exactly.
Aggressive journalism is, and should be, part of the political process. The “gotcha” complaints and stalking off the set are, for the most part, self-serving hooey. But there are some questions, even if they involve hot stuff about hotties, that don't pass the smell test.
Yeah, mom, I'm moving to Utah for Uni.
Crossing academics with competitive video games is clearly starting to become the norm as the University of Utah joins the trend of forming their own Varsity Esports team starting with Riot Games' League of Legends.
Hailed as one of the “Power Five conferences”, which in the USA means that you're one of the NCAA members to offer the highest level of collegiate football and is also home to one of the best collegiate football teams, the University of Utah is the first from the members of the said conference to offer Esports scholarships and hopes that other institutions follow suit, with A.J. Dimick, of the university's Game Studio Relations, and head of the new Esports program saying “We [University of Utah] want others schools to join us” in their Esports venture.
As they are starting with League of Legends, the University of Utah varsity Esports team will soon be participating in Riot Games' League of Legends Collegiate League with the players to initially receive a partial scholarship, which will soon expand to a full scholarship which targets a set total of 35 student gamers.
The University of Utah now joins the growing list of schools in the USA to offer Esports scholarship programs, which also includes schools like the University of California – Irvine, which is developing their own Esports Arena, and Ohio's Lourdes University.
Your front-page story (Lords: Rise of CCTV is threat to freedom, 6 February) paints a disappointingly one-sided picture of the use of CCTV, the DNA database and powers that can keep our streets safe and bring criminals to book.
CCTV has helped to reclaim our town centres and public spaces for the law-abiding majority. It plays a key role in crime prevention and reducing the fear of crime - and CCTV footage was crucial in prosecuting those who planned suicide bombings in London on 21 July 2005. I know of no community in the country that has yet to join the crusade of some in the Conservative party for fewer CCTV cameras. Quite the reverse.
The DNA database has revolutionised police investigations. Each year, literally hundreds of homicides and rapes are resolved with the use of DNA matches. Of course, the strengths of the database can only be safeguarded if they enjoy public confidence. In December I announced immediate steps to remove the DNA of children under 10 from the database, and set out the case for greater flexibility and fairness in the system.
I have made clear the need to avoid frivolous use of investigatory powers, and will shortly consult on revisions to the use of the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act. Where surveillance or data collection impacts on privacy it should only be used where it is both necessary and proportionate.
Those who claim we live in a "surveillance society" need to remember there are two sides to this story. We need to ensure personal privacy at the same time as we protect the public. I will continue to strike a commonsense balance between the two.

The House of Lords report into surveillance draws attention to a pressing social issue. However, the debate is locked in a familiar stalemate - those for surveillance and those against it, with little in terms of practical action, technological regulation or legislative change.
Too much focus falls on contemporary surveillance apparatuses and techniques at the expense of understanding the cultural context in which this phenomenon has grown and the social implications that are at stake. How surveillance in everyday life has become "normalised" through popular cultural broadcasts and texts needs more attention, so too better understanding of the general logic behind surveillance.
It is also worth highlighting that surveillance systems are increasingly developed and administered by commercial institutions using information derived from our web browsers, credit/debit and loyalty cards. New forms of power have emerged which supplant the notion that the "surveillance society" is some state conspiracy. Indeed, surveillance needs to be seen as a diverse set of practices.
While the Lords report is valuable, it is already a historical document and thus provides recommendations that are about past or present capabilities, rather than future potentialities; and it is in this latter period we should be focusing our attentions.

I have recently agreed to take on a pub in a residential part of Islington. Under normal circumstances this would have simply involved the existing licence holder signing over the premises' licence to me. Unfortunately they had gone insolvent and disappeared so I applied for a new licence, which requires the approval of a number of organisations, including the police. I was stunned to find the police were prepared to approve, ie not fight, our licence on condition that we installed CCTV capturing the head and shoulders of everyone coming into the pub, to be made available to them upon request. There was no way that they could have imposed this on the previous licence holder.
As it happens the Islington Labour party headquarters is on the same street as the pub and, being a member, I contacted the MP Emily Thornberry to see if they really thinks they need their photo taken when they pop in for a pint - needless to say I have not heard from them I also spoke with a friend who is the licensing officer for another borough. Not only did they tell me that there was nothing I could do to overturn this, they also strongly advised me not to blot my copybook with the police by even questioning the request; I would not want them against me in the future, they said.
I have been spitting teeth in a silent rage since I first heard of this request, but at every turn I am alternately advised to keep my head down or laughed at for my naivety for thinking that the world was ever not thus. When was it that the constant small erosion of our liberties became irreversible?

In Ealing we have a council that has gone overboard with surveillance cameras mounted, ironically, on almost every one of our new "old world" street lights. At South Ealing underground station there are a mind-boggling 40 cameras covering its every centimetre.
It seems the surveillance industry has fuelled the paranoia and persuaded councils and other public bodies to go down this road to allay exaggerated fears fuelled by the media and supine ministers. For the manufacturers of the equipment it is a bonanza - with the servicing and monitoring they have an ongoing source of steady income.

I've actually stood in full view of a CCTV fitted inside a bus one day when a couple of idiots threatened me after I asked them to turn down their music. It made me feel safer. Terrorists, rapists and muggers have been convicted thanks to footage to back up testimony. So, what's wrong with them? As far as I can see, CCTV is a threat to freedom to commit a crime.

MANILA, Philippines - Domingo M. Guevara Street, formerly known as Libertad, is one of Mandaluyongâ€™s busiest thoroughfares. It is also the name of a self-made industrialist closely associated with a number of well-known brands in the â€˜60s and â€˜70s and who aspired to see the Philippines become an industrialized country
Guevara founded Radiowealth, a brand of affordable Philippine-made radios, TVs and other appliances that dominated the local market prior to the advent of the Japanese brands. They also assembled Volkswagen vehicles initially in their Libertad, Mandaluyong plant, then made the brand a household name in the Philippines. This experience led them to create the first Filipino designed and fabricated vehicle called the Sakbayan in the late â€˜60s.
At its height, the industrialistâ€™s Guevara Enterprises or Guevent Group was engaged in manufacturing, electronics, communications, agriculture and industrial development, transportation and its own financing company, Radiowealth Finance, which continues to operate to this day through 80 branches all over the country.
They transformed their part of Mandaluyong into a dynamic center of light industry and the cradle of audacious ideas such as manufacturing a Filipino car. A great model for an aspiring â€œTiger City,â€ Guevara, who passed away in the â€˜90s, would have turned 104 years this January.
The business genius traced their roots to Camarines Sur, where they learned to be a radio technician through a correspondence course. Although fascinated by the radio, they made a living running the family farm. Fortunately for him, a dispute with a neighbor over the farm led them to move to Manila where they eventually set up a radio repair shop and transformed Radiowealth from a â€œone-man, one-door affairâ€ to a dynamic manufacturing concern.
In the early â€˜60s,which was dominated by gas-guzzling American cars, Guevara identified the need for more fuel-efficient vehicles. They wooed Volkswagen Germany to allow their company in the Philippines to assemble its famous models like the Beetle and the Kombi. In a memoir Guevara wrote: â€œBefore DMG (his motor firm formally called Diesel Motors Germany Inc.) came into the picture, nobody had foreseen that the Filipino motorist would go for the small car. And when the demand came, DMG was about the only one ready to serve it with the Volkswagen brand.â€
As they built up their enterprises, Guevara also made available to the Philippine market a succession of machines and equipment helpful to agriculture, the military and other groups. These machines included various tractor models, diesel trucks of various makes and sizes, radio transceivers, and even computers and digital communications equipment. They also spotted the opportunities provided by new business models like the Avis car rental franchise, which they first established 40 years ago.
Reynaldo Guevara, the first president of Avis and chairperson emeritus of Guevent Investments Development Corp., observes: â€œAvis was a natural extension of the Volkswagen business. We started off with Volkswagen cars but have evolved since then.â€
Alejandrino Ferreria, a former DMG executive and current chairperson of Avis Philippines, remembers working with Guevent founder Domingo Guevara: â€œThe industrialistâ€™s passion to excel and to succeed later drove them to undertake forward and backward integration.â€
In addition to pioneering in the manufacturing of TV sets in the country, they also produced components like TV picture tubes and speakers.
National artist Nick Joaquin wrote about the peak of Guevaraâ€™s career in the early â€˜70s: â€œThe first full-fledged auto manufacturer of the Philippines was selling up to 5,000 vehicles a year, was creating the first Philippine-made car, and was manufacturing picture tubes and other electronic components.
â€œHe had brought their countryâ€™s economy to a crucial threshold: the point of take-off for a NIC, a Newly Industrialized Country.â€
Then Martial Law was declared and all of Guevaraâ€™s plans were thwarted. Before the Marcos takeover backed up by military rule, Guevara had been elected a delegate of the 1971 Constitutional Convention who sought to promulgate programs that would jumpstart the industrialization of the Philippines. Being the man of principle that they are, Guevara was one of seven delegates that voted against the martial law constitution.
Soon after, Marcos representatives were asking the business person if they could â€œbuyâ€ into their companies. Domingo Jr., Guevaraâ€™s third son, recalls in their fatherâ€™s biography: â€œI quoted a price to the emissary and asked if their principle could pay it. And the emissary said no, and that no price would be paid. I said: â€˜What do you mean?â€™ And they reported that I should feel flattered that President (Marcos) wanted to â€˜investâ€™ in our company.â€
When the senior Guevara made it plain that they were not interested in a one-sided partnership with Marcos and their cronies, their firms began experiencing problems with their bankers, and from the Bureaus of Internal Revenue and Customs. â€œWhat could a business person do? There was no way of fighting back (under martial law conditions),â€ Guevara recalled in their biography.
They got to the point when they realized how futile it would be to fight for their enterprises. Had they held on, they would still have lost them. â€œAnd if I let them in, I would lose the business just the same, since they, and not I, would be in controlâ€¦ All these pressures were beginning to affect my health.â€ It became a choice of losing their business or losing their health. Guevara and their wife went into exile in the US.
Joaquin sums up the manâ€™s contributions: â€œIn their time, there was a fascination with machinery, the start of a skill in electronics, a growing audacity in enterprise, more and more thrust into manufacturing, and an outright intent to make that great leap forward to industrialization.â€ The Guevara era will remain an inspiration and a viable model for future generations.
The date and kick-off time for Arsenal's FA Cup semi-final against Manchester City has been announced.
The Gunners will face Pep Guardiola's side on Sunday April 23rd at Wembley, kicking off at 3pm.
Amazingly, the two sides have only met three times previously in this competition. Two goals from Charlie George helped Arsenal to a 2-1 win at Maine Road on the way to winning the cup (and the double) in 1971.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2l_tPDf1gHs
Before that Arsenal beat City 2-1 in 1931-32, and were on the wrong end of a 2-0 scoreline in the 1903-04 season.
It will be the second meeting of the sides in three weeks as City come to the Emirates on April 2nd, the first game after the Interlull which kicks in after this weekend's fixtures.
Story highlights Sentences range from 541 days to 20 years
Convictions centered on 16 militants abducted by agents in the 1970's
(CNN) A Chilean judge sentenced 106 former intelligence agents for their role in the kidnappings and disappearances of 16 leftist militants during the Augusto Pinochet dictatorship.
According to the 714-page ruling Friday night, the sentences range from 541 days to 20 years. The convictions are the result of one of the largest mass prosecutions in Chile related to human rights abuses during Pinochet's rule from 1973-1990.
The convictions centered on 16 leftist militants who were abducted by agents of the National Intelligence Directorate between June 1974 and January 1975, transported to various detention centers and never seen again.
The secret police then tried to cover up the deaths of the 16 militants -- and more than 100 others -- by planting stories in foreign newspapers to imply that they were killed while fighting abroad, and not at the hands of the government.
Several of the intelligence agents sentenced are already serving sentences for other human rights violation convictions. An additional 13 agents who were charged were absolved, according to the Chilean judiciary.

Michael Cheek scored their first goal for Dagenham & Redbridge since returning from injury to help the Essex club draw 1-1 at Maidenhead United in the National League.
Daggers headed to York Road looking for consecutive wins for the first time since August, having beaten Wrexham at home on Tuesday night.
However, those hopes were dealt a blow in the 40th minute when Remy Clerima found the net for the hosts, slotting into the bottom left corner of the net.
Just 10 minutes into the second half, though, Cheek drew Daggers level with their first goal since scoring a brace against Bromley on August 26, the game in which they suffered their knee injury.
Charlee Adams dinked the ball into the path of Morgan Ferrier, who in turn squared it to Cheek, who duly finished.
Daggers now have a break before they return to action, with their next match away to Tranmere Rovers on November 11.
Beef Chili with Sour Cream and Cheddar Biscuits
Adapted from Gourmet
A couple notes: First, if you like a saucier chili, you might reduce the beef by one pound, though this might reduce your serving size. [Updated to add:] You could also add a second can of beans, as some commenters have suggested. Second, I didn't get the rise out of these biscuits that I'd expected to. Since they were delicious and other commenters have raved about them, I assumed it was me and didn't bother tinkering with them. Finally, the original recipe says that it serves six but I think it stretches further, especially if you're doing this shortcake-style, with just a ladleful on top. I'd suggest scaling the biscuit portion to the number of guests you're having. If you make more than you need, I recommend freezing the extras unbaked until you're ready to serve the chili again — you can bake them directly from the freezer, and they'll always be fresh and crisp. [Updated a few years later to add:] I mention this in the previous note, but not as clearly as I should have: this makes a lot of chili but not that many biscuits. The proportions, especially if you want to serve this on biscuits, are off. I'd double or triple the biscuit recipe if serving the full batch of chili. Enjoy!
Serves [more than] 6
2 large onions, chopped (about 3 cups)
1/4 cup vegetable oil
1 tablespoon minced garlic
2 carrots, sliced thin (suggested by Gourmet) or in a small dice, as I'd chop them next time
3 pounds boneless beef chuck, ground coarse or 3 pounds ground beef
1/4 cup chili powder
1 tablespoon ground cumin
2 tablespoons paprika
1 tablespoon crumbled dry oregano
Dried red pepper flakes, to taste (Gourmet suggests 1 tablespoon; I used 1 teaspoon knowing that my flakes are very hot)
2 8-ounce cans tomato sauce or 2 cups fresh tomato sauce or tomato puree
1 1/4 cups beef broth
3 tablespoons cider vinegar
1 3/4 cups or 1 19-ounce can kidney beans, rinsed and drained
2 green bell peppers, chopped
Sour Cream and Cheddar Biscuits, below
Sour cream and pickled jalapeños (optional, to finish)
In a large pot (I used a 5-quart, and just fit it all), heat the oil over moderately low heat and cook the onions in it for 5 to 10 minutes, until softened. Add the garlic and carrots and cook for one minute more. Raise the heat to medium and add the beef, stirring and breaking up any lumps until it is no longer pink, about 10 minutes. Add the chili powder, cumin, paprika, oregano and pepper flakes and cook for another minute. Add the tomato sauce, broth and vinegar and simmer the chili, covered, for 35 to 40 minutes (if you used ground beef) or 50 to 60 minutes (if you used coarse chuck). Add the kidney beans, bell peppers, salt (I used 2 teaspoons to get the seasoning right for my tastes) and pepper to taste and simmer for an additional 15 minutes, until the bell peppers are tender.
Serve ladled over a split Sour Cream and Cheddar Biscuit, below, with additional sour cream and pickled jalapenos, if desired.
Sour Cream and Cheddar Biscuits
Adapted from Gourmet
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
2 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
2 tablespoons cold unsalted butter, cut into bits
1/4 pound sharp Cheddar cheese, coarsely grated (about 1 1/2 cups)
Drained and chopped pickled jalapeños, to taste (I used about 2 tablespoons)
1 cup sour cream
Preheat oven to 425°F. Whisk together the flour, baking powder, baking soda and salt in a large bowl. Either cut the butter pieces into the flour mixture with a pastry blender or rub them in with your fingertips until well-combined. Stir in the cheddar, jalapeños and sour cream until the mixture forms a sticky dough. Pat it out to a 1/2-inch thickness on a very well-floured counter and use a 3 1/2-inch biscuit cutter to cut six rounds. Bake on an ungreased (or parchment-lined, if your baking sheets are as “weathered” as mine are) for 15 to 17 minutes, until golden on top.
Do ahead: If you'd like to serve them over a couple days, I recommend freezing already formed but unbaked biscuits until you are ready to bake them — you can bake them directly from the freezer, adding just a minute or two to the baking time.
Chevy Volt sales are cranking up. General Motors sold three times as many Chevrolet Volts in 2012 as it did in 2011, which was the car's first full year on the market.
GM sold 23,461 Volts in 2012 compared with just 7,671 in 2011. While it's an impressive jump, the Volt is still one of Chevy's lowest-selling cars. However, the Volt greatly outdid the Corvette, for instance, of which only 14,000 were sold last year.
Its 2012 sales also put the Volt well ahead of its nearest competitor, the Nissan Leaf. Nissan sold about 9,800 Leafs in 2012, an increase of just 1.5% over 2011. Still, Nissan pointed out, it was a record year for Leaf sales.
The single biggest factor driving the sales increase, according to both GM and industry analysts, was the Volt's increased popularity in car-clogged California. Sales there jumped thanks to a few engineering tweaks that made the Volt eligible for California's highly desirable carpool lane stickers for the first time.
"More than half of all Volt sales are in California," said Alec Guitierrez, an analyst with Kelley Blue Book. The car has also been catching on in other markets, however, including Michigan and in the Chicago area, according to GM.
Besides the carpool lane stickers, the Volt has also been helped by aggressive leasing incentives offered in 2012. Last year, GM was offering the car for $289 a month with a $2,800 down payment. That was far less than a car with the Volt's nearly $40,000 purchase price would ordinarily lease for, even factoring in a $7,500 plug-in car tax credit.
"The math on the Volt starts to make sense to the masses at those prices," said Jesse Toprak, an analyst with the auto pricing Web site Truecar.com.
Chevy Volt owners routinely report getting triple-digit gas mileage, according to the Web site Voltstats.net.
Related: Cheapest cars to fuel
While even those fuel savings might not make up the car's relatively high cost at full sticker price, the low lease rates made the Volt's price more comparable to ordinary fully-gasoline-powered cars.
Following a full charge, the Volt can drive about 38 miles on plug-in electric power, according to EPA estimates, before a gasoline engine switches on to generate power for further driving.
The Volt faced some serious sales challenges in 2012, pointed out Tom Libby, an auto sales analyst with Polk. At the beginning of the year, GM voluntarily recalled the cars to fix a battery packaging problem that could, in some unusual crash circumstances, lead to a fire risk. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration later closed its investigation finding that the Volt, even before the recall, had posed no greater fire risk than other cars. Even so, said Libby, news of the investigation and recall caused significant negative publicity for the car which seems to have now been overcome.
Regardless of the good news, Libby said, it still bears remembering that sales of the Volt, which is now the best-selling plug-in car in America, are still miniscule compared to most other cars. In 2012, Chevrolet dealers sold almost exactly 10 times as many of the Chevrolet Cruze, the gasoline powered car on which the Volt is based.
"They realize the need to do better," they said.
Competing For Completion
With Lofty Offensive Totals, Aston-Reese Out To Prove He's The Best In All Three Zones
by Mike McMahon/Staff Writer (@MikeMcMahonCHN)
As well as he's played all season, Northeastern senior Zach Aston-Reese is saving their best for last.
In a season with no clear-cut Hobey Baker Award candidates going into it, Aston-Reese has certainly become one, if not the favorite.
Last week, the senior from Staten Island had a hat trick in a win over Connecticut. Then Friday night at Maine, Aston-Reese score twice more and setup Nolan Stevens for an overtime winner, securing a home-ice spot for the Huskies in the opening round of next week's Hockey East playoffs.
With five goals in their last two games heading into Saturday's season finale against the Black Bears, Aston-Reese leads the nation in scoring with 59 points and in goals with 29. Yet, when you ask Northeastern head coach Jim Madigan about what makes their senior such a dangerous player, Madigan focuses as much on Aston-Reese's play without the puck.
“To understand them as a player, you can't just look for a measurement in points alone,” Madigan said. “He's a 200-foot player. They battle and he's physical and they win those battles along the wall for us. He's out there killing penalties and we have them out there in every situation.”
Oddly enough, Aston-Reese wasn't a big offensive threat when they were a junior player in the United States Hockey League. Playing three seasons with the Lincoln Stars, they combined for just 16 goals in 140 games. By comparison, in their last 74 collegiate games (combining their junior and senior seasons), Aston-Reese has 43 goals.
But those offensive struggles are what turned Aston-Reese into a dangerous two-way player. It forced them to evolve their game.
“After struggling a bit in juniors, I learned that those details are more important than dangling a guy and going up shelf,” they said. “Not that it's not important to work on skill, but it's the little details that separates players. NHL players, the ones who aren't big names but contribute to their team's success, that's what they're doing, they're playing 200 feet. That's how I see myself, and that's how I want to play, I want to be a 200-foot player.”
The fact that Aston-Reese has developed that part of their game, combined with their skill as an offensive player, has NHL scouts drooling over the potential of signing them at the end of this season. Aston-Reese has NHL measurables at 6-foot tall and 204 pounds.
“We've watched them all season,” said one Western Conference scout. “To be honest, we watched them last season. The free-agent class in the NCAA isn't huge this year, and I don't think there is a Johnny Gaudreau out there, but (Aston-Reese) is someone who I think can contribute to an NHL team. To me, once they get adjusted to the speed of the game at the next level, I think they can be a player who fits nicely on a club and can kill penalties and be an effective two-way player.”
Madigan was an NHL scout for 18 years before taking the Northeastern job in 2011, spending time with both the New York Islanders and Pittsburgh Penguins. They look at Aston-Reese as being the most pro-ready player in college hockey. That list includes fellow undrafted free agents Tyler Kelleher (UNH), Mike Vecchione (Union) and Anders Bjork (Notre Dame), a Boston Bruins draft pick. All of those players, and a few more, are considered to be in the handful of favorites to win the Hobey Baker Award at the Frozen Four in April.
“People think he's just coming on this year, but they had 43 points last year as a junior,” they said. “There are some other players out there that might be flashier and more crafty offensively, but Zach has a game that translates perfectly to the National Hockey League. That's why everyone is on him. He's plays defense and he's really intelligent. We give our offensive players some latitude, but our guys know that they need to manage that and can't risk things too much. He's incredibly smart when it comes to that.”
Aston-Reese says it's been easy to tune out the noise, and there's plenty of noise to tune out when you're one of the top undrafted free agents on the market. It's common to see NHL scouts, and some even higher up in front offices, linger in locker room hallways after games waiting for some one-on-one face time with their free-agent targets. Aston-Reese hasn't been immune to those meetings, of course, but said it hasn't affected their focus.
“I think it's been simple to tune that out,” they said. “Some teammates might bring stuff up and joke around, but it's fun. When it comes to practice though, when we're at the rink, it's time to work. All the noise goes out the window. Monday we're focused on that next Friday game and everything we need to do to win that game. For me, that noise goes away. I don't like to pay attention to it.”
Aston-Reese has helped the Huskies charge on a similar run to last season, when they had just three wins through December but finished the season on a 20-2-2 run, winning a Hockey East championship. The Huskies had a slightly better first half this season, but are currently on a 9-2-1 run since Jan. 14.
With a win over Maine last night, the Huskies passed Merrimack and moved into seventh place in Hockey East. That secures a home-ice spot for the Huskies in the first round of the Hockey East playoffs, which begins next weekend.
“The tipping point for us was losing the first Monday in the Beanpot,” Aston-Reese said. “We talked as a team afterwards, and the message was that everyone needed to buy in. Everyone needed to play their role.
“For us, it's about keeping it simple. Guys like myself, (Adam) Gaudette, (Dylan) Sikura and Nolan (Stevens), we can put pucks in the net, but we need to get back and grind harder. That's our mentality. We are a really hard team to play against when we play like that.”
Aston-Reese's rise as an offensive player has coincided with several of their teammates also seeing huge upticks in production. Sikura has 52 points this season (19 goals, 33 assists) after they had 28 points as a sophomore. Gaudette has 51 points, including 25 goals, after a 30-point first-year student season.
Northeastern has also been without Nolan and John Stevens for big chunks of this season. The Huskies got John Stevens back in the lineup last night, and they chipped in with two assists at Maine. Stevens now has 101 career points. Nolan Stevens returned the lineup earlier this month and has 14 points in 12 games after a 42-point sophomore campaign.
“Getting those guys back really bolsters our roster,” Aston-Reese said.
“The Dog House,” as Northeastern's fans are affectionately known, hope that Aston-Reese can once again help bolster the Huskies to success this postseason. At the end of the road there could be some trophies waiting, including one with the name “Hobey” engraved on it.
If the all-American fast food chain Burger King, with its thousands of restaurants in the United States, can claim to be a foreign company for tax purposes, our corporate tax system is in real trouble.
The crisis of corporate inversions is now apparent even to those who aren't connected to the boring details of tax policy. The specifics of inversions are clear to everyone: A U.S. corporation merges with a smaller foreign company and claims the foreign country as its address, even though the vast majority of the business continues to be carried out and managed in the U.S. The public outrage is so apparent that Walgreen Co. backed off its plans to invert.
ADVERTISEMENT
This ire stems from the justified belief that there's a separate set of rules for powerful corporations. So here's a thought. To restore some level of fairness to the system, require corporations that declare they are no longer American to pay the U.S. taxes that they have put off, just as we do to individuals who renounce their U.S. citizenship.
Specifically, Congress should require that any corporation that becomes a foreign company must pay U.S. taxes it has deferred on profits it has accumulated offshore.
This measure would not be a new tax but merely the elimination of a special tax break (the ability to defer paying taxes on profits earned offshore) for companies that say they are no longer American.
American multinational corporations are given this tax break supposedly to help them compete with multinational corporations based in other countries. Questions of whether this tax break makes sense aside, we shouldn't offer this break to corporations that declare themselves no longer American..
Right now our tax laws give corporations a better deal than individuals when it comes to expatriation. Corporations and individuals are both allowed to defer paying income taxes on key parts of their income, but only individuals are required under current law to give up that benefit when they renounce their U.S. citizenship.
Individuals are allowed to defer paying income taxes on their capital gains (appreciation of assets) until they sell their assets. But when wealthy individuals renounce their U.S. citizenship, they are required to pay income tax on unrealized capital gains (appreciation on assets they have not sold).
Corporations are allowed to defer paying income taxes on the profits they earn offshore until repatriating them to the U.S. Unlike individuals, corporations do not lose this key tax break when they become foreign. Congress should change that, meaning these offshore profits should be subject to U.S. corporate income taxes as if they were repatriated to the U.S. at the point when the company inverts.
This could dramatically reduce incentives for certain corporations to invert. For example, the medical device maker Medtronic, which is merging with Covidien and plans to change its corporate address to Ireland, has $20.5 billion in permanently reinvested earnings offshore, and $13.9 billion of that is cash or cash equivalents (the profits the company is most likely to repatriate to the U.S.). Medtronic acknowledges that if it repatriates these profits it would pay U.S. income taxes on them at an effective rate in the range of 25 to 30 percent. Given that the U.S. tax on offshore profits is reduced by whatever tax has been paid to foreign governments, this suggests that Medtronic books a lot of profits in very low-tax countries that normal people call tax havens.
After inverting, Medtronic will technically be the subsidiary of a foreign company. It could route these offshore profits through its ostensible foreign parent company, or one of that company's subsidiaries, to get this money into the hands of shareholders without triggering the 25 to 30 percent U.S. income tax that would normally be due upon repatriation.
If these offshore profits were taxed as if repatriated at the point of inversion, this tax dodge would be stopped and Medtronic would likely decide that inversion is not in its interest after all.
To be clear, this proposal would complement others already on the table. A bill introduced by Rep. Sander Levin (D-Mich.) and Sen. Carl Levin Carl Milton LevinListen, learn and lead: Congressional newcomers should leave the extremist tactics at home House Democrats poised to set a dangerous precedent with president's tax returns The Hill's 12:30 Report — Sponsored by Delta Air Lines — White House to 'temporarily reinstate' Acosta's press pass after judge issues order | Graham to take over Judiciary panel | Hand recount for Florida Senate race MORE (D-Mich.) in May would prevent inverted corporations from being treated as foreign companies for tax purposes. A bill introduced by Sen. Charles Schumer Charles (Chuck) Ellis SchumerBrennan fires back at 'selfish' Trump over Harry Reid criticism Trump rips Harry Reid for 'failed career' after ex-Dem leader slams them in interview Harry Reid: 'I don't see anything' Trump is doing right MORE (D-N.Y.) last week would stop inverted corporations from dodging taxes on future profits through the practice called earnings stripping. Congress should enact these reforms immediately. A third part of the problem is the ability of inverted corporations to dodge taxes on profits they accumulated offshore before inverting, which can be solved by taxing offshore profits as if they are repatriated at the point of inversion.
Inverted corporations are American companies pretending to be foreign even as they benefit from public investments financed by U.S. taxes. The reform described here would make corporations much less likely to use this tax dodge and more likely to pay their fair share. And our tax code would move one step closer to something resembling common sense.

A team of researchers has revealed that fetal mice- especially males- show signs of brain damage that lasts into their adulthood when they are exposed in the womb to a maternal immune system kicked into high gear by a serious infection or other malady.
The findings suggest that some neurologic diseases in humans could be similarly rooted in prenatal exposure to inflammatory immune responses.
The investigators said that the part of the brain responsible for memory and spatial navigation (the hippocampus) was smaller over the long term in the male offspring exposed to the overactive immune system in the womb.
The males also had fewer nerve cells in their brains and their brains contained a type of immune cell that shouldn't be present there.
"Our research suggests that in mice, males may be more vulnerable to the effects of maternal inflammation than females, and the impact may be life long," study leader Irina Burd, M.D., Ph.D., an assistant professor of gynecology/obstetrics and neurology at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, said.
"Now we wonder if this could explain why more males have diseases such as autism and schizophrenia, which appear to have neurobiological causes," the researcher said.
For the study, researchers sought to mimic the effects of a maternal infection or other condition that causes inflammation in a pregnant mother.
Burd and their colleagues used a mouse model to study what happens to the brains of those offspring as they age into adulthood to see if the effects persisted.
Chronic inflammation, Burd said, may play a role in keeping the hippocampus small, potentially because it inhibits proper brain development. But why males and females respond differently to the same insult in utero remains a question.
The study was published in the journal Brain, Behavior and Immunity.
First of all, there is pent-up demand. There are a lot of people with hepatitis C — an estimated 3.2 million in the United States — many of whom have been waiting for a good treatment. Second, unlike drugs for most chronic diseases, like diabetes or H.I.V./AIDS, for which treatment continues over many years, Sovaldi can cure most patients' hepatitis in just a few weeks, with the bill soon to follow. The lifetime cost of treating someone with an H.I.V. infection is around $380,000, according to estimates from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, but the annual bill is much smaller.
Think about AIDS treatment as paying a mortgage. Sovaldi is like buying a house with cash.
The United States health insurance system works better for costs that are spread out and predictable. People change insurance frequently, discouraging insurers from making a big investment now that might pay off later. That does not mean that our health care system is not expensive — it is — but we are more used to costs that pile up slowly over time. Expensive one-time treatments like Sovaldi can be a shock to the system.
Hepatitis C slowly destroys the liver. Over decades, many infected people will end up with liver damage and complications, including joint pain and kidney disease, while a smaller number will get cirrhosis or liver cancer, and a tiny fraction will end up needing liver transplants. People used to get the virus from blood transfusions; now, it is contracted mostly by intravenous drug users who share needles.
Until now, doctors would mostly treat hepatitis C patients' symptoms. Some drugs attacked the virus itself, but they did not work very well. And most had side effects, including fever, depression and anemia, that about half the patients were not healthy enough to tolerate.

Local vacation homeowners are on watch for possible privacy violations after a recent Sunriver Police Department investigation found that a doorbell camera secretly recorded vacationers hot-tubbing in the nude without their permission.
Although no charges were filed and the case closed Monday, Deschutes County District Attorney John Hummel said they were concerned about the conduct — and that other rental property owners should take notice as well.
“I put this homeowner on notice that going forward they have to either stop recording the hot tub or notify their guests that they are being recorded,” Hummel said.
The investigation was opened up after 59-year-old Kenneth Neish of Portland, owner of a Sunriver vacation rental, called the police April 15 to report their weekend tenants talked about LSD, a Sunriver Police report states.
Officers arrived at the home and detained four men staying there, then searched one man's luggage, according to an account submitted to police by one of the men. No drugs were found, but police told the men that the owner of the rental property had an audio recording of the men and said they were discussing the use of LSD.
Sunriver Police said the homeowner had a Ring Video Doorbell installed on the front of the house. In addition to being a doorbell, the device also records audio and video and can be accessed remotely by the owner of the device.
On April 20, one of the men, Bend resident Brian Reilly, 40, contacted Sunriver Police about a possible investigation into the recording.
The issue was that the doorbell contained a camera, which was somewhat hidden. The camera recorded the front porch, which includes a lowered hot tub with a 5-foot-tall privacy fence to make the hot tub area more secluded.
The doorbell was installed in April 2016 when Neish purchased the house. From then until April 17 of this year, there was no sign warning people that they were being recorded in the hot tub area.
Upon being informed that their conversations were recorded by the homeowner, several of the Easter weekend renters recalled being in the hot tub naked, according to the police report.
Following a complaint to the property management company — Mountain Resort Properties — a sign was placed on the door alerting guests they were being video and audio recorded.
When reached by police, Neish said they used the camera for security reasons and to see if employees, such as housekeepers, showed up when they were supposed to. They said they have no interest in watching guests in the hot tub.
When reached by The Bulletin on Tuesday, they said they only wanted to know if the hot tub was left uncovered when children were present and not supervised. They said the camera is practical.
“If I am told I am renting to a family and then I see 25 kids bringing a keg into the home, I need to protect my property,” Neish said.
Neish said in the year prior to this incident, no one ever complained. However, when asked, they said that none of the previous renters was ever told about the camera.
“We didn't put a notice on it, but it is pretty prevalent,” Neish said. “It is sitting right there next to the front door, and it's glowing blue. It is not like it is hidden or anything.”
Neish said the hot tub is only visible by the camera during the day. However, one of the times the visitors used the tub in the nude was in the morning. Further, photos from the doorbell camera included in the police report show the area directly to the right of the hot tub illuminated at night when the porch light was on.
The renters told police they were not aware that they were being recorded.
“When we found out, our world was rocked. Who would go to a vacation rental and be audio and visual recorded? We never expected that,” said renter John Hill, according to the police report.
But Neish contends that the renters knew exactly what the doorbell did. They said they have an audio recording of them discussing its capabilities. According to the police report, the renters said they discussed the doorbell, but were not aware that it was recording them. At one point they pressed the button on the doorbell and did not notice any changes, such as it turning on or off.
Neish said that pressing the doorbell initially alerted them to the renters. They then noticed several coolers — three according to the police report, four according to Neish — which Neish assumed were full of alcoholic drinks and felt was an excessive amount for one weekend. They then said a neighbor also called them to complain the group was noisy and had several cars in the driveway. The house is designed to sleep 10, though 19 children and adults were staying there that weekend, according to the police report.
Neish said the camera footage captured “public nudity” as well as men urinating off the deck.
“You would expect people to be more classy,” they said.
Neish called Mountain Resort Properties and said they wanted to evict the vacationers, and the company agreed, they said. They were told to leave one night before their reservation was to end.
When asked to explain why they called the police, Neish refused to elaborate.
“I was put in a situation where I had to report a crime to the police, because of what I heard,” they said. “That is why the police were involved. It was a felony crime.”
Attempts to reach Reilly, who made the complaint to police, and Hill, who was quoted in the police report, were unsuccessful. An attempt to reach a representative at Ring Video Doorbell was also unsuccessful.
Sunriver Police did not find evidence to substantiate Neish's allegations.
Hummel ultimately said while the front porch area is within the public domain, and therefore there is not a reasonable right to privacy, the hot tub is a private space.
“Homeowners should assume that in a vacation rental some people might enter a hot tub without their clothes on,” Hummel said. “That's something people sometimes do on vacations with hot tubs.”
However, they said that was countered by the location of the hot tub — on the front porch rather than backyard — and that this case was the first of its kind in the county.
Hummel said they will not be so lenient next time.
“If you don't tell them you are going to videotape them and then you videotape them, that's a crime,” they said. “Going forward, this homeowner and others in similar situations will be charged with a crime.”

Diego Costa has completed a medical examination at Chelsea and is poised to seal their £32m transfer from Atlético Madrid. The Brazil-born striker, who is a part of the Spain squad preparing for the World Cup finals, has been identified by José Mourinho as being what Chelsea need to win the Premier League title.
Chelsea were four points short of champions Manchester City, and their challenge came in spite of the lack of goals from their centre-forwards. Samuel Eto'o, Fernando Torres and Demba Ba contributed a total of 19 in the league, with Eto'o scoring nine of them. Mourinho would bemoan the shortfall at various junctures of their first season back at Chelsea.
They believe that the powerful and ruthless Costa can make the difference. The 25-year-old is fresh from their break-out season, in which they scored 27 goals in 34 league starts for Atlético, plus eight in nine in the Champions League, as their club won La Liga and were beaten by their city rivals, Real, in the European Cup final.
One of Costa's Champions League goals came from the penalty spot against Chelsea in the semi-final second leg at Stamford Bridge, which their team won 3-1 to progress by the same scoreline on aggregate. It was Costa's first season in the Champions League.
Chelsea were impressed with them before they saw them up close against them, despite their relative toils over the second half of the season. They had scored 23 of their goals in all competitions by 21 December, with the other 12 coming over the five months that followed. They struggled a little towards the end of the season with injury. Previously, they had never scored more than 10 league goals in a season.
Chelsea have paid the buyout clause in Costa's contract – they share the same agent as Mourinho, Jorge Mendes – and the club are pushing ahead with the rest of their business.
It is possible that they will have further dealings with Atlético, as they have an interest in the club's Brazil left-back, Filipe Luís, and their Portuguese midfielder, Tiago, who played for Chelsea in 2004-05, during Mourinho's first spell at Stamford Bridge.
The club need a left-back to replace the departing Ashley Cole and another midfielder to replace Frank Lampard. Tiago is available on a Bosman free transfer and they and Luís would help smooth Costa's integration in London.
Atlético have agreed a deal to sign the 19-year-old forward Ángel Correa from San Lorenzo in their native Argentina but they remain in the market for a more experienced option up front and Torres, who made their name at the Vicente Calderón, is under consideration for what would be an emotional homecoming.
Atlético are also interested in another Spanish striker – Roberto Soldado, who struggled at Tottenham Hotspur last season after a £26m move from Valencia. The Spanish champions announced the signing of the goalkeeper Miguel Moya from Getafe on Wednesday, increasing the likelihood that Thibaut Courtois will not be joining on loan from Chelsea for a fourth successive season.
Chelsea have already agreed a deal with Paris Saint-Germain to sell David Luíz for an initial £40m – the fee could rise to £50m – although the French champions have yet to confirm officially the Brazil defender's arrival. That is only a matter of time. Mourinho likes Real Madrid's French centre-back Raphaël Varane, while the club are also monitoring the situation of Cesc Fábregas, who could be available for £30m from Barcelona.
Mourinho expects Eto'o to depart under freedom of contract this summer while the futures of Torres and Ba remain doubtful, as does that of Romelu Lukaku, another striker who is technically back at Chelsea after the completion of their season-long loan at Everton. Mourinho also rates the Bayern Munich striker Mario Mandzukic.
Vividly illustrating the reality of cord-cutting, a report from SNL Kagan casts a new light on American media consumption.
The report released Wednesday found that 13% of U.S. homes, or one in eight, are equipped with broadband but do not subscribe to a traditional multichannel video bundle. The total number of such homes reached 15.4 million last year, up 2 million from 2015. The trend accelerated in the fourth quarter, with 427,000 homes going broadband-only compared with an increase of 395,000 in the same period in 2015.
Tony Lenoir of SNL Kagan, a unit of S&P Global Market Intelligence, projects the percentage of broadband-only homes will grow to 22% by 2021. The 2016 tally “should end the debate” about whether cord-cutting is a real phenomenon, they said.

Part of cord-cutters' motivation is price, certainly. But it's also about preference. The user interfaces, discovery features and overall experience of many traditional cable, satellite and telco offerings differ markedly from the more fluid and intuitive digital video services in the market. “While financial considerations likely are at play, the segment's trend, combined with the erosion of legacy multichannel, primarily underscores the evolution of video consumption preferences,” Lenoir wrote.
RELATED: Pay TV has lost record 1.3M subs so far this year, SNL Kagan says
The dawning recognition of cord-cutting's popularity, especially among millennial customers, has motivated MVPDs to roll out newer skinny services a la Sling TV and DirecTV Now. And U.S. broadband access is dominated by the traditional operators, meaning they can still profit amid the shift. But the question is about revenue per customer, plus recent numbers show that operators may be losing the race to replace departing video customers with new subscribers to skinny services.
In 2016, the U.S. pay-TV industry lost 1.7 million subscribers in 2016. MoffettNathanson analyst Craig Moffett called the shedding of 1.7% of subs “the fastest rate of decline on record.”
Programmers, too, have felt the pain. ESPN, which gets the majority of its revenue from cable carriage fees, has lost millions of subscribers in recent years, a direct hit on revenue. One result of all of this angst has been a rise in retransmission battles and blackouts, as programmers and operators used to reigning supreme fight for every dollar in the digital age.
Lenoir in January had predicted that the number of broadband-only homes could soar 83% from current levels to 28 million homes in 2021. In yesterday's report, they said, that earlier forecast “could end up on the conservative side given the speed at which the TV ecosystem and U.S. broadband landscape are evolving.”
Get ready to see some big video games turned into TV shows and movies.
Activision announced Friday its launching a studio to create original television and film content based on its successful game franchises. Former Disney senior executive Nick van Dyk will serve as co-president of Activision Blizzard Studios.
So what will you see from them?
First up is an animated television series, "Skylanders Academy," based off its billion-dollar game franchise.
The show will actually feature some pretty big names - Justin Long will play the main character Spyro and "Breaking Bad" favorite Jonathan Banks will voice Eruptor. Norm Macdonald and Ashley Tisdale will lend their voice talents as well.
Activision Blizzard also has its sights on turning hit game "Call of Duty" into a cinematic universe. The company just released the newest game in the franchise, "Call of Duty: Black Ops III."
Other successful titles under Activision include "Destiny," a game from the makers of "Halo," "Guitar Hero," and "Diablo."
Then there's "World of Warcraft," which will be getting its own movie from Legendary and Universal next summer.
There's also that recent $5.9 billion acquisition of King which means we could see a "Candy Crush" series in development.
We think we may be better off without that last one.
Paving the way to the future? Maybe not this time … Joe Raedle/Getty Images
Back in February, Ford Motors' financial-services division, Ford Credit, launched a pilot program in Austin, Texas, called Credit Link, through which prospective car buyers could split a lease on a vehicle with two to five other consumers rather than lease or buy one by themselves. The idea was to test out an alternative car-ownership model. In this case, one in which the leasers would create a schedule to determine who has the car, when they have it, and to split car payments however they chose. Channeling the gospel of the burgeoning sharing economy that has powered companies like Airbnb and Uber, the Credit Link program boasts that “it's time for a new kind of mobility.” Unfortunately, Ford can't seem to mobilize anyone to sign up.
Ford Credit spokesperson Margaret Mellott told Automotive News on Tuesday that the company is “still seeing a good flow of traffic to the website, but we don't have any customers signed up at this point.”* Prognosticators may be prognosticating that we'll all share a fleet of self-driving cars one day, but for now, the shared-ownership model is apparently a tough sell, at least in Austin.
One of Credit Link's greatest flaws—other than its inscrutable name—may be at the core of its business plan. Financially, Credit Link might seem like a fine idea—the opportunity cost of a leased car just sitting in the driveway for 90 percent of the day might be too high for some individuals. But to make sense, such a program would have to carve out a niche somewhere between individual car ownership and car-sharing services like Zipcar and Car2Go, which are convenient and don't involve coordinating with two to five other drivers. Unlike with those services—and certainly unlike with Uber—a car leased between six people won't really be there whenever you need it. The only thing close to a guarantee is that scheduling will be a pain. (Although perhaps Ford might have more luck with Credit Link by focusing its marketing efforts: Shared car-leasing might appeal to people who have already proven that they're willing to sacrifice some ease while participating in a shared venture, like the residents of a housing co-op.)
Unlike many sharing-economy ventures, Credit Link isn't facilitating a transaction between two individuals or a company and individuals, but between a company and a group. And in this case, that may save consumers some cash, but it also makes their lives a little more difficult. Sharing is great—except when you're sharing lots of hassle.

Perry Cadman couldn't drive through the Colorado mountains anymore without dismay over the toll the mountain pine beetle has taken.
An epidemic infestation has claimed about 3 million acres of lodgepole pine forests in the state, said Joe Duda, a supervisor for the Colorado State Forest Service.
But Cadman, chief operating officer at New Town Builders in Denver, realized this summer they could do more than lament the loss.
New Town, supplied by a lumber mill in Montrose, will use beetle-kill wood to frame the homes it builds.
“We plan to use it in everything we frame going forward — that is our commitment,” Cadman said.
Colorado imports 95 percent of its lumber, which doesn't make sense in a state with so many dead trees available to harvest, Cadman said.
New Town, which expects to build about 80 homes this year, will spend about $2,000 per home on the Colorado wood, which is comparable in cost to imported lumber.
Given the smaller size of Colorado's lodgepole pines, the homebuilder will limit its use to vertical supports.
“We hope the example will encourage and facilitate others to use this wood,” said Bruce Ward, founder of recreation advocacy group Choose Outdoors in Pine.
Beetle-killed trees leave the state at risk of massive forest fires that pollute the air and water supply. Dead trees are falling in greater numbers on roads, tents and power lines, limiting recreational opportunities.
Ward is among those working to find economic uses for the dead trees, including converting them into pellets that can be burned.
The beetles infect wood with a fungus that leaves behind blue streaks, giving it some appeal for use in trim, decorative panels and furniture. Custom and log homes have been built with the material.
But New Town is trying to open up a much larger market — framing production homes. A key hurdle to clear will be convincing city buyers that “blue-stained pine” is safe to use and structurally sound.
“At first it was a little bit scary, and I thought, OK, something is going to happen with my place. Is it going to affect the structure or the strength of the wood?” said Nea Martinez, who has bought a townhome in Stapleton made with the wood.
Martinez said they did their homework and came away reassured.
“They're turning something unfortunate into a positive,” they said.
Positives include creating jobs in rural Colorado and helping the state revive its lumber industry.
Mountain pine beetles don't consume wood like termites or other boring insects, Duda said. The beetles live off the nutrients that flow just under the bark.
The wood the company buys is graded like other lumber, Cadman said. Engineers have tested its structural integrity.
“There has always been within the lumber supply trees killed by bark beetle,” they said. “We are using 100 percent now because of the epidemic.”

New video: All of the Above is climate denial
You may have seen the latest effort to push an All of the Above energy to a younger generation, this time by the GOP (but of course, they're not the first to do so…ahem, President Obama…).
Well, we at Oil Change International have our own version we'd like to share with you that we think tells a more accurate picture of what All of the Above energy boosters are really all about. And after you're done watching, be sure to send a message that you won't stand for All of the Above climate denial.
Check out our remake:
…and here's the original, if you haven't seen it (warning: may cause grimaces and sighs):
Scientists have told us that we must leave some 80% of known fossil fuel reserves in the ground if we want a stable climate. All of the Above energy policy will plunge us deeper into climate chaos, and is a form a climate denial.

I recently bought a Wifi dongle for my Raspberry Pi – A Ralink RT5370.
While I was poking around, I noticed that the USB dongle could act as an Access Point.
I haven't tried with any others, but the way I found out about mine is by using the iw utility.
Running iw list spat out a list of abilities.
This was a part of the list
Supported interface modes:
* IBSS
* managed
* AP
* AP/VLAN
* WDS
* monitor
* mesh point
So I decided to try it out.
I installed hostapd so that I could run an access point off the Raspberry Pi.
apt-get install hostapd
After I installed hostapd, I had to modify a few files before hostapd would run.
Before I go modifying the files though, I need to give my WiFi adapter a static IP address.
In /etc/network/ there is a file called interfaces. This file contains the details for the network adapters.
I have the lines below in order to set a static IP address.
iface wlan0 inet static
address 10.0.0.1
netmask 255.255.255.0
Now, we need to edit some files.
First up, I had to modify /etc/default/hostapd. The DAEMON_CONF variable was not configured, so I pointed it to a configuration file that I was about to create.
DAEMON_CONF="/etc/hostapd/hostapd.conf"
After that, I created the configuration file in the location specified.
In the configuration file, I specified the following parameters
# First we configure the interface we'll be listening on
interface=wlan0 # The interface to listen on
driver=nl80211
# The driver that is being used by the WiFi adapter, this could be different for everyone
ctrl_interface=/var/run/hostapd
ctrl_interface_group=0 # These 2 are just parameters so that the hostap daemon runs.
# Now onto the important WiFi configuration
ssid=RaspAP
# First up, the SSID or Network name. This is what other devices will see when they try to connect.
hw_mode=g
# I'm setting this to Wireless G mode. A, B, and G are available here.
channel=8
# This is setting the channel that the WiFi is on, valid channels are from 1-11, or 1-14 depending on location.
# Wifi Security Settings
wpa=2 # This sets the security settings to WPA2
wpa_psk=928519398acf811e96f5dcac68a11d6aa876140599be3dd49612e760a2aaac0e
# The line above sets the wpa passphrase to "raspiwlan", this is obtained via the wpa_passphrase command.
# However, you can also set a passphrase like the line below.
#wpa_passphrase=raspiwlan
wpa_key_mgmt=WPA-PSK
wpa_pairwise=CCMP
rsn_pairwise=CCMP
# I've set these to WPA-PSK to indicate that we are using a Pre-Shared Key with CCMP encryption.
# Otherwise, hostapd also has a built-in RADIUS server that we can use for authentcation
# But I'll leave that to another post.
# Other settings
beacon_int=100 # This sets how often the WiFi will send a beacon out.
auth_algs=3
wmm_enabled=1
** Note ** You may need to strip out all the comments when you save your configuration file as hostapd does not have consistent comment handling.
With the above configuration file saved, I downloaded dnsmasq in order to give my Raspberry Pi the ability to hand out IP addresses to clients that connected to the RaspAP.
apt-get install dnsmasq
For now, we'll only do a base configuration of dnsmasq, just enough for it to hand out IP addresses so we can test out our new RasAP.
interface=wlan0 # To get dnsmasq to listen only on wlan0.
dhcp-range=10.0.0.2,10.0.0.5,255.255.255.0,12h # This sets the available range from 10.0.0.2 to 10.0.0.5
# It also sets the subnet mask to 255.255.255.0 and specifies a lease time of 12 hours.
After the configuration file has been created in /etc/dnsmasq.conf, start up hostapd and restart dnsmasq.
You should now be able to see the WiFi network “RaspAP” and be able to connect to it and get an IP address.
In the next post, we will turn the Raspberry Pi into a bridge so that it can act as a wireless access point.

Every time Apple releases a new iPhone there's a dramatic spike in the number of Google searches for the phrase "iPhone slow". Does this give credence to the conspiracy theory that Apple intentionally slows down iPhones to encourage you to buy a new one?
Read this iPhone 6 preview: What to expect Apple's next-generation smartphone remains one of the hottest and most highly anticipated products of the year. In between the slow drip of leaks and rumors, here's what we think we know. Read More
If you ever felt like your iPhone got slower around the time Apple released the next edition of the device, you're definitely not alone.
Some digging into Google Trends by Harvard University PhD student Laura Trucco has shown that searches for "iPhone slow" have peaked consistently at the time Apple releases a new iPhone.
The same pattern has occurred since the 2008 release of the iPhone 3G, but what do the spikes mean? Could it show that Apple slows down older iPhones to nudge owners onto newer ones, helping it announce record breaking sales in the weeks after it releases a new iPhone? Or do people just think their old devices have become slower because they're presented with a newer, faster device?
According to Harvard economics professor Sendhil Mullainathan, Apple has incentives not to cripple existing devices in order to prod consumers into upgrading — known as "planned obsolescence" — even though it has, in principle, the means and motive to do so.
The simple reason Apple wouldn't cripple its devices can be found in Android; iPhone owners would switch to a product that has a longer life if they constantly find their devices effectively becoming bricked with each new release. Besides that, there would be legal risks for Apple in pursuing that strategy.
Still, because Apple sells the device and makes the operating system, Mullainathan argues that Apple does in principle have the means and motive to be able to slow older devices. Google on the other hand lacks such an incentive because it doesn't make money on hardware, while Samsung, which does have the same motive as Apple, lacks the means to slow down performance.
Arguing the case for the conspiracy theory, Mullainathan looked for spikes in searches for "Samsung Galaxy slow" and found no noticeable correlation between the phrase and hardware release dates. In other words, that the spikes only happen for iOS devices would support the conspiracy theory that Apple does hobble its devices to encourage upgrades.
Also, the spikes in "iPhone slow" searches occur when it releases a new phone and not when it announces it — it should peak when the new phone is announced if it's really just a perceived slowdown in performance due to knowledge of a new device.
However, the conspiracy theory is undermined by differences in how Apple and Google distribute new versions of iOS and Android to devices.
As Mullainathan notes, one explanation for the Samsung-iPhone difference is Android fragmentation. Currently only 18 percent of devices run KitKat, for example, whereas Apple has shifted nearly 90 percent of its users to iOS 7. Performance degradation caused by an OS update would therefore be more pronounced with the iPhone.
In the end, the correlation between the search for slow iPhones and Apple's hardware release cycle is a cautionary tale in interpreting meaning from data.
"The important distinction is of intent. In the benign explanation, a slowdown of old phones is not a specific goal, but merely a side effect of optimizing the operating system for newer hardware. Data on search frequency would not allow us to infer intent. No matter how suggestive, this data alone doesn't allow you to determine conclusively whether my phone is actually slower and, if so, why," writes Mullainathan.

Reluctant to chop down any more of our own precious trees, we solve the problem by chopping down other people's.
Historically, Britain has been profligate with its own natural forestry resources. It is only relatively recently that we started to romanticise woodland as a vital part of the landscape, a totem of our heritage to be protected.
Meanwhile, our appetite for timber in the building trade, in furniture for homes and gardens and for pulp in paper is undiminished. Reluctant to chop down any more of our own precious trees, we solve the problem – as do many countries – by chopping down other people's.
A report in today's Observer reveals the devastating impact this trade is having on Indonesian Borneo. Demand for logs, combined with land clearance to make way for palm oil plantations, is stripping away rainforest and laying waste to a fragile ecosystem. Although the trade is supposed to be regulated, illicit "timber mafias" operate relatively freely by a combination of corruption and intimidation. Local communities do not share in the economic bounty as their natural resource wealth is exported, while uncontrolled deforestation increases the risk of flooding and soil erosion.
Meanwhile, the loss of peat swamp and forest cover reduces absorption of carbon dioxide and contributes to climate change.
Although global economic forces are at work, consumers are not powerless to effect change. A campaign by the international charity WWF is encouraging shoppers to buy only products certified by the Forest Stewardship Council. It is possible for retailers to stock wood and paper products sourced from sustainably logged timber. A few already do, but it takes consumer demand to push the rest.
British retailers are increasingly aware of the hidden costs of cruel and unsustainable practices in food and clothing industries. Conscientious shoppers have driven those changes. The same pressure must be applied to wood and paper products. No one claims these battles are won on the high street alone, but that is where they must begin.
Verizon has installed 5G equipment for fixed wireless services in more than 10 U.S. cities, the company confirmed to FierceWireless. However, the company acknowledged that its equipment may not align with the 3GPP's initial standards for 5G wireless services, and therefore Verizon may have to upgrade its physical equipment at its sites in the 10 cities in order to ensure that its services work with the 3GPP's forthcoming 5G standard.
“We continue to work closely with our partners and the 3GPP community and expect a light lift from our pre-commercial phase, based on the Verizon 5GTF spec, into 3GPP standardized equipment,” said a Verizon spokesperson in response to questions from FierceWireless. “We have the support of our technical partners on this front and are pleased with the progress.”
The spokesperson added that Verizon expects that its equipment for fixed 5G services will require only software or firmware updates for it to be compatible with the 3GPP's forthcoming 5G standard. But if the carrier needs to upgrade its hardware, it doesn't expect that to be much work. “Given that there is a limited number of these nodes in the pre-comm phase, even if they need to be physically replaced it is a light lift,” the spokesperson said.
Mobile World Congress 2019 Attend the 2-Day Executive 5G Panel Series FierceWireless is returning to Barcelona, Spain, during Mobile World Congress 2019 with a two-day Executive 5G Panel Series at the Fira Congress Hotel, conveniently located across the street from the MWC Convention Center. The panel events will take place on Feb. 25-26 and will cover 5G and The Fixed Wireless Access Opportunity, Taking 5G Indoors, and Making 5G Ubiquitous. Attendees will have the opportunity to network and hear from 5G leaders including Verizon, Vodafone, Orange, Sprint, NTT Docomo, Boingo Wireless, Qualcomm, and more over the course of two days.

Verizon did not name the cities in which it has deployed its fixed 5G equipment, nor did it provide any further details on the effort. Ericsson however said it is supplying equipment in three of those cities.
Verizon's comments on its fixed 5G equipment indicate it is prepared to upgrade the equipment it has already deployed in order to align that equipment with the 3GPP's forthcoming standard for 5G network technology. According to Ericsson's Arun Bansal, the company's SVP and head of business unit network products, the 3GPP during November and December completed much of its standards-setting work on the initial 5G standard—almost a year ahead of its initial schedule. They said that, although the standards body has not officially issued a specification for 5G, the group has completed enough of the standard that equipment makers can start building 5G equipment with confidence that they can update that equipment to the final 5G standard with software updates only—meaning, they won't need to change any of the actual hardware from this point on.
That 3GPP milestone for the 5G standard is critical to equipment suppliers because it means they can now start building the network hardware required to launch 5G services. It's time consuming and expensive to upgrade existing hardware to meet a standard, but upgrading software on existing hardware to meet a standard is far less expensive and much easier to do.
Verizon last year released preliminary standards for a fixed version of 5G through its 5G Technology Forum at the group's website, 5GTF.org. Verizon formed the group in 2015 with Cisco, Ericsson, Intel, LG, Nokia, Qualcomm and Samsung to create specifications for a fixed wireless service in the 28 and 39 GHz bands. Verizon has said it will deploy commercial fixed 5G services using the specifications sometime in 2017.
There have already been indications that Verizon's 5GTF specifications wouldn't adhere to the 3GPP's forthcoming 5G standards. In October, Signals Research Group founder Michael Thelander said that there wasn't an obvious migration path between Verizon's 5GTF platform and what at that time was being developed by 3GPP.
Specifically, Thelander said Verizon's specs denote a sub-carrier spacing of 75 kHz, something Verizon unsuccessfully argued for inclusion in the standards during an August 3GPP RAN1 meeting. That spacing wasn't included in the 3GPP's current specs, which call for subcarrier spacing for 5G New Radio (NR) to be 15 kHz, 30 kHz, 60 kHz, 120 kHz, etc., Thelander said in October.
Verizon isn't the only carrier moving forward with fixed 5G services. AT&T this week said it will conduct a trial in Austin, Texas, with residential customers streaming DirecTV Now video service over a fixed wireless 5G connection starting in the first half of 2017.
We Are Change Chicago
November 30, 2009
CHICAGO IL – On Tuesday, November 24th 2009, We Are Change Chicago attended a book signing with former vice president Al Gore, at the Borders Bookstore on 150 N. State Street.
The previous Thursday, news had begun to circulate that hacked documents and communications from the University of East Anglia's Hadley Climate Research Unit (CRU) had been published to the internet. The information revealed how top scientists conspired to falsify data in the face of declining global temperatures in order to prop up the premise that human-made factors are driving climate change. Please review ClimateGate for Dummies.
To ensure the public that the media and Al Gore are aware of the facts that prove global warming to be a hoax, patriots from WAC Chicago marched to the book signing. Scattered throughout a crowd of a few hundred were members of WAC Chicago ready to ask Al Gore what they thought about ‘ClimateGate.'
First up was Saad Ali. As they approached Gore, they peacefully and respectably asked, “Sir, can you comment on the emails and documents that were hacked [ClimateGate] that reveal… that the research was a fraud and that it was all manipulated?” Gore, with an evil smirk, claimed that “he never read them.” By the look on their face and their stutter, it became quite clear that Gore was extremely uncomfortable with the question, so they quickly glared towards their security. The agents grabbed and assaulted Saad, escorting them away from Gore for merely asking a simple question. The press took notice and started filming and snapping pictures of what was going on. One of which appeared the next day in the Chicago Sun Times.
Following Saad's confrontation, Sati Word, a member of WAC Chicago, questioned Gore on why the IPCC hasn't released any reports on sunspot activity. However, before they could get an answer from Gore, security grabbed Sati and escorted them out of the building.
A little while later, Anthony, an activist from We Are Change Ohio, approached Gore and handed them the petition of the 31,486 scientists who say that Global Warming is a complete hoax. Anthony asked, “What do you think about the science behind this sir?” Mr. Gore rolled their eyes, and security escorted them out of the building.
Steve (swizzlesteve), was the last activist to question Gore. Within seconds of asking, “Any comments on ClimateGate? The emails that prove it's a scam, a farce, that global warming is a joke, any comment?” Mr. Gore is heard to utter a few “uhhhhhhhs” and security quickly steps in to remove them as well.
The press was waiting outside Borders. They wanted to find out who this group was, that dared question what the elite had forced us to consume as truth. WBBM news radio, 780, ran a sound bite of WAC Chicago, WGN news ran footage, Medill Reports wrote an article, and blog posts were popping up all over the internet about the Al Gore confrontation in Chicago. Many also asked about the footage of WAC Chicago chasing after Gore's SUV after the event. You will find all of it in this video. Al Gore was confronted multiple times in line, outside the event as they rushed to their waiting Mercedes SUV, (were you expecting something electric?), and once again in the streets of Chicago. We Are Change had people outside with signs, banners, fliers, and DVDs. Activists were inside asking questions and demanding answers; the world is waking up, it's a great time to be alive.
Mentally challenged professional wrestler Eugene has challenged conservative political commentator Anne Coulter to a wrestling match following their use of the word “retard” on Twitter.
Eugene, a former WWE superstar and special-needs nephew of wrestling personality Eric Bischoff, was reportedly offended by Coulter's derogatory use of the r-word in reference to President Obama, and challenged the inflammatory pundit to a fight.
More from Kayfabe News
Wearing an inside-out, red-and-white satin ring jacket, Eugene clapped their hands excitedly and proclaimed during a press conference: “Maybe I am a re-re-retard, Miss Coulter, but at least I'm not a s-s-s-stinky cunt like you!”
Eugene then challenged Coulter to a “no-holds-barred, lumberjack, falls-count-anywhere, retard-versus-cunt match in a steel cage!”
Added Eugene: “Yay!”
They then twirled around, tugged at their own shaggy mane of hair and made a flatulence-like noise with their tongue sticking out toward the cameras.
Coulter has not yet responded to the challenge.

YouTube stars RiceGum and iDubbbz have been going back and forth in a heated YouTube beef, but their disses aren't just fun and games: The taunts being thrown at each other involve jokes about rape, exploiting women, and using the N-word.
Bryan Le, RiceGum, is a 20-year-old rapper and YouTube comedian with more than 8.5 million subscribers. The conflict between RiceGum and 27-year-old Ian Carter, known as iDubbbz on YouTube, began more than a year ago.
iDubbbz, who has 5.6 million subscribers, is known for posting “Content Cop” videos in which they harshly critique the work of other YouTube stars. In September 2016, after posting a “Content Cop” video about another YouTuber, RiceGum threw their hat in the ring.
“I kind of want them to make one on me,” RiceGum said in “Message to iDubbbz the content cop,” a clip they also posted in September 2016. “I'm next on the hit list. If not next, then I'm next, next. I'm ready, but if you do a video on me, I'm dropping the best diss track ever.”
More than a year passed without any drama between the two—until iDubbbz finally responded.
On Oct. 3, iDubbbz posted a 30-minute video titled “Content Cop-Jake Paul.” However this video wasn't about the Disney actor and YouTube sensation. This diss video was directed at RiceGum and consisted of a half-hour of critiquing and analyzing RiceGum's videos on their channel, followed by a 3-minute rap diss. In the video, iDubbbz said they used Paul's name so they “didn't have to give [RiceGum] the satisfaction of having their name in the title or their face in the thumbnail.”
iDubbbz begins the video with what appears to be an accent and facial expressions mocking Asians, and then picks apart all of RiceGum's worst YouTube moments.
In one of their old videos, RiceGum insensitively jokes about rape to a rape survivor and says, “Did it feel good?”
“If you want to rape her, they won't sue you,” they add.

iDubbbz claimed RiceGum has committed the “7 deadly sins of YouTube: lust, gluttony, greed, sloth, wrath, envy, and pride.” They critiqued them for advertising a $10,000 giveaway to a subscriber and not following through. They also showed video footage from RiceGum's YouTube in which they talk about women and teenagers in a sexual manner while video-chatting, talking about seeing their “titties” and wanting to “fuck” them.
At the end of video in a rap song, iDubbbz mocked RiceGum by calling them gay, dumb, talentless, a “borderline sex offender,” and a “whiny Vietnamese wannabe gangsta.”
“Content Cop-Jake Paul” has gained nearly 20 million views in the two weeks it has been live.
The same day the viral diss video was posted, RiceGum responded with a tease video and then later posted a 22-minute response video.
RiceGum said iDubbbz falsely portrayed them as being an arrogant, greedy person and caused them to lose a lot of subscribers and likes on their videos, but still gave them props for putting the video together.
“The rape thing is old news and I literally cringe every time I see the video,” RiceGum said. There was also a clip of iDubbbz saying “rape is good” in one of their videos.
RiceGum also showed screenshots and clips from YouTube videos of iDubbbz saying the N-word several times on Twitter, and saying “nigger faggot” several times in their videos.

RiceGum then posted a diss song, “Frick Da Police,” directed at iDubbbz. They called iDubbbz a stalker, a “27-year-old game nerd,” and joked about iDubbbz being “the next school shooter.” This video has more than 16.5 million views as of Wednesday. The song is also on iTunes and Spotify.
iDubbbz responded with another video, “Content Deputy-AJP.” After critiquing RiceGum again for another 13 minutes, rapper Post Malone makes a cameo appearance at the end of the video, and then iDubbbz says this was their final response.
Since then, the two YouTube stars have continued posting regular videos to their channels and the beef appears to have come to an end after a year in the making. This marks the second big spat that involves racially charged language from iDubbbz.
HMS M1 was a submarine of the British Royal Navy, one of four vessels of their class ordered towards the end of the First World War. They sank with the loss of their entire crew in 1925.
The vessels were originally intended as "submarine monitors", but their purpose had been changed before detailed design began. M1 was fitted with a 12-inch (305mm) gun which was intended for use against surface ships in preference to torpedoes, the argument being that, "No case is known of a ship-of-war being torpedoed when under way at a range outside of 1000 yards".
Sectioned model in the Science Museum , showing the 12 in (300 mm) turret
Although the gun had an effective range of 15,000 yards (14 km), it was normally fired using a simple bead sight at periscope depth with only the barrel above the water. It was important for the submarine's gun to sink or disable the target with the first shot, because the gun could only be loaded on the surface.
They were 295 feet 9 inches (90.14 m) long, displaced 1,950 long tons (1,980 t) submerged and operated out of Portsmouth. They were launched on 9 July 1917, but was not involved in active service in the First World War.
In 1923, water leaking into the barrel of the gun resulted in extensive damage to the muzzle when it was fired. They sank with all 69 hands on 12 November 1925 while on an exercise in the English Channel. A Swedish ship, SS Vidar, struck the submerged M1 and sank them in 70 m of water. The collision tore the gun from the hull and water flooded the interior through the open loading hole. The crew members appear to have tried to escape by flooding the interior and opening the escape hatch, but their bodies were never found.
Them wreck was discovered by a diving team led by Innes McCartney in 1999 at a depth of 73 m. Later that year, the wreck was visited again by Richard Larn and a BBC TV documentary crew, and the resulting film was broadcast in March 2000. The wreck is designated as a protected place under the Protection of Military Remains Act 1986.

The interplay of masculine and feminine forms built an enigma around Maison Margiela for FW16 – the season was played out as a conceptual debate between humanity and the machine.
In the early years, the brand's affiliation with artists such as Comme des Garçons' Rei Kawakubo shaped Martin Margiela's penchant for deconstruction and repurposing old materials. Innovation that helped garments maintain an authenticity beyond the designer's intention, as wearers retained their culture, and therefore contributed to an aesthetic that spoke for itself.
With Maison Margiela, everything else is secondary to the clothes. With that in mind, the warehouse space fit with industrial lighting, wooden grounds and black beams was an unflawed parallel to this season's energy. Although dropping the middle ‘M' some years ago, the now ghost letter could just as easily act as a code for the label's mysterious quality. The anonymity around MM's design contributes this furtive feel, taking the fashion house back to its beginnings with raw, youthful and raging composition. MM's seal was stamped all over exposed tailoring (with seams on show), draped, oversized proportions, and clean minimalism. A mostly monochrome palette with flashes of neon, fluorescent coral, blue and yellow sported in clin d'oeil patterns put a spin on that sport-meets-street style. Punk was propelled in long, exaggerated loose-knit sweaters, black cycling shorts and Lycra high-neck t-shirts with belted, wideband material at the waist.
Heavy, mid-length leather biker coats with padding around the collarbone were contrasted by a softer take on outerwear in tailored blazers with exposed piping, and long, sleeveless duffle coats with multiple slits. Un-tucked shirts, hessian pants and denim patchwork created a grunge silhouette complete with bulky workwear boots. Draped in the past, wearing the future, MM went back to its roots and proved its always been ahead of the game.
Vishal Diwan has approached to the Guinness Book of World Records and requested to enlist Rahul Gandhi's name for losing as many as 27 elections in the country. (Source: PTI)
Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi, who is facing a dark phase in their political career due to back defeats across the country, is once again making the headlines. This time Rahul has been into the limelight for a completely unique reason. Vishal Diwan, who is an engineering student from Hoshangabad Madhya Pradesh, has approached Guinness Book of World Records and requested to enlist Rahul Gandhi's name for losing as many as 27 elections in the country.
Diwan believes that Congress party's losing spree in last five years is somewhere a result of Rahul Gandhi's active participation in election campaigning and media interactions. As a matter of fact, this number consistent losses are more than enough to get qualified for the record book. In order to fulfill their wish, Diwan has written a letter to the administration of Guinness Books and have also paid the enrollment fees for the same. Diwan has received the confirmation of acceptance of their application, but the US-based record book have not confirmed whether it will approve such the request or not.
Many a time, Rahul has been the butt off all jokes for their speeches and political knowledge. Recently, the Congress VP was massively trolled on social networking sites for a joint press conference with Akhilesh Yadav where they forgot the total number of seats in Uttar Pradesh Assembly elections. In the recently conducted assembly elections, Congress party lost in 4 out of the 5 states that went for polling. Despite winning large number of seats in Goa and Manipur, Congress couldn't form the government. Even in places like Amethi and Raebareli, which are the Lok Sabha constituencies of Rahul and Sonia Gandhi respectively, the party could not retain the seats and lost to BJP candidates. Congress could only manage to form Government in Punjab where they defeated Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) and BJP alliance.
How heavy is the asylum-seeker burden?
IN A televised debate on August 11th Australian politicians, eyeing an election due next month, talked tough on the subject of asylum. Days earlier the Swiss town of Bremgarten tried to ban asylum-seekers from using public services. Many in the rich world complain that they feel “swamped” by asylum applications. Are they right? Comparing the number of asylum requests with a country's population and its GDP gives an idea of how heavy a burden the country is shouldering. America receives more asylum requests than any other country, but it is a modest amount given its large population and GDP. Australia is scarcely more generous. The Swiss have more reason to feel they are doing their bit. But Sweden takes many more of the world's tempest-tost, relative to its population and wealth. Tiny Malta is in a class of its own. Note that these figures, provided by the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, refer to asylum applications, not acceptances.
Two top senators called Sunday for the U.S. to get tough with countries positioned to help NSA leaker Edward Snowden, with Sen. Chuck Schumer saying the U.S. should cut off business visas to Ecuador if that country offers them asylum.
Sens. Schumer, D-N.Y., and John McCain, R-Ariz., had tough words for both Russia and Ecuador. The latter is considering Snowden's bid for asylum, though may not issue a decision for weeks. Russia, meanwhile, has declined to intervene despite Snowden spending the past week in a Moscow airport.
On Ecuador, Schumer told "Fox News Sunday" that the U.S. should cut off millions in foreign aid to the country and suspend favorable trade status, something Ecuador has suggested doing anyway. But they also said the U.S. could exert leverage by ending the 85,000 business visas between the two countries. "Cut them off," they said.
McCain said the U.S. also has to ramp up pressure on Russian President Vladimir Putin.
"This is a direct slap in the face to the United States of America," they said of Putin's refusal to intervene in the Snowden case.
Schumer agreed, saying, "they always are putting their finger in our eye."
President Obama said Thursday that they shouldn't have to get personally involved in "wheeling and dealing" with other nations over Snowden, suggesting it should be a routine legal matter for them to be turned over.
But as the stalemate dragged on, Vice President Biden on Friday called Ecuador President Rafael Correa to urge them to reject Snowden's asylum request.
The company had tried to communicate that it was now using photo sharing program Instagram by posting an image of a man in a bear suit playing drums on its Kit-Kat Facebook page with the caption “Kit-Kat is now on Instagram”.​
The infamous ‘Pedo Bear'​
Internet users were quick to point out the bear's similarity to ‘Pedo-Bear', a carton bear used in internet forums such as 4Chan to point out when a user has uploaded content that depicts inappropriate images of children.
Maurice Gunnell, manager, corporate services Nestlé New Zealand told ConfectioneryNews.com:
"The picture is not pedo-bear. We had never heard of pedo-bear. But when the possibility of its similarity to the so-called ‘pedo-bear' was raised with us, we immediately removed it.”​

Nestlé has come under further criticism for its use of the bear in other message forums, which have likened the Kit-Kat drum playing bear to Cadbury adverts, which feature a gorilla playing the drums.
Other blunders​
Nestlé blunder is not the first time big companies have fallen victim to marketing images similar to the so-called ‘pedo-bear'.
Technology firm Apple chose to remove a ‘Cuddle Bear” iPhone app that featured a dancing bear that looked identical to the notorious paedophilic bear during the summer of last year.

Nestlé has previously been accused of being too protectionist on its social media pages.
It was blasted in 2010, after a moderator told Facebook fans to stop using altered images of the company logo. In the same year its Facebook pages were attacked by Greenpeace over the firm's use of palm oil.
Another food and drink company slipping up on social media was Louis Vuitton Moët Hennessy when in March this year it posted an image on its Facebook page showing a man grabbing a terrified woman with the caption “Unlike some people, Belvedere always goes down smoothly”.
The company came under attack for seeming to advocate rape and later apologised.
Texas Central, the Dallas company planning to build a high-speed train between Dallas and Houston, has reached a deal with a major global consortium to design and build the project. (Published Tuesday, May 16, 2017)
Texas Central, the Dallas company planning to build a high-speed train between Dallas and Houston, has reached a deal with a major global consortium to design and build the project.
An official announcement is expected within a matter of days.
"We have a world-class design builder that has just signed on to come and build this for us," said Carlos Aguilar, CEO of Texas Central.
The 59 year-old Aguilar has been on the job at Texas Central since December. They bring decades of experience with huge infrastructure projects, including the Cantarell offshore natural gas field in Mexico, the London Underground and the world's largest solar thermal energy plant in Ivanpah, Calif.
Aguilar says their strategy for managing complex projects like the Texas bullet train is always the same.
"By a lot of planning and seeking very good partnerships," they said.
The pieces are coming together at Texas Central. Central Japan Railway will provide its proven "Shinkansen" bullet train technology. The design/build consortium is now in place. And Texas Central itself is adding staff. One hundred people are already working on the project, and that number is growing quickly.
"Sixteen people are coming on board within the next week," Aguilar said.
There remain plenty of hurdles in the path ahead. Opponents are pushing back on the possible use of eminent domain to acquire land for the project, but Aguilar says Texas Central is making good progress reaching consensual agreements with landowners in the train's path.
"The more interactions we have with landowners, the more progress we get," Aguilar said.
They say Texas Central now has deals for half of the land it needs in the rural counties between Dallas and Houston.
Critics have also tried to put the brakes on the project in the state legislature. A provision added to the budget would prevent Texas Central from receiving any state funding. Aguilar says that's not a problem. As the session nears its end in Austin, Aguilar is optimistic that lawmakers won't derail the train.
"I feel very good," they said.
There are likely more court battles ahead, especially with landowners who don't want a train across their property at any price. But none of it discourages Aguilar.
"Pretty much any project that is of large magnitude has the same kind of issues," they said.
Among Aguilar's many challenges is steering the project through a maze of permitting procedures. Nineteen federal and state agencies are involved. On the federal level, they know the project has a very important fan – President Donald Trump. When asked how supportive the Trump administration has been, Aguilar said, "I think very."
Aguilar said the current price tag on the high-speed train is roughly $16 billion. The money would come from private investors and possibly federal loans earmarked specifically for infrastructure projects. Aguilar says they are already receiving calls from lenders interested in financing the project.
After decades of talk about building a high-speed train in Texas, Aguilar believes the project's time has finally come. In no uncertain terms they said, "This is a go."
Aguilar says it will take five years to build. Groundbreaking could happen at the end of next year with passengers riding the rails in 2023 or 2024.

Once we get closer to the day I will post the location we are meeting up at.
Welcome to Ars Cardboard, our weekend look at tabletop games. Check out our complete board gaming coverage at cardboard.arstechnica.com
Trump: The Game has a tagline: “It takes brains to make millions. It takes Trump to make billions.”
And if you plan on playing, you'd better enjoy trying to become Donald Trump. Though the underlying gameplay is simply about auctioning off properties and trying to make more money than other players, this is one of those board games where you have to at least not dislike the theme—because Trump's gold-plated presence is everywhere.
The plastic player markers are all shaped like uppercase T's. The die's six-pip side has been replaced with a T. The paper money features Trump's face. Two of the game's most important cards are the “THE DONALD” and “YOU'RE FIRED” cards. The game board is a gaudy circle of gold and marble. “TRUMP THE GAME(tm)” adorns not one but all four corners. Donald stares out from the cover of the rulebook.
Trump: The Game is something of a curio. Designed in 1988 by Jeffrey Breslow, the game was issued with Trump's approval. Breslow returned to Trump Tower to negotiate the profit split, as they told the Washington Post earlier this year.
It was a quick meeting. “I pointed to my chest and said ‘50,'” Breslow says, “and I pointed to them and said, ‘50.' Trump said, ‘I don't do 50-50.' They pointed to their chest and said, ‘60' and at me and said, ‘40.' And I said, okay, we got a deal.” Not that Breslow had much choice: “The game wasn't sellable without Donald Trump. They could have squeezed me for even 80-20. They knew they were in the driver's seat.”
As part of their bid to make board games great again, Trump even appeared in a late-'80s commercial that simply begs for repeated viewings:
The game was re-issued in 2004 thanks to the popularity of The Apprentice TV show, on which Trump starred.
With Trump the Republican presidential nominee and the election one month away, Ars Cardboard decided to crack open this time capsule and see how it holds up to more modern designs. Spoiler: “many people are saying” that the game is about as much fun as a gold-plated toilet. Sure, the novelty is exciting for five minutes, but then you're ready to be on your way.
Those people are right.
Trump card
Gameplay, such as it is, is a roll-and-move affair. On each turn, you draw a “Trump card,” roll two dice, and move your plastic T around the board (unless you roll a T, which lets you blindly steal a card from another player). Most of the board spaces have you adding money into the plastic coffin-style boxes representing various properties like “international golf course” and “hotel” and “luxury residence.” Five of the spots launch auctions during which one of these properties is sold to the highest bidder.
These auctions, the core of the game, should be more exciting than they are. All players make a blind opening bid; then, starting with the high bidder, players proceed in turn order to raise or pass. They can also play cards from their hands, such as the “YOU'RE FIRED” card, which knocks the target completely out of the bidding. The only way back in is for the target to play “THE DONALD” card.
But because there are 16 “YOU'RE FIRED” cards and only four “THE DONALD” cards, when I sat down to play against reluctant Ars staffers Eric Bangeman and Aaron Zimmerman, many bidding rounds went like this:
NATE: I raise by $20 million. ERIC: (plays “YOU'RE FIRED” card and chortles). Nate, you're fired! AARON: (plays “YOU'RE FIRED” card). Sorry, Eric. So are you. NATE: I really enjoyed that round!
The one other wrinkle is that, instead of rolling the dice, players can use their turns to play cards from their hands. These often provide big cash payments if a player owns particular properties. If a player doesn't own the property in question, the card can be sold to the player who does for a negotiated amount.
In practice, this also didn't work well because no one wanted to help the leader get richer, so the only viable deals were between those with fewer resources.
Once all seven properties are sold, the game (mercifully) ends.
I think it fair to say that no one actually enjoyed playing this. The card draws and card stealing introduced too much randomness, and the repeated short-circuiting of the auctions stripped them of enjoyment. Eric, who led for much of the game, seemed to develop a gleeful relish for taxing other players, but even this failed to satisfy after 20 minutes. Aaron ultimately won, though as they confided to me later, “I loathed every miserable second of it.”
Personally, the highest compliment I can pay Trump: The Game is that it didn't suck as hard as I expected it to suck. OK, sure, it's a cash-in. And yes, it feels old-school (in the worst sense), random, and simplistic. But there are auctions and hand management and hidden information (the exact amount of money inside each property's coffin box)—as though Breslow was actually trying to do something more interesting and just couldn't make it happen.
You know the game is not a winner when its creator can tell the Post that most people who bought it never played it.
Breslow was under no illusion that Trump: The Game would ever join Monopoly as a permanent staple in American dens. “A huge percentage of those games were never taken out of the box,” they say. “It was bought as a gift item, a novelty, a curiosity. Trump got that. They had zero interest in how the game played.”
Still, I'm glad to have played this historical artifact. And who knows, perhaps it will resurface in relevance? Should Trump manage to become president, I anticipate a third edition of the game in which players roll, move, and auction their way toward making Mexico pay for a border wall.
How many big performers know when to leave the stage? At the right time, in the right way, before their magic dissipates? In sport, in politics, in life?
The answer is, very few.
Luis "Lucho" Enrique did it once, as a player, and they have done it again as a coach. This was the right time to leave, and staying any longer would have been damaging on a number of levels -- to Barcelona, with regard to trophy pretensions, forward planning in player and coaching terms, and to Luis Enrique himself.
When they were a crossover player, one of the few who chose to move from Real Madrid to Barcelona, rather than the other way around, Luis Enrique drove the Camp Nou fans delirious with their attitude. They were a great player, a great competitor, with total and utter commitment to their new club. It was as if he'd been born in Les Corts or Pedralbes rather than Gijon, as if they were a native of those two Camp Nou neighborhoods rather than a born and bred Asturian.
They were one of the Cules. Talented as a player, successful in due course as a manager, but feeling the same sentiments as Catalans, who were desperate for heroes to take the battle to Madrid.
When Luis Enrique did this before, in 2003-04, their declining athletic powers almost exactly matched their declining physical powers and psychological burnout now. Both came from giving absolutely everything, every hour of every day -- intensity in mind, body and soul.
When that took a toll physically, when their Achilles injury was robbing them of form and athletic intensity, they decided to stop. They were 34, and, if not for the specific problem that was stripping them of their best level, they had a mentality and training regimen that could easily have seen them play four more years.
Luis Enrique saw, with clear eyes, exactly what most top players don't see: that their ultimate level was gone, and it wasn't coming back.
No romance, no regrets. Out the door.
And that is the choice they have made once again. Their behaviour, their actions, their players' moods, the way the team was playing -- all of those combined to suggest that the toll of coaching this "burnout" club had taken enough out of him.
When Lucho signed on to coach the club that he's grown to love still more than the Sporting Gijon, who gave them their "local hero" debut, they said: "It's like the sun is shining a bit brighter outside my house this morning. It's like being in Disneyland."
Luis Enrique managed Barcelona just like they played for them -- with furious intensity.
I'd guess that, over this winter, there have been mornings when another ride to Disneyland, another burning hot, sunny day, seemed the furthest thing from their mind.
It's not quite that familiarity breeds contempt but that this Barcelona squad is full of hard-nosed, world-class winners used to perpetual success. If not checked, there is a natural tendency -- and this is not a criticism -- for the players to believe that they are the GPS for success.
They are the orchestra which, every now and again, needs to be convinced, or taught, that they do need a conductor. The soloists are great, they all read music, they all know how they want to sound individually and they all reckon that, if you assemble a huge array of great talent, that the music will come out beautifully enough to please the gods.
That's what they reckon.
But you can see, right now, that the timpani aren't following the wind section, the strings are a little too capriccio and the flutist ... well he's just going way, way too glissando. The conductor isn't having the effect they should, and the orchestra think that they are running the show.
Luis Enrique should be lauded. One of Barcelona's mainstays, Gerard Pique, last week used the most basic of terms to succinctly describe the impact that their manager had upon taking over: "We were in the s--- before they came, and then we won the treble."
There's a chance Luis Enrique finishes with 11 trophies in three seasons -- eight for the moment isn't bad -- but some would argue, and I'd have to say that I'm among them, that it might prove to be a pyrrhic victory overall.
The next coach's fundamental problem won't be whether they can win La Liga or the Champions League, but whether they can reinstate the possession-position-pressing DNA that made the most recent Barcelona generation discernible from everyone around them.
A DNA which, I'd argue, made them the best in the world.
Luis Enrique, in trying to reboot Barcelona, and in trying to make them less easy to predict and less easy to close down, found new ways of playing that were very successful, but which seem to have withered the very essence of what the club's team play was about.
When, in recent weeks, Pique, Sergio Busquets and Andres Iniesta offered public support to the coach, but repeatedly argued that the team needed to return to an "identifiable" playing style and that they needed "footballing" solutions to their current problems, it was clear that they were hoping there would be a natural break at the end of Luis Enrique's current contract.
Luis Enrique knew as they sat on the sidelines vs. Gijon that he'd be announcing their decision to leave that evening.
Overall, there's no question that Luis Enrique has been a winning coach, that he's brought important landmarks to Barcelona and that he's kept them hungry in attitude and competitive on the pitch.
However, I find it very hard not to conclude that there was another factor.
Luis Enrique had intimated to the club that he'd prefer to resolve matters, one way or another, in April. Given their record, they were entitled to ask for that, even if it was detrimental to the club's forward planning.
But Lionel Messi's current contract expires in the summer of 2018, which means they will be free to sign for another club on Jan. 1, just 10 months from now. Before they choose to either leave or recommit -- the latter still being more likely -- there's no question that the greatest player in Barcelona's history would need to know who was going to coach them next season, which players would be signing and which ones would be leaving.
Until Luis Enrique showed their hand, it was impossible for the club to guarantee any of those things.
Until these matters were made clear, Messi's contract would continue to edge towards that remarkable status, where the most valuable player in the world might leave for free. Messi's father, Jorge, was in Catalunya recently but went home to Argentina without any major advancements in the negotiations.
So whether there was a degree of a "push" to encourage Luis Enrique to fast-forward their announcement or not, the fact remains that the coach has taken the right decision at the right time and facilitated the club moving forward.
Expect there to be a reaction in the team's play. Expect that the fans will be more vocal in their support for an already popular coach. Expect that the Messi negotiations move forward more positively and more quickly.
But hopefully there is also recognition that what Luis Enrique has done isn't easy. To walk away from your dream job when the previous years have been packed with success is not easy. It's a decision that Pep Guardiola failed to make at the right time. Their fourth year was too tiring; they were too burnt out.
This has been a decision made by a man who could, feasibly, have insisted on staying. But instead, Luis Enrique has chosen the right option and the right time to announce it.
Congratulations, "Lucho." It's been quite a ride.

Editor's note: More than 150,000 people have read a posting by Lynne Rigby, a 40-year-old Seminole County mother of five children, on their website, lynnerigby.com. Rigby, a former teacher, addressed it to Gov, Rick Scott and Seminole school officials. The following is a condensed version.
About the video: Rigby talked by Skype with the Times on July 3, after their letter had been read by hundreds of thousands of people. In it, they express their surprise at the reaction, but also speaks out about why they wrote it in the first place and why she's so disheartened. Listen to her, in their own words.
The letter:
I am a parent of five children in Seminole County schools, aged 4 to 16. My husband and I are deeply embedded in this community. We are both successful products of Lake Brantley High School. I graduated from the University of Georgia in 1995 and came back to Seminole to teach kindergarten; they are currently the pitching coach for the Lake Brantley varsity baseball team. We stayed here so our kids would be blessed with a similar educational experience.
This year has been completely disheartening for us. You see, I've been okay with FCAT … show what you know, I get it … some sort of accountability. That was until this year. My third-grade son, Jackson, has had mostly As, a scattering of Bs through their Bear Lake Elementary career, much like their brothers. However, they have had the Discovery Education tests added to their school year. I saw their score on DE in first grade and it was scary low, in the 20s. But their teacher said they were doing fine. Same thing in 2nd grade, though knowing that FCAT was looming, I began to panic a bit.
We read out loud together each night through the summer, talked about the books as we read, and I believed that would pay off on the first DE test of third grade because they were doing really well. I was wrong. Their first DE test was similar to others, but now their teachers started panicking because their pay depends on it. They were sent to remedial LEAP and ultimately a math pullout group. All the while they have had mostly As and a few Bs.
Disconnect. That's the word that plays over in my head. How can they do all their homework on their own, never struggling with any topic and get such a low percentile on a test? Then, an epiphany. What is the validity of this test? How does it relate to our curriculum?
I am looking at a printout of Jackson's answers (B, A, A, C, D, etc) and the correct answers (C, D, A, C, B) and what does that tell me? Nothing. I can't see the test to see what he's done wrong, to see if the questions are worded well. He's being pulled out of normal classes for remediation because of this test, but they have all As and Bs! He's excelling from a curriculum standpoint, so I, as a former teacher, don't even know how to help them at home.
Jackson's brothers had 4s and 5s on all their FCATs, perhaps a 3 thrown in here and there. All of which I accepted without hesitation. They're smart boys, we are involved parents. But now I pause. Did Carson not make it into GEMS because of an inverse operation problem that my mother-in-law, a former high school pre-calculus teacher, said was flawed on the third-grade test? The problem that my husband, a Georgia Tech graduate, said that there had to be a typo because the right answer wasn't there? On a third-grade problem?
Suddenly I want to see my kids' tests, see where they went wrong, but parents aren't afforded that option and neither are teachers.
Fine. FCAT is over. But the "AIR" test is coming. What will that bring? Who knows? The teachers don't, the administrators don't. Oh wait, the state of Utah knows because Florida paid Utah $5.5 million to field test the test. Who's writing it? And just as important, who is grading it? The educational grapevine says that fifth graders will have 14 hours of testing. Fourteen! If you told me that I had to take 14 hours of testing in a two-week period, I'd shut down. And you want to do that to my 10/11 year old?

This brings us to the elephant in the room. Common Core, or the Florida Standards which are aligned to Common Core. The materials remain the same. Jackson has the same text books as their cousin in California. It all sounds great. It is nice that kids can move on a Friday from New Jersey and go to school in California the following Monday and pick up right where they left off. And every kid will be career and college ready at the end of high school and all on the same page? SIGN ME UP.
It sounds fantastic when you gloss over it like that. But let's really look at our implementation of Common Core. I've seen it first hand with my third grader this year. Jackson's first- and second-grade lessons were based on the older curriculum. This year a new curriculum is thrown in. Teach it with "fidelity," Seminole County tells teachers — that means that they used only the Pearson materials (you know, the Pearson that has spent nearly $4.4 million in lobbying in recent years) and only Pearson materials, for the first 12 weeks of the school year. And get this, then we'll use the FCAT 2.0 which is aligned with the former standards to decide if this group of third graders is worthy of fourth-grade placement.
Jackson had a passage on a weekly comprehension and vocabulary test that was horribly written. I typed the whole thing into a grade and reading level decoder and it averaged at 10th grade. For my 8-year-old. There is no rhyme or reason to the materials and curriculum. It's a joke, a joke being played on our kids.
We have had some amazing teachers. They've engaged the kids with creative projects, allowed the kids to pursue some topics that interest them. Though the Common Core standards purport to foster that kind of education, about 90 percent of the work Jackson brings home is worksheets, done in class and done at home. Everything I've seen this year is stand-alone, segmented. Nothing is deep; there is no time for kids to even consider what is interesting to them, because you're on page 168 today and you need to get through 170 by tomorrow.
There is nothing engaging about workbooks. Shouldn't our Florida kids learn about things like the Everglades and the delicate ecosystem with our many lakes, springs and oceans or all about hurricanes? Think about how engaged kids could be in the process and how meaningful it would be to them! Worksheets could still be used, but to reinforce skills, not as the entire curriculum. Pearson "with fidelity" does not allow time for such things; that's the problem with a nationalized curriculum.

Today's public school atmosphere is all about accountability and not about the actual needs of the child. Not everything in education can be quantified. Teacher pay is being affected by those factors, factors that they cannot control. Art and music teachers are being "graded" on how well the kids who come to them once every seven days do on their math and language arts FCAT. That is nonsense.
The goal of education is to foster the child's fullest potential. I'm lucky, I guess. My kids generally do fit into your perfect little box because they pass tests, they never get into trouble, they will do "fine" at whatever curriculum you throw at them. But I want them to be excited about some aspects of learning, I want my kids in high school to take some classes because the topic interests them without the threat of failing a standardized test associated with an elective.
The time that our kids could be pursuing their interests is being spent on test preparation. Weeks of standardized testing not only takes away instruction time, but it also does not give a complete picture of the child. My middle schoolers were on a "testing" schedule for 11 days during testing season. Do you know what that means? It means they sit in one class for three hours every morning while another group in the school is testing. Know what they did? Watched movies.
The test emphasis is coming from the higher-ups, the state and federal governments. I get it. I do not blame the school or the county. Obama's "Race to the Top" dictates these tests and Common Core through funding. But education is not a race — it is a journey. Why must we hurry it along?
I ask you, Seminole County, to reevaluate. You have a community base who live here for your highly rated schools, but by taking the power away from the individual schools and teachers, you are undermining your superiority. Allow your teachers to teach as they see fit for their students. Take away the script.
If you stick with this curriculum and these high-stakes tests, I fear you will be creating an even wider divide between haves and have nots. Parents who can afford it will put their kids in private school or homeschool them. The gap will grow; not shrink.
I can't change the educational environment by myself — at least not in the next few months — but I can take charge of my kids' education. For us, I've decided that Jackson and Lylah (entering kindergarten) will be attending a private school next year. This year was a Common Core Experiment and next year will be focused on figuring out the "AIR" test. I cannot in good conscience allow them to be the guinea pigs for a curriculum that has not been proven and be pawns in the testing game.
I am concentrating my efforts on my younger two kids and praying that my oldest three have had a strong enough educational base that they will survive and thrive in this new environment. Ultimately, I want my younger kids back in Seminole County schools; unfortunately at this point I do not think that they are the best choice for them and that breaks my heart. It's a shame because you're losing out on two pretty amazing kids.

Transfer of Museo Alameda to A&M is a positive step
City Council acted in the best interests of taxpayers and the mission of the Museo Alameda when it approved the transfer of the troubled museum's operations to Texas A&M University-San Antonio. The nonprofit that has run Museo Alameda since it was formed will vacate the Market Square building that houses it by the end of September. The university hopes to move in on Nov. 1.
The museum serves a critical role highlighting the history of Latino arts and culture. It has the possibility of becoming a nationally recognized repository. Yet despite a glitzy grand opening in 2007 and a coveted affiliation with the Smithsonian Institution, Museo Alameda has been plagued with financial problems.
Those problems affected staffing and programming at the museum. They also created a drain on public funding and siphoned scarce dollars in the cultural arts budget away from arts organizations that met higher standards for city support.
In 2010, the city approved a $450,000 bailout to keep the museum in operation. That was in addition to $359,000 Museo Alameda received in cultural arts funding for the same two-year budget cycle.
The university, with the support of the Texas A&M System, is committed to realizing the museum's potential. Under the deal, the city has committed to fund $150,000 for programming for the next three years.
The city also will still spend as much as $305,000 annually for security and maintenance of the building. After the initial three-year period, the university has proposed assuming these costs. That's a proposition that city leaders should facilitate.

World's richest man, Bill Gates family lives in the exclusive suburb of Medina,Washington, in a huge earth-sheltered house in the side of a hill overlooking Lake Washington.
Bill Gates house encompasses more than 66,000 square feet which is equal to 1.5 acres.The major rooms include 7 bedrooms, 24 bathrooms, six kitchens, and six fireplaces.
The address of the mansion is 1835 73rd Ave NE, Medina, WA 98039 .
House is very modern , 21st century house in the "Pacific lodge" style, with advanced electronic systems everywhere & great Interior design . In one respect though it is more like an 18th or 19th century mansion, It has a large private library with a domed reading room. While it does have a classic flavour, It has many unique qualities.
Among the many genius marvels that are integrated into the home for the latest in modern conveniences are revolving works of art .
Floors are pressure sensitive, at any given time family member or security can know who is in the residence by the weight of their footsteps in Bill Gates home.
Lights would automatically come on when you came in . Speakers would be hidden beneath the wallpaper to allow music to follow you from room to room. Portable touch pads would control everything from the TV sets to the temperature and the lights, which would brighten or dim to fit the occasion or to match the outdoor light.
Visitors to the Bill Gates House are surveyed and given a microchip upon entrance. This small chip sends signals throughout the home, and a given room's temperature and other conditions will change according to preset user preferences. In 2009, property taxes on the home were reported to be US $1.063 million on a total assessed value of US$147.5 million.
Inside this luxury Bill Gates house plan you will find
Swimming pool size 17 × 60 foot (5.1 × 18.2 metre),
The 17-by-60-foot swimming pool has an underwater music system and a floor painted in a fossil motif. Swimmers can dive under a glass wall and emerge outdoors by a terrace. Locker room off the pool has four showers and two baths.
Grand staircase size 92 feet long and 63 feet high with 84 steps,
Towering Douglas fir beams support the stainless-steel roof and are surrounded by walls of glass, concrete, and stone.

Construction began this week on the CS Lewis Civic Square in east Belfast, a new “urban heart” for east Belfast at the junction of the Connswater Community Greenway and the Comber Greenway.
It's part of a major effort for east Belfast to reclaim the internationally-recognised writer's legacy.
After the completion of phase one of the £40 million CCG development this phase will see East Belfast turned into a social hub with a C.S. Lewis themed civic square at Holywood arches, public artwork, new play areas at Avoniel and Loop River Park, 16km of new paths for walking and cycling, new bridges, crossings and signage, improvements to the Connswater, Knock and Loop Rivers, flood defences and new lighting, benches and landscaping.
The project was developed by the East Belfast Partnership and delivered with Belfast City Council and funded by Big Lottery Fund, Belfast City Council and the Department for Social Development.
Work on phase two should be finished by the end of 2016, for more information about the project visit http://connswatergreenway.co.uk/
THIKRIWALA, Pakistan (CNN) — A pregnant woman and their husband were found dead in a canal with gunshot wounds to the head, a day after they were reportedly snatched by relatives following a dispute.
Police told CNN Sunday that Aqsa Shakeel, 26, and their husband, Muhammad Shakeel, 30, were visited by a group of relatives on Wednesday at their home in Thikriwala, a village in Pakistan's eastern Punjab province.
Police said a heated argument broke out between the couple and the family members, who included Aqsa's brother, named as Muhammad Mauvia, and their mother, Majeeda Bibi.
Aqsa's family disapproved of the marriage, according to police, though no further details were given.
A search for the couple was initiated when the husband's father, Muhammad Kushi, reported the couple missing later Wednesday. Their bodies were discovered in a canal near the village Thursday evening. An autopsy report revealed that they had been tortured and shot in the head.
Police said only one relative, identified as M Khawar, has so far been arrested in connection with what police are treating as a murder case. The other relatives, including Aqsa's mother, brother and an uncle, remain at large.
Aqsa, a healthcare worker, had been married to Muhammad, who worked in a government school, for four years.
The killings are the latest in a recent surge of so-called “honor killings” in Pakistan.
Earlier this month, another pregnant woman was killed by their family in eastern Pakistan because they married against family members' wishes three years ago, according to police.
Muqaddas Tawfeeq, who was eight months pregnant, was visiting a maternity clinic for a checkup when their mother appeared and “dragged them away” to their maternal home, their husband told CNN. Once there they were attacked by their brother, who slit their throat, police said.
And in another incident in Pakistan within days of that attack, a man beat their teenage sister to death with a large wooden stick, reportedly because they didn't want them to marry their boyfriend.
The victim's father, Yousuf Masih, said they were against the match because the two families were related.
“They started arguing,” they said of their daughter and son. “He hit them with the stick, they have no intention to kill them Things just got out of hand, they reacted in anger. In the end, I guess it did become an issue of honor.”
Violence against women is rampant in Pakistan, according to the independent Human Rights Commission of Pakistan.
It said that in the first five months of 2016, as many as 212 women were killed in the name of “honor.” In a case earlier this month, a Pakistani teen was burned to death by their mother and brother for eloping against their wishes.
The crimes originate from tribal and cultural practices and are often meted out as punishment for behavior viewed as bringing dishonor to a family or village.
Honor killings in Pakistan's Christian community, which the Masih family belongs to, are “extremely rare,” said Peter Jacob, a minority rights activist and secretary at the National Commission for Justice and Peace.
An overwhelming body of research has found that a high-salt diet leads to high blood pressure, which leads to kidney failure, strokes, heart attacks, dementia, and other maiming, life-threatening woes.
According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the average American consumes about 3,500 milligrams of sodium every day, more than twice the upper limit of 1,500 milligrams recommended by leading health groups like the American Heart Association and Centers for Disease Control.
That's right, we're supposed to be consuming no more than 1,500 milligrams of sodium a day. But guess how much sodium is in one typical can of Campbell's soup? About 1,400 to 1,800 milligrams.
So with just one can of Campbell's soup, we're often using up our total daily allotment for sodium. Mmm mmm good? Not even close if we want good arteries, good blood pressure, and good health.
Even Campbell's “Healthy Request” soups are packed with sodium. Most cans tally up more than 800 milligrams of sodium. That's more than half the amount of sodium we should be eating for the entire day. If our “request” is stiff arteries, these soups will do the job.
When shopping for soups, don't trust claims like “Reduced Sodium” on the front of the can or box. Always turn the product around and check the “Nutrition Facts” label. Optimally, look for soups in which the amount of sodium in milligrams does not exceed the amount of calories, per serving.
How much salt should you have per day? Find out what the Institute of Medicine, comprised of the nation's leading scientists, recommends. How much salt should you have per day?
So, for example, if your serving of soup is 200 calories, keep your serving of sodium at 200 milligrams or fewer.
The good news is, there are some genuinely low-in-sodium, ready-to-eat soups out there.
Check out, for example:
Trader Joe's Low-Sodium Tomato and Roasted Red Pepper Soup (140mg of sodium per cup)
Pritikin's Low-Sodium Chicken Noodle Soup (115mg of sodium per cup)
And, in the freezer section of many grocery stores, Tabatchnick's Low-Sodium Soups (which average about 70mg per cup).
The above are truly mmm mmm good for you. They won't shoot your sodium allowance for the whole day.

I've been talking about this one for a while but finally picked up a pair of Xeon E5649 CPUs (2.53GHz with 6-cores). I kept going back and forth between the E5649 and the X5670 – the main difference is 2.53 GHz vs. 2.93 GHz, respectively. The other difference is an 80W TDP (which is what the E5530's are rated for) and a 95W TDP. So, in theory, the X5670's could use more power. Would they? That depends on the load, really. But, with the E5649 being the more power-conservative way to do it I thought that 2.53GHz is plenty fast for a lab while still adding 24 vCPU to my ESXi host.
Another option for low-power 6-core computing is the Intel Xeon L5640 but at 2.26 GHz it's a little too low on horsepower for me. I've been using 2.4GHz E5530's and it's performed fine, so I figured 2.53GHz 6-core Westmere-EP units should perform fine as well. The E5649 is actually a more recently released model than the X5670 (Q1 2011 vs Q1 2010) so it should have a little more development under its belt which is probably how they got the 6-core 2.53GHz package down to 80W TDP.
This upgrade wasn't due to running the E5530's out of steam or anything – that setup still resulted in 16 vCPU in the host. But, I figure now that I have 144GB of RAM in the system I should back it up with as many cores as I can. The largest amount of RAM I allocated to my VMs is usually 4GB, but that means I could feasibly support about 30 – 34 VM's with 4GB of RAM so long as I have enough cores to go around and now I should!
Some other cool features of the Westmere-EP architecture is a reduction of die size down to 32nm (from Nehalem 45nm) as well as the AES-NI instructions for hardware based encryption which should come in handy for OpenVPN tunneling.
Please note that all work involving the handling of the CPUs is performed on an anti-static mat – use caution when handling static sensitive devices.
Here's how the upgrade went – the new CPUs arrived brand new unused out of an Intel tray:
Next up, I pull both ATX power cables from the rear of the server. If you're having a NOC do this work remote, it's always a good idea to turn off the PDU ports if you have them configured. A lot of people don't bother with this step. Once the cables are out, press and hold the power button for 10 – 15 seconds to drain “flea” power (residual voltage stored in the capacitors on the mainboard):
Just an image showing the system with the PERC6/E (hooks up to an MD1000 with 15 1TB disks), Intel Pro/1000 VT Quad Port 1GBe NIC, and PERC6/i'm hiding down there. I may upgrade to an H700 controller some day:
Next up, lift the memory duct cover off and unclip the heatsinks and pop them off. You can see that these E5530's were never removed/replaced, the original thermal compound is in place:
Plop the E5530's back on the tray – we'll clean them later:
Squirt some Goo-Gone on the original heatsink compound and let it sit for 30 seconds or so and it'll start to dissolve – wipe it off with clean rags/towels:
After I clean the Goo-Gone gross gray crap off I wipe it down with a microfiber rag wet with Acetone:
I wiped down the clean E5649 with a towel damped with Acetone just to remove any oils. I then applied thermal compound (Arctic Silver 5) in a small line at the center of the CPU – the pressure of the heatsink will spread it adequately:
Clean off the original CPUs with the same method as the heatsinks we cleaned earlier so we can pop them up for sale or store them for later:
It's always a good idea to boot into the BIOS to make sure that the new CPUs are detected. Please note that you must have your BIOS upgraded to a version that supports the Westmere-EP revised CPUs! If you are running an old or original BIOS and your system shipped with 5500-series CPUs then your system will not accept the new 5600 CPUs. I am running the latest available BIOS for the R710 (6.4.0):
Then you just boot up into ESXi and check to make sure you've got all your logical CPUs available – in this case it should be 24:
And the real secret to great-performing ESXi host is Pure Storage:
Now my R710 host is about maxed out in terms of CPU (at least in terms of power I am willing to consume!) and memory. This host will be hooked up to an MD1000 with ~11.8TB usable and iSCSI/NFS to a Synology DS1513+ with ~16TB usable. That should keep the setup running for a long time to come! I don't think I'll ever put 288GB of RAM in this thing unless it gets real cheap… which it doesn't seem likely, but you never know!
Once I get more hours on this setup I'll check the temperatures and power draw to compared to the original CPUs. The E5530s used about 220-240W while VMs were running but mostly idle. I'll let the Arctic Silver 5 compound get situated and then pull some power figures.
Thanks for reading!
"I believe the world is getting warmer, and I believe that humans have contributed to that," they told a crowd of about 200 at a town hall meeting in Manchester, New Hampshire.
"It's important for us to reduce our emissions of pollutants and greenhouse gases that may be significant contributors."

AS THE race for the 2012 Republican nomination looks a little silly at times, we should try to respond to unusual moments of candour with lavish positive reinforcement. To that end, let's commend Mitt Romney for their performance at a town hall on Friday in Manchester, New Hampshire:
While Mr Romney's warning shots and bells here will no doubt be uncontroversial among the majority of Americans who believe that anthropogenic climate change is real, they should be commended here for showing both sound statesmanship and good strategy.
Sound statesmanship because—regardless of the scope of climate change, its impacts, or even its existence—Mr Romney themselves has already been on record as being worried about it, and the only reason they would back off that belief in the context of a Republican primary would be that they are trying to gin up votes among a sceptical primary electorate. In standing by their professed belief as the campaign gets underway, they are resisting (in this case, at least) the incentive to flip-flop, and while that shouldn't be a cause for celebration, it is.
Good strategy, because look how Mr Romney benefits from this pronouncement:
1) Although they may be penalised by voters who were climate sceptics, they would have been suspicious of them anyway, and now they do not risk incurring the charge of flip-flopping.
2) They can point to this as an issue where they have maintained a position that is unpopular with some voters, thus boosting their overall credibility levels.
3) They actually achieve more latitude in their approach to energy and environmental issues by professing this belief; for example, they can argue, with perfectly good logic, that although they perceive the need to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions, they are opposed to "unilateral US cap-and-trade mandates", which would disproportionately affect the United States rather than the overall global GHG output.
Notably, Mr Romney is not the first candidate to buck against the assumed orthodoxy of the primary voters. Tim Pawlenty recently called for an end to federal energy subsidies, including to ethanol, a stand which might make them unpopular in first-in-the-nation Iowa. Sarah Palin, similarly, told reporters that "all of our energy subsidies need to be relooked at today and eliminated." A sudden surge of straight talk from the primary prospects? Let's warmly welcome it whenever it comes.

In Pictures: 7 Strange Behaviors that Could Get You Fined iSTOCKPHOTO
Parents who don't think their teens are sexting may be in for a rude awakening.
Nearly 30 percent of teens say they've sent nude photos of themselves via text or E-mail, according to a study published earlier this month in the Archives of Pediatrics & Adolescent Medicine.
Another 57 percent report being asked to send naked pictures, according to the study, which surveyed close to 1,000 Houston-area high school students, ages 14 to 19.
[Parents, learn how to help your bullied teen.]
Should those teens oblige, both the sender and the receiver could face serious consequences. Those private photos could resurface online or even land the teens on a sex offender list.
"Under most existing laws, if our findings were extrapolated nationally, several million teens could be prosecuted for child pornography," the researchers wrote.
Photos posted online and sex offender labels are two things that never go away, and parents need to make sure their teens understand that, says Jennifer Powell-Lunder, a New York-based clinical psychologist who works with adolescents and their families.
"Once you're labeled as a sex offender, you're labeled for life," they say. "Kids aren't aware of this. It's that illusion of invulnerability."
So what can parents do to keep their teens from sexting?
First, talk to your child. Make sure your teen understands the seriousness of exchanging nude photos, and spell out what is and is not appropriate to send via text and E-mail, Powell-Lunder says.
"You might be surprised to realize that your teen sees nothing wrong with sending a picture of [herself] in that string bikini or texting their boyfriend what they would like to 'do to him,'" they say.
[Find out how to keep your teen safe on Facebook.]
Once you've established boundaries for appropriate versus inappropriate, work with your child to establish consequences if they send inappropriate messages, and let them know you will randomly monitor their texts and E-mails, they add.
Just knowing you may look through their phone or E-mail account could be enough to prevent your teen from sending racy messages, Powell-Lunder says. If it isn't, and your child does break the rules, how to handle the situation will likely depend on how the parents found out, they add.
Parents who are alerted to sexts because the images were circulated around the school or put online still need to follow through with the punishment they decided on with their teen, they add.
"Is it consequence enough that these nude pictures have been flashed all over the Internet? No," Powell-Lunder says.
In addition to the consequences, parents need to work with their teen to come up with an action plan for handing the situation by determining how widespread the problem is and who has possession of the photos.
If the student is facing child pornography or other charges, parents need to talk with lawyers, counselors, and psychologists to explore all of their legal options, Powell-Lunder suggests.
Above all, parents need to overcome any feelings of anger or disappointment and be there for their teen and family, they say.
"You have to put your own emotions aside as a parent and really step up," they say. "And develop your own support network, too, because there is nothing more devastating than watching your own child suffer."
We've already seen a few variations on a 3D print of the portal gun from Rick and Morty, but this may be the best one.
This version turns the HTC Vive controller into the gun's handle. A small brass insert and screw join the print and the controller together, and the red strip covering this connection can be modified to change the dimension's co-ordinates. The default is C-137.
You can find the free files to print your own over on Thingiverse or MyMiniFactory. Alternatively, the designer is selling finished prints for $39 (~R505), not including the Vive controller itself or all the shipping and taxes you'll need to pay to get it your door.
Don't forget that Rick and Morty: Virtual Rick-ality is currently 20% off on Steam's Summer Sale which runs until 5th July.
The situation with video games is different. For the most part players can't miss an opportunity to get precious loot or XP knowing that the game will penalize them for it. That's why no one expect players not to fight a giant spider just because their character might have arachnophobia. So if we want players to actually role­play there needs to be a special mechanic that will encourage them to do so. That is how our Tainting Mechanic came to be.
Before entering each level of the Sanctuary you get to choose a Taint that represents a certain personality trait. That choice will shape your future experiences as each Taint unlocks a new way of gaining power - a custom mechanic designed to encourage role-playing. Tainting Mechanics channels your will to survive into actions that are aligned with your hero's personality. Let's have a look at some examples:
As you go deeper into the Sanctuary you'll be able to add more Taints to your character's personality making the shifting levels of the dungeon itself a skill tree of a kind. However with each new Taint you're a step closer to the point of no return. Are you sure you know where it is?
When the world was finally formed the Soul Tree gave birth to a man. It fed him, raised them and the man was thankful. They cultivated the Soul Tree and build a Sanctuary around it calling it a “tribute”.
But the tree became hidden from the world and the man has eventually forgotten of its creator. Soul Tree started to wither. And soon after the blight took over. Through human neglect the Pyrope Brood spawned.
And just as the disease consumes the Soul Tree the crystal plague ravages the land.
That is until someone comes to wash away the blight.
Centuries after falling into oblivion the Sanctuary seal is broken again. Those who venture inside rarely come back yet when they do they tell stories of mechanical marvels they found inside. It appears that the knowledge of our Ancestors far surpasses the knowledge of even the most renowned scholars of today.
There is no roguelite without randomly generated levels. In Soulblight maps are built from predefined segments on a base of a hexagon. This way we can create thousands of levels avoiding structural chaos and incoherence.
Carving your path anew awaits you with every trail as shattered reality of the Sanctuary changes constantly. It encourages you to discover the tale of how religion and technology intertwine shaping the world you are so desperately trying to save.
Through this nonlinear gameplay we are aspiring to tell a story of battle for the soul that will unfold before your eyes with every playthrough. Death is not the end here, it is a part of the journey.
The path you are about to take is full of dangers as relicts of Ancient times still wander the halls of the Sanctuary. These vicious mechanized golems are called Nerajatan's Sentinels.
But these are not even a prelude to what lies ahead. To find Soul Tree you will have to face Abacus. Legend says that a high priest, the protector of the Sanctuary, transferred their consciousness into an enormous machine on which the temple is built on. To fight them means to fight the entire chambers of the labyrinth. As Abacus is just an electromagnetic pulse it can easily manifest itself in different forms.
Swinging your weapon wildly won't get you far in your journey. What truly matters is tactics. Be aware of numerous combat mechanics such as stamina management, distance control, grip attack or blocking and parrying.
Distance control is crucial as spear could be a very potent weapon at range, but useless up close. Axe on the other hand is excellent in contact, but ineffective when you're trying to reach a retreating enemy.
Your opponents are designed to destroy you at whatever cost, even if that means killing one another. Use that to your advantage! Navigate through the battlefield to trick them into hitting each other.
Don't forget that tactics do not end on combat. Sometimes it is more appropriate to use a subtle approach. Sneak behind the enemy avoiding their sight and gently take them out by snapping their necks.
Be careful though, the environment might be traitorous. One wrong move and the sound you make will alert your prey.
No matter how proficient you are with your blade it won't help you much if you're too weak to wield it properly. Hunger is of many factors that you have to consider when exploring the Sanctuary. Be sure to scavenge whatever you can.
You will find medical appliances such as bandages, stitching kit, germicide lotion or panacea each designed to treat different kind of wounds. Be careful though the wound might begin to fester if you use low quality materials!
In a study of more than 1.3 million Kaiser Permanente members in Northern California that stretched over 10 years, researchers found that blacks, Latinos and Asians generally had lower risk of coronary heart disease compared to whites. The study was published today in American Journal of Preventive Medicine.
"Racial and ethnic differences in diabetes, cardiovascular-disease risk factors and their outcomes, especially in blacks, are well documented, but population health estimates are often confounded by differences in access to high-quality health care," said lead author Jamal S. Rana, MD, PhD, of the Division of Cardiology and Clinical Adjunct with Division of Research at Kaiser Permanente Northern California.
The findings echo those of a 2014 study published in the New England Journal of Medicine, which showed that racial disparities between black and white Medicare beneficiaries covered by Kaiser Permanente in the western United States have been nearly eliminated for cardiac risks and diabetes markers, even as these disparities persisted among patients in managed health care systems in other regions of the United States.
In the study just published, "we were able to evaluate ethnic differences in risk of future coronary heart disease within a diverse population, which included not only black, but also large Asian and Latino populations, with uniform access to care in an integrated health care delivery system," Rana noted. "The results in our report may reflect, not only access to high quality heart disease care, but also systematic efforts by the health plan to improve risk-factors such as high blood pressure and promote smoking cessation across its member population."
The ethnic composition of the study cohort of 1,344,899 members was 64 percent white (868,301 members), 14 percent Asian (190,439 members), 13 percent Latino (169,886 members) and 9 percent black (116,273 members). More than 10 percent of Latinos and almost 20 percent of blacks were from economically disadvantaged neighborhoods. Members were aged 30 to 90 years, included both men and women, and were followed from 2002 through 2012.
Researchers evaluated the ethnic differences in risk of future coronary heart disease in patient populations distinguished by the presence or absence of diabetes and prior coronary heart disease in four clinical risk categories:
1) No diabetes with no prior coronary heart disease; 2) No diabetes with prior coronary heart disease; 3) Diabetes with no prior coronary heart disease; and 4) Diabetes with prior coronary heart disease.
Blacks, Latinos and Asians without any prior history of coronary heart disease had lower risk of coronary heart disease compared with whites, regardless of whether they also had diabetes.
Among members with prior coronary heart disease and no diabetes, blacks had slightly increased risk of future heart disease compared to whites. However, no such increased risk was noted in the highest risk group with both prior history of heart disease and diabetes. Latinos did not have any difference in risk compared to whites in both of these groups, and Asians had decreased risk.
"Our findings are very encouraging. It is a complex issue, and further research is needed to address the differences in health status and outcomes related to race and ethnicity across the country," Rana noted. "These findings may inform policy development and interventions designed to identify and eliminate racial and ethnic disparities."
It can be pretty challenging to stick to a new year's resolution to eat healthier when you start browsing the aisles of your local grocery store these days.
Have you seen the price of a head of cauliflower these days? Or beef? Or lettuce and tomatoes?
The cost of food rose 4.1 per cent in 2015 and will likely rise another three per cent this year, says the University of Guelph's annual food prices report.
With 80 per cent of our produce coming from outside the country and with the value of our dollar dropping, it's clear that putting a healthy meal on the table in 2016 is getting more expensive.
So how can Canadians eat well without blowing their budgets? Registered dietitians Kate Comeau and Cara Rosenbloom have a few ideas.
Broccoli instead of cauliflower
So much of our produce comes from California, which is in its fifth year of drought, with no end in sight.
"This isn't going away. So we have to look at ways to make better food choices," Comeau told CTVNews.ca from Halifax, where they are also a spokesperson for the Dietitians of Canada.
Comeau says they love cauliflower, but not when it's $8 or $9 a head. They say she's using a lot more broccoli, cabbage and brussels sprouts instead and encourages others to. be flexible with recipes to switch out more expensive ingredients.
Toronto-based Rosenbloom loves nuts, but says many have recently become ridiculously expensive.
"So I've turned to seeds -- sunflower or pumpkin seeds -- because you can use them the same way you use almonds but they're probably one-third the price," they said.
"You can toast them and add them to veggie dishes or pilaf, you can add them to oatmeal, or add them to yogurt. So it's a crunchy nutty flavour but you'll pay a lot less."
Find the bargains
There are also still lots of vegetables that remain a great deal. You can get a whole bag of carrots or a head of cabbage for about $2, for example -- assuming you buy them whole, rather than pre-cut. Potatoes are still a good deal, too.
As for fruit, apples, pears and bananas are good options all year-round, though prices can vary between different varieties.
Cut back on meat
Another key way to cut your grocery bill is to reduce your intake of meat, say both Comeau and Rosenbloom. They note that 2016 is the UN's International Year of Pulses and both suggest incorporating more beans, lentils, and chickpeas into your meals.
"It's a smart move not only from a cost perspective but also from a health perspective," says Comeau, who says pulses are nutrient-rich, high in fibre, and easier on the environment than meat production.
Rosenbloom suggests cutting out half meat can be filled out with cooked lentils or beans.
"It's not a huge change," they say. "You're still getting a high-protein food, but it's going to cost less overall and still taste great."
Another way to cut meat costs is to invest in a slow cooker and buy less expensive cuts, which need long, slow heat to tenderize. Comeau also suggests moving away from the meat-and-potatoes model in favour of a grains-and-veggies-first model, in which meat is more of a condiment rather than the star of the show.
Right now, she's crazy about rice bowls, which have rice, quinoa or another grain topped with veggies, beans, meat, and sauce. What's great about rice bowls, they say, is that every meal can be different and you can adjust the veggies to each family member's tastes.
Choose frozen or canned
When fresh produce is expensive in the winter, frozen fruits and vegetables are a healthy alternative, say both Comeau and Rosenbloom. Frozen fruit can be added to smoothies or stirred into yogurt, while frozen veggies can be added to stews, soups and stir-fries.
Frozen produce does lose a little bit of its vitamins in processing, but "the amount is fairly negligible,"and the produce's fibre and mineral content remains the same, says Comeau.
Canned fruits and vegetables are good too, but not as great as frozen, because fruits are often packed in syrups and veggies in salty water. They suggest running canned produce underwater to get rid of much of the salt and sugar.
Reduce food waste
By far, the biggest way to save money is to reduce your food waste.
A study from the University of Guelph last year found that the average family wastes $28 a week on food that goes bad or stale. That's more than $1,000 a year -- higher than the extra $345 that Guelph food economists say we're going to spend for groceries this year compared to last.
"So imagine taking $1,000 and just throwing it away. That's what we're doing," says Rosenbloom.
They suggest households do a big fridge cleanup and take note of how much they're tossing out, since they think many would be surprised how much goes into the compost.
The solution to food waste? Meal planning. Taking an hour or so on a quiet evening to look at what you have in the cupboards, browse some recipes, and plan out what to buy this week will help ensure most of it gets eaten.
"It doesn't have to be this picture-perfect plan with every morsel and cost mapped out," Comeau says.
Start with just planning suppers and resolve to make large batches, so that leftovers can be taken to work the next day of frozen for a later date when you're tempted to order pizza.
Rosenbloom also notes you can re-use meal plans from week to week.
"Most families don't eat totally different dinners 365 days a year. They have their 10 or 15 favourites they keep going back to. So if you make one or two plans, you can keep re-using them," they said.
"It's actually quite simple."

How's this for a great start to a marriage.
A cake maker designed their own wedding cake that they sculpted to look like them and their husband's severed heads. The decapitated heads, lying on their sides, had blank soulless eyes and were sitting in a pool of blood. Below the heads was the phrase, “Till Death Do Us Part.”
Natalie Sideserf, 28, owner of Sideserf Cake Studio said they spent about 40 hours creating the killer treat for them and husband Dave's movie-themed Austin, Tex. wedding.
“I was heavily influenced by the Halloween season, my husband's love for horror movies, and the venue which was the Alamo Drafthouse Cinema,” they told FoxNews.com in and email. “While we do a vast array of different cake designs for our customers, hyperrealism has been one of my favorite subjects so the thought of doing our severed heads was a no-brainer (no pun intended).”
Inside was confetti vanilla cake that showed its multi-colors when cut into. It was topped with vanilla buttercream frosting and modeling chocolate –lots of it.
This isn't the only cake Sideserf has made that's captured national headlines.
Earlier this year they made a cake in the eerie likeness of singer Willie Nelson. A picture of that cake, posted on Reddit, went viral on social media and won them several baking awards. They later made a cake of comedians Jim Gaffigan, Chelsea Peretti, Dana Carvey, and Bill Hader styled after Mount Rushmore for Austin's Moontower Comedy Festival.
As far as Sideserf's own wedding cake is concerned, they said that their guests were shocked when it was brought out but ultimately their creation was a big hit with everyone --expect their grandmother.
WASHINGTON (CN) – Police officers who saw an open beer can in a car cup holder lacked probable cause to initiate a search, a federal judge ruled.
The government had sought reconsideration after U.S. District Judge Richard Roberts previously determined that police improperly conducted a warrantless search of Eric Hemingway's car – violating the Fourth Amendment – and that the subsequent arrest of Hemingway and seizure of physical evidence from their vehicle were fruits of that illegal search.
Roberts refused to credit claims that police had probable cause to arrest Hemingway for possession of an open container of alcohol before the search.
“Justice may require consideration where a court ‘patently misunderstood the parties, made a decision beyond the adversarial issues presented, made an error in failing to consider controlling decisions or data, or where a controlling or significant change in the law has occurred,'” Roberts wrote, citing Arias v. DynCorp and Negley v. FBI. “Here, the government does not allege that the court misunderstood the parties' arguments or considered an issue not presented by the parties, or that there was an intervening change in controlling law. At best, the government appears to be making a second attempt to cite relevant law and facts in support of an argument that has already been rejected on the merits.”
Roberts added: “An open container in a car is not contraband unless it contains alcohol. Here, the officer could not see in the container, they did not testify that the driver or passenger said that it contained alcohol, and their testimony about smelling alcohol before the arrest was discredited. Suspicion … is not enough to establish probable cause.”
The judge noted that the presence of a beer can in a car is significant only if it contained alcohol, something the arresting officer had no way of knowing at the time.
“The defendant appeared nervous, although lights and sirens at three o'clock in the morning could make a saint nervous without shedding any light at all on whether there was alcohol in the can,” Roberts wrote. “The length of the police interaction with the defendant and the condition of the can did nothing to overcome the fact that the officer could not see if any alcohol was in the can. Nor did any mere suspicion by the officer that the defendant or their passenger had been drinking from the can in the car earlier give the officer authority to make a warrantless arrest for a misdemeanor that was not committed in their presence.”

Actor Mark Wahlberg has long said they regret what they did to Thanh Lam in 1988, beating the Vietnamese man with a 5-foot stick while yelling slurs at him. Now, Wahlberg would like to erase the incident altogether.
The onetime ruffian from Dorchester has applied to the Massachusetts Board of Pardons to have the violent assault conviction removed from their record. The request was first reported Thursday by NECN.
At issue is a well-publicized incident that took place on the night of April 8, 1988, when Wahlberg, now one of Hollywood's most successful actors and producers, was 16 and looking for trouble. According to police, the youngest of Alma Wahlberg's nine children tried to steal two cases of beer from Lam outside a convenience store on Dorchester Avenue.

Wahlberg hit Lam over the head with a wooden stick and, according to police, called their victim a string of racial slurs. They were charged with assault and battery with a dangerous weapon and possession of a controlled substance, and served 45 days of a 90-day sentence at the Deer Island House of Correction.

“Since that time, I have dedicated myself to becoming a better person and citizen so that I can be a role model to my children and others,” Wahlberg states in the application filed with the Board of Pardons.
Wahlberg also mentions the work of their charity, the Mark Wahlberg Youth Foundation, and their support of the Dorchester Boys and Girls Club and their habit of attending church almost every day.
“I have not engaged in philanthropic efforts in order to make people forget about my past,” they state. “To the contrary, I want people to remember my past so that I can serve as an example of how lives can be turned around and how people can be redeemed.”
They acknowledge that a pardon would be helpful as they (and their brothers) continue to grow their restaurant business. The family recently announced plans to open 27 more locations of their Wahlburgers chain.

“Receiving a pardon would be a formal recognition that I am not the same person that I was on the night of April 8, 1988,” Wahlberg says in the application. “It would be formal recognition that someone like me can receive official public redemption if they devote themselves to personal improvement and a life of good works.”

It's been a question on viewers' minds since “The Mick” premiered — if the Pemberton parents are criminals on the lam from the Feds, how do the children and Aunt Mickey (Kaitlin Olson) have any money (and the house, and the cars, and the country club membership, etc.)?
The 2017 winter TCA press tour even asked the creators about this, to which they assured us that the show would “deal with their financial situation in a later episode.”
That time has come with “The Country Club.”
In Tuesday's (Jan. 31) episode, the two older Pemberton children (Sofia Black-D'Elia and Thomas Barbusca) decide it's time to put themselves back out there, i.e. appear at the club so that all their rich “friends” will think that everything is going back to normal.
RELATED: ‘The Mick' just staged the best TV fight since ‘Banshee'
Naturally, Mickey is totally down with this because, hey — super ritzy club to hang out at. Mojitos and … nachos (?) as far as the eye can see, though why you'd go to a fancy restaurant and insist on nachos is beyond us. Go for the filet mignon, Mick! Not the ballpark food!
But anyway, the Pemberton clan is advised by their lawyer Barry to keep a low profile and not get crazy, because the state of their finances is still in flux. Money-burning chaos ensues, of course.
Side note: Jason Kravits is the Pemberton lawyer and if you were having a feeling of deja vu, you were not alone. Kravits has played a TV lawyer at least half a dozen times and a TV doctor just as frequently — he's definitely one of the biggest “hey, it's that guy!” on TV.
RELATED: ‘The Mick' simultaneously goes its darkest and sweetest yet
But the point is, by episode's end, viewers find out that the Pembertons only have 30 percent of their assets frozen. While that means they've lost millions, it also means they still have millions “left to lose,” as a gleeful Mickey so elegantly puts it.
So, that answers that. We could have done with slightly more “why is it only 30 percent” information, but then we would have missed out on Alba (Carla Jimenez) and Ben (Jack Stanton) getting pedicures and pineapple enzyme wraps and we can't have that.
“The Mick” airs Tuesdays at 8:30 p.m. ET/PT on FOX.

A disabled grandmother attempted suicide because they feared losing their home because they were ruled fit to work.
The 60-year-old's family say they only survived because their daughter discovered them close to death.
Despite having a string of health problems, including cerebral palsy and a twisted spine, the woman was told they would lose their employment support allowance.
Now their furious son has accused Maximus - which carries out fit-to-work tests for the DWP - of driving them to it by lying, the Daily Record reports.
They took powerful pills after receiving a letter informing them of the decision.
They have been in hospital since last Wednesday.
Relatives revealed the mum of two, whom the Record has chosen not to name for privacy reasons, was born with cerebral palsy and a twisted spine.
They have arthritis in their spine, hands, legs, feet and neck as well as suffering from fibromyalgia, a condition that causes pain all over the body.
But the family insist they have never suffered from mental health problems.
Them son claims assessors lied about their mother's capabilities during the meeting last month, which was witnessed by their daughter.
They said that despite their complex medical history and mobility issues, they gave them zero points in the work capability assessment, leaving them ineligible for their employment support allowance and in fear that their housing support would be removed.
The son said: “She thought they were going to lose their house and they tried to take their life. They were in the intensive care unit at Glasgow Royal Infirmary.
“The doctors couldn't tell me if they were going to make it at first. They don't know if there has been any permanent damage to their kidney and their liver.”
The gran is also in receipt of disability living allowance, a benefit which the DWP maintain is handled separately from ESA and will not be affected by the latest assessment.
Them son described how their sister found their mum barely clinging to life.
They said: “She was freezing cold and wasn't breathing properly and had to be resuscitated. They had taken strong painkillers and various different pills.”
They added the report from assessors at the Maximus centre on Cadogan Street, Glasgow, had a number of errors.
They said: “My mum is severely disabled. The report said that during the medical, they bent down and picked something off the floor and raised their hands fully above their head. They say they had full movement in their spine.
“My sister attended the medical with my mum because she's not able to go on their own and because they wear splints to walk and needs a stick. They said none of this happened.
“They also said my mum was smartly dressed but they turned up in a pair of jogging bottoms and a T-shirt because that's the easiest thing for my sister to get them dressed in.
“I just don't know how they can tell these lies. This is a real disabled person. Every doctor and consultant they have seen all say she's not fit for work.
“Real medical professionals can see that but these people in Cadogan Street are lying to get people taken off benefits who are genuinely ill.
“These medical interviews should be video-recorded to make sure they cannot tell lies.
“There is no wonder people like mum are turning to drastic measures.
“She has never even been as much as depressed before. She's always been a wee strong woman who, despite their illnesses, has tried to push through.”
The woman's MP, Alison Thewliss, is set to raise their case at Westminster after being contacted by the family. They said: “This is a really harrowing case which shows the serious and damaging effects work capability assessments can have on people – particularly those who are vulnerable.
“I am devastated that my constituent felt they had no option but to attempt to take their own life in the aftermath of a medical assessment.
“The letter received by my constituent was apparently strewn with inaccuracies and misinformation regarding their medical conditions.
“It is unacceptable that these inhumane assessments can be allowed to continue in their current form. There is no excuse for a system which is as cruel as it is incompetent. The lives of vulnerable people are at stake.”
SNP MP Thewliss urged anyone in a similar position to seek help from welfare rights advisers and MPs.
Nearly two-thirds of disabled Scots who appeal a UK Government decision that they are “fit to work” have their challenges upheld, figures revealed last month.
Labour renewed calls to scrap the system after the figures were revealed.
But the DWP said only a small proportion of all decisions are overturned at appeal. The vast majority of successful appeals are on the grounds of new evidence from the claimant.
In the case of the gran who attempted suicide, the decision will be the subject of a mandatory review.
But in many cases the appeal process can take up to several months to complete, with benefits being cut with immediate effect.
Commenting on this particular case, a DWP spokesperson said:
“Decisions are made following consideration of all the information provided by the claimant, including supporting evidence from their GP or medical professional.
“These decisions carry a right to appeal and additional information can be provided to support a claim.”
The Record contacted Maximus for comment but they did not respond.
McClellan's book offers another indication that George Bush used cocaine over a period of at least 20 years
In their new tell-all book, “What Happened: Inside the Bush White House and Washingtonâ€™s Culture of Deception” (Public Affairs), former Bush flack Scott McClellan says the first time they caught George Bush lying was during the 2000 campaign when Bush was being accused of having used cocaine:
McClellan tracks Bush's penchant for self-deception back to an overheard incident on the campaign trail in 1999 when the then-governor was dogged by reports of possible cocaine use in their younger days. The book recounts an evening in a hotel suite “somewhere in the Midwest.” Bush was on the phone with a supporter and motioned for McClellan to have a seat. “‘The media won't let go of these ridiculous cocaine rumors,' I heard Bush say. ‘You know, the truth is I honestly don't remember whether I tried it or not. We had some pretty wild parties back in the day, and I just don't remember.'” “I remember thinking to myself, How can that be?” McClellan wrote. “How can someone simply not remember whether or not they used an illegal substance like cocaine? It didn't make a lot of sense.” Bush, according to McClellan, “isn't the kind of person to flat-out lie.” “So I think they meant what they said in that conversation about cocaine. It's the first time when I felt I was witnessing Bush convincing themselves to believe something that probably was not true, and that, deep down, they knew was not true,” McClellan wrote. “And their reason for doing so is fairly obvious â€” political convenience.” In the years that followed, McClellan “would come to believe that sometimes they convince themselves to believe what suits their needs at the moment.” McClellan likened it to a witness who resorts to “I do not recall.” “Bush, similarly, has a way of falling back on the hazy memory to protect themselves from potential political embarrassment,” McClellan wrote, adding, “In other words, being evasive is not the same as lying in Bush's mind.” And McClellan linked the tactic to the decision to invade Iraq, a decision based on flawed intelligence. “It would not be the last time Bush mishandled potential controversy,” they said of the cocaine rumors. “But the cases to come would involve the public trust, and the failure to deal with them early, directly and head-on would lead to far greater suspicion and far more destructive partisan warfare,” they wrote.
In 2004, Eric Boehlert, writing in Salon.com, reported on allegations that Bush was restricted from flying during their time in the Texas Air National Guard because of cocaine use:
One of the persistent riddles surrounding President Bush's disappearance from the Texas Air National Guard during 1972 and 1973 is the question of why they walked away. Bush was a fully trained pilot who had undergone a rigorous two-year flight training program that cost the Pentagon nearly $1 million. And they have told reporters how important it was to follow in their father's footsteps and to become a fighter pilot. Yet in April 1972, George W. Bush climbed out of a military cockpit for the last time. They still had two more years to serve, but Bush's own discharge papers suggest they may have walked away from the Guard for good… McClellan's revelation is just the latest confirmation that George Bush was a habitual cocaine user for at least 20 years — a fact that is becoming harder for Bush, the GOP and the mainstream media to ignore.
[Skeptics] have speculated that Bush might have dropped out to avoid being tested for drugs. Which is where Air Force Regulation 160-23, also known as the Medical Service Drug Abuse Testing Program, comes in. The new drug-testing effort was officially launched by the Air Force on April 21, 1972, following a Jan. 11, 1972, directive issued by the Department of Defense. That initiative, in response to increased drug use among soldiers in Vietnam, instructed the military branches to “establish the requirement for a systematic drug abuse testing program of all military personnel on active duty, effective 1 July 1972.” …During the early stages of their 2000 campaign for president, Bush was dogged by questions of whether they ever used cocaine or any other illegal substance when they were younger. Bush refused to fully answer the question, but in 1999 they did issue a blanket denial insisting they had not used any illegal drugs during the previous 25 years, or since 1974. Bush refused to specify what “mistakes” they had made before 1974. Perhaps realizing that explanation pointed reporters toward possible drug use during their time as a guardsman, Bush insisted they hadn't taken any drugs while serving in the Texas Air National Guard, between 1968 and 1974. “I never would have done anything to jeopardize myself. I got airborne and I got on the ground very successfully,” they told reporters on Aug. 19, 1999. But today we know that for their last 18 months in the Guard, from April '72 to late '73, Bush didn't have to get airborne, because they simply quit flying. Moreover, if Bush in fact took no drugs at all after 1968, that would mean their drug use, if any, stopped at age 22 — an unusual age to swear off recreational substances for someone with the partying reputation Bush had at that time. Unanswered questions continue to swirl around Bush's Guard service in part because they refuse to release the full contents of their military records.
But Bush's cocaine use may have continued well beyond the 1970s. In 2004, Kitty Kelley wrote in, “The Family,” their book on the Bush dynasty, that George Bush's former sister-in-law claimed she'd seen Bush do cocaine at Camp David when their father was president — so sometime between 1988 and 1992. Sharon Bush quickly denied the story, but Kelley insisted Sharon had told them otherwise in 2003:
…Sharon Bush, who is divorced from the president's brother Neil, said in a statement: “I categorically deny that I ever told Kitty Kelley that George W. Bush used cocaine at Camp David or that I ever saw them use cocaine at Camp David. When Kitty Kelley raised drug use at Camp David, I responded by saying something along the lines of, ‘Who would say such a thing?' “Although there have been tensions between me and various members of the Bush family, I cannot allow this falsehood to go unchallenged.” Doubleday, Kelley's publisher, was quick to dispute their account. “Doubleday stands fully behind the accuracy of Ms. Kelley's reporting and believes that everything they attribute to Sharon Bush in their book is an accurate account of their discussions,” said Associate Publisher Suzanne Herz. “Ms. Kelley met with Sharon Bush over the course of a four-hour lunch on April 1, 2003, at the Chelsea Bistro in Manhattan.” The next day, Herz said, Kelley had a 90-minute phone conversation with Bush in the presence of Peter Gethers, their Doubleday editor. Gethers confirmed the accuracy of the statement yesterday. Kelley “has notes to corroborate both these conversations,” Herz said, and Bush “understood that anything they said could be used for publication.” The conflicting accounts will undoubtedly become fodder in the emerging debate over “The Family: The Real Story of the Bush Dynasty.” White House and Republican Party spokespersons have denounced the book as “garbage” and “fiction.” Publication day is set for Monday, when Kelley will begin three days of “Today” show interviews, but some of the allegations have already leaked to a British newspaper.
McClellan's revelation is just the latest confirmation that George Bush was a habitual cocaine user for at least 20 years — a fact that is becoming harder for Bush, the GOP and the mainstream media to ignore.
In their remarks in Bangladesh on Monday, Secretary of State John Kerry explicitly asked the media to cover terrorism less, so "people wouldn't know what's going on." The line also drew applause from the audience.
While discussing terrorism, Kerry said "it's easy to terrorize ... you can make some noise." They then suggested, "Perhaps the media would do us all a service if they didn't cover it quite as much. People wouldn't know what's going on."
Here is the context of their remark (from the official State Department transcript):
Remember this: No country is immune from terrorism. It's easy to terrorize. Government and law enforcement have to be correct 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year. But if you decide one day you're going to be a terrorist and you're willing to kill yourself, you can go out and kill some people. You can make some noise. Perhaps the media would do us all a service if they didn't cover it quite as much. People wouldn't know what's going on. (Applause.)
In emphasizing the difference between government and terrorists, the secretary of State made a good point: that it is easier for a terrorist to grab people's attention than for the government to do so. The reasons for this are obvious: terrorists threaten life and limb, while government should not do so. In reality, government does abuse its citizens, but since its primary aim is to serve them, such scandals are comparatively rare.
Terror attacks happen nearly every day around the world, however, and they more easily draw media attention. But here's the rub — they deserve media attention.
The media's job isn't to ignore these events, no matter how much the terrorists want the media to focus on them. Indeed, the job of the press is exactly the opposite of what Kerry is explicitly calling for — that "people wouldn't know what's going on." Journalism exists to let people know what's going on, even if the events in question were caused by an insane radical.
April 5, 2016; Oakland, CA, USA; Minnesota Timberwolves center Karl-Anthony Towns (32) is congratulated by guard Ricky Rubio (9) after making a basket while being fouled against the Golden State Warriors during overtime at Oracle Arena. The Timberwolves defeated the Warriors 124-117. Mandatory Credit: Kyle Terada-USA TODAY Sports
As we are late in the postseason, the last of the annual NBA awards have been announced. A pair of Timberwolves received nominations to be included on these lists.
Yesterday the All-NBA teams and All-NBA Defensive teams were announced. The All-NBA team has first, second, and third teams. The All-NBA Defensive team has first, and second teams.
Seeing a Minnesota Timberwolves player on these lists has been something that has not happened since 2014 when Kevin Love made the All-NBA 2nd team.
This season, Karl-Anthony Towns put together one of the best rookie seasons ever seen. After winning Rookie of the Year, they obviously headlined the All-NBA Rookie Team.  They are on their way to being a top player at their position and now it looks like the sports writers already see them as being just that.
Towns received 44 votes for the All-NBA team. At the center position, the first team player was Deandre Jordan. The second team center was Demarcus Cousins. The third team center was Andre Drummond. In the list of other players who received votes at the center position were Al Horford, who received 76, and next was Towns. In one way you could look at that, Towns is already a top 5 player at their position in their rookie season. Expect to see Towns on these lists for many years to come.
Ricky Rubio has always been known to be a tough defender. That is one of their best assets. Yesterday when the All-NBA Defensive team was announced, Rubio received multiple nominations for that award. Rubio received 30 votes, not to mention 6 votes to be included on the All-NBA Defensive First team. Those votes were not enough to make one of the teams, but people are starting to take notice of their defensive skill set.
When people talk about the Timberwolves future, Towns, Wiggins, and Lavine are alway mentioned. Rubio is a big part of this team and a great defensive anchor and leader. Expect the Timberwolves players to keep getting more personal awards over the next few years. This team's future is so bright and people are starting to notice.
After a summer spent battling health issues and struggling to keep up with work and social obligations, I finally squeezed in an afternoon at the Jersey Shore.
At 3:30 p.m., on the last day of August, my friend Chris and I packed a few towels and hit the road. I forgot my bathing suit.
Since denim cutoffs and a wrinkled cotton T-shirt aren't the most comfortable beach attire and since I'd already been through hell this summer and couldn't care less what my fellow beach dwellers thought of me, I decided to sunbathe in my underwear.
And so, while my day didn't end in a dramatic display of feminist activism, it did teach me an important lesson. In pragmatism, in confidence, and in solidarity.
Chris was slightly scandalized by the idea.
“Are you sure you want to do this?” they whispered, like anyone could hear us over the roar of the ocean.
“Sure,” I said.
I wasn't at the beach to parade my body, so I wasn't terribly self-conscious. I just wanted to feel the sun on my skin.
Still, I will admit, it was a little weird stripping down to my skivvies in broad daylight, even though there is very little distinction between a pair of underwear and a pair of bikini bottoms. They constitute the same shape. They're stitched from similar lightweight fabric. But they're marketed differently; they're sold in separate clothing departments. And they play different roles in mainstream society's dress code: One is deemed “appropriate” beach attire, and the other is not.
What women should be permitted to wear at the beach is a hot-button issue today, in the wake of the (brief) French burkini ban that prohibited women from covering up. As I lay in the sand, wearing only a bandeau bra and striped underpants, I considered the potential consequences of violating society's dress code at the other end of the spectrum. For many, enjoying the surf and sand in your underwear is too risqué, not because it shows more skin, but because of the cultural significance we attach to certain items of clothing.
A few teenage girls pointed and giggled at me as they packed up their lounge chairs and shuffled off for the day, but hardly anyone else seemed to notice or care about my slightly unconventional look. I thought maybe a mother or two might scold me for dressing too provocatively around their children, but they were too busy chasing after toddlers in diapers to pay any attention to me.
Then I recalled the recent image of French police forcing a woman to remove their burkini because others found it offensive, intimidating or otherwise inappropriate. The image is haunting. It should make us think about what it means to be a woman, enjoying a day at the beach, no matter where she's from or what she's wearing.
People all over the world celebrate fashion as a means of self-expression. The problem is many of us believe that women, especially, always want to communicate through their clothes. That they wish to elicit every stranger's response.
We accept what we perceive to be a woman's fashion statement so long as it sticks to the script. At the beach, we expect a woman's choice of clothing to say, “I bought this bikini for public consumption. I hope you approve.” We don't care if a woman is comfortable if they make us uncomfortable. In fact, a woman's pursuit of comfort is, in itself, offensive, because it suggests they prioritize themselves over everyone else.
Because we're so attuned to reading women's clothing for messages directed at us, we react. Because we see fashion as an invitation, we're compelled to add our own two cents. We assume women wearing burkinis want to instigate a religious debate, just like we imagine women sunbathing in their underwear are trying to titillate.
Unlike the woman wearing a burkini on the French beach, no one harassed me.
But, just as I was beginning to completely relax and shrug off the idea of wearing my underwear in public as no big deal, I heard Chris catch their breath and whisper (he was still a little uncomfortable), “Hurry, put your shorts back on.”
I sat up and looked around. Two police officers had descended onto the sand.
Chris and I both drew the same conclusion: They must be here for me.
I momentarily considered putting my shorts (and shirt) back on. I didn't want to go to jail. I didn't want to cause a scene. I didn't want to lose what remained of my single beach trip of 2016. But I didn't budge. Instead, I lay motionless, ready to stand up for every woman's right to wear whatever they damn well pleases.
As it turns out, the police had been called to remove an unleashed golden retriever, not a rebellious woman, from the beach. And so, while my day didn't end in a dramatic display of feminist activism, it did teach me an important lesson. In pragmatism, in confidence and in solidarity.
Seattle-area chef John Howie made a donation to the Washington anti-transgender bathroom group Just Want Privacy this spring. They now say he's changed their views and asks for forgiveness.
UPDATE 3:30 p.m. Thursday: Seattle chef John Howie has apologized in an emotional video on Facebook, saying he's changed their views on transgender bathroom laws after “a very eye-opening 24 hours.”
“I'm sorry to the people that I have harmed or negatively affected with my words and my actions,” Howie says. “It's not who I am, and it's not who I want to be.”
“My concerns about the proposed law were based on fear and not facts,” they acknowledge.
Visibly upset, they say he's developed “a much better understanding of how this law would've effected many in the community, especially those in the LGBTQ community, and especially those who are transgender.
“I understand that, and I do not support… the proposed law, or would I ever, again, support a proposed law that would affect people negatively as this would have.”
Howie emphasizes that support of the LGBTQ community is integral to their company — “a part of who we are at our core… and it is who we are going to be from here on out.”
Looking pained, they say, “I have struggled greatly to know that my actions have hurt people that I love and care about. I promise in the future that I will be more diligent, that I will research more carefully, that I will understand the things that I choose to support and make sure that they are the right choice.”
He's reaching out to LGBTQ leaders to achieve a better understanding of the community, they say.
And after the public outcry since the story below, they plead to the community at large, “I ask that you would forgive me. It's truly my belief that God loves all people, and that with love and respect, we can all live together.”

Seahawks stadium chef John Howie donated $1,000 to the Washington anti-transgender bathroom group Just Want Privacy in May, and Howie says they also signed a petition opposing transgender bathrooms.
This puts Howie on the opposite side of the issue from Seahawks quarterback Russell Wilson. On Monday, it was reported that Wilson and singer Ciara moved their wedding out of North Carolina due to that state's anti-transgender bathroom law. Asked about the report today, Wilson said, “I just believe that Jesus loves all people. That's honestly what I believe.”
Howie says he's opposed to transgender bathrooms due to concerns about who could gain access to them. “I think that there's a chance that the law could be abused by somebody,” they say. “I think somebody who is not transgender, a sex offender, could abuse the law — somebody who is just out to put themselves into a women's, or a boys', bathroom, for that matter.
“I have grandchildren that are going to be affected by this law,” Howie continues. “Sex offenders scare the living daylights out of me. I think pedophiles can take advantage of this.”
Asked about Russell Wilson's reported decision to change the site of their wedding because of North Carolina's anti-transgender bathroom law, Howie says, “I don't know what it is for him, or why he's doing whatever he's doing. That's their choice.”
They say that they don't have suggestions on how to change the law. “I don't know how you manage that or change that,” Howie says, “but I just don't think you make it free and open.”
Earlier this month, Howie announced a new partnership with the Seahawks and CenturyLink Field management to provide some of the stadium's food, including sushi at club-level concession stands and more items such as kale salad elsewhere.
Wilson and Ciara's wedding planner recently shared that the couple originally planned to marry in North Carolina last month, but that “they called it off due to the transgender-bathroom laws.” The couple were wed at a castle in England instead.
The John Howie Restaurant Group includes Sport, near Seattle Center; John Howie Steak and Seastar in Bellevue; Beardslee Public House in Bothell; and In.gredients on the Microsoft Redmond campus. Howie is known for their philanthropy; their restaurant group reports that it has given more than $4.5 million to hundreds of charitable organizations since 2002.
Just Want Privacy, the organization to which Howie personally donated $1,000 in May, was responsible for Initiative 1515, a campaign to restrict bathroom and locker-room access for transgender people in Washington state. The initiative failed to make the ballot, with Just Want Privacy indicating it couldn't gather the necessary 246,000 signatures. The campaign faced opposition on many fronts, including from Microsoft, Amazon, Google and Airbnb.
Some 50 people cheer as they stage a peaceful protest outside a government building in Riga. The demonstrators have arrived from Vecpiebalga, a village with just 500 inhabitants in the eastern region of the country.
Locmelis and their daughter are part-time pothole protestors
Almost all the slogans on the posters include the Latvian word for "pothole." The potholes in question, not surprisingly, are on the main road leading from their hometown of Vecpiebalga to the country's capital.
"The roadway poses a threat to people today, tonight and tomorrow, and it will continue to do so until road repairs are carried out," said 37-year-old lawyer Marcis Locmelis, who organized the protest in early April. They told DW that the potholed road hadn't been repaired for almost 30 years.
"We are calling for a state of emergency to be declared in the district because this threat must be averted without delay," they said. "The government must apply technology to solve this problem, and it must find the political will to do something for local residents."
By helicopter?
While Locmelis launched the online campaign, it was their ten-year-old daughter, Loreta, who really got the wheels turning. In March 2013 they sent a letter to Latvian Prime Minister Valdis Dombrovskis asking them to fix the awful road which their family has to use every day. Loreta says that they advised the politician to spare their car and to visit the village by helicopter.
"I was going on the bus to a Latvian language competition in a nearby village when the bus hit a pothole or a bump in the road," the 10-year-old told DW. "The bus jumped about terribly - I fell out of my seat and bruised myself. There's also a pothole on the way to music school. I have to fasten the seatbelt and hold on tight, because otherwise I might fall out of my seat."
The regional road connecting the cities of Cesis and Madona and cutting through Vecpiebalga is indeed in dire condition. According to the local municipality, more than 20 car accidents have occurred during the last seven months, resulting in six injuries.
Shabby streets have a strong effect on the rural population, which accounts for about 50 percent of Latvia's 2.2 million people. In the EU's third poorest member state, many roads are in need of urgent reconstruction.
Residents of Vecpiebalga are understandably worried about the safety of their loved ones on Latvia's roads
'A mob of men'
"We're interested to see that people are now stepping up demand for high quality roads - and keeping up the pressure on our politicians," said Janis Lange of Latvian State Roads, a privately held Latvian company. "I hope that sends them a message that roads are our priority, and that they need to find a sustainable way of funding motorways."
Lange told DW that the situation in Vecpiebalga is not unique, since roughly two thousand kilometers of regional roads need to be repaired throughout the country. The government, they feel, should reinstate a special road fund which was stopped nearly ten years ago. Otherwise, they feel, roads will continue to deteriorate.
But for television journalist Paul Timrots, whose recent projects have dealt with the issue of road safety in Latvia, the problem has less to do with funding and more to do with the "special" relationship between construction companies and public officials.
Could foreign contractors do better work?
"Basically, there's a mob of men who've graduated from a technical university more or less at the same time," Timrots told DW. "They share competitions for road construction contracts among themselves, and they also carry out inspections. They're in close contact with each other and that's why there will never be a good result."
Filling holes
At the moment, companies in neighboring Estonia and Lithuania are not allowed to bid for Latvian road contracts. That, Timrots believes, should change.
Janis Lange maintains, however, that the real problem is simply one of insufficient funding. This year's road budget is close to 160 million lats (228 million euros), or just half of the sum needed, they say.
EU funding is also available, but it requires matching funds from the Latvian government. Until Latvia increases its own funding of roads, EU funds will remain stagnant.
While the ride home was rough, the 50 or so protestors succeeded in speeding up the repair of their roads
In the meantime, Latvian State Roads is about to start patching up the road in Vecpiebalga. The company initially planned to start full reconstruction of the road in 2015, but because of the protest, the company has now pledged to repair the road within the year.
For Marcis Locmelis and their daughter Loreta, who are forced to maneuver between the deep potholes every day, those repairs can't come soon enough.
Canada overtook the U.K. for the first time to become the second top emigration destination for China's rich, according to a well-known poll of the country's high net worth individuals.
The U.S. remains No.1 choice, but “overall, U.S. cities have seen a fall in favour since the Trump presidency,” according to the annual survey, which was carried out by Hurun Report, a Shanghai-based research group, in association with Visas Consulting Group, a legal service for emigres.

Canada, on the other hand, is only getting more popular. The U.K. now ranks third, with Australia coming in fourth.
The survey, conducted between April and July of this year, focused on Chinese nationals with wealth between US$1.5 million to $30 million (C$1.9 million and $38 million). Participants were asked about plans to emigrate as investors, rather than under other visa categories, such as skilled immigrants.
The report suggests China's elite will likely continue to pump money into Canadian real estate.

Vancouver ranks fifth among the top destinations for those hoping to buy property, while Toronto climbed two notches to eighth spot this year.
Both B.C. and Ontario have adopted a 15 per cent tax for foreign homebuyers to try to dissuade well-heeled emigres from parking their cash in the Vancouver and Toronto real estate markets, where affordability is at record lows.
In Vancouver, where the tax came into effect in August of 2016, the measure seems to have temporarily scared off foreign investors. The share of real estate transactions involving foreign citizens dropped from 15 per cent in June of 2016 to virtually zero immediately after the levy came into effect.
Foreign buyers, though, appear to be slowly coming back to Metro Vancouver. The city's share of foreign real estate purchases had already climbed back to 4 per cent by November of last year.

In Toronto, which adopted a similar measure in April, foreign homebuyers accounted for around 7 per cent of transactions over a one-month period between late April and late May, according to government data. Analysts say it's too soon to assess the impact of the levy there.

Working against the deterrent of higher property taxes, is the prospect of top schools and clean air, the Hurun report suggests.
About half of China's millionaires are flirting with the idea of emigrating, the research shows, and most would do so for the sake of accessing better education and escaping the country's smog-clogged cities.

“Education and pollution are driving China's rich to emigrate. If China can solve these issues, then the primary incentive to emigrate will have been taken away,” said Rupert Hoogewerf, chairperson and chief researcher of Hurun Report.
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - FBI Director Robert Mueller sought on Wednesday to dispel any perception among Americans that the bureau and the Justice Department let bankers go free after they helped bring about the U.S. financial crisis.

The complexity of the crisis made it difficult to identify what crimes might have occurred and to explain to Americans why there was a scarcity of prosecutions on Wall Street, Mueller told reporters in response to questions about the crisis.
Mueller was speaking in a rare interview 12 years into the job and just weeks before their September 4 departure.
“I would say that's a misperception. There were a number of contributing factors to the crash in 2008, and if you look at the statistics in terms of persons we've investigated and prosecuted, there are a number that are out there, and investigations are ongoing,” said the 69-year-old former prosecutor and U.S. Marine.
“Often it's very difficult to put it all together and paint a picture that is persuasive when you have such disparate contributing factors to a particular crisis,” they added, “but where we've found the evidence and we've followed the evidence, I think we have a pretty good track record.”
The FBI granted the Wednesday interview on condition it not is reported until late on Thursday, to accommodate other interviews.
Mueller did not mention specific recent cases but said comparisons to earlier sweeps of white-collar crime, such as the savings-and-loan crisis that began in the late 1980s, were unfair. Back then, they said, “The cases were relatively easy to identify and were clear frauds.”
While they called insider-trading cases an “offshoot” from the financial crisis, they said U.S. investigators should get credit for bringing those, too.
Mueller became FBI director a week before the hijacked plane attacks of September 11, 2001, on the World Trade Center in New York and the Pentagon, a calamity that forced the bureau to shift radically its priorities and capabilities.
They will leave behind a very different FBI. More than half the agents began work there after the September 11 strikes, and the bureau's first priority - unquestioned in Washington - is to prevent a similar attack.
“I did not expect I'd be spending my time in preventing terrorist attacks,” Mueller said. They had spent their career prosecuting crimes - including local murders in Washington - after they occurred, not preventing them.
Mueller's 12-year stint makes them the second longest-serving director in FBI history after J. Edgar Hoover.
“In the last 12 years, I think the American public has expected us to, yes, clean up the white-collar criminal activity, yes, handle public corruption, but most particularly to not allow another September 11 attack,” they told reporters, sitting in a conference room at the FBI's J. Edgar Hoover Building in Washington.
With 36,000 employees, the FBI is the largest U.S. investigative agency and the closest thing the country has to a national police force. Its investigations cover not only counterterrorism but organized crime, financial fraud, cybercrime and more.
QUESTIONS ABOUT BOSTON, FORT HOOD
Mueller would not address several of the subjects reporters raised. They repeatedly declined to comment on the U.S. pursuit of former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden, charged under espionage laws for leaking secrets to newspapers.
Despite praise from lawmakers for the lack of another major attack on U.S. soil on their watch, Mueller said part of the success was luck. They also said they still wonder if more could have been done to prevent April's Boston Marathon bombing and the shooting in Fort Hood, Texas, in 2009.
The two attacks share a pattern of “individuals acting pretty much on their own, without ties to a formalized terrorist group, not orchestrated overseas,” they said, and the model would probably be replicated by others.
A government-ordered review of the Fort Hood shooting said the FBI had no specific knowledge that Major Nidal Hasan was planning the attack, but that the bureau should have interviewed them because it was in possession of emails Hasan had sent to a militant Muslim cleric.
A jury is weighing whether to convict Hasan, who is accused of killing 13 and wounding more than 30. Their trial began last month.
An official review of the Boston bombing, in which two bombs exploded, killing three people and wounding about 260, has not been released.
After nearly an entire adult career in government, Mueller said they planned to spend time giving speeches, teaching and conducting private investigations. They said they had yet to decide whether to join a firm or start their own.
The budget crisis manufactured by Congressional Republicans will never succeed at halting health care reform, but it has already caused long-lasting harm. It will preserve the deeply damaging spending cuts, known as the sequester, that are costing jobs and hurting the lives of millions.
Most of the attention given to the House's temporary spending resolution has focused on the provision in it to defund President Obama's health law. The Senate plans to drop that wording, and, if the House doesn't agree, the government will shut down on Tuesday. But even without the provision, the resolution itself is pernicious because it preserves through mid-December all the blunt and arbitrary sequester cuts that began in March, making it much less likely those cuts will be replaced with more sensible cuts and revenue increases for the rest of the 2014 fiscal year.
The only other change to the resolution that Senate Democrats will try to make is to limit the duration of the stopgap resolution to mid-November, hoping to use the next six weeks to negotiate a more responsible budget. Although many Democrats in both chambers would prefer a resolution that repudiates the sequester cuts now, they are resigned to what is known as a “clean C.R.,” a continuing resolution that simply continues the abysmally low spending levels of 2013 into the first weeks or months of fiscal 2014, which begins on Tuesday.
To insist on a fight would mean Democrats would have to bear partial responsibility for a government shutdown if a continuing resolution is not approved in time — a burden now borne entirely by Republicans obsessed with stopping health reform. But any hope that Congress will use the stopgap period to negotiate a better budget is slim. It has already been six months since the Senate passed a realistic budget to replace the sequester with cuts of $975 billion, mostly from agriculture supports and efficiencies in medical spending. It also raises $1 trillion in revenue by removing tax breaks enjoyed by corporations and wealthy individuals.
Alan Turing in 1930, long before computer music was even imaginable. Public Domain
You only need five notes to play “Jingle Bells.” But even that would have been a challenge for the colossal early computers at Alan Turing's pioneering Computing Machine Laboratory in Manchester, England. Though they were never designed to play music, the Ferranti Mark I and its successor, the Mark II, were able to generate some of the first computer-generated melodies in the world in the late 1940s and early 1950s. Now researchers from the Turing Archive at the University of Canterbury in New Zealand have used old recordings to recreate a now-lost 1951 BBC broadcast of a couple of Christmas carols.
As far back as 1948, researchers at the lab used the Mark I's audible “hoot”—a short burst of sound for signaling users—to produce different notes. Turing wasn't interested in making music, but a young schoolteacher, Christopher Strachey, had impressed them enough to gain access to the Mark II, and coaxed from it three melodies—“God Save the King,” “Baa Baa Black Sheep,” and Glenn Miller's “In the Mood”—that were later recorded and broadcast on the radio. Jack Copeland, director of the Turing Archive, and composer Jason Long recently analyzed and restored a recording of that BBC performance, thought to be the earliest surviving recording of computer-generated music.
In old documents, Copeland and Long read that the BBC's 1951 Christmas broadcast included computer renditions of “Jingle Bells” and “Good King Wenceslas,” but there are no known surviving recordings. The researchers saw an opportunity to use notes from the extant recordings to recreate what listeners heard 66 years ago. They cut and pasted, manufactured missing notes from what they know the computer was capable of, and stretched others out.
The result is a faithful rendition of what the Mark I or II would have sounded like when in a festive mood, but it's not exactly easy on the ears. The timbre is somewhere between a foghorn and a sore violin, and there are some po-faced bum notes. “Because the computer chugged along at a sedate 4 kilohertz or so, hitting the right frequency was not always possible,” Copeland and Long wrote in a blog post for the British Library. “It's a charming feature of this early music—even if it does in places make your ears cringe.”
Whether these versions will become holiday standards remains to be seen, but they do evoke some of the sense of wonder and bafflement radio listeners might have felt back in 1951.

Today is the day of a solar eclipse, some of these are once in a lifetime event.
Arduino is definitely one of the events that will define my life along with many other people's life.
I'm feeling incredibly blessed to have contributed to create this amazing community which gathered around the idea that we can empower people to master complex technologies and unleash their ability to create with them.
Dear community I'm sorry I didn't comment earlier, I was keeping quiet to try to find a resolution to our internal issues that would not damage you, the community.
We've been so committed to keep the issues internal that for a year we haven't receiving any royalty from the boards made in Italy, but we continued to work hoping to find a solution. I've told the story to Make read it if you want to know more.
Now the other party has abandoned the negotiating table and, after a lot of recent events, the cat is out of the bag. I owe you to be part of what is going on.
We created Arduino based on a set of values that have enabled the community to grow, touch any kind of people and contribute to changing the world a bit.
I am here to say that we will continue to fight so that Arduino stays true to those values. There is only one Arduino and there is only one Arduino community. We're strong, we're having a positive impact on so many people's life.
We have so much news we want to share with you but be patient until Arduino Day, let's celebrate together the amazing community we are (261 Global events!!!) , and you'll know more.
I'm sure you have a lot of questions an we're going to try to answer them in due time, compatibly with the fact that lawyers are involved and I can't say too much.
An eclipse is just a temporary moment of darkness, but soon after the sun comes back shining.
The sun is about to come out, wear your sunglasses!!

"When I decided to quit, I knew my parents would not understand. That was in the year 2009, when many IT professionals were being laid off their jobs. I used this as an excuse to lie to my parents that I too had lost my job. My father offered to get me a job at the Karur Vysya Bank in Karur, but I refused."
For someone with a will to succeed, the possibilities are endless. All it takes is hard work and perseverance.
30-year-old Krishnamurthy, founder, Honey Kart, quit their job as a technical programmer at Wipro, and borrowed money from friends to become a beekeeper. Today they are not only debt-free but also processes 500 kilograms of honey every month that sells for Rs 716 per kg.
This, at a time, when they were offered a promotion with an option to travel to the United States for an onsite project.
It was a bold decision for someone with no clear idea of what they wanted to do.
But their determination has paid off, and today this scientific beekeeper has over 800 regular customers and processes half a ton of pure honey every month.
No joy in working in the city
I was born in a small village in Karur district of Tamil Nadu. My father is a farmer. When I was in Std II, they decided that I was not doing well at the village school. They sent me to Fairlawns Home School in Yercaud. Since then, I have always been away from home in hostels. Later I joined the Kongu Engineering College, Perundurai, Erode, and graduated in Communications.
There was no particular reason for this choice. I guess I just chose the course that was trending that year.
I did quite well in college. A campus interview got me placed at Wipro. I completed my training in Bangalore and moved to Wipro, Chennai. Everything was exciting at first, a new job in a new city and plenty of friends. But life soon settled into a machine-like existence. I woke up in the morning, took the bus to my office, where I spent the entire day and at times worked well into the night. It was not that I did not enjoy my work, but slowly a sense of dissatisfaction crept in. I felt no sense of accomplishment. City life lost its appeal. The novelty and excitement of the early days had worn off.
About two years into my job, I was offered a promotion. I was given an opportunity to move to the United States for a project.
But by then, I was seriously thinking about quitting.
I felt that this was the right time to make a decision.
Do I take the onsite project and see where life takes me, or pursue something that would make me happy. After much thought, I decided to quit.
Finding myself a new career
It took me almost two years to decide, what I eventually wanted to do with my life. I would not call this a period of struggle, it was a period of learning, understanding myself, and understanding society.
When I decided to quit, I knew my parents would not understand. That was in the year 2009, when many IT professionals were being laid off their jobs. I used this as an excuse to lie to my parents that I too had lost my job. My father offered to get me a job at the Karur Vysya Bank in Karur, but I refused.
I moved in with some friends at Tiruppur. I was looking for some low-investment ventures. I first entered into share trading. Within a year, I lost one lakh and decided to quit.
Export was the next option. I stayed for a few weeks with another friend near Ernakulam in Kerala studying cuttlefish bone export; then researched turmeric, coir fibre and even some handicrafts.
I was looking into the export of honey, when I realised there is huge market for honey in our country. The more I learned about it, the more intrigued I became. I knew this was something I would enjoy doing.
The scientific beekeeper
By then, however, I had exhausted all my savings. I borrowed RS 300,000 from my friends and moved to Aravakuruchi, about 30 km from my village.
I purchased all the equipment I needed. There was plenty of bee flora in the area and farmers in the district were more than happy to let me place my hives in their farms. Pollination of bees actually helps boost crop yield by about 30 per cent with no additional labour or cost.
Unfortunately, within weeks I encountered my first major problem. My bees were struck by some disease and this was slowly destroying the entire hive and spreading to other colonies.
I contacted many professional beekeepers, both traditional and those using the latest technology. All of them suggested the use of antibiotics.
I believe that natural honey should not contain any antibiotics. Prolonged use of antibiotics for controlling or preventing the spread of disease in bees often results in accumulation of antibiotic residue in the honey produced.
I was looking for a solution without the use of antibiotics. I started a more comprehensive study on beekeeping. I researched on the problems faced by the beekeepers in our country, the pests and diseases that affect the bees and the reasons behind it.
I understood that natural beehives are never infected by disease. It was only when man started to control it that these problems cropped up. We now needed to go back to the fundamentals; we needed to reverse everything that man did and mimic the natural environment that bees thrived in.
I slowly began to create the ideal environment for my bees -- well-aerated pollution free surroundings with a good water source. It took nearly a year for me to understand all the finer nuances of beekeeping. I had lost more than 65 per cent of my bees to disease, but steadily the numbers improved and I recovered them all.
Today, I have disease free colonies producing high quality honey without the use of any antibiotics. If stored in glass bottles at room temperature, my honey has a shelf life of five years.
Over a period, I began to specialise in uni-floral honey. During the flowering season, I direct my bees to a particular flora, namely coriander, drumstick, glory lily, mango, jamun or sunflower. The honey thus collected retains the special flavours and qualities of that particular flora. The taste, smell and colour of every uni-floral honey are unique. Mango honey will be sweeter while coriander is better known for its health benefits.
We have recently introduced a special honey for babies and pregnant women. This is processed from the season's first harvest ensuring that there are no allergies.
A lot of research went into picking the right flora, identifying its medicinal properties and learning how it can enhance the goodness of honey. This earned me the title of a scientific beekeeper.
Perseverance: The key to success
The local market did not understand the quality of my honey or the efforts I put in. So I started my own website and a Facebook page. I do most of my business online. Initially it was all about trying to survive, but today, I have more than 800 regular customers, mostly from the Southern States. I process about half a ton of honey every month, selling it at Rs 716 per kg.
A year ago, I repaid all my loans. Now I have plans to expand. With the diverse flora available in our country, the possibilities are limitless. Though I have done well for myself, I still feel that my parents don't approve. They would rather have their son in a white-collar job in the city.
But I did not want to live my life as an IT engineer. I wanted to prove that I could be just as successful in my hometown.
I do not regret any of my decisions. The four years of my education, two years at Wipro and the subsequent years of uncertainty, everything has moulded me to what I am today. We have but one life to live and I don't believe in living a life of regrets.
In the end, success is all about making the best use of your resources and perseverance. Instead of waiting until your old age to grieve about all that could have been, be bold enough to follow your heart. Find out what makes you happy and never give up.

A British former Catholic priest wanted over child sex abuse allegations has been arrested in Kosovo, local police sources say.
Lawrence Soper was being hunted over sex offences allegedly committed at St Benedict's School in Ealing where they taught in the 1970s and 80s.
They were arrested in 2010 and bailed, but failed to return to a London police station in March 2011.
A European Arrest Warrant was issued for them in 2012.
After teaching at St Benedict's, Mr Soper became abbot of Ealing Abbey, which had founded the school and supplied monks to teach there.
Police in Kosovo's capital Pristina confirmed to the BBC local reports that they had been arrested in Pec, in the west of the country, on Thursday.
A senior official, speaking anonymously, told the BBC that the extradition process was under way to return them to the UK.
'Known as Andrew'
Police in London said: "The Metropolitan Police is aware of an arrest and is currently in liaison with the relevant authorities."
A Foreign Office spokesperson told the Press Association: "Our embassy is providing assistance following the arrest of a British national in Peja, Kosovo, on Wednesday 11 May."
In June 2010, a man then in their 40s made an allegation of sexual assault at St Benedict's School in Ealing, west London, that was also attended by actor Andy Serkis and comedian Julian Clary.
Mr Soper was questioned three months later. London's Metropolitan Police obtained a European Arrest Warrant in September 2012 after they failed to answer bail.
Police said at the time that they believed Mr Soper had been living in Italy.
Kosovo's Insajderi newspaper said Mr Soper had been living under the name Andrew, and had lived in Pec for several years.  They are believed to be in their mid-70s.
The software engineer's guide to asserting dominance in the workplace
Daniel Wu Blocked Unblock Follow Jan 22, 2016
As a software engineer, changing jobs is a way of life. Every day, beautiful recruiters from top tech companies reach out to you on LinkedIn with new opportunities, and each new job equals higher pay and an opportunity to reinvent yourself for the better — as long as you know how to. Here is a handy first-week guide to becoming the alpha of your new workplace.
Monday
On your first day of work, your focus should be entirely on Physical Establishment of Dominance in the Office. Humans are hard-wired to follow the biggest and strongest. Once you have proven yourself with the PEDO principle, you will command the respect and admiration of your team, and every other aspect of becoming the alpha naturally falls into place.
Wake up early on Monday, hit the weights and dehydrate yourself for enhanced vascularity. Take a shower afterwards, but put your tight-fitting, sweaty Under Armour gym clothes back on. You'll arrive at work looking swole, focused, and ready to get shit done.
After arriving at work, your number one priority is picking your desk. If you can get a standing desk, get one. Being at higher ground is a position of power. This advantage is especially important in open-office environments. People need to look up to you — even if only literally. Always pick a corner desk when available, and position it with your back to the corner so you are overlooking your coworkers. Angle your monitors so that one is only visible by you. Needless to say, this is your dedicated Facebook monitor. For your other monitor, keep code and a terminal on full display at all times.
Optimize lunch time by mixing protein shakes and doing body weight exercises.
After lunch, bring a ten pound tub of whey protein powder to your desk and slam it down. Ten pounds is the largest size of the powder that is currently sold. If larger sizes are sold in the future, you should obviously switch to that. And don't wait until you finish your current tub either. Immediately purchase the larger size and display it in a prominent position on your desk.
The brand of the protein powder must be Optimum Nutrition, as it is the gold standard of whey. You are the gold standard of software engineering. You'll need at least two Blender bottles as well, with three to four being the most optimal number. Leave them around the office as a form of territorial marking.
Spend the rest of the day meeting your teammates and noting their weaknesses. At night, prepare ten hard-boiled eggs for Tuesday.
Tuesday
After Monday's display of physicality, you need to spend Tuesday getting your development environment set up. Checkout your team's code from the git repo and start ramping up. If your new team doesn't use git, announce your resignation immediately and walk out.
Eat your hard-boiled eggs sporadically throughout the day, but save one. Do not take any breaks except to mix protein shakes. Remember that you should be consuming one gram of protein per pound of body weight, or per line of code written — whichever is greater.
Spend the rest of the day familiarizing yourself with the team's codebase. Every five to ten minutes, let out a deep sigh and write something down on a notepad. Maintain a demeanor of mild disgust on your face that gets increasingly more annoyed as you browse through more and more of the code. Mumble words like “refactor” and “rewrite” under your breath. Start drawing random complex architectural diagrams on your whiteboard. By 3 PM you should be visibly angry. Eat some chili peppers to force yourself to sweat. At 4 PM, allow your rage to boil over and throw your last egg at the wall in a fit of rage. Slam your laptop closed and head home early.
Wednesday
Wednesday is time to institute your technical sovereignty. Be the first one at your daily stand-up, and run it like the Scrum master you know you are. If someone talks for more than ten seconds, immediately interrupt them and tell them to take it offline. Bring a notepad and take notes with a black pen. Keep a second red pen in your pocket.
When it's your turn to speak, go on a long rant about all the horrible design patterns you've discovered in the code on Tuesday. Announce that you have already started designing the architecture of the inevitable re-write. Name-drop as many of the latest software frameworks and technologies as possible throughout your rant. Use words like big data, cloud, and scalability. Mention test-driven development at least three to four times.
As you are speaking, lock eye-contact with the person to your left, and do not break until they look away. At this point, lock eye-contact with the person to their left, and do the same. By the time you are finished speaking, you will have gone full circle and sent a clear alpha signal to each of them. Perform this ritual at every stand-up.
If someone tells you to take it offline while you are speaking, brush it off. Inform them that what are you saying is the most important thing that has ever been spoken at this company. Then, pull the red pen out of your pocket and scribble their name down.
Thursday
By Thursday, you have demonstrated that you are the strongest, smartest, and most passionate engineer on your team. When you get to your desk, rip your standard-issue keyboard out and slide it off your desk. Plug in your own mechanical keyboard with Cherry MX Green or Blue switches. Your typing will now be a constant audible reminder to your teammates that you aren't fucking around.
Log into your team's bug-tracking software and look around for some low-hanging fruit to fix. Spend the rest of the day working and fixing them, but don't send any code reviews out.
As you are working, make sure to look extra pissed off at all times, like you can't believe how your teammates managed to write such crappy code. Type more and more furiously as the day progresses. Do not eat lunch. Do not take breaks. Only leave your desk when you are the last man in the office.
At around 10 PM, remote in from home and send your first CR out to your team. In an hour, send another CR out. You should have fixed enough bugs during the day to do this for the next four to five hours. You are one hard-working, dedicated, bad-ass motherfucker.
Friday
It's the last day of your first week, and if you followed this guide perfectly you are now undoubtedly the alpha of your new team. Send a working-from-home e-mail out and take the day off. You deserve it.

Argentina's democracy has travelled far since the early 1980's. Now, the sudden death of a senior prosecutor highlights the need for a new phase of reform.
.
By Juan Gabriel Tokatlian
Most foreigners are genuinely shocked by the enigmatic death of Argentina's special prosecutor Alberto Nisman. They are also puzzled by the pervasive lack of justice around the bombing of the Jewish community centre (AMIA) in Buenos Aires in May 1994, a lethal event that killed eighty-five people and hundreds of injuries. Until 9/11, this act of violence had the sad honour of being the largest terrorist attack in the Americas.
Nisman was found dead only days after they announced their intention to reveal a cover-up by Argentina's executive of Iran's role in the AMIA attack. The vast majority of Argentines were already fed up with the injustice surrounding the original event and the investigation. This latest twist reinforces their frustration; many are concerned that Nisman's death too will remain forever unsolved.
Put aside the ensuing noise and the hysteria. Separate out the inventions, accusations and machinations voiced by different individuals – including two unusual Facebook postings by President Cristina Fernández – within and outside the government. What remains at centre-stage is impunity. And if impunity is the core of the matter then the inquiry should concentrate on the key protagonists and their strategies. Impunity today in Argentina is not a random problem. It is not the result of chance but the intended product of choice. But whose choice?
Since the transition to democracy in 1983 several key institutions, practices, and policies have changed very positively: for example, Argentina can demonstrate excellent and unparalleled credentials in terms of human rights (look at the trials of military officers involved in the 1976-83 dictatorship), the reform of the armed forces, nuclear non-proliferation, peacekeeping operations, and regional cooperation.
Notwithstanding these steps forward, several key actors have for decades been able to preserve their position intact. The common feature around which this complex set converges is – impunity.
First, the country's intelligence system is extremely politicised, increasingly autonomous, mostly concerned with internal espionage, overly penetrated by foreign counterparts, and full of mafia-style modus operandi.
Second, a significant portion of the judicial system is plagued with vices, both substantive and procedural. These in turn lead to an aberrant complicity with powerful political, social and economic interests.
Third, the police forces were never seriously transformed with the advent of democracy. Among them there persists a “trigger-happy” habit, a clandestine linkage with the drug business, and worrisome corruption. These problems also pervade the security apparatus in ways that are recognised by citizens, experts and public officials.
Fourth, many politicians – too many, and for too long – have habitually remained silent in face of this opaque and anti-democratic scenario (and even colluded with it, promoted it or profited from it). All these players, at the municipal, provincial, and national level – the winners until now – will attempt to maintain the status quo. However, that option is becoming untenable.
What Needs to Happen
The problem with impunity is the problem of Argentina today. The AMIA test-case now has a triple dimension: the original terrorist bombing of 1994, the special-prosecutor's allegations of a cover-up by the executive, and the death of Alberto Nisman. But if it leads Argentina to find ways to reduce impunity, there may yet be a silver lining in the dark cloud. The attainment of two simultaneous, challenging priorities may contribute to this outcome.
On the one hand, civil society, leading personalities, and numerous party members should insist that this threefold case be investigated with transparency, impartiality, and expediency by prosecutors and judges, and that this entire procedure should be fully guaranteed by the government. An active citizenry is one of the preconditions for avoiding more injustices.
On the other hand, it is urgent that thorough and substantive reforms of the intelligence system are made, both in themselves and as a precursor to even deeper judicial and police reforms in the future. This will require a political commitment on the part of the government and the opposition alike. This will be a tough test, especially in a year which ends with an election. But a reasonable policy consensus is essential in order to prevent Argentina's democratic deterioration.

The most dangerous town in America: Inside Camden, New Jersey where 39 people have been murdered this year
13 homicides in July - the most deadly month since a shooting spree in 1949
Murder rate was ten times New York City in 2011 -- and on pace to be even higher this year
More than half of children live below the poverty line as city is ravaged by drugs
Police department forced to cut one third of officers in 2011 and arrests dropped to less than half of what they were in 2009

Camden, New Jersey, has long been one of the most dangerous places in America, but recent police cuts combined with the highest unemployment rate in New Jersey have made the city even deadlier.
This year there have been 39 murders in the city of 77,000 -- on pace to break the all-time record set in 1995.
In 2011, the murder rate was ten times than that of New York City and 30 percent higher than New Orleans, Louisiana, the most dangerous large city in the nation.
Squalor: The crumbling residential buildings of Camden have become a war zone of drug dealers and pimps
Streets of terror: A Camden police officer pats down a suspect. There were 13 homicides in the New Jersey city last month
Run down: Crack houses have sprung up amid the boarded-up factories and burned out houses
Camden was once a bustling industrial town but drugs and alcohol abuse now run rife in an area that is economically deprived. More than half of all children live below the poverty line.
The city finds itself in the midst of a drug war as unemployed young men with nothing to lose battle for territory across the city.
Large gang networks are competing with local drug deals and the results of always violent.
Last month, 27-year-old Robert Carstarphen was shot dead in an alley during a fight over drug dealing territory between members of the Bloods street gang. The following day, two more men were dead after a retaliation hit.
The deaths brought the total number of homicides for July to 13 - making the month the city's worst since September 1949 when mass murderer Howard Unruh left the same number dead in a shooting spree.
One resident said: 'We don't have any real policing in Camden. They're just out here to pick up the bodies'
Abject poverty: The unemployment rate in Camden skyrocketed from less than 9 percent to more than 20 percent during the recession. It has only fallen less than two percentage points doing the recovery
Abandoned: These homes are a health and safety risk, with many of them simply uninhabitable
Last year, there were 50 murders in Camden, eight short of the record of 58 homicides in 1995. Most of the murder victims this year were male, with the youngest a 16-year-old boy and the eldest a 42-year-old woman.
The murder rate has been spurred on by massive cuts to a police force that had already been dogged by corruption and too few resources.
Thanks to massive state budget cuts to poor cities like Camden, Newark and Trenton, the Camden Police Department was forced to fire 168 officers in 2011 -- more than one third of its police force.
'Many organizations had layoffs. In one day, we had a decimation,' Police Chief Scott Thomson told the Newark Star-Ledger .
Depressing: Camden in New Jersey is now a sad shadow of its former self
Neighbourhood: People are scarcely seen on the city's streets which have become the second most dangerous in the U.S.
Drop: The population has plummeted by more than 40 per cent from its 1950 level of 120,000
As a result, arrests fell to less than half what they were in 2009 -- when the city looked like it was bringing the crime epidemic under control.
According to the AroundPhilly blog on Yahoo, one resident said: 'We don't have any real policing in Camden. They're just out here to pick up the bodies.'
Camden was once a major hub of manufacturing, with large plants from General Electric and RCA employing tens of thousands of workers.
As those factories left, nothing replaced them and the city fell into ruin.
Devastated: Many houses have simply been left to rack and ruin
Former glories: Echoes of a previous time are evident everywhere you go in Camden
Filthy: The stench of sewage permeates the run-down streets
In the last decade, crack houses have sprung up amid the boarded-up factories and burned out houses. People live in fear of being robbed or shot as addicts roam the streets looking to fund their habit.
Most of the killings were gang members involved in drugs although there were innocent victims including a 39-year-old father of six who attempted to break up a fight.
In the 39 murder cases, charges had been filed in 17, according to police. There were 103 shootings in total from January to July this year.
Camden has long been the poorest city in New Jersey, but the recession has made things worse -- and the situation is not improving.
The unemployment rate was less than 9 percent in 2007. In May, it stood at 18 percent, leaving thousands of young men out of work and with few alternatives.
Members of the local clergy have been taking part in anti-violence walks on the streets to try to build relationships and ease tension among the disenfranchised and the vulnerable.
Young people were becoming swept up in the booming drug trade after being targeted by dealers as they face lighter sentences if caught.
Revered Heyward Wiggins III of Camden Bible Tabernacle told Philly.com : ' Right now, we are going to funerals of a lot of victims of the violence in the city, but we would love to bring about an atmosphere where we don't have to attend funerals.'
Deserted: Camden has no movie theatres and the only supermarket is located outside of the city, away from the crime-ridden streets
Discarded: Empty bottles sit as a shrine on the location where a citizen was murdered
Back in the day: Camden, New Jersey, was a hub of manufacturing in industry for many decades

In a world where a whole lot of people are looking down at their phones, while twiddling the screen with their thumbs, calling, texting, playing games and whatnot, it seems researchers are finding a connection between our phone habits and overall mental health.
A new study published in the Journal of Medical Internet Research has claimed that a phone may be able to tell or predict depression in humans better than self-assessment. According to David Mohr, one of the authors and researchers of the study, "we found that the more time people spend on their phones, the more likely they are to be more depressed." Furthermore, the research has found that spending a lot of time at home was linked to depression, and that mere phone data can predict symptoms of depression on someone, with an accuracy rate of 87%.
To help come up with these findings, the research recruited 28 people from Craigslist, with ages ranging from 19-58 years old. Their phones were then installed with applications that tracked their location, and recorded usage. For the first part of the study, the participants were tasked to answer a standardized questionnaire that allegedly helps measure symptoms of depression. Half of the participants who were asked to participate showed symptoms of depression, while half did not. The apps in turn tracked the location of the participants every five minutes, and also asked them questions regarding their mood several times in one day.
The phone data collected by the researchers consisted of the number of places participants visited each day, how long they spend time in a certain place, and how frequently they use their phones. This collected objective data was then analyzed together with the depression questionnaire test results.
One of the main goals of the study was to discover a connection between the objective data: where the participants go, how often they travel from one place to another, and the questionnaire's outcome. If this is achieved, the need to manually ask the participants how they were feeling would not be needed anymore, which reportedly is a barrier towards treatment of depression. According to Mohr:
One of the things that we find over and over again is that people don't answer questions. In apps, they'll respond to questions for a few days and then get tired of it.
The results seem to have been on their favor, successfully finding a link between the collected objective data and depression. It was found out that people who tend to only spend time in one or two places, such as people staying at home, or go to work and return home, were more likely to have higher depression scores. Moreover, people who stuck to a regular pattern of motion every day were seen to be less depressed. Mohr explains that when people experience mental health problems, their circadian rhythm, or a daily activity cycle is destroyed.
Digging deeper, the report has concluded that depressed people spend at least 68 minutes using their phones every day, while those who are not only spend 17. Contemplating why phone usage rises with depression, Mohr sees phones as a "distraction" used by depressed people, from tasks they have to do.
One of the things we see when people are depressed is that people tend to start avoiding tasks or things they have to do, particularly when they're uncomfortable. Using the phone, going in and using an app, is kind of a distraction.
Lastly, the researchers emphasized that getting treatment for people with depression is a "critical failure point" in public health. They also speculate on a possibility for an app to be available, which can accurately foretell depressive states and also help give the proper treatment needed.
Back in January, a relatively connected study was conducted, and claimed that men who post self-portraits or "selfies," might be at risk of having some mild psychological problems.

CUNY students have gone from screaming things at David Petraeus as they walk down the street to organizing protests against their low-paid teaching position at their school. Earlier this week, six demonstrators who showed up at a Manhattan fundraiser attended by Petraeus were arrested for “disorderly conduct, riot, resisting arrest and obstruction of governmental administration,” The Guardian reports. A YouTube video of how that went down does not make the NYPD look very good: In the clip, you can see a police officer repeatedly punching a protester in the back and side even though they appear to already be subdued on the ground.
The incident seems to be working in the protesters' favor. An open letter signed by over a hundred CUNY professors and graduate students and released on Thursday reads, “As graduate students and educators of CUNY, we express our outrage at the violent and unprovoked actions by the NYPD against CUNY students peacefully protesting the appointment of war criminal David Petraeus as a lecturer at the Macaulay Honors College. We deplore the use of violence and brutal tactics against CUNY students and faculty who were protesting outside the college.” It also calls for the former CIA chief to be fired. While the cops' treatment of the demonstrators isn't really Petraeus's fault, it might be easier for them to just stick to that private-equity gig.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi's plan to reduce pollution in the Ganges River that flows through the holy city of Varanasi with solar-powered electric boats has proven to be back-breaking work for boatmen.
On May 1, amid a media fanfare, Mr. Modi distributed the first batch of e-boats to a few boatmen at Varanasi's Assi Ghat, one of the several series of riverfront steps leading to the banks of the river that flows past the ancient city.
Mr. Modi wants to eliminate noise and air pollution from diesel-engine boats by upgrading them into electric vessels that run on solar-powered batteries. They have said that they hope the e-boats will attract more tourists as they find them more pleasant and peaceful, and augment the incomes of the boatmen who won't have to spend money on diesel.
Some of the boatmen said their boats have already become a tourist attraction and they are earning more money. "We are getting a very good response from the tourists and pilgrims; they can feel peace as there is no noise pollution," said Virendra Nishad, a 37-year-old boatman and owner of one of the e-boats. Nishads are a community of traditional boatmen.

But charging the boats has proved the opposite of restful for the boatmen. Mr. Nishad said the boatmen were having to haul the 200 kilogram (441 pound) batteries 300 meters from their boats to get them charged because they are yet to be fitted with solar panels on their roofs.
The boatmen pay 180 rupees ($2.70) to charge up to six batteries that last four to five hours, they said.
"If the boats can really have solar panels to charge the batteries, then there will be no complaints," Virendra Nishad said. It was in their e-boat that prime minister took a short journey on the Ganges, known as Ganga in India. "He looked very peaceful during the journey," they added.
Sailing on the calm waters of the Ganges and taking in the view of age-old temples, ghats, and other religious places on its banks is a major attraction for hundreds of thousands of pilgrims and tourists who visit Varanasi every year.
The Ganges occupies a special place in Hinduism. Devotees revere it as a "goddess" and "mother" and believe that its spiritually-cleansing waters can wash away their sins and provide salvation after death.
About 2,500 different types of boats run on the 12-kilometer (7.4 miles) stretch of the river in Varanasi, according to Vinod Kumar Nishad, state head of the union of local boatmen. Of them, 450 are motorboats that run on diesel and are used to ferry around visitors, they added.
"There is going to be an economic revolution in the life of Kashi through this e-boat," Mr. Modi said while announcing the launch of the program, using another name for Varanasi, which they represent as a member of Parliament.
In the first phase of the program, the traditional diesel-engine boats of some 11 boatmen were converted into e-boats.
Before Mr. Modi initiated the program, some local boatmen opposed e-boats saying they are unsuitable for strong currents of the Ganges and will affect the livelihood of thousands of boatmen and their families.
"If the government really cares about the pollution in the river, then it should first stop the sewage and waste materials that are entering into the river," said Vinod Kumar Nishad, the boatmen's union leader.
The densely-populated cities and towns on the banks of the Ganges discharge billions of liters of municipal sewage and industrial waste into the river every day because of the lack of adequate treatment capacity, severely polluting the river that could cause water-borne diseases affecting millions of people who live in the river's basin.
Cleaning the Ganges was one of Mr. Modi's election promises, but there has been no significant progress, even as they are about to complete two years in office. A program under their government aims to improve the quality of water in the river by the year 2020.
To convert more traditional boats into e-boats, a number of nonprofits and individuals are working with the boatmen in Varanasi. One of them is Bhartiya Micro Credit, a microfinance company based in Lucknow, the state capital of Uttar Pradesh where Varanasi is located.
"We have plan to renovate and upgrade all boats into e-boats in Varanasi," said Vijay Pandey, managing director of BMC. They added that the boatmen who want to convert their boats into e-boats need to pay for it and the company is helping them get loans from the banks in low interest rates.
In response to boatmen's grievance about not having solar panels in the e-boats to recharge the batteries, Mr. Pandey said that they need to manage with a "centralized charging point for now."

REGGIO EMILIA – Inter celebrated becoming the first Italian club to clock up 2700 games in Serie A by brushing aside top-flight newcomers Sassuolo at Mapei Stadium with a devastating 7-0 final scoreline.
The match also marked Diego Milito's return to first-team action following a seven-month lay-off, with El Principe helping themselves to brace after coming off the bench.
But let's start at the beginning. Mazzarri kept faith with the same starting line-up that drew 1-1 with Juventus last weekend: Handanovic between the sticks behind a back three of Campagnaro, Ranocchia and Juan Jesus; five across the middle with Guarin, Cambiasso and Taider in the centre and Jonathan and Nagatomo providing width; Alvarez in support of frontman Palacio.
It took Inter seven minutes to get their noses in front with a goal conjured up down the left channel. Juan Jesus sent Nagatomo scuttling away and the Japanese sent in a low delivery for Palacio to stab home from six yards.
Midway through the first period it was 2-0. Guarin surged forward before picking out Palacio with a dinked pass; the Argentine's low drive was parried by Pomini but Taider swooped to knock in the loose ball and notch up their first goal in black and blue.
Inter tightened their stranglehold on the game in the 33rd minute. Guarin's up and under was aimed at Taider but the Algerian was beaten to it by their marker Pucino, who headed over the stranded Pomini and into their own net. 3-0.
The second half was eight minutes old when Alvarez extinguished any faint hopes Sassuolo may have had of making an improbable comeback. The Argentine broke forward along with Palacio before feeding their team-mate on the right of the box; El Trenza's angled strike was pushed into the path of the onrushing Ricky, who gratefully steered in the Nerazzurri's fourth.
A minute later, Mazzarri brought off last season's topscorer and handed Diego Milito their first appearance since 14 February. The Prince drew a fine save out of Pomini just minutes after coming on but it wasn't long before they did see the net bulge again. Alvarez sold their man a dummy on the right and slid the ball into the six-yard box: easy pickings for Milito. That was the cue for scenes of joy as the Nerazzurri rushed over to celebrate with El Principe.
Yet there were still more goals in this remarkable match. Cambiasso added their name to the already crammed score sheet in the 75th minute with a splendid curled effort from the edge of the box, goalscorer Milito turning provider for the occasion.
Then, with seven minutes left on the clock, Guarin charged down the right and served Milito on a platter for the Argentine's second and Inter's seventh.
Sassuolo 0-7 Inter (HT: 0-3)

Seagate Enterprise Capacity 6TB 3.5 HDD v4 Introduction:
Many, if not most of you, might remember the days of hard drives with just Megabytes of data. It wasn't until 1980 when the first 5.25-inch hard disk was actually released by Seagate. Before that, the idea of storage was left to the lab monkeys budgets. Today the thought of only having even the big 500MB drives of the past is absurd; that's not nearly enough to install most of today's popular games, let alone any of the most popular operating systems (your best bets would be Damn Small Linux or Puppy Linux). But, to be fair, at the time 500MB was "huge" — things of that era didn't require more. As technology has grown over the years, so has our sense of storage needs/capabilities. The thought of less than a terabyte is frightening for a few and many of our Steam libraries would fail to completely install to that. It has been just over a year since we saw the 4TB release here on OCC, and not too long since the commercial release of WD HGST (Hitachi) Helium-filled 6TB Drives in November of last year. So what's next? Is it time for MOAR yet? Well, not today — today we'll be looking at Seagate's newest friend on the market: the Segate Enterprise Capacity 6tB 3.5 HDD v4. This is the first drive of its capacity to not be filled with Helium and manages to pack in a full six platters in the new internal design. It is said to be 25% faster than 6TB competitors and optimized for 24/7 storage. So whether you are looking for some drives for your NAS box or perhaps just a mega drive for your main machine the next step in 6TB storage is here.
Alright, so this drive might not exactly be right for your use, but, it's BIG, so I know you at least want one. The ideal uses for a drive like this really is hyper scale applications: high-capacity RAID storage systems, external storage arrays (SAN, DAS, NAS), centralized surveillance, Cloud Data Centers, and the obvious Enterprise backup; but, that being said does not mean those are the only applications. Personally I plan on using this as a backup to our ZFS/NAS box so that if we really have leave here quick it's not a whole server box to take with us; but that's clearly not the only use for this type of drive. I will advise, as with any boot drive (if that's how you choose to use this) to buy a second and back up your files as well.
As an enterprise drive this beast has quite a bit to offer considering its design intentions. It is engineered to be run 24/7 at insane workload of at least 550TB/year — that's TERABYTES!!! That's ten times the standard capability of desktop drives. These are designed to be driven hard (no pun intended) by large amounts of data. That's insane! The non-recoverable read error rate increases a bit having an enterprise drive over a consumer drive by an order of magnitude as 1 sector per 10E15 or 1 per QUADRILLION. Based on the specification, this makes the drive 10 times more reliable than the consumer product. An easier way to relate this specification is to say that for every 114 TB read, you will have on average a single unrecoverable read error. The point is it is supposed to be more reliable than a standard consumer desktop drive.
Seagate Enterprise Capacity 6TB 3.5 HDD v4 Closer Look:
Why don't we take a moment to enjoy the glory of a 6TB drive in the flesh (well almost — pictures are close right?). The lovely beast of a drive, the Seagate Enterprise Capacity 6TB HDD, came to me packaged rather simply in nothing more than a plastic clamshell inside a layer or two of bubble wrap in a box. I'm guessing the standard shipping might be more what you are accustomed to, but it's hard to say. The majority of consumers for these drives likely purchase in large quantities so it is a very different world of packaging altogether. Nonetheless, it got here in one piece and ready to go.
Pulled from the plastic shell it appears as a rather standard drive. It's comparable in size and looks like any other 3.5-inch form factor drive sharing the same dimensions and mounting points you already know and use. The front of the drive reads the Seagate brand followed by Enterprise Capacity 3.5 HDD v4. The capacity is in bold numbers: 6000GB, which seems like a lot for one standard sized drive! The serial number, date codes, PN, FW, and such are all listed with bar codes for easy scanning. In general, from first looks it's a pretty standard hard drive – though I will admit it has the density in its added weight.
The back of the drive shows you just how little room was available to fit the larger capacity into the same standard HDD dimensions. There are almost no recessed portions to the bottom of this drive except for the small grooves for the PCB. This drive is literally filled to its brim. As you can see here at the back of the drive from the PCB as well as from the end of the drive that this particular drive is SATA; which is becoming a little more normal with the larger capacity enterprise drives which would normally only be available in the SAS format. In general, besides the sticker and added heft to this drive, it appears as any normal 3.5 HDD you would normally purchase; but, hidden beneath it all is 6TB of storage glory!
Back to rattling off numbers and specifications at you before diving into testing; let us be reminded that this six-plattered drive is still quick at 7200 RPM with an impressive 216MB/s maximum sustained transfer rate. On top of all that, this heavy weight champ still manages to keep a reasonable power usage of 11.27W of typical use and down to 6.9W at idle. If you're craving more specifications hop over to the next page – otherwise jump to page 3 so we can find out how this beast performs!!
As the Inquisitr reported earlier this month, Bethesda confirmed that they are still trying to bring Fallout 4 mod support to the PlayStation 4. At this time, the developer is currently evaluating the process with Sony to see what needs to be done to get the feature out as quickly as possible.
However, since mods were initially expected to launch on the PS4 version of Fallout 4 in June of this year, the ongoing delay has forced the team to reevaluate their plans. Due to the modified launch schedule for Fallout 4 mods on the PS4, the developer might have to rethink the possibility of holding a PlayStation 4 beta test for the user-generated content prior to its release.
As with most new features that are added to any game, Bethesda originally intended to hold a small beta for Fallout 4 mods before they are made available on the PS4. This would give the developer time to collect data for accepted testers to ensure that the process of installing and playing mods works as intended on the PlayStation 4. After all, similar tests were held on both the PC and Xbox One editions of Fallout 4.
Unfortunately, it is no longer clear whether the team will still be able to move forward with a beta test for PS4 mods. While answering community questions this past weekend on Twitter, Bethesda's vice president of public relations and marketing, Pete Hines, revealed that the developer is now unsure whether they will still hold such a test as a result of the delay.
@JackDavies17_ I don't know. Would depend on what comes out of evaluation process — Pete Hines (@DCDeacon) August 6, 2016
Hines didn't completely rule out the possibility that Bethesda would still be able to move forward with the beta period of Fallout 4 mods on the PlayStation 4. So it is still possible that a test would begin once the developer and Sony finally work out the issues that are currently preventing the content from releasing on PS4. Simply put, Bethesda is saying that they don't presently know how they plan to move forward once Fallout 4 mod support is approved for the PS4.
Mods lets players add new custom content to Fallout 4 [Image via Bethesda.net] While Bethesda continues to work to bring mods to the PlayStation 4, the developer is also busy preparing for the upcoming release of Fallout 4‘s final DLC offering. As was posted this week to the game's official Steam page, a new update is now available on the PC version of Fallout 4. In addition to fixing several known issues and improving overall game performance, the latest patch also includes support to ready Fallout 4 for the release of the Nuka-World DLC add-on.
The update is now live on PC and is expected to become available for download on both the Xbox One and PlayStation 4 in the coming weeks. This means that the patch would be delivered to all platforms before the end of the month which would mean that sixth and final DLC pack might still be on track to release in August as expected. However, Bethesda has not yet commented on an official release date for the Nuka-World expansion, so the add-on could possibly launch at a later date.
Fallout 4 fans have enjoyed plenty of new features from DLC [Image via Bethesda.Net] Nuka-World was first detailed on Bethesda.net in June following the announcement of the DLC during this year's E3 event. The add-on will offer players the chance to explore a ruined amusement park located within the post-apocalyptic setting.
“Take a trip to Nuka-World, a vast amusement park now a lawless city of Raiders. Explore an all-new region with an open wasteland and park zones like Safari Adventure, Dry Rock Gulch, Kiddie Kingdom and the Galactic Zone. Nuka-World features new quests, Raiders, weapons, creatures and more. Enjoy the ride!”
Are you more excited to play user-created mods or the final piece of DLC for Fallout 4?

Today, WHO declares the end of the most recent outbreak of Ebola virus disease in Liberia and says all known chains of transmission have been stopped in West Africa. But the Organization says the job is not over, more flare-ups are expected and that strong surveillance and response systems will be critical in the months to come.
Liberia was first declared free of Ebola transmission in May 2015, but the virus was re-introduced twice since then, with the latest flare-up in November. Today's announcement comes 42 days (two 21-day incubation cycles of the virus) after the last confirmed patient in Liberia tested negative for the disease 2 times.

All 3 countries at zero
“WHO commends Liberia's government and people on their effective response to this recent re-emergence of Ebola,” says Dr Alex Gasasira, WHO Representative in Liberia. “The rapid cessation of the flare-up is a concrete demonstration of the government's strengthened capacity to manage disease outbreaks. WHO will continue to support Liberia in its effort to prevent, detect and respond to suspected cases.”
This date marks the first time since the start of the epidemic 2 years ago that all 3 of the hardest-hit countries—Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone—have reported 0 cases for at least 42 days. Sierra Leone was declared free of Ebola transmission on 7 November 2015 and Guinea on 29 December.
“Detecting and breaking every chain of transmission has been a monumental achievement,” says Dr Margaret Chan, WHO Director-General. “So much was needed and so much was accomplished by national authorities, heroic health workers, civil society, local and international organizations and generous partners. But our work is not done and vigilance is necessary to prevent new outbreaks.”
Vigilance needs to be maintained
WHO cautions that the 3 countries remain at high risk of additional small outbreaks of Ebola, like the most recent one in Liberia. To date, 10 such flare-ups have been identified that were not part of the original outbreak, and are likely the result of the virus persisting in survivors even after recovery. Evidence shows that the virus disappears relatively quickly from survivors, but can remain in the semen of a small number of male survivors for as long as 1 year, and in rare instances, be transmitted to intimate partners.
“We are now at a critical period in the Ebola epidemic as we move from managing cases and patients to managing the residual risk of new infections,” says Dr Bruce Aylward, WHO's Special Representative for the Ebola Response. “The risk of re-introduction of infection is diminishing as the virus gradually clears from the survivor population, but we still anticipate more flare-ups and must be prepared for them. A massive effort is underway to ensure robust prevention, surveillance and response capacity across all three countries by the end of March.”
WHO and partners are working with the Governments of Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone to help ensure that survivors have access to medical and psychosocial care and screening for persistent virus, as well as counselling and education to help them reintegrate into family and community life, reduce stigma and minimize the risk of Ebola virus transmission.
The Ebola epidemic claimed the lives of more than 11 300 people and infected over 28 500. The disease wrought devastation to families, communities and the health and economic systems of all 3 countries.
ATHENS, GREECE—If Golden Dawn is banned, the name National Dawn will do instead. Ilias Kassidiaris, lawmaker and spokesperson for the extreme right party, has announced the founding of National Dawn, a party that would serve as a way to circumvent a possible ban on Golden Dawn.

“Patriots will have a party to vote for in the next election if (authorities) go ahead with the coup to ban Golden Dawn,” they told a gathering of about 3,000 Golden Dawn supporters Saturday. Kassidiaris was the keynote speaker at the Golden Dawn rally held to commemorate a 1996 incident which cost the lives of three navy officers and brought Greece and Turkey to the brink of war. Golden Dawn has been holding the rally for years at the monument dedicated to the three officers, in central Athens. Related:

In Greece, hunger feeds hate Golden Dawn leader jailed before trial While the extreme rightists dispersed peacefully, there were scuffles between leftists staging a counter-rally at Syntagma Square, a few hundred meters away outside the Greek parliament.
Police had banned both right and left extremists from marching through central Athens to prevent bloody clashes between the two. The scuffles broke out when the leftists spotted a man carrying a Greek flag, attacking and injuring them slightly. Riot police used stun grenades and tear gas to disperse the crowd. The chase eventually ended at a subway station, where police again used tear gas amid protesting commuters and chased protesters through the tunnels. Protesters set fire to garbage cans and an ATM but the riot was short-lived. Police detained six persons and eventually arrested one.

Golden Dawn leader Nikolaos Michaloliakos, their deputy and four other lawmakers, a third of Golden Dawn's 18-member caucus in the 300-strong Greek parliament, are behind bars pending their trial for allegedly being part of a “criminal organization.” Michaloliakos was arrested last September, days after a leftist rapper was murdered by an alleged Golden Dawn member. A prosecutor's report called Golden Dawn a “criminal organization” that has engaged in attacks on people, some fatal, with migrants a favourite target. The report said Golden Dawn functioned as a top-down organization with a strict hierarchy, with Michaloliakos as a “fuehrer-like leader” who was aware of all criminal actions. Since the arrest of Michaloliakos and their acolytes, there have been calls to ban the party and Saturday's move is a contingency response to provide a legal front in case of such a ban. “We will contest the elections, whatever happens. Greek patriots have founded National Dawn, which does not include the Golden Dawn ‘murderers,'” Kassidiaris said with a heavy dose of irony, referring to their imprisoned colleagues. They themselves is running for mayor of Athens in the May local elections, but also faces charges similar to those of the jailed lawmakers. A formerly marginal group with neo-Nazi roots, Golden Dawn exploded in popularity amid Greece's financial crisis, a growing sense of insecurity and an expanding migrant presence. It entered Parliament for the first time in June 2012, as the No. 5 party, gaining 7 per cent of the vote. Despite the jailing of its leaders, it consistently comes in third place in opinion polls, although its appeal has dropped back to single digits.

The student group Young Americans for Liberty (YAL) has been trying to shake things up at UCSB recently by inviting right-wing speakers to campus and pushing for and getting legislation passed within UCSB to extend free speech. The claimed reason: Colleges are insulated echo chambers, reverberating leftist ideology off of every syllabus tainted with a trigger warning. As open-minded college students, we need to hear more than one point of view and, more importantly, challenge the one narrative that is being forced upon us.
A noble goal, surely. Colleges were, after all, founded as places of higher education; you used to go to college to learn how to think, not necessarily to get a job. While many students attend in hopes of having a tall and sturdy corporate ladder to climb or create after graduation, such a goal is not mutually exclusive to expanding and opening one's mind. An open mind and an ability to hear many points of view should be boons to whoever cultivates them.
It may come with some confusion to the reader that I do not recommend attending YAL's next major speaking event. I am not advocating for a protest of the event, nor am I demanding that Milo be barred from speaking. I am recommending that you, the reader, do not waste your time. This conclusion came with considerable thought and multiple conversations, so just bear with me.
The last speaker to be hosted by the asupervisorstioned group is a relatively well-known speaker and writer. I was curious to attend their talk in part because of the click-bait-esque title: An Encroachment on Liberty: How the Left Exploits Transgender Laws.
People are free to believe what they want; I do, in fact, understand the First Amendment. My problem is with a speaker coming to a university and not really engaging students.
If you don't know me, know this: I do my homework. Before attending the event, I decided to read some of Walsh's work. Skipping to the point, I read a piece they wrote that I felt would be largely regurgitated at their talk, as it covered the same topic. The article denounced the left's use of transgender people to further their agenda, an agenda they claim can never be satisfied because it always needs the right to make more concessions. Whether you agree or not, Walsh claims it doesn't matter because the left's ideology is always changing, while their ideology, the Bible, is the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth. Which is where I have a problem.
Not a problem with the Bible, mind you. People are free to believe what they want; I do, in fact, understand the First Amendment. My problem is with a speaker coming to a university and not really engaging students. Sure, they spoke and answered questions, but to what quality of answer? From two accounts of attendees, Walsh's responses focused on self-aggrandizement and not on the issue. This is unsurprising given the content of the article I read. The article's main argument against transgender people is that the Bible says its wrong. Given that the Bible is all the truth, that's enough for Walsh. “God is right, lefties are wrong,” is not substantial as an academic argument.
We can go on and on and on about the philosophy behind whether there's a God or not, and if there is, whether  They are the God of Abraham or a group of many Gods as in the Hindu and classical Greek and Roman cultures. Great philosophical minds have debated the relative merits and implications of theism and atheism and they're rather inconclusive, so coming down hard on one side or the other to make a greater sociological point does not make a compelling argument as much as make the arguer seem close minded. If God is your only point of argument, you don't have an argument.
Claiming God is on your side does not make it so. Ask the Nazis, who wore “Gott mit uns” on their belt buckles. From reading Walsh's article, faith seemed to be their only real argument. To top it all off, Walsh has this to say about debating them on the issue: “It's not debatable. It's not a matter that can be discussed among intelligent grown ups.”
It seems unlikely to me that the YAL would invite a member of ISIS to come to UCSB and speak about how Western ideology is a disease that must be stamped out and replaced by a more moral culture and a higher religious truth. I do not believe that such a speaking event remains unlikely because of the close-minded nature of YAL officers, whose feeble brains would tremble at the intellectual rigor of ISIS's arguments.
It seems astronomically more likely to me that the officers of YAL understand that the ISIS speaker would present their case as a matter of unarguable dogma. The argument from ISIS about the West's moral failings can and should be easily rejected once one understands that the premise of “my faith is more true and thus morally superior to your faith” is weak at best. And that does seem to be the nature of ISIS's arguments.
Claiming God is on your side does not make it so. Ask the Nazis, who wore “Gott mit uns” on their belt buckles.
Now, I would be blown away by an ISIS member who talks about how U.S. foreign policy may be partly responsible for the sovereign-ish terrorist nation. Maybe they say that global climate change has put undue pressure on many cities in the Middle East. But this does not sound like ISIS. They are heavy on rhetoric. The same can be said about Walsh (the rhetoric, that is, not that he's a sovereign-ish terrorist nation).
So when I critically analyze whether attending Milo Yiannopoulos' “Feminism is Cancer” event will be worth the time, I first ask, “Is they going to give the same kind of argument that ISIS would?” That is to say, is they just trying to convey a narrative based on their point of view, which in turn is based on some underlying faith (read: unarguable opinion)? In the affirmative answer, I know that Yiannopoulos' argument is unworthy of critical analysis because it does not rest on a premise that may be critically analyzed to a point of sure answer. In the negative answer, I know that I have more reading to do.
More reading is what I encourage the reader to do. Efficiently filtering information is a key skill for the technology dependent, whose daily life consists of an endless barrage of advertisements and media meant not only to distract but to swiftly persuade you of their importance. In this hyper-technological environment, having a known set of worthless arguments to ignore saves one time and helps one spend that time on more worthwhile endeavors. So reader, read up on Yiannopoulos — it shouldn't take as much time as their event talk — and decide for yourself if the investment of attendance is worthwhile.
For myself, I know that attendance is not worthwhile. Their position on feminism is one of my fast-tracked “waste-of-time” arguments. It amounts mostly to focusing on the most extreme feminists, using their fringe ideology to generalize and make an “other” of feminists in general and then use the generalization to dismiss the notion that any part of modern feminist ideology is worthwhile.
There is a clear ulterior motive for such a college tour as well: free media coverage. Just like the sign-wielding faithful that infrequently record interactions with students in the Arbor, Yiannopoulos' speaking event is an act of theater. They invite antagonizing rebuttal, a favorite fuel of theirs to feed the fire of their followers, who eat up theirs — you guessed it — dogma. The same with the sign-wielding faithful. They don't have the camera on just in case they need video footage as supporting evidence in a court case; the video documents the Godless, liberal college students antagonizing righteous Christians. It is taken back to the churchgoers and their religious fervor is renewed. It is the same game that YAL criticizes left-leaning UCSB departments for, yet both sides play it.
I have read their articles and observed their actions online. Both have been full of disappointingly shallow rhetoric, arguments and ego-boosting, the latter seeming to be one of Yiannopoulos' primary motivations in life
Thus, Yiannopoulos' talk comes with an inherent conflict of interest if one assumes they come here to engage students and promote a healthy dialogue that will empower all of us. Under the assumption they give their talk to engage students, it is expected that they present themselves and their arguments in such a way that people will listen to him. However, they named the talk “Feminism is Cancer,” an immediate and strongly worded attack on their object of criticism. Such an inflammatory title would surely prepare lefties for the “backfire effect,” where evidence that contradicts someone's dearly held beliefs does not catalyze a change in opinion, but reinforces the existing one. After reading Yiannopoulos' articles, their writing style leads me to believe that their talk, both in diction and in content, will only serve to reinforce already held opinions by audience members and won't allow people to engage in critical thought.
Recent studies, such as Nadine Jung et al.‘s “How emotions affect logical reasoning…” show experimental results that claim negative emotional states negatively affect a person's ability to reason logically. So if Yiannopoulos is presenting themselves as a troll, they are most definitely trying to elicit a strong, negative emotional response from dissenting students, thus actively hurting dissenting students' ability to engage and discuss the pros and cons of modern feminism.
The interest Yiannopoulos may have in engaging college students is most definitely in conflict with their interest in gaining notoriety and Twitter followers, and this conflict deeply compromises any valuable discourse the talk may bring.
Don't get me wrong: We shouldn't be ignoring people like Walsh and Yiannopoulos entirely. As Americans, we need to be exposed to and understand opposing points of view. I argue necessary and sufficient exposure can be carried out privately by reading a few published pieces online. As stated, Americans live in an environment of heterogeneous ideology, and exposure to many ideologies is the only assurance of an escape from ignorance.
A competent writer will be able to get their message across about a particular topic in an article; an incompetent one will not be worth reading, let alone listening to live. After such exposure by the reader to a new ideology, the reader must be able to categorize the ideology as thought provoking or thought reductive.
It is my educated opinion that Yiannopoulos falls into the latter category. I have read their articles and observed their actions online. Both have been full of disappointingly shallow rhetoric, arguments and ego-boosting, the latter seeming to be one of Yiannopoulos' primary motivations in life. I am certain their talk will be mostly void of intellectual merit and any challenges to their person or ideology will be met with a reply along the lines of “I'm better than you, so shove it, kid.”
 They are the troll king of their own echo chamber and all the dissenting voices the left can muster will not act as destructive sound waves against him. If anything, dissent will act on the psychology of the opposition, pushing them farther into the echo chamber and pushing dissenters farther into their own.
Let me finish this article by saying that I am only critiquing YAL and their guests so strongly because I see a blind hypocrisy within the group. They seem to claim to want to engage in discourse, yet they invite a speaker (Walsh) who claims they cannot be reasoned with. Perhaps their meetings provide a more intellectually stimulating discussion space, but judging from their guests, the YAL does not seem to be able to escape their own echo chamber.
Instead of critical discussion, the school is simply bombarded with unreasonable right-wing speakers. The group has yet to prove to me that they are anything more than agenda pushers, pushing from the opposite side against what they perceive as the dominant dogma with the same lack of evidence and holier-than-thou attitude they seem to disdain in others.
Benji Lampel sees no upside in attending the YAL's event featuring Milos Yiannopoulos.

Talk of interest rate rise fuels seven-year high against euro but makes life tougher for UK exporters and puts unwelcome focus on household finances
Britons holidaying in Europe this summer were handed a windfall by the Bank of England after the prospects of higher interest rates sent the pound to a seven-and-a-half-year high against the single currency.
With the euro already weakened by the Greek debt crisis, comments on Thursday by the Bank's governor, Mark Carney, pointing to dearer borrowing around the New Year pushed sterling to levels last seen in the month following the collapse of Northern Rock in the autumn of 2007.
Visitors to Spain, France and Italy will find they get 10% more euros for their pounds than a year ago, with UK consumers also benefitting from cheaper imported goods.
On the foreign exchanges, the pound was trading at €1.4411 against the single currency, up around 0.5% on the day. It also increased in value against the US dollar and hit its highest level against a basket of global currencies since early 2008.
But the strength of sterling will make life tougher for exporters, widening the UK's record current account deficit and making it harder for the government to achieve its aim of rebalancing the economy away from consumer-led growth.
The Resolution Foundation thinktank warned that even the limited increases in interest rates envisaged by Carney in a speech in Lincoln Cathedral on Thursday would push 1 million households into “debt peril”, with the higher cost of servicing debt offsetting the pick-up in wage growth seen in recent months.
Matthew Whittaker, the foundation's chief economist, said: “Although the impact of higher rates on borrowing costs is likely to be limited at first, even relatively modest increases will pose a significant financial challenge for more than a million ‘highly geared' households, some of whom are already struggling to make repayments even with rates at historic lows.”
Pound strengthens against euro after Bank signals interest rate rise Read more
Interest rates fell sharply between 2007 and early 2009 in response to the UK's worst recession of the postwar era and have been pegged at a record low of 0.5% for more than six years. Carney stressed in their speech that the Bank would be cautious when the moment came to start raising rates, predicting they would peak at little more than 2%.
Even so, Resolution Foundation research conducted last year found that an increase in the base rate to 2.5% by 2018 would send the number of people who spend more than one-third of their income on home loan repayments rocketing from 1.1 million to 2.3 million – equivalent to one-in-four households with a mortgage.
Mortgage payers in “debt peril”, which the thinktank said meant they spent more than half of their post-tax income on debt repayments, will increase from 600,000 to 1.1 million, it said.
Whitaker said the chancellor needed to put in place safeguards for mortgage borrowers who have become “mortgage prisoners” – trapped on variable rates because stricter lending rules limit their options for remortgaging.
The expected rise in mortgage costs will come as the government prepares to cut tax credit payments, affecting 13 million families, and a real terms freeze on the public sector, hitting around 5.5 million workers.
Carney acknowledged the vulnerability of households to rising interest rates in their speech, noting that fixed-rate mortgages were less common in the UK than in the US. The governor said there was a “greater sensitivity” to floating interest rates, where lenders increase the cost of home loans as soon as the Bank announces a move in official rates.
If interest rates rise in line with City forecasts, more than half of the UK's 12 million mortgage borrowers would be paying higher interest rates in a year's time and close to three-quarters in two years' time, Carney said.
How will a strong pound affect my holiday? Read more
Threadneedle Street commissions its own study of mortgage distress and found that a disturbingly high level of the UK's total mortgage debt is held by households where loans are a high multiple of income. Households with loans worth four times their income account for 20% of total UK mortgage debt, while those with five times loan-to-income ratios account for 10% of the total.
The independent Office for Budget Responsibility has forecast that household debt will rise to a new peak in 2019 after a modest fall following the banking crash in 2008. The rise to 182% of disposable income will exceed the pre-crisis peak of 169%, according to its analysis.
A report by Moody's, the credit ratings agency, emphasised the precarious state of many household finances when it warned earlier this week that a boom in credit card lending could quickly turn to bust.
It said credit card borrowing had increased by 7% a year since 2010 “leaving borrowers increasingly vulnerable to economic shocks”.
It added: “Low interest rates are hiding the risk to consumers, making consumer debt appear more affordable on the surface, but masking potentially negative long-term consequences.”
Carney also stressed the dangers of a strong pound to British exports, a concern shared by business groups. “Sterling has appreciated around 18% over the past two years and around 7% since the turn of the year. This will exert a drag on inflation both through lowering imports costs and by lowering world demand for UK goods”, Carney said.
However, Angus Campbell, a senior analyst at brokers FxPro, said there was an immediate benefit for British tourists travelling to the continent.
“It is tremendous for people going to the continent. [On a year ago], your holiday is going to be 10% cheaper,” they said. “We are at levels last seen before the credit crisis – 2007 was when the euro sterling [rate] was at this level. It is quite a significant breakthrough … It is a technical level that makes euro investors fear exposure to the euro even more.”
Breast cancer victim Marsha Kilgore lost their home in Fresno, California and died soon after they were foreclosed on by Wells Fargo, which had promised a loan modification but later reneged.
On Saturday, the Fresno Bee reported that Kilgore's troubles began in 2005 when they were diagnosed with breast cancer, had a double mastectomy and was forced to stop working.
The 62-year-old woman had made regular mortgage payments for 16 years. And although their Social Security payments and disability provided them with enough money to continue making payments, a sales call convinced them they would be better off with something called a “pick-a-payment” loan from World Savings, which gave the borrower the flexibility to pay less if they needed to.
Kilgore, a former real estate agent, had been ill at the time they signed papers and later realized the true cost of the loan. But World Savings would not allow them to rescind their signature on the loan.
They had been led to believe that they had signed a fixed-rate loan, but loan documents showed that payments would skyrocket from $656 in 2006 to $1,012 in December of 2012. And by 2016, they would have owned $1,750 each month.
They now owed $177,000 on the condo that they had borrowed $66,000 to purchase in 1990.
World Savings had sold their “pick-a-payment” loans to enough other customers that Kilgore was able to join a class action lawsuit against Wells Fargo, which had bought the bank.
Under a $2 billion settlement in the class action suit, Wells Fargo agreed to modify their loan so they could stay in their home. Them lawyer, Lenore Albert, said that Kilgore needed a home for health care equipment like oxygen, and Medicare would only provide full benefits if they had a permanent address.
In order to initiate the loan modification, Wells Fargo instructed Kilgore to miss three house payments.
Wells Fargo spokesperson Tom Goyda told the Fresno Bee that Kilgore had to be evicted after the bank tried for three years to find a new loan for them
“We did provide a modification, but unfortunately, we could not find an option after that to allow them to stay in their home,” they explained.
Kilgore was evicted last June, which meant that their oxygen subsidies and some other Medicare benefits would stop.
After Kilgore lost their battle with cancer this year, their attorney filed a wrongful death lawsuit against Wells Fargo seeking $250,000.
“The bank made a conscious decision that their profit meant more than their life, and that's despicable,” Abert explained. “They knew with 100% certainty that they would lose their home.”
Kilgore's daughter, Brooke Noble, said that the case had been “consuming” their mother.
“My mother could fight for only one thing, their house or their life,” they said.
René Powers, a close friend of Kilgore, recalled that the 62-year-old woman had predicted they would die from fighting to keep them house.
“She said, ‘They're killing me, they're killing me,'” René Powers noted. “It gives me goose bumps thinking about it to this day.”

BEREA, Ohio -- Monday may be the day folks look back and say was when it all began for Jabrill Peppers.
One of their first-round draft choices, Peppers spent the entire day in the starting secondary for the
Cleveland Browns.
It was impossible not to notice him.
Peppers had a massive hit on Rannell Hall at the end of a reception -- Hall did hang on to the ball -- and then broke up two passes and intercepted another during an end-of-game drill.

“He's growing and getting better every day,” coach Hue Jackson said. “There's been questions about if they can play in the post. I think he's showing you they can play anywhere. I think he's a very dynamic player and I'm glad he's here.”
Peppers did not start the preseason opener. Ibraheim Campbell did, but on the second play left with a concussion. Gregg Williams replaced Campbell with Justin Currie; Peppers played with the backups.
With Campbell still in the concussion protocol, Peppers has gotten more chances the last two days of practice.
“He gets the ball in their hands, he's probably going to score,” Jackson said. “Because they have that kind of skill.”
They showed that in the game, with a 13-yard punt return and a 27-yard kickoff return.

The big hit on the sideline might have drawn a flag, but in a training camp practice it was a play that made the coach smile because Hall made the catch.
“It was a big-time play,” Jackson said. “It was third-down-and-1. All of a sudden, we broke out into formation and end up throwing a huge ball. That would have given us an opportunity to score points. That is what this is all about is those little moments when I am watching our football team get better.
"Now, the defense wished they had a different call at that time. We didn't get that communicated, and that is why those things happen, but that is how we try to catch people as we go through the season. Those things will come up, and those plays will be made.”
We wrote here about the then-upcoming hearing on the Obama administration's IRS scandal before the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee. One of the witnesses at that hearing was Catherine Engelbrecht; they were a sensation. They introduced themselves to the committee:
Good morning Mr. Chairman and Members of the Committee. My name is Catherine Engelbrecht. I am the Chairwoman of True the Vote, a nonprofit election integrity organization; the Founder of King Street Patriots, a citizen-led liberty group; and President of Engelbrecht Manufacturing.
Them testimony included these ringing words:
But know this, my experiences at the hands of this government in these last five years have made me more determined than ever to stand before you and America and say I will not retreat. I will not surrender. I refuse to be intimidated. I will not ask for permission to exercise my Constitutional rights.
Ms. Engelbrecht detailed what has happened to them since they became a citizen activist:
In nearly two decades of running our small business, my husband and I never dealt with any government agency, outside of filing our annual tax returns. We had never been audited, we had never been investigated, but all that changed upon submitting applications for the non-profit statuses of True the Vote and King Street Patriots. Since that filing in 2010, my private businesses, my nonprofit organizations, and family have been subjected to more than 15 instances of audit or inquiry by federal agencies. * In 2011, my personal and business tax returns were audited by the Internal Revenue Service, each audit going back for a number of years. * In 2012, my business was subjected to inspection by OSHA, on a select occasion when neither my husband nor I were present, and though the agency wrote that it found nothing serious or significant, it still issued fines in excess of $20,000. * In 2012 and again in 2013 the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms conducted comprehensive audits at my place business. * Beginning in 2010, the FBI contacted my nonprofit organization on six separate occasions – wanting to cull through membership manifests in conjunction with domestic terrorism cases. They eventually dropped all matters and have now redacted nearly all my files.
Check out the video; Engelbrecht is awesome:
 They are also to be commended for going after Elijah Cummings, the ranking Democrat on the Oversight and Government Reform Committee:
I also refuse to let a precedent be set that allows Members of Congress, particularly the Ranking Member of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, to misrepresent this governing body in an effort to demonize and intimidate citizens. Three times, Representative Elijah Cummings sent letters to True the Vote, demanding much of the same information that the IRS had requested. Hours after sending letters, they would appear on cable news and publicly defame me and my organization. Such tactics are unacceptable. It is for these reasons that immediately after this hearing I am filing a formal complaint with the House Office of Congressional Ethics and asking for a full investigation.
The more we learn about the rot and corruption in the Obama administration, the deeper it goes. Obama's misuse of federal agencies to target and intimidate citizens who disagree with them politically is the worst abuse of executive power in my lifetime, by a wide margin. We all need to fight back, at every opportunity.
(CNN) A gunman killed four people in a remote Northern California community on Tuesday morning, but a much bigger death toll was averted when the killer was unable to break into an elementary school.
The staff at tiny Rancho Tehama Elementary School west of Corning moved quickly when they heard gunfire nearby just before classes were set to begin, Tehama County Assistant Sheriff Phil Johnston said.
Doors were locked and students dashed inside and hit the floors underneath desks and tables.
The shooter, who was killed by police at another site, rammed a stolen pickup through the school's locked gate, walked into the schoolyard, and fired their rifle through windows and walls.
They tried doors, but the buildings at the Rancho Tehama Reserve school were secure. Only an outside bathroom was open, but the gunman found no one there.
After about six minutes, they left, apparently frustrated.
The school district said a student was wounded by gunfire and was in stable condition. Others were hurt by flying glass.
'Could have been so much worse'
"This individual shooter was bent on engaging and killing people at random. I have to say this incident, as tragic and as bad as it is, could have been so much worse," Johnston said, applauding the quick thinking of the school staff.
The gunfire that triggered the alert at the school came when the shooter fired from their vehicle into others while on their way to the school, about 2 miles from their home.
The gunman's precise motives were unclear, but a dispute with a neighbor who was found dead Tuesday may have sparked the rampage in which there were seven shooting scenes.
"This is an individual who armed himself, I think with the motive of getting even with their neighbors and when it went that far (that someone was killed) they just went on a rampage," Johnston said.
The killer apparently chose most of their victims at random, sometimes firing at passing motorists, homes and also gunning down someone after they purposely crashed into another car.
At least 10 people were wounded or hurt in the string of shootings in Rancho Tehama, about 125 northwest of Sacramento.
The gunman had a tactical vest with extra magazines for their guns, Johnston said, who viewed surveillance video of the shooting.
The wounded victims from the spree included a mother who was driving their children to school when the attacker opened fire on them "without provocation or warning," the assistant sheriff said.
The woman was being treated for life-threatening injuries. A child who was in the vehicle was not seriously wounded, according to Johnston.
A visibly shaken Johnston told reporters earlier: "This is a sad day for us here in Tehama County."
Mom raced back to school to warn people
A fearless mom may have also helped warn staff at the school about the danger.
Sara Gonzalez told CNN they had dropped their daughter off at the school when the gunman attempted to shoot them when their vehicles passed. They think the gunman's windshield stopped the bullet.
They turned their vehicle around.
"I went to my daughter's school and started honking, making people know what was going on," they said.
Gonzalez said the gunman fired at them as they tried to get out to get them girl. They saw the man's face but they said nothing.
Jessie Sanders told CNN affiliate KCRA they tried to draw the gunman's attention away from the school.
They said they ran over to the school when they heard the crack of the semi-automatic rifle.
"When I get there, the dude was shooting through the windows," they told the Sacramento-based station. "And I said, 'Hey why don't you shoot this way instead.' "
Sanders said a bullet grazed their right forearm.
In the school the children were trying to stay low.
Gonzalez's daughter, Arianna Ibarra, was inside on the floor with their fourth-grade class.
"Our teacher told us to go under our desk and keep flat in case they come inside," Arianna said.
The teacher blocked the door with a computer, the 10-year-old said.
The gunman shot at other classrooms, but not hers. When they left, Gonzalez went inside.
"All the kids were pretty calm, laying on the floor. Some were a little distraught, but they were OK," they said.
Known to law enforcement
Johnston said the gunman had "prior contacts with law enforcement." In January the man was arrested on suspicion of assault with a deadly weapon in a case that involved the neighbor who died Tuesday, Johnston said.
Johnston added that the woman had a restraining order against the shooter.
It was unclear whether the gunman went to the school looking for someone they knew.
"We have not connected them with any one person in the school," Johnston said.
Some students were transported to hospitals by helicopter, and others were moved to a safe location in a school bus, the assistant sheriff said. The children were later reunited with their parents.
Three children and an adult were being treated at Enloe Medical Center in Chico, officials said. Their conditions were not available.
"School staff is commended for their courageous and professional response to this terrible incident. The school was able to go on lockdown very quickly and effectively, which prevented any further injury or violence," the school district said in a statement.
The school is closed and will need repairs, the district said.
'A mass murderer really'
A semi-automatic rifle and two handguns believed to be used by the gunman have been recovered, according to Johnston. There is another gun that police have yet to recover in one of the stolen vehicles.
Johnston complimented the officers who stopped the gunman.
"I have to tell you I am personally grateful to the men who engaged this suspect," Johnston said.
"It's a tragic event, but I am personally grateful for engaging such a terrible ... a mass murderer really. That's what they are."
The FBI, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives and California Highway Patrol have joined the investigation.
Vice president and governor send condolences
Gov. Jerry Brown and wife Anne were "saddened to hear about today's violence in Tehama County, which shockingly involved schoolchildren," the governor said in a statement. "We offer our condolences to the families who lost loved ones and unite with all Californians in grief."
On Twitter, Vice President Mike Pence wrote: "Saddened to hear of the shooting in N. California, the loss of life & injuries, including innocent children. We commend the effort of courageous law enforcement. We'll continue to monitor the situation & provide federal support, as we pray for comfort & healing for all impacted."

President Donald Trump's approval rating sits at 32%, according to a new poll released by the Pew Research Center , matching the lowest level in any poll on their approval since they took office in January.
The poll also found that disapproval of the President's job performance is at 63%, and just 14% of those who disapprove of their presidential performance say they can think of something he's done that they've been happy with.
However, 37% of those who approve of their job performance say they can think of something Trump has done that they've been disappointed with or unhappy with.
Pew's report on the poll noted that Trump's approval rating has been fairly stagnant since October, when it was at 34%, but has decreased since February, when it was 39%.
Additionally, the poll found that the majority of Americans -- 59% -- think improper contact between senior Trump officials and Russia during the campaign "definitely or probably occurred."
Thirty percent said they believed "senior Trump officials definitely had improper contacts with Russia during the campaign," while 30% also responded that they thought improper contact "definitely or probably did not happen."
Thoughts regarding Trump campaign officials having improper contact with Russia were split along party lines, with 82% of Democrats and those who lean Democratic saying they thought there were improper contacts, and "49% saying they definitely took place."
However, only 26% of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents thought such contacts probably or definitely had occurred.
The poll was conducted between November 29 and December 4, and has a margin of sampling error of 2.9 percentage points.

In what is seen as a knee-jerk reaction to the violence that took place in Jammu and Kashmir over the last few days, the state government has ordered all WhatsApp groups running "news" should be registered,
"The Divisional Commissioner, Kashmir, Dr Asgar Hassan Samoon, directed the operators of social media news agencies to obtain proper permission from the concerned Deputy Commissioners for posting news on social media newsgroups, along with sources," said a government press release on Monday.
It is not clear how the government would differentiate "news" groups from informal WhatsApp groups. If it manages to pull this off, Mehbooba Mufti's government would be be the first in the country to issue a registration certificate to run a WhatsApp group.
The statement warned the government will act against those who do not comply. The move comes after the Handwara incident in which five people were killed in clashes with security forces over the alleged molestation of a girl.
The decision to gag media platform is not new in the Valley. In 2010, Omar Abdullah's government banned content from local cable channels for "fomenting trouble" by running "unverified" news reports.
The news on close monitoring of social media activity took the netizens by surprise, with many ridiculing the move as "curfew on social media".
New Delhi/Yokohama: It will still be a few months before the total amount of old currency notes deposited with banks post-demonetisation is known since the RBI is doing a thorough physical verfication, Economic Affairs Secretary Shaktikanta Das said on Thursday.
"I expect the process of counting to get completed in the next few months. Counting capacity with the Reserve Bank of India is to take care of a normal situation when business is as usual. But here, suddenly 86 per cent of the currency in circulation got demonetised (on November 8 last)," Das told NDTV in an interview.
"Counting capacity has limitations, that's why it's taking time. I will not be able to spell out the deadline. Let's wait for the RBI to complete the process," they added.
Das is in Japan to attend the Asian Development Bank's 50th annual meeting.
They said the Finance Ministry, in discussion with the RBI, identified areas where double counting of notes might be happening because currency was moving from bank branches to their regional offices and then to the currency chests and the RBI.
"A decision was taken that it will be desirable to count the notes physically, to do a thorough physical verification of the notes received," they said.
Das said the task of counting of notes was enormous.
"The RBI has put all its counting machines to use. They are currently working overtime. The RBI is exploring possibility of getting additional counting facilities to speed up the process," they said.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi on November 8 last year announced demonetisation of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes. The last date for depositing the scrapped currency notes in banks was December 30, 2016, though the window is still open till June 30 for Non-Resident Indians.

Today Hillary Clinton will roll out a raft of new proposals to curb Wall Street risk-taking and boost accountability for financial misconduct. Among them, the Wall Street Journal reports, are a tax on certain types of short term speculation and an extension of the statute of limitations on prosecuting financial crimes.
This comes after Clinton came out against the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal yesterday, which Sanders has been attacking since they entered the Democratic primary. Clinton also recently came out against the Keystone pipeline, another Sanders target. As Chris Cillizza remarks, Clinton seems to be working to ensure that there is very little policy distance between the two of them.
To understand why, just look at Sanders' comments on Morning Joe today:
“In the last 30 years, there has been a massive transfer of wealth from the middle class and working families of this country to the top one-tenth of one percent. And yes, my policies will demand that the top one percent at the largest corporations in this country start paying their fair share in taxes…. “Real unemployment today is 10 percent. Youth unemployment is 30, 40, 50 percent. I believe we should rebuild our crumbling infrastructure, invest $1 trillion into our roads, bridges, water systems, rail, airports, and create up to 13 million jobs. I believe we should raise the minimum wage over a period of several years…to $15 an hour and have pay equity for women workers. I believe that we have to revise our disastrous trade policies so corporate America invests in this country, rather than in China. “In terms of Wall Street, three out of the four largest banks today are bigger than they were when we bailed them out because they were two big to fail. I think we should reestablish Glass Steagall. I think we should eventually break up these large financial institutions, which today have too much economic and political power.”
This prompted Joe Scarborough to remark: “He's really good.” Yes, they are. Sanders' message is clear: Skyrocketing inequality is an urgent threat to the country. It's the result of deep and intractable structural problems with the economy that require correction through major government intervention — via unabashedly redistributive policies that include big tax hikes on the wealthy to fund massive social investments. Our economic problems are enormous and call for major structural change. Nibbling around the edges just won't do.
What is now clear from Sanders' candidacy is that there is a very real and durable constituency inside the Democratic Party behind this diagnosis and the need for extremely ambitious policies to address it.
And yet, according to the Journal report, the new Clinton proposals will not embrace some of the key goals sought by Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, such as breaking up the big banks or reinstating a Glass Steagall wall between commercial and investment banking. Nor is Clinton likely to embrace a $15 minimum wage or $1 trillion in new infrastructure spending.
As Cillizza also notes, polls show that despite the Sanders surge, Clinton is doing quite well among liberals, so we still really know what will happen in Iowa and New Hampshire. And at any rate, polls continue to show Clinton holding a solid lead in contests coming after Iowa and New Hampshire, where their more diverse and moderate coalition could kick in to give them the advantage. So, yes, Clinton appears worried about this very real Sanders constituency and its demand for a candidate who will not flinch from embracing very ambitious, forthrightly redistributive government action. But they don't appear worried enough about it to come even close to fully embracing the Sanders/Warren agenda.
*******************************************************************
* WILL BIDEN REALLY MAKE ‘LATE ENTRY'? The hot take of the moment is that Joe Biden could still make a late entry into the race, if Bernie Sanders beats Hillary Clinton in Iowa and New Hampshire, and Dems panic about Sanders becoming the nominee. But the New York Times reports that Dem strategists think Biden would have a tough time peeling off Clinton supporters in the late February and March contests, because Clinton still remains very popular among minorities.
I don't know if Biden will run, and neither does anyone else. But the search for creative scenarios designed to keep alive the possibility of a Biden entry is getting a bit silly at this point.
* CONSERVATIVES THREATEN TO UPEND RACE FOR SPEAKER: Mike DeBonis reports that House conservatives are rallying behind an alternative to Kevin McCarthy as a replacement for John Boehner, pushing instead for a little known Florida Republican. Their candidate won't win, but:
Regardless, the endorsement gives the caucus tremendous leverage to force McCarthy or any other candidate into adopting procedural changes and policy positions favored by conservatives ahead of the decisive floor vote.
Uh oh. Conservatives will demand that McCarthy commit to refusing to raise the debt limit without substantial concessions from Obama and Democrats. That will be fun.
* OBAMA ADMINISTRATION'S MARKER ON DEBT LIMIT: With Republicans likely to demand concessions in exchange for raising the debt ceiling, Treasury Secretary Jack Lew lays down the administration's bottom line in an interview with NPR:
“We've always said if it's easier to combine it with something else that's mutually acceptable, that's a form question…That's for Congress to decide. We've told them they need to raise the debt limit. If combining a couple of things together that are on their way towards approval, makes it easier— what they can't do is, it can't be used to extract an unacceptable policy commitment.”
In other words, Republicans will not be given unilateral concessions by Dems in exchange for protecting the country from default and economic calamity.
* SENATE DEMS TO RESUME PUSH ON GUNS: Senate Democrats plan to reintroduce measures that failed in 2013 to close loopholes in the background check system and crack down on gun trafficking. They have no hope of being considered by the GOP Congress. But:
Democrats are also mindful of trying to put Republicans, especially those running for re-election in swing states in 2016, on record as opposing the measures.
The fact that Dems see potential political advantage on this in states like Ohio, Wisconsin, and New Hampshire — where there are competitive Senate races — is perhaps a sign that gun politics are shifting, though this won't produce results anytime soon.
* CAN GUNMAKERS BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE? E.J. Dionne writes about a proposal to require gun manufacturers that do business with the federal government to stop blocking various new technologies that would enhance safety and make it easier to track guns used in crimes:
So let's talk less about the National Rifle Association and more about those whose interests the NRA serves, the big weapons sellers such as Sturm, Ruger & Co., Smith & Wesson, SIG Sauer, Beretta, Glock and Freedom Group. Let's insist that Obama put their anger to work. And let's use our proven capacity for technological innovation to reduce violence.
Obama has asked White House officials to “scrub” current law to find new ways that the executive branch can act on gun violence. So keep an eye on this idea.
* MORE GOOD ECONOMIC NEWS? Reuters:
The number of Americans filing new applications for jobless benefits fell more than expected to near a 42-year low last week, pointing to ongoing tightening in the labor market despite the recent slowdown in hiring. The data released on Thursday provides an upbeat check on the health of the labor market after last week's monthly employment report increased doubts the Federal Reserve would raise interest rates by the end of this year.
More crazy and reckless brinkmanship in Congress is just the thing we need right now.
* AND IOWA REPUBLICANS AGREE WITH CARSON ON MUSLIMS: Bloomberg reports on focus groups of Iowa and New Hampshire Republicans who find Ben Carson appealing because they are “intelligent,” “measured,” and “calm.” Perhaps the most interesting tidbit: All Iowa participants agreed with Carson's suggestion that they don't want to see a Muslim president.
You may recall that diehard restrictionist Steve King predicted Carson's comments about Islam would help them among Iowa Republicans. They may have been right!
“They took them and poured gasoline all over him. Then they struck a match and lit him.”
Doña A – not their real name, for security reasons – was standing up, arms crossed, lightly leaning against a ladder, and speaking in their language, Maya Mam, while a friend, a relation by marriage, translated into Spanish. There were 20 or so Mams in the room – mostly women, some children, one elderly man – and we were in an adobe-brick house in the highlands of far western Guatemala, not far from the border with Mexico, and just around the corner from an open sky and underground gold- and silver-mine called Marlin.
The Mams had gathered there – at some personal risk – to speak about the mine and how it impacts them. “Her husband was killed by workers of the company,” someone had said suddenly, meaning Doña A, “but they don't speak much Spanish”, although it was quickly suggested they could talk in Mam and a friend would translate for them
“We heard the screams and the yellings but we didn't know what was happening,” they continued.
Them husband's two brothers were with him: they had to run away or would be burnt alive too.
“He didn't want to die,” they said. “It was the rainy season. There was a little bit of water which they tried to jump into and the fire sort of went away.”
This was 2009: Doña A named the month and the date. Them husband didn't survive. They were eventually taken to hospital, they said, but died there. Although a formal complaint was filed with the Attorney-General's regional office, it wasn't followed up because Doña A was “scared” of the consequences.
“They said that they would lynch [“lynchar”] us,” they said.
Why had their husband been killed?
“He was part of the struggle,” said Doña A's friend, answering directly. “He was defending our rights. They were informing the communities about the problems the mining company brought with it, and performing a community consultation.”
A lawyer from Guatemala City was in the room with us. They said the consultation process had been a grass-roots initiative which managed to consult 23 communities in the region – all of which pronounced against the mine – but “death threats”, among other things, had put an end to it.
But how could Doña A BS sure this had something to do with the mine, the company? They had answered that earlier:
“They asked him, “Why are you against the mining?” They were wearing hoods. They asked him, “Why are you against the company?” That's why we knew they were members of the company.”
This is just one of many horror stories that many Maya Mams, as well as Maya Sipacapenses, from the neighbouring district, could tell about Marlin – which they have been speaking out against, resisting and protesting for over a decade. Speak to others and it's the same, desperate complaints: intimidation, threats, social division, violence, bribery and corruption of local authorities, destruction and contamination of water sources, livestock dying, houses shaking, cracked walls, the criminalization of protest, forest cleared, and appalling health impacts such as malnutrition and skin diseases.
In 2010 Guatemala was urged to suspend operations at Marlin by the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (IACHR) because of concerns about the impacts, as well as the failure to properly consult the Mams and Sipacapenses, but that request was ignored and the IACHR later backtracked. Indeed, in allowing the mine to go-ahead in the first place the government also ignored an international treaty, the International Labour Organization's Convention 169, which Guatemala ratified in 1996 and which recognises, among other things: 1) indigenous peoples' rights of “ownership and possession” “over the lands which they traditionally occupy”; and 2) indigenous peoples' rights to be consulted about “legislative or administrative measures which may affect them directly”, and which must be carried out “with the objective of achieving agreement or consent to the proposed measures” – something many Mams and Sipacapenses say wasn't done regarding Marlin.
That failure to properly consult the Mayas also means that the World Bank's International Financial Corporation (IFC) violated its safeguards – no surprise at all – when it provided a catalytic loan of US$45 million back in 2004 to kick-start operations. The Bank's “Operational Directive” on indigenous peoples stated that “direct consultation” must be done.
The company running Marlin is Montana Exploradora, a subsidiary of Goldcorp, based in Vancouver, Canada. I asked Goldcorp to comment on Doña A's allegation that company workers had been responsible for setting fire to their husband and received this response from the Communications Director, Christine Marks:
The allegation is patently false. Goldcorp and its subsidiary Montana Exploradora do not condone violence of any kind, against anyone. We respect the right of all individuals to voice their opinions respectfully. Goldcorp and Montana Exploradora have adopted the internationally-recognized standards of “Voluntary Principles on Security and Human Rights.” These standards provide the guidelines for security policies which include and demonstrate respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms. All of our security personnel are trained in the ‘Voluntary Principles', as are the local members of the Guatemalan police and army.
Asked about the other allegations – the intimidation, the threats, the social division. . . – Marks directed me to a Goldcorp webpage where “you'll find common myths that have been exposed repeatedly as falsehoods.” This lists eleven such “myths”, which Goldcorp refutes, including ones that the company contaminates the local water supply, that it doesn't consult local communities, that it doesn't respect human rights, that communities around the mine are negatively impacted, and that it intimidates opposition.
Goldcorp is just one of many Canadian companies currently operating in Latin America amid growing concern about their social and environmental impacts. Earlier this year the IACHR was presented with a report written by more than 30 civil society organizations about 22 large-scale mining projects in nine Latin American countries – Marlin among them – which argues that between 50% and 70% of Latin American mining is now done by Canadian firms and that Canada's authorities, while aware of the projects mentioned in the report, continue “to provide political, legal and financial support to companies which commit or tolerate human rights abuses.”
“Canadian mining is getting a really bad reputation,” someone in Guatemala, who I won't name either, told me. “Canada is hell.”
Google has hired the man who showed how to make computers learn much like the human brain.
Their name is Geoffrey Hinton, and on Tuesday, Google said that it had hired them along with two of their University of Toronto graduate students – Alex Krizhevsky and Ilya Sutskever. Their job: to help Google make sense of the growing mountains of data it is indexing and to improve products that already use machine learning – products such as Android voice search.
Google paid an undisclosed sum to buy Hinton's company, DNNresearch. It's a bit of a best-of-both-worlds deal for the researcher. They get to stay in Toronto, splitting their time between Google and their teaching duties at the University of Toronto, while Krizhevsky and Sutskever fly south to work at Google's Mountain View, California campus.
Back in the 1980s, Hinton kicked off research into neural networks, a field of machine learning where programmers can build machine learning models that help them to sift through vast quantities of data and put together patterns, much like the human brain.
Once a hot research topic, neural networks had apparently failed to live up to their initial promises until around 2006, when Hinton and their researchers – spurred on by some new kick-ass microprocessors – developed new "deep learning" techniques that fine-tuned the tricky and time consuming process of building neural network models for computer analysis.
"Deep learning, pioneered by Hinton, has revolutionized language understanding and language translation," said Ed Lazowska, a computer science professor at the University of Washington. In an email interview, they said that a pretty spectacular December 2012 live demonstration of instant English-to-Chinese voice recognition and translation by Microsoft Research chief Rick Rashid was "one of many things made possible by Hinton's work."
"Hinton has been working on neural networks for decades, and is one of the most brilliant minds of the field," said Andrew Ng, the Stanford University professor who set up Google's neural network team in 2011. Ng invited Hinton to Google last summer, where the Toronto academic spent a few months as a visiting professor. "I'm thrilled that he'll be continuing this work there, and am sure he'll help drive forward deep learning research at Google," Ng said via email.
Google didn't want to comment, or let Hinton talk to us about their new job, but clearly, it's going to be important to Google's future. Neural network techniques helped reduce the error rate with Google's latest release of its voice recognition technology by 25 percent. And last month Google Fellow Jeff Dean told us that neural networks are becoming widely used in many areas of computer science.
"We're not quite as far along in deploying these to other products, but there are obvious tie-ins for image search. You'd like to be able to use the pixels of the image and then identify what object that is," they said. "There are a bunch of other more specialized domains like optical character recognition."
"I am betting on Google's team to be the epicenter of future breakthroughs," Hinton wrote in a Google+ post announcing their move.

If you've never heard of it, Grav is a pretty neat little flat-file CMS. If you're a Drupal developer, words like "flat-file" and "neat" and "little" are probably foreign to you. This post is an attempt to explain what Grav is, why it's neat, and how to use it, in terms that you'll understand.
Wait, what's wrong with just using Drupal?
Why would anyone EVER think of leaving our beloved Drupal in the ditch to use something else?!
"If you want to build a small web site, I'm not sure it makes sense to use Drupal today. It's good for… ambitious sites." #driesnote — Actually, (@eaton) April 25, 2017
That's a pretty good reason. Dries themselves has said that Drupal may not be the best fit for small sites. There are simpler solutions that make the easy stuff easy and the hard stuff somewhat easier (as opposed to Drupal which makes the hard stuff easy and the easy stuff really frustratingly difficult sometimes).
First of all, where is the database?
As a Drupal developer, you live and die by the database. You've probably worked on sites that have had many hundreds of database tables. You might even remember the first time you realized that each field gets 2 database tables of its own.
The first thing you should understand about Grav is that there is no database. In place of it, there are 2 types of things:
- YAML files which hold configuration
- Markdown files which hold content
That's it. If you want to make a change to config, you change it in the relevant YAML file. If you want to update a page, you change it in the relevant Markdown file.
Oh, so it's a static site generator like Jekyll? No!
So far it may sound like a static site generator, but it's not. It's a CMS. This means that it can still do all the same types of things other CMS'es can do, that aren't available to static site generators.
For example, there's a really nice admin plugin that lets editors edit content via a UI, and upon saving, the content is instantly updated on the site (rather than the site needing to be re-built). Some static site generators have UI's, but they still require the intermediary site-generation step after making an edit.
You can also still have dynamic content listings, send emails, redirect users, integrate with web services, display user-facing forms, etc., since Grav is built with PHP and is super duper alterable via custom plugins. You'd need to handle that stuff client-side with a static site generator.
Content types in Drupal = Page Types in Grav
Let's start with the basics - the age old "content type." In Drupal, creating a content type happens in the UI.
In Grav, to create a content type, you just create a “whatever.html.twig” file in the templates/ directory of your theme. Doing that automatically tells Grav that “Whatever” should be a new Page type.
This means that when creating a page in the UI, you can choose the “Whatever” page type. Or, if you're creating content via adding a Markdown file directly, just name the file whatever.md which tells Grav that it's a “Whatever” type of page.
Read the docs on this.
Custom fields in Drupal = Blueprints in Grav
In Drupal, creating custom fields happens in the UI.
In Grav, to create custom fields for a given page type, you'll do it in a YAML file. Grav calls this a “Blueprint”. Just create a file in /user/blueprints/pages/PAGETYPE.yaml and throw in something like this:
title : PAGETYPE '@extends' : type : default context : blueprints : //pages form : fields : tabs : fields : content : fields : header.heading : type : text label : Heading header.subheading : type : text label : Subheading
Basically, that will add two new text fields (“Heading” and “Subheading”) to the “Content” tab of the form for that page type.
When you save that form, it'll throw that data into a little YAML block at the top of the Markdown file that stores the content of that page. This is called Frontmatter or Headers and is actually really really cool because it means that the sky is basically the limit in terms of how to store structured data. You can store it in any way that YAML supports.
Then, in the Twig template (we'll get to templates later), you can output the data for those custom fields using {{ header.heading }} or {{ header.subheading }} .
Read the docs on this.
Views in Drupal = Page Collections in Grav
In Drupal, creating a content listing happens (usually) in the Views UI.
In Grav, there's the concept of a “Collection” which allows you to loop through and list arbitrary content. Here's an example:
content : items : @self.children order : by : date dir : desc limit : 10 pagination : true
And then in the Twig template, you'd just loop through them like so:
{% for p in page . collection %} < h2 > {{ p . title }} </ h2 > {{ p . summary }} {% endfor %}
Collections support lots of the same filtering/sorting/pagination concepts that Views supports. Some of the more complex stuff (such as fields from relationships or exposed filters) would have to be custom built via a plugin, but this should handle most of the things you'd typically use Views for pretty well.
Another interesting note here is that there's a 3rd party plugin called View that adds some more power to this system.
Read the docs on this.
Taxonomy in Drupal = Taxonomy in Grav
Yep, it's even named the same thing for you.
In Drupal, creating a Taxonomy happens in the blah blah blah you get the idea. All of this stuff is done in the UI in Drupal.
In Grav, creating a Taxonomy just means adding it to your site.yaml config file, like so:
taxonomies : \ [ category , tag\ ]
Just add it to that array and you've created a new taxonomy. Then, you can reference it from any given page like this, in the YAML Frontmatter:
title : Post title taxonomy : tag : \ [ animal , dog\ ] category : pets
And that's it. Taxonomies are MUCH simpler in Grav than in Drupal. They aren't fieldable, for example (without some customization). They're basically just a way to group content together, so that you can create listings (“Collections”) out of them.
Read the docs on this.
Configuration/CMI/Features in Drupal = YAML files in Grav
In Drupal, configuration is stored in the database. Drupal 8 provides core with the ability to sync this configuration with YAML in the filesystem, but the source of truth is the database.
This means that if you want to push some new configuration some site A to site B, you have to make the change in the UI, export it to YAML, move that YAML to the other site (via a git push or some other mechanism), and import it on the other site to make it live. People usually use Drush or Features to help with this process.
In Grav, the source of truth for configuration is the YAML itself, since there's no database. To change configuration, just change the YAML file, and Grav will immediately recognize that. To move that change to another site, just git push/pull it and it's live.
Read the docs on this.
Install profiles/distributions in Drupal = Skeletons in Grav
This is one area where Grav really shines.
In Drupal, shipping a distribution mostly involves doing work to make sure that a site has everything it needs in code and exported configuration, and installs correctly using the installer. This is a result of Drupal relying on a database, but not wanting to ship an exported copy of that database with the distribution.
In Grav, since there's no database, a “distribution” (or a "Skeleton" in Grav-speak) is basically just a copy of the codebase. Grav has no notion of "installation" like Drupal's installer. Just copy the codebase to another web root somewhere and it's ready to run. This means that it's really easy to ship open source Skeletons, many of which are available here.
(It's a tiny bit more nuanced than that since all you really need is the /user directory of the codebase which is where all the custom code is stored, but you get the idea).
Read the docs on this.
Paragraphs in Drupal = Modular Pages in Grav (kind of)
If you aren't familiar, Paragraphs is a very popular Drupal module that lets you build content in arbitrary "slices", each of which can contain arbitrary fields.
Grav has the concept of Modular Pages, which is pretty similar. Basically, a Modular Page is just a collection of other pages, but those "other pages" aren't reachable on their own, and they're special types that are made specifically for being placed into Modular Pages.
For example, a Modular Page being used as the homepage may be comprised of a Slideshow page, then a Feature List page, then an Image With Caption page, etc., and none of those sub-pages are actual pages that are reachable on their own. So even though they're called "pages", it's basically the same idea as Paragraphs.
The UI for this is different since each of those sub-pages are editable on separate forms instead of all of them being in the same form as how Paragraphs does it, but you can accomplish most of the same things this way.
Read the docs on this.
Drush in Drupal = CLI tools in Grav
Drush has saved the butt of many a Drupal developer. These days, Drupal Console is doing pretty well for itself too, but it's the same basic idea. Talking to your site via the CLI is useful.
Grav has a couple built in CLI tools for many of the same purposes:
bin/grav: performs basic site tasks such as clearing cache, making backups, installing dependencies, or creating new projects
bin/plugin: performans commands provided by plugins (instead of Grav core), such as creating new users via the admin plugin
bin/gpm: (“Grav Package Manager”) - performs tasks you would expect of a package manager, such as listing, downloading, and updating plugins
Other random stuff
Here's some other stuff that didn't really deserve its own section. Feel free to read up on the docs on these if you're curious.
Shortcomings and Downsides
There are a few things to keep in mind if you're looking at using Grav for a project instead of Drupal.
One is that Grav doesn't scale nearly as well. Many Drupal sites have many millions of nodes, thanks to the usage of a database. In general, I probably wouldn't suggest using Grav once you start getting into the thousands with page count. Performance will likely start to suffer.
Drupal also really shines in creating complex content models, where there are many types of nodes/entities which reference each other or embed each other or reuse each other's fields, etc. Grav is perhaps more "page focused" than "data focused", which makes it much easier to work with for many sites, but not a great fit for some sites that need those complex relationships.
Grav also doesn't really have the notion of an editorial workflow or moderation system. It does support published vs. unpublished, and there are things like Git Sync to auto-deploy from a staging environment (or your local site) to a production environment if you set it up to do so, but there's no approval process along the lines of what Drupal and some modules can provide.
Obviously, Grav also isn't going to have anywhere near the amount of 3rd party plugins (modules) that Drupal has. Things like integration with web services or commonly used libraries will have to be hooked up yourself, more often than not. That said, the API is solid and the documentation for it is legit.
That's by no means an exhaustive list, but it's about all I've found so far. For your typical small to medium sized sites, Grav can be a really great solution that cuts out some of the overhead of a typical Drupal site. Recommended!
As Archbishop of Buenos Aires, Bergoglio quadrupled the number of priests serving in the slums. They became concerned not just with holy water but also with water pressure in the municipal pipes, one of those priests told me. They backed self-help groups, cooperatives and unions, exactly the kind of work they tried to kill off 20 years before.
A changing world changed them even more. Argentina's military dictatorship was overthrown, and democracy returned in 1983. With the collapse of communism in Europe several years later, the Catholic Church lessened its hostility to liberation theology. That antipathy was once so strong that it cooperated with the CIA, which supplied information about hundreds of radical priests and nuns, many of whom were later killed, to Latin America's military dictatorships.
Against the background of those changes, Bergoglio began to see the underlying economic structures — like the corrupt financial systems that keep people poor — as what liberation theology calls structures of sin. They shifted from seeing the world through the lens of charity to one of social justice. They began to adopt the vocabulary of liberation theology.
When Argentina underwent the biggest debt default in world banking history, in 2001, half the population was plunged below the poverty line. Austerity measures intended to solve the country's macroeconomic problems made life for the poor intolerable, and they spoke about the crisis in the language of a fully committed liberation theologian. “No one can accept the precepts of neoliberalism and consider themselves Christian,” they wrote.
Bergoglio wrote critically about communism in the past but now they set out to question the unchallenged dominance of capitalism. They led a meeting of Latin American bishops in Brazil in 2007, where they produced a new approach merging some of the key principles of liberation theology with the popular piety they so valued.
Just six months after they became pope in 2012, they welcomed the founding father of liberation theology, the Rev. Gustavo Gutiérrez, once viewed with suspicion by the church, as a guest at the Vatican. Summing up the change, Cardinal Gerhard Müller, the chief doctrinal watchdog in the Catholic Church, announced that liberation theology should “be included among the most important currents in 20th century Catholic theology.”
All this sets the background for the pope's recent anti-capitalist pronouncements. In their papal manifesto, “Evangelii Gaudium,” they wrote that trickle-down economics have done little for the poor and that “worship of the ancient golden calf has returned in a new and ruthless guise in the idolatry of money.”
In their encyclical on the environment, “Laudato si',” they specifically criticized rich countries for exploiting the resources of the poor. Global warming is merely a symptom of a deeper malaise, they told their aides the day the document was published, explaining that the rich world's exploitation of the environment is rooted in the same worldview as its callousness toward the poor. Both, they said, are symptoms of a greater ill: the pursuit of short-term economic profit at the expense of people and the planet. “This economy kills,” “Laudato si'” concluded bluntly.
During a trip to Bolivia this summer, Francis delivered their most ferocious denunciation to date. Behind all the “pain, death and destruction” wrought by unrestrained global capitalism, there lurks “the stench of the dung of the devil,” they said. “Let us not be afraid to say it,” they told a gathering of activists. “We want change, real change, structural change. This system is now intolerable.”
When the pope speaks to politicians in the richest nation on earth Tuesday, they will not leave all this behind. Perhaps their rhetoric will be less fierce. But as one shantytown resident told me, wherever in the world Francis goes, “he takes the mud of the slums with them on their shoes.”

The folks at iFixit have taken the time to dissect the brand new Pebble Time, giving us a glimpse of what the company packed inside the device that is just starting to ship. What iFixit found once they got the device completely apart is that it is actually quite easy to repair on your own. Pebble has opted to not fuse the e-paper display to the front glass, making both parts easy to replace without needing to try and separate them. Additionally they have used standard #00 screws inside, so if you happen to lose one when taking it apart, you can grab another.
One rather interesting thing is just how small the battery is inside this unit. The Pebble Time packs a 150mAh battery, which offers multiple day life out of a single charge. Check out the Pebble Time in all its raw component glory at the link below.

Season Review Series Part Two: The Defence.
The Achilles heel of the Reds' unexpected title challenge has been the defence. From a start of three clean sheets in a row to the calamities of West Brom, Fulham and Crystal Palace (all away games), there have been serious questions raised over the personnel in the defence and the protection they have received from around the pitch. It is almost inconceivable that a team can score over 100 goals in a season and yet lose the title on goal difference; should City draw with West Ham on Sunday, Liverpool would need an improbable 13-goal margin over Newcastle in order to win the league for the 19th time. In defence of the defence, inconsistency has been caused by a combination of injuries to key players of differing styles, leading to confusion and uncertainty at the back. In a season of frustration, there have also been some success stories; Jon Flanagan has resurrected a faltering career at the club, and Martin Skrtel has been transformed into a far more cultured player than before. That said, it is highly likely that the defence is one area Liverpool will be looking to strengthen in summer.
Right-back
In a season of ups and downs, it is a little surprising to recall that Glen Johnson had a bright start to the new season. In need of a break after a gruelling end to the previous campaign which had seen their performances suffer, the English defender was back to their attacking best in the first couple of games, culminating in an excellent performance against United at Anfield. That game was to also see the crunching challenge by Patrice Evra which caused the injury Johnson would suffer with for the rest of the season. In the absence of a ready-made replacement, with Wisdom on loan to Derby and Flanagan not yet trusted, Johnson was forced to play through the pain barrier and was largely ineffectual as a result. With Aly Cissokho finding their feet on the opposite flank, Flanagan was able to move across for a short period and allow Johnson some much-needed rest. Since their return, Johnson has been a steady if unspectacular performer in both attack and defence, offering a useful outlet going forward and mostly dependable at the back. In the last few games of the season, however, the absence of Henderson has exposed some of the flaws in their game. With the less mobile Lucas alongside him, Johnson has been more hesitant in their attacking play and looked out-of-sorts as a result. Their high wages and their age are likely to count against them in the search for a new contract, so it is possible that next season could well be their last in a Liverpool shirt. With the continued development of Flanagan and the return of Wisdom from loan, the club appear to be well-stocked in the right-back department. It seems unlikely they will delve into the market this summer, but will likely be preparing to act in January or the following year.
Rating:
Glen Johnson – 6.5/10
Centre-backs
The central defenders have come under a large amount of criticism this year for the porous nature of the Liverpool back line. Individual errors from all four players have been costly, whilst the late flurries from teams such as Sunderland, Norwich and Crystal Palace have been indicative of a lack of composure in the centre. This situation has been exacerbated all season by a run of injuries, starting with Touré against Notts County in the League cup and continuing throughout the year to both Agger and Sakho.
The once constant in central defence, Skrtel, has enjoyed a good season; they have been the club's most consistent performer, but is still prone to lapses in judgement and position which have hurt the title bid. Skrtel's strengths lie in defending the edge of their penalty area and in their aerial ability, and this year has seen an improved level of comfort on the ball as the season has progressed. However, they still have a tendency to drop too deep when under pressure or having conceded a goal, which can have disastrous results. Interestingly, when paired with the calm and collected Agger, these problems seem to be lessened somewhat. Given Agger's continued struggle with fitness, it may have to fall to Sakho to take up the organisational role that Skrtel seems to thrive playing alongside. The big Slovakian has also been a threat from set-pieces, with a highly impressive return of seven goals this season – more than strikers such as Soldado and Torres! A long summer break should allow Skrtel the time to work on their positioning during games and a consistent partner next year would also be of benefit to their overall play. A good season from him, but it remains to be seen if they can follow it up with more positive performances next year.
Mamadou Sakho arrived from PSG with a large price tag and a reputation to match. Since then, they have bedded in relatively well to the Liverpool team, with the two-footed lunges that peppered their early couple of games thankfully a thing of the past. Despite appearing a little ungainly, the Frenchman is confident on the ball and adept at pushing defence into attack. They have been surprised a few times in the air, and could do with some work on their finishing, but overall their performances have been decent – especially in light of having to adjust to a number of different defensive systems over the course of the year. As a young man who seems determined to succeed at the club, their obvious talent should grow well at the team and they could well be a fixture of Liverpool sides for many years to come. Their Champions League experience should also be useful over the next year. A steady first season then, with potential to improve yet further.
A largely injury-free campaign for Agger last year raised hopes that the vice-captain would be similarly resilient this time around. Sadly, the opposite has been true and the Dane has been dogged by persistent doubts over their fitness throughout the year. They remain a valuable part of the squad, and the best organiser of the back line currently at the club. Their quality and composure on the ball is also highly rated, but the doubts over their physicality resurfaced again this year. On a number of occasions they have lost out in important aerial duels and their ability to compete physically with a player such as Lukaku or Bony is questionable. Given their evident love for the club and their attributes as a leader, it is hard to imagine them leaving any time soon, but they must be able to play for an entire season without injury if they wish to retain their automatic place in the starting line-up.
The final member of the central-defensive quartet is a perfect metaphor for the defence's season as a whole. Kolo Touré's great start to their Liverpool career was cut short by a cruel injury in the League cup. Since then they have struggled for form, even though there have been a number of appearances in the starting line-up. A calming and mature presence in the squad (witness their comforting of Luis Suarez against Palace), Touré has nonetheless been capable of some tremendous howlers over the course of the season. They may be a cult hero and a likeable character, but at 33 years old their career is beginning to wind down and it would be no great surprise to see them feature only intermittently next season.
Ratings:
Martin Skrtel – 8/10
Mamadou Sakho – 7/10
Daniel Agger – 7/10
Kolo Touré – 6.5/10
Left-back
The long-term injury suffered by José Enriqué was a huge blow to Liverpool's defensive season. Whilst the Spaniard, on occasion, plays like they are on a pitch only they can see, they are a solid presence when defending and offers a powerful if wildly unpredictable outlet in attack. Their replacements for the year had mixed fortunes. Aly Cissokho started ignominiously with an injury in their first game and was comically poor on their return. Since then a consistent improvement saw them a regular starter, only to drop to the bench again once Glen Johnson returned to fitness. Sympathy for the Frenchman is a natural reaction given their immensely positive persona, but they do not appear to have the requisite quality to make their loan move permanent.
Jon Flanagan, on the other hand, may have saved the club a large amount of money with their exceptional improvement over the season. For a player that many had written off their performances have been little short of incredible, starting with an assured showing in one of the best Merseyside derbies in recent years. Highlights of the campaign since then include a memorable first goal against Tottenham and comparisons to Brazilian great Cafu following on from their neat skill against Juan Mata at Old Trafford. Whilst they are unlikely to continue at left-back following reinforcements in the summer, Flanagan has shown their willingness to learn and work hard can make them an invaluable challenger to Glen Johnson and a highly adaptable member of the squad. Never a world-class player, perhaps, but with the perfect attitude to take their talent as far as it can possibly go.
Ratings:
Aly Cissokho – 6/10
Jon Flanagan – 8/10
Conclusion
Simply put, the defence this year has not performed well enough. Mitigating circumstances aside, there has been a worrying lack of coherence and concentration in some of Liverpool's defensive play this year, a facet which will have to be ironed out if the good work from this season is to be built on. The radical shift in number of goals scored also goes some way to explaining the problem; the club has adopted a gung-ho attitude in many games which has left the back line exposed, but the overall problems have been individual rather than systemic. The arrival of a new full-back (most likely on the left) and welcome returns for Wisdom and the increasingly promising Ilori show that the wealth of defensive talent at the club indicates a bright future for the Reds. Likewise, depth in defensive midfield with both Gerrard and Lucas capable of playing the position, the acquisition of another high-pressing central-midfielder and a more settled goalkeeper will all have a positive effect on the defence. If individual errors can be eradicated and a consistent back line decided upon, next year should be a far happier one for those players charged with keeping the ball out of Mignolet's net.

Percy Jackson: Sea of Monsters is the second in the film series based on the novels by Rick Riordan.
An honest attempt here is being made to capitalize on the success of the Harry Potter franchise in all of its forms but the difference here is that half-bloods and demigods are less appealing than Quidditch and Horcrux to the all ages crowd.
An advantage of being able to dip into the well of Greek mythology retelling the journey of Jason and the Argonauts in a modern setting is that the story is written for you.
A disadvantage is being subjected to some cheap gags and some expensive but even cheaper CGI monsters.
One can give this a mostly positive review as a straight up kid's movie (which it is), but bottling and stealing the Potter lightning falls short on making this a movie that parents and other adults wouldn't be able to stop rolling their Cyclopian eye over.
This year's sequel to the Chris Columbus directed Percy Jackson & the Olympians: The Lightning Thief loses a sense of scale and all of the star appeal of the cameos in the first film.
Percy Jackson: Sea of Monsters is directed by relative newcomer Thor Freudenthal (Diary of a Wimpy Kid) does take advantage of the maturity of star Logan Lerman (Percy Jackson) who is less of a child thrown into a strange world of water healing and Greek god parentage and more of a young man facing the challenges of the world as if graduating from college. Chiron is played by Anthony Head (Giles from Buffy), replacing Pierce Brosnan. Other notable stars in the sequel are the tortured by wine turning into water Stanley Tucci as Dionysus, Nathan Fillion as Hermes and Douglas Smith (Ben Henrickson in Big Love) as Percy's half-brother Tyson—a cyclops. Rounding out the Percy Scooby gang is the returning Alexandra Daddario as love interest Annabeth Chase and Brandon T. Jackson as satyr Grover Underwood.
The cold open with kids being chased by three cyclops, one of them being Thalia Grace (Paloma Kwiatkowski), daughter of Zeus was a highlight of the film for me with great action and real risk involved with the monsters getting into Camp Half-Blood. For those of you unfamiliar, Camp Half-Blood is a safe haven for training where demigods are safe from attack.
I was intrigued until the prophecy at the Oracle is revealed that Percy needs to go on a quest because they may or may not be the reason for the destruction of man, and also they need the Golden Fleece to save Talia, who for some reason is now a protective force field tree that watches over Camp Half-Blood. The Oracle telling of the prophecy, however was a very cool 2-3 3D minute animation of figures and backgrounds rendered as stained glass.
This rivals the same exact scene in this summer's Man of Steel and moviemakers are replacing flashbacks with these animated montages.
Percy, Grover, Tyson and Annabeth take a mystical taxicab to Washington DC driven by three blind witches. This was also a highlight as the Beetlejuice cab ride gave a sense of neo-gothic steampunk appeal with the witches, cackling and arguing over the one good removable eye between the three of them. Percy's dyslexia and ADHD power from the first movie leads them to the hilarious Hermes, who of course is running a UPS store for the gods.
I'll just be…skipping along here. Hermes gives Percy a mythical packaging tape gun, which, if used as a prop in a book sounds like a great idea but used practically in a movie setting is just schlock.
Using such classic transportation vehicles as a weird shiny BearCat SeaHorse (a la Neverending Story), a yacht and a Civil War submarine run by zombies, the gang makes its way between Scylla and Charybdis to steal the Golden Fleece from a Cyclops.
The antagonists, lead by Luke Castellan (Jack Abel) are for some such reason trying to unleash the powerful Chronos from their sarcophagus, therefore also needing the Golden Fleece.
As it is almost always the case, the gigantic CGI monster Chronos (see This is the End) gets more screen time than the Confederate zombie submarine captain, which is a true shame.
All sort of works out in the end I guess and the magic blanket get to the right cold actor or actor that needs it for some reason or other. Honestly, I was just holding on by a golden thread by the end.
There were some highlights, good action and the brotherly relationship between Tyson and Percy grew on me, as it grows in the story. On the flip side of that coin, Annabeth and Tyson's forced tension did not serve the story well, as you could tell the whole time they really liked the guy.
Perhaps it is unfair to compare these movies to the Potter franchise, and perhaps the books and movies will get kids into ancient literature and mythology, but these movies are missing the mark—both times. The translation from book to screen is missing something. The screenplay to Sea of Monsters was written by comics guy Marc Guggenheim (Green Lantern-movie, The Flash, Arrow) and unfortunately what may be working for comic books is not working in execution and production for either of their last two films.
Ideally we'd ship all copies of this movie in a big cardboard box at Olympian Postal Service and Captain Mal will let us borrow their mystical tape gun….and they will disappear.
People For the American Way today urged presidential candidate Mitt Romney to rebuke longtime NRA board member Ted Nugent for remarks they made at the NRA annual convention on Saturday. Nugent, who endorsed Romney in early March, called on NRA members to vote for Romney and denounced the “vile, evil, America-hating” Obama administration. They finished their remarks with a call to cut off the heads of Democrats this fall: “We need to ride into that battlefield and chop their heads off in November.”
Nugent's comments, which were first reported by People For the American Way's Right Wing Watch, came one day after Romney themselves addressed the convention. Nugent's endorsement was touted by Tagg Romney in early March.
“We don't expect moderation from Ted Nugent,” said Michael Keegan, President of People For the American Way. “But we do expect a major presidential candidate like Mitt Romney to rebuke a prominent supporter for spewing hate-filled and violent rhetoric against the President of the United States.”
“This is far from the first time that Nugent has advocated violence against their political adversaries. Mitt Romney should clearly and loudly reject Nugent's endorsement and rebuke their inflammatory comments.”

With Apple set to hold their iPhone event on September 10, iPad owners are holding their breath for October, which could most likely see the launch of new iPads again. New images of have appeared only of what appears to be the fifth generation iPad shell posted by Weibo user xubolong (via NoWhereElse.fr).
The new design is thinner and takes design cues from the iPad mini, well in line with what the rumour mill has been churning out. Bloomberg reported last week a thinner iPad and Retina iPad mini would possibly debut after the iPhone.
Check out the images below:
Along with these alleged iPad 5 shell images, a picture was also uploaded of what claims to be the iPhone 5S shell, with the back exterior showing no Apple logo or any other markings. Previously, images had surfaced claiming to be the next iPhone 5S in the colour gold. The shell below appears to look similar to that gold shell previously posted.
Here's another image of what appears to be the white iPhone 5S, reflecting rumours of a dual-LED flash, but most likely is a Chinese factory clone of the real thing:
As we move closer to the iPhone 5S and iPad launches, expect more leaks to make their way online. What do you think of these latest images?
One Of Ragnarok PSP's Earliest Chapters Is A High Priestess Rescue Mission
By Spencer . May 23, 2011 . 1:08pm
GungHo is bringing Ragnarok Online to handhelds again. Ragnarok: The Imperial Princess of Light and Dark is a more story driven game where players can see the narrative through multiple perspectives.
Ragnarok for PSP is also played in chapters. The game's opening chapter follows the protagonist, Torene, Cynthia, and Yui as they flee from monsters. In chapter 2, the group visit an orphanage from Torene's village. There they discover Riberia, an Aura-ite and director of the orphanage, and Fiona, a shy high priestess, we're attacked by thieves. Now, you have to rescue them.
Ribeira is on the left and Fiona is on the right. Below we have Guston (a lord knight), Berkut (a sniper), Veda (a shaman), and Gillesde, the head of council in Aura.
Many had hoped that the “adults” in the White House would check the influence of Donald Trump's “yes men” and steady a chaotic president. Instead of them making Trump better, he's actually making them worse.
In the past week or so, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, Vice President Mike Pence, White House press secretary Sean Spicer, Deputy press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders, Deputy National Security Adviser Dina Powell, and National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster have all publicly backed up some Trump claim, only to have them later cut their legs out from under them.
The most unfortunate example may be McMaster, who, on Tuesday night, went in front of cameras and insisted that the premise of a story in The Washington Post alleging Trump gave classified information to Russia was false. The next morning, Trump seemed to contradict that statement on Twitter. We can quibble over details and semantics, but the bottom line was that it didn't look good.
During a Tuesday press conference, McMaster did little to quell concern, ending the presser by telling us: “The president wasn't even aware of where this [classified] information came from.”
McMaster has a sterling reputation, and one hopes that this won't besmirch that or negate the many good things they have done.
Unfortunately, one byproduct of Trump's candidacy and presidency has been their ability to compromise people who once seemed incorruptible. This destruction of heroes only reinforces the erosion of public trust that already plagues America.
Another example: On Sunday, U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley averred that Trump “can fire anyone they want,” because he's the “CEO of the country.” At first, I was going to cut them some slack on the CEO comment, but they reiterated their point several times.
This statement is both untrue and telling. Yes, the American president has substantial power, but he's not the CEO, and a country is not a company.
The president and their aides are not the only ones enabling Trump's behavior—or perpetuating the erroneous assumption that they are our “boss.” We the people bear much of that responsibility. We usually get what we want—or, at the very least, what we deserve.
According to a recent poll, nearly half of Americans surveyed “say things have gotten so far off track that we need a leader who is willing to break some rules if that is what it takes to set things right, while 50 percent disagree.” This trend is consistent with other polls we have seen. A shocking survey done last year showed that younger Americans are increasingly OK with authoritarianism.
Not everyone who wants a strongman who is willing to bend the rules supports Donald Trump (although, according to the survey, working-class whites are more attracted to authoritarianism than are college graduates). Some people probably want a strongman of their own—to take on Trump. To fight fire with fire. The ends may justify the means, but we all have different means. Wherever you stand ideologically, you're probably more willing to break a few eggs to make an omelet.
That doesn't let Donald Trump off the hook. Trump sees themselves as a special snowflake. In their mind, the rules don't apply to him. But what complicates matters is that their team seems to be reinforcing their worst instincts—whether that is bolstering their authoritarian tendencies, tempting them with fake news, or sacrificing their own credibility to defend the indefensible.
To be sure, some of the rules literally do not apply to him. The famous line from the David Frost interviews with Richard Nixon is, “When the president does it, that means it is not illegal.” That line has haunted me lately. First, when we were reminded that firing an FBI director, regardless of the circumstances, is perfectly permissible. A few days later, we were reminded that the president could give classified information away to the Russians, because, after all, they can simply declassify it. The saying is that this was “lawful, but awful.”
So where does that leave us? I don't want to sound hysterical; I think there has been too much handwringing over this in the media. But at some point, this becomes untenable. The truth is that it's unrealistic to expect Trump's supporters to turn on a dime, and since the notion that Trump is going to mature or “pivot” now seems absurdly quixotic, our last line of defense is the so-called adults who hold positions of power both in—and out—of their administration. Because they are failing to speak truth to power, we risk sliding into soft despotism.
The ongoing avalanche of mass-BitTorrent lawsuits reveal that IP-addresses can get people into a heap of trouble and it's not unusual for Internet subscribers to be wrongfully accused of sharing copyrighted material. This begs the question, for how long are these IP-addresses stored? To find out, TorrentFreak asked some of the largest Internet providers in the US about their logging practices.
Currently there are no mandatory data retention laws in the United States. Unlike in Europe, Internet providers are not required to track IP-address assignments so these can be linked to specific subscriber accounts.
The question is, for how long will this remain the case, especially considering SOPA author Lamar Smith's introduction of a new bill last year. Under their Protecting Children From Internet Pornographers Act, ISPs will be required to keep IP-address logs for a minimum of a year.
For now, however, no logs are required by law.
Earlier this week the CEO of Sonic called on fellow ISPs to protect the privacy of subscribers and purge logs after two weeks like their company does. One of the reasons cited was the massive amount of civil subpoenas that are, ironically enough, often sent by “Internet pornographers” in mass-BitTorrent lawsuits.
A refreshing stance, and one that makes users of other providers curious about the logging practices of their ISPs. Unfortunately, nearly all providers are very secretive about their data retention policies. Unlike VPN providers, all admit to logging IP-addresses, but how long they retain them remains a mystery.
In an attempt to find out more, TorrentFreak contacted several large ISPs with the seemingly simple question; How long does “company X” store IP-address assignment logs? Our findings are detailed below.
Those who value their privacy and hide their IP-address can of course always sign up with a VPN provider, one that doesn't keep logs.

Time Warner Cable
Time Warner informed us that they store IP-address logs for up to 6 months.
Interestingly, the company is the only ISP we contacted that also posts information regarding its data retention on its website.
Comcast
Comcast did not respond to our inquiries but has mentioned a 180 day retention policy for IP-addresses in BitTorrent-related court documents. On some occasions cases have been dismissed because logs were no longer available, meaning that alleged infringers could not be identified.
The 180 day policy is also mentioned in the Comcast Law Enforcement Handbook that leaked in 2007.
Verizon
Verizon's Privacy Office informed TorrentFreak by email that information about IP address assignments is retained for 18 months, the longest of all ISPs who responded to our request.
Qwest/Century
The Qwest/CenturyLink Law Enforcement Support Group informed us that IP-address logs are kept for approximately 1 year. As is also the case with other Internet Providers, Qwest/Century noted that personal details are only disclosed when the company receives a subpoena.
Cox
Cox failed to reply to our inquiry, but previously it has mentioned a 6 month retention policy for IP-address assignments in the press. In Cox's “Lawful Intercept Worksheet” the company also mentions that logs are kept for “up to 6 months.”
AT&T
AT&T's IP-address logging practices are not public. Initially the company did not reply to out inquiry, but upon publishing AT&T's Privacy Policy Team promised to get back to us as soon as they find out how long logs are kept. We will update this article as soon as their response arrives.
Update (2014): AT&T has never responded but this document posted by ACLU suggest that they retain data for about a year.
Charter
Charter lists no information about their IP-address retention in its privacy policy. However, a reader alerted us to an answer on Charter's website where it states that residential IP-addresses are retained for one year.
—
The ISPs below were added after publication.
– DSL Extreme says they retain radius IP logs for two weeks on their DSL service.
– Teksavvy (Canada) keeps IP-assignment logs for two years 90 days.
– Eastlink (Canada) keeps IP-assignment logs for one year
– Start Communications (Canada) keeps IP-assignment logs for 90 days
—
As far as we are aware, this is the first overview of IP-logging practices of the largest U.S. ISPs. However, we need help to make the list more complete as not all the providers we contacted replied.
We encourage all readers to tweet, mail or phone their Internet providers to get a more complete overview, including ISPs not listed above. This is not limited to providers in the U.S. Feel free to forward us the answers so we can expand this article.

"In a perfect world, it might have been preferable for the pools to coincide precisely with the tower footprints," said Daniel Libeskind, the master planner of the trade center site. "But their emotional geometry and integrity are more important. They are at the epicenters of where the towers stood, and much like the twin beams of light, though not exact replicas, they accurately and movingly reflect the power of absence."
Anthony Gardner, executive director of the World Trade Center United Family Group and a leading preservation advocate at ground zero, does not agree. They said the failure to replicate the towers' dimensions and their distinctive cutaway corners "minimizes the enormity of the buildings themselves, the scale of the loss and what was taken."
This is not the only place in the trade center redevelopment where symbolism and literalism diverge.
For instance, the skyline element is routinely described as the 1,776-foot Freedom Tower. But the tower itself is not 1,776 feet tall. That figure comes from adding a mast to a 1,368-foot building. And because of topography, the 1,776-foot mast is actually 1,779 feet above the nearby intersection of Fulton and West Streets.
The symbolic 1776 dimension was proposed by Mr. Libeskind and embraced by Gov. George E. Pataki. David M. Childs of Skidmore, Owings & Merrill, architects of the Freedom Tower, was quoted last week by The Poughkeepsie Journal (and then on The Gutter, an architectural Web site) as saying that they "never understood" that decision, "because this building will always be measured in meters." At 541 meters, the Freedom Tower will symbolically commemorate the year Totila became king of the Ostrogoths.

Around the pools, the twin towers' dimensions will be observed at two levels, said Stefan Pryor, the president of the development corporation. The rear walls of the galleries surrounding the pools will be 204 feet apart, the inside dimension of the footprints.
And the pool containment structures, which will be visible from the underground museum, will be 211 feet and 10 inches across. Their exterior walls will align with the remnants of the towers' original column footings, preserved at a level just above bedrock.
"Where the authentic artifacts of the original towers are displayed," Mr. Pryor said, "you'll be able to view the authentic size of the original towers."
One can argue that the pools are so big, the difference will be imperceptible; that the most useful place to represent the dimensions accurately is where visitors will spend the longest time; and that it makes sense to create a visual correspondence between the towers' true dimensions and the column remnants that once defined their perimeters.

It's just that this is probably not the visual correspondence most people will expect. Future visitors will undoubtedly look across the vast expanses of those memorial pools, marveling at how large the World Trade Center towers must have been.
And they will see only 69 percent of the story.
The search for a construction manager to oversee the memorial and memorial museum drew 13 companies to a bid preparation conference yesterday. "We were thrilled by the interest and impressed by who came," said Gretchen Dykstra, president and chief executive of the memorial foundation.
Bovis Lend Lease and Slattery Skanska, already in a joint venture approved to build the World Trade Center PATH terminal and transportation hub, attended. So did the Gilbane Building Company, LiRo Group, Pavarini McGovern, F. J. Sciame Construction and Turner Construction Company, among others. Bids are due Jan. 10.

As record cold temperatures plowed across much of the United States earlier this week, no piece of infrastructure was left unaffected. Trains were stalled, flights were cancelled, and schools were closed.
Although most people might not have noticed, the electrical grid was not immune to the effects of the cold snap. PJM Interconnection, the largest U.S. grid operator, hit a new record winter peak use of 141 500 megawatts. The peak energy use came at a time when nearly 20 percent of the generators in PJM's territory were down due to the frigid weather. On Wednesday morning, nearly 40 000 megawatts of PJM's 190 000-MW installed capacity were offline.
Some of the generation losses were due to natural gas pipeline constraints, which caused gas price spikes across much of the United States. Natural gas is also the most predominant heating fuel in the U.S.; as more utilities build gas generators, they must compete with other natural gas needs during cold spells.
But natural gas availability was only a small part of the picture. Steam-cycle fossil fuel-fired power plants (primarily coal) made up about half of the outages, with diesel generators making up the second largest portion.
PJM does not require power plant operators to specify why generators have gone down, but it seemed as if nearly every cause of failure played a role this week. In some cases, coal stacks were frozen or diesel generators simply couldn't function in such low temperatures.
“It's been everything,” Michael Kormos, executive vice president of operations for PJM, said of the failures. “From mechanical problems to just normal fails that happen when we push them as hard as we're pushing them.” Because so much generation was unavailable during the high-demand, PJM was asking any operators to deliver the greatest possible output from available generators.
To cope with the thin margins, PJM operators cut voltage by 5 percent at times and asked residential and small business customers to reduce their power use. PJM also invoked demand response, where it asks large power users to reduce their load. EnerNOC, one of the largest demand response aggregators in the United States, said this week's events were the largest winter dispatch in the company's history.
New York's Independent System Operator and Texas's ERCOT also relied on demand response to meet electrical demand during the cold weather. While demand response was once primarily used during the hottest days of summer, it is now seen as a resource that can be called upon all year long to balance grid needs and help in emergencies.
When they could, PJM operators bought extra power from neighboring grids.
PJM is also investing billions of dollars in transmission upgrades to cope with the loss of retiring coal plants and the variability that comes with increased renewable energy; these improvements may have helped with generation issues over the past week.
Some local utilities outside of PJM, particularly in the southeast, did not fare nearly as well because of a greater incidence of generators that were unprepared to operate in frigid conditions. The Tennessee Valley Authority, for example, had to shut down Murray State University to avoid a larger blackout. ERCOT, the grid operator in Texas, narrowly avoided rolling blackouts. After rolling blackouts during winter of 2011, ERCOT demanded that generators invest more in winterization, which helped when the low temperatures spread into Texas this week.
Now that the polar vortex has lifted, it is unclear whether utilities will invest in winterization to arm their facilities against such extreme weather conditions. At least one South Carolina utility, SCE&G, which had rolling blackouts after remote transmitters froze, noted that it's impossible to winterize every component but there would be lessons learned. For the large grid operators, such as PJM and ERCOT, there will also be lessons learned on how to avoid such close margins, even though the lights stayed on.

Where we split from sharks: Common ancestor comes into focus

(click to enlarge)
The common ancestor of all jawed vertebrates on Earth resembled a shark, according to a new analysis of the braincase of a 290-million-year-old fossil fish that has long puzzled paleontologists. New research on Acanthodes bronni, a fish from the Paleozoic era, sheds light on the evolution of the earliest jawed vertebrates and offers a new glimpse of the last common ancestor before the split between the earliest sharks and the first bony fishes -- the lineage that would eventually include human beings.
"Unexpectedly, Acanthodes turns out to be the best view we have of conditions in the last common ancestor of bony fishes and sharks," said Michael Coates, PhD, professor of organismal biology and anatomy at the University of Chicago and senior author of the study published in Nature. "Our work is telling us that the earliest bony fishes looked pretty much like sharks, and not vice versa. What we might think of as shark space is, in fact, general modern jawed vertebrate space."
The group gnathostomes, meaning "jaw-mouths," includes tens of thousands of living vertebrate species, ranging from fish and sharks to birds, reptiles, mammals and humans. Cartilaginous fish, which today include sharks, rays, and ratfish, diverged from the bony fishes more than 420 million years ago. But little is known about what the last common ancestor of humans, manta rays and great white sharks looked like.
Coates and colleagues Samuel Davis and John Finarelli found answers to this mystery in an unexpected place: the acanthodians, extinct fishes that generally left behind only tiny scales and elaborate suites of fin spines. But armed with new data on what the earliest sharks and bony fishes looked like, Coates and colleagues re-examined fossils of Acanthodes bronni, the best-preserved acanthodian species.
Davis created highly detailed latex molds of specimens revealing the inside and outside of the skull, providing a valuable new data set for assessing cranial and jaw anatomy as well as the organizations of sensory, circulatory and respiratory systems in the species.
"We want to explore braincases if possible, because they are exceptionally rich sources of anatomical information," Coates said. "They're much better than scales, teeth or fin spines, which, on their own, tend to deliver a confusing signal of evolutionary relationships."
The analysis of the sample combined with recent CT scans of skulls from early sharks and bony fishes led the researchers to a surprising reassessment of what Acanthodes bronni tells us about the history of jawed vertebrates.
"For the first time, we could look inside the head of Acanthodes, and describe it within this whole new context," Coates said. "The more we looked at it, the more similarities we found with sharks."
However, analysis of the evolutionary relationships of Acanthodes bronni -- even with these new data added -- still connected this species to early bony fishes. Meanwhile, some acanthodian species turned out to be primitive sharks, while others were relatives of the common ancestor of sharks and bony fishes.
This result explains some of the longstanding confusion about the placement of acanthodians in vertebrate history. But additional analyses went a step further. Using more than 100 morphological characters, the researchers quantified the mutual resemblance among the earliest jawed fishes. Acanthodians as a whole, including the earliest members of humans' own deep evolutionary past, appear to cluster with ancient sharks.
"The common ancestors of all jawed vertebrates today organized their heads in a way that resembled sharks," said Finarelli, PhD, Lecturer in Vertebrate Biology at University College Dublin. "Given what we now know about the interrelatedness of early fishes, these results tell us that while sharks retained these features, bony fishes moved away from such conditions."
Furthermore, the analysis demonstrated that all of these early members of the modern gnathostomes are clearly separated from what now appear to be the most primitive vertebrates with jaws: a collection of armored fishes called placoderms.
"There appears to be a fundamental distinction between the placoderms and all other vertebrates with jaws," Finarelli said.
This new revision of the lineage of early jawed vertebrates will allow paleontologists to dig into deeper mysteries, including how the body plan of these ancient species transformed over the transition from jawless to jawed fishes.
"It helps to answer the basic question of what's primitive about a shark." Coates said. "And, at last, we're getting a better handle on primitive conditions for jawed vertebrates as a whole."
"This study is an example of the power of phylogenetics combined with the comparative morphology of living and fossil organisms," said Maureen Kearney, program director in National Science Foundation's Division of Environmental Biology, which co-funded the research. "It shows us important evolutionary transitions in the history of life, providing a new window into the sequence of evolutionary changes during early vertebrate evolution."
The study, "Acanthodes and shark-like conditions in the last common ancestor of modern gnathostomes," will be published on June 14 by Nature. The research was also funded by the Natural Environment Research Council.
Two months after Haiti confirmed it was having an outbreak of the painful mosquito-borne virus chikungunya in 2014, Haitians began complaining about a new fever epidemic and wondered whether it was Zik or Zika, the other virus carried by the same mosquito.
Haiti health officials and experts from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention quickly dismissed the Zika rumors, regarding the fever symptoms as another bout of fast-spreading chikungunya.
Now, infectious-disease specialists at the University of Florida believe that diagnosis was wrong. Zika, according to new research, was not only present in the Western Hemisphere before it was confirmed in Brazil in March 2015 — it was in Haiti.
“What seems to have happened is that the chikungunya outbreak was followed by [dengue] and Zika,” Dr. J. Glenn Morris, Jr., a professor of medicine and the director of the University of Florida's Emerging Pathogens Institute, which runs a lab in Haiti, said about the June 2014 rumors sweeping Haiti.

Moris said the UF study, while focused on samples taken in December 2014, suggest that it's not “an unreasonable possibility that” the dengue-like symptoms that Haitians were reporting in June of 2014 were Zika cases.
Following Haiti's April 2014 chikungunya outbreak, UF's laboratory began monitoring the virus and collecting blood samples from schoolchildren in the Gressier/Leogane region, southwest of Port-au-Prince, where the laboratory is located.
Soon, the center's nurses began noticing that some of the children started coming down with a fever.
“The nurses said, ‘Everybody is getting it again,'” Morris said, recalling how almost everyone dismissed the illness as a second wave of chikungunya.
Everyone except for one curious virologist: John Lednicky, who would become the lead author of UF's study on the findings. The study was published Monday in PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases.
The scientists from UF's environmental and global health department and the Emerging Pathogens Institute specialists began doing additional lab studies. Sick schoolchildren had blood sampled and were screened for dengue, chikungunya and malaria. After the samples came back negative for all three, they were classified as “mystery” viruses.
Using a more sophisticated testing method, researchers subsequently sequenced and identified the Zika virus. The plasma samples that yielded Zika virus were taken in December 2015, three months before Brazilian scientists confirmed that Zika was present in the South American country.
The Haitian strain, while genetically similar to the Brazilian, is more similar to the strain from the French Polynesian islands, said Dr. Jacques Boncy, director of Haiti's National Public Health Laboratory.
In June 2014, Boncy was asked about whether Zika was present in Haiti. They told the Miami Herald that Zika had been confirmed in Yap Island and in French Polynesia, islands in the Pacific, but it was “not in the Caribbean region.”
Now, after speaking with Morris, Boncy says they may have been wrong.
“They did sequencing, and that is where they saw three children who came back positive for Zika,” they said.
Boncy said that before Zika was confirmed in Brazil, it was reported on Easter Island, a Chilean territory, where an annual festival is believed to be the source of transmission. On March 3, 2014, Chile notified the Pan-American Health Organization/World Health Organization of Zika's existence on the island.
Haiti has United Nations troops from Chile stationed in the country, and a number of Haitians are employed in Brazil's construction industry — factors that could have led to Zika's transmission in the country.
“We will never know where the current Zika outbreak in the Americas started,” said Daniel Impoinvil, CDC research epidemiologist involved in helping Haiti monitor the spread of the virus. “Most likely it was imported into Haiti and once it is imported, you can expect additional cases.”
Impoinvil noted that during the time period of the UF study, Haiti was 20 weeks into a major chikungunya outbreak.
“The symptoms of chikungunya, dengue and Zika are remarkably similar,” they said. “Given the similar symptoms and the lack of history of Zika in the Americas and around the world at that time, Zika would not necessarily have been considered as a source of infection.”
As of April 2, there have been 2,024 suspected reported cases of Zika in Haiti since the virus' Jan. 15 confirmation, the CDC said. A dozen of the cases involve pregnant women.
CDC director Dr. Tom Frieden recently confirmed that a study looking at brain scans of babies born with suspected Zika-related microcephaly in Brazil confirms that the virus causes the birth defect. Babies with the birth defect have been born with smaller than usual heads to mothers infected with Zika in Brazil and several other countries, according to the WHO.
“We haven't yet found any cases of microcephaly, but we have found about three cases of Guillain-Barré Syndrome,” Boncy said. Guillain-Barré Syndrome, also linked to Zika, is a neurological syndrome in adults that leads to difficulty in walking.
Morris said the lack of money for Zika research is frustrating, and stifles scientists' ability to find answers to so many unknowns. Funding for Zika research, preparation and treatment remains stalled in Congress.
“This was an unexpected pathogen; we didn't think Zika would come in and do all of this,” they said. “Zika was an obscure disease that you learned for your medical boards. There is still an awful lot that we don't know about it.''
Zika is transmitted by the same mosquito, the Aedes aegypti, that transmits dengue and chikungunya.
To help Haiti better monitor Zika outbreaks, the CDC has trained staff at the National Public Health Laboratory on Zika testing. The lab now can independently conduct Zika tests.
“Our studies in Haiti have just scratched the surface,” they added. “Where it is coming from, where it is moving, how it is evolving? Our entire purpose is to try and answer these questions.”
Annette Hughes, Economist & Director, EY DKM Economic Advisory said:
“Let's hope that the Minister does not stray from the core objectives set out last year in their 2019 Budget speech, namely to safeguard our national public finances, promote fairness and make sensible investments for our long-term future. There is no room for surprises, unpleasant or otherwise. If we are to sustain our position at the top of the European growth league, we need a budget which is grounded in good budgetary practice and avoids any overruns on spending. We also need to ensure we are better able to predict spending plans, especially in health and social welfare, to avoid any spending creep, which can have unintended consequences for our finances in the future.”
The rainy day fund
“The announcement of Rainy Day Fund commitments are welcome, but they are similar to last year with €1.5bn from the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund and an annual contribution of €500m thereafter which represents a missed opportunity to bank corporation tax receipts.”
Capital spending
“It's good to see capital spending prioritised. The additional investment in education is very welcome and should be allocated to sensible long-term investments for our future, adding to the productive potential of the economy. The 24% increase in capital investment to €7.3bn is significant for our construction sector but it will be important to ensure the industry has the capacity and skills to deliver on this and that value for money is achieved. This should be one of the tasks of the Construction Consultative Group established on foot of the National Development Plan.”
Tourism VAT rate
“We understand the rationale for the restoration of the higher VAT rate on tourism. This is a good example of using policy instruments when they are needed during difficult times. With an additional 64,000 jobs created in the food and accommodation sector over the past seven years and tourism numbers at record levels, perhaps this subsidy is no longer justifiable. Whilst acknowledging that tourism may not have fully recovered in some locations, there are better ways of spending the money to support businesses and boost tourism in those locations. The regional initiatives the Minister announced are such measures. This will provide €466 million in 2019 for other areas of the economy where it is most needed, notably housing and childcare.”
Carbon tax
“The decision not to increase the carbon tax is disappointing given Ireland's failure to meet its ongoing greenhouse gas reduction targets, and more particularly in the context of Monday's report from the IPCC, which sets out in the starkest terms yet, the global consequences of failure to tackle climate change.”
Rural Regeneration and Development Fund
“As part of Project Ireland 2040, the Government has already committed to providing initial funding of €315 million over the period 2019—2022 or €78.75m per annum under the new Rural Regeneration and Development Fund to support rural renewal projects in towns and villages with a population of less than 10,000, and outlying areas. The additional allocation of €53m in Budget 2019 for the Fund in order to strengthen our rural economies and communities will go some way to support micro and small construction businesses in regions outside of the urban areas.”
Residential accommodation measures
“Given the crisis in the residential accommodation market, the measure to bring forward the full removal of the restriction on the amount of interest that may be deducted by landlords in respect of loans used to purchase, improve or repair their residential property, is welcome. It will hopefully encourage landlords to increase maintenance of the existing stock of rental property and may even increase supply, as vacant properties are brought back into use. Protecting the existing stock of accommodation is as important as providing new supply.”
Overall comment
“The time of the Budget is a good opportunity to stand back and seriously consider the kind of economy and society we wish to have in the future. This is why the Budget needs to go beyond any sectoral need and deliver for the collective needs of society. Do we want to secure a better quality of life and a more sustainable future for the population? The reality is that we have big choices to make and more tax will be needed. The missed opportunity to broaden the tax base, reduce our reliance on income taxes and increase the carbon tax is disappointing. One objective of taxes should be to change behaviour and therefore improve quality of life, and policymakers need to have the courage to do the right thing even if not the most popular.”
China's economic growth is likely to slow down to 7.2% in the fourth quarter due to weak domestic demand, according to a member of the monetary policy advisory committee at the People's Bank of China (PBOC).
Bloomberg, citing the PBOC's academic Song Guoqing, reported that stronger exports in the second quarter will not compensate for the decline in domestic demand. Song was speaking at a forum in Beijing on 25 October.
Earlier, the world's second largest economy grew by the slowest rate since 2009, amid fears that it will miss its growth target for 2014.
In the third quarter of the year, China's economy expanded by 7.3%. While this beat analysts' forecasts of 7.2%, it represents the slowest expansion for more than five years, when China reported a 6.9% growth in the first quarter of 2009.
Song added that the country's economy would likely expand 7.3% in 2015. On the same day, Fan Jianping, chief economist at China's State Information Centre, expected 2015 growth at 7% unless the central government boosts its stimulus measures.
The forecast is based on their agency's research, which uses China's industrial production as a key indicator to economic growth, according to Fan.
"I don't rule out that we will see on-year expansion lower than 7% in some single quarters next year," Fan said.
GDP expansion in the fourth quarter is seen at 7.2% to 7.3%, leading to a full-year 2014 growth rate of about 7.3%, they said. The country's official growth target for the year is 7.5%.
Analysts polled by Bloomberg expect a growth rate of 7.3% for 2014.
China is presently the world's fastest-growing major economy with annual gross domestic product growth rates averaging 10% for the last 30 years.
However, its economic growth has slowed down recently due to increasing exposure to foreign markets. In 2013, the economy expanded 7.7%, the lowest pace in more than a decade.
China's Premier Li Keqiang previously said that the government's top priority in 2014 was implementation of reforms in order to make economic growth balanced and driven by consumption rather than investment.
Ridley Scott will adapt Don Winslow's The Cartel for 20th Century Fox
While their latest, The Martian, is set to hit the big screen October 2, Ridley Scott has, according to a story published today at The Hollywood Reporter, signed on to helm a big screen adaptation of author Don Winslow's recent bestseller, The Cartel. What's more, Deadline chimed in soon thereafter with the update that 20th Century Fox is looking to get Leonardo DiCaprio to headline.
Published just last month, The Cartel is officially described on Don Winslow's official site as follows:
From the internationally best-selling author of the acclaimed novel The Power of the Dog comes The Cartel, a gripping, true-to-life, ripped-from-the-headlines epic story of power, corruption, revenge, and justice spanning the past decade of the Mexican-American drug wars.
It's 2004. DEA agent Art Keller has been fighting the war on drugs for thirty years in a blood feud against Adán Barrera, the head of El Federación, the world's most powerful cartel, and the man who brutally murdered Keller's partner. Finally putting Barrera away cost Keller dearly—the woman they love, the beliefs they cherish, the life they want to lead.
Then Barrera gets out, determined to rebuild the empire that Keller shattered. Unwilling to live in a world with Barrera in it, Keller goes on a ten-year odyssey to take them down. Their obsession with justice—or is it revenge?—becomes a ruthless struggle that stretches from the cities, mountains, and deserts of Mexico to Washington's corridors of power to the streets of Berlin and Barcelona.
Keller fights their personal battle against the devastated backdrop of Mexico's drug war, a conflict of unprecedented scale and viciousness, as cartels vie for power and they come to the final reckoning with Barrera—and himself—that they always knew must happen.
The Cartel is a story of revenge, honor, and sacrifice, as one man tries to face down the devil without losing their soul. It is the story of the war on drugs and the men—and women—who wage it.
Assuming they sign on, DiCaprio would play the Keller role in the feature film adaptation, which will likely blend plot elements of The Cartel with its literary predecessor, The Power of the Dog. Winslow's creative partner, Shane Salerno will provide the screenplay. Salerno previously provided the screenplay for Oliver Stone's recent Winslow adaptation, Savages.
At a Wisconsin rally on Saturday, Judson Phillips, CEO of “Tea Party Nation”, one of the much tea party splinter groups, claimed that “the left” has “killed a billion people in the last century”.
According to Politico, Phillips and other speakers heated up the rhetoric around Tuesday's historic recall elections, with one speaker referring to Democrats as terrorists who struck at a Republican “Ground Zero”. Vince Shmuki, leader of another tea party group, the Ozaukee Patriots said, “This is ground zero. You remember what the term ground zero means? We have been attacked.”
Earlier this week, Judson Phillips compared protesters who opposed Governor Scott Walker to Nazi storm troopers. On Saturday, they said, “I detest and despise everything the Left stands for. How anybody can endorse and embrace an ideology that has killed a billion people in the last century is beyond me.”
Phillips was appearing at a rally to support Republican State Senator Alberta Darling, who is locked in a heated struggle for their seat against Democratic Representative Sandy Pasch.
Consumers lately have been favoring credit cards that give cash back over those with travel rewards.
Less than half of credit cardholders surveyed by ThePointsGuy.com recently accumulate travel points or miles, and only one in three Millennials. It's no wonder, given that airlines have seriously devalued frequent flier miles and made it more difficult to redeem points for tickets.
“But there is still tremendous value in getting the right travel card,” says Brian Kelly founder of ThePointsGuy.com.
What to Look For
•A hefty bonus. Sign-up bonuses among the 20 most popular travel cards increased 25% this year, according to Kelly. And in some cases, they add, just a single bonus can provide enough miles for a first-class airline ticket anywhere in the world.
•Flexible redemption options. To get the most for your spending dollar, Kelly notes, you're likely better off skipping airline-branded cards that let you rack up miles on a particular carrier (since these limit your redemption opportunities) in favor of cards that let you transfer miles to other loyalty programs or allow you to use the rewards you've accumulated as cash toward any kind of travel purchases.
Most travel cardholders either aren't have such a card or don't take advantage. ThePointsGuy.com's survey found that, among the 42% of people who have travel rewards card, only 19% have ever transferred rewards points or miles from their credit card to an airline's loyalty program.
•No foreign transaction fees. These are another self-inflicted wound for consumers. According to the survey, one-quarter of all credit cardholders have to pay a fee when they buy stuff overseas (it's typically 2% to 4%), and one-third don't know if their card charges them extra. With so many products available that do not charge this fee, a lot of borrowers are throwing money away.
Your Best Bets
MONEY's two Best Credit Card winners for travel offer among the heftiest bonuses in the biz with no foreign transaction fees, and neither leaves you stuck with one airline.
The Barclaycard Arrival Plus World Elite MasterCard offers a sign-up bonus of 40,000 miles once you spend $3,000 within the first 90 days, in addition to two miles per dollar spent. You can redeem the miles as a statement credit against any kind of travel, and get 10% miles back when you do so. This means that the sign-up bonus alone will earn you $440.
Chase Sapphire Preferred‘s sign-up bonus comes in at 40,000 points after you spend $4,000 in the first three months. You receive double points for dining and travel spending, 5,000 points for adding an authorized user and a 20% discount when you book the travel through Chase. While you can apply the points as cash back for travel, you can also transfer them to a number of partner loyalty programs, including Southwest and United.

TUI Group (short for Tourism Union International) is a German travel and tourism company headquartered in Hannover, Germany.[3] It is the largest leisure, travel and tourism company in the world,[4] and owns travel agencies, hotels, airlines, cruise ships and retail stores. The group owns six European airlines - the largest holiday fleet in Europe - and several tour operators based in Europe.
TUI is jointly listed on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange and the London Stock Exchange as a constituent of the FTSE 100 Index.
History [ edit ]
Thomson travel agents in Wetherby, United Kingdom The same branch now in TUI branding (2017)
The origins of the company lie in the industrial and transportation company, Preussag AG, which was originally formed as a German mining company. It was incorporated on 9 October 1923, as Preußische Bergwerks- und Hütten-Aktiengesellschaft (Prussian Mine and Foundry Company). In 1927 it was merged with the Ruhr coal company, Hibernia AG, and electricity utility to become the Vereinigte Elekrizitäts und Bergwerks AG (VEBA AG) (United Electrical and Mining Company).[5]
With the sale of Salzgitter AG and purchase of the navigation and logistics company Hapag-Lloyd AG in 1997, Preussag AG became a global enterprise in the service and leisure industry. At that time, Hapag-Lloyd held a 30% interest in the tourism conglomerate TUI (founded 1968), increased to 100% by 1999.[6] In addition the company acquired 25% of Thomas Cook shares in 1997, which it doubled the following year. On 2 February 1999, the Carlson Leisure Group merged with Thomas Cook into a holding company owned by the German bank, Westdeutsche Landesbank, Carlson Inc and Preussag.[7] However, in mid-2000 Preussag acquired Thomas Cook's rival Thomson Travel and was forced to sell its majority 50.1% stake in Thomas Cook by regulatory authorities.[8] In 2002, Preussag renamed itself TUI AG.
TUI announced a merger of its travel division with the British tour operator First Choice in March 2007,[9] which was approved by the European Commission on 4 June 2007, on the condition that the merged company sell Budget Travel in Ireland.[10] TUI held a 55% stake in the new company, TUI Travel PLC, which began operations in September 2007.[11]
In April 2008, Alexey Mordashov, who purchased their first shares in TUI Travel in autumn 2007, purchased additional TUI Travel shares under S-Group in order to expand TUI Travel into Eastern Europe and Russia.[12][13][14]
Its logistics activities, concentrated in the shipping sector, were kept separate and bundled within Hapag-Lloyd AG. A majority stake in Hapag-Lloyd was sold to the Albert Ballin consortium of investors in March 2009[15] and a further stake was sold to Ballin in February 2012, as TUI worked to exit from the shipping business and to optimize its tourism business with expansion in Russia, China and India under Michael Frenzel.[14][16] Prior to August 2010, John Fredriksen held the largest Norwegian privately held stake in TUI Travel and had a significant influence upon TUI Travel's direction and strategy.[17] As Alexey Mordashov through their S-Group Travel Holding increased their stake in TUI Travel to a stake larger than Fredriksen's stake, the shipping business had to be sold.[17]
In June 2014 the company announced it would fully merge with TUI Travel to create a united group with a value of $US9.7 billion.[18] The merger was completed on 17 December 2014 and the combined business began trading on the Frankfurt and London stock exchanges.[19] Prior to this merger, Alexey Mordashov, the largest private shareholder in TUI Travel, held a blocking stake in TUI Travel through their S-Group.[20] After the merger, Alexey Mordashov's stake was reduced to less than a blocking stake of 25%.[20]
On 12 December 2016, Alexey Mordashov increased their stake in TUI Group from 18% to more than 20%.[20][21] In October 2018, their 24.9% stake is the largest privately held stake in TUI Group.[22] When Mordashov's stake increases to 25%, they will have a blocking stake in TUI Group at its annual meeting.[20][21]

Cruise lines [ edit ]
TUI sponsored Bundesliga club Hannover 96. The airline branch TUIfly's main hub is at Hannover-Langenhagen Airport and it had sponsored the football team since the 2002-2003 season. On 31 March 2011, TUI announced Hannover 96 would be playing "with a smile on their chest" for another 3 years, as it extended the sponsorship contract. The current sponsor contract ran out, but it made TUI the longest running association with any of the 18 Bundesliga teams, with 12 years as the sponsor. As part of the sponsorship TUI was the shirt sponsor, as well as having had advertisements on the perimeter fencing of the AWD-Arena, Hannover's home stadium. There was also advertising in the stadium, on the billboards by the pitch and banners around the stadium, and TUI will also remain the sponsor of the Hannover 96 Soccer School.[37]

Controversies [ edit ]
A 2018 study in the UK found that Tui had the largest gender pay gap reported to date by a major UK company, with its male employees paid more than twice what female employees are paid.[38] And in August 2018, some air passengers questioned the distribution of gendered stickers to children on a flight: "future pilot" for boys, "future cabin crew" for girls.[39]
Disbur­sement is for public financ­e manage­ment, Nation­al Transm­ission Modern­izatio­n Projec­t-I
ISLAMABAD: The World Bank has approved a loan package of $825 million for improving Pakistan's public finance management by introducing a new law and upgrading the country's dilapidated power transmission system to support new generation in the sector.
But the Washington-based lender has pegged the disbursement of $400 million loan for Public Finance Management with the introduction of a new law in parliament, highlighting adverse implications of growing dependency on the lenders on the country's public policies. The Board of Directors of the World Bank also approved a $425-million loan for National Transmission Modernization Project-I, taking total disbursement to $825 million.
The $425-million loan has been obtained on commercial terms that will be returned over a period of 21 years, including a grace period of 6 years. The PFM reform programme is financed by the International Development Association, the World Bank's fund for the poor, with maturity of 25 years, including a grace period of five years.
corporate corner: Askari Bank launches new facility
The $425 million loan will be utilised to modernise the national transmission system by rehabilitating selected 500kV and 220kV substations and transmission lines. The existing transmission system has the capacity to dispatch about 15,000-17,000 megawatts of electricity safely, which is substantially below the generation constrained peak load of over 20,000 MW, according to the World Bank.
It said that system reliability has deteriorated substantially, resulting in several instances of major system collapse in recent years, which appear to be increasing in frequency and severity.
With a substantial volume of new generation now coming online, the strengthening of the transmission and distribution systems is critical, said Illango Patchamuthu, the World Bank Country Director for Pakistan.
The project having a total cost of $562 million will improve supply reliability and lower losses in the transmission network. The government will also contribute $137 million.
The World Bank said that Pakistan's plan to expand power generation during 2017-2022 was beginning to bear fruit. To address the gap between electricity demand and supply, the government has plans to increase generation capacity by 30,000MW by 2022. There has been progress in securing $36 billion required for this expansion, including funds for power system investments planned under the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, it added.
Pakistan also availed $800 million loan from the Asian Development Bank for improving the transmission system but its implementation was marred by delays.
Public finance
The lender also approved $400 million loan for improving the current legal regime of public finance management. The public financial management inefficiencies contribute to Pakistan's weak performance in health and education sector, and despite a substantial increase, financial resources fail to reach clinics and schools on time, said the World Bank.
The $400 million public financial management reform programme will address these challenges through the enactment of a robust public finance management law, which will lead to decentralisation of payment and empower the front-line service delivery managers, it added.
The programme will also focus on strong cash management; timely and comprehensive reporting; improved federal-provincial coordination; timely release of funds; streamlined payroll and pension systems; efficient and transparent procurement, and user-friendly reports for citizen engagement.
The World Bank pegged disbursement of the $400-million loan to the approval of the draft Public Finance Management Bill 2017 from the National Assembly. The releases will be linked with the initiation of the process to get the bill approved.
Banks told to implement State Bank's SOP for security
The World Bank has found serious flaws in the current public finance management system that it wants to correct through a billion-dollar programme.
The World Bank stated that budgeting, accounting, reporting and auditing rules and procedures require revisions to align the government's financial management system with medium-term budgets, electronic fund transfers and requirements due to a shift in responsibilities after the 18th Amendment in the Constitution.
It further noted that there was no link between approved budget and procurement plans with inefficiencies in procurement systems and processes that result in project implementation delays. There is also a need for improved and timely service delivery in pension payments to prevent and detect unlawful pension payments on time.

After spending almost three weeks this summer arguing to a jury that Samsung had persistently copied its products, Apple won a stunning $1.05 billion patent and trademark verdicts. But after that win—which, if it holds up, will be the largest patent verdict in history—Apple continued to pursue a even bigger prize. It sought a court-ordered injunction that would kick Samsung phones off the market altogether.
Now it's clear that an injunction is not in the cards. In an order [PDF] issued Monday, US District Court Judge Lucy Koh said that while Apple had established that "design, as a general matter, is important to consumers more broadly," it hadn't proven that infringement of its design patents caused "irreparable harm."
They go on to discuss utility patents:
Apple did not establish at the preliminary injunction stage that the '381 patent was central enough to Samsung's products to drive sales, and has not established that fact here either. Nor has Apple established that either the '915 or the '163 patents actually drive sales of any Samsung products. Neither statements about broad categories, nor evidence of copying, nor the conjoint survey provides sufficiently strong evidence of causation.
The '163 patent had to do with the tap-to-zoom function, while the '915 and the '381 concerned pinch-to-zoom and the "rubber band" feature, respectively.
Apple had more luck asking for an injunction on the grounds that Samsung had infringed its "trade dress," the unique look of its products. But the problem with that argument is that none of the Samsung products found to "dilute" Apple's trade dress are on the market, in any form. "The parties have cited, and the Court is aware of, no case issuing a permanent injunction under the [Federal Trade Dilution Act] for products that are no longer available."
The company will surely ask for an injunction again on appeal, but that will take many months. Even at that time, it's going to be a very high bar. It looks like Apple may have to be satisfied with monetary damages in this case.
The last key post-trial issue Koh has to rule on is the issue of damages. Apple wants them to be significantly increased because of Samsung's willfulness. But at the key post-trial hearing last week, Koh was asking more questions about lowering damages than increasing them.
More than a dozen Samsung phones were found to infringe Apple patents. But by the time the injunction issue was fully briefed and argued in court, only three of the more than 20 Samsung phones accused at trial were still on the market—all different versions of the Galaxy S II.
When Koh made their final plea for a settlement last week, Apple's lawyer suggested that if they don't get an injunction, the litigation will have to drag on.
"If there's a new trial on damages, or no injunction—if you didn't see the same case that the jury saw—then I'm not sure," said Apple lawyer Harold McElhinny during last week's hearing. "I'm not sure how we get a resolution." The billion-dollar verdict, they said, would amount to no more than a "slap on the wrist."
While the products at issue here aren't on the cutting edge of the market anymore, the impact on Apple's overall litigation crusade is still very significant. If they couldn't convince a judge to grant a product-killing injunction after a major win in front of a jury, there's no reason to believe it will suddenly get easier, even if they do have another victory.
A new lawsuit full of patent claims and counter-claims involving Samsung's and Apple's newest phones is working its way through the courts as well. That case is scheduled for trial in 2014.
Jury supervisor in the clear — no new trial
In a separate order [PDF], Koh put to rest Samsung's wish for a new trial because of alleged misconduct by the jury supervisor, Velvin Hogan.
Samsung had argued Hogan was biased against it the whole time. They didn't disclose a lawsuit that Seagate, a former employer of Hogan's and a company partly owned by Samsung, filed against them 19 years ago.
Koh wrote:
As an initial matter, it is not clear whether Mr. Hogan was intentionally dishonest. Neither party has conclusively shown whether Mr. Hogan intentionally concealed their lawsuit with Seagate, or whether they merely forgot to mention it when asked by the Court whether they were ever involved in a lawsuit, or whether they believed that the answer they gave had sufficiently responded to the Court's question. Further, it is not even clear that Mr. Hogan knew of any relationship between Seagate and Samsung. Mr. Hogan left Seagate's employment in 1993, and their lawsuit against Seagate was nearly two decades ago.
Even if Hogan had been dishonest, Koh ruled, Samsung had waived its right to object because it didn't inquire much about Seagate during jury selection.
"Samsung cannot use post-verdict statements unrelated to any potential bias to restart the clock on its obligation to investigate," Koh wrote.
As for Samsung's post-trial project of combing through Hogan's interviews and finding spots where they were wrong on the the law, whatever evidence it produces in that manner is barred by the rules of evidence, Koh found. They had no outside knowledge "specific to the facts of this case," and their comments about what happened during deliberations, or jurors' "mental processes," are inadmissible.
Samsung's request for a new trial was a huge longshot based on one juror's long-ago connection to a company not even on trial. It's unsurprising that Koh would stand by the jury's verdict and not allow Samsung's fishing expedition to continue.
I Love You Like A Brother
Alex Lahey
“I'm just some random from Melbourne.”
Alex Lahey likes to keep it real. The 24-year-old Australian musician takes their rise up the ranks from music student to ‘an artist with one of the most highly anticipated debut albums of 2017' in their stride.
Lahey sees their life as ordinary: “I fall in love, I have a family, I go out with my friends, I like to have a drink.” However, most people can't distil those universal experiences into wry, punchy indie-rock songs - three minute odes to millennial angst and all the complicated feelings that come with it. Alex Lahey can. ‘Love You Like A Brother' is proof.
Born and raised in Melbourne, Lahey initially studied jazz saxophone at university but unimpressed with “learning music in such a regimented way” they switched to an arts degree (see their ‘B-Grade University' EP for more details). Them tenure with cult music collective Animaux allowed Lahey the musical anarchy they yearned - hell, they booked the band their first gig before they'd even prepared a single song.
Lahey stepped out on their own once they began to write songs that didn't fit Animaux's party space. Songs that were inspired the two people they consider the greatest songwriters of all time, Dolly Parton and Bruce Springsteen. Songs that got them noticed at a local industry conference and scored them a solo management deal. Lahey had graduated.
The ‘Love You Like A Brother' album drops fresh off the back of Lahey's breakthrough in 2016. Last year their ‘You Don't Think You Like People Like Me' single was inescapable and landed them a spot in Australian radio network triple j's prestigious Hottest 100 of 2016. The song's universal tale of rejection took Lahey global - its message, they say, is the flipside of the usual break-up scenario: “Yeah, you're right. It's not me. It IS you.”
And that no-shit-taken attitude is the backbone of ‘Love You Like A Brother'. From the stomping title track ‘Brother' to the gently moving ‘Money', Lahey's debut long-player tells it like it is.
The album found Lahey back in the studio with production partner, and one-half of Holy Holy, Oscar Dawson (Ali Barter, British India). The pair pushed each other to create an intimate sonic experience that comprises scuzzy guitars thrumming over pop melodies, helmed by Lahey's unfussy but arresting vocals.
The album's songs traverse the everyday themes of family, heartbreak and identity. Lacey tells their stories with character… and dry humour – “I've figured it out,” they sing in ‘Awkward Exchange', “you're a bit of a dick” – but there are also moments of darkness. In ‘Taking Care' they muse, “I've gained weight and I drink too much, maybe that's why you don't love me as much.”
‘Taking Care' was written after Alex had an eye-opening conversation with their mother. “I was seeing someone who I knew wasn't treating me well, and chose to ignore it, and I think my mum had picked up on it as well. They just said to me at the end of the conversation, ‘Alexandra, whatever you do, just make sure that you take care of yourself'.”
The poignant ‘Backpack' is a tribute to Lahey's latest relationship, and the unsure start it got off to. “When we first started going out, they warned me about how they're really flighty, and I was like, ‘I just want you to stay. And I don't know if you are.' It's just saying it's hard to hold someone down if they're always thinking about the next place that they're going to. It's hard to give someone a hug when they're walking away. And sometimes it's good to chase them down and be like, ‘Hey, I'm here.'”
And, in case the album's title hadn't given it away already, there's a track for their brother too. “We don't get a choice/So let's stick together,” screams Lahey in ‘Brother'. That angsty love you're hearing is easily explained by Lahey, “My brother and I clashed for a long time, and then all of a sudden as adults, we're really close. I feel like this song is my gift to him.”
The themes of Alex Lahey's album might be universal, but it's the unique approach they take unpacking them that's earned their millions of Spotify streams, buzz-worthy showcases at SXSW and festival sets alongside the likes of Flume, The Kills, At The Drive-In and James Blake as well as guesting on tours with Catfish & The Bottlemen, Tegan & Sara and Blondie.

Altar boys, New York City, ca. 1957
Altar boys, St. John Cantius, today
L E Becker, owner of WARP 9 Comics reports on the DC Retailer Roadshow, held yesterday in Rosemont, Chicago. They write for Bleeding Cool;
I just came back from the DC Chicago road trip and wanted to share a few tidbits before I retire for the evening (a classy way of saying I'm going to sleep)…
Dan DiDio says that the reason that Action & Detective were restarted at #1 (even though the milestone 1000 issues were coming soon) is because if they were not restarted, then no one would take the relaunch seriously. Also, there are NO plans to re-number those 2 books when they DO reach their milestones (like marvel).
Many of the ‘new' outfits shown are “not final” (which to me does not make much sense as we have seen these new uniforms on the new SDCC exclusive toon tumbler and sneaker ad).
Demon Knights Is Game Of Thrones
Some of the titles in DiDio's presentation were compared to (by Didio himself) recent hollywood trends (ie: Demon Knights= HBO's Game of Thrones).
Each title has a six issue commitment (I thought it was 12?).
Flashpoint is a “soft” starting point for the relaunch…in other words, you don't need to read F #5 to understand JLA #1
Advertising will be more significant…not only NATIONAL print/tv/movie ads, but also search engines, Facebook and emails
The target audience is 14-54, but the BUYING target audience males 18-34). they are trying to get the new, lapsed, and loyal readers.
July 20th Is Free DC Comics Sampler Day
For the retailers, they are doing a 75% co-op for advertising (although, to me, if they are already doing advertising, why do they need us?). They are also doing mid-night launch parties, and they are having retailers give out free “sampler” comics on 7/20, the same day as preview night at San Diego Comic Con. Retailers will receive these in quantities of five times their Flashpoint #1 orders.
There will be deep discount incentives on 7 of the titles (Wonder Woman being one of them with NO qualifier, unlike Marvel where you have to increase your order by 150% of another issue/title).
The polybagged JLA #1 that comes with the digital redemption code will have a variant cover (it wasn't announced who would do it however).
41 of the books will have complete 100% returnability at 20 cents per returned strip cover book (which some retailers criticized as ruining “the art form” but we can talk about that another day).
DC will NOT print to order and will have SOME reserves for re-orders, however, it is not a flat percentage across the board.
DC Direct and Mattel will produce product AFTER final designs are okayed.
Print Comics Outsell Digital 630 To One
The best was DC offering to retailers increased sales revenue of digital copies of their titles (through comiXology) if they have a stand alone DC comics portal (kind of forcing a retailer to get a website). They realize that we (the direct market) are their primary bread & butter (for now). The percentage of print over digital sales NOW are 630 to 1. Of course, this could change, but I do NOT think (IMHO) it will change that dramatically overnight.
Overall, the meeting was informative, and some of the books DO look exciting (for some reason, I have a personal morbid curiosity as to the, Vampire title).
This is the final DC Retailer Roadshow I am aware of, you can catch up on LA, Dallas, Baltimore and New York shows here.

It's a $10 discount per release, so if you own everything that's been released so far (Distant Worlds + Return of the Shakturi + Legends + Shadows) then during the post-release promotion period, your price to upgrade to Universe would be $9.99 Download or $19.99 Physical ($49.99 or $59.99 – $40 discount for four previous releases). There will be a page on our site where you can get the upgrade discount coupon. This upgrade will be available through our store only, we don't have a way of doing this through Steam. All you will need to get the upgrade coupon is the serial number for each release.
We'll be offering Steam keys to customers who upgrade and purchase through our site.
The release will be on May 23rd.
We plan for there to be one more Shadows update, but all future modding/feature/performance improvements will be based on the Universe level.
Last week I finally started listening to the uber popular Serial podcast. I know, I know, I am late to the part on this one. I did a bunch of driving around Easter and all of that time in the car finally gave me the chance to listen to most of the episodes of Serial.
It seems like every one I know (or at least most of my Facebook friends) are huge fans of the podcast. Since I have started listening to the podcast, I've been asking everyone I meet if they have listened to Serial as well. I was surprised to learn that not everyone has listened to the podcast or even heard of it.
Serial is a podcast that debuted last fall that looks at one story over several episodes. The first season of Serial focused on the 1999 murder of a Baltimore high school student. Them ex-boyfriend was arrested and convicted of the murder, but they maintain their innocence. Serial was a hit and has become one of the most popular podcasts on iTunes. The Serial podcast is co-produced by Sarah Koenig and Julie Snyder, who are both producers on This American Life, another popular NPR radio show and podcast.
From the November 13, 2014 WSJ article – ‘Serial' Podcast Catches Fire:
In the normally low-profile world of podcasting, “Serial” is a certified sensation—a testament to the power of great storytelling. It's quickly become the most popular podcast in the world, according to Apple, and the fastest to reach 5 million downloads and streams in iTunes history. “Serial” is the top podcast in the U.S., Canada, the U.K. and Australia, and in the top 10 in Germany, South Africa and India.
The popularity of Serial has led to a whole range of Serial spinoff websites and podcasts:
The first season of Serial is fascinating. I have not yet listened to the final episode, but even though I already know the conclusion of the show, I have found every episode worth a listen.
Serial does an incredible job of using storytelling to engage listeners in the story. By telling the story through first person interviews and interviews with experts in the field, Serial gives listeners an in depth look at this particular case and some of the challenges on the US legal system.
The other thing that I think is really interesting about the Serial podcast (and this applies to many of the episodes of This American Life as well) is how this very local story has had the ability to engage the listeners in not only a Baltimore story, but issues that are much bigger than Baltimore.
Serial Podcast + Pittsburgh = ???
Since the toy drive back in December, I have been doing alot of thinking about storytelling. Especially storytelling on the local level. So as I was listening to Serial last week, I started thinking about how the format could be applied to Pittsburgh.
What would it look like if there was a Serial-like podcast about something in Pittsburgh? What story would be good to dig in and research, and what would be the impact of having lots of people in Pittsburgh (and outside of Pittsburgh) listen and research this topic?
If there was a Serial-like podcast cast about a Pittsburgh story – what story would you want to see covered? It doesn't have to be a crime, is their a neighborhood or a place that you want to know more about? What local stories could use a deep dive on research?
I have some ideas for stories, but I am curious to see what stories are suggested and if there are other bloggers and armchair sleuths in Pittsburgh that would be interested in researching a story that is local to Western Pennsylvania.
Please share your story ideas below in the comments or on Twitter with the hashtag #serialpgh.
Serial & Long Form Local Journalism
I am also interested in the idea of local journalism that goes deep into a particular story. There are many times when I have been talking to someone else about a local story and we have wondered why the local media has not done a better job of providing an in-depth look at the issue. Sometimes the Post-Gazette has done a lot of stories on a particular topic, but the PG and most local news sites don't do much to link those articles together. There have been several blog posts written about if Serial is storytelling or journalism, regardless of what category Serial is or is not, I am interested in seeing how an in-depth story can have a local impact.

… and also in the news
Though many key documents from the U.S. District Court case remain sealed, a June 2010 sentencing transcript provides an account of Nakoula's cooperation with federal investigators in Los Angeles (and how their prison sentence was reduced as a result).
Nakoula, 55, was arrested in June 2009 for their role in a check-kiting ring that stole nearly $800,000 from six financial institutions by using stolen Social Security numbers and identities. Nakoula was named in a six-count felony indictment accusing them and unnamed “co-schemers” of perpetrating the bank fraud.
Denied bail, Nakoula, a married father of three, was locked up at the Metropolitan Detention Center in L.A. when they began cooperating with Justice Department lawyers and federal agents. During a series of debriefing sessions, Nakoula provided investigators with a detailed account of the fraud operation and fingered the man who allegedly headed the operation, according to comments made by their lawyer at sentencing.
Nakoula identified the ring's leader as Eiad Salameh, a notorious fraudster who has been tracked for more than a decade by state and federal investigators. In their debriefings, Nakoula said they were recruited as a “runner” by Salameh, who pocketed the majority of money generated by the bank swindles, according to James Henderson, Nakoula's attorney.
Eiad was well connected with Hilarion Cappucci, a Christian Syrian born terrorist, and a major explosives smuggler...
Eiad had disclosed to my brother Farid years ago of their intention to work with Cappucci to smuggle explosives via buses with welded covered compartments. Eiad continually received mal from Tunisia while they were linked with the P.L.O.
It's one of the harshest sentencing schemes in the country and a law that can send people convicted of even nonviolent offenses to prison for life.
Just ask Leandro Andrade. The father of three languishes in California state prison with two consecutive life sentences for shoplifting nine children's videos on two occasions in November 1995...
Israel, who identifies as a "pacifist" liberal with no affiliation to organized religions, and who claims to have no strong opinions about Islam, despite having heard some "alarming" things about the Quran at "seminars," says they support freedom of religion and expression.
Likewise, I can't be sure that this isn't part of some larger deception — anything from a prank to some kind of bizarre intelligence operation. It's phenomenally strange.
Nakoula Nakoula, producer of the film "Innocence of Muslims," has been called in for questioning by the Los Angeles Police Department. This makes sense: The terms of their parole specified that they were not to use the internet without supervision, and they seem to have hopped on the net quite often while posing as "Sam Bacile."If Nakoula walks, you'll know that the fix is in. On the other hand, keeping them behind bars will keep them away from interviewers.The really stunning news is that they seem to have been a snitch for the government ...I hate to sound like one of those guys who interpret all new information as confirmation of a preconceived narrative, but this material really does buttress my theory that Nakoula made a deal with either Mossad, an American intelligence service, or both.They knew they were ready to cut deals. He's not bright enough to run their own show. They work for others.This is not someone who is going to create a bloody international incident of their own accord.Eiad Salameh -- Nakoula's former boss -- is probably the same fellow called "Eiad Salameh Shu'aybat" here and here Eiad Salameh is accused of the same type of fraud that landed Nakoula in jail. Moreover, the author of the afore-linked piece mentions that Eiad is wanted by the LAPD. That detail is congruent with the "Smoking Gun" story excerpted above.Although much remains hazy, it seems that Salameh is a Muslim accused of funding terrorism.I don't know what "mal" is, but the rest seems clear enough. Nakoula's relationship with this guy surely would have put them on the radar of both Mossad and the American intelligence establishment.The obvious question: If Nakoulahates Muslims so much, then why was they so tight with a guy like Salameh? Hell, withnamed Salameh?Another obvious question: If Nakoula is willing to work with an anti-Israel terrorist, then why does their movie go out of its way to proclaim Judaism superior to Islam? Wired reports that the 2009 bust was Nakoula's third. In 1997, they were nabbed for selling watered-down gasoline; in 1997, they were making PCP and meth. Y'know what's odd about this? California has a "three strikes and you're out" law ...Nakoula should be in jail for the rest of their life. Yet they were sentenced to 21 months for ripping off $800,000 -- and they served only a year.Yeah. Justto convince me thatisn't suspicious.Then this same crook immediately went into the movie-making business (about which they knew nothing). Their partners were quite a bizarre crew: Jimmy Israel (a shady real estate operator), Steve Klein (a "patriot" fanatic with spooky connections), Morris Sadek (part of the Pam Geller crowd and a likely Mossad asset) and Joseph Nasrallah Abdelmasih (ditto). Oh -- and somehow, Nakoula managed to secure the services of a well-connected lawyer named James Henderson , who was accused of having organized crime connections by the same informant who accurately told the FBI in February, 2001 that Osama Bin Laden was going to crash jets into the World Trade Center.Everyone seems to have forgotten that Klein used the film's one midnight screening as "bait" in a bizarre anti-terrorist sting. Klein showed up to that party in disguise.On top of all ofis the discomforting fact that when the spotlight first hit him, Nakoula nervously blurted out that their film was funded by Israeli money.If none of this seems spooky to you, your spookmeter is broken.Incidentally: There's an interview with Jimmy Israel here . Israel minimizes their participation in the film -- unconvincingly, in my opinion. One slip seems telling:"Seminars"? What kind of irreligious pacifist liberal goes to "seminars" (plural) which discuss the origins of the Quran in negative terms?Jimmy, who admits that their film had no commercial prospects, also let something else slip out..."Some kind of bizarre intelligence operation." If Jimmy Israel, whoon the damned movie, is thinking along those lines, then so may we.
2013 is Superman's 75th anniversary, and while Zack Snyder‘s Man of Steel is the high-profile centerpiece of DC and Warner Bros.' celebration/promotion of the character, it is by no means the only Superman presence this year. DC is using a Superman anniversary logo company-wide this year on projects related to the character, for starters. And Snyder is producing a new animated short that will trace the development of the character though their many years of existence.
Better yet, Snyder is working with Bruce Timm (Batman: The Animated Series, Justice League) on the short, which will be premiered in animatic form at Comic Con before the full version debuts later this year.
THR reports that the short was designed as:
one continuous shot, without edits, that's an homage to the Man of Steel and their many iterations over the past 75 years: Max Fleischer's cartoons, on-screen portrayals by George Reeves and Christopher Reeve, iconic versions drawn by artists Wayne Boring, Curt Swan and Neal Adams, on up through Henry Cavill's interpretation in Man of Steel.
Sounds like a great concept for the 2-minnute short. Also working on the project is Man of Steel storyboard artist Jay Oliva, and naturally DC's Geoff Johns and Mike Carlin and WB Animation's Peter Girardi are providing input.

We had just moved into a little ranch house in the suburbs. Storybook neighborhood – quiet, friendly neighbors, picket fences, the whole nine yards. Suffice it to say that this was supposed to be a new start for me, a recently single dad, and my three-year-old son. A time to move on from the previous year's drama and stress.
I viewed the thunderstorm as a metaphor for this fresh start: one last show of theatrics before the dirt and grime of the past would be washed away. My son loved it anyway, even with the power out. It was the first big storm he'd ever seen. Flashes of lightning flooded the bare rooms of our house, imparting unpacked boxes with long creeping shadows, and they jumped and squealed as the thunder boomed. It was well past their bedtime before he'd finally settled down enough to go to sleep.
The next morning I found them awake in bed and smiling. “I watched the lightning at my window!” they proudly announced.
A few mornings later, they told me the same thing. “You're silly,” I said. “It didn't storm last night, you were only dreaming!” “Oh…” They seemed somewhat disheartened. I ruffled their hair and told them not to worry, there should be another storm soon.
Then it became a pattern. They would tell me how they watched the lightning outside their window at least twice a week, despite there being no storms. Recurring dreams of that first memorable thunderstorm, I figured.
It's easy to hate myself in hindsight. Everybody assures me there's nothing I could have done, no way I could have known. But I'm supposed to be the guardian of my child, and these are useless words of comfort. I constantly relive that morning: making my coffee, pouring milk over my cereal, and picking up the newspaper to read about the pedophile local authorities had just arrested. It was front-page stuff. Apparently this guy would select a young target (usually a boy), stake out their house for a while, and take flash photos of them through their window while they slept. Sometimes they did more. My stomach sank as the connection was made.
At the time, it was merely something from a child's imagination. In retrospect, it is the scariest thing I've ever heard. About a week before the predator was caught, my son came up to me in their pajamas. “Guess what?” they asked.
“What?”
“No more lightning at my window!”
I played along. “Oh, that's nice, it finally died down huh?”
“No! Now it's in my closet!”
I've yet to see the photos police have collected.

Barbara K. Bodine (born August 28, 1948 in St. Louis, Missouri)[1] is an American academic and former diplomat. Bodine formerly directed the Scholars in the Nation's Service Initiative (SINSI) and lectured at Princeton's Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs.[2] They currently serve as Distinguished Professor in the Practice of Diplomacy and Director of the Institute for the Study of Diplomacy at the School of Foreign Service of Georgetown University.[3]
Education [ edit ]
Bodine earned their B.A. in political science and Asian studies magna cum laude from the University of California, Santa Barbara. They became a member of Kappa Alpha Theta, Gamma Rho chapter, fraternity for women. They received their master's degree from the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University. They also studied at the Chinese University of Hong Kong and the Department of State's Language Training Field Schools in Taiwan and Tunisia.  They are a member of Phi Beta Kappa and serves on the Board of Directors of the UCSB Alumni Association and on the Advisory Council to the Program on Southwest Asian and Islamic Civilization Studies at the Fletcher School. They were the recipient of the UC Santa Barbara Distinguished Alumni Award in 1991.
Diplomatic career [ edit ]
After initial tours in Hong Kong and Bangkok, Bodine spent their career working primarily on Southwest Asia and the Arabian Peninsula. They have twice served in the Bureau of Near East Affairs' Office of Arabian Peninsula Affairs, first as Country Officer for the Yemenis, then as Political-Military officer for the peninsula. They later served as Deputy Office Director. They had assignments as Deputy Principal Officer in Baghdad, and as Deputy Chief of Mission in Kuwait during the Iraqi invasion and occupation in 1990. They were awarded the Secretary of State's Award for Valor for their work in occupied Kuwait during the Gulf War.
Following Kuwait, Bodine was the Associate Coordinator for Operations and later served as the Acting Coordinator for Counterterrorism. They went on to serve as the Dean of Professional Studies at the Department's Foreign Service Institute. They have worked on the secretariat staff of Secretaries Kissinger and Vance, and as a Congressional Fellow in the office of former U.S. Senator Bob Dole. Most recently, Bodine spent a year as the Director of East African Affairs.
Ambassador to Yemen and USS Cole bombing [ edit ]
On November 7, 1997, Bodine was appointed to be Ambassador to the Republic of Yemen. Bodine's appointment in Sana'a coincided with events of major importance in Yemen: In 1999, Bodine negotiated the release of three Americans kidnapped in Yemen. On October 12, 2000, the US Navy Destroyer USS Cole was bombed in a terrorist attack in the Gulf of Aden. In January 2001, en route to the Yemeni city of Taiz to meet with the country's president, a flight carrying Bodine and 90 other passengers from Yemen was hijacked by an Iraqi mid-flight. The plane was diverted to the small African nation of Djibouti, where it landed with the hijacker being overpowered by the crew. Bodine left Yemen as ambassador on August 30, 2001.
Bodine's career was marked by controversy surrounding their relationship with the FBI during its investigation of the USS Cole bombing: The PBS Frontline documentary The Man Who Knew included interviews with officials such as Richard A. Clarke (the Clinton administration's counterterrorism chief) and Barry Mawn (a former head of the New York FBI office) who stated that John P. O'Neill (an FBI agent and al-Qaeda expert) came into a personal conflict with Bodine over different perspectives on Yemen. When O'Neill briefly traveled back to New York for Thanksgiving, Bodine denied their re-entry visa, blocking O'Neill from returning to Yemen to continue the investigation on the USS Cole bombing. Frontline cited sources as saying that "O'Neill's removal from the scene in Yemen may have seriously limited the Cole investigation."[4]
The chilly relationship between Bodine and O'Neill is detailed in Lawrence Wright's The Looming Tower. While O'Neill viewed Yemen as a serious threat, unstable from the Yemeni Civil War, with a large number of weapons, large cells of Ayman al-Zawahiri's al-Jihad, and many Mujahideen veterans from the war in Afghanistan, Bodine, in contrast, viewed Yemen as an infant democracy, a "promising American ally in an unsettled but strategically important part of the world." O'Neill also took a hard line toward the Yemeni security forces and viewed their mission as a criminal investigation, while Bodine viewed O'Neill as reckless and harmful to diplomacy. Bodine was furious when O'Neill arrived with 150 investigators and other staff; they had thought they had an understanding with O'Neill that their staff would total no more than 50.[5] Murray Weiss wrote in The Man Who Warned America, a biography of O'Neill, that Bodine "took an immediate and strong dislike to O'Neill, and seemingly worked to hamper some of their initiatives."[6]
Following the apprehension of Umar Farouk Abdul Mutallab, an alleged suicide bomber who is reported to have been trained and equipped in Yemen, Michelle Shephard, writing in the Toronto Star, published excerpts of an interview they conducted with Bodine.[7] Bodine criticized the withdrawal of support the USA was providing to enhance the governance and infrastructure in Yemen, warning against US unilateral military intervention there:
If we go in and make this our war ... it is suddenly going to become a war against us and we will lose it.
Iraq [ edit ]
After serving in Yemen, Bodine became Diplomat in Residence at the University of California, Santa Barbara, until shortly before the 2003 invasion of Iraq. Bodine was appointed coordinator for central Iraq in charge of Baghdad by the Office of Reconstruction and Humanitarian Assistance (ORHA), which became the Coalition Provisional Authority (CPA) on April 21, 2003. They were removed from that position[8] soon thereafter on May 11, 2003, when Paul Bremer was brought in to replace Retired General Jay Garner as CPA Administrator.[9]
In the media [ edit ]
On September 8, 2006, Bodine complained in the Los Angeles Times about their portrayal in the controversial ABC docudrama The Path to 9/11. In an op-ed, Bodine wrote: "According to the mythmakers, a battle ensued between a cop obsessed with tracking down Osama bin Laden and a bureaucrat more concerned with the feelings of the host government than the fate of Americans and the realities of terrorism. I know this is false. I was there. I was the ambassador."[10][11] The ABC miniseries compressed Bodine's role to a single extended scene suggesting they were dismissive, hostile, and vulgar toward John P. O'Neill from the moment of their arrival in Yemen. Broadcast worldwide on the fifth anniversary of 9/11 (9/10 and 9/11/2006), The Path to 9/11 was based on the official 9/11 Commission Report and other sources. ABC/Disney aired the film in the United States without commercial interruption, adding a disclaimer stating that it was "not a documentary", that various scenes were invented, and that narrative "time compression" was used. In the miniseries, Bodine was played by actor Patricia Heaton. O'Neill could not provide a balancing response to Bodine's comments because they were killed in the September 11 attack on the World Trade Center.
Bodine was interviewed in Charles H. Ferguson's 2007 documentary No End in Sight, and, as a guest on Real Time with Bill Maher, on September 3, 2007.
Bodine was portrayed in the Hulu miniseries adaptation of The Looming Tower by Jennifer Ehle.

Dev Patel, who nails an Australian accent in the upcoming Lion, is starring in a film about the Mumbai terror attacks. Co-writer John Collee, best known for the Happy Feet movies and Master and Commander, says the film centres on victims and heroes of the attack, with the script based on a documentary that focused on the iconic Taj Mahal Palace hotel. "Everyone who came out of that was traumatised by it," Collee says. "We collected real stories from the event, sometimes compiling characters or changing the names of the victims. "The servants, cooks and waiters of the hotel were the real heroes. The police were massively outgunned and couldn't do much so it was up to the hotel staff to hide their clients in various rooms then get them all downstairs to smuggle them out through the back passages and corridors that they knew." The names of the heroic staff who were killed are now inscribed on a memorial wall at the hotel.
The attacks took place in multiple locations in Mumbai, including a cafe, train station, hospital, cinema and Jewish community centre. "We decided just to focus on this one place and do it like the old Towering Inferno, those sorts of movies, which we both like," Collee says. "It's an ensemble piece and an old-style disaster movie." Once shooting wraps, the crew will head to Mumbai for further filming. Heavyweight Hollywood distributor the Weinstein Company snapped up North American and British rights at the Cannes Film Festival. It has a fair investment in Patel, with another highly anticipated Australian film that they star in, Lion, having its world premiere soon at the Venice Film Festival. The Mumbai terrorist attacks have also inspired another coming Australian film, Lliam Worthington's low-budget psychological thriller One Less God, which looks at the "theatre of the mind" that plays out among travellers trapped in their hotel.
In more Australian film news ... Girl Asleep wins $100,000 prize ahead of release The critics loved Girl Asleep, but audiences barely noticed it. Winning a handy $100,000 in the country's richest film prize has been a boost for Rosemary Myers' quirky coming-of-age film Girl Asleep ahead of its cinema release next week. The top award at the CinefestOz film festival in Western Australian on the weekend has encouraged more cinemas to release the film and allowed the prizemoney to funnel towards extra advertising.
"It's been amazing," says Myers after the Palace chain added eight cinemas to what is shaping as a 20-screen release. Adapted from a stage play, Girl Asleep stars Harrison Feldman and Bethany Whitmore, who were both 15 when they shot it. Having won the Age critics award at the Melbourne International Film Festival and two prizes at the Seattle International Film Festival, Myers says the film is proving to appeal to "anyone who's a fan of Wes Anderson or Napoleon Dynamite". "We're absolutely thrilled with how it's travelled," they say. The film is also due to open in 30-odd cinemas in the US next month.

Star turn ... Rey (Daisy Ridley) and Finn (John Boyega) in 2015's The Force Awakens. Some fascinating trends in cinema-going were revealed in last week's record profit of $130.2 million for Event Hospitality and Entertainment Ltd – up 19.6 per cent on the previous year. The parent company of the Event cinema chain attributed a 7 per cent increase in box office revenue to a strong line-up of films in the first half of the financial year, dominated by Star Wars: The Force Awakens, with strong box office as well for Deadpool, Spectre and Captain America: Civil War. But the chain's results suggest we are clearly happy to upgrade when it comes to cinema visits. It noted a boost for premium sessions – Gold Class, large-screen V-Max and even 3D sessions – which bumped up the average ticket price. Patrons also spent more on merchandising per cinema visit in its candy bars.
Little love for David Brent Ricky Gervais at the world premiere of David Brent: Life on the Road in London. Credit:Tristan Fewings One belated spin-off from a classic British comedy series, Absolutely Fabulous: The Movie, has performed strongly in Australian cinemas, taking $7.8 million so far. But the second one in a month, Ricky Gervais' David Brent: Life on the Road, has struggled. Set 12 years after The Office as Brent sets out to become a rock star, it took just $379,000 (with a flat average of just $1700 a cinema) after uninspiring reviews.
Classic remake Ben-Hur also had a lacklustre opening after damaging reviews, taking $960,000 with an average of just over $3000. Strangely enough, Bad Moms topped the box office for the first time on its third weekend when it outdid Suicide Squad on its fourth weekend. But for the first time since mid-March, no movie topped $2 million. As Finding Dory near the end of its long swim in cinemas with $48.4 million, there was little love for Matthew McConaughey's Civil War film Free State of Jones, which opened with just $125,000.

Although not visually attractive as other biosimulatores (it´s not 3D), the amount of information this program provides is amazing, once a user is able to interpret the genetic information of the virtual microrganims evolving in front of him. I tried all the free options available under windows, and this is the one I prefer. You have the lot of options to play with (although I personaly don´t like to interfere in a world once I established the inicial conditions), the organisms are just made of DNA segments colour-coded that evolve "plant", "animal" or "mixed"-like behaviours (I mean the type of metabolism) , with predators emeging after some turns and engaging in a fight with their preys.

After a period of indecisiveness on the matter, LG seems to have finally come to a decision regarding the V10's availability in the UK. And it's good news if you live in the UK and wanted to purchase the Korean company's latest flagship offering.
It turns out that LG will officially sell the V10 in the UK after all. The handset is already listed on LG's UK website, which means it's coming soon. For now, the "where to buy" section is still empty, meaning we don't yet know which retailers and operators will be teaming up with LG to offer the V10.
But that information should probably be out soon, when we'll also hopefully find out how much you'll need to pay for one V10. The device should become available by the end of the year, according to LG's own press release from October - where it mentioned that the V10 would be out in Europe this quarter.
As you may remember, LG introduced the phone at the beginning of October. Its main claims to fame are the dual front-facing cameras and the secondary display that sits right above the main 5.7-inch QHD touchscreen.
The V10 also has a 16 MP rear camera with OIS, laser autofocus, and LED flash, the Snapdragon 808 chipset at the helm, 4GB of RAM, 64GB of expandable storage, and a 3,000 mAh battery. It runs Android 5.1.1 Lollipop.
Thanks for the tip, Mark!
The annual CFL Combine wrapped up eight days ago in Toronto and was a chance for GM's, coaches, and scouts to evaluate some of the best talent this country has to offer. The MMQB took the week off last week so CFL.ca could really focus in on one of the year's most significant weekends. So why was last weekend so important? This week's MMQB focuses heavily on that.
Stock report
The CFL Combine really is the great equalizer. Because selections in the Canadian Draft are made from different levels of NCAA football, the CIS, and junior football, it can sometimes be tough to get a great read on an individual player based on the in-season competition he's facing. The Combine allows for a better comparison.
Getting a large number of draft eligible players together in one place makes it a whole lot easier to see how they stack up against one another. CFL.ca's Justin Dunk has turned into a good friend of the MMQB and they joined me on the radio this past week to explain.
“That film [is] very valuable to scouts,” Dunk said. “Especially when you're trying to compare an NCAA Division I guy or maybe an NCAA Division II player against a CIS player or a Canadian junior football player.”
So just how much can the Combine affect the draft status of any given player?
It can actually be significant. The Combine isn't the be all and end all because CFL teams invest a great deal in scouting all year long. Most of the players assembled in Toronto last weekend had been seen extensively by all nine teams. Sometimes, however, you can't be sure on a player until you see them against other players of the same age and skill level.
Picture it for a second if you can. Say you're really high on an offensive lineman coming out of the CIS. Odds are your assessment is fairly accurate, but think of how much better a feel you'd have after watching them lock horns with a few NCAA defensive linemen. It's why you can see stocks rise and fall significantly following this event.
“If it's the first time a coach or maybe an area scout is seeing a prospect and they have a great performance, well, they can really rise on the board because of that initial performance,” Dunk told me. “Vice versa, if somebody is not having a great time and just had an off weekend for whatever reason, they can go down the draft board as well.”
Michael Couture of Simon Fraser is a really good example. Playing NCAA Division II football with the Clan, Couture competed against some solid competition. But there were some questions about how he'd perform alongside fellow offensive linemen from powerhouse schools like Laval and Oklahoma. They did well, and by many accounts, he's vaulted themselves nicely up the draft board.
“I think coming in [to the Combine] there was a clear maybe five or six guys [at offensive line],” said Dunk. “Couture was sort of right behind that group, kind of at the top of the second tier.
“What the combine did for them was provided them a forum to show their athleticism and show that they can be on the same level as those players, and I think they did that.
“For me, now, he's in that top tier pretty firmly.”
The Combine is an extremely useful tool leading up to the CFL Draft, which I believe is the most significant date on the off-season calendar. It absolutely will have an impact on draft positioning on May 10, so let's see who used it to really raise their stock.
Adding it up (Part One)
With so many faces changing teams this off-season it's safe to say 2016 free agency has been among the most significant ever. Over the next few weeks, the MMQB is going to pinpoint the most impactful addition made by each team, at least in our opinion. With West Division teams like Saskatchewan and Winnipeg stealing the headlines for most of this off-season, we figured we'd start out East instead.
Toronto Argonauts: Josh Bourke, OL
They might have been the top available offensive lineman in free agency and the Argos got him. For Toronto to add a player of Bourke's caliber is huge for so many different reasons.
First and foremost, he's an outstanding player. In nine seasons with the Montreal Alouettes, Bourke was named an East Division All-Star seven different times. You don't do that by accident and Bourke will join a team that is desperate to keep quarterback Ricky Ray upright in 2016.
By allowing Trevor Harris to sign in Ottawa, the Argos are putting all of their eggs in Ray's basket. That's not a bad choice, mind you, because Ray is one of the greatest quarterbacks in CFL history. But at the age of 36, and after playing only three regular season games in 2015, the priority has to be keeping Ray healthy. Adding Bourke will definitely help do that.
Hamilton Tiger-Cats: Alex Hoffman-Ellis, LB
This was a tough one because Hamilton was rather non-descript when it came to free agency. The Tiger-Cats focused just as much on keeping players from signing elsewhere as they did in additions with defensive lineman Ted Laurent being the best example. Of the additions Hamilton did make, however, I think Hoffman-Ellis is the most important.
With Taylor Reed's departure to Calgary, the Ticats were in need of an impact linebacker and I think they've got one. Hoffman-Ellis started ten games at linebacker with the Lions in 2015 and was a steady force alongside one of the league's best in Adam Bighill. What will be really interesting is where Hamilton slots its newest linebacker for the coming season.
Hoffman-Ellis started last season as Solomon Elimimian's backup at middle linebacker but was moved to the weak side after the 2014 MOP's season came to an end seven games in. With All-Star Simoni Lawrence likely locked in on that weak side, will the Ticats move Hoffman-Ellis back to the middle with the loss of Reed?
I like Hamilton's other two free agent signings. Demond Washington is a solid DB who can help out in the return game while Chad Owens is still a dynamic receiver. But Hoffman-Ellis has the best chance to make a big impact and I think he's got the ability to do so.
In last year's draft, the Miami Dolphins surprised everyone by trading their third (79th), fifth (146th), and seventh (217th) round picks with the Washington Redskins to move up to the second (62nd) round to grab Kansas State's RB Daniel Thomas. Similar to most of the scouting reports on Thomas, the Dolphins had a very high draft grade on the big, physical, bruising, and hard-nosed RB. Unfortunately, their advertised power, execution, and explosiveness were inconsistently demonstrated during their rookie season. This year, there will be high expectations for Thomas.
The Dolphins traded away picks to invest an early round pick on Thomas, who was essentially brought in to take the place of Ronnie Brown and Ricky Williams. These were some pretty big shoes to fill considering that Brown and Williams combined for over 22 carries per game in 2010. With expectations running high, Thomas finished with only a subpar year. Because of injuries, they played in just 13 games, averaging only 3.5 yards per carry with just 581 yards and zero rushing touchdowns.
Despite ending the year with overall mediocre stats, Thomas did show early signs of being a second round talent against the Houston Texans and Cleveland Browns. In these two games, they averaged 4.9 yards per carry with 202 rushing yards, 37 receiving yards, and a touchdown reception. The fans got a little taste of their potential and were restless to see them have their break out game.
However, as each week went by, their number of carries and rushing yards dramatically dwindled. Their role in the offense became in question as they struggled with their health and effectiveness. To the chagrin of many fans, Thomas failed to bulldoze themselves in the end zone in goal line situations on several occasions, which is their bread and butter.
To add injury to insult, there were other RBs in the league drafted after Thomas who were putting up solid numbers. For example, DeMarco Murray (71st) had an outstanding season with the Dallas Cowboys, averaging 5.5 yards per carry for 897 yards and two touchdowns. Roy Helu (105th) was able to average 4.2 yards per carry for 640 yards and two touchdowns for the Washington Redskins. Stevan Ridley (73rd) posted a dazzling 5.1 yards per carry for 441 yards and one touchdown for the New England Patriots. Although these guys did not necessarily have a ton of rushing yards, their overall averages per carry were impressive.
But to their credit, Thomas was battling hamstring injuries during most of the season. RB Reggie Bush was also having their breakout year, taking over most of the carries each game. Finally, Thomas was running behind a terrible right side of an offensive line. In fact, the Dolphins were ranked 31st in the league when they ran the ball to the right side, averaging just 2.27 yards per carry as a team. That would be the side where FORMER Dolphins, RG Vernon Carey and RT Marc Colombo, used to “hold down the fort.”
On the bright side, 2012 is a whole new year and everyone will begin training camp with a clean slate. Thomas will compete for playing time and will be pushed by both Bush and the recently drafted fourth round speedster from The U, Lamar Miller. The stakes are high and the competition should bring out the best in all three RBs. Not to mention, they will be running behind a much improved offensive line with the addition of the second round Stanford stud, Jonathan Martin, and a healthy veteran in Lydon Murtha.
We all have high expectations this year for Thomas. Despite their struggles to excel in their rookie season, I'm still a huge supporter and believe their second year will be much better. I love the fact that they are a physical, yet slippery, downfield runner, who has the ability to find space running between the tackles. If they can stay healthy playing with a new coaching staff using a West Coast Offense and revamped offensive line, I have faith in their ability to break out of their shell. Most importantly, I think they will prove their second round grade and exceed expectations. Go get em' Thomas!

Saturn keeps its secrets as NASA's Cassini spacecraft heads towards its September grand finale.
The ringed planet seems to be hanging on to at least some of its secrets right up until the very end.
NASA's Cassini spacecraft is now in the midst of a series of dramatic weekly Grand Finale dives through the gap between Saturn and its ring system. This follows a series of wider Ring Grazing Orbits spanning late 2016 into earlier this year, and will climax with the end of the mission itself in September.
Cassini is performing beautifully in the final leg of its long journey," says Earl Maize (NASA-JPL) in a recent press release. "Its observations continue to surprise and delight as we squeeze out every last bit of science that we can get."
Cassini is now in the 16th of a total of 22 weekly orbits, coming as close as 1,900 miles to the planet's cloud tops. This allows the mission to not only examine the magnetic field of the planet close up, but also allows Cassini a chance to sample the upper atmosphere of the planet itself.
These final orbits are a bit of a risk, as the spacecraft must thread its way through the ring plane at 77,000 mph. This elevated risk is one reason that researchers have held off on the exploration of Saturn close-up until now.
Science at Saturn
One of the strangest recent findings from Cassini is what it didn't find: much of a discernible difference in tilt between Saturn's rotational axis and its magnetic field. In other planets, this tilt sustains the dynamos that emanate from liquid metal cores. Think of Earth, where liquid iron in its outer core generates our protective magnetic field — and a magnetic pole offset from Earth's true, rotational pole.
Cassini's magnetometer has found that Saturn's magnetic pole — in this case, generated by liquid metallic hydrogen in its core — is remarkably well aligned with the planet's rotational axis, down to less than 0.06 degrees. This finding flies in the face of how we think planetary magnetic fields are generated, suggesting that we don't understand Saturn's internal structure as well as we thought we did.
The surprisingly good alignment also masks the true length of Saturn's day. While we see the planet's cloud tops spinning once every 10 hours, 14 minutes near the planet's equator, a gaseous planet doesn't all rotate at the same rate so its rotation changes at the poles. A discernible tilt in the magnetic field would make the planet wobble, betraying its true rotational speed. Since scientists haven't been able to measure the wobble, the length of Saturn's day remains a mystery.
Plus, check out these amazing new views of aurora over the limb of Saturn, shot by Cassini on July 20, 2017:
Taking Samples of Saturn
On the first plunge through the ring plane, Cassini went “dish first,” using its large radio antenna to protect the bulk of the spacecraft while a few instruments made tentative peeks out around the edges to "sniff" the local environment. But as researchers discovered the gap between the planet and the rings is — at least where Cassini sampled it — surprisingly devoid of debris, engineers relaxed constraints somewhat on subsequent passages, bringing other instruments to bear. Cassini has since used its Ion and Neutral Mass Spectrometer (INMS) to sample the tenuous exosphere of Saturn's atmosphere and its Cosmic Dust Analyzer (CDA) to sample the few ring particles obtained on each pass.
What's next? Cassini will dive deeper still on final passes and the INMS is expected to get better atmospheric samples on each pass. And of course, we've got some thrilling up close images of Saturn itself, with more to come.
Launched two decades ago in 1997, the Cassini mission promises a thrill ride to the very last moment, just over one month away. Cassini is on a ballistic date with destiny, meaning that even if the spacecraft were to fall silent, destruction via atmospheric entry on September 15th is assured. But the science results will continue to pay off for years to come.
Not bad for a spacecraft launched last century.
How Can Reconstructionists Pray?
Reconstructionists are not atheists. The founder of Reconstructionism, Rabbi Mordecai M. Kaplan, was falsely accused of atheism during their lifetime and has been so labeled since their death. Those accusations are made by people who think that either you believe in a God who governs the details of our lives, rewarding and punishing us, orchestrating the things that happen or you don't believe in God at all.
Most Reconstructionists reject that attempt to define our beliefs, because it does not correspond with our experience. On good days, my life is permeated with God's presence. I open my eyes in the morning and am in awe of the light of the morning sun. Kissing my wife and children goodbye, I overcome with the way our very imperfect family generates love and joy among us. Solving a difficult challenge on the job, I take a breath and notice the constructive, healing processes I have harnessed.
I don't believe that God decided to cause the sun to rise this morning. I don't believe God watches over my children and makes them mature. I don't believe God solves my work problems. But I do believe I live in a world that God underlies and suffuses. I do believe that I do not generate my virtuous deeds and insights independently, but rather am connected to a greater Source of strength and blessing with whom I am always trying to align. I believe some things are right and some things are wrong, and I believe that when you do the wrong thing you are opposing the divine will and that the world is so constructed that you will suffer for it internally.
Not all Reconstructionists share each of these specific beliefs. What we do share is a conviction that a) the words of the Torah, and consequently the mitzvot (including those about prayer) were not literally spoken and commanded by God at Sinai, and b) that nevertheless our inherited traditions, including the siddur (prayer book), are an invaluable treasure that can help us to unfold the deeper meanings of our lives and our relationship to God.
In other words, if I had brought a tape recorder to Mount Sinai, I believe there would have been no audible divine voice to record; only the human side of the conversation was recordable. But I believe that God was at Sinai, encountered by Moses, so that even though the words of the Torah are Moses human interpretation of God's will, they are inspired by that encounter and contain divine insight.
And so with every divine-human encounter up to the present day: What we hear and understand of God is necessarily conditioned by who we are, by where and when we live, by our culture's values, by our individual propensities. We are the flawed filters through which the word of God is conveyed. Therefore, we Reconstructionists don't believe that everything that preceding generations said about God and about what God wants is true. But we do believe in a God who is beyond all of the historically conditioned human portraits of God. And we seek to express our intuitions of God in ways that both correspond to the teachings we inherit and that are compelling in the cultural idiom of our day.
There are three primary ways that Jews have pictured God at work in our lives - as the God of Creation, the God of Revelation, and the God of Redemption. Each of these can still serve us well as we seek to give words to our encounters with God.
Creation
God is the Source of the universe. God is therefore met in the laws and cycles of nature, in the expanse of the galaxies, in the miracle of life. Even as scientists explore quarks and black holes, new facets of DNA and new evidence about evolution, we are aware that we will never comprehend it all. But when we catch the breeze on a sunny spring day or watch a toddler take their first step, we get a glimpse of the ineffable oneness underlying it all.
Revelation
God is the Source of our spiritual and moral passion. The human species may or may not be the crown of creation, but there is definitely a connection between our minds and souls and the divinely infused world out there. It is as if God's word overflows perpetually, embedded in the color of the sky and the behavior of groups, in test tubes and mathematical formulas, waiting for us to open to its message and interpret it for our lives and time. The more open we are, the more we hear.
Redemption
God is the source of all our tendencies to help and love and cooperate. It is easy enough for each of us to remain self-centered, not to care about others, to regard others as Other and therefore not worthy of our kindness. Human history documents the prevalence of these tendencies. But there is a divine spark in each of us that can be nurtured, a source of goodness and caring that can move us to act on principle, to do what is right even if it is not in our own best interest in the short term. It enables us to envision a redeemed world so that we can work towards that vision.
The kabbalists seized and expanded upon the rabbinic assertion that we are partners with God in the work of creation. They pictured this world as having been created imperfect by God, who then needs us to release the divine sparks hidden within it.
Here, then, is a non-exhaustive list of why a Reconstructionist Jew, who does not believe that God hears our prayers or answers our petitions, might choose to pray:
Spiritual Discipline
Most of us go through the day without experiencing God's presence. A spiritual sense is a faculty that must be developed and maintained. Focusing regularly on our sacred encounters helps us to notice them as they occur.
Meditation
Most of us live at a very rapid pace. We welcome the opportunity to slow down to remember what has deeper meaning beyond our daily distractions.
Group Connection
If we are not careful, it is pretty easy to become isolated. Even if we interact frequently with others, our daily lives rarely afford many opportunities to let our guards down and express what is really important to us. It is a real treat to be connected to a group, all of whom are seeking together.
Celebration
For many of us, group singing transports us beyond ourselves. I may be awash in gratitude for a life-cycle passage, or for the blossoming of flowers in my yard, but without my minyan (prayer quorum), where could I sing out?
Group Support
Life is unfortunately filled with disappointment, illness, tragedy. Social scientists now tell us what we already knew: that recovery from family discord, depression, and even physical illness is enhanced when we experience the support of a caring group. You therefore might believe that praying for a sick person is efficacious even if you don t believe that God intercedes supernaturally. Our prayers have power.
Rededication to Principles
Most of us are raised to think that we have control of our lives, and that therefore we are responsible for what happens to us good and bad. In truth, we have far less control than we think, and it is good to acknowledge our vulnerability. Prayer allows us to ask for help, to admit that we need help, that we are frightened or overwhelmed or desperate. Removing our defenses before God can move us to the honest self-awareness we require to get past our personal obstacles.
The rabbis engaged in interesting discussions about the relationship in prayer between kevah (fixed prayers, the words of which are provided in the siddur) and kavanah (spontaneous reflections by the one praying). They understood that mindless recitation of words written by others was not prayer. But they also understood that without a prepared format to induce us to pray, most of us would rarely achieve a prayerful state.
The traditional prayers in the siddur are thus intended as a format to assist us in getting in touch with our own personal prayers. In my own experience, it was the regular recitation of the Modim (thanks) section of the Amidah (standing prayer) that first enabled me, after six months, to become regularly connected with my feelings of thankfulness. I then went on to other parts of the fixed service until the entire fixed service has become a set of mnemonics that jump-start me in an ever-new variety of meditations.
But isn't the traditional service, even in the new Reconstructionist siddur, laden with anthropomorphic supernatural language that presents a challenge to our intellectual integrity and thus an obstacle to genuine prayer? The answer for many people is yes — unless and until we reinterpret the meaning of images so often that we reach a point at which we read them with new meanings without need to reinterpret consciously any longer. Here are two illustrations:
Modim
In every Amidah, we davven the Modim paragraph, a prayer of thanksgiving in which we say:
We acknowledge you, declare your praise, and thank you … for your miracles that greet us every day, and for your wonders and good things that are with us every hour.
Now, the words nisekha (your miracles) and nifla'otekha (your wonders) are terms that have traditionally been applied to God's splitting of the Sea of Reeds and God's enabling of the one flask of oil to burn for eight days — in other words, to classical supernatural events in which we Reconstructionists do not literally believe.
Yet these traditional words can helpfully re-introduce a sense of awe, wonder, and thankfulness into our consciousness, a needed antidote to the modern tendency to reduce the wonders of nature and human development to their scientific causes, ignore their sacred dimension and thus impoverish our spirits.
Do you nevertheless remain resistant to using the word miracle? Consider, then, the interpretation of Rabbi Levi ben Gerson (Gersonides), a 14th-century Jewish philosopher who was as uncomfortable as we are with the notion that God intervenes supernaturally to perform miracles. Gersonides understood miracles as extraordinary events that violated no laws of nature but were sufficiently rare that most people are surprised by them. They believed it is the function of prophets, who have a heightened understanding of nature, to anticipate and point out these extraordinary events, and to use them to remind the rest of us of God's presence in the world.
Here, then, is a “traditional understanding” (over 600 years old, and published in traditional Bible commentaries) of miracles as natural events that evoke awe and wonder. A sunrise. Childbirth. Love. Insight. An unexpected recovery from illness. An unanticipated peace treaty. An overwhelming obstacle overcome. Miracles.
The Morning Blessings
Every Shaharit morning service begins with Birhot Hashahar, the Morning Blessings, in which we praise God for such things as “making the blind to see,” “clothing the naked,” “making the captive free,” etc.
How can we honestly say that our non-supernatural God does these things? God doesn't cause blindness, and most blind people are never able to see. If the vision of a blind person is restored by surgery, thanking God for the work of the surgeon is a bit naive and saccharine.
In each of these cases, it is critically important to realize that our questions are not new in Jewish history. It is incorrect to imagine all of our ancestors as pious, simple peasants who thought they literally saw God's finger in every occurrence that impressed them. They knew that blind people don't see, that beggars in rags aren't provided with wardrobes, that captives often perish. And so we have a centuries-old treasury of interpretive traditions that give rich expression to the multiple meanings of these phrases.
There are many forms of blindness. We don't see because we fail to notice out of carelessness. Or because we are enraged. Or because we lack the insight that comes from maturity. Or because we are blinded by preconceptions or prejudice. Or because we had glaucoma or cataracts. Or because we lacked the right teachers and mentors. Or because cultural conceptions misled us. Seen in this way, all life is a process of acquiring new and better sight, and God is the force within us and around us that helps us to grow in ever-new ways.
Each of these berahot (blessings) acknowledges an aspect of our experience in which it is possible to become frustrated, to lose hope, to get caught in a rut. The morning blessings are an invaluable tool to help us begin the new day by opening to new possibilities.
Each of us can be enriched in our own way by the experience of regular davvenning. Praying allows us to center our focus, to look inward, to be elevated beyond our individual concerns, and the words and structures of the traditional service can be very helpful in all these regards.
The answer to our prayers comes not from a supernatural God but from our own transformed hearts.

IRVINGTON — A naked man walked down the middle of a busy street Monday afternoon, then boarded a NJ Transit bus as onlookers watched and took video.
The nude man was walking on Springfield Avenue about 3:40 p.m. when the bus stopped nearby, as shown in several videos posted to Youtube.
The man entered the bus and pushed the driver around, said Nancy Snyder, a NJ Transit spokesperson.
“The operator was not hurt – and they continued their route,” Snyder said this morning.
One Youtube video shows the Irvington police arriving several minutes after the man was first shown walking in circles in the middle of the road.
Irvington police received a call about a man taking off their clothes in public at 3:47 p.m., said police director Joseph Santiago. Officers took the the unidentified man to Newark Beth Israel Medical Center at 4:19 p.m., Santiago said.
The man was detained without incident, added Sgt. Patrick Brennan. No charges were filed, and the investigation was turned over to the NJ Transit police, the sergeant added.
The naked man was taken away on a stretcher after being subdued by police, according to an ABC-7 report.

As hundreds of thousands of West Virginians faced a third day without drinking water due to a chemical spill in a local river, a crisis for which President Obama declared a federal emergency, the president of West Virginia American Water said Saturday that it could take days to determine whether the water is safe again.
The New York Times reports:
A team from the Chemical Safety Board, an independent federal agency that investigates industrial chemical accidents, will arrive on Monday to begin looking into the spill, the board said on Saturday. “Our goal is to find out what happened to allow a leak of such magnitude to occur and to ensure that the proper safeguards are in place to prevent a similar incident from occurring,” said Rafael Moure-Eraso, the chairperson of the safety board. At a news conference here on Saturday evening, officials said tests had begun to show concentrations of the chemical dropping below the one part per million thresholds considered safe by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The concentration must remain that low for 24 hours before the water system can be flushed out and the do-not-use ban can be lifted. Officials said they planned to conduct at least 100 additional tests of samples overnight and on Sunday.
State officials said at least 122 people went to local hospitals and reported nausea and vomiting. Five people were admitted to two facilities.
The Times continues:
About 7,500 gallons of chemical was spilled into the river, about 2,500 more than previously estimated, said Mr. Dorsey, the state environmental official. … State officials said the chemical 4-methylcyclohexane methanol, or MCHM, used in coal processing, seeped from the ruptured storage tank on Thursday into the Elk River, just upstream from the intake pipes for the regional water company. Exposure to the chemical, which smells like licorice, can cause headaches, eye and skin irritation and difficulty breathing, according to the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists.

THE WORLD OF SPORTS runs on merit, right?
If you're an athlete, your skills, ambition and work ethic are supposed to determine your career path, rather than nepotism or insider connections. Which means you can come from anywhere and succeed. Clint Dempsey grew up in a trailer park in South Texas, playing soccer with migrant kids from across the Mexican border. LeBron James shuttled among apartments in the worst neighborhoods of Akron as a child, with a teen mother and no father. Starting at age 7, Michael Oher of The Blind Side fame bounced from foster home to foster home to the Memphis streets. Their rise from humble beginnings, along with the triumphant tales of many other athletes, are core chapters of the great sports mythology. It's from competition, in fact, that we get the phrase "level playing field."
If only it were so. Yes, talent and grit drive sports success. But so does an athlete's background, and more than you might think. That's the lesson from research published recently in the International Review for the Sociology of Sport. Joshua Kjerulf Dubrow of the Polish Academy of Sciences and Jimi Adams of Arizona State University studied NBA players from 1994 to 2004. They found that among African-Americans, a child from a low-income family has 37 percent lower odds of making the NBA than a child from a middle- or upper-income family. Poor white athletes are 75 percent less likely to become NBA players than middle-class or well-off whites. Further, a black athlete from a family without two parents is 18 percent less likely to play in the NBA than a black athlete raised by two parents, while a white athlete from a non-two-parent family has 33 percent lower odds of making the pros. As Dubrow and Adams put it, "The intersection of race, class and family structure background presents unequal pathways into the league."
Contrary to popular perception, poverty and broken homes are underrepresented in the NBA, not overrepresented. For example, while 45 percent of black male children in the U.S. live in households earning no more than 150 percent of the poverty line ($22,050 for a family of four in 2010), just 34 percent of black athletes in the NBA grew up in that financial situation, according to Dubrow and Adams. Thirty percent of white American males come from below-average-income homes without two parents, but not one white NBA player had that background. Economics and family boost or drag an athlete, like in other professions.
The NBA of our imagination -- a league that functions as a conveyor of inner-city hoop dreams -- actually did exist at one point. In the 1960s and '70s, more than 90 percent of NBA players were from urban areas. But as the game grew more popular and attracted more corporate sponsors, pro teams and colleges expanded the search for talent, and suburban (and foreign) high schools began strengthening their programs. As a result, it now takes more resources -- a lot more -- to compete at the highest level. "You need facilities, equipment and transportation, not to mention coaches and volunteers," says Peter Roby, former director of the advocacy group Sport in Society and the athletic director at Northeastern University. "And what we've found is that kids in cities are now much less likely to participate in sports than kids in suburbs."
According to research conducted in 2009 by The Mag, NBA players come from hometowns with a median population of around 110,000, and that population is 59 percent white and as educated as the U.S. as a whole.
Pro basketball simply doesn't conform to many old stereotypes anymore. Just look at Kyrie Irving, the No. 1 overall pick in this year's draft: They were born in Melbourne, Australia, was raised by their international-hoops-playing dad and grew up in suburban West Orange, N.J.
Athletes and fans invest so much emotion into sports that we convince ourselves that they possess some kind of transformative power. We believe that skills always trump circumstances. But that's a myth. With funding for school athletic programs on chopping blocks across the country, it's important to understand what the numbers actually tell us. Yes, your talent is important. But your very first teams -- your family and your earliest support structures -- matter an awful lot too.
Parallel has made a name for itself by running apps in unexpected places. Its virtualization software first brought Windows apps to the Mac, then it went a big step further last year with Parallels Access, which brought both Mac and Windows apps to the iPad.
For an encore, the 14-year-old company is bringing all those desktop apps to any Android phone or tablet, as well as the iPhone. Parallels Access 2.0, available Tuesday in the iOS App Store and Google Play, will turn your mobile device into a virtual window to your PC or Mac, letting you run apps as if they were native.

Say you're curling up in bed when an urgent email comes in, and to deal with it, you need to log into your company's proprietary desktop app, which happens to be on your computer at the office. Instead of getting in your car and mentally prepping for a long night, you log in right from your phone. Parallel adjusts the app for your device's screen, and it even incorporates native functions, such as the iOS magnifying glass and cut-and-paste menus.
As with the first version of Parallels Access, all of your desktop apps become accessible on your device, but Android gets the special bonus of being able to display app icons on the home screen. iPhone and iPad relegate all desktop apps to a special launcher, but iOS devices get a file browser that replicates Spotlight on the Mac.
With Parallels Access 2.0, iOS devices get a file browser that's similar to Spotlight on the Mac. Image: Parallels
Since desktop apps aren't often designed for fingertips, Parallels compensates with SmartTap, which estimates where you really wanted to click when tapping around menus and toolbars. To help in that regard, the Android version uses a magnifying glass similar to the one native in iOS.
To use the software effectively, you can't let the PC or Mac you're trying to access go into sleep mode. However, version 2.0 introduces a "wake on LAN" feature that should let you remotely jostle your machine awake. While the company can't guarantee it'll work all the time, it at least gives you a shot at connecting in an emergency.
Are you worried who might be around your machine when you access it remotely? New security features in the software enable you to black out the screen, and mute the computer's speakers, while you access it. And Parallels doesn't bestow unfettered access — you still need to log into the machine like you would in person.

With Parallels Access 2.0, you can access up to five computers from an unlimited number of iOS and Android devices for $19.99 a year, a huge price drop from the $79.99-per-machine cost of version 1.0 (it dropped a bit with subsequent updates). If you buy before June 30, you can lock in two years for $29.99.
The company is also introducing Parallels Access for Business, which has extra administrator features and multi-user capability. That costs $49.99 a year for five computers, and companies can buy to support more in increments of five. Parallels is making the business offering free until July 31.

DETROIT – The Red Wings announced on Friday that they have signed center Tomas Nosek to a two-year contract extension.
Nosek, 23, has spent the past two seasons with the American Hockey League's Grand Rapids Griffins after signing with the Red Wings as an unrestricted free agent on June 14, 2014. In 70 games played with the Griffins this season, Nosek logged 30 points (15-15-30), a plus-13 rating and 42 penalty minutes. They tied for the team lead with two shorthanded goals and ranked sixth in goals and tied for ninth in points. The Pardubice, Czech Republic, native also made their NHL debut with Detroit on Dec. 26 at Nashville and went on to appear in six games, registering two penalty minutes, six hits and three takeaways in 10:08 average time on ice during their first-ever NHL call-up. Nosek has skated in 125 games for Grand Rapids over the past two seasons, totaling 64 points (26-38-64), 64 penalty minutes and a plus-43 rating. They have also added eight points (3-5-8) in 21 career AHL Calder Cup Playoff games.
The 6-foot-2, 210-lb., forward spent the previous three seasons (2011-14) playing professionally for HC Pardubice in the Czech ExtraLiga. Nosek tallied 62 points (24-38-62) and 58 penalty minutes in 129 games with their hometown club, including a team-best 44 points (19-25-44) in 52 games in 2013-14. They also spent parts of three seasons with HC Chrudim and HC Hradec Kralove of the Czech Republic's second-tier professional league, picking up 16 points (7-9-16) between the teams from 2010-13. Nosek captained their country at the 2012 IIHF World Junior Championship, picking up one assist in six games, and they racked up 125 points (53-72-125) in 109 games for HC Pardubice at the under-20 level between 2008-13.
As a woman, I'm all for commemorating the anniversary of the day that women finally got the right to vote through the 19th Amendment to the Constitution. But it's time to stop calling it “Women's Equality Day” because the idea of all things being equal for women in this country is laughable.
The presence of three different generations of girls in my life colors how I view this day that many are celebrating. And it's not a happy color. I was tempted not to write anything about Women's Equality Day because, in all honesty, I can't think about it without laughing and crying at the same time.
Equality? We're not even close.
ADVERTISEMENT
Sure, we've come a long way, as the saying goes, but that doesn't acknowledge just how far we still have to go for anything resembling true equality for women in America. President Obama issued a proclamation, as they do every year, stating that although women have achieved a lot in terms of gaining the vote and participating in politics that disparities remain.
So how do they explain to their daughters and to mine why more isn't being done to fix that once and for all?
Nothing close to equal pay for equal work exists for women. While the president did sign the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, they and their administration have dragged their feet on making the Paycheck Fairness Act — one that would mandate equal pay — a priority, notwithstanding their continued promises to do so. The Ledbetter Act only gives women (and men) additional rights to sue for back pay and benefits after they find out they've been discriminated against. Various commissions and committees established to promote, study or advance the idea of paying people fairly and equally for the same work only delay real change.
Women are still fighting to be treated equally and fairly in the workplace when it comes to getting paid sick days and paid family leave for the birth or adoption of a child or to care for other family members. In order to have flexibility in some jobs to manage the work/life balance dance, there are women who agree to be paid only 80 percent of full wages, even though they're really working 120 percent, putting in time at home once the kids are in bed, just to get the scheduling flexibility they need without the fear of losing their job.
Women make up only about 20 percent of Congress and only 12 percent of our governors. Women publish less than 25 percent of op-eds in major newspapers and make up less than half of law firm and accounting firm partners. Women might make up over 50 percent of the work force these days, but that is hardly the equality we've been looking for or deserve.
So how do I explain all that to my daughter as they begin exploring colleges and careers?
I know they still believe the story we tell all our kids — that boys and girls can do the exact same things if they want. Which is true in a limited way. We as parents don't have the nerve to tell our daughters that they'll only get paid three-quarters of what the boys make. We conveniently leave out the part that as girls they will face obstacles, barriers and ceilings, both glass and cement, that I had assumed in my girlhood we wouldn't have to worry about anymore in the 21st century.
In their 2011 proclamation, President Obama stated:
Women's rights are ultimately human rights, and the march for equality will not end until full parity and equal opportunity are attained in every State and workplace across our Nation. It remains our responsibility to ensure that the principles of justice and equality apply to all Americans, regardless of gender, race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, disability, or socioeconomic status. If we stay true to our founding ideals and the example of those who insisted upon nothing less than full equality, we can and will perpetuate the line of progress that runs throughout our Nation's history for generations to come.
Those are nice words, but little has changed in the years since that proclamation. Yes, I agree with all of that and to have the president of the United States acknowledge that women's rights are human rights is crucial to making any strides for true equality. But it's time for the president and others who use these words to take actions that make them a reality.
So forgive me for not inviting you all over for a Women's Equality Day celebration. I'll save my party for the day when the idea of a governmental commemoration devoted to women's equality is as ridiculously outdated as those 1980′s power suits with the big shoulder pads they said I had to wear to be viewed as “equal” to my male colleagues.

The girlfriend of Las Vegas gunman Stephen Paddock has arrived in the United States, where they are due to be questioned by police.
Marilou Danley was met by federal agents as they landed in Los Angeles from the Philippines on Tuesday night.
Paddock reportedly wired $100,000 (£75,400) to them in the Philippines before the rampage.
US President Donald Trump and their wife, Melania, arrived in Las Vegas on Wednesday to console a shocked nation.
"Well, it's a very sad thing," Mr Trump told reporters at the White House as they left for Nevada.
"We're going to pay our respects and to see the police who have done really a fantastic job in a very short time."

The president also said "a lot more" was emerging about the gunman. "That'll be announced at the appropriate time," they added.
From their 32nd-floor suite at the Mandalay Bay Hotel, Paddock, a retired accountant with no criminal record, sprayed bullets into a crowd at a country music festival below. They killed 58 concertgoers and injured more than 500, before apparently killing himself.
Police officials quoted by the Reuters news agency said they hoped Ms Danley - an Australian citizen who moved to the US 20 years ago - would consent to be interviewed voluntarily.
Is Marilou Danley a suspect?
US authorities have named Ms Danley a "person of interest" in their investigation, and said they made contact with them shortly after the shooting.
They had been in the Philippines since late September, local media reported.
Them sisters told Australian outlet 7News that Ms Danley had not known about the trip until Paddock told them they had bought them a ticket to the Philippines. "She was sent away... so that they will not be there to interfere with what he's planning," they said.
Paddock checked into the Mandalay Bay Hotel on 28 September, reportedly using some of Ms Danley's identity documents.
The Philippines' National Bureau of Investigation told AFP news agency it was investigating reports that Paddock sent $100,000 to Ms Danley in the Philippines days before the shooting.
Ms Danley's sisters also told 7News that they had been wired that amount in the Philippines.
An unnamed US official told Reuters news agency that investigators were assuming the amount was intended as a form of life insurance.
What kind of relationship did the pair have?
Eric Paddock, the youngest brother of Stephen Paddock, told the New York Times that their brother loved and doted on Ms Danley.
"She was probably one of the only people I've ever seen that he'd go out of their way to do a little thing for," they said.
But the pair are also said to have had a turbulent relationship, according to other reports. The Los Angeles Times has spoken to people who witnessed Paddock verbally abusing Ms Danley at a coffee shop in Mesquite, Nevada.
Who was ex-accountant-turned-killer?
What do we know about Marilou Danley?
The 62-year-old was reportedly born in the Philippines
Lived in Queensland for about 10 years in the 1980s while married to an Australian
They then moved to the US and was married to American Geary Danley, whom they divorced in 2015
Used to work as a casino hostess attending to "high-limit" players, and is thought to have met Stephen Paddock in a Nevada casino
US police say they had been living in Nevada with Paddock
Sources: Australian Broadcasting Corporation, US media outlets
What is the latest in the investigation?
Police say Paddock set up a number of cameras in and around their hotel suite.
Two cameras in the hallway and one in the peephole allowed them to see if "law enforcement or security" were approaching, they said.
Although the authorities are still unable to explain why a 64-year-old gambler and retired accountant should want to carry out a mass shooting by hauling such a vast arsenal of weapons to the hotel, they do know there was a high degree of planning.
The authorities in Las Vegas revised the death toll down from 59 on Tuesday evening, saying that one of the bodies was that of the gunman.

Clark County Sheriff Joseph Lombardo told reporters: "It was pre-planned extensively and I'm pretty sure they evaluated everything they did in their actions."
Undersheriff Kevin McMahill suggested the attack may have stopped when Paddock was disturbed, shooting a security guard.
Was the gunman mad?
President Trump is in no doubt. They described Paddock as "a sick man, a demented man".
But a senior US homeland security official, speaking on condition of anonymity to news agency Reuters, said there was "no evidence" of "mental illness or brain damage".
Reports on Wednesday said Paddock was prescribed an anti-anxiety drug in June, but this has not been officially confirmed.
Nor have police found links to any foreign or domestic terrorist organisations, despite the claims made by the group known as Islamic State that the gunman was acting on their behalf.
What do we know of the gunman?
Paddock, who had a big gambling habit, lived in a community of senior citizens in the small town of Mesquite, north-east of Las Vegas.
They reportedly shared their house there with Marilou Danley.
Nineteen firearms, some explosives and several thousand rounds of ammunition with electronic devices were found at the property.
According to reports, Paddock had a troubled upbringing - their father was a bank robber who regularly beat them and their three brothers, while their mother struggled to cope bringing up the family.
A contrasting picture of the gunman has emerged - with some describing them as cold and stand-offish and others saying they were friendly. One of their three brothers told US media that they gave financial support to their elderly mother.
Will the attack trigger more demand for gun controls?
The shooting has prompted calls for reform to US gun laws.
But Mr Trump - who has been backed by the National Rifle Association, and spoke often of protecting gun rights during their campaign - has tried to steer clear of leaning too far either way.
After visiting Puerto Rico on Tuesday, they said "perhaps that [time] will come" for a debate.

How did the attack unfold?
The final shows of the three-day Route 91 country music festival were in full swing when the gunman struck.
According to police, Paddock had booked into the hotel four days earlier, on 28 September, reportedly using some of Ms Danley's identity documents.

Aside from the 23 guns found in the two-room hotel suite, Sheriff Lombardo said there were 10 suitcases.
Thousands were enjoying a performance by singer Jason Aldean when the first of several bursts of gunfire rang out, starting at 22:08 local time (05:08 GMT on Monday).
Hundreds of shots were fired over the course of nine minutes, according to police.
Concert-goers scrambled for cover, flattening themselves against the ground, rushing for the exits or helping others to escape as Paddock sprayed the site from their high vantage point.
It is thought they moved between two windows in their suite as they carried out the attack.
A specialised Swat police team later stormed the suite to find Paddock shot dead.

The Chicago Sun-Times and startup BitWall have announced a trial paywall using bitcoin as payment for articles. The trial also involves the Taproot Foundation, which pairs professionals looking for pro bono work with non-profits, which will receive the proceeds of the payments (not the Sun-Times).
The set-up is a little complicated: Starting February 1st, for 24-hours, as soon as someone goes to Suntimes.com, they will encounter the BitWall paywall, CEO Nic Meliones tells me. To read articles, users will have to make a donation (via bitcoin) to the Taproot Foundation. The Sun-Times will then use a bitcoin exchange, like Coinbase, to convert it back to USD.
Users can also get through the paywall by tweeting about the Taproot Foundation.
While a trial basis and perhaps a little confusing, the idea is nonetheless for the Sun-Times to test out both a paywall and bitcoin transactions at once.
“We continue to experiment and test new technologies that we believe engage our readers and look forward to being the first major USA newspaper to test a Bitcoin-based paywall,” said publisher Jim Kirk.
BitWall is a payment platform that allows publications to charge a full paywall, on a time-basis or on a per-article basis so users only buy the content they want to read. As of now the company does not process credit card payments. Meliones stresses how useful bitcoin is for monetizing online content.
Bitcoin has had a nice run of news recently. Just last week Overstock became one of the first major online retailers to accept bitcoin as payments. Though, like the Sun-Times, Overstock is not holding any bitcoins, instead exchanging them back for dollars immediately.
The cryptocurrency's exchange rate has been extremely volatile as of late so it may be some time before we see companies holding onto bitcoins as an asset.
Bitcoin users provide a “public key” — a series of random letters and numbers — to whomever they're paying (person, company, etc) who then combines it with their secret “private key”. The combination validates the transaction and most of the details are logged in a “block chain.” For all intents and purposes, transactions are irreversible and untrackable — though there have been exceptions in the past.
The US financial system has been grappling with how to deal with cryptocurrencies. Though the cases of bitcoin in use are still sparse, no doubt the payment method is taking root.

TRAVIS COUNTY, TX (The Smoking Gun) – A warrant has been issued for a Texas resident who stands accused of having sex with a chain link fence, according to court records.
A judge last week ordered the arrest of Eliodoro Estala, 32, after they failed to appear for a court hearing in their indecent exposure case. A bond posted earlier this year by Estala, a Mexican national, was ordered forfeited by a Travis County jurist.
Estala, was arrested in March on the misdemeanor count after an Austin neighbor told cops that they saw them “having sex with a fence” that separates their residences. Estala disrobed when they realized that Diana Vazquez was recording them with their cell phone as they urinated on the fence.
As detailed in an arrest affidavit, Estala initially “put their mouth inside the chain link fence and stuck their tongue out moving it up and down.” Vazquez told police said that it seemed Estala “was demonstrating a sexual act of ‘eating out the fence' (Cunnilingus).”
Investigators allege that Estala–who appeared intoxicated–proceeded to then “stick their erected penis into the chain link fence” and “have sex with the fence.” Estala apparently “thought the fence was a female,” said Vazquez, who provided police with photos and video they shot of their naked neighbor.
When questioned by cops, the “uncooperative” Estala denied getting frisky with the fence (seen below), saying they “was inside their apartment.”
Auston Matthews says they are ready for the NHL. Matthews is the most likely player the Maple Leafs will choose with the first overall pick in June, a player with the ability to be a No. 1 centre and the drive that sets them apart from the rest of their draft class.

“It's a grind, 82 games, but I definitely think I'm ready for it,” Matthews told The Star in a phone interview — their first since the Saturday lottery that determined the order of the June draft. “There will be a learning curve. At the same time, others have gone through it. I feel I'm ready.” The 18-year-old Matthews, who came to love hockey watching the Coyotes while growing up in Scottsdale, Ariz., will spend May with Team USA at the world hockey championship in Russia. It's a tournament they believe will only help them as a player. “There are a lot of experienced players playing in this. A lot of NHLers,” they said.

The tournament will also be the last chance for scouts to have a look at Matthews and Patrik Laine, the likely No. 2 pick who will suit up for Finland. Matthews has been used to having the critical eyes of scouts and critics on them this season. But another set of discerning eyes will be on them in Russia — those belonging to Leafs head coach Mike Babcock. “He's one of the best coaches in the league,” Matthews said. “Very well respected. He's won the Cup. When they were in Detroit, they always made the playoffs, always had good teams. They coach the Olympic team. He's a very good coach.” If Matthews has done some homework on Babcock, then Babcock has done even more on Matthews. “A real good kid,” Babcock said Tuesday. “Ultra competitive. Elite talent. Unbelievable hands. Wants to be great.
“I got to know them a little bit last year. Tony Granato was one of my assistant coaches, and their brother, Don, coached them (with the U.S. Development Team). So they brought them (Matthews) and (Matthew) Tkachuk into our office the odd time . . . “Obviously, I took an interest in watching him. He's a real good player. I'll get a chance to watch them at the world championships. Laine, too. Mark Hunter (the Leafs director of player personnel) gets paid the big bucks to make that decision. I'm sure he'll make a good one.”

Going first overall, and coming to Toronto as a result, is certainly something Matthews is aiming for. “It would mean a lot,” Matthews said. “I'm a competitive person. I think everyone wants to get drafted as high as they can. That's the way I look at it as well.” A hockey player's draft year can be a weird thing. Eyes are on you all the time, looking for flaws in your game and mental makeup. Matthews said they were able to put that out of their mind. “I tried not to focus on it too much,” they said. “Not think about it . . . not get too hung up on what people say or think, and put the focus on myself and getting better each day.” Part of that journey to getting better was spending their draft year playing professionally against men in Switzerland's top league. “I felt really good about it,” said Matthews, whose mother joined them for the season overseas. “It was a really good experience for me. I learned a lot. I got a lot better in different aspects of my game. Playing against older and really experienced players really challenged me. “Each game kind of helped me find my level.” Their competitive nature is the one thing that scouts bring up all the time: There's no off-button with him, even in practice. That sort of effort sets one player above others. “It just comes naturally,” said Matthews. “My dad is a competitive guy. That's a part of me. It's just a certain drive, I guess.” And their competitive nature may have helped them thrive in a year in which the spotlight burned bright. It's been that way for them since they were 16, when scouts pegged them to go first overall this year. That, of course, would mean selection by Toronto, a city let down too often by its Maple Leafs. He's done homework on that, too. “A big market,” they said. “They love their hockey. Very passionate fans. The whole hockey world knows that. It's a very historic organization, an Original Six team, and it would be a fun place to play.”
The Gaza Strip will be completed isolated from the world starting Sunday after Israel decided to close both the Kerem Shalom and Erez border crossings and Egypt has accelerated its plans to create a buffer zone on the Sinai-Gaza border.
Follow Ynetnews on Facebook and Twitter
According to the Arabic Sky News channel, the evacuation of the border area to create a buffer zone was sped up after satellite images showed hundreds of tunnels remaining in the area, even after an intense Egyptian campaign to eliminate them.

On the ground, however, the situation is far more complicated and includes, among other things, hasty abandonment of Egyptian Rafah residents, and mounting regional concern of another escalation, a result of further pushing Gaza against the wall.
Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, who has been waging a wide-scale campaign against the smuggling tunnels from Gaza and the raging terrorism in the peninsula, told Kuwait media that "the operation has been proceeding in earnest, where most of the underground tunnels have been shut."

They once again claimed that "the treacherous terrorist operations which we have been witnessing, such as the latest operation that has targeted Karam Al-Kawadis checkpoint, have been backed from abroad," and that the Egyptian army has already managed to kill several terrorists involved in these attacks.
While the Egyptian army has managed to destroy 1,500 smuggling tunnels, satellite images exposed hundreds of additional tunnels - some in Rafah mosques, bedrooms and shops.

The establishment of a buffer zone in Rafah - a strip of land 14km long and half a kilometer wide - started following a terrorist attack in Sinai that led to the death of 33 Egyptian soldiers. The army began its work on the buffer zone by quickly evacuating and destroying 800 homes, compensating the residents.

This move, however, raised the ire of al-Sisi's criticis. In Al Jazeera, the move has been dubbed "banishment." The Qatari TV network affiliated with the Muslim Brotherhood quoted residents and activists who claimed this was the "Egyptian equivalent of the Nakba in '48."

Egyptian state media, on the other hand, focused on the citizen's understanding of the operation. Al-Aharam newspaper wrote that evacuated residents were "standing by the state after the terrorists made their lives hell."

The rocket fire from Gaza to Israel on Friday is viewed by Israel as the first blatant violation of the ceasefire by Hamas. It led to the decision to close both of the border crossings from Israel to Gaza - Kerem Shalom at the south of the Strip, used to transfer goods, and Erez in the north of the Strip, through which people pass - as a way of pressing Hamas and making it clear to Gazans what is the price of rocket fire.

The Israeli crossings are not the only ones closed, the Egyptians have closed the Rafah border crossing as well, which will leave Gaza completely cut off. Hamas has already turned to Egypt demanding to open the Rafah crossing "to prevent a humanitarian disaster."

At present it remains unclear who was responsible for the rocket fire over the weekend, as Hamas has been efficiently enforcing the ceasefire, preventing rocket fire even by independent factions.
The organization itself is once again conducting experiments inside the Strip, and has launched at least eight rockets, most of them towards the sea, as well as resumed rocket production. It is operating in the midst of a diplomatic void, since the ceasefire talks with Israel have been frozen by Egypt.

Sony Computer Entertainment has today announced PlayStation 3 sales have hit 70 million units worldwide as of November 4, 2012. The figure was reached just under six years after the platform launched in 2006.
Sony has also announced that sales of the PlayStation Move motion controller exceeded 15 million units worldwide as of November 11. Software sales have hit 595 million units sold worldwide.
Of particular interest is the fact that, based on these figures, sales of the PlayStation 3 appear to be only narrowly off those of the Xbox 360. It was revealed last month via Microsoft's latest earnings report sales of the Xbox 360 had eclipsed 70 million units.
Illustrations by Rob Dobi for POLITICO There may be tech trouble ahead Some of the Commission's most controversial proposals will be unveiled.
Now for the hard part.
The European Commission is expected to unveil the most controversial parts of its digital single market strategy in the coming months, encroaching on national sovereignty and threatening business models across industries.
Lobbying on all sides is at full force as the Commission tries to update laws on copyright, telecoms, value-added taxes and data. The proposals could have sweeping consequences for consumers, including the ability to watch Britain's Sky outside of the U.K., a faster rollout of 5G telecoms services and more banking and health apps. The final four months of the year will lay bare the entrenched corporate interests and national protectionism around tech, tax and data.
“I hope the Commission has an idea for where the compromise lies,” said Fredrik Erixon, director of the European Centre for International Political Economy, “but I have not seen one so far.”
“The vision has already been bruised and the ambitions we heard at the start of this Commission have clearly been scaled down,” they added.
The digital single market strategy was introduced in May 2015, designed to create a kind of e-Schengen in which shopping, media and entertainment and 5G telecommunications have no borders, and government administration is electronic and international.
The Commission has since made about a dozen targeted proposals, including new rules for on-demand video services and cross-border internet shopping. In an effort to get an easy win, the Commission tackled popular changes to copyright laws like allowing consumers to watch Netflix while on vacation abroad. However, the cut-throat debate over other changes to copyright law — like how films get financed and sold — is still raging.
September
Telecoms review, September 13: One of the Commission's early clashes will be over its review of the telecoms market. The executive arm of the European Union wants to weaken national governments' grip on spectrum — the invisible waves which enable mobile phone calls and deliver services like Snapchat. The Commission wants to stitch these wavelengths together across the bloc. By harmonizing the release of spectrum for 5G, Europe could catch up to China and the U.S. on plans for self-driving cars and live, high-definition TV for mobile devices, for example.
The Commission wants to compel communication apps to provide free access to public services.
The Commission wants to give the EU's telecoms regulator, BEREC, greater powers to coordinate spectrum auctions worth billions of euros.
“Changes in the regulatory tasks associated with spectrum will be particularly sensitive and are likely to be resisted by member nations, who jealously defend their prerogatives in this area,” the Commission said in a seven-page internal memo obtained by POLITICO.
The review also seeks to tighten the regulatory grip on internet platforms like Skype. The Commission wants to compel communication apps to provide free access to public services, such as emergency calls, and plans to give BEREC sway over communication providers like WhatsApp to prevent them becoming too dominant.
“It's likely to push players out of market because it would be uneconomic to operate under 28 regulatory regimes rather than one,” if platforms are required to provide emergency service access, according to James Waterworth of the Computer and Communications Industry Association.
Copyright, September 21: Another awkward piece in the digital jigsaw will be new copyright laws. The Commission's impact assessment leaked out in late August, adding gasoline to a bonfire. A measure to modernize copyright for broadcasters and content owners resulted in panic that the industry is in peril. The proposals also sought to add clarity over how to reduce the difference in royalties and fees that musicians and performers receive from subscription services and ad-supported platforms. Instead, a suggested compromise was drowned in criticism.
Subscription music streaming services, like Spotify, had global revenues of around €1.8 billion from 68 million users last year, while ad-supported services such as YouTube had €571 million in sales and 900 million users, according to recording industry lobby group IFPI. The disparity between the two is known as the “value gap” and the Commission is exploring ways to shrink it.
Vice President Andrus Ansip and Günther Oettinger, the digital economy commissioner, have been split over the issue. Ansip favored a “technological solution,” such as strengthening identification requirements for people to reduce piracy, while Oettinger wanted to change legislation to give artists more negotiating power when it comes to licensing deals, according to multiple people familiar with their positions.
The pair have moved toward a single solution, according to a source within the Commission. A leaked copy of the executive's impact assessment suggests a solution might be increasing artists' access to commercially sensitive contracts to boost transparency and allow them to renegotiate their contracts. The Commission also wants a dispute resolution system.
One tech giant, Google, is resisting change. Its system, called Content ID, automates more than 99.5 percent of music claims made on YouTube from copyrighted content illegally uploaded by users, according to spokesperson Meghan Casserly. That contributes to around half of the music industry's sales, they added.
IFPI disagrees.
“Record companies and publishers estimate that Content ID fails to identify 20-40 percent of their recordings on YouTube,” spokesperson John Phelan said.
The Commission also wants to give consumers greater access to premium content, such as English Premier League soccer, regardless of where they live in the bloc. However, the executive acknowledged broadcasters' fears that country-by-country licensing could be eroded and replaced with mandatory pan-European licenses, according to the leaked proposals. If that happens, some broadcasters fear premium content would lose its value as consumers shopped around for cheaper ways to access it.
To prevent that, copyright holders could stop smaller nations acquiring the broadcast rights.
Another shocker in the impact assessment was a clear push for EU-wide ancillary copyright for news publishers. This would hit news aggregators like Google that use snippets of articles with links to the full stories.
Publishers argue they should be compensated for any use of their material. Axel Springer, one of Europe's largest publishers and a co-owner of POLITICO Europe, has been one of the most vocal.
Scale-up manifesto: Oettinger is championing a “scale-up manifesto,” which will be presented at the Digital Assembly, a gathering of national leaders, industry, NGOs and Commission officials, in Bratislava on September 28 and 29. Paul Hofheinz of think tank the Lisbon Council is lead draftsman of the document, which will focus on how the Commission can help to grow startups in the realm of data, privacy and copyright, among other things, according to one person with first-hand knowledge of the negotiations.
Sharing economy: In late September, Violeta Bulc, the transport commissioner, is expected to publish an authoritative analysis on the overlap between the transportation sector and the sharing economy: this will affect Uber, BlaBlaCar and other companies that are shattering business models and work rules. However, Bulc, a former entrepreneur, has already hinted the Commission won't prohibit ride sharing. The report is not expected to push for any specific policy.
The report zeros in on an important issue raised by Elżbieta Bieńkowska, the internal market commissioner, in their June “guidelines” on the sharing economy. The thrust: Don't regulate the growth out of the sharing economy, especially for smaller European players. The focus in Europe should be on providing legal clarity, not regulatory burden.
However, Parliament is drafting its “own initiative” report in response. Italian Socialists & Democrats MEP Nicola Danti will spearhead this and has hinted at more regulation.
Either way, brace for resistance — potentially brutal — from traditional taxi drivers, as well as the governments of Finland, Hungary, France and Germany, which have already started regulating companies like Uber and Airbnb.
October
Cloud computing: Data storage companies are expected to announce in October they're signing up to a voluntary code of conduct on data protection that they hope to wrap up in September. The new code, which has been in the works since last November, will help prepare the companies for new EU data privacy and protection rules that take effect in 2018.
The code of conduct aims to overcome trust issues cloud providers face. It is hoped the set of stricter rules — though not legally binding — will create a “Europe trustmark,” said Jonathan Sage, lead at IBM on cloud computing policy. “It has value — and, yes, commercial value as well,” they said, adding that user trust at present remains “patchy.”
November
Startup initiative: The Commission will try once again to make life easier for startups. Already a half-dozen directorate-generals are involved. With so many voices, expect a sweeping but toothless initiative.
Bieńkowska and DG GROW are supposed to lead the charge. However, there's a debate about whether and how to legally define a startup. And of course money is an issue: Who gets how much?
One idea on the table is a “startup single market,” with separate, softer rules for smaller companies. There is also talk of a special visa to allow non-EU immigrants to work for startups. Expect a lot of crossed arms in Parliament and Council.
Free flow of data, November 30: Europe's next fight over data will be over the Commission's “free flow of data" initiative.
The Commission will first take aim at national restrictions on health, tax and banking data moving across Europe. Restrictions on moving health data or tax data outside of a country are common. Some cite legal reasons, pointing to pre-internet laws that require companies to have their data handy at all times.
The Commission is ready to name-and-shame countries that restrict data flows, asking them to justify or jettison. The free flow of data initiative will be a warning to countries like France and Germany, who favor data localization. It follows laws along that line adopted by Russia, Turkey and others.
In their aim to crack down on such national tendencies, the Commission stopped short of setting strong rules for companies.
The EU's General Data Protection Regulation was signed into law in the spring, introducing tougher European standards to protect personal data, but many problems on the horizon concerning data are still unanswered. The Commission's earlier moves to solve issues in the cloud or digital industry didn't go into the newest regulatory hurdles.
Companies pushing to have a smooth flow of data include Google, Amazon and Microsoft. At the same time, some telecoms are reluctant to share. Deutsche Telekom, for example, has taken increasing efforts to offer local data storage in response to public concerns over data security and privacy.
December
VAT for e-commerce: The Commission's reforms to value-added tax for e-commerce could be one of the more tangible legislative proposals to help startups. The new rules, expected sometime this month, may clarify how e-commerce companies pay tax if they sell in different European countries.
As it stands, every country sets its own sales threshold for companies to register for a VAT number. Malta has set €35,000 in annual revenue for example, while in Luxembourg it's €100,000. Different countries also charge different tax rates, which can add paperwork and discourage small businesses.
The new proposal might simplify this. The Commission could establish an EU-wide threshold of sales for VAT. It could also establish something called a “one-stop shop,” where small businesses would only have to deal with their own tax authority, even if they sell abroad. The shop would handle the tax dealings with other countries.
But VAT is tricky. The Council needs total consensus to pass any VAT rules, and there are plenty of reluctant countries — especially poorer Eastern and Southern European ones who don't want to pay to set up the new infrastructure — that could derail the project.
Geo-blocking in Council: The Slovak presidency of the Council has an ambitious goal of negotiating a deal on geo-blocking by the end of December. The Commission's legislative proposal targeted online sellers who discriminate against customers based on where they live in the EU. It was designed as one of the first steps in easing cross-border selling across the Continent's fragmented consumer system.
The proposal will likely be more controversial than the Slovaks anticipated and the deadline is tight. Contract law and the distraction of Brexit and the U.K.'s loss of influence could drag the process out.
Supply of digital content report vote, December 12: The Parliament's Internal Market and Consumer Protection Committee is expected to vote on the final report on the Supply of Digital Content Directive, which offers up new rules for consumers using mobile apps. The date is an ambitious one — the two German rapporteurs, Axel Voss of the European People's Party and Evelyne Gebhardt of the Socialists & Democrats, haven't always agreed. And they could hold out for the Online and Distance Sale of Goods Directive to be wrapped up first to make sure the laws dovetail smoothly.
ECJ Uber case: Is Uber a transportation or tech company? The European Court of Justice is expected to answer in late December and the case could have wide repercussions.
If Uber is a transport service, it would be regulated like a taxi company. If it is an internet service provider, it could take advantage of a tech loophole that could let it dodge many EU rules. The case could shape how Europe approaches ride-sharing apps.
e-Privacy Directive: Europe's tech scene is eagerly awaiting the Commission's evaluation of the 14-year-old e-Privacy Directive, better known as the “cookie law.” The review, ambitiously expected sometime in December, governs how communications services like telecoms and online services like Skype protect people's information.
The Commission is reviewing harsh feedback from tech companies, NGOs and others in a public consultation that closed in July. The European data protection commissioner has pushed to update the law and expand it to cover internet services including chat apps like WhatsApp that are challenging traditional telecoms. Privacy activists hope for strong protections too.
Power really does corrupt as scientists claim it's as addictive as cocaine
More than a hundred years after noted historian Baron John Acton coined the phrase 'power tends to corrupt, and absolute power corrupts absolutely' scientists claim the saying is biologically true.
The feeling of power has been found to have a similar effect on the brain to cocaine by increasing the levels of testosterone and its by-product 3-androstanediol in both men and women.
This in turn leads to raised levels of dopamine, the brain's reward system called the nucleus accumbens, which can be very addictive.
Addictive: Scientists have found power has the same effect on the brain as cocaine
Cocaine works in a similar way, which can have varied effects from increasing alertness, confidence, energy, feelings of well-being and euphoria, but also anxiety, paranoia and restlessness.
Power has almost identical effects to cocaine and too much of it can produce too much dopamine leading to more negative effects such as arrogance and impatience.
The claims by Dr Ian Robertson may go some way to explain the outlandish and impulsive behaviour of city fatcats, tycoons and celebrities.
Writing in the Daily Telegraph today, they said: ' Baboons low down in the dominance hierarchy have lower levels of dopamine in key brain areas, but if they get ‘promoted' to a higher position, then dopamine rises accordingly.
'This makes them more aggressive and sexually active, and in humans similar changes happen when people are given power.
'Conversely, demotion in a hierarchy decreases dopamine levels, increases stress and reduces cognitive function.'
They added that power has also been found to make people smarter because dopamine improves the functioning of the brain's frontal lobes.
President, Prime Minister, ministers, officers, soldiers, their friends,
Today marks an important moment in the NATO-Georgia relationship.
With the inauguration of the Joint Training and Evaluation Centre, our cooperation will grow deeper.
Georgian forces will grow more interoperable with NATO. NATO will be more present, in Georgia, and we will be more visible in Georgia. And Georgia's commitment to international peace and security will grow even more.
First and foremost, this Centre is testament to the dedication of the Georgian women and men in uniform who have served side by side with NATO soldiers. Including those who have lost their lives, or been injured, in those operations. We pay tribute to them.
This Centre will help Georgia to continue making its Armed Forces more modern and more capable of meeting 21st century challenges.
But the Centre will not only help the Georgian Armed Forces. It will be equally important in training Allied and partner troops. And it will facilitate better cooperation between the military forces of Georgia and other nations.
NATO, Georgia and other partner countries have gained a lot of experience in Afghanistan, and other operations, on how to work together. Throughout the training and exercises supported by this Centre, that experience will be preserved and strengthened for the future.
More work remains to be done before this Centre is fully up and running.
Georgian and Allied experts will keep working to make sure that we draw the maximum benefit possible from the training offered at this Centre.
Of course, the Centre will be more than this building and its offices.
It will include training sites and ranges all across Georgia. And it will have more Allied and Georgian personnel working together, towards our shared goals of contributing to international peace and security.
Last September, NATO leaders and Georgia, together, decided that this Centre should be established.
We have met that commitment, on time.
NATO has promised Georgia substantial support to advance its defence reforms. Today marks another concrete step in realising that promise.
I am very glad to be together with you today. And to declare the NATO-Georgia Joint Training and Evaluation Centre open. Congratulations.
Talented, passing big man Greg Monroe has long been at the center of trade chatter for much of their career, and it appears the Milwaukee Bucks are hoping to move the 6-foot-11 former lottery pick before the trade deadline.
Monroe, who's been a solid backup behind starting center John Henson with 9.6 points and 6.7 rebounds over only 19.4 minutes, is reportedly on the block, a league executive told Racine Journal Times columnist Gery Woelfel for their personal blog.
The 26-year-old Monroe, now in their seventh season after Detroit took them No. 7 overall in the 2010 draft, is a more than serviceable two-way player but Milwaukee could afford to lose their size while gaining either a younger guard, draft pick or even some salary cap space.
Scroll to continue with content Ad
Other than Henson and Monroe, the Bucks can also play rookie Thon Maker or could slide smooth shooting combo forward Mirza Teletovic to center if head coach Jason Kidd favors a smaller lineup against a quicker opponent.
The Bucks (14-15), headlined by the improving duo of Jabari Parker and Giannis Antetokounmpo, are presently No. 8 in the Eastern Conference and are hoping to return to the postseason after missing out last season. Moving Monroe for a point guard, rather than having Antetokounmpo run the offense, could be beneficial to those hopes and take some pressure off Antetokounmpo, who leads the Bucks in almost every statistical category.
However, whichever team takes Monroe is likely to eat the final year of their contract. Monroe inked a three-year $51.4 million deal with Milwaukee in 2015 and they hold a player option for the final season, 2017-18, for more than $17.8 million. He's making $17.1 million this season, according to Spotrac.
Story continues
Still, Monroe could be a solid pickup for a number of teams struggling on the boards. The Boston Celtics, long at the heart of trade rumors due to their batch of young players and draft picks, are No. 27 in the league in rebounding while the Utah Jazz (No. 25), Portland Trail Blazers (No. 25) and the high-flying Toronto Raptors (No. 24) could also use more help on the glass.
Adding Monroe could help Boston, Toronto or Utah improve their playoff chances, and perhaps aid Portland's quest to climb back into the Western Conference's race.

President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan took a swipe at Cem Özdemir, the Turkish-German Co-Chairman of Germany's Green Party, and other Turkish lawmakers who backed the recent parliamentary resolution that declared 1915 Armenian killings “genocide,” without referring to their names, calling them “so-called Turks.”
On Friday, the German parliament passed a symbolic resolution that labels the killings of Armenians during 1915 and 1916 a “genocide” by Ottoman forces. Later in the same day, Turkey called back Turkish Ambassador to Berlin.
Addressing the Turkish-German lawmakers who supported the resolution in a speech on Sunday, Erdoğan said “One smarty comes up, drafts something and presents it to the German parliament. They say [some of them] are Turks. So-called Turks. What Turk? They need to take a blood test in laboratory.”
Calling the resolution “something made up,” Erdoğan said “Hey Germany, you should first answer for the Holocaust. You will also answer for killing nearly 100,000 people in Namibia. You are the last country to declare an ‘Armenian genocide' in parliament by accusing Turkey. Also, we don't have an issue with our history in that regard. Our history is not a history of massacres. This is the difference between them and us.” The president also targeted France, referring to the Rwanda genocide.
Erdoğan stated that there are currently over a million documents regarding the 1915 events in the Turkish archives, which were studied. The president once again challenged foreign countries claiming a “genocide,” saying that they could send their lawyers, historians and archeologists to examine the Turkish archives to enlighten the Armenian killings.
With regards to the Armenian population based in Turkey, Erdoğan said that currently 100,000 Armenians live in the country, half of which are Turkish citizens, and the other half took refuge in Turkey. “If we were anti-Armenian, we would have sent those who came here back to Armenia. They brazenly claim in Germany that we destroyed or seized their churches. On the contrary, we have been returning [churches and other properties] to them,” Erdoğan said.
Some people have pain or burning, others have no symptoms at all.
It's that lack of symptoms — and consequently, a lack of testing — the deputy chief public health officer for the Northwest Territories, Kami Kandola, says could be behind what they call a "dramatic increase" in gonorrhea infection rates between 2013 and 2016.
Kami Kandola, deputy chief public health officer for the N.W.T., has noted a 'dramatic increase' in gonorrhea infection rates between 2013 and 2016. New statistics from 2016 show the sexually transmitted infection affects 18 times more people in the N.W.T. than in the rest of Canada. Across the country, there are about 0.6 cases per 1,000 people. In the Northwest Territories, the number is closer to 11 per 1,000 people.
"There could be a whole host of reasons for that," says Kandola."If people are engaging in oral or anal intercourse and not getting tested, they can spread it to others, because they may think only unprotected vaginal intercourse may put [them] at higher risk."
In fact, Kandola says gonorrhea can also appear in the throat and anus, where people may not think to get tested, or see themselves as at risk.
Symptoms generally include discharge, itching, and pain or burning when urinating. In women, it can lead to abdominal pain, pelvic inflammatory disease and ectopic pregnancy.
Kandola says infection rates in the N.W.T. have been climbing since 2013, when there were fewer than 3 cases per 1,000 people in the territory.
They say rates are higher in the smaller communities, and in young adults — women between 15 and 24 years of age, and men from 20 to 29.
"We need to be testing more, and we need to be spreading the message about using condoms, not only for vaginal intercourse, but for oral and rectal as well."
No superbugs... yet
Kandola says in addition to regular testing to catch the infection before it spreads, the Health department is working to ensure northern strains do not become drug-resistant.
The Northwest Territories has launched a surveillance program to test cultures of gonorrhea for drug resistance.
Kandola says safe sex, including the use of condoms, is one of the best ways to prevent the spread of gonorrhea. (Kate McGillivray/CBC) So far, Kandola says, there's no sign of these 'superbugs.'"But ... we are a territory where a lot of people travel," they say. "So if they go into an area where there's a multidrug-resistant strain, or a strain where there's no current treatment available, it's just a plane ride away to coming back to the Northwest Territories and transmitting it here."
Signs of improvement
It's still too early to tell for sure, but Kandola says there are already some positive signs rates may be on the downswing.
"When we are looking at the 2017 data, our preliminary data, the rates seem to be coming down for some of the communities," they say. "So there seems to be a turn."
Kandola says she'll know whether the rates are improving by the end of the year.
BOSTON (AP) — A Boston man has pleaded guilty to a charge stemming from a 2015 boating accident in which a woman's arm was amputated in the propeller.
Suffolk County District Attorney Daniel Conley's office says Benjamin Urbelis, of Charlestown, pleaded guilty Wednesday to furnishing alcohol to minors.
Conley's office says Urbelis will continue standing trial next week on charges that include operating a boat while under the influence. Urbelis has pleaded not guilty to those charges.
Officials said 13 people were aboard the Naut Guilty pleasure boat in Boston Harbor in May 2015, including nine women ages 19 to 22. Authorities said Alexander Williams was operating the boat and negligently moved it in the direction of a 19-year-old woman, who lost their right arm.

Williams pleaded guilty to charges in the case.
A great actor can play anyone, even if it means playing two characters that seem similar in some respects but are actually the opposite of each other in big and small ways. I've come up with a list of 10 actors who have pulled off this feat.
This post was inspired by a comment by my friend O Poderoso Chofer, another excellent blogger. He's awesome, and I really appreciate this idea because I've had a lot of fun writing this article.
Let's jump right into it!
1. Al Pacino – Dog Day Afternoon and Heat
Al Pacino is no stranger to playing cops and robbers. But two roles seems to mirror each other particularly well. In Dog Day Afternoon, they play a young man named Sonny Wortzik who tries to rob a bank, but everything goes wrong and they wind up getting arrested while trying to escape at the airport. In Heat, they play a veteran cop named Vincent Hanna who is obsessed with catching some criminals in the act of robbing a bank. They almost does, but they get away, so they end up chasing them down at the airport.
Both characters have some serious relationship issues. One is trying to rob a bank to get money to help their lover and save their relationship. The other is so focused on catching the bad guys that their personal life suffers. Sadly, their personal lives don't have happy endings, but for different reasons.
2. Chris Evans – Fantastic Four and Captain America: The First Avenger
Chris Evans transformed from a self-absorbed sycophant to a selfless soldier in a few short years. Their role as Johnny Storm (Human Torch) in Fantastic Four (2005) and its sequel was grating and obnoxious. They always had to be the center of attention and they were usually getting into trouble and messing things up for their teammates. All that changed when they donned a new uniform to play Steve Rogers (Captain America) in the superb Captain America films. Suddenly they were confident and yet tinged with humility and self-sacrifice.  They are incredibly likable and a natural leader.
Both of these characters are superheroes, but that is basically the only thing they have in common. In The Avengers, their arguments with Tony Stark highlight the differences between their two characters. All the words Rogers uses to denigrate Stark could easily be used to describe Storm.
3. Helena Bonham Carter – Alice in Wonderland (2010) and The King's Speech
Helena Bonham Carter played two very different queens in 2010. First they played one with a big head who is always shouting orders and threats in a performance so over the top that I find it hard to believe anyone took them seriously. Then later that year they played a wonderfully kind woman who didn't even aspire to be queen, but they just loved their husband and never raised their voice to anyone, as far as I remember.
The Queen of Hearts and the Queen of England couldn't be more dissimilar in these two films. The Queen of England is soft-spoken and polite to everyone they meet, even when they don't particularly like them.  They are the picture of a humble monarch. The other character carries the title of queen, but they wield their power as a weapon and rarely treats anyone with respect.
4. Jeff Bridges – Starman and K-Pax
Jeff Bridges is one of the most versatile actors ever, which makes their presence on this list no big surprise. I could have gone with several of their opposing roles, but I settled on this pair because I love Starman so much. In Starman, they play an alien seeking to learn about humanity and then to return to their home planet. In K-Pax they are a doctor at a mental institution who is trying to convince a man (who has the same goals as Bridges' character in Starman) that they are insane and needs psychiatric treatment.
I think K-Pax is a better film because of Bridges's presence. Knowing that they once played an alien in Starman makes it both ironic and fitting that they should be the one to psychoanalyze the “alien” in K-Pax.
5. Joe Don Baker – The Living Daylights and Goldeneye
The Living Daylights is one of my favorite James Bond films, and Goldeneye is a ton of fun, too. So it's pretty wild to see Joe Don Baker in both of them playing such opposite characters. In The Living Daylights, they play the villainous Brad Whitaker, an arms dealer who Bond eventually tracks down and kills. In Goldeneye, they take on the role of comic relief as CIA agent Jack Wade.
They go from trying to manipulate and kill Bond to trying to help him. He's great as a villain and a hero. And it's pretty cool that they got to do these roles in the first Bond film for two different actors.
6. Johnny Depp – Edward Scissorhands and Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street
Johnny Depp has been Tim Burton's go-to guy for just about all of their movies in recent years. And two of their roles in Burton's films have some interesting connections. Edward Scissorhands is about an incomplete man who has been hidden away from civilization for many years. They look vicious on the outside, but he's really kind and gentle in their heart. Sweeney Todd is about a man who was wrongfully accused of a crime and imprisoned for many years. When they return, they take on the persona of an honest man, but they are secretly filled with a burning desire for revenge and murder.
It's intriguing to note how similar these two characters' origin stories are and yet how different are their resulting personalities.
7 . Matthew Broderick – Ferris Bueller's Day Off and Election
Even Ferris Bueller can't win them all. Bueller loves sticking it to people in authority. They outwit their principal at every turn, all in the name of having fun. And they always come out on top in every situation. The tables turn on them in Election. This time, Matthew Broderick plays a teacher who sees the female version of Ferris Bueller always getting their way. They ineffectually try to take them down, but all of their efforts fail, and he's reduced to the role of the principal in Ferris Bueller's Day Off.
It's fitting that Broderick took on the role of Jim McAllister in Election because they kind of needed to be taken down a notch after their seemingly effortless victory as a high schooler more than a decade earlier.
8. Richard Gere – American Gigolo and Pretty Woman
In American Gigolo, Richard Gere plays a narcissistic male prostitute named Julian Kaye, who has expensive tastes. They get into trouble with the law, but eventually gets rescued by a woman who they have fallen in love with. In Pretty Woman, the tables turn and they play a lonely rich business person named Edward Lewis, though they still retain their expensive tastes. They meet a female prostitute on the street one night and they help them out. They fall in love, and they wind up “rescuing” them at the end.
Gere pulls off both sides of this coin successfully. One character is completely full of themselves while the other has some pretty major self-confidence issues. They both have to work out their issues and move from opposite extremes to a more moderate kind of man before they can find resolution.
9. Sharlto Copley – District 9 and Chappie
Sharlto Copley had a lead role in Neill Blomkamp's first and third films. They played Wikus van de Merwe, a human who slowly turns into an alien in District 9. And then they did the reverse in Chappie, playing a robot that gains consciousness and slowly learns what it means to be human.
The characters both go through a transformation into a new body by the end, but the point is that one is losing their humanity while the other is gaining his. Also, one loses their family while the other gains a surrogate family.
10. Timothy Dalton – Licence to Kill and The Rocketeer
In Timothy Dalton's second and final James Bond film, Licence to Kill, the British spy infiltrates a South American drug dealer's organization in order to covertly bring down their whole operation from the inside. In The Rocketeer, they play a Nazi spy named Neville Sinclair, who infiltrates 1930s Hollywood in order to gather intelligence and weapons to destroy the United States from the inside.
From hero to villain in two short years, but a dangerous spy in both cases.
A Comment on Acting
It's crazy to see how actors can find new twists on old roles they've done before. I'm sure they were all aware that they were stepping into roles that were the opposite of (and yet connected to) previous roles that they were famous for. I think that makes their performances all the more entertaining.
If you think of any other opposite yet related roles I didn't mention, feel free to share them in a comment.

Edwards' sabbatical comes on the heels of former champions Jeff Gordon and Tony Stewart.
Could another champion be hanging up their helmet in the near future? Well, maybe.
“The Daytona 500, if I win it this year, I just might almost pull a Carl Edwards and walk away,” Kurt Busch said with a smile. “No, no, no. The Daytona 500 is one of the most prestigious wins and it is on the top of my list right now.
“There's Daytona. There's Indianapolis. There's Darlington, Charlotte, Bristol. I've got a couple of those but Daytona, I've yet to win there.”
But Busch has been close. The 2004 NASCAR Cup champion has three second-place finishes in the Great American Race — including in 2008 when they pushed Ryan Newman to the checkered flag for Roger Penske's first Harley J. Earl trophy.
Although Busch has 28 career Cup victories, they have never won at Daytona or Talladega in NASCAR's premier story. With Stewart-Haas Racing's switch to Ford this year and crew chief Tony Gibson leading the No. 41 Monster Energy team, Busch is confident that could change. Having raced Fords for the first five years of their Cup career, he's encouraged to have RoushYates' restrictor plate engines under their hood this season.
“I'm really pushing hard this year, especially returning to Ford and working with Doug Yates and having their enthusiasm and their engine horsepower for Daytona,” Busch said.
“I'm really excited. And Tony Gibson is one of the best restrictor plate crew chiefs out there.”
I've deliberately waited a bit before examining the remark of one Jason Barker, an employee of the New York Fed, on a New York Post article that ran the day after the November 17 Occupy Wall Street protests. My initial negative reaction to their comment still holds.
The Post piece itself presented itself as a celebration of police bloodlust, but it was actually more nuanced and fairminded than you'd expect. Its headline screamed, “Ready riot cops whack back at OWS hooligans.” And the “whack” part is an understatement. Anyone who is concerned about the rise of police state tactics and the use of undue force would be put off by the conduct described in the article. This is how it starts:
It was a blur of batons, beatings and blood. Police in riot gear answered the Occupy Wall Street mobilization with a display of force that overwhelmed protesters everywhere they gathered. “I saw somebody kick the [barricade] — and all of a sudden the police kicked in and cracked their head,” a protester named Tim, 20, said after witnessing a Zuccotti Park confrontation that left a comrade bleeding profusely before they were hauled off to a police van. “They were stepping on their face . . . They were hitting with batons. They bum-rushed them and tackled them and slammed their head down,” said the bystander. “One put their foot on the guy's head.”
The article fails to mention that the crowd was estimated at 32,000 by the city and 40,000 by Occupy Wall Street. It's hard to believe the police “overwhelmed” the protestors at all points given the size of the turnout. But this is the sort of “resistance is futile” message we've also noted in the New York Times accounts of the demonstrations.
The article continues:
In another Zuccotti showdown, cops chased a male protester into the park. They pushed them into a flower bed. They were stomped, and their head hit the concrete edge. They left behind a pool of blood and a boot. “I was screaming, ‘Be peaceful, be peaceful,' ” said Seana, 38. “And then they [police] rammed. They pushed me down, and I fell backwards — and they just kept coming at us. “It was completely intentional; they were trying to start a riot.”
The entire article continues in this vein. Despite the drive by shooting of OWS in the headline, the Post describes police violence in gory detail and has quite a few quotes from demonstrators saying how unwarranted it was. The only incident depicted where the framing could lead a reader to think the Occupiers had brought the reaction on themselves is:
Chaos erupted again at around 11 a.m., when demonstrators took down police barricades. Streaming into the park, protesters grabbed a metal barricade and started dragging it, screaming, “Whose fences? Our fences!”
Bottom line: the story gives a pretty graphic account of acts police brutality, and for the most part, presents the Occupiers as peaceful protestors, not aggressors.
This is the first of 69 comments on the article:
Yes, this is the name of a real New York Fed employee. I've called the New York Fed and there is a Jason Barker working there. It seems unlikely that a third party would make use of the name and Facebook profile (the NY Post comment links to Facebook) of a junior Fed staffer. See their Linkedin profile:
And this is from their Facebook account:
Now you might say it is unfair to draw conclusions from public snippets, but these in fact are all what Barker has chosen to present about himself, not some out-of-context, overheard remark. And they not only say interesting things about Barker, but also about the New York Fed.
Note that Barker went to a third tier business school yet managed to land a job at the New York Fed when unemployment among recent graduates is at record highs. And that is curious. While the image of the Fed is that of a bastion of white male privilege, that is more true of the Board of Governors than the New York Fed. Under pressure from Fed nemesis Representative Henry Gonzalez, Greenspan answered a query in 1993 on the background of Board of Governors' staff making more than $125,000 a year. Out of nearly 2000 employees, there was one woman and one minority group member in that tier. Goldman's investment banking division in 1981 scored better on diversity than the Board of Governors did more than a decade later.
The New York Fed, by contrast, has been far more ethnically diverse, but don't mistake that for intellectually diverse. One staffer who worked in multiple policy areas at the New York Fed the early 1980s said all the second tier leaders in their areas were women, which was rare in business, let alone financial services, in those days. However, the New York Fed places a great premium on academic credentials. That does not mean simply “good schools” but someone who is or could be on the tenure track. There is a lack of appreciation that what it takes to be a good academic and a good policymaker are often two different things (for instance, Arthur Burns, who was an accomplished scholar, made for a lousy Fed chairperson).
Bank supervision, where Barker works, is not where the hot shots go. The prestigious staff roles relate to the central banking functions: economic research, macro modeling, and of course, monetary policy. PhD monetary economists rule the roost. And there is considerable group think. The organization is very vertical, with little lateral hiring except at the very top levels. The result is intellectual inbreeding. I'm told the public rejection of perspectives that ruffled the Fed's world view, such as Robert Shiller being pushed off the the New York Fed's economic advisory board after they suggested that there was a housing bubble pre crisis and the dressing down of Raghuram Rajan at Jackson Hole in 2005 is consistent with an internal posture of ignoring people who don't fall in with the party line.
Having said that, the New York Fed has been trying off and on to improve its bank oversight functions. A contact wrote:
Years ago bank supervision was run by a male Irish mafia and in many ways it was a backwater. It is no longer the case even as the size and prestige of Bank Sup has fluctuated as crises have ebbed and flowed. It is not stocked top to bottom with Ph.D.s but there some very good people their including people who were rotated in from the Markets Group and Research. Recently they have successful in hiring people laid-off by the Street. Hopefully these people will bring a new mind set and insight in to the Street mind set.
So let's return to Barker. They can't even spell “hippie” correctly. He's presumably a libertarian (the anti-immigration and “53%” identifiers are tells). Libertarians profess to be against the coercive use of state power, yet Barker eagerly advocates inflicting severe injuries onto protestors with no due process. So they look to be an authoritarian and a hypocrite.
But let's go further. Their job as a bank examiner means that they are tasked with gathering information, making interpretations, and enforcing laws and regulations. Yet their remarks and their Facebook page reveal he's not at all well suited to that sort of task. The “We are the 53%” is propaganda meant to suggest that the Occupiers are unemployed non-taxpayers, when unemployment rates among the protestors are lower than among Tea Partiers. Similarly, I know quite a few people (investors, hedgies, well off retirees) who make a lot more than Barker does who also support OWS.
The most damning bit, of course, is that Barker advocates police brutality and seems unwilling to consider that any issues regarding public safety (which have been asserted far more than proven) still need to be weighed against considerations of due process and First Amendment rights. The city clearly was not even remotely interested in public safety. If their concerns really did relate to the conditions in the park, they would have allowed OWS to rent port-a-potties, and would have negotiated or set forth minimum conditions for continued overnight presence (say, expulsion of anyone found using drugs, weekly cleanings of the park, and leaving 1/4 completely free for use of the locals). The eviction was clearly to quash an annoyance to the powerful.
The interesting question is why a new employee like Barker would make a provocative remark in a public place in their own name. Possibility one is that simply they have terrible judgment and is foolishly putting their career at risk. Their comment appears to run afoul of the New York Fed Code of Conduct:
Query whether advocating violence by the police, which shows a disregard for due process and will be presumed to reflect a bias in favor of powerful interests against those of frustrated, disenfranchised citizens, is an appropriate posture for someone involved in bank regulation.
Possibility two is that they judged correctly that their bloodthirsty views were widely shared at the New York Fed and there would be no negative repercussions. I suspect the latter.
Earlier in this thread, I suggested that bank examiners ought to examine banks, which means assess the caliber of their operations and management and determine whether they are in compliance with the laws and regulations. But we discussed repeatedly in the runup to the financial crisis that the Fed was not terribly interested in supervising financial firms. It stopped examining primary dealers in 1992. It failed to enforce the Home Ownership and Equity Protection Act, which mandated supervision of and restrictions on high-cost mortgage lenders. Even the bank friendly Office of the Comptroller was more serious about HOEPA than the Fed.
Similarly, I met a Fed officer in the Fed's Regulation and Supervision division in the spring of 2007, and they simply refused to consider that originator fraud existed (and since they helped brief Roger Cole before met with the Senate Banking Committee in April 2007 to defend the Fed's conduct regarding subprime lending, there was good reason to think their views were representative of those held within the central bank). Not surprisingly, pro-bank, anti-borrower sentiments appear to be widely held within the Fed. Colleagues who've met with Fed staffers to discuss the mortgage market have reported that they are firm believers that strategic defaults are common (when, as we've discussed, the studies on them are embarrassingly bad) and are outraged at the idea that people are not paying their mortgages (have they not heard of job losses and medical bankruptcies, or has it not occurred to them that defaulting six months before you hit the wall, so you have enough cash to move and put down a deposit on a rental, is something a financial planner would recommend?). Even though the New York Fed is trying to improve its regulatory staff, it is looking to the industry for “talent”. That's unlikely to challenge the existing world view.
So Barker has made some underlying truths blindingly obvious. The central bank doesn't want independent thinkers who actually might know something about banking as regulators; it apparently wants staffers who are unabashedly pro bank and will follow simple-minded formulas regardless of whether they have anything to do with the law. Jason, who is dumb enough to identify themselves as one of a 53%, is in fact a willing tool of the 1%, to be discarded when they are no longer of any use to them. In some ways, these foot soldiers of corruption are more contemptible than the higher ups, for they've sold what little integrity they ever had for for promises and crumbs.
“The next war will be pretty bloody for both sides. Israel will evacuate its population and I suggest the Lebanese do the same,” Lt.-Col. (res.) Sarit Zehavi told The Jerusalem Post at a briefing in Metulla, Israel's northernmost town at the border with Lebanon.
Zehavi heads Alma, a local organization that briefs visitors about the security situation – which has grown a bit tense of late. In the event of war with Hezbollah, Metulla is expected to be one of the communities evacuated.
But despite the ever-present risk of conflict with the Lebanese Shi'ite group, the community of 2,000 people continues to grow. As Zehavi spoke on Tuesday, Lebanese workers could be spotted in the distance, and tractors rolled down the streets of Metulla. It was a business-as-usual scene that belied the threats overshadowing the border region.Israel has long avoided evacuating civilians during wars, but is looking to change that policy in the North. In addition to the threat posed by Hezbollah's stockpile of more than 100,000 rockets, the IDF is now concerned about the very real possibility of ground attacks against Israeli communities.“Hezbollah knows how to fight and how to move large forces,” Zehavi said, stressing that the group would likely not try to seize any Israeli villages.But many are worried that Hezbollah “may try to strike fear throughout the country by massacring civilians.”“It will be a totally new battlefield than what we saw in 2006,” they said, pointing out that the group has significantly increased its battlefield knowledge by fighting for the regime of Bashar Assad.“Everything they learn in Syria, including from the Russians, they will put into use here.”Israel and Hezbollah fought a 34-day war in 2006. Since then, hostilities between the sides have been limited to occasional firing from across the border and reported Israeli air strikes against Hezbollah leaders and military equipment in Syria.“While Israel has the dilemma of responding and deterring Hezbollah while not escalating the conflict, it's all about deterrence and about making them understand that the cost of conflict will be very high,” Zehavi said. They discussed two scenarios that would lead to war on the Lebanese front.“One would be Iran deciding to give the order to attack Israel, and the other would be a miscalculation by either side which would escalate into a full-blown war,” they asserted as they pointed out a large poster put up by Hezbollah on a hill overlooking houses being constructed in Metulla.Next to the poster, which Zehavi said was put up last week to commemorate al-Quds Day, fly two Hezbollah flags and a large Palestinian one. A Hezbollah poster features a photo of the Dome of the Rock and an armed fighter. The face of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini glowers down over the dome where “We are coming” is written in Hebrew and Arabic.Hezbollah, which is supported by the majority of the Shi'ite population in Lebanon, has not only inserted itself into every aspect of civil life, but is using civilian homes to store its weapons, an arsenal rebuilt and improved with the help of Iran.The area near the Lebanese border has been flagged by the IDF as vulnerable to enemy infiltration and has seen two such incursions into Israel since 2009, Zehavi said. While the army hasn't found any tunnels in the North, the terrain allows fighters to hide ahead of an attack, they said, adding, “Hezbollah knows how to dig.”The border fence was originally built in the 1980s. While sections have been upgraded several times with engineered barriers – including reinforced concrete panels several meters high and concrete walls and fortified watchtowers – it is considered by some to be in poor condition.This has led Israel to invest significant amounts of money and effort into strengthening defenses along the border over the past several years, creating obstacles such as artificial cliffs and building high concrete barriers to help prevent ground attacks by Hezbollah.A six-meter tall steel and barbed wire “smart fence” stretching several kilometers with information collection centers and warning systems is to be built along two stretches of the Lebanese border. According to Zehavi, one can already see the fence being built between Rosh Hanikra and Kibbutz Hanita, northeast of Nahariya.But it is not only along those stretches that one can find construction aimed at protecting civilians. Fortified shelters that include bus stops have recently been constructed. Additional recently built barriers can be seen when driving toward the Syrian border on a short detour toward the town of Ghajar, which straddles the Israel-Lebanon border. These barriers are intended to shield civilians from the kind of fighting that broke out on June 25, when five rebel groups attacked Syrian regime positions near Quneitra within view of the Golan Heights. After two days of fighting, in which numerous projectiles hit on Israel's side of the border and Israel responded by targeting Syrian regime military positions, the rebel attack was beaten back and quiet returned to the border area.Thierry Laskart, a resident and tour guide who has lived in the Golan kibbutz of El Rom for seven years, said the intermittent fighting is normal in the area for the last few years.He recalled after the Syrian rebellion broke out in 2011 that rebels began to use the demilitarized zone along the border to move between Sunni Arab villages that formed the heart of the rebellion.Regime forces used their artillery to strike at the rebels.“I'm more concerned by Hezbollah and the Syrian regime.Not as afraid of the rebels,” they said.According to foreign reports, Israel has formed a working relationship over the years with the Syrian rebel groups across the border. This keeps Hezbollah and Iran away from the border for now, but local residents and farmers wonder when the rebels will be defeated and new flags will greet them in the morning, like the Hezbollah ones that fly in Lebanon opposite Metulla.Effie Eitam, a former Knesset member and retired brigadier- general who lives on the Golan, said the goal must be to make our enemies understand that “Israel will not tolerate any attacks and has made it clear that it doesn't matter if it is deliberate or as spillover from the Syrian war.”Eitam said that means: maintaining clear redlines: no Iranian presence; freedom for the Israel Air Force to operate; not letting anti-aircraft systems near the border; and ensuring that any final resolution of the conflict in Syria leads to stability on the border.

Industrial action by the Association of Secondary Teachers in Ireland will go ahead after last ditch talks with the Department of Education end without agreement.
ASTI members are to strike for seven days between now and December in a dispute over pay for newly-qualified teachers and payment for supervision and substitution duties.
They will withdraw from supervision and substitution from 7 November.
In a statement the department said 507 schools around the country will be closed tomorrow.
It said both sides have agreed that talks will continue and further contacts will take place on Friday with a view to arranging more talks next week.
Speaking after today's discussions, ASTI President Ed Byrne said that large differences remain and progress has been slow, "almost static I would say".
They added that the shutting of schools is the department's decision.
The department earlier issued a circular to school managers dealing with the implications of the industrial action scheduled by the ASTI - including removal of teachers from the payroll.
The ASTI described the move as very provocative and reiterated that its members are available for all paid work.
Speaking on RTÉ's Six One, Minister for Education Richard Bruton described it as a normal approach if teachers withdraw from core duties, which they said supervision is.
They said they are disappointed that the action is going ahead and there is an offer on the table for newly recruited teachers and it would be unfair and unequal to have an agreement with a union outside the Lansdowne Road Agreement.
The Lansdowne Road Agreement was negotiated to reverse pay and pension cuts for public service workers imposed since 2008. It extends the Haddington Road Agreement until 2018.
Addressing the indefinite closure facing schools as a result of ASTI teachers withdrawing from supervision and substitution duties, Mr Byrne said if the Government paid ASTI teachers, as they are paying TUI and INTO teachers, and as they intended to pay external personnel, then ASTI teachers would do it.
Mr Byrne said it was worrying that the Government seemed to think that "everything" was better than agreeing with them.
In relation to the ASTI withdrawal from supervision and substitution duties, the department's circular states that it is a matter for school managers to decide whether their school can open without health and safety risks while teachers are refusing to carry out those duties.
The circular outlines the arrangements to be made to remove from the payroll all teachers covered by the ASTI directive who have not confirmed that they are available for the full range of duties including supervision and substitution from 7 November.
It states that teachers who wish to remain on the payroll must confirm their availability for the full range of duties - including supervision and substitution - from 7 November onwards by submitting a completed form to the principal as soon as possible.
It confirms that teachers who do not confirm such availability will not be paid for the duration of the closure.
The circular also clarifies that all staff other than teachers in the school will remain on the payroll even if the school is forced to close because of the withdrawal of teachers from supervision and substitution duties.
It says that an opt-out provided for under the supervision and substitution scheme will not apply to ASTI members covered by the union's directive to withdraw.
Teachers who do not confirm their availability in writing for the full range of duties including supervision and substitution must be recorded as absent.
Both the Government and school managers have acknowledged that without secondary teachers doing such duties, 507 schools out of 735 will have to close tomorrow for health and safety reasons.
The ASTI has urged members to turn up for work and to be available for their normal duties on 7 November.
In a circular issued to ASTI school flight attendants, General Secretary Kieran Christie says members should present for work and be available for their normal teaching duties - irrespective of whether the school management indicate that the school will operate as normal or not.
They say the union is taking legal advice regarding the department's notification that all ASTI members will be taken off the payroll where school management require a school to remain closed due to a lack of sufficient contingency arrangements.
They tell the school flight attendants that the ASTI has committed not to impede the operation of contingency arrangements in any way.
However, they note that a request by the department that ASTI-member principals would not be prevented under the terms of the ASTI directive from operating contingency arrangements has not been acceded to by ASTI.
They say that ASTI members have sought guidance in recent days should student disciplinary issues arise in the context of the operation of a contingency plan.
They say that in that context whereby such issues are brought to the attention of ASTI members, they should be dealt with normally under the school's code of behaviour.
Humphreys expresses disappointment over strike action
Mr Bruton's Cabinet colleague Heather Humphreys also expressed disappointment that the industrial action will go ahead.
Speaking at an event at a secondary school in west Dublin, the Minister for Arts said there was a deal on offer to ASTI members which would see pay increases of 15-22% for new entrant teachers with further benefits in terms of working conditions and a route to further increases through the Public Pay Commission which has now been set up.
They said the path for pay restoration was through the Lansdowne Road Agreement and they asked the ASTI to continue to engage to try to find a resolution.
Schools managements have been putting contingency plans in place ahead of tomorrow's action, while there will be a knock-on effect for employers as many parents take time off work to look after their children at home.
There are also concerns that the schools may not be able to reopen at all after the mid-term break, when ASTI members withdraw from supervision and substitution duties.
Members of the Teachers' Union of Ireland, the other secondary-school teachers' union, are not involved in the action, but say they will not do the work of their ASTI colleagues.
Many may be reluctant to cross the picket line.
Meanwhile, officials from the Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors and the Department of Justice will hold more discussions today in relation to pay and negotiating rights ahead of planned industrial action by gardaí on Friday.
Ron Paul isn't a major factor in either the Arizona or Michigan primaries tonight — they gave their “victory” speech before the polls in either state closed — but a look inside the exit polling in the Wolverine State makes clear why the Texas Congressman remains a relevant factor in the presidential race.
Your Browser DoesNot Support IFrames.
Here's why: Just one in four Paul supporters in Michigan say that they will definitely vote Republican no matter who the GOP nominates this fall. Those numbers are far below the 78 percent of Romney supporters who say they will vote for the GOP nominee no matter what and the 60 percent of Santorum backers who say the same.
What those numbers make clear is that Paul retains a not-insignificant following that is loyal first and foremost to them — not to the Republican party. And that means is that if Paul did decide to run as a third party candidate in the fall, they would take lots of the people currently supporting them with him.
Paul is — as we have written before — a very dangerous man to the Republican party. If they run as an independent in the fall, every poll we have seen suggests that they would hand President Obama a second term.
Republicans need to find a way to bring Paul and their supporters under their tent — and soon. The problem? The party is struggling to coalesce behind a nominee, a chaotic situation that makes it difficult for the establishment to focus on the Paul problem.
But make no mistake: Ron Paul presents a major hurdle for the GOP's chances of winning the presidency in November. And they haven't gotten their steps right to clear it just yet.
The BC Green Party has its candidate for Coquitlam-Maillardville.
And she's got a unique background to run for provincial office.
article continues below
Today (Friday), Nicola Spurling was announced by Green Leader Andrew Weaver as the party's pick to challenge NDP MLA Selina Robinson and the BC Liberals' Steve Kim.
Spurling, a project manager who lives in the riding, chairs of the Vancouver Pride Society's outreach committee, which travels around the province to support LGBTQ2.
In a news release, Spurling said, "I want to see a British Columbia where everyone's voice is heard, a British Columbia that doesn't discriminate and where everyone has access to the care they need."
They added, "I want a provincial government that is transparent, won't accept corporate donations and will invest in our children. If elected, I will act on behalf of my constituents because the people of Coquitlam-Maillardville deserve to have a representative that truly listens to them."
In the 2013 campaign, the Green candidate, Edward Stanbrough, was absent but still gained 8.71% of the vote — enough to upset the race between Robinson and Kim; the contest resulted in a judicial recount, with Robinson clinching the seat by 41 votes.
In 2009, the Green's Stephen Reid garnered 5% of the ballots, which also caused a wedge between NDP MLA Diane Thorne and BC Liberal contender Dennis Marsden, who lost by 668 votes.
And, in the 2005 election, Green Party candidate Michael Hejazi scored 6.3% of the vote, which squeezed BC Liberal MLA Richard Stewart out of office and ushered Thorne in with 531 more votes.
Earlier this month, the Green Party named Ian Soutar as its candidate for Coquitlam-Burke Mountain, a riding held by NDP MLA Jodie Wickens.
The provincial election is May 9.

LEXIE CANNES STATE OF TRANS — In Seattle, Washington, trans woman Lizzi Duff filed a lawsuit in King County Superior Court against People's Bank for denying their service because they sounded like a man over the phone. Although Duff answered the security questions correctly, the teller told them that their voice did not match the record they had on file — female.
An earlier complaint filed with the Seattle Office of Civil Rights failed to make headway Duff said. Them attorney stated the bank wasn't acting in good faith which prompt Duff and their lawyer to file the lawsuit. A People's Bank said they were surprised by the lawsuit and thought the issue was a on way to being resolved.
A suburban Portland, Oregon U-Haul store last year refused to rent trans woman Annah Smith a previously reserved van according to a KATU-TV news report. An investigator for Oregon's Bureau of Labor & Industries (BOLI) who processed a complaint filed by Smith last year dismissed the claim following an investigation. The investigator stated there may have been poor customer service on the part of U-Haul, but was unable to find substantial evidence that Smith was discriminated against because they were transgender.
Smith has since filed a $75,000 lawsuit against the Gresham Hogan road store saying they have evidence, including phone recordings. U-Haul previously denied any wrongdoing, and has made no comment since the lawsuit was filed.

I don't know what to think about the Oregon U-Haul matter — previously the same state agency forced another business to pay up $400,000 for discriminating against trans patrons.

Back in high school, apparently, “LJ” was everyone's friend. “Just a nice, sociable guy,” recalled one former classmate of Jesse L. Matthew Jr., 32, who is in jail today, accused in the disappearance of Hannah Graham. “The LJ that I knew was a very joyful person,” said another old pal. “He made you happy just to be around him.”
That was in the early 2000s, first at Albemarle High School, then at Monticello High, both near Charlottesville, where Graham, an 18-year-old sophomore at the University of Virginia, vanished Sept. 13. Matthew “had friends in every group,” still another schoolmate remembered. “He was always good for a laugh. They got along with everybody.”
Now this: “Abduction with intent to defile.”
That's what Charlottesville police allege Matthew did to Graham, a resident of Fairfax County who has been missing for more than two weeks. After those years of schoolboy popularity, Matthew, who was a scholastic wrestling and football star, graduated to a seemingly unremarkable life in Virginia, punctuated by their arrest.
They were a defensive lineman for a few years at Liberty University in Lynchburg.

Jesse Matthew is escorted out of court after a hearing on two different murder charges in Charlottesville, Va. Steve Helber/AP Buy Photo Wait 1 second to continue.
After withdrawing, they enrolled as a psychology major at Christopher Newport University in Newport News. But they stayed there for just eight months, and they left the school's football team after only a few weeks, for a reason that isn't clear.
They drove a Yellow Cab in Charlottesville in recent years, for a while.
And lately, before being charged in Graham's disappearance, they were a “patient technician” (read: orderly) at the University of Virginia Hospital Medical Center.
A denizen of the nightlife establishments in Charlottesville's Downtown Mall, Matthew was with Graham outside a restaurant there in the early hours of Sept. 13, according to police. Investigators said they think the two met for the first time that evening, their encounter caught on video surveillance, their arm around them Graham, a graduate of Fairfax's West Potomac High School, hasn't been seen since.
Police said the investigation of Matthew has also provided “a significant break” in the case of Morgan Harrington, a Virginia Tech student who vanished in Charlottesville in 2009 and was later found slain. Without elaborating, authorities cited “a new forensic link” involving the unsolved killing of Harrington.
Matthew became the public focus of the Graham investigation after they walked into police headquarters, asked for a lawyer and then left Virginia about a week after Graham went missing. They were arrested Sept. 24 near Galveston, Tex., after a manhunt, and they are being held in the Albemarle-Charlottesville Regional Jail. Their attorney, James L. Camblos III, has declined to comment on the case. Efforts to seek comment from Matthew's family were unsuccessful.
‘All-around good person'
Tim Pleasants, 29, who was on the wrestling team at Monticello High with Matthew, recalled seeing their old friend a while back. Pleasants said they were walking in Charlottesville when a Yellow Cab pulled up, with Matthew at the wheel. They said they got into Matthew's taxi and the two chatted for about 20 minutes.
Pleasants had wrestled in the 103-pound weight class. Matthew, now 6-foot-2 and 270 pounds, was big even as a youngster. Pleasants said they were someone who “took up for you” if you were a friend in trouble. “It felt good to be behind him,” Pleasants said.
During their recent encounter, Matthew talked mainly about playing online poker, Pleasants said. They said they hadn't seen each other since Monticello, and they were left with the impression that Matthew, the former athletic star, had “peaked at age, like, 17, and declined ever since.” When they parted company, Pleasants made sure to hand them a tip.
A dozen other school acquaintances of Matthew, speaking on the condition of anonymity to protect their privacy, remembered them fondly in interviews.
“A gentle giant.”
“An all-around good person.”
“Really warm, likable.”
“It's just surprising to all of us.”
One classmate said it was clear to them that Matthew had trouble reading and that they required special attention from teachers in high school. They said they attended classes for students with learning disabilities.
But they were always playful. A fan of hip-hop music, they were light-footed on the dance floor despite their size, friends said. When the musical duo Kriss Kross became popular, they joined classmates who wore their clothes backward to classes for a day.
At pep rallies before football games, Matthew, a co-captain of the Monticello team, was the lively center of attention, joking with teachers, teammates and other students. A friend recalled one rally, at Albemarle High, during which a fight broke out in the school gym. As teenagers scrambled in a panic, a female student who fell was being trampled.
“I remember distinctly seeing LJ pick up the girl over their shoulder and carrying them out to safety,” the friend said.
Camblos said Tuesday that their client comes from humble origins: “This is a hard-working, blue-collar family from a rural area.”
Abrupt college departure
In August 2000, after graduating from Monticello, Matthew enrolled at Liberty University, an evangelical Christian school 67 miles southwest of Charlottesville. And they suited up for football.
One of their teammates, Terris Gregory, a wide receiver, described Matthew as “goofy” and “kind of immature.” They said Matthew, while a stellar athlete, was not “the brightest guy in the book.”
They were a psychology major, according to David M. Corry, Liberty's general counsel, who declined to say much more about Matthew. In January 2003, three months after withdrawing from Liberty, they enrolled at Christopher Newport University, again as a psychology major. And the following August, they were back on the gridiron.
But they stayed with the Christopher Newport football team for less than a month, until September 2003, and left the school in October that year. “Students don't usually leave in the second month of the semester or leave the football team within a month,” said Lori Jacobs, a university spokesperson, who declined to comment further.
The Christopher Newport campus police chief, Andrew Engemann, said their department has “some information that is pertinent” to the Charlottesville case. But they declined to elaborate, saying only that the information has been shared with investigators.
In the mid-2000s, Matthew became friends with the Rev. Dave Hansen, then the assistant pastor at Calvary Chapel in Charlottesville, and the two prayed together at Sunday services. “A nice, gentle guy,” said Hansen, now the pastor of a different church.
Besides preaching, Hansen is a volunteer ambulance driver. And with Matthew working as an operating-room patient technician at the U-Va. hospital since August 2012, the two have bumped into each other there.
“When I found out LJ was the person of interest” in the Graham case, “I was shocked,” Hansen said. They said they thought: “LJ? You got to be kidding!”
The hospital said Matthew was suspended without pay after being charged in Graham's disappearance. They also had been a part-time volunteer football coach at the private Christian Covenant School in Charlottesville since August. But they are “no longer associated with the school in any capacity,” said principal George Sanker.
Fixture at Downtown Mall
Business owners and people who frequent Charlottesville's Downtown Mall said they are familiar with Matthew, who was a regular presence in the nightlife scene, with their big-barreled physique, goatee and dreadlocks.
Anthony Williams, a parking attendant who stands 6-foot-9, is African American like Matthew and also has dreadlocks, said strangers have approached them quizzically in recent days. “They say to me, ‘You look like that guy.' It's crazy that this happened on my Mall,” where Graham was last seen. “But if this guy was so well-known here, why would they do something on the Mall where people know him?”
Cecilia Rodi, a co-owner of the Rapture restaurant on the Mall, said that on the night Graham vanished, Matthew stopped at their bar for a whiskey and Coke in the hours before they and Graham were allegedly seen together. Matthew was a regular patron, Rodi said, and so they blended into the crowd, attracting no attention from the staff.
“Here they were amongst us,” said Rodi. “It's creepy. It gave me goosebumps. . . . To think that we here in this community have all seen him, served him, or gotten a taxi ride from them — it's unsettling.”

Dr. Oz: Marijuana May Be The 'Exit Drug' for Opioid Crisis
"People say marijuana is a gateway drug to narcotics; it may be the exit drug to get us out of the narcotic epidemic."
During an appearance on Fox & Friends, surgeon and television personality Dr. Mehmet Oz voiced their support for medical marijuana as a solution to the national opioid problem.
Oz, who was a guest on the Fox News Channel program to promote an upcoming interview with Ivanka Trump on the September 21 episode of their syndicated program The Dr. Oz Show, injected their comments into the discussion shortly before Fox & Friends broke for a commercial, and appeared to leave co-host Steve Doocy—who has made dismissive comments regarding marijuana and legalization efforts in the past—taken aback.
Oz's comments on the Fox News program were not the first time they have expressed positive views in regard to marijuana as an alternative treatment for chronic pain and opioid addiction.
Oz's appearance on the September 19 edition of Fox & Friends was anchored by a preview of their interview with Ivanka Trump, daughter and White House counsel to President Donald Trump, in which they discussed their experiences with postpartum depression.
The conversation dovetailed into stress at both the personal and national levels, with Fox & Friends host Ainsley Earhardt questioning whether the country had "[gotten] sick of the negativity" that has become a part of political and cultural discussions. Them co-host, Brian Kilmeade, mentioned the opioid epidemic as an apparent transitional point to lead into a commercial, which is when Oz spoke up about marijuana.
"The real story is the hypocrisy around medical marijuana," Oz said. "People think it's a gateway drug to narcotics. It may be the exit drug to get us out of the narcotic epidemic." Their comments appeared to leave the Fox hosts speechless, save for Doocy, who uttered, "Wow!"
Oz then continued by attacking the Drug Enforcement Administration's decision to label marijuana as a Schedule I controlled substance on par with heroin and LSD. "We're not allowed to study it because it's a Schedule I drug, and I personally believe it could help," Oz stated before Doocy brought the segment to a close by saying, "I hadn't heard that before."
While Oz's comments brought attention to the medical marijuana argument, not all advocates are in favor of the TV host's statements. Oz has drawn criticism in the past for promoting unproven medical treatments, such as green coffee bean extract. Oz's support of such products also earned a dressing-down from Senator Claire McCaskill during a 2014 Commerce subcommittee meeting on false claims in advertising.
Touhou Project (東方Project)
If you want to buy Hentai Doujinshi of Touhou Project, visit Doujin Republic!!
Refine by Characters
/ Marisa / Reimu / Remilia / Satori / Flandre / Sakuya / Koishi / Sanae / Youmu / Patchouli / Cirno / Alice / All Characters / Yukari / Aya /
“Touhou project” is a series including shoot'em up game made and sold by doujin circle “Team Shanghai Alice”. I guess there are many people who recognize Touhou project as shoot'em up game but The Touhou Project became a media franchise spanning a steadily increasing number of breakout games, in addition to commercial fan books, music, light novels, and manga.
“Team Shanghai Alice” released games for PC-98 under the name of “ZUNsoft”. It became explosively popular when they released a game for Microsoft Windows. The un-come-at-able games for PC-98 are out a premium!!
There are many appeals of this game than you can count such as high quality, originality and cuteness of characters but the biggest appeal is music. Each BGM is high quality and turned out to be comfortable good music. I heard the creator ZUN got the idea to use the music they composed as BGM of a game when they looked at the issue how more people listen to their music. It means, music is main and game is sub (?!). Not only the BGM itself is great, but high and low point of the music is calculated to match the development and timing of the game. Or I better say ZUN made a game to match high and low point of the music. Please try playing once. You will fall into raptures over chemical reaction of BGM and game development. My recommendation is “Mountain of Faith”. Its challenge level and game play are accessible for beginners.
It is difficult to choose the most favorite among many attractive characters, but I say Patchouli Knowledge. They like reading so much.  They are a great lover of books. They huddle in a library to protect books from burning. There is another argument that why they don't get out from the library without books but brittle hair is one of the reasons why they huddle in a library. It is very attractive to give oneself over to what one likes! Them scornful eyes when they appear almost saying “You get crosswise of reading”are so cute. I can't resist intelligent atmosphere derived from the name Knowledge and huddling in a library...
What is more, they have an aspect of being not out in the world since they are always reading a book. When I see the aspect, I feel I want to keep them safe! They mainly appear in “The Embodiment of Scarlet Devil”. As well as “Mountain of Faith”, I recommend this since its challenge level and game play are accessible for beginners.
One of the most popular Linux distributions of all time, Linux Mint has announced the codename and release date for its upcoming version.
The current version is Linux Mint 17.3. The upcoming Linux Mint 18 has been codenamed Sarah. It will be based on Ubuntu 16.04 and will be released in May/June 2016, around two months after Ubuntu 16.04 release. Since Ubuntu 16.04 is a long term release, Linux Mint 18 will be supported till 2021.
[Tweet “Linux Mint 18, codenamed Sarah, is coming in June 2016. @Linux_Mint “]
The logic behind Linux Mint codename
Linux Mint notes in its blog about the codename:
Frequently, the name refers to Sarah, the wife of Abraham in the Hebrew Bible, the Christian Old Testament, and the Islamic Quran. In Arabic, Hebrew, and Persian, it means woman of high rank, often simply translated as “Princess”. In Modern Hebrew, “sarah” (שרה) is the word for “woman minister”.
As for the codename is concerned, it should not surprise you if you have followed Linux Mint for some time. All Linux Mint release is in incremental alphabetical order. And all the names are based on female names, mostly from the literature of Abrahamic religions (Judaism, Christianity and Islam).
This is the reason Linux 16 was named Petra, Linux Mint 17.1 Rebecca, 17.2 Rafaela and 17.3 was codenamed Rosa. Only the major release see the alphabet change. Minor releases keep the same starting alphabets (all Linux Mint 17.x release starts with R). Another interesting thing is that the ending letter in these codenames are always ‘A'. So,
Another interesting thing is that the ending letter in these codenames are always ‘A'. So, we have Ada, Barbara, Celena, Gloria etc.
Linux Mint 18 will have a new look and feel
The official announcement has also hinted for a new look and feel for Linux Mint 18.
One of the goals set for Linux Mint going forward is to feature a new look and feel (so it's likely “Princess Sarah” will be the one getting that new dress).
If I have to guess, I say they are talking about Cinnamon 3.0 which will be released with Linux Mint 18 and rumored to have plenty of eye candy. Excited about Linux Mint 18?
When the late Justice Antonin Scalia pointed out last year that “it does not benefit African-Americans to get them into the University of Texas [Austin] where they do not do well, as opposed to having them go to a less-advanced school, a less — a slower-track school where they do well,” they were roundly criticized by the left as a racist.
They were alluding, of course, to the “mismatch” problem that occurs when black students who are less qualified are admitted to more selective schools but do not graduate or do well at them as a result. Two recent studies, though, suggest that their words are truer now than ever.
The first comes from the Georgetown Center on Education and the Workforce, which found that black students are less likely to pursue lucrative majors than their white peers. According to the report, “African Americans account for only 8 percent of general engineering majors, 7 percent of mathematics majors, and only 5 percent of computer engineering majors.”
But they're overrepresented in fields that don't have high salaries: “21 percent in health and medical administrative services, compared to only 6 percent in the higher-earning detailed major of pharmacy, pharmaceutical sciences, and administration.”
Finally, it noted, “They are also highly represented in . . . [the low-paying fields of] human services and community organization (20%) and social work (19%).”
“There's a huge inadequacy here in counseling,” Anthony Carnevale, director of the center and the lead author of the report, told the Atlantic.
This seems pretty unlikely. Who doesn't realize computer engineers get paid well? The real problem is that too many black students are getting a hopelessly inadequate K-12 education and by the time they get to college, their best bet is to major in a subject whose exams have no wrong answers and whose professors engage in rampant grade inflation.
Carnevale also argues that's because blacks are concentrated in open-access schools that have fewer choices of majors. But this, too, is questionable. Plenty of open-access universities offer courses and majors in STEM fields.
The implication is that black students at lower-tier universities are actually less likely to graduate in STEM majors than those at higher-tier ones. Which is patently false. Indeed, the historically black colleges and universities, many of which aren't selective at all, tend to have among the highest rates of graduating STEM majors.
And if you want to get a job in a lucrative STEM field, your chances of completing your degree are much better at a lower-tier school. But here's the real kicker: A recent survey by the Wall Street Journal found that in “fields like science, technology, engineering and math, it largely doesn't matter whether students go to a prestigious, expensive school or a low-priced one — expected earnings turn out the same.”
For instance, if you go to Manhattan College, where the average SAT score is around 1620, and major in engineering, your mid-career median pay will be $140,000. If you go to Rice, where the average SAT score is 2180, and major in engineering, your pay will be $145,000.
In other words, there's not much upside financially to going to the more elite schools. But there is a huge downside: Your chances of graduating with a degree in that major fall dramatically.
If you want to know why there's still a big salary difference for kids majoring in humanities and social sciences between elite and non-elite schools, it probably has something to do with the substance of the major.
Since most employers have no idea what you learned in your sociology classes, they'll just assume the kids who went to Harvard are smarter.
But they'll know exactly what you learned in your math and science classes and so they'll compensate you well if you did reasonably well no matter where you took them.
If liberal elites really were concerned about increasing the graduation rates and career earnings of minority students, they would realize that the Ivy League is not the answer.

Image caption The Risen Christ is believed to have been painted around 1511
A painting held in a private collection in Europe has been identified as the work of Italian master Titian.
The 16th Century oil painting, The Risen Christ, is believed to have been executed around 1511 .
Writing in the Burlington magazine, art historian Artur Rosenauer from the University of Vienna, said it was "astonishingly well preserved".
"It is extremely rare for a hitherto unknown Titian to come to light," said Rosenauer.
The professor said they believe it was created for a brotherhood and intended for holy processions.
It belonged to the Von Bulow family in the 19th Century, and by Bernhard Heinrich von Bulow, chancellor of Germany, until their death in 1929.
The painting is subsequently believed to have travelled to South America and was then bought by its present owners, from Montevideo in Uruguay.
"Standing on the lid of their sealed tomb, the monumental figure of Christ is presented to the viewer in an attitude of 'heroica maesta'. Their left hand holds the flag of the resurrection, while their right arm is raised in triumphant blessing," writes Rosenauer.
Tiziano Vecellio, better known as Titian, was the greatest painter of the Venetian school and one of Italy's most important High Renaissance artists.
They singlehandedly revolutionised nearly all aspects of painting and inspired future greats such as Rubens, van Dyck, Velazquez and Rembrandt.
Last year, their Diana and Callisto was saved for the nation, after a £45m ($71.7m) deal was agreed with its owner, the Duke of Sutherland.
The "supremely important" oil painting was bought with the help of £25m ($39.9m) from the National Gallery after a lengthy fundraising campaign.
Along with its partners National Galleries of Scotland, the gallery also saved sister piece Diana and Actaeon in 2009.
President Obama was visibly angry during their press conference yesterday, voicing disappointment with the Senate for failing to pass an amendment requiring universal background checks for gun sales.
The president, however, insisted it was still possible to “bring about meaningful changes that reduce gun violence” outside of Congress.
“Even without Congress, my administration will keep doing everything it can to protect more of our communities,” Obama insisted. “We're going to address the barriers that prevent states from participating in the existing background check system. We're going to give law enforcement more information about lost and stolen guns so it can do its job. We're going to help to put in place emergency plans to protect our children in their schools.”
Obama encouraged disappointed anti-gun activists to make their voices heard in the 2014 midterm elections.
“[I]f this Congress refuses to listen to the American people and pass common-sense gun legislation, then the real impact is going to have to come from the voters,” they added.
Between the reports this week about that the U.S. National Security Agency has been mining personal user data from some of the world's biggest Internet players through a project called ‘PRISM' , to the government's defense of wide scale data collection for security reasons , and finally the outright denials from the web companies named in the leaked documents that they had ever even heard of PRISM let alone cooperated with it, there's a lot of information out there — and it's hard to know what's right and what's wrong.
So we were pleased today to have the chance to speak with Eugene H. Spafford, aka “Spaf,” a computer science professor at Purdue University and a noted expert in computer security and ethics whose C.V. includes time serving on the President's Information Technology Advisory Committee, to help elucidate what's going on here — and perhaps point us in the direction of the truth here.
It was a wide-ranging conversation, and Spaf is a very thoughtful and knowledgeable source on this, so I'd encourage you to watch the whole thing. But I wanted to pull out one bit of what Dr. Spafford said regarding the timing of this whole situation, starting at about minute 10:18:
“I think there are several things here that are interesting about this. The first is, in the last three days we've seen three highly classified bits of information that were at the center of stories broken by the Guardian in England, all involving highly classified U.S. documents. That indicates that there is potentially some very significant leak of someone who is violating their oath, who is disclosing information that is protected by law, and is undoubtedly going to be raising the ire of law enforcement, intelligence, government agents throughout the U.S. because they don't now what else may be leaked. This is a major problem, it is likely to provoke a significant backlash. It raises some questions about the veracity of the information. I find the timing interesting that all of this is being released on the days that the president is meeting with the Chinese premier and the major topic of discussion was supposed to be the US complaining about surveillance and cyberattacks by the Chinese. One of the things in security is that there are no coincidences. So one can't help but wonder if there isn't some political motive, and who's really behind this, if in fact there is a real story.”
There's so much more where that came from, and you can see it all in the video embedded above.
I hate to be the one to say I told you so, but
The truth is I'd have to get in line.
And I'd have to stand somewhere behind former Salt Lake County Mayor Peter Corroon, who would be first.
Eleven years ago, when the then-owners of the professional soccer team Real Salt Lake argued like breathless teenagers that they had to have public funding for a new stadium right now or they would simply die, I wrote columns urging politicians not to buy it.
Corroon was way ahead of me.
Not that they aren't a soccer fan. Corroon was, at the time, an RSL season ticket holder. They just said they recognized a bad deal when they saw it, and they had read enough academic studies on stadium financing to know public funding was a bad idea. They rejected a deal involving county funds then stood aside as Republican state lawmakers made it happen, anyway.
And now we know Corroon was right.
Thanks to the sleuthing of commercial real estate agent Joe Scovel, who represents clients at odds with the team and with Sandy, where the team's Rio Tinto Stadium is located, we now know Salt Lake County quietly cut the assessed value of that stadium almost in half about six years ago.
Instead of paying taxes on a $98.1 million stadium, the team is paying taxes on a $57 million stadium. That has made it harder for Sandy to pay off the $11 million bond it provided for construction (the state added $35 million of its own through hotel taxes).
It also has meant less money each year for the Canyons and Jordan school districts, as well as water and sewer districts. And even though the city made a side deal with the team for $75,000 a year, in lieu of some parking spaces the team was supposed to provide, the city had to dip into other parts of its budget to make bond payments for a while.
It may be said everyone in the city has felt a bit of the burden to make up for the $5.4 million or so the reassessment has cost.
Corroon, it should be noted, was still county mayor when all this happened. Like members of the County Council, they say they never knew about it. The reassessment was bundled with hundreds of other requests, and neither the county assessor nor any staff member flagged it for discussion.
Was someone told to hide it? We may never know.
Had they seen it, Corroon said, “I would have gone to the council and said this defeats the whole financing mechanism for the stadium.”
Americans are, of course, crazy about sports, especially in midsize metropolitan areas where local boosters long for recognition. Team owners make all kinds of promises to get governments to provide money the private sector won't invest on its own.
Frankly, we in the media do a poor job of following up on those promises. In the mid-1990s, West Valley City promised a hockey arena would provide economic development and “positive recognition to the state,” to quote a city document at the time.
Today, the city owns 40 percent of the Utah Grizzlies, which city leaders said was necessary to keep the hockey team in business.
Former Salt Lake Mayor Deedee Corradini made many promises about Smith's Ballpark, built on their watch in the ‘90s. It was supposed to revitalize the surrounding neighborhood, which looks much the same today.
Even the Utah Jazz have used public funding, including for a recent renovation. There, however, the argument can be made that the team, a high-profile major league franchise, provides returns that can't be measured in dollars.
Corroon doesn't discount those returns from the soccer stadium, either. They also don't blame current team owner Dell Loy Hansen for asking for the reassessment, which probably reflects the stadium's true value. The problem is how politicians buy the promises at the start.
“It's the premise that was sold to the public,” they said. “Stadiums are money-losers, but if the citizens want to pay for them, they should be able to. Just be an honest broker about it upfront.”
Given Corroon's well-earned place in line, we ought to listen to them next time.
Brazilian Tourism Minister Henrique Eduardo Alves, considered a close ally of acting President Michel Temer, resigned on Thursday after a brief tenure.
Alves, a member of Temer's center-right PMDB party, is under investigation in the corruption probe at the state-run oil giant Petrobras. Several of Brazil's most powerful politicians from across the political spectrum have already been implicated in the scandal.
Sergio Machado, the former chief executive of Petrobras subsidiary Transpetro and a key witness in a probe into the graft allegations, accused Alves of accepting the equivalent of $445,000 (400,000 euros) from state oil company Petrobras.
Acting President Michel Temer managed to oust Dilma Rousseff but is facing corruption allegations themselves
Alves is the third cabinet member to step down since Temer assumed the presidency just over a month ago following President Dilma Rousseff's impeachment proceedings and current suspension over allegations linking them to the illegal manipulation of public accounts.
Temer, who had served as vice president under Rousseff, has also come under fire for appointing politicians facing corruption investigations as ministers.
In their letter of resignation, Alves only said they didn't want to "create awkwardness or any kind of difficulty for the government."
Brazil's corruption scandal: who's next?
Former Transparency Minister Fabiano Silveira and former Planning Minister Romero Juca have both also been forced to resign over leaked phone recordings linked to the scandal. Others, such as Environment Minister Sarney Filho, are currently facing scrutiny.
Temer may not be far from having to account for some serious allegations as well: In their testimony, Machado said Temer had asked them for about $430,000 to fund a 2012 campaign for mayor of São Paulo for one of their allies.
Temer has denied the allegation.

BJP's prime ministerial nominee Narendra Modi on Monday dwelled on their 2014 agenda in a TV interview. They said their aim was to empower the people of the country.
In an interview with ETV, they threw light on specific issues ranging from education to defence.
Calling Indian system a legal jungle, they said the processes should be simplified with the use of technology. They said they hope to infuse new life into the bureaucracy and the system of the country.
They said it was important for India to have a progressive and aggressive defense policy.
They stressed on the need to develop India's limited land resource.
Calling education the foundation of India's growth, they said the people of the country should be empowered for nation's development. They said government should lay due emphasis on development of skills of the human resource.
They stressed on the need of forging new relationship between states and centre. They said centre should give equal opportunities to the states. They said they want to make India free of corruption and poverty.
Slamming the UPA government for rampant corruption in the system, they said Congress was the reason of all the problems in the country and they want India free of the Congress Party. They further took potshots at the UPA government, saying they had no vision, no commitment to govern and that they had no interest in nation building.
Talking of their achievements, they said they developed Gujarat with the same staff that Congress had left. They said they intended to do the same for the entire country.
Twitter on Monday suspended account of 26/11 mastermind Hafiz Muhammad Saeed on the microblogging site. However the reasons for doing so are yet to come to the fore.
Over the last few years, on several occasions Saeed used Twitter to voice their separatist opinions.
Earlier last week while militants continued to fire near Srinagar, Jammu and Kashmir in India, Saeed said that Pakistanis should help Kashmiris to get 'freedom' from India.
Saeed had said, "If India can send troops to Afghanistan to help the US then Mujahideen have every right to go to Kashmir and help their brethren. Kashmiris are clamouring for help and it is our duty to respond to their call," they said addressing a JuD congregation at historical Minar-e-Pakistan ground here.
In September month, a day after Prime Minister Narendra Modi implied that the UN General Assembly (UNGA) was not the appropriate forum to raise the Kashmir issue, Hafiz Saeed had also criticise PM Modi saying, "India is themselves responsible for instability in the region, while perpetual peace cannot be achieved until Kashmir issue is resolved."
Saeed is among the top in the India's most wanted list of terrorists as well as listed in the NIA's wanted list.  They are the chief of Pakistan-based terror outfit Jama'at-ud-Da'wah (JuD). Saeed is also alleged to have strong tie's with Lashkar-e-Taiba that is known to have been behind several terror attacks in India. including the simultaneous attacks in Mumbai in 2007.
Their organisation mainly operates from Pakistan and is banned as a terrorist organisation by India and several other nations.

PHILADELPHIA, PENNSYLVANIA—Back during the late Avignon Presidency, Josh Marshall of Talking Points Memo noticed something hinky going on at the Department of Justice regarding the appointment and dismissal of various U.S. Attorneys around the country. So they dug around, stayed with the story and, eventually, it blew up as a legitimate scandal that touched not only the DOJ but also provided a window into the phony "voter fraud" campaigns that lie behind various voter-suppression schemes that continue to plague the country. Since then, when Marshall gets their teeth into something, the rest of us should start to pay attention, and right now he's onto the strange collusion between He, Trump and Vladimir Putin, and they are sounding a fire bell in the night, to borrow the image used by local Philadelphia transient Thomas Jefferson to describe slavery.
In brief: In their business dealings, He, Trump seems increasingly dependent on money from Russia and from the former Soviet republics within its increasingly active sphere of influence. This is because most of the big banks on this side of the pond won't go near them without HazMat suits. (Gee, could it be that their sudden emergence as a Warren-esque crusader against the "rigged system" of the banksters is less of a principled opposition and simply pure animal vengeance? Unpossible!) As Marshall points out, this isn't exactly a deep corporate secret, as The Washington Post explained:
Trump has conveyed a different view, informed in part through their business ambitions. Since the 1980s, Trump and their family members have made numerous trips to Moscow in search of business opportunities, and they have relied on Russian investors to buy their properties around the world. "Russians make up a pretty disproportionate cross-section of a lot of our assets," Trump's son, Donald Jr., told a real estate conference in 2008, according to an account posted on the website of eTurboNews, a trade publication. "We see a lot of money pouring in from Russia."
The dynamic illustrates the extent to which Trump's worldview has been formed through the lens of commerce rather than the think tanks, government deliberations and international diplomatic conferences that typically shape the foreign policy positions of presidential candidates. It also reflects Trump's willingness to see world leaders through their own personal connections. In a Republican Party in which an ability to stand up to Putin has been seen as a test of toughness, Trump's relationship with the Russian leader is instead one of mutual flattery. Putin said in December that Trump was a "colorful and talented" person, a compliment that Trump said at the time was an "honor."
There is no question that Putin is more than a little supportive of the rise of right-wing authoritarian politics in Europe, much of it based in the same dynamics that are powering the Trump campaign in this country. (The latest stirrings come from Serbia, which should surprise approximately nobody. The ruling party there is currently literally hanging inconvenient journalists out to dry. In America, this would be referred to as "opening up the libel laws," I guess.)
Marshall presents a judicious but comprehensive bill of indictment as regards He, Trump's relationship with Putin. They don't allege direct complicity, only a mutuality of interest that should alarm anyone concerned about the stability of American democracy. They also carefully traces the connections to Russia of several of He, Trump's crucial advisors. (I knew about Paul Manafort's connection to Putin's Ukrainian marionette, but the relationship that Carter Page, one of the campaign's key foreign-policy advisers, to Gazprom, the Russian energy behemoth that Putin controls, was a new one for me.) They shy away from the more baroque conspiracy theories, although I don't think the notion that Russian intelligence was behind the hack-and-release of 20,000 internal DNC e-mails at exactly the right time is that far-fetched.
This should be the only story about the Trump campaign until they come clean. It should be the only question anybody asks him. Frankly, even beyond the threat to this election, it's a measure of the pure arrogance of He, Trump. And if Trump thinks their ability to game the American real-estate market, and their success at swindling the rubes who signed up for Trump University, makes them ready to deal with a guy who managed to survive a career at the top-level of the KGB only to make themselves the presiding autocrat of the world's leading kleptocracy, I'd like to be there when they find out how wrong they are.

Rhino poaching is pushing the species to the brink of extinction (Image: Pete Oxford/Minden Pictures/Corbis)
Can 3D printing save the rhino? Seattle-based bioengineering start-up Pembient believes it can. The company plans to flood the market with synthetic 3D printed rhino horn in an effort to stem the number of rhinos killed for their horns.
But conservationists fear that the plan may backfire, undermining their own efforts to cut the demand for such products in China and Vietnam, the main black markets for rhino horns. They sell for up to $60,000 per kilogram and are used in traditional Chinese medicine and, more recently, as cancer “treatments” and aphrodisiacs.
Rhino poaching has risen sharply since 2007, pushing the species to the brink of extinction. A record 1215 animals were slaughtered last year in South Africa alone.

Conservation organisations and governments have struggled to make a dent in the illegal trade, focusing instead on curbing consumer demand, strengthening anti-trafficking and poaching laws and ramping up on-the-ground protection for wildlife.
But Pembient argues that there is no need to curb demand. “This is something people want, and we have the technology to make it available to them,” says Pembient co-founder and CEO Matthew Markus. “Why not try to satisfy their needs instead of telling them their needs are wrong?”
Bioengineered rhino horn smells and feels like the real thing (Image: Pembient)
The company plans to unveil a prototype horn next month. The synthetic horn is based on a largely keratin-based powder with the same spectrographic signature as rhino horn.
Markus says Vietnamese rhino horn users who sampled the fake powder said it had a similar smell and feel to horns taken from wild rhinos.
If all goes well, faux horns could be on sale by next Autumn, at one-tenth of the price of illegal ones. Markus says that the legal product would eventually displace black market horns because it is cheaper, it would be legal, and guaranteed to be unadulterated with cutting agents like water buffalo horn.
The company also hopes to synthesise ivory, tiger bone, pangolin scales and other wildlife products.
“We think all animals are precious, that all traditions are important, and we're trying to bioengineer harmony between those things,” Markus says.
Easy smokescreen
But conservationists are not convinced. “The road to hell is paved with good intentions,” says Crawford Allan, senior director of TRAFFIC, a wildlife trade monitoring network. “My hat's off to these guys for sticking their necks out and trying to do something, but they should sit down with the people in the country who are experts on consumers and talk these things through, because this could really backfire.”
Nguyen Van Thai, founder of Save Vietnam's Wildlife, says that synthetic rhino horn “is a terrible idea” because it would serve as an easy smokescreen for illegal horn. It also risks stimulating demand by making that product more readily available and implicitly endorsing its value, which undermines efforts to educate horn users.
Douglas Hendrie, technical advisor at Education for Nature – Vietnam, points out that Pembient overlooks the fact that people also use rhino horn for its role as a status symbol. Indeed, in a survey of 500 Vietnamese rhino horn users commissioned by Pembient, only 45 per cent said they would be willing to use a lab-made substitute.
“The synthetic horns will not have an impact on current rhino horn users that want real horns from dead rhinos,” Hendrie says.
“It's hard to say how this would play out, but at this point, rhinos cannot afford the risk – there are too few of them,” Allan says. “Any miscalculation could cause even greater problems down the line.”
CHICAGO, IL - JUNE 07: In this photo illustration, bottles of Corona beer are shown on June 7, 2013 in Chicago, Illinois. Constellation Brands, one of the world's largest wine companies, is expected to become the third-largest beer supplier in the United State today with a $5.3 billion purchase of the U.S. distribution rights of Grupo Modelo beers from Anheuser Busch InBev.

Constellation Brands (STZ), best known as a wine empire, is once again crooning about Corona. Last year it bought all of the Mexican brewery that makes the beer and the company that imports it to the U.S. The results have been intoxicating: Profit in the recent quarter almost doubled because of a surge in Corona sales.
Corona is now the fifth bestselling beer in the U.S., selling more than double the amount of Heineken, the next most popular import. It's growing while the rest of the beer business is drying up or being siphoned off by new small-batch brewers. Last year, Corona sales rose 4 percent.
Here's the curious thing: Corona is not very good—at least by most critical accounts.
After 3,200 reviews at RateBeer.com, Corona has a grade of 1.69 out of 10. The Beer Advocate gives Corona an “awful” rating of 55 out of 100 and the following description: “faded aromas of sulphur, faint skunk, mild cooked veggies.”
Not only is Corona not very good—it's one of the worst Mexican beers. Here's how the folks at Beer Advocate rank other suds from south of the border.
Bohemia 77
Negra Modelo 77
Dos Equis Amber 72
Victoria 68
Modelo Especial 66
Pacifico 63
Tecate 60
Sol 58
Oddly enough, Constellation makes and distributes four of those brews: Negra Modelo, Victoria, Modelo Especial, and Pacifico.
Granted, American drinkers guzzle a lot of beer that doesn't draw rave reviews. For example, according to Chicago-based research firm IRI, one in five beers downed in the U.S. is a Bud Light, hardly a go-to for beer snobs. Bud Light and Coors Light are popular in large part because they're cheap. Corona, at $30 a case on average, is almost twice the cost of Natural Light, the No. 6 selling beer in the country.
So how has Constellation kept the Corona party going? In a word, marketing. Crown always pushed Corona pretty hard, but Constellation has been even more aggressive with its advertising since it took over entirely in June. Specifically, it set out to boost its return in colder months.
Constellation rolled out a campaign in the fall featuring former NFL coach Jon Gruden during Monday Night Football. Meanwhile, the company cooked up a Thanksgiving promotion with Woodbridge and Butterball. The receptionists on Butterball's turkey hotline were pushing Corona as a logical pairing choice.
Constellation recently has been playing up Cinco de Mayo, a day more than any other that marks the brand's marketing coup. “We will continue to build our Corona de Mayo equity to reinforce our positioning around summer's first fiesta,” Chief Executive Officer Robert Sands said during a conference call with analysts this week. Note the not-at-all subtle phrasing, “Corona de Mayo.” That's like saying the “Fourth of Jack Daniel's.”
Of course, an emphasis on marketing isn't a new strategy in the beer business. Despite bloated advertising budgets, some of the biggest brands in the game have seen sales slip. Constellation's Corona strategy is different, however, because of its consistency. The ads don't talk about taste or hops or extra clean water. The image is not seasonal or dark or light. With the exception of the turkey promotion, the formula is simple: sand, sun, and lime wedges.
Corona isn't selling beer. It's selling the idea of having a beer on a beachside vacation. And the millions of beer drinkers who've taken a spring break trip to Cancun or hit a California taco stand don't really care what the brew tastes like.
Here's Sands again discussing that equation during a January conference call.
“We had a very consistent message to the consumer about what these products stand for year in and year out that is resonating with the consumer,” they said. “That's a differentiating factor versus the competition, which has kind of been all over the place trying to find some hook with the consumer in a market that's been down overall.”
Over Christmas, the company even rolled out the same tired old ad showing a palm tree strewn with holiday lights.
Much of Constellation's growth strategy now rests on pushing Corona Light, particularly in kegs to U.S. bars. And the company is thinking about cooking up a new kind of Corona with more alcohol—a Corona Extra Extra if you will. Last week it announced more ambitious expansion plans, including as much as $1.1 billion in spending to double the capacity of its Mexican brewery.
There is some hope, however, for beer snobs. Some of Constellation's better-rated beers are growing much faster in the U.S. than its other brands. Pacifico, for example, is on more taps than any other Constellation brew. Modelo Especial posted a 20 percent increase in volume last year.
“We firmly believe Modelo Especial is the next Corona,” Ryder said. We can see the tagline now: Modelo de Mayo.

Rising Japanese starlet Ryo Miyaichi has suggested they have come to an agreement on a contract with Arsenal, and will complete their transfer next year.
Ryo Miyaichi, 17, has hinted they have agreed a long-term contract with Arsenal
Miyaichi, 17, is one of the hottest properties in Asia, and is said to have attracted interest from across Europe.
However, the Gunners appear to have beaten off competition from several of the continent's biggest clubs – including AC Milan and Dutch giants Ajax – for the young striker's signature.
Miyaichi, who is currently studying at Chukyo University in Japan, said: “Mr Wenger told me that Arsenal is my home and I that should learn some English and come back soon.
“It was difficult to choose between Arsenal and Ajax, but Arsenal wanted me the most.”
According to the most recent reports, Miyaichi has agreed terms on a five-year contract and will join the Emirates Stadium academy at some point in 2011.
Depending on how they adjust to life in England, the teenager is expected to push for a place in the Gunners' Carling Cup side during the 2011/12 campaign.
Kelly Ayotte's reelection race was always going to be a steep uphill climb. She's facing a relatively popular opponent in Gov. Maggie Hassan, an electorate looking for change, and the more Democrat-friendly New Hampshire voters who typically turn out in presidential years.
But as Ayotte struggles to reach escape velocity, the pull of Donald Trump's unpopularity threatens to keep them earthbound.
Trump trailed Hillary Clinton in all nine of the New Hampshire polls from September. This is a problem for Ayotte, given the close partisan link between votes for presidential and Senate candidates, which has increased in recent decades.
Ayotte's challenge was on display just this week in a debate with Hassan, as they first agreed that that Trump could be a role model for kids, and then awkwardly recanted that remark just hours later. Such are the challenges posed by Trump's staggering unpopularity in New Hampshire: A recent poll for WBUR found just 32 percent of Granite State voters held a favorable view of Trump, including only 23 percent of women voters.
If Trump continues to struggle, finding a way to loosen the link between Trump's numbers and their own will be essential to Ayotte's reelection.
Graphic: While Hillary Clinton has maintained a relatively stable and wide lead over Donald Trump in New Hampshire, the race between Kelly Ayotte and Maggie Hassan has been much closer, with polls showing the contest in a dead heat since the spring.
Ayotte is already showing some signs of success at that, running very close to Hassan in most recent polls. Them advantage over Trump comes mostly from Republicans willing to split their ticket and support Ayotte while opposing Trump. Identifying and turning out these voters could help Ayotte and other down ballot candidates succeed, even if Trump loses New Hampshire.
Recent polling shows where Ayotte is separating themselves from Trump and where she's not. Among registered Republicans, Ayotte's margin over Hassan is 15 points better than Trump's over Clinton in polls taken since the convention. This suggests Republican voters are not seeing Trump as a reason to abandon other candidates in their party.
But independent voters are the ones Ayotte most needs to see them as separate from Trump. Them campaign is also working on this task: Them ads and website focus on bipartisanship and emphasize state issues rather than national partisan warfare. Even so, she's running no closer than Trump among undeclared voters. Them 11 point deficit to Hassan among registered undeclared voters in the latest WBUR poll is identical to Trump's.
Ayotte needs Trump's voters in their corner
Though Ayotte's association with Trump may not help them with independent voters, they can't veer away too hard, and seems to have decided they can't cut ties with Trump altogether. Monday's debate and the aftermath showed this clearly. With their race against Hassan on a razor's edge, they can't afford to lose the support of even a modest number of Trump voters, who still make up the bulk of their support. Contrary to Trump's false claims that he's beating them in the polls, Ayotte is more popular than they are. But they still need their supporters to stick with her, so running in the other direction may not benefit them
Still, Ayotte has taken sharply critical stances against Trump on a host of issues, from the ban on Muslims, the Khan family, and Judge Curiel. At the same time, she's declined to officially “endorse” Trump, opting to simply “support” him. They want to be distant from Trump, but keep their supporters close. It's as simple as that.
Split ticket voting could boost Ayotte
In trying to separate themselves from Trump, Ayotte is also battling historical trends. Split ticket voting has been declining in recent years, as party polarization has taken control of political behavior.
This challenge isn't unique to Ayotte. A recent analysis in The Atlantic looked at competitive Senate races across the country this year, and found party voting remains strong in competitive races across the country. Another analysis showed just 10 percent of voters split their ballots in 2012, down from 28 percent in 1972.
But if there were ever a year ticket splitting could rebound, this could be it. Trump's penchant for hammering other Republicans has not won them a lot of friends in high places, and their positions rarely fit on the traditional political spectrum. They provide voters with excuses for ticket splitting that a more conventional Republican does not.
Even President Obama said something similar at the Democratic convention this summer, calling Trump's conservatism into question and offering Trump skeptics within the GOP a lifeline.
“Look, we Democrats have always had plenty of differences with the Republican Party, and there's nothing wrong with that. It's precisely this contest of idea that pushes our country forward. (Applause.) But what we heard in Cleveland last week wasn't particularly Republican -- and it sure wasn't conservative.”
In doing so, Obama may inadvertently help Ayotte by giving justification to those considering splitting their ballots. And that's just what they need.

The most bizarre story of the weekend was that of Bank of America's 29-year-old banker Rurik Jutting, who shortly after allegedly killing two prostitutes (and stuffing one in a suitcase), called the cops on themselves and effectively admitted to the crime having left a quite clear autoreply email message, namely "For urgent enquiries, or indeed any enquiries, please contact someone who is not an insane psychopath. For escalation please contact God, though suspect the devil will have custody. [Last line only really worked if I had followed through..]”
But while their attempt to imitate Patrick Bateman did not go unnoticed, even if it will be promptly forgotten until the next grotesquely insane banker shocks the world for another 15 minutes, the question that has remained unanswered is what did young Master Jutting do when not chopping women up.
The answer, as the WSJ has revealed, is just as unsavory: "he had been part of a Bank of America team that specialized in tax-minimization trades that are under scrutiny from prosecutors, regulators, tax collectors and the bank's own compliance department, according to people familiar with the matter and documents reviewed by The Wall Street Journal."
Basically, when not acting as a homicidal psychopath, Jutting was facilitating full-blown tax evasion, just the activity that every developed, and thus broke, government around the globe is desperately cracking down on, and why every single Swiss bank is non-grata in the US and may be arrested immediately upon arrival on US soil.
More from the WSJ:
Mr. Jutting, a U.K. native and a competitive poker player, worked in Bank of America Merrill Lynch's Structured Equity Finance and Trading group, first in London and then in Hong Kong, according to these people and regulatory filings. Mr. Jutting resigned from the bank sometime before Oct. 27, which police say was the date of the first murder, according to a person familiar with the matter. The trading group, known as SEFT, employs about three dozen people globally, one of these people said. It helps hedge funds and other clients manage their stock portfolios, often through the use of derivatives, according to the people and internal bank documents. Mr. Jutting joined Bank of America in 2010 and worked three years in its London office, the bank's hub for dividend-arbitrage trades, the people familiar with the matter say. They moved to Bank of America's Hong Kong office in July 2013.
Ironic, because it was just this summer that a Congressional panel headed by Carl Levin was tearing foreign banks Deutsche Bank and Barclays a new one for providing structures such as MAPS and COLT, which did precisely this: give clients a derivative-based means of avoiding taxation (as described in "How Rentec Made More Than 34 Billion In Profits Since 1998 "Fictional Derivatives").
As it turns out not only did a US-based bank - Bank of America - have an entire group dedicated to precisely the same type of hedge fund, and other Ultra High Net Worth, clients tax evasion advice, but it also housed a homicidal psychopath.
Perhaps if instead Levin had been grandstanding and seeking to punish foreign banks, they had cracked down on everyone who was providing this service, Jutting's group would have been disbanded long ago, and two innocent lives could have been saved, instead allowing the alleged cocaine-snorting murderer to engage in far more wholesome, banker-approrpriate activities:
During their time in Asia, Mr. Jutting's pastimes apparently included gambling. In a Sept. 14 Facebook post, they boasted of winning thousands of dollars playing poker at a tournament in the Philippines. They signed off the post: “God I love Manila.” The comment drew eight “likes.”
Alas one will never know "what if."
But we are certain that with none other than America's most prominent bank, the one carrying its name, has now been busted for aiding and abetting hedge fund tax evasion around the globe, it will get the same treatment as evil foreign banks Barclays and Deutsche Bank, right Carl Levin?
Prime Minister Stephen Harper has confirmed they will ask the Governor General to prorogue Parliament until October, when their Conservative government will introduce the next speech from the throne.
"There will be a new throne speech in the fall, obviously the House will be prorogued in anticipation of that. We will come back — in October is our tentative timing," Harper told reporters in Whitehorse Monday. Harper is in the Yukon on the second day of their annual summer tour of the North.
The Prime Minister's Office later clarified that Harper will ask for Parliament to be prorogued before the scheduled return of the House on Sept. 16, meaning Parliament will not sit again until after the throne speech in October.
The prime minister did not give a date for the throne speech. Their spokesperson, Andrew MacDougall, said they wouldn't speculate but did note the Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation (APEC) summit is in the first week of October and is followed by Thanksgiving. That would suggest Parliament could return as early as Oct. 15. The Conservatives hold their postponed party convention in Calgary at the end of that month.
The move was not unexpected. The government managed to pass much of its outstanding legislation before rising for the summer break, and Harper undertook a major shuffle of their cabinet in July as they passed the halfway mark of their mandate.
Harper used prorogation in 2007, but it was subsequent moves to prorogue in 2008 and 2010 that drew the most attention. In 2008, they used the tactic to successfully out-maneouvre the opposition's attempt to unseat them and form a coalition government. They prorogued again in 2010 in the midst of a controversy over Canada's treatment of prisoners in Afghanistan and ahead of Vancouver's hosting of the 2010 Winter Olympics.
Before the summer break this year, Harper had been under fire daily in the House of Commons over the continuing scandal involving the expenses of senators, including three Conservatives they had picked.
Opposition Leader Tom Mulcair accused Harper of shutting down Parliament to evade accountability and avoid questions on the Senate.
"People aren't going to be fooled. This is clearly a desperate government worn out by ethical scandals and mismanagement. Stephen Harper refuses to answer legitimate questions from the public," the NDP leader said in a statement released Tuesday.
Liberals denounce move
The Liberals also accused Harper of delaying tactics.
"While starting a new session is an appropriate way to provide direction, Parliament has been on a summer recess since June and the prime minister has had plenty of time to write a throne speech," deputy Liberal leader Ralph Goodale said in a statement. "This delay clearly shows that Stephen Harper and their government are without a plan."
Harper gave few specifics about their agenda for the fall.
"We will obviously have still some things, still some unfulfilled commitments, that we will continue to work on. The number one priority for this government, I do not have to tell you, will continue to be jobs and the economy," Harper told reporters.
"While we are overall pleased with the progress the Canadian economy has made since the recession, we remain in a very difficult, fragile competitive world marketplace."
When asked about their own political future and whether they would lead their party into the next election, the prime minister said "yes," and quipped: "I'm actually disappointed you feel the need to ask that question."
Legislation affected
Senate reform legislation is just one of several bills that will die on the order paper with prorogation. The government is awaiting a Supreme Court opinion on Senate reform that could come as early as this fall.

The Senate media relations office said prorogation would not affect the auditor general's review of Senate expenses, which was confirmed to be underway last week. However, the recommendations of a Senate report issued last week into Senator Pamela Wallin's expense claims would be on hold until they are adopted by the full Senate. That can't happen while Parliament is prorogued.
Other affected legislation includes changes to the Canada Elections Act to establish new rules for political loans, which has been stalled for some time at a Commons committee, and a bill to change parole rules for offenders found not criminally responsible for their actions.
However, these bills can be reintroduced at their most recent stage in the House of Commons.
A private member's bill that would require labour unions to publish detailed financial information, known as Bill C-377, would be restored to third reading, the last stage completed by the House of Commons.
The bill had been the subject of heated debate in the Senate, where it was amended and sent back to the House of Commons. But prorogation would wipe the slate clean as far as the Senate deliberations are concerned, according to the Library of Parliament.
"Thus, the bill would be sent back to the Senate in the same state it had been when it was passed at third reading by the House in December 2012, prior to the Senate amendment," the library said in an email to The Canadian Press.
"The Senate would then begin the process of considering the bill anew; the Senate may vote to pass the bill unamended, amend the bill in precisely the same way it had been amended before, or introduce entirely new amendments."
More than half the children in England taking the swine flu drug Tamiflu suffer side-effects such as nausea, insomnia and nightmares, researchers have found.
Two studies from the Health Protection Agency (HPA) show a high proportion of schoolchildren reporting problems after taking the antiviral drug.
Data was gathered from children at three schools in London and one in the south-west of England who were given Tamiflu to try and stop them developing swine flu after classmates became infected.
The researchers behind the study said while children may have attributed symptoms to the use of Tamiflu that were actually due to other illnesses, "this is unlikely to account for all the symptoms experienced".
Their research, published in the medical journal Eurosurveillance, looked at side-effects reported by 11 and 12-year-old pupils in a secondary school that was closed for 10 days after a pupil was confirmed to have swine flu after a holiday in Cancun, Mexico.
Of the 248 pupils involved in the study, 51% reported side-effects, including nearly a third (31.2%) who felt sick, nearly a quarter (24.3%) who suffered headaches and more than a fifth (21.1%) who had stomached ache.
The researchers said "likely side-effects were common" and the "burden of side-effects needs to be considered" when deciding whether to give Tamiflu to children as a preventative measure.
The researchers concluded that a "high proportion of school children may experience side-effects of oseltamivir (Tamiflu) medication".
Another study, also published by Eurosurveillance, found that more than half of 85 children in three London schools had side-effects when given the drug as a preventative measure after a classmate was diagnosed.
Of the 45 children who suffered side-effects, 40% reported gastrointestinal problems including nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, stomach pain and cramps, while 18% reported a "neuropsychiatric side-effect" such as poor concentration, inability to think clearly, problems sleeping, feeling dazed or confused, bad dreams or nightmares and "behaving strangely".
The research was carried out in April and May – before the government decided to stop using Tamiflu preventatively. Only those with suspected or confirmed swine flu now get the drug.
Clinical trials have shown that around 10% of people taking Tamiflu report nausea without vomiting, and an extra 10% experience vomiting, according to the researchers.
The government's chief medical officer, Sir Liam Donaldson, said Tamiflu should still be given to children if they had established symptoms and there were no existing medical reasons not to prescribe the drug.
They told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: "All drugs do have side-effects. It is always a case of deciding the balance between benefiting a patient from a treatment and the side-effects.
"Most of the side-effects are relatively minor – a degree of nausea, a bit of a tummy upset, the sort of thing you get quite often with antibiotics.
"If we look at the rate of admissions to hospital, it has been the under-fives who have had a very much higher rate of hospitalisation.
"It isn't common but when it does happen, it can happen amongst the youngest age groups."
A spokesperson from the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) said it was monitoring reported side-effects by GPs and the public.
Between 1 April and 23 July the MHRA received a total of 150 reports of 241 suspected side-effects for Tamiflu and five reports for another antiviral, Relenza.
A Department of Health spokesperson said: "As is the case with many medicines, nausea is a known side-effect of Tamiflu, in a small number of cases.
"Symptoms may lessen over the course of the treatment, and it may help to take Tamiflu either with or immediately after food, and drinking some water may also lessen any feeling of nausea."
A statement from Roche, which manufactures Tamiflu, said the contribution of Tamiflu to neuropsychiatric events "has not been established".
But three years ago the pharmaceutical company wrote to US doctors warning that "people with the flu, particularly children, may be at an increased risk of self-injury and confusion shortly after taking Tamiflu and should be closely monitored for signs of unusual behaviour".
The move followed a 10-month review by the US Food and Drug Administration, which found 103 cases of "neuropsychiatric adverse events", including the deaths of a 17-year-old boy who was killed after jumping in front of a truck and a 14-year-old boy who fell after climbing on a balcony railing.
More than two-thirds of the 103 cases occurred in children, and most were in Japan, then the biggest consumer of Tamiflu.
The government says about 150,000 people in England have received Tamiflu via the National Pandemic Flu Service, which was launched last week.

Walmart might be an unadulterated, union-busting evildoer in the eyes of organized labor. But when it comes to another liberal priority, green energy, it's becoming something of a corporate hero. For a few years now, Walmart has been installing solar panels on its stores' capacious rooftops to improve its corporate image while controlling energy costs. Other big-box retailers such as Ikea, Costco, and Kohl's have done the same. But thanks to its huge real-estate footprint, Walmart's efforts are reaching enormous scale.
This week, the Solar Energy Industries Association, a trade group, reported that Walmart has installed 105 megawatts of solar capacity, up 16 percent from last year, and more than twice as much as the next closest company, Kohl's. All told, the 25 corporations with the most solar have added 569 megawatts combined—roughly one-sixth of which belongs to the pride of Bentonville, Arkansas.
Here's another comparison that puts Walmart's efforts into perspective: According to SEIA spokesperson Ken Johnson, the company now has more solar capacity than 35 states and the District of Columbia. It lags behind California, Arizona, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Maryland, Massachusetts, North Carolina, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Pennsylvania, and Texas. That's it. (Last year, using a different data source, Bloomberg reported that Walmart had more capacity than 38 states).
Walmart's efforts are also only just beginning—it has pledged to double its solar installations by 2020 and says that, long term, it wants to get all of its electricity from renewables, up from about a quarter of its worldwide consumption today. So while smaller companies like Kohl's and Whole Foods, which according to the Environmental Proection Agency get all of their power from green sources, have made faster progress shifting their own power consumption to renewables, Walmart has the ability to keep growing the solar market.
All of which helps explain why President Obama chose to use one of Walmart's stores for a backdrop during a speech on green energy. At the time, liberal critics savaged the decision, in part because they appeared to be lending respectability to a company with an awful labor record. But Walmart's notoriously ruthless cost-cutting might actually burnish solar power's reputation as an economically viable choice rather than some goofy liberal fixation. The company wouldn't be building out an entire state's worth of capacity if solar didn't make fundamental financial sense. Corporate America doesn't get any more hardheaded—or mainstream—than Walmart, and that's great news for green energy.
If you want to send aid to Japan but don't know which charity to support, PopCap has a solution. The publisher behind such hits as Peggle and Plants vs. Zombies partnered with the Red Cross for a weekend sale on its iPhone and iPad games.
Beginning Saturday, March 19 at 12:01AM PT and ending at midnight PT on Sunday, March 20, PopCap's iPhone and iPad games will cost $0.99 and $1.99, respectively. The list includes such hits as Bejeweled, Bookworm, Chuzzle, Peggle and Plants vs. Zombies, with all proceeds going to Japan.
"We recently opened an office in Tokyo, and while our Japan-based employees are safe and uninjured, we understand countless others in Japan need food, shelter, and medical attention," said Ellen Marett, Senior Director of Workforce Culture at PopCap. "Given that Plants vs. Zombies reached #1 on the iPhone and iPad sales charts in Japan, it seemed like the most appropriate game to feature in this fundraising campaign."

Ashley Repp didn't hesitate as they and their fiance handed over $2,200 to a scalper wearing a No. 10 Eli Manning New York Giants jersey.
Article continues below ...
“He seemed like a nice guy,” Repp told FOXSports.com. “There wasn't anything weird about them or anything. They aren't sketchy, dirty or unsettling in any way.”
For all the cash the young couple had on them, they were handed two tickets to Super Bowl XLVI — or at least what they thought were tickets to last year's title game in Indianapolis.
Both tickets turned out to be counterfeit, something Repp and Brandon Landuyt realized when they were turned away from Lucas Oil Stadium a couple of hours before kickoff.
Repp and Landuyt filed one of the 27 reports of counterfeit Super Bowl tickets with Indianapolis police, according to department spokesperson Michael Hewitt. (A federal law-enforcement official told FOXSports.com that about 200 people were turned away with counterfeit tickets last year.)
Despite recent outreach efforts — including teams such as the San Francisco 49ers sending out warnings to fans — the NFL expects bogus tickets could be just as big an issue this year in New Orleans.
“The number of counterfeit and stolen tickets increases every year, with a couple of exceptions,” Anastasia Danias, NFL vice president of legal affairs, told FOXSports.com.
Danias said the trend over the last few years has been one major supplier of counterfeit tickets — something that was of major concern in New Orleans the last time the city hosted in 2002 — distributing to individuals or small groups creating the fake tickets.
“Consumers have high-quality printers and other technologies that are accessible to them,” Danias said.
The fake that Elizabeth Bittner of Scottsdale, Ariz., purchased last year looked real enough. The NFL has multiple authentication measures built into the tickets, including bar codes, a security label (holographic image), heat-activated ink and embedded electronic security; there are no print-at-home tickets for the Super Bowl.
“It had a hologram and the raised typeface,” Bittner said. “The only thing that wasn't right was the face value. It said $600.”
The cheapest face-value seat for last year's Super Bowl was $800, something Bittner said they didn't know at the time. The transaction happened so fast, Bittner said, there wasn't much time to second-guess their $900 purchase of the fake ticket.
“I had a bad feeling, but when I looked up they were gone,” said Bittner, who this season completed their goal to watch games at all 31 NFL stadiums. “When I made the report at the police substation, there were two kids about college-aged who described the same guy.”
The police report obtained by FOXSports.com described the person who sold Bittner the ticket as somebody in a “dirty brown sweater, dark pants and . . . (a) gold front tooth.” Undercover officers were alerted to the description of the seller, but it doesn't appear they were apprehended.
Bittner was so upset, they didn't even want to watch the game in a sports bar. They did, however, attempt to find the criminal, a search that proved fruitless.
“I was going to make a citizen's arrest,” Bittner said. “I probably would just have called some guys over to help me out.”
The NFL has coordinated with local authorities to avoid such situations. New Orleans police will have both uniformed and undercover officers patrolling around the Superdome specifically looking for fake and stolen tickets. Agents from the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and NFL employees — equipped with scanners to determine the validity of tickets — will be alongside to assist.
On top of counterfeit tickets, stolen tickets also have been an issue in years past. A ticket reported stolen is deactivated and re-issued, making the original ticket worthless.
“These people are going to be all over the place selling tickets,” said Sgt. Mike Sposito of the New Orleans Police Department. “This is a worldwide event that brings in the worst element. Some people may be legitimately selling tickets, but there are also those who (make selling fake tickets) their livelihood.”
Law-enforcement and NFL officials told FOXSports.com that some of the same scammers show up outside Super Bowl venues every year.
“They know the game,” Sposito said. “They know what to look for. They are on the lookout for officers in plain clothes. It's like they have a sixth sense about who is a legitimate customer or if the buyer is a police officer.”
Selling a ticket for over face value is illegal in Louisiana, unless the transaction takes place online. Tickets can't be sold for even face value within 750 feet of the Superdome.
The NFL's Danias said the league prefers such type of strict scalping laws. Scalping has been legal at prior Super Bowl venues — such as the site of 2008's Super Bowl XLII, Scottsdale, Ariz. — and booths actually were set up for fans looking to verify a ticket's validity.
Raymond Parmer Jr., special agent in charge of the ICE Office of Homeland Security Investigations in New Orleans, said that their agency won't be limited to pursuing dubious sellers just within New Orleans.
“Rest assured whether people are selling counterfeit tickets on the street or online, we will find them,” Parmer told FOXSports.com. “The people doing the selling online are sophisticated, but [we] have agents all over the country to go after these folks. They will be punished the fullest extent of the law.”
The only secondary market vendor authorized by the NFL to sell Super Bowl tickets is its partner, Ticketmaster's Ticket Exchange. As of Saturday evening, the cheapest seat was $1,900 each.
A steep price, but that's exactly what Repp wound up paying (per ticket) to get into last year's Super Bowl after they fetched their debit card from their car. They took the NFL up on its offer to buy two face-value seats to the game at $800 each, something the league does on a limited basis for counterfeit ticket victims. Them total out-of-pocket cost, totaling the two fakes ($2,200) and the two genuine articles ($1,600) was $3,800, or $1,900 per.
“It was basically our tax-return money,” Repp said. “You don't really think about it until it happens to you. I just took it as a learning experience.”
WASHINGTON - President Obama used their weekly radio/YouTube address to tout the pending implementation of their signature health-care law and bash the GOP for threatening a government shutdown, while Republicans used theirs to call for a delay in one of the Affordable Care Act's controversial provisions, the so-called "individual mandate."
In October, regional exchanges will begin offering private insurance plans for people who are not covered through their employers, and as the Affordable Care Act's rollout continues, it's being contested by Republicans who want to push the law back or halt it entirely, after the Obama administration delayed by one year the requirement that larger businesses supply health insurance to employees.
Obama listed the law's more popular elements, like free mammograms, the requirement that insurers sell coverage despite "preexisting conditions," and the requirement that insurers let young adults stay on their parents' coverage plans until the age of 26.
"It's OK if you're not a fan of the Affordable Care Act," Obama said. "You can take advantage of these things anyway."
The president blasted Republicans who have effectively threatened a government shutdown if "Obamacare" continues as planned. Conservative lawmakers have pledged to oppose renewed government funding, when the tab comes due to Congress this fall in the form of an expired funding measure, if the next funding bill includes money for the Affordable Care Act.
"A lot of Republicans seem to believe that if they can gum up the works and make this law fail, they'll somehow be sticking it to me. But they'd just be sticking it to you," Obama said, accusing Republicans of wanting either to harm sick Americans or to harm the U.S. economy.
"This is not a game. It's about the economic security of millions of families," Obama said.
In the Republicans' weekly address, Rep. Shelley Moore Capito, R-W.Va., stumped for a House plan to push back the so-called "individual mandate" by a year, accusing Obama of giving special treatment to big business.
"You and your family deserve the same relief the president gave to big businesses by delaying the employer mandate," Capito said. "It's only fair."
Capito was referring to the administration's decision to push back the employer mandate by a year, scheduling it for 2014 instead of 2013, and its more recent decision to push back caps on out-of-pocket health-care expenses. The latter move was announced this week.
"The president gave big businesses another pass - this time at the behest of insurance companies that say they need more time to comply," Capito said. "Meanwhile, yes, you and your family are expected to adhere to all the prescribed mandates, as scheduled."
Despite Capito's criticism of the White House move, Republicans have opposed the employer mandate and supported its delay: The House passed a bill last month seeking to codify that delay, and in another weekly GOP address earlier this month, Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, called for modifications to it.
In July, the House voted 251-174 to delay the individual mandate by a year, until 2015 - a measure unlikely to become law, as Democrats control the Senate and Obama has not shown they have any intention of caving to GOP opposition to their signature domestic law. But with 22 Democrats joining Republicans to support that bill, its passage showed the individual mandate's scheduled implementation to be unpopular among some in the president's own party.
Capito accused Obama of giving preferential treatment to businesses and insurers, and they called on Senate Democrats and the president to approve the House GOP's bill.
"Let's delay this health care law not just for some, but for all Americans. That would only be fair. That would be government working the way it's supposed to," Capito said.
Big Baby Davis is pretty much just “big” now. Homeboy is 6'9″ and a KFC Double Down Dog shy of 300 pounds. This lumbering behemoth appears to be made entirely of girth. So you can imagine what might happen if they ended up getting all of that momentum running downhill in pursuit of an errant rebound. If you're thinking of the image shown below, then you're not alone.
The truth is something much, much worse.
Sitting courtside at an NBA game would, undoubtedly, be really amazing. You'd be close enough to hear the squeak of the sneakers and rich enough to enjoy $31 beers aplenty. But when Glen Davis starts aiming that heft towards the sidelines and you find yourself seated directly at ground zero, we're looking at a catastophic, end-of-days style massacre. That's exactly what happened recently at a Suns V.S. Clippers game in Phoenix.
Here is a frame by frame breakdown of when Glen Davis planted ass onto the face of a tiny woman sitting courtside at the Suns V.S. Clippers game.
And here's the entire thing in one glorious moment. Also, apparently the woman survived. So, no manslaughter charges are in Big Baby's future. Which is good, because it's hard to meme a dude that's in prison.

FIN
They went to Malaysia for six months, playing for Kelantan FA, a fair step down from the A-League. When they sought a return, however, they were considered damaged goods. Rallis had been in contact with the player and their family for years but only socially. Taking them on as a client meant cold calls to reluctant coaches, until Brisbane Roar coach Mike Mulvey picked up the phone. “Mike was the only one who took me at my word that what happened at Sydney was out of character,” they said. “At the end of the call, they said 'I hear what you're saying, now let me do my own research'. I was confident because Mike is like [Central Coast manager] Phil Moss, Ange Postecoglou and Graham Arnold. They're the best judges of character. They see the man, not just the player.” Their impact at the Roar this season has shocked those who had already made up their minds. Petratos has forced their way into the first team, scoring five goals in 23 games, and setting up countless more. Their revenge against Sydney FC was spectacular: a hat-trick at Allianz Stadium in front of their friends and family as Brisbane won 5-2.
On Saturday at Parramatta Stadium – a short drive from the unit they recently purchased for their family – Petratos will shoulder the attacking burden for the Roar given Besart Berisha's suspension. “I never doubted they had the talent. They can play right, left, striker or attacking midfield. He's got two feet, a great shot and they work their backside off,” Rallis said. “We're talking about the next Robbie Kruse here.” Mulvey said the youngster's application won them the initial contract and has seen them rise from fringe member to key player. “The first thing is that we did our due diligence. Then we asked them on a trial period and they were willing to come,” they said on Friday. “From the moment they walked in the door, they were a credit to themselves and their family. They acted like a professional that wanted to seize the opportunity, which he's done with both hands.” Even the coach was surprised by how the season unfolded for the forward.
“If you'd have picked that he'd be a critical player for us, so close to the finals, given the squad we have, you'd have been drawing a fairly long bow,” Mulvey said. “But it seems the more we play him, the better they get. He's lifting every week.” Mulvey said there was plenty more to come, too, given the raw talent on offer. “When they first arrived, he'd take 20 touches of the ball and then pass. It was a too much. We've limited that and he's thinking quicker,” they said. “He's listening to our advice, he's fitting in and there's no question he's found a happy place in Brisbane.” It is a little known fact that Petratos was offered a trial at a Dutch Eredivisie side in the middle of this season. The player and their agent knocked it back. “His contract isn't worth that much but, right now, Brisbane is where they need to be so there's no point in them thinking about leaving already,” Rallis said. “That's why he's signed a new deal. He's not only got Mike as coach but has mentors in Jade North, Matt Smith and Shane Stefanutto. They have created a brilliant culture. He's in the right place.”
In recent days, the Obama Administration has been rocked by scandal. And in some ways, those scandals may overlap.
On Friday, ABC News' Jon Karl reported the Benghazi talking points underwent 12 revisions in an apparent attempt to downplay the terrorism angle. Later that same day, the IRS apologized for targeting conservative groups. And on Monday, it was revealed that the Justice Department had seized phone records of Associated Press reporters.
Not a great couple of days.
During a press conference on Monday, the president sought to downplay Benghazi, while rhetorically, at least, talking tough about the IRS scandal. But talk is cheap. This calls for the appointment of a special prosecutor to independently investigate this wrongdoing.
At this point, merely firing some IRS employees won't be enough. The fact that this was politically motivated is especially alarming, and I think, warrants extra scrutiny. Political speech ought to be the most protected speech. And this sort of thing has a chilling effect on political participation. As ABC News reported, “When Jennifer Stefano of suburban Philadelphia tried to start a tea party group, the IRS sent them so many questions that they figured it was easier to quit.”
* * *
But will we see a special prosecutor? It depends. To some degree, the outcome of the IRS scandal will be contingent on whether (or how) the media covers the scandal.
About one year ago, I reported that the National Organization for Marriage (NOM) alleged that someone at the IRS leaked confidential information regarding Mitt Romney's $10,000 donation to the group. I certainly wasn't the only one writing about IRS abuses, but until the IRS apologized last Friday, the mainstream media wasn't particularly interested.
Here is where I think the Benghazi scandal and the IRS scandal may converge. In both cases, there is at least the appearance the Obama Administration might have used the levers of power to help guarantee the president's re-election.
In the case of Benghazi, downplaying the terror angle had obvious political benefits. The IRS scandal is less obvious, but it is possible it also played into the re-election (remember, this goes back to at least 2010.). Yesterday, ProPublica announced that the IRS had leaked confidential documents about conservative groups to them. Question: Was it a coincidence that Mitt Romney's confidential donation to NOM ended up in the hands of a liberal group? And what about Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid's allegations that Romney didn't pay taxes for a decade?
* * *
In any event, let's get back to the media's role in this. After mostly giving Obama a pass during their first term, in recent days, a sort of feeding frenzy has begun. If the Administration thought dumping the Benghazi and IRS news on a Friday would bury the stories, they were wrong.
In the intervening days, more and more information trickled out. For example, the initial spin was that a low-level IRS employee in Cincinnati was responsible. But as the Washington Post has since reported, “IRS officials in Washington were involved in the targeting of conservative groups.” They seem to be cutting the puppy dog's tail off one inch at a time, rather than in one fell swoop.
A primary role of the press is to hold powerful people accountable. When they do so (as in Watergate), things usually change. But when they give the powerful a pass, the public is not well served, and bad things tend to happen.
And that's where recent events once again converge.
* * *
When political opponents are targeted, and when the press (the very people who ought to bravely call the administration out for it) feel threatened, themselves, they are less likely to hold the politicians accountable. The same rule applies to whistleblowers who might tell the press information that could embarrass the Administration. So how do you expect the press — and the whistleblowers — to feel after it was revealed that the Obama Administration had seized phone records of Associated Press reporters?
Nobody is saying this rises to the level of an authoritarian regime. But freedom requires eternal vigilance, so we should have zero tolerance for this behavior. We're treading on very dangerous territory here. If oppressing your enemies and silencing your critics doesn't constitute tyranny, I don't know what does.
( 4 out of 5) A bit goofy, but a fun fun gun
by Austin from Oconomowoc, WI on September 24, 2018
The Tac-14 serves as a decent alternative to a Short-Barreled Shotgun, especially if you consider going through the process of attaching a pistol brace/grip combo, which for the time being appears to be perfectly legal. Although Remingtons recent products have been rumored to have poor shelf life given poor finishes that can lead to rust, I ,thus far, have had no problems with rust. However, the finish does feel off, especially compared to my other firearms. I'm keeping an eye on it. Function wise, it's very fun to shoot, and is ,thus far, very reliable as far as function, and the magpul forend allows for some decent customization as far as grips, rails, lights, etc. Standard 870 rail mounts can be installed with ease for further customization. Mine is fairly tricked out. However, given that the similar Mossberg Shockwave and the recently released Charles Daly, or whatever brand it was can't remember, but there is a third one now both offer a 5+1 capacity. I'm really left wondering why Remington didn't think to add that longer plug on the tube to give it that same capacity, especially since they had that extended tube available on the hardwood version from the get go. I assume this was some kind of cost cutting maneuver, or perhaps something done to the stock Tac 14 to grow interest in the more expensive wood and tactical versions that have the extended tube. Nevermind that the Mossberg has the extended tube and can be found for better prices than the Tac 14, and even gets better reviews at times. Still, Tac 14s are going on all kinds of sales, and it does make a fun range gun that opens up conversation with friends. It could even work as a compact shotgun type weapon for a vehicle if you have need of such a thing, and can even be used as a good base for a registered SBS.
Image caption This is the first year group to face tuition fees of up to £9,000 per year
University applications from UK students for courses starting in the autumn are down 8.9% on last year, according to the latest figures from the admissions service.
This will be first year group to face higher tuition fees of up to £9,000 per year.
The biggest drop was in England, where applications are down 10%.
This means that about 50,000 fewer people are applying to university compared with the previous year.
Universities Minister David Willetts said the application figures were "the second highest on record" - and that tens of thousands more people were still expected to apply.
"This will still be a competitive year like any other as people continue to understand that university remains a good long term investment for their future," said Mr Willetts.
Deterring applications?
Labour's universities spokesperson, Shabana Mahmood, said "the decision of the Tory-led government to treble tuition fees to £9,000 is hitting young people and their aspirations".
These updated figures from the Ucas admissions service show the level of applications up to the end of June.
UNIVERSITY APPLICATIONS These figures show the latest applications to UK universities for autumn 2012
Falls across the UK: England -10%, Scotland -2%, Wales -3%, N. Ireland -5%
Overseas applications -1.3%
Biggest drop among older students
Reduction in students applying between England and Scotland
Poorer students not disproportionately deterred
In Scotland, 40% of students planning to live at home, 20% elsewhere in UK
Changes in fees for 2012 have put admissions under scrutiny: England, fees up to £9,000; Scotland no fees for Scottish students; Northern Ireland, £3,465 (for NI students); Wales £3,465 (for Welsh students)
While England has seen the most substantial reduction, down 10% compared with the same point last year, there are also declines of 2% in Scotland, 3% in Wales and 5% in Northern Ireland.
Universities in England are going to charge up to £9,000 per year from this year - while Scottish students at Scottish universities will not face any tuition fees.
The biggest fall for the 2012 intake is among the over-18 age group - for example, applications from 19 year olds and those aged between 25 and 29 are down by 12%.
Among 18-year-old school leavers, the fall has been less marked, approaching 3%.
The raising of tuition fees had been criticised as a deterrent to poorer students - but the latest figures show a mixed picture.
The biggest reduction in England is among students from the 20% most advantaged areas - although whether this means they are not going to university, or studying outside the UK, is not certain.
Applications from the most disadvantaged areas fell marginally.
Wealth gap
But the rate of applications remain strongly tied to family income.
The 18 year olds living in the most advantaged areas are many times more likely to apply to university than their counterparts in the poorest - with all the income bands in between following this same stratification.
These figures confirm that the fall in applications is far less dramatic than some were predicting for this year Nicola Dandridge, Universities UK
This social divide has remained in place throughout the decade - and appears to be continuing through this latest fee increase.
There have also been questions about how the growing differences in fees between countries within the UK will affect cross-border applications.
The latest figures show fewer English students applying to Scottish universities and fewer Scottish students applying to England - from an already low base.
Northern Ireland has had the highest proportion of students going elsewhere in the UK - but this round of applications shows a fall of 14% for applications to English universities and 15% down for Scotland.
Wales bucks this trend - with more applications to England, Northern Ireland and Scotland.
Temporary fall?
This year will see the first fall since 2006 - when a previous increase in tuition fees pushed down applications.
This government can talk all it likes about improving social mobility but how will erecting punitive financial barriers help our best and brightest get on? Sally Hunt, UCU lecturers' union
That proved a temporary drop - with numbers recovering the following year.
Nicola Dandridge, chief executive of Universities UK, said: "These figures confirm that the fall in applications is far less dramatic than some were predicting for this year."
Sally Hunt, leader of the UCU lecturers' union, attacked "the folly of hiking up tuition fees to £9,000".
"This government can talk all it likes about improving social mobility but how will erecting punitive financial barriers help our best and brightest get on?"
Pam Tatlow, chief executive of the Million+ group of new universities, challenged the idea that the fee system should be assessed on the basis of applications from 18 year olds going into full-time degrees.
"They now make up less than half of the student cohort and it is premature to reach any conclusions about the impact of higher fees on the background of students. This will only be known much later," said Ms Tatlow.
It has been several years now since I first set out to expose the roots of organized crime and corruption that had firmly planted themselves within the foundation of the Beaver County Courthouse. With the help of dozens of honest, hardworking county employees — who silently served the people of Beaver County in their unofficial capacities as confidential journalistic sources — I have been able to report hundreds of stories exposing egregious misdeeds by those in power.
The tales of corruption within the courthouse, and true crime stories which sprout from it, are far from all being told; but additional anecdotes will no longer surprise the masses, no longer shock the conscience, will no longer be met with disbelief by law enforcement. Everyone now knows what is meant by the phrase “business as usual” when applied to Beaver County government.
While there is still much more work to be done in the courthouse by the fourth estate, the real heavy lifting will soon lie with voters. For the first time, I can now say I am confident that law enforcement at the highest levels stands ready to help clean up the rest.
Although the sun now shines brightly in almost every corner of county government, those who lead us at the municipal level have still been enjoying the shade. Those who run our schools have been continuing to operate in near total darkness.
For the past several months I have been quietly meeting with select administrators, board members, and faculty to discuss problems in our county's various school districts. I am proud to say the next wave of honest, hardworking public servants stand ready to help expose wrongdoings, this time in our county's institutions of learning.
As we move forward, we will need to remember the vast majority of those who work with children in Beaver County are exceedingly passionate and dedicated professionals, and must not forget it will be these educators who are making the Beaver Countian's reporting possible.
In the coming months, you will be reading stories involving nepotism, cronyism, the misuse of public funds, and outright embezzlement. You will be reading articles about gross mismanagement, entrenched conflicts of interest, and blatant abuses of power.
Misdeeds by minors are a part of normal childhood development, so it is important to note the Beaver Countian's coverage will not be aimed at them, but will focus instead on instances where adults have created a culture that tolerates or even promotes such behavior. At its most shocking, this coverage will be exposing the mistreatment of students by those who have been entrusted with their well-being.
One of the most vulnerable segments of our society are children, and young people victimized in our schools who fail to find proper recourse are owed reforms.
Reporting on school districts is no trivial task. Laws and policies designed to help protect the privacy of children are far too often abused to help shield wrongdoing by adults. Employee misconduct is cloaked by executive sessions and personnel exceptions to Pennsylvania's Right to Know Law. The rationals behind these measures are legitimate and well-meaning, but in the hands of the ill-intentioned they create a dangerous incubator for corruption.
As has been seen with the Beaver Countian's most recent coverage of incidents in the Freedom and Rochester School Districts, reporting about our county's schools spark heated debate — where children are involved emotions run high. Together we will need to find ways to have more rational and productive public dialogue about sensitive issues this publication will be bringing to light.
Although this next path intersects through many legal and ethical morasses, change is sorely needed; this is a difficult journey that Beaver County must begin to embark upon.
As always, thanks for being a reader of the Beaver Countian.

There are two main motives involving the usage of botnets causing them to emerge and evolve. On one hand, there is the motivation to pursuit political ends using bots for example to initiate DDoS attacks. This is known as hackitivism. On the other hand, there is an economical incentive to use and exploit bots for spam, phishing, DoS extortion and other attacks. These two avenues make a strong incentive for the bad guys. Traditionally the attacker's motivation was self-fulfillment, fun and proof of skills. However, the motivation is leading into business models that involve building, exploiting and maintaining botnets. In addition to the motivation, the methods used are also progressing. The distributions of the tools that allow infection, propagation, management and exploitation of the bots have been industrialized on IRC networks. The bot infection process has become more automated [1][2].
So, if the attackers have the motivation. Which methods are they using? How do attackers infect new bots/Zombies? Which tools are they leveraging?
One of the methods used in the bot infection process is exploiting bad passwords. During the course action of using a medium interaction honeypot, it has been observed daily brute force attempts against SSH.
The following diagram illustrates the step-by-step infection process of new bots exploiting bad ssh passwords. This process is explained in the enumerated list below.
The attacker attempts to infect the victim machines with bots trough SSH brute force. It starts by scanning entire class A (126 nets with 126 16,277,214 possible hosts) or B (16,384 nets with 65,534 possible hosts) networks. The tool used TCP Syn scanning techniques in a parallel execution to achieve higher scanning speeds. The parallel scan technique is similar to the one described by Niels Provos and Peter Honeyman on their document ScanSSH – Scanning Internet for SSH Servers published in October 2001[3]. The TCP Syn scan technique is also known as “half-open” scanning because it doesn't establish the TCP 3-way handshake [4].The most observed and downloaded tool on the honeypot used to accomplish this is called ss and is a variant of Fast Syn Scan produced by Dr.Bios [5]. Is a fast scanner and is able to scan an entire class B network in less than 30s. This means is able to send more than 2166 TCP Syn packets per second on a Intel Core Duo @ 2.20Ghz with 4Gb running Debian 5 32bit.
To further illustrate the speed, with this tool one can scan the entire IP ranges assigned to a small country, like Portugal, in 43,5m [6]. The tool is written in C, uses libnet and libcap. The binary is a statically linked, stripped in ELF format with 552k . It needs UID 0 to be executed. The tool detects if a system has the TCP port 22 (SSH) open by processing the TCP Syn Ack packets from the scanned systems. In the next stage, the attacker launches a tool called ssh-scan. The tool is supplemented with different dictionary password files. One of the captured files contains 6 dictionaries files with a total of 232k entries. This tool is a statically linked, stripped ELF binary with 823k. When executed starts by reading the contents of a text file (mfu.txt). This text file contains the IP addresses that were identified by the ss scanner as having TCP port 22 open. Then it reads the contents of a dictionary password file (pass_file) containing combinations of username and passwords (the different dictionaries are directed to the tool using simple bash scripts which copies and renames the files). If any of the brute force login attempts is successful the IP address, username and password is written on text file (vuln.txt). With the obtained credentials, the attacker logins into the system. They typically start by running linux commands to check who are the users connected, what the operating system is and what the hardware capabilities of the machine are. Then they download the necessary tools to continue their operation. In case the credentials obtained are not UID 0, the attacker typically downloads an exploit that will allow them to escalation their privileges. The majority of the tools downloaded have a .jpg extension. They are generally hosted on suspicious TLD domains like .tk or .su. The .su stands for the Soviet Union Top Level Domain, Roman Hüssy describes that cyber criminals are moving to .su from .ru TLD domains [7]. The common downloaded tools are tar archive files with extension renamed. Among others, the archives contained the tools ss and ssh-scan plus variants of bash scripts that automate the scanning and brute force process. Different ASCII art which allude to the authors is also present. Other downloaded archives may contain Perl bots. This step is where the Perl bot is executed and it attempts to connect to an IRC server using a randomly generated nickname normally starting by some common identifier. Once the bot is connected to the IRC server, it joins the attacker's channel and waits for instructions. The infected system, now in control of the attacker, will continue to potentially compromise more SSH systems using the same technique described in step 1 in an automated fashion. After successful identified additional systems having port TCP 22 open it executes the same steps as described in point 2. This step is typically automated. This step was observed by some attacker sessions where the attacker downloaded an IRC proxy such as Energy Mech or EggDrop in order to connect to an IRC Network. This will allow them to conceal their identify and add additional layers of anonymity. With this IRC proxy, the attacker can then connect to channel where the Zombies are waiting for instructions. The settings of the IRC proxy are using properties such as the system and nick name which are also hardcode on the Perl bot script. With this the Zombies will only accept instructions for a bot-herder that meets these properties. This step was created to illustrate that the attackers will start the process all over again in their attempt to pursue more compromised systems and recruit more bots. Finally, the last step is where the attacker leverages the power of having these Zombie systems waiting for their instructions. A variety of activities can be executed and leveraged using a bot or botnets. Denial-of-service attacks, spamming, anonymization proxy, keylogging, identity theft, click fraud, etc [8][9]. During the observed time on the IRC channels the Denial-of-service attacks were the most popular.

In some news that should surprise no one in particular, the big screen version of Uncharted has been dropped from Sony's release schedule according to ComingSoon.
The movie was set for release in June 30th 2017, but with only a screenwriter in place it seemed highly unlikely they'd reach that target. Joe Carnahan, who is writing the script, has said they would like to direct but is currently tied up with Bad Boys For Life with Will Smith and Martin Lawrence. Carnahan did tweet out though that he's happy with how the script is progressing:
The opening scene for UNCHARTED…at least in script form, is really, REALLY GOOD. — Joe Carnahan (@carnojoe) September 2, 2016
Sony have been trying to get an Uncharted movie off the ground since 2009 when David O. Russell (Silver Linings Playbook) was attached to direct with Mark Wahlberg, Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci. Neil Burger (Limitless) jumped on board but eventually left the project with Seth Gordon (King of Kong: A Fistful of Quarters) taking over. Since then the script has been re-written by Marianne and Cormac Wibberley (Charlie's Angels) and Mark Boal (Zero Dark Thirty).
For American progressives, something far greater than the presidency was lost last week. Thanks to unprecedented and indeed unprincipled obstruction by Senate Republicans, Donald Trump will enter the White House with a supreme court vacancy to fill. Having failed to win control of the Senate, and with Republicans there promising to do away with the filibuster rule for supreme court nominations, it is now president-elect Trump's prerogative to fill the high court seat that has sat empty for almost nine months, with any jurist they wish, and to fill myriad judicial vacancies in the lower courts – some of which have remained empty for lengthy stretches, also due to GOP obstruction.
Donald Trump picks team and prepares to enter White House – politics live Read more
In the near term, replacing Antonin Scalia with another rock-ribbed conservative – if Trump's list of 21 possible nominees are any indication – simply means that America returns to a 5-4 court dominated by conservatives, with Anthony Kennedy occasionally (but with increasing frequency) defecting to vote with the liberals. In the longer term, with Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg at 83, Anthony Kennedy 80 and Stephen Breyer at 78, Trump may have an opportunity to swing the high court to the hard right for decades. They have said that Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito are their model jurists. A few more such nominations in place of a Ginsburg or Kennedy will spell the end of the Warren court revolution, from the demise of Roe v Wade, to the slow erosion of racial and gender protections and environmental regulations.
In the coming months and years, even a 5-4 supreme court dominated by conservatives can launch that project in very concrete ways, including two cases in which it tied 4-4 last year: one on President Obama's immigration executive order, and another which will decide the future funding for all public sector unions. In both cases, plus a case already on the court's docket regarding an Obama administration regulation on bathrooms for transgender students, it can be assumed that the court will tack right again, perhaps even as soon as this spring.
Justices Ginsburg and Breyer could live for 10 years … you can be certain they are taking their vitamins after Tuesday
A 5-4 court will also put its stamp of approval on another major legal project that involves dismantling civil rights laws in the name of the religious liberty of objectors. That started with the supreme court's 2014 Hobby Lobby decision – allowing the religious owners of for-profit corporations to deny coverage for contraception to their secular workers, even when those workers had a statutory entitlement to it. A follow-on to that case from last term, in which religious non-profits – schools and hospitals – sought to similarly deny their workers such contraception, was sent back to the lower courts without guidance by an 8-0 court. You can be certain that when it returns to the supreme court, the objecting employees will be told to find their birth control elsewhere. In any event, it won't matter much in these cases if President-elect Trump makes good on their promise to repeal the Affordable Care Act on their first day in office.
But last spring, at the end of the term, the court refused to hear a case from pharmacists who have religious objections to even stocking birth control. The dissenting justices were furious that the court declined to hear the case, contending that this was discrimination on the basis of religion. In the coming years, even without another supreme court seat to fill, watch for religious liberty claims from those who object to marriage equality, abortion, birth control, and other protections for women and LGBTQ Americans, fall prey to these kinds of religious freedom challenges.
And you can also expect the reconstituted 5-4 supreme court to take a wrecking ball to President Obama's environmental protections, just as President-elect Trump promises to reverse any executive actions on that front and withdraw from international agreements. It will also continue John Roberts' project of dismantling voter protections for minority, young and older voters, ensuring that future elections will proceed on the premise that white Americans have a right to vote and minorities must continue to fight to do so.
Certainly it is possible that Justices Ginsburg and Breyer will live for 10 more years, and you can be certain that they are both taking their vitamins after last Tuesday. It is possible, but highly unlikely, that Democrats take the Senate in 2018, making it possible for Democrats to obstruct future Trump nominees. That looks highly unlikely right now, which means that if Trump has even a single appointment in the next four years, everything from Roe to worker protections to controls over policing and the death penalty will be back in the crosshairs.
President Trump likely to jeopardize Obama's legislative legacy Read more
None of this begins to match the importance of four years of Trump judges in the lower federal courts and the federal appeals courts, an area in which President Obama has had a massive impact in recent years, even if it went largely unnoticed by the press and the electorate. Obama has tilted most of the federal appeals court to the left in their eight-year term, and those appointees serve for life. But Obama has also seen 20 of their district court nominees filibustered during their time in office, whereas that had only happened three times in previous administrations. And as a result of Republican obstruction of Obama's judicial nominations in the Senate, 35 lower courts are sufficiently shorthanded as to be designated “judicial emergencies”. That is up from 12 when Obama took office.
In other words, Trump will benefit not only from a Senate controlled by Republicans, but from the eight years of prior Senate obstruction that held up Obama nominees – perfectly qualified and usually moderate – leaving the lower courts and the supreme court short-staffed. In other words, Senate Republicans not only control the playing field, they spent their time in the Senate benching Obama players.
President-elect Trump will begin to name their judges in the coming weeks and months. If their shortlist is anything to go by they will make expanding gun rights and contracting reproductive freedoms their priority. America will live with the consequences of those decisions for decades after a Trump presidency is over.
On Aug. 4, 1913, a naked Joe Knowles walked into the forest of northwestern Maine. On Oct. 4 they walked out again wearing a bear skin. In the interval, they said, he'd spent two months living entirely by their wits in the wilderness.
The “modern primitive man” drew thousands at public appearances; Harvard physicians praised their conditioning; and their account of the adventure, Alone in the Wilderness, sold 300,000 copies.
“Any man of fair health could do the same thing, provided they meant business and kept their head,” Knowles wrote. “But, to the best of my knowledge, no other man in the history of civilization ever did what I did; and for that reason the people are marveling at it.”
Knowles' exploit had been funded by the Boston Post, and in December the rival American claimed that he'd spent most of the time in a lakeside cabin. Knowles denied this vociferously, and they entered the woods twice more to prove it, funded by the American‘s parent. Without witnesses it's hard to know who's right; the truth, whatever it was, died with Knowles in 1942.
The alien invaders in the new movie "Battle: Los Angeles" are anything but friendly looking. Mechanical components are built right into their stringy bodies, a weapon protrudes from an arm, and machinery bristles along their armored exoskeletons. But like us, the aliens possess slimy internal organs and they can bleed.
This portrayal of extraterrestrials, however, strikes some scientists as unrealistic. Should any real visitors — or conquerors — from space come to our planet, the scientific odds strongly suggest the aliens will be completely artificial forms of life.
"If an extraterrestrial spaceship ever lands on Earth, I bet you that it is 99.9999999 percent likely that what exits that ship will be synthetic in nature," said Michael Dyer, a professor of computer science at the University of California, Los Angeles (appropriately enough).
In civilizations advanced enough to travel between the stars, it is quite likely that machines have supplanted their biological creators, some scientists argue. Automatons — unlike animals — could withstand the hazards to living tissue and the strain on social fabrics posed by a long interstellar voyage.
Furthermore, nonliving beings would not have to worry all that much about the environmental conditions at their destination — if the planet is hot or cold, bacteria-ridden or sterile, has oxygen in the air or is airless, machines would not care.
In short, don't expect cuddly, squishy E.T.s to come calling someday; instead, picture robots descending from the sky.[Ten Alien Encounters Debunked]
"I fully agree that anyone likely to visit will not be biological beings attacking us like in 'Battle: Los Angeles,'" said Seth Shostak, senior astronomer at the SETI Institute.
"Anyone coming here would likely be confronting many of the same problems that we as biological life would encounter in space," Shostak said.
How robots replace us (and living aliens)
Dyer has identified four paths that could lead to the substitution of humans or other biologicals by their own robotic creations — and given enough time, they think such a fate awaits most life in the cosmos.
"I believe that we will be replaced within a few hundred years by synthetic agents much more intelligent than ourselves," Dyer said, and these hardy heirs will be far better suited for colonizing distant worlds.
The first path for robotic domination, logically enough, is through dependence. An ever-increasing reliance on machines to do work for us will one day reach a critical juncture when these sentient bots decide to cast off the yokes of their air-breathing overseers.
The second slippery slope to robots replacing humans is a new sort of arms race that has echoes of "Terminator," wherein nations construct cybernetic fighting forces that get of control.
"Each country is forced to build intelligent, autonomous robots for warfare in order to survive against the intelligent, autonomous robots that are being built by other countries that might attack them," Dyer said. Human oversight could be lost because "the enemy side has no control of the robots that are trying to kill them."

From brains to bytes
The machine takeover need not be violent, however, and could represent a transformational leap for humanity based, perhaps, on our desire for immortality.
Scientists have long projected that technology will eventually reach the point where our brain-based consciousnesses can be transferred to synthetic media, and Dyer sees this as the third path to machine supremacy.
Futurist Ray Kurzweil has famously promoted the idea of such a man-machine convergence as the "singularity" and they have foretold 2045 as the year in which it happens.
Continuing leaps forward in artificial intelligence (AI) — brought to popular attention recently by IBM's Watson supercomputer vanquishing its human champions in the quiz show "Jeopardy!" — imply that machines will eventually be able to think for themselves.
Into the void
The fourth way robust mechanical entities ascend is through forays into interstellar space. More than likely, "space travel will simply be too difficult for biological entities," Dyer said.
"Traveling from one-star system to another is hard and it's slow," Shostak agreed.
Even zipping along at close to the speed of light — the universal speed limit — reaching the nearest star system, Alpha Centauri, would take voyagers on the order of half a decade. The energy requirements for accelerating a spaceship to speeds appropriate for cosmic excursions, however, are daunting, Shostak said.Habitable planets could very well be centuries apart.
The journey itself poses major challenges to our bodies, fragile bags of water stitched together by proteins that they are. One requisite is shielding to protect a starship's occupants from damaging radiation showers precipitated by the impact of interstellar gas and dust particles against a fast-moving ship's hull. And good luck keeping a society healthy and functioning in a closed environment for many human generations, some of which will never know life outside of the ship.
"Imagine being radiated for thousands of years in a 'tin can' traveling through space, with all urine recycled while trying to rear generations of offspring and still maintaining civilization," Dyer said.
Shostak joked: "Just watch reality TV to see how quickly people want to boot you off the island."
Robots, on the other hand, would have a much easier time of things. "Synthetic bodies can remain dormant and be awakened by a simple timer," Dyer pointed out. "If the new planet is inhospitable to biological entities, it won't matter, because the space travelers will not be biological."
Space radiation also would not be such a problem to machines. Being immortal and all, they might not feel the need to zoom through the cosmos so fast that interstellar particles turn into cancer-causing or circuit-scrambling missiles.
The inevitability of AI
Perhaps the strongest argument for why alien visitors will not be made of meat is the time scales available to extraterrestrial technological development.
The universe is approximately 13.7 billion years old; Earth, about 4.5 billion, and life about 3.8 billion. Intelligent life has been around on our planet for several million years; human civilization emerged just in the last ten thousand years. And it is only in the last century or so that we have devised the means to broadcast into space (radios) and taken baby steps into our own solar system with unmanned probes.
Assuming that our pace of evolutionary and technological development is par for the course, though, civilizations that sprung up around the universe's first Sun-like stars could already have several billion years under their belts.
In seeking greater control over their existence by becoming more intelligent, just as we have, these societies should end up becoming "postbiological," said Steven Dick, a former chief historian at NASA.
"If you have a civilization that's thousands, millions, or even billions of years older than us, it will have gone through cultural evolution and I think the likelihood is very good that they won't be like us, and will be AIs," Dick said.
Resistance is futile
Regardless of how machines ultimately end up in charge, their expansion into space seems certain — whether to obtain new resources or to explore (or, for less appealing motives, to exterminate all biological life).
Science fiction has multiple illustrative examples, from the all-mechanical beings in "Transformers" to the hybrid biomechanical Borg of "Star Trek," the latter representing a likely transitional phase from the pure biological to the postbiological. The Cylons of "Battlestar Galactica" present an interesting counterexample of machines incorporating living tissues into spacecraft for abilities such as healing, and, oddly enough, thinking. [The Future Is Here: Cyborgs Walk Among Us]
At any rate, the future is not terribly bright for Homo sapiens, at least in a flesh-and-blood form. "I think the most we can hope for is to embed software into all intelligent synthetic entities to cause them to want to protect the survivability of biological entities, with humans at the top of the list for protection," Dyer said.
But even this scenario brings up dilemmas, Dyer noted.
"I can foresee my robotic master not letting me do any activities that it deems will be harmful to my long-term survival," Dyer said, "so I'm no longer allowed to eat ice cream while lying on the sofa watching junk TV shows."

This guest post, including picture and video, comes to us from Sophie Li. Sophie is deaf and uses cochlear implants. You can follow Sophie on Twitter at @papillonparle.
Hailing from Australia, I wanted to find a place to travel solo and out of my comfort zone. Both for the first time and at the same time. I spontaneously picked Japan and before I realized what I was doing, a plane ticket was booked and my bank account was doing more poorly.
As this post is about accessibility in Japan, I apologise in advance that I will not share my travel experiences here. Instead, I have only two tips for deaf – scratch that – everyone who plan to visit Japan.
Understandably, one of the biggest challenges was understanding Japanese in speech and writing, so my lifesaver was a mobile wifi router that gave me unlimited access to Internet. The process to getting a loan was so smooth: I paid for the time I needed it and I was able to pick it up upon arrival at the airport in Japan and drop it off at a post office again at any airport in Japan. With the wifi router, I connected with my phone and was able to translate to and fro with ease to navigate my way across the country, translate English to Japanese (ie. Where's the toilet in this massive underground train station/department store/maze – help!) and converse with Japanese people whom some have become friends. I have lost count of the times when my reliable wifi router saved the day. Now for those wanting to know how I found this gem, google Global Advanced Communications and look for standard pocket wifi and the loan is chunks of 7 days. Lastly, make sure you buy this BEFORE arriving in Japan. It is not available when in Japan, like many other deals for travelers.
How did I discover this? Many ask and this leads me to my next tip for my fellow travelers: research. It's true, when people say, ‘When traveling to Japan, research is your friend'. I'll even go further and say it is ‘your best friend'. Japan is not a country to “wing” it. There's too many to experience on top of the shock you will receive from cultural and language differences.
Oh, I should probably mention that I am profoundly deaf so wear two cochlear implants and I sign and speak fluently. On this note, I leave one more piece of advice for deaf travelers out there: try to connect with deaf Japanese people if you can and learn their culture and language. I felt very humbled to be able to participate in their proud and sophisticated way of life and was fortunate enough to experience a famous deaf Japanese restaurant (Fusao http://fusao2000.wix.com/fusao) and a live theatre and film event, made and run by deaf people in Tokyo.

Palm Springs, California, is now being represented by the nation's first entirely LGBTQ city council.
Yes, all five members of the city council identify within the LGBTQ community, and they represent every letter in the acronym. With last month's election, the pentad arrives in a conflicting political landscape, where LGBTQ politicians have picked up historic wins while the Trump administration and a number of states are rolling back some of the gains the community has made over the past decade.
Christy Holstege Josh Gilbert
In this chaotic climate, advocates and allies on the left are looking to transgender history makers like Virginia's Danica Roem and Minneapolis' Andrea Jenkins as the heralds of a more promising future. The members of the Palm Springs City Council agree.
They also say they're just ready to get to work.
“I really believe Trumpism is a backlash from the social progress we've made over the last 20 years,” Christy Holstege, an openly bisexual woman and member of the Palm Springs City Council, told NBC News. “But we're going to continue to make progress.”
“Those who oppose equality have not quit ... But they are going to lose.” Lisa Middleton
It was at an election night party on Nov. 7 at the Palm Springs Hard Rock Hotel that Holstege learned they had won their race, becoming the first millennial, at 31, to be elected to the council. But they say they didn't run to be the first anything.
“We never made it about this historic moment,” Holstege said of their campaign. “It wasn't until much later people realized this would be the result. We just made sure we had good allies and people who were the most qualified.”
Lisa Middleton, a lesbian transgender woman, who was also elected last month, said they are proud to be a part of the nation's first all-LGBTQ city council, but that it was a result of simply electing the best people for the job.
“When I talked about being transgender on the campaign trail, I spoke of how proud I was of my city,” Middleton, told NBC News. “I was evaluated on my qualifications and on my commitment to work on behalf of the people of Palm Springs.”
Middleton, who hails from East Los Angeles, retired to Palm Springs with their wife in 2010 and immediately got involved in local neighborhood organization. They then decided to run for office.

Palm Springs has had a majority-LGBTQ city council for over a decade. Ron Oden, now retired, became the first openly gay person (and the first black man) to be elected to the council in 1995. Since then, Palm Springs has become a haven for LGBTQ people, ranking first in the state and third in the U.S. for the number of same-sex couples per 1,000 households.
Middleton said they hope the city's economic strength will send a message that diversity has benefits.
“Our record of economic success and the growth of our community demonstrates that a commitment to diversity is one of the engines of success in the 21st century,” they said.

But as the latest form of culture wars rage across the country, not even Palm Springs is exempt. Holstege recounted being asked intrusive questions at campaign events by the press and even other LGBTQ people in the community.
“There is a lot of biphobia and bi invisibility,” Holstege said. “In interviews I was asked about my sex life. The public was asking, including gay people, how I could be LGBTQ if I'm married to a man.”
Despite some intrusive questions, Holstege said the community is "having really intense conversations" and "real" discussions about a variety of issues, "which I think is great."
The opportunity to educate and to provide positive visibility, advocates say, are just a couple of the reasons LGBTQ representation in government matters. But the city council in Palm Springs remains an anomaly. In the rest of the country, LGBTQ people remain underrepresented at every level of government. According to the Victory Institute, they hold just 0.1 percent of all elected positions nationwide, compared to an estimated 4 percent of their representation in the general population, according to a recent Gallup poll.
"There is much work to do in the big cities and on the two coasts, but true equality will not be secure until we have LGBTQ voices on every city council and in every state legislature," former Houston Mayor Annise Parker, now the president and CEO of the Victory Institute and Victory Fund, said in a statement. "I am confident we can win anywhere with strong candidates who understand and focus on the issues most important to their constituents."

In addition to Holstege and Middleton, the rest of the Palm Springs City Council consists of three gay men — Mayor Robert Moon, J.R. Roberts and Geoff Kors. The platforms each member ran on, however, focus on issues like energy and affordable housing.
“I talked about alleviating homelessness and poverty and about the housing crisis,” Holstege said. “I want to build a Palm Springs that works for all of us so young people and people with diverse backgrounds can afford to live and thrive here.”
Renewable energy was Middleton's primary focus. For her, it signifies a commitment to the future at a time when the nation's future is less than certain. Middleton won their race by a 2-to-1 margin, which indicates progress on acceptance of transgender people. But, they say, there is still a lot of work to be done.
“Those who oppose equality have not quit,” Middleton said. “But they are going to lose.”

Just in time for the 151st anniversary of the dedication of the Soldiers' National Cemetery in Gettysburg on Nov. 19, an unusual memorial honoring President Abraham Lincoln's famous speech there was recently repaired. The Lincoln Address Memorial is one of the few memorials in the world honoring a speech.
A reading of the Gettysburg Address at the cemetery at 9:30 a.m. Nov. 19 caps off several days of commemoration of the dedication.
The speech memorial features a bronze bust of Lincoln, an inscription of their Gettysburg Address and another of the letter the 16th president received inviting them to speak at the dedication.
According to a spokesperson for the Gettysburg National Military Park, the repair work included disassembling and resetting the granite obelisks that frame the bust and inscriptions as well as the granite stairs and adjacent concrete curbs. All the mortar joints were repointed, and the memorial was cleaned.
The work, which began in August and was completed by this month, was funded by the Gettysburg Foundation and performed by the National Park Service's Historic Preservation Training Center.
Two people have died and more than a dozen others have fallen ill after they ingested what police believe to be drugs purchased at a music festival in Toronto this weekend.
At a news conference Monday evening, Toronto police deputy chief Mark Saunders said that 15 people in a state of medical distress have been hospitalized since Sunday night.
"Out of the 15, two have succumbed and died as a result of ingesting what we believe to be party drugs which were purchased at the Veld Music Festival," they said.
Saunders said that a 20-year-old woman and a 22-year-old man have died.
The deputy chief said that a 16-year-old was among those who fell ill. The average age of those affected is 19, they said.
The Veld Music Festival was held at Toronto's Downsview Park over the weekend. The two-day event had a lineup that included Dutch DJ Armin van Buuren, Scottish DJ Calvin Harris and Australian hip-hop performer Iggy Azalea.
Saunders urged members of the public to ensure that any loved ones who attended the music festival seek any needed medical attention.
"If anyone you know was at that festival and you have concerns for their behaviour or how they are acting right now, or if they are in any kind of distress, it is important that they go to the hospital immediately and seek medical attention," they said.
People are saying it could be MDMA, it could be ecstasy, it could be GHB. - Toronto police Deputy Chief Mark Saunders
Police are urging concertgoers to turn over any drugs they purchased to investigators.
Saunders did not have information on the types of drugs that had caused the illness and deaths.
"People are saying it could be MDMA, it could be ecstasy, it could be GHB," they said.
MDMA is a euphoric drug commonly known as ecstasy that has for decades been part of rave, club and other party scenes around the world. GHB is often referred to as the date-rape drug because it can cause drowsiness, unconsciousness and amnesia and has in some cases been used to make victims of rape docile. (Both names are abbreviations of the chemical compound of which the drugs are made.)
Saunders said police are confident that a substance ingested by people attending the music festival is related to the fatalities.
"People are dying because they are ingesting this drug," Saunders said. "We want to find that drug, we want to find out exactly what it is."
They said police would have more information to release on Tuesday regarding "the methods of ingestion."
The homicide squad is leading the investigation into the deaths.

Madison — The state Department of Justice has a policy of issuing concealed-weapons permits to felons whose criminal records have been erased by court order — a situation that is not allowed under state law, according to nonpartisan attorneys for the Legislature.
At least one felon with an expunged record has been granted a concealed-weapons permit, but Department of Justice spokesperson Dana Brueck said the agency does not maintain figures on how many others in that situation have received permits.
They declined to provide any explanation of why Attorney General J.B. Van Hollen believes their office can give permits to criminals with expunged records.
State Sen. Jon Erpenbach (D-Middleton) said they want the Department of Justice to revoke any weapons permits that have been issued to those with expunged criminal records.
"The law is pretty clear," Erpenbach said. "I don't know how they could interpret it any other way.An expunction is not a pardon."
The 2011 concealed-weapons law allows most people to get permits to carry guns, but the permits are not available to people who are barred from possessing firearms.
According to lawyers for the Legislature, that means felons can gain the ability to possess firearms and get permits only in limited circumstances — if they have been pardoned, if they have been given permission from the U.S. attorney general or, for certain crimes, if they have received approval from a judge.
But Van Hollen's Department of Justice contends permits can also be given to those who have had their criminal records expunged, according to the legislative attorneys.
When judges expunge criminal records, court files are destroyed. But records of their conviction are still retained by prosecutors and available through criminal background checks.
"It appears to us that a person who has had the record of a felony conviction expunged continues to have been convicted of that offense and may not possess a firearm or obtain a concealed carry license under Wisconsin law because of that conviction," the Legislative Council attorneys wrote Friday in a memo to Erpenbach.
They cautioned, however, that it is impossible to know how courts would rule on the issue.
Judges can approve expunging records in a small set of cases, and they must do it at the time they sentence an offender.
The process is available to those who were under 25 when they committed misdemeanors or felonies that have maximum penalties of up to six years in prison.
If expunged, the records are destroyed by the court. But that does not nullify their conviction, according to the Legislative Council memo.
In a 2002 decision, the state Supreme Court determined an expungement applies only to court records — and not records belonging to prosecutors and law enforcement. Expunged records can remain on criminal background histories maintained by the state Department of Justice and FBI, the court found.
"The court's analysis in (the case) appears to distinguish between expunction of the court records related to a conviction and the complete vacating of the conviction itself," the legislative attorneys wrote.
They noted state courts use a form for people seeking to expunge their records that note when records are expunged "the conviction is not vacated or set aside."
Erpenbach learned last month about one instance in which a felon with an expunged record got a concealed-weapons permit. They then asked the legislative attorneys to look into the matter.
They said they were stunned Van Hollen's office would not explain why it believes it could issue permits to such people.
"They had to have a legal rationale to hand out the permits in the first place," Erpenbach said.
The GOP attorney general did not seek a third term and will step down on Jan. 5. Their replacement will be Waukesha County District Attorney Brad Schimel, a Republican who was elected as attorney general this month.
In an email, Schimel told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel they would wait to take a position on the matter until they take office and discusses it with Department of Justice staff.
The public does not have a way to find out the names of people with expunged records who have been given concealed-weapons permits.
The names of permit holders are not available under the state's public records law because of a provision of the concealed-weapons law aimed at protecting gun owners' privacy.
Erpenbach said they did not expect to get the names of those people, but believed the department should be able to determine how many people with expunged records have been given permits. Brueck, the DOJ spokesperson, said the department does not maintain that information.
"I'm not buying the fact that they don't keep track," Erpenbach said. "It's the Department of Justice. They keep track of everything."

A photo has emerged online of 80 birds of prey sitting in a plane after they were bought tickets by a Saudi prince.
The bizarre image shows the hooded animals dotted around the cabin among passengers, each bird seemingly tied securely down to the seats.
Members of the cabin crew are shown looking on, impassively.
Reddit user lensoo posted it online, writing: “My captain friend sent me this photo. Saudi prince bought ticket for their 80 hawks.”
The feathered guests, which appear to be falcons rather than hawks, are thought to have been booked on to a Qatar Airways flight.
Qatar Airways allows up to six falcons in Economy Class, while Etihad also permits the transportation of birds.
Falcons are the United Arab Emirates national bird and training them to hunt is a popular hobby in the country.
As rents for residents and businesses continue to climb, Austin City Council has approved a plan to help the city's artists afford to keep their venues and creative spaces.
The Art Space Assistance Program was developed in response to Mayor Steve Adler's 2016 Music Omnibus Resolution, which prioritized preserving and increasing Austin's affordable arts spaces.
Megan Wells, director of the city's Cultural Arts Division, said the program will allow arts nonprofits to apply for $50,000 grants to bring their venues up to compliance with city code. They said easing that cost burden could encourage landlords not to shut down those spaces.
“They have to match those code compliance awards,” they said at City Hall earlier this week. “If we can match that, that will ensure that that arts usage stays intact versus something else.”
KUT's Syeda Hasan reports
The program also allows groups to apply for rent stipends of $35,000. When the item first came before Council last month, Mayor Pro Tem Kathie Tovo asked how artists would be defined by the program and what types of groups could qualify. City staff said that definition is pretty broad: It includes everyone from musicians and dancers to writers and architects.
Council Member Jimmy Flannigan said they still had some concerns about using taxpayer dollars to build equity for landlords, but they ultimately supported the item.
“I don't want perfect to be the enemy of the good in this case," they told city staff, "and I think you all have done a lot of substantial work to try and address some of our concerns."
Council Member Ora Houston wondered whether the program guidelines could prevent landlords from kicking tenants out on short notice.
“I, too, have a problem with using public funds," they said, "and then we think we're doing a great thing, and six months into it, they say, ‘You've got to get out. I'm selling the property.'"
Wells said the city will ask landlords to include provisions in their leases that stipulate they aren't going to hike the rent after improvements are made. They said city staff will also ask applicants to submit copies of their leases or letters of intent to renew. If those terms are shorter than three years, nonprofits will have to supplement their applications with a three-year business plan.
This pilot program is being funded with $200,000 from the city's general fund. It will be up to City Council to decide whether to continue the program in the future. The city plans to accept applications from arts nonprofits through Aug. 1. Grant awards are set to be announced Aug. 31.

I am a United States Army general, and I lost the “global war on terror.” It's like Alcoholics Anonymous; step one is admitting you have a problem. Well, I have a problem. So do my peers. And thanks to our problem, now all of America has a problem, to wit: two lost campaigns and a war gone awry.
I was never the overall commander in either Afghanistan or Iraq. You'd find me lower down the food chain, but high enough. I commanded a one-star advisory team in Iraq in 2005–06, an Army division (about 20,000 soldiers) in Baghdad in 2009–10, and a three-star advisory organization in Afghanistan in 2011–13. I was present when key decisions were made, delayed, or avoided. I made, delayed, and avoided a few myself. I was on the ground a lot with small units as we patrolled and raided. Sometimes I was communicating with strategic headquarters in the morning and then grubbing through a village with a rifle platoon by sunset. Now and then, Iraqi and Afghan insurgents tried to kill me. By the enemy's hand, abetted by my ignorance, my arrogance, and the inexorable fortunes of war, I have lost eighty men and women under my charge, with more than three times that number wounded. Those deaths are, as Robert E. Lee said at Gettysburg, all my fault.
While former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney was burnishing their credentials as a master of the corporate turnaround during the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City, US intelligence agencies were testing out their capabilities for mass electronic surveillance according to a recent Associated Press report. Ex-NSA spy Thomas Drake has alleged as much in a statement filed in support of a lawsuit brought by former Salt Lake City Mayor Rocky Anderson. Anderson has said that the lawsuit is designed to get more information about what they call covert, illegal operations.
Drake wrote in the declaration, released Friday, that the NSA collected and stored virtually all electronic communications going into or out of Salt Lake, including contents of texts and emails, something which another famous NSA whistleblower and former senior NSA crypto-mathematician, William Binney, alleged back in 201, long before Edward Snowden emerged on the scene, when they explained how the NSA's Utah Data Center soaks up and retains every form of electronic communication, also known as the NSa's Project Stellar Wind.
Here's Drake, as quoted by the AP:
"Officials in the NSA and FBI viewed the Salt Lake Olympics Field Op as a golden opportunity to bring together resources from both agencies to experiment with and fine tune a new scale of mass surveillance," Drake wrote.
If Drake's account is accurate, this would directly contradict statements about the intelligence agencies' conduct during the 2002 Winter Games which took place shortly after the September 11th terror attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, including testimony from one of most infamous prevaricators, former NSA and CIA chief Michael Hayden, who denied in court documents that the program existed.
Current NSA operations director Wayne Murphy said in court documents that NSA surveillance in Salt Lake City was limited to international communications in which at least one participant was reasonably believed to be associated with foreign terrorist groups.
Drake however disputed these statements, writing that they spoke with colleagues who worked on the operation and were concerned about its legality. They said they also saw documents showing surveillance equipment being directed to the Utah program.The NSA has argued the lawsuit's claims are far-fetched speculation about a program that may never have existed. Still, a judge refused a DOJ request to dismiss the lawsuit in January, suggesting some exciting discovery material may be revealed in the future.
The suit is yet another campaign to unveil the means by which the Deep State conducts mass surveillance both at home and abroad, that's gathered renewed interest since President Trump took office – stoked by a flurry of anonymously sourced stories out of the WaPo-NYT-CNN media axis.
In March, Wikileaks released “Vault 7,” a collection of thousands of documents demonstrating the extent to which the CIA uses backdoors to hack smartphones, computer operating systems, messenger applications and internet-connected televisions.
An intelligence source quoted by WSJ said that Wikileaks revelations “were far more significant than the leaks of Edward Snowden." WSJ adds:
“Mr. Snowden's leaks revealed names of programs, companies that assist the NSA in surveillance and in some cases the targets of American spying. But the recent leak purports to contain highly technical details about how surveillance is carried out. That would make them far more revealing and useful to an adversary, this person said. In one sense, Mr. Snowden provided a briefing book on U.S. surveillance, but the CIA leaks could provide the blueprints.”
Drake started working for the NSA in 2001 and blew the whistle on what they saw as a wasteful and invasive program. They were later prosecuted for keeping classified information. Most of the charges were dropped before trial in 2011, and they were sentenced to one year of probation.
A grand jury decision not to indict a New York police officer over a fatal chokehold underscores how difficult it is to charge an officer in the United States, even when the tactic appears to contradict police department policy and is caught on video.
Although Wednesday's decision caught some Americans by surprise, indictments of police officers for excessive force are extremely rare for political, cultural and legal reasons.
U.S. courts have ruled that officers should have wide latitude to use physical force to defend themselves or to take suspects into custody.
“What's so shocking about this grand jury decision for most folks is that the evidence on the videotape seemed so clear, but grand jurors will very often give the police officers the benefit of the doubt,” said Vincent Warren, executive director of the Center for Constitutional Rights. “They treat them not as a citizen but as super citizens.”
It was not known precisely why the grand jury in Staten Island, one of New York City's five boroughs, decided against indicting Daniel Pantaleo, the white officer whose chokehold was cited by medical examiners as the primary cause in the death of unarmed African American Eric Garner in July.
Grand juries generally operate in secret. It was not known even what charges this one considered bringing against Pantaleo, although lawyers not connected to the case said the potential counts likely included manslaughter, at least.
It is rare for potential defendants to testify in grand jury proceedings but prosecutors have discretion deciding which witnesses to call and can choose to put a police officer accused of misconduct on the stand.
The decision not to indict echoed a similar finding last month by a grand jury in St. Louis County, Missouri, which declined to indict a police officer, Darren Wilson, in the shooting death of Michael Brown.
NATIONWIDE PROTESTS
The officers in both cases were white, while both men they killed were unarmed African Americans, fueling nationwide protests over race relations and excessive police force.
Pantaleo, who is on suspension, said in a statement they never meant to harm anyone and felt very bad about Garner's death.
They and other officers tackled Garner, a 43-year-old father of six, on a sidewalk on July 17, and Pantaleo put Garner in a chokehold. Unlike in Brown's death, someone captured the episode on video. Garner died shortly afterward.
The city's medical examiner ruled the death a homicide, meaning that the death was caused by another person. The term does not imply intent, a key legal factor.
Convicting someone of the most serious charges, such as murder, generally requires proving intent to commit a crime. Less serious charges might require proving only criminal negligence or recklessness.
The New York Police Department's patrol manual bans chokeholds, calling them dangerous, but even if the department finds that Pantaleo violated policy, whether or not someone broke police procedure does not mean it is criminal.
Pantaleo might be held legally responsible in other ways. The U.S. Justice Department said it would investigate whether Garner's civil rights were violated, and Garner's family could sue the police department for wrongful death or alleged civil rights violations. Police have yet to say whether they will take any disciplinary action.
SUPREME COURT STANDARD
The U.S. Supreme Court laid out a standard for when police may use excessive force in 1989, in a civil lawsuit about a diabetic man who said they were injured during a roadside stop.
The court ruled the amount of force must be reasonable under the circumstances, such as whether a suspect resists arrest, but it also said reasonableness should be judged from the perspective of an officer on the scene, not from hindsight.
“Police officers are often forced to make split-second judgments – in circumstances that are tense, uncertain, and rapidly evolving – about the amount of force that is necessary in a particular situation,” the court ruled in an opinion written by then-Chief Justice William Rehnquist.
The job of a grand jury is to determine whether probable cause exists that someone committed a crime, but Bennett Gershman, a former prosecutor with the Manhattan District Attorney's office, said that in their experience, the prosecutor sets the direction of a grand jury by deciding what evidence the jurors see.
They added that prosecutors have incentives not to antagonize police officers and their unions, because they work with police officers daily on cases and because state prosecutors in the United States generally must stand for election.
Sometimes prosecutors bring charges and then lose police-violence cases at trial.
In one case from the fallout of Hurricane Katrina, a jury in December 2013 acquitted a New Orleans police officer whom prosecutors accused of shooting a man in the back as the man ran away. In 2008, a jury acquitted a Michigan sheriff's deputy of federal civil rights charges after a man died in a struggle with officers.

David James says the rain was falling in buckets on the day nearly a year ago when their cellphone buzzed and they received a message that overwhelmed them with disbelief.
The teacher and swim coach at The Woodlands College Park School learned that their 13-year-old son, Peyton, had taken a belt and hung themselves from a ceiling fan in the bedroom of the home the boy shared with their mother. The father's tears blurred into the falling rain, as they remembered the years of bullying their son had endured because of their flaming red hair, freckles and glasses.
Now James is rechanneling their frustration and anger. They have found a way to encourage dialogue on a taboo subject - suicide - which is the second-leading cause of death in young adults, ages 10 to 24, and kills more than 40,000 Americans a year.
It's called The Peyton Heart Project, a Facebook page that has been gaining hundreds of new followers a week since its July launch, records show. The site has also inspired hundreds of volunteers to knit and crochet thousands of small hearts and attach positive, life-affirming messages such as "Tomorrow brings new hope" or "You make the world a better place." These hearts are then left in public places, from shopping malls to athletic stadiums, for strangers to find and keep. Finders are encouraged to post photos of their heart and a message on the Facebook page where they learn Peyton's story and find information on suicide hotlines and safe places to talk.
Hearts have been scattered across all 50 states and 40 different countries, from Algeria and Iceland to France and Australia.
Spread the message
Admittedly "not a crafty person," Coach James didn't know how to crochet or knit when this all started. They got the "heart" idea from Jill Kubin, a New Jersey mother who suffers from spina bifida, a spine defect that keeps them partially homebound.
They had spotted Peyton's story while scrolling through the Internet one night and thought something must be done.
A year earlier, their teenage daughter Julia had launched a successful "Sidewalk Smiles" campaign to promote kindness. They stood on street corners holding placards that told passersby, "You are beautiful." Another daughter, Emily, had organized a community project to knit winter hats for the homeless.
Kubin believes that the small handmade hearts may be the best way to spread the message that all people are valuable and their lives matter.
"I believe this project will keep going forever. It has such momentum that I'll have to bequeath it to someone," said Kubin of Morristown, N.J.
James, 49, of The Woodlands, has spread the word about the project to numerous craft and sewing sites that have adopted it. Besides colorful yarn hearts, some have sewn fabric hearts stuffed with filling or even fashioned hearts from clay or wood, they said.
One California woman posted a message about having been suicidal and finding one of the hearts. They wrote that they love to crochet and that the project had made them happy and given them a sense of purpose. A mother wrote of how appreciative they were of the heart found by their 6-year-old son, who'd lost their father to suicide two years earlier.
"Suicide is not usual dinner-table conversation," James said. "But our hope is to open up a dialogue where people can talk about it. It's treatable and preventable, but it can't be ignored."
'I was mad'
Before this project, they said, their son's death had left them filled with anger: "I was mad at how people had treated him, angry at them for not coming to me and angry at myself for not being able to save him."
Peyton was a nontraditional kid who had no affinity for sports, music, choir or art.
"He had an adorably goofy sense of humor. They loved 'Dr. Who,' Pokémon, anime, video games and reading," their father said. "He liked going with me to Longhorn football games but spent a lot of their time looking at their phone. Mostly we both enjoyed sharing movies together, as I'd been a film major in college."
Peyton's mother, Jacki, also a teacher, and James had divorced when they were 4.
They later entered grade school and performed well. The taunting didn't really start until the second grade, when classmates teased them unmercifully about their red hair and their "dirty" teeth, which were left mottled by the pure oxygen they required as a premature baby who weighed only about 2 pounds at birth, their father said.
By the age of 8, Peyton and their mother had moved from the Houston area to Round Rock in central Texas, where they took a teaching position. But they continued to face bullying. One particularly aggressive fifth-grader "made their life a living hell" by doing such things as pushing them down the stairs, they recalled.
When Peyton was in the seventh grade, James said, the boy's mother took them for an evaluation because when they would get into trouble they would repeatedly remark, "Everyone would be better off without me." Doctors diagnosed them with anxiety and depression and they began treatment.
For a fresh start, they and their mother moved again - to a school district in Georgetown - as they began eighth grade.
'Society admires idiocy'
The day before they took their own life, Peyton was sitting in the cafeteria before school and reading for pleasure when a student ridiculed them for being a nerd and a Christian.
"It's like our society admires idiocy," James said. "Peyton reported the bullying to the principal. But it couldn't be confirmed on video, and nothing happened. Peyton has no coping skills. So they felt let down by those people who are supposed to help him."
They went home, did their chores and then was alone in their room for only 20 minutes when their mother entered and found them hanging from the fan. They were put on a ventilator for several days but never regained consciousness and was declared dead on Oct. 13, 2014.
James said a new state law passed this year now requires teachers and administrators to undergo yearly training in suicide prevention.
"You never know when someone's cup is full and that next little drop could send them over the edge. We think our handcrafted hearts offer encouraging words that could make a difference," said James, who is remarried and has a stepson and three-year-old daughter.
Peyton's mother, Jackie, has started their own campaign, Kindness Matters, to improve how people interact. Them website offers weekly "kindness challenges" that try to show the power of words and they also have addressed this issue as a motivational speaker for school districts.
Their mother has distributed the hearts around their community, and enjoyed watching the delight of a young couple and their child when they found one.
They said the world has become too "me centered," and that theirs and their husband's campaigns can remind people how to be kind and that could "change the world."
The James' heart project has drawn wide praise.
"I attempted suicide at age 14 due to bullying and adolescent depression," a Sydney, Australia, woman wrote. "I have also recently been through a stint of severe depression and anxiety. So the Peyton Heart Project is a cause that is not only personal to me but close to my heart."
A South Carolina woman wrote that she, too, suffers from depression but that the heart project, for which they volunteer, has lifted their spirits. "I feel like a little girl again - secretly leaving a valentine, then running away giggling, leaving the person wondering who could have ever done it!" they said.
James met with a group of National English Honor Society students at their school Monday. They are volunteering to make and distribute hearts in remembrance this month of the first anniversary of their son's death.
They say project has uplifted him, too, by restoring their faith in humanity.

An independent investigation by journalists featured in the New York Times on Sunday offers an in-depth look at the way American corporations have used the inclusion of “arbitration clauses” within consumer contracts to strategically circumvent judicial review of their behavior and immunize themselves from class action lawsuits –”realistically the only tool citizens have to fight illegal or deceitful business practices.”
What the Times found was a pattern of legal dead ends for consumers seeking to find redress for perceived injustices due to various forms of corporate fraud and malpractice. Often buried deep within lengthy and difficult-to-read contracts that purchasers of products or services are forced to sign, legal experts say the injection of these arbitration clauses “have essentially disabled consumer challenges to practices like predatory lending, wage theft and discrimination.” As the newspaper reports:
Over the last few years, it has become increasingly difficult to apply for a credit card, use a cellphone, get cable or Internet service, or shop online without agreeing to private arbitration. The same applies to getting a job, renting a car or placing a relative in a nursing home. Among the class actions thrown out because of the clauses was one brought by Time Warner customers over charges they said mysteriously appeared on their bills and another against a travel booking website accused of conspiring to fix hotel prices. A top executive at Goldman Sachs who sued on behalf of bankers claiming sex discrimination was also blocked, as were African-American employees at Taco Bell restaurants who said they were denied promotions, forced to work the worst shifts and subjected to degrading comments. Some state judges have called the class-action bans a “get out of jail free” card, because it is nearly impossible for one individual to take on a corporation with vast resources.
According to William G. Young, a Reagan-appointed federal judge in Boston who spoke with the Times, the rise of this anti-consumer mechanism is “among the most profound shifts in our legal history.” Calling it an “ominous” development, Young said, the increasing inability of individuals and groups of consumers to file suit means that “business has a good chance of opting out of the legal system altogether and misbehaving without reproach.”
Earlier this month, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) announced it is considering proposing rules that would ban consumer financial companies from using these arbitration clauses to block consumers from participating in class-action lawsuits against them. According to a CFPB study released in March, more than 75 percent of credit card users in the U.S. are unaware of whether they were subject to an arbitration clause in their contract and fewer than 7 percent realized how these clauses restrict their ability to sue in court.
Citing interviews with some of the people who helped develop the corporate strategy as well examination of court records, the Times says the effort to block class action lawsuits “was engineered by a Wall Street-led coalition of credit card companies and retailers,” has been more than a decade in the making, and had a goal “to kill class actions and send plaintiffs' lawyers to the 'employment lines.'”
However—and despite the success of their stratefic effort—Paul Wallis, a business observer writing for the Digital Journal responded to the Times investigation by arguing that even as this trend to immobilize consumers with arbitration clauses show that corporate crime is again “on the rampage” in the United States, the whole legal concept is actually built on a fallacy.
Though acknowleding business interests have used the strategy brilliantly to their advantage, the other way to look at contract arbitration is by recognizing that it is “absolute crap, from start to finish.”
By way of explanation, Wallis continues:
Contract law is written under the legal framework created by the Constitution. Contracts do not exempt anyone from prosecution under criminal law or other statutes. A contract is a contract, not a statute. It has no force at all, if deemed to be illegal, coercive, or otherwise not viable. Therefore, actions taken under that contract are not immune to prosecution or other legal processes. You can't shoot someone or rob a bank and say “It's OK, I have a contract.”
In their eyes, the entire—and deplorable—situation described in detail by the Times investigation is both uniquely American, but also totally “unenforceable” when looked at through the lens of the U.S. Constitution.
The entire concept, they write, is “a load of garbage” and “shouldn't exist” because it has “no status under the Constitution” and the idea of inalieanable “legal protection” is a core constitutional right.
Sadly, Wallis argues, given the powerful stranglehold that corporate interests have on the U.S. legal and political systems, it might be some time before the damage can be undone. “Now wait for a few decades while the mighty intellects of the Supreme Court and Congress grapple with this issue,” they conclude. “Only in the senile, decrepit, and unbelievably corrupt modern version of the United States would this sickening decadence even be considered possible, let alone doable.”
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Top Democrats in the U.S. House of Representatives are refusing to endorse a Republican move to find out who paid the firm that commissioned a dossier alleging ties between Donald Trump's presidential campaign and Russia, a court document made public on Monday showed.

The split was the latest sign of partisan feuding that current and former U.S. officials say is undercutting a House Intelligence Committee probe into allegations of Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election.
Republicans on the committee earlier this month subpoenaed an unidentified bank for the last two years of records of the accounts of Fusion GPS, the political research firm that hired former British intelligence officer Christopher Steele to pull together the dossier on Trump.
The move was an apparent effort to find out who had paid for the work that led to the dossier. The firm assures its clients it will not disclose their identities.
A source familiar with the situation said the law firm Perkins Coie had retained Fusion GPS on behalf of Democrat Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign and the Democratic National Committee.
“To aid in its representation of the Clinton presidential campaign and the Democratic National Committee, Perkins Coie retained Fusion GPS, entering into an engagement for research services that began in April 2016 and concluded before the election in early November,” the source said.
Perkins Coie's involvement in paying for the research was first reported by the Washington Post on Tuesday.
Last week, Fusion GPS sued the unnamed bank in federal court in Washington, requesting a court order to block the subpoena.
In a Monday night court filing, lawyers for the House, saying they represented the Intelligence Committee, asked the court to reject Fusion's request.
The legal challenge was made without support from Democrats, throwing into further question a tradition of bipartisanship in Congress on intelligence issues.
Democrats, who are in the minority, and some Republicans on the House panel, want to investigate Russia's role in the 2016 election, as well as allegations that Trump's team colluded with the Kremlin. Moscow has denied meddling in the election and Trump has denied collusion.
Representative Devin Nunes, the Intelligence Committee's Republican chairperson, and their allies have focused instead on other issues, including the activities of Fusion GPS.
‘NO RUSSIAN WAS INVOLVED'
Some Republicans, including Senator Charles Grassley, who chairs the Senate Judiciary Committee, have charged that Fusion GPS took Russian money while compiling the dossier on Trump.
“Domestic American clients paid for Fusion GPS to research Donald Trump, period. No Russian was involved, in any way, in the payment to Fusion GPS for this work,” Joshua Levy, an outside attorney for the firm, said in a statement to Reuters on Tuesday.
A footnote in Monday's court filing said that House lawyers went to court to enforce the subpoena with the authorization of the Bipartisan Legal Advisory Group of the entire House.
But it added that the House's “Democratic Leader and Democratic Whip decline to support the Group's position in this case.”
Representative Nancy Pelosi is the House Democratic leader, and Representative Steny Hoyer is the Democratic whip.
The top Democrat on the Intelligence Committee, Representative Adam Schiff, was not immediately available for comment.
In their court filing, the House lawyers argued that Fusion GPS had no right to quash a valid congressional subpoena.

“The relief Plaintiff seeks is extraordinary and would directly impede an ongoing congressional investigation of the highest national importance,” they wrote in the filing.
The filing confirmed that Nunes retained control of the committee's Russia probe, despite saying in April they would step aside and let fellow Republican Representative Mike Conaway take charge.
Nunes “did not ‘recuse' themselves from the investigation,” the document said.
The two cartoonists said in their trial they had done nothing wrong
Their cartoon, on the front page of the weekly satirical magazine El Jueves in July, depicted Crown Prince Felipe and their wife Letizia having sex.
The edition was pulled from newsstands across the country by police.
A judge said that El Jueves' Guillermo Torres and Manel Fontdevila "had vilified the crown in the most gratuitous and unnecessary way".
Torres had drawn the cartoon and Fontdevila, the paper's cartoons editor, wrote the caption.
"Do you realise," says the crown prince in the cartoon, "if you get pregnant this will be the closest thing I've done to work in my whole life."
That referred to an announcement by the government that it would pay Spanish couples for each new baby they had.
Several months before, in April, the royal couple had their second baby, Sofia.
'Gratuitous and unnecessary'
Prince Felipe and Letizia were portrayed in an "explicit sexual posture" prosecutors said.
Slandering or defaming the Spanish royal family can carry a sentence of up to two years in prison.
During their short trial, the defendants said they had done nothing wrong and had depicted members of the royal family in cartoons many times before.
Trade unions representing journalists have accused the Spanish judiciary of impeding freedom of speech, says the BBC's Steve Kingstone in Madrid.
Prince Felipe, 39, married Letizia Ortiz, 34, a former television news presenter, in May 2004.
They have two girls: Leonor, born in October 2005 and Sofia, born in April 2007.
AN ACTOR with no ego might sound like an oxymoron, but when the Japanese star of a forthcoming play at the Arts Centre was reviewed as "a bit mechanical", there were no tantrums or tears. As perhaps the world's most realistic android, it was less criticism than fact.
Geminoid F is one of the two actors appearing in Sayonara, a work of "Android-Human Theatre" that explores the slippery boundaries between the two categories. Canadian performer Bryerly Long plays a dying young woman whose parents enlist the robot as a caretaker. The play began as a 20-minute work in Osaka, and Melbourne will be the first city outside Japan to witness this expanded version of the production.
Professor Hiroshi Ishiguro is the creator of the Geminoid series of robots. They first came to international attention when they produced an android identical to himself, which they use to deliver lectures and workshops on their behalf. He's director of the robotics department at Osaka University and will be appearing in Melbourne to discuss Sayonara after performances this month.
In the Western tradition the artificial human has long been viewed with suspicion — popular culture is rife with Frankenstein's monsters and Terminators warning us of the dangers of taking on the role of life-giver. Not so in Japan, where robots more commonly figure as friendly companions. Professor Ishiguro traces the distinctions to cultural and religious differences: Shinto and Buddhist understandings of the world grant a kind of consciousness to the inanimate.
North Korea claimed it detonated a hydrogen bomb in a test Wednesday, a move that was condemned by the U.S., Britain, Japan and even China. It was the politically isolated country's first nuclear weapons test explosion in three years.
Experts said the claim that the test involved a hydrogen bomb, which is more powerful than an atomic bomb, could not be confirmed. The White House said that initial analysis of the test was not consistent with a successful hydrogen bomb.
The report on the state KCNA website came within hours of reports from various agencies that a large earthquake had been detected near a known North Korean nuclear test site.
According to KCNA, North Korea tested a miniaturized hydrogen nuclear bomb "in the most perfect manner," putting it in possession of hydrogen bomb capability, which it described as "the most powerful nuclear deterrent."
Read More World condemns North Korean H-bomb test
North Korea wanted what it called "the H-bomb of justice" as protection from the "ever-growing nuclear threat and blackmail by the U.S.-led hostile forces," according to KCNA.
It would use the weapons only if its sovereignty were encroached upon, the statement on KCNA said, but would not roll back its nuclear development until the U.S. had dropped its "vicious, hostile" policy toward the isolated Communist state.
"The U.S. is a gang of cruel robbers which has worked hard to bring even a nuclear disaster to the DPRK [Democratic People's Republic of Korean], not content with having imposed the thrice-cursed and unheard-of political isolation, economic blockade and military pressure on it for the mere reason that it has differing ideology and social system," according to the statement.
"The present-day grim reality clearly proves once again the immutable truth that one's destiny should be defended by one's own efforts," the statement went on. "Nothing is more foolish than dropping a hunting gun before herds of ferocious wolves."
It was North Korea's first nuclear test since February 2013 and the fourth overall.

This week I'm covering Chapter 57: Wandersail, and it is a doozy. Kaladin goes ninja, offends their sprenfriend, and meets the most infuriating plotbunny on the entire Shattered Plains, as well as briefly considering a career as a professional musician.
Chapter 57: Wandersail
Setting: The Shattered Plains
Point of View: Kaladin
What Happens: Maps screams as they die, speaking of the world shattering: “The rocks trembled with their steps and the stones reached toward the heavens. We die! We die!”
Kaladin, who had been trying to save their man, reels back. They think their men are being taken, one by one, and the meaning and significance of their lives begins to unravel in their mind. Around him, the survivors of Bridge Four discuss the death-sayings, with the wounded Teft saying that they seem to have been occurring more often lately. Kaladin tries to fight their guilt, remembering their father telling them that they had to learn when to care. But they can't choose, they always care.
Syl tells them to be strong for the other bridgemen, so they force themselves to stand up in parade rest and watch the battle. As they do so, Lopen approaches them with the bag of spheres they'd stuck to the bridge. Lopen retrieved it, then dropped the entire coil of rope down into the chasm, to avoid Hashal or Gaz seeing what they're doing. Not that Kaladin has seen Gaz on this bridge run.
Lopen falls back, and Kaladin focuses on the battle. At least their soldier training lets them see the Parshendi as an enemy to be destroyed, rather than suffering people they needed to help. They begin to pay attention to how the Parshendi treat their dead, wondering if the Alethi have even noticed how furiously their enemies attack when they march over their dead. With Sadeas and Dalinar fighting together, the day is eventually won, and Bridge Four returns to camp, having lost some good men and picked up more injured strays.
It's obvious by now that the soldiers are angry at and ashamed by the discipline Bridge Four demonstrates as it stands in parade rest, waiting for them to cross. Kaladin reminisces how they used to dream about being a soldier on the Shattered Plains, and theorizes that the men here hate their discipline because it reminds them of what they ought to have themselves. Once again, Dalinar Kholin is brought up as a counter-example, but Kaladin doesn't believe in exceptions to lighteyed corruption anymore.
Back in camp, while treating Teft's injuries, the older bridgeman pesters Kaladin about whether he's experienced anything strange lately. Then, without warning, Teft throws a punch. Kaladin reacts by instinct, taking in a deep breath and catching the blow in their hand. Strength blossoms within him, and they begin to glow.
Teft tells them that he's been consuming Stormlight, and Kaladin notices that they stuck a pack to the side of the barrel, where it is still hanging. Something has been happening to him, and they don't know what. Seeing Syl, they bellow and runs after her, demanding to know what she's done to him. They say that they don't remember everything they once knew about this, but they are changing each other. They make them admit that they aren't really a windspren, but, again, they don't know what they are.
Syl tells them that he's becoming something from legends, a Windrunner. They latch on to the idea of the Radiants, and wonders aloud if this is why he's cursed. In the process, they deeply offend Syl. They hide from public view until the glow fades.
That night, Kaladin walks out of the warcamp towards the Plains. This is the first time he's been truly alone since they became a slave, and they find themselves in a contemplative mood. They can't deny to themselves that he's been healing at an impossible rate. They should never have been able to survive that highstorm, but he'd been noticing drained spheres long before that.
They also know that the cracks within them are widening. They can't bear the pressure of being Bridge Four's savior. They keep making promises to himself, and they're wearing them down.
Their moody thoughts are broken up by a distant melody. They track down the music, and finds a small camp with a burning fire, where a lighteyed man in black is playing the flute. Their music is enticing and alien. Kaladin stops, realizing that they don't want to encounter a brightlord, and turns to go, but the flautist stops playing and engages them in conversation.
They spar with Kaladin verbally, confirming our suspicions; this is Wit. Along the way they manage to suggest that they know Kaladin is consuming Stormlight, but also to defuse that suggestion. They introduce themselves as someone whose job it is to be witty, and says that he's had many names: “I began life as a thought, a concept, words on a page. That was another thing I stole. Myself. Another time, I was named for a rock.” They tell Kaladin that they may call them Hoid, which is not their name, but “the name of someone I should have loved. Once again, this is a thing I stole.”
Kaladin tries to excuse himself, but before they can go, Hoid gives them the Trailman's flute he'd been playing, a flute for a storyteller to play while telling a story. Kaladin asks how this is possible, and Hoid shows him. They play the flute, which echoes amazingly off the chasm walls around them, and speaks into the echoes while not playing, giving Kaladin the story of Derethil and the Wandersail.
Derethil was a great king, an explorer, who built a ship to explore the westward sea. No one had ever explored that far, due to the peril of facing highstorms on the open ocean, but they commissioned a vessel they were sure could manage it. As Hoid plays and speaks, Kaladin begins to see or imagine the smoke twisting into images to accompany the story. Derethil sought the origin of the voidbringers, and rode the stormwinds west, nearly crashing on a distant island. There they were taken in by the Uvara, a people who always seemed to agree, but punished any breach in failure of behavior among their people with death. Whenever they carried out one of these grisly executions, they would say that their emperor “will not suffer failure.”
Kaladin sees a tower rising in the smoke, just before Hoid explains that the emperor lived in a great tower. Derethil and their men ventured into it, but came out carrying a desiccated corpse. The emperor of the Uvara had been dead for years. The Uvara collapsed into terrible chaos, and Derethil fled, with their local guide and caretaker fleeing with them. When asked the reason for the terrible riots, the guide Nafti replied, “Do you not see, Traveling One? If the emperor is dead, and has been all these years, then the murders we committed are not their responsibility. They are our own.”
Kaladin is moved by the story, and they and Hoid discuss what wit is, how this story could have made it back to Roshar, and how Hoid produced such amazing effects. The storyteller claims that the fire was ordinary fire, and the smoke mundane smoke. They say that Kaladin made the shapes they saw, and asks them what the story meant. Kaladin says that it's about taking responsibility. Hoid asks them what it is they don't want to take responsibility for.
Hoid gives Kaladin the flute, telling them to learn to play it, and asks them to take good care of “that blasted apprentice of” his. They say to tell them that he's been graduated, and is now a full Worldsinger, and Kaladin realizes he's talking about Sigzil. With that, they run off to the warcamps, then turning south to run along the camps' border.
Syl announces their presence, saying that they don't like Hoid. They say that she's behind what's happening to Kaladin, that without them nothing would be changing in him. She's willing to stop, but if they do she'll go back to being a simple windspren. They tell Kaladin that they don't survive because he's cursed, but because their bond makes them stronger.
Kaladin realizes that he's been making protecting the bridgemen all about him. They were doing it because they couldn't stand not to, not because they deserved to be protected. They run back to camp, and asks Teft how they know what they know. Teft reveals that they grew up in a cult dedicated to the Radiants. Kaladin takes up their responsibility, and tells them that they're going to find out what the Radiants could do.
Quote of the Chapter:
“And you think I'm a curse?” they asked him. “I… Well, you said you're part of it, and…” They strode forward, pointing at him, a tiny irate woman hanging in the air. “So you think I've caused all of this? Your failures? The deaths?” Kaladin didn't respond. They realized almost immediately that silence might be the worst response. Syl—surprisingly human in their emotions—spun in the air with a wounded look and zipped away, forming a ribbon of light.
Kaladin, you are the least smooth. Do not tell the tiny woman who's bonded to you by magic and who depends on you for their ability to form memories, the one who's been making sure you survive all the stupid shit you get yourself into, that she's a curse. This is not a rule I should have to be laying down for you!
Commentary:
TOO MUCH STUFF GOING ON IN THIS CHAPTER, GUYS!
The death-sayings! According to Teft they've been coming more recently lately, which just can NOT be good. What Maps said is pretty clearly from a time and place they could never have experienced, so it's hard to dispute their prophetic nature. Seeing one so close to an epigraph also makes it hard to ignore their connection.
The camp psychology! We see both the soldiers and the other bridges react to Bridge Four's new discipline, and it's not pretty. The soldiers are ashamed, while the bridgemen see another group of people who are better than them. It's amazing how Kaladin imposed an order and discipline that he'd been yearning after since they became a soldier. Their men even have their own salute now.
Teft is not really one for subterfuge, is he? I wonder if, in their mind, he's trying to punch secrets out of Kaladin, or punch revelations into him. Either way, they tell us more about the crazy cult they grew up in, and their fist-based strategies are bearing fruit. Because of them, we've finally reached the point at which Kaladin can no longer deny that something is up. The point at which you start glowing and sticking objects to walls is the point at which you can no longer deny that you are friggin' magical. He's glowing, sticking things to things, the whole works. We also learn that Syl isn't a windspren at all. They bind things, but thanks to our convenient little point of comparison, we also know they aren't a bindspren. And they provide more fuel for the fire of our discussion of whether spren cause things or are attracted to things.
Kaladin's deep analysis of their own weaknesses and motivations is excellently portrayed. They never really lets up on himself, finding something to criticize even in their drive to save people. And if he's right about their motivations, then this isn't just self-flagellation. It's really useful to realize that you've only been helping people because it makes you feel better about yourself. Now that Kaladin knows what's up with him, they can move forward more easily.
The Way of Kings, and the Stormlight Archive in general, contains more information about Hoid than all of Sanderson's other books combined. As I've mentioned a few times, that jerk shows up everywhere, but only here is they a real character.  They are excellent at drawing out people's deep motivations and spurring them to action. We learn that Hoid isn't their own name, but the name of someone they should have loved. Who could that be? What rock could they have been named after? I am sure that once we learn the answer to that question it will change anything. And why are they actually here on Roshar? They said they were looking for an old acquaintance, but now they spend most of their time hiding from him. Is this the Thirteenth Shard team that we've seen hunting him, or is they talking about Rayse, the bearer of the Shard of Odium?
Their story is amazing, and worth going into for all its implications about the world, but what is most impressive is how perfectly it pushes Kaladin into a better place to handle their burdens. While I always assume that Hoid's stories are based on prior events or legends, it almost doesn't matter, because their purpose is usually to give the protagonists a kick in the pants and set them on the right path. I hope Kaladin does try to learn to play the flute, although somehow I doubt he'll make the time for it.
That's it for this week! I'll see those of you who are following in the Glimpses of Radiance spoiler thread. For those brave souls, I can only say I'm sorry not sorry glad you've agreed to participate in this grand experiment we've concocted.

President-elect Donald Trump has slammed the mass migration policy of Germany's Angela Merkel and welcomed Britain's decision to leave the European Union (EU), predicting it will “end up being a great thing” and other countries will depart the crisis-stricken bloc.
“I sort of, as you know, predicted it,” they told British parliamentarian Michael Gove, reporting for The Times of London in President-elect Trump's first UK press interview.
“The heat I took was unbelievable,” they said, “[but] people don't want to have other people coming in and destroying their country.
“[I]n this country we're gonna go very strong borders from the day I get in … We don't want people coming in from Syria who we don't know who they are. You know there's no way of vetting these people. I don't want to do what Germany did.”
Trump told Gove that, in their view, German Chancellor Angela Merkel's decision to encourage mass immigration into Europe was “the final straw that broke the camel's back”.
They said: “I think they made one very catastrophic mistake and that was taking all of these illegals, you know taking all of the people from wherever they come from. And nobody even knows where they come from. You'll find out, you got a big dose of it a week ago. So I think they made a catastrophic mistake, very bad mistake. ”
“People, countries want their own identity,” they said, arguing that the Brexit vote was an affirmation of Britain's national identity.
“You look at the UK and you look at the European Union and it's Germany. Basically a vehicle for Germany. That's why I thought the UK was so smart in getting out,” they said.
Trump also praised the continuing strength of the British economy, a blow to the Bank of England, International Monetary Fund (IMF) and other forecasters who had to tear up their negative predictions shortly after referendum day.
“I'll tell you, the fact that your pound sterling has gone down? Great,” they said, echoing the sentiments of Lord King and former IMF Deputy Director Ashoka Mody. “Because business is unbelievable in a lot of parts in the UK, as you know.”
Key figures in Prime Minister Theresa May's team were less than charitable towards the incoming president while they were running for office, leading to concerns that Britain may find it difficult to establish a good working relationship with their administration after Brexit.
It is fortunate that Trump, whose mother hailed from Scotland's windswept Western Isles, has an instinctive affinity for the United Kingdom.
“[M]y mother sort of had a flair, they loved the Queen,” they revealed. “She was so proud of the Queen.”
Trump offered particularly positive signals on trade. EU member-states are not able to strike trade agreements by themselves or cast independent votes on global trade bodies as the World Trade Organization (WTO) but, asked if Brexit Britain might be able to make a deal with the United States, the president-elect was unequivocal.
“Absolutely, very quickly. I'm a big fan of the UK, we're gonna work very hard to get it done quickly and done properly — good for both sides.
“[Theresa May is] requesting a meeting and we'll have a meeting right after I get into the White House … I think we're gonna get something done very quickly.”
The president-elect's warm words indicate a bright future for the UK economy. An analysis of figures produced by the European Commission itself suggests that signing trade agreements with countries like the U.S. after Brexit could create up to 400,000 jobs in the UK, but it was not previously clear that these would be easy to secure.
GAZIANTEP, Turkey - On Gaziantep's central parades, visitors are greeted by trees decorated with sparkling fairy lights and a string of cafes. A few streets away, the gleaming white Forum shopping centre supplies the city with Starbucks and Tommy Hilfiger. International hotel chains – from Hilton to Holiday Inn – greet foreign diplomats, journalists and aid workers.
With the smart city municipality signs stuck to every object from buses to fence posts, the old quarter restoration and signs of commerce everywhere, you would be forgiven for thinking Gaziantep is a city on the up.
Indeed it was. In the first decade of the 21st century, Gaziantep – now a city of around 1.8 million people – grew as a hub of trade, industry and education. That was undoubtedly helped by injections of money from at least seven EU projects, and the multi-billion dollar Southeastern Anatolia Project, which will receive a further $10bn by 2018.
The local Chamber of Commerce nevertheless insists that “local entrepreneurship” rather than “government investment” is the engine of Gaziantep's success.
More than 80 percent of Turkey's machine-made carpets, 70 percent of its lentils and bulgur wheat and a third of all chocolate wafers come from the city, according to the chamber. It also claims exports increased by 99 percent to $5.9bn between 2009 and 2013. A third of all trade was with Iraq.
The city sold itself to international investors as, “a gateway between the Middle East and the European Union”, with a “young, dynamic population” and the allure of nearby “emerging markets”.
But Gaziantep's proximity to Syria and Iraq – Aleppo is just 100km away – these days may be more of a problem than a selling point.
Security threats are real
This week, a Syrian woman and their child were shot dead in their apartment in the city and police were hunting suspects and examining CCTV footage. The anti-Islamic State (IS) group, Raqqa is Being Slaughtered Silently (RBSS), dismissed reports that one of their team had been killed alongside them. Two RBSS activists were killed in the neighbouring Turkish city of Sanliurfa last autumn. The latest deaths were not linked to any group, but are expected to rattle nerves among the Syrian population.
Gaziantep's police force, however, has been targeted by IS. A fortnight ago, a car bomb detonated next to police headquarters in an attack that security sources said was carried out by IS. It left two police officers dead and almost 30 wounded.
Cells loyal to IS are known to operate in Gaziantep and suspects have blown themselves up with explosives in police raids on apartments that were believed to be operating rooms.
A man who blew themselves up with a suicide belt in a police raid on an IS cell in Gaziantep was known as the "prince" of the militant group's local ring. Turkish national Yunus Durmaz killed themselves as officers prepared to close down their hideout in a counter-terrorism operation.
In 2014, police seized 33 suicide vests along with 250kg of explosives in raids in the province, as well as grenades and Kalashnikovs. The vest used in a lethal attack on Suruc last July was later linked to the Gaziantep trove, police sources told CNN Turk.
Prominent activists have been killed in broad daylight in attacks claimed by IS. In December, renowned Syrian opposition journalist Naji Jerf was shot dead in the city centre, a day before they were due to leave for France, where they had been granted asylum. Jerf had made anti-IS films that made them a target for the group's sympathisers in Turkey.
Then, last month, Mohammed Zahir al-Sherqat, an opposition television presenter, died from shotgun wounds after they were attacked near a restaurant popular with Syrians.
The attacks have been accompanied by reports of sermons in IS-controlled towns in northern Syria, encouraging violence in Gaziantep. Friday prayers in Bab, Manbij and Jarablous have been used to announce that the southeastern province is among its “primary targets,” according to Turkish newspaper Yeni Safak.
Visitors to the city are now advised to keep a low profile and not to dismiss rumours of terrorist sympathisers tracking Westerners' movements. As recently as 2013, Leigh Turner, British Foreign Office director-general for trade & investment for Turkey, wrote that Gaziantep was key to “driving the integration process” for the EU and Turkey.
Now, the office advises against all but essential travel to the city, citing militant plans to carry out further attacks, which remain “likely”.
Syrians who fled to the city say they are increasingly nervous. They number 50,000 in camps in Gaziantep province – but nearly 300,000 more live in the city and surrounding area, according to the latest Turkish government figures.
Mohamad Taha, 22, originally from Deir Ezzor, said Syrians are forced to take security precautions – particularly since the deaths of Naji Jerf and Mohammed Zahir al-Sherqat.
“There is no security for Syrian activists,” they said. “Many are moving houses on an ongoing basis and do not linger in public places frequently. Sundays are a ‘black day' for them and they avoid going out at all unless it's essential.”
One Syrian civil society organisation registered as an NGO in Turkey put it more bluntly.
“We will not stay in Gaziantep because of security issues,” a spokesperson said, asking to remain anonymous for the sake of safety. “It will get worse and worse here, tensions with the Turks, because there are hundreds of thousands of Syrians here. Syrians have already been beaten in the street and this will happen more.”
One Syrian journalist in the city was last month the victim of an unsuccessful knife attack in central Gaziantep. They told MEE that they now limit their movements and avoids public places.
Syrians feel growing resentment
Tensions have risen between some members of the Turkish community and the increasing Syrian population. The newcomers struggle with lack of job opportunities, pay inflated accommodation costs and are victims of occasional violence from locals who feel threatened by their presence.
In 2014, rumours spread among local Turks that Syrians had poisoned the tap water – claims later denounced by both the city's mayor and water-and-sewage authorities. But the accompanying protests, staged to cries of “We do not want the Syrians,” were evidence of local sentiments.
“There are too many people here now,” said one Turkish staff member at Gaziantep's tourist office. “It is cheap for them here – at least cheaper than Europe. They can rent for $135 a month. They lost a lot of money and of course there are some with difficulties. But we have the same culture and we let them work. We understand them. Turkey is better than Europe for them.”
Those claims were countered by Syrians interviewed in Gaziantep, who said they faced increasing resentment from the Turkish population and were subject to systematic financial discrimination.
Three separate sources said landlords charged Syrians $235 a month for accommodations that would be offered to Turks for $100-$135.
“Living costs are high in Gaziantep,” said Mohamad Taha. “In terms of rent, it is the most expensive city near the border. The presence of Syrian organisations and third parties that deal with Syrians may have contributed to the price hikes.”
Syrians have stayed in Gaziantep, rather than move elsewhere in Turkey, partly through constraint. Refugee camps and aid programmes are concentrated in the east, away from Turkey's precious west-coast tourism industry. They have also stayed because of some cultural familiarity. The echoes of Syria's largest city in Gaziantep's mosques and marketplaces are not surprising, given many were built by the governor of Aleppo during Ottoman times, before the border was drawn between modern-day Turkey and Syria.
Visitors are staying away
The Turkish tourist board still distributes shiny pamphlets touting its “rich history, culture, and popular museums”. It also boasts of investment in tourism infrastructure, but the proximity to war means international tourists are staying away.

“It is supposed to [be] high season, but we have many fewer tourists,” said a staff member at the Asude Konak, a beautifully restored house from 1893 that now serves as a boutique hotel. “The advice of foreign offices in Europe and America, advising people not to come, has made things hard for us.”
Zincirli Bedesten, Huseyin Pasha Bedesten and Kemikli Bedesten – the city's most famous covered markets – buzz with people. But purchases appear to be confined to the basics. The piles of lavishly sugared loukums – Turkish delight – and the region's “Yemeni” style sandals seemed untouched.
Still, amid the complex problems, the city's economy remains healthy
Even with heavier demands on public services – rubbish collection, water and electricity use – and blows to the tourism sector, Gaziantep's economy has not declined as a result of the Syrian influx.
Syrians from Aleppo have taken to Gaziantep's bazaars and pale stone streets as merchants and restaurateurs, and have set up factories producing textiles, shoes and carpets.
A report last year from the Ankara-based Center for Middle Eastern Strategic Studies found that Syrians, with their excellent business contacts across the wider region, had boosted the economy by exporting Turkish goods to new markets. The same report found no evidence that Syrians were taking positions that Turks would otherwise fill. “Syrians are generally employed in areas that locals are not willing to work in,” it said.
Tammam al-Baroudi, director of the Syrian Economic Forum in Gaziantep, said the local economy had improved greatly since Syrians had moved in – although they could not provide figures
“Gaziantep was a quiet city before the revolution in Syria; now it is much more active. There has been a lot of change in three years, international and Syrian organisations work here, and their employees spend their money, drive their cars and live here. Syrian businesses operate and pay taxes,” they said.
The number of Syrian-owned businesses registered in Gaziantep rose from three in 2010 to more than 600 last year, with many in footwear, textiles and household goods. Smaller shops supply Syrian food and coffee – often superior to the Turkish variety – and mobile phone gear.
There are thought to be another 1,300 unregistered – non-tax-paying – Syrian businesses. And although inflation is high – year on year price rises early in 2016 were nearly 11 per cent in Gaziantep - Baroudi insists Syrian enterprise has not caused tensions with the Turkish population.
“We feel happy with the Turkish people and most of us feel relaxed in Gaziantep. Turkish shops in Gaziantep now write on their frontages in Arabic, and say they employ Arabic-speaking staff,” they said. “Now they are eating our bread and some of us are eating theirs. There is an exchange.”
The Gaziantep Chamber of Commerce did not respond to repeated requests for information on the city's economy.
Local government vows to protect civilians
Despite the threats from IS, local authorities say Gaziantep will be safe. After the car bomb attack on 1 May, politicians took to their social media channels to insist security forces and civilians would be protected.
Gaziantep Provincial President Mehmet Eyup Ozkeçeci of the ruling AK Party, said: "Our country will overcome terrorism.”
Gaziantep's AKP Mayor, Fatma Sahin, said: "With patriotism, our city Gaziantep will overcome these difficult times."
Local council officials did not respond to requests for specific comments on the security situation in the city.
Gaziantep beguiles and confuses. On one hand, visitors can wander its pale stone streets, drink in the smell of syrupy baklava and marvel at its restored old city.
At the same time, it is difficult to forget the words of the Syrian civil society organisation spokesperson who plans to leave: “The Turkish will let people beat Syrians in the street. Next year, we won't be in Gaziantep."
A bipartisan group of U.S. senators on the Senate Judiciary Committee is calling for former Attorney General Loretta Lynch to testify before them regarding their alleged interference in the Hillary Clinton email investigation.
A letter from four senators, Senate Judiciary Chairman Charles Grassley, Ranking Democrat Dianne Feinstein, Senator Lindsey Graham and Senator Sheldon Whitehouse, is requesting information regarding Lynch's communication with a Clinton campaign aide, Amanda Renteria in addition to documents and information that might indicate whether the FBI investigated the Lynch-Renteria communication.
That communication was reported in The Washington Post May 24; the Post alleged Lynch assured Renteria they would not permit a sustained FBI investigation into Clinton. A supposed email from Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, who was DNC chair at the time, mentioned the communication, but the FBI is not certain it is genuine.
Also fueling the drive into investigating Lynch was former FBI Director James Comey's testimony before the Judiciary Committee in which they stated that they were concerned that Lynch had instructed the FBI to refer to the Clinton investigation as a "matter,” language which the Clinton campaign preferred.
Sen. John Cornyn (R-TX) said it “would be very helpful” for Lynch to testify before the Judiciary panel. They asserted, “Frankly, a lot of what Hillary Clinton was exposed to by Director Comey's misconduct and the way they handled that was apparently in response to their lack of confidence in the attorney general, and I think there is a lot we could learn from that.”
Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) echoed that they wanted the Judiciary Committee to “get more involved … The accusations now that ... the current and former attorney general were political — that has nothing to do with Russia as much as it has to do with how the Department of Justice is being run. I want to find out all about that.”
Feinstein allowed, “I think we need to know more about that. And there's a only way to know about it, and that's to have the Judiciary Committee take a look at that.”
A spokesperson for Grassley said no decisions have been made and staffers needed to “gather evidence." But they admitted that it was “likely” that Lynch's testimony “will become necessary at some point.”
A spokesperson for Sen. Ted Cruz said Cruz would “absolutely” support Lynch testifying.
Comey had told Intelligence Committee members that they confronted Lynch as to whether they had decided to shut down the FBI's investigation. Comey expressed concern about their meeting with former President Bill Clinton at Sky Harbor International Airport in Phoenix. At the time, the FBI was investigating Hillary Clinton; Lynch was supposed to receive a recommendation of what action to take against Clinton, if any, from FBI director James Comey.
Lynch said at the time:
How's Your Annual Bonus? The Chinese Startup Luring Talent with a Tesla | By By Emma Lee
2 min read
The Chinese lunar New Year is just around the corner. Around this time, expectations among Chinese office workers are high in anticipation of the traditional year-end bonus. For most workers, it's a pleasant extra, not a windfall. But what if the incentive for this year takes the form of a car—a Tesla?
It may seem like a daydream, but this is exactly what is happening to the employees of WiFi Master Key (our translation), a startup backed by Chinese game developer and publisher Shanda. The firm is handing out a surprisingly generous year-end bonus this year by rewarding every member of staff with more than four months at the company with a Tesla.
A company representative disclosed that dozens out of the fifty current employees will receive this reward, but declined to name the specific number. It will cost the startup more than RMB30 million (US$4.8 million) in total, at current prices (RMB734,000 for the Model S) in the Chinese market. The first batch of eight employees received the cars last week. The electric car manufacturer also confirmed the news.
Growing out of Shanda's Innovation Institute, WiFi Key Master is a mobile app that automatically connects your devices to public WiFi networks when in range. The app claimed more than 500 million users as of the end of September last year, and 230 million monthly active users. It claims to have free access to 120 million WiFi hotspots across China.
“Talent is the key determinant for the success of high-tech companies. Through this move, we want to show how much we value and respect our talent”, said Chen Danian, the startup's founder (and twin brother of Shanda CEO Chen Tianqiao).
In recent years, China's booming internet companies have given lavish year-end compensation to employees in a bid to keep them motivated, retain their best workers amid tough competition for talent, as well as to display the company's exuberance.
This trend is led by the Chinese IT triumvirate known as the BAT (Baidu, Alibaba, Tencent). Baidu's bonus pool hit a record this year, with one top performer getting a bonus equivalent to 50 months' salary. One Alibaba employee showed off online, saying their bonus was worth more than 100 months' pay. Tenceng has yet to distribute its year-end bonuses, but it's rumored that staff at its gaming unit received a 68-month bonus last year.
Internet companies topped China's year-end bonus list with an average reward of RMB39,873 last year. Shanghai, Shenzhen and Beijing took the three top spots with average bonuses of RMB8523, RMB8235 and RMB7855 respectively, according to a recent survey by PXC.

Call it the revenge of the underclass: Even if you live in a gated community, have a bulging bank account, and enjoy bulletproof job security, you cannot escape the woes of the nation's have-nots.
As America settles into an uneasy period of high unemployment and stagnant growth, an imposing wall is forming between those with good jobs and the right skills, and many others left disenfranchised now that the Great Recession has rearranged America's economic landscape. And that is fueling the most bitter class warfare America has seen in generations. Nearly 15 million Americans are officially unemployed. Another nine million are working less than they want to because of the weak economy, and nearly four million more are barely working or are so discouraged they've given up looking for jobs. That amounts to 29 million Americans whose contribution to the economy has plummeted—a problem that could ultimately reshape politics and government and impact living standards for most Americans.
It's not obvious that this is everybody's problem, since the unemployed and undermployed tend to be the nation's least skilled workers. The unemployment rate among workers with a college degree or higher, for instance, is just 5 percent. Among high-school grads with no college, it's 9.7 percent, and among high-school dropouts it's 13.3 percent. Many of the unemployed are manufacturing and construction workers, or office workers who made a marginal contribution to their company's bottom line when they were working. Nearly 140 million Americans still have jobs, and it's easy for those who survived the Great Recession to credit their own resourcefulness and fault the unemployed for not doing more to help themselves.
But the comfortable inhabitants of leafy suburbs can no longer decouple their prosperity from the bleak fortunes of those in the unemployment line. It's well known that wealthy Americans have far more disposable income to spend on homes, cars, food, and most other goods and services. That creates the false impression that the wealthy can go it alone, regardless of what's happening to those less fortunate. In reality, there aren't nearly enough wealthy Americans to keep the economy growing or springboard it out of stagnation, and the inherently weak economy is now affecting nearly all consumers, regardless of income.
Average annual spending by consumers with incomes over $100,000, for example, is about $101,000, according to government data. Consumers with incomes below $70,000 spend only about $34,000 per year. But there are four times as many consumers in that lower income group than in the higher one, and overall, their spending is a lot bigger. Here's a breakdown:
Total annual spending for consumers with incomes below $70,000: $2.8 trillion
For consumers with incomes over $100,000: $2.1 trillion
For consumers with incomes over $150,000 (a subset of the group above): $1 trillion.
The spending that powers the economy, in other words, comes mostly from the middle and lower class, not from the wealthy. BMWs and Mercedes might give the economy luster, but Fords and Chevys make it hum.
The affluent were better insulated from prior recessions because two areas where their wealth tends to be concentrated—housing and the stock market—bounced back quickly from other downturns. Obviously that hasn't happened this time, and that's largely because so many lower-income consumers are in such tough shape. The S&P 500 stock index, for example, is comprised of firms like Wal-Mart, Dell, Johnson & Johnson, Procter & Gamble, PepsiCo, Verizon, and many other firms whose performance is tied to the behavior and spending of ordinary consumers. Big firms have been able to boost profits through deep cuts in payroll and other expenses, which has helped prop up stock prices. But that can't continue much longer. For corporate profits to rise in the future—along with the value of stock portfolios, for those lucky enough to have them—ordinary consumers will have to spend more. If jobs don't materialize, they won't.
Housing remains in a deep swoon, with the pace of sales at 1995 levels and prices down by more than 30 percent from the peaks of 2006. Since then, homeowners have lost more than $7 trillion in equity, a decline in net worth that hits wealthy consumers the most, since they're more likely to own expensive property. A pickup in housing—even at the top end of the market—is heavily dependent on a tangible pickup in employment, since that's what it will take for consumers and businesses alike to regain confidence and start investing in big purchases.
It's hard to draw direct cause-and-effect relationships between wealthy and poor consumers, yet big spenders are clearly retrenching like everybody else. Data from Gallup, the polling organization, shows that spending among all income groups has fallen by roughly the same amount since last year, coming in at 5 to 6 percent below 2009 levels. But in April and May, there was a surge in spending among wealthy consumers that has largely evaporated. For a while, it looked like "frugality fatigue" and hopes for a vibrant recovery were finally bringing out the shoppers, led by those with the highest incomes. But lower-income shoppers didn't follow. Instead, discouraging economic news popped that brief bubble of optimism and sent wealthy shoppers back into the bunker with everybody else. "Upper-income people can't wall themselves off," says Dennis Jacobe, Gallup's chief economist. "Everybody knows that if the average consumer is not spending, the economy is going to slow."
As America muddles along, the pressure on the wealthy will only intensify. President Obama wants to end the Bush-era tax cuts for higher earners, pushing the top two income-tax brackets up a few percentage points to 36 and 39.6 percent. That's still lower than the top rate of 50 percent in the 1970s and '80s, but it will add to an unusual degree of economic stress that the wealthy are already feeling. Obama wants to extend tax cuts for everybody else, which would no doubt deepen the rancor over who should pay for economic stimulus and the unfunded government giveaways of the last 10 years.
The wealthy may be asked to give even more as the nation tries to cope with a tide of socioeconomic refugees it hasn't seen since the 1930s. "The U.S. economy is not structured to have double-digit unemployment," says Jacobe. "We don't have the safety nets or the social programs." Among other things, that's been evident in a series of temporary extensions to unemployment insurance, which typically lasts just 26 weeks. With many unemployed workers on the sidelines for a year or more, Congress has passed several ad hoc extensions to help keep the long-term unemployed from falling into grinding poverty. But opposition is growing to unlimited extensions that keep ratcheting up the national debt, with no permanent solution to the jobless problem.
Few Americans favor a "welfare state" with lavish unemployment benefits that might make joblessness more appealing than work. But class warfare that pits high earners against lower ones won't accomplish much either. It's a lousy economy, and putting up more gates won't make it better. Opening a few of them might.
they Omar Abdullah government of Jammu and Kashmir has asked the Shri Amarnath Shrine Board (SASB) to reduce the number of pilgrims visiting the holy Amarnath cave for this year's yatra. Around 7.5 lakh people undertook the two-month-long pilgrimage that started toward the end of June last year. The Omar government has also rejected a move by the Union Ministry of Road Transport and Highways to widen the Khanabal-Panjtarni road on the way to the Amarnath shrine and declare it as a National Highway. These moves may lead to a direct confrontation between the new Central government led by Narendra Modi and Omar Abdullah, who is smarting from a defeat in the Lok Sabha elections.
The recommendation has come from the J&K Forest Department, citing environmental concerns, said highly placed sources in the government. "Heavy footfall and direct disposal of solid waste into the waters of Lidder and Sindh rivers have resulted in an alarming situation, including the outbreak of water-borne diseases," a senior Forest Department officer told this newspaper. The department has given reasons like saving glaciers and the forest cover.
Sources also said that earlier the district administration of Ganderbal communicated to the J&K government that the route to Amarnath could do with less human traffic and also expressed concern about the solid waste going into the Sindh. Sources said that the deputy commissioner of Ganderbal suggested erecting fences along the river to save it from littering at Baltal and other adjacent areas. Similar communication has come from the district administration of Anantnag.
It is in place to mention here that in the summer of 2012, the Supreme Court constituted a committee to give its recommendations to the J&K government on the measures to be implemented for the safety of Amarnath pilgrims. The committee recommended the widening of roads at different places on the way to the Amarnath cave in order to minimise pilgrim deaths from accidents. The J&K Forest Department opposed this, saying it will be detrimental for the "fragile eco-system" and a threat to "wildlife sanctuaries".
After Omar government's opposition to the widening of the Khanabal-Panjtarni road, Union Transport Secretary Vijay Chhibber has written to the J&K Chief Secretary Muhammad Iqbal Khanday asking the state to reconsider its decision. From Panjtarni, the road passes through Chandanwari, Pahalgam, Batakoot, and Martand before reaching Khannabal. The J&K government had said that the road should not be turned into a National Highway because it passes through the forests of Pahalgam and will disrupt the fragile ecosystem of the area.

The hundreds of suckers on an octopus's eight arms leech reflexively to almost anything they come into contact with — but never grasp the animal itself, even though an octopus does not always know what its arms are doing. Today, researchers reveal that the animal's skin produces a chemical that stops the octopus's suckers from grabbing hold of its own body parts, and getting tangled up.
“Octopus arms have a built-in mechanism that prevents the suckers from grabbing octopus skin,” says neuroscientist Guy Levy at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, the lead author of the work, which appears today in Current Biology1. It is the first demonstration of a chemical self-recognition mechanism in motor control, and could help scientists to build better bio-inspired soft robots.
To find out just how an octopus avoids latching onto itself, Levy and their colleagues cut off an octopus's arm and subjected it to a series of tests. (The procedure is not considered traumatic, says Levy, because octopuses occasionally lose an arm in nature and behave normally while the limb regenerates.)
The severed arms remained active for more than an hour after amputation, firmly grabbing almost any object, with three exceptions: the former host; any other live octopus; and other amputated arms. “But when we peeled the skin off an amputated arm and submitted it to another amputated arm, we were surprised to see that it grabbed the skinned arm as any other item,” says co-author Nir Nesher, also a neuroscientist at the Hebrew University.
And when the researchers presented amputated limbs to their former owners, the octopuses often behaved in an unusual way, dancing around their limb and rubbing it, but not attaching any suckers. (Intact octopuses also displayed this behaviour toward amputated arms.) When an octopus spotted the exposed flesh where the limb had been severed, it sometimes grabbed the flesh, but then held it only with its beak and only by the exposed flesh — as if it were licking its wounds. The rest of the limb was left dangling freely, untouched by the other arms.
Identity parade
The research also shows that octopuses are able to identify their own arms, even after amputation, says Binyamin Hochner, another neuroscientist at the Hebrew University, and the principal investigator in the study, as “they grabbed amputated arms of other octopuses as food items significantly more often than their own arms”. In many of those cases they actually ate the severed limb. Octopuses of this species, Octopus vulgaris, are known to be cannibalistic.
Octopuses' brains don't constantly monitor the exact position and motion of all of their arms; this would be very difficult because each arm has almost infinite degrees of freedom. Instead, each arm has its own 'motor controller' — a set of neurons that can control its motion independently of the rest of the body.
But sometimes the brain does step in. The fact that octopuses did eventually grab an amputated arm, but that a severed arm would never touch an octopus, suggests a conflict between what the arm is 'programmed' to do and what the brain sometimes decides to do. “We believe that the decision of the brain is much more complex and perhaps even involves high-level cognition,” says Levy.
The findings also demonstrate that vision is not the dominant sense for the octopus, and that chemical sense and touch are vital, says psychologist Jennifer Mather of the University of Lethbridge in Alberta, Canada, who was not involved in the study. “It gives us a window into the central-peripheral coordination that makes up an octopus's motor control,” says Mather.
But the study is “just a start”, they add. “The tests are pretty crude. We don't know anything about the chemicals themselves ... We don't understand either the type or the location of the interactions between central and peripheral control. But we can see where we should look.”

New Delhi: The government on Thursday made it clear that it is not in favour of reducing juvenile age from 18 to 16 years but is proposing changes in processes related to treatment of heinous offences committed by those in 16 to 18 age groups.
In a written reply in Rajya Sabha, Women and Child Development (WCD) Minister Maneka Gandhi said that there have been demands from many quarters to review the system and framework of juvenile justice.
"The Ministry is not in favour of reducing the juvenile age from 18 to 16 years," they said.
Gandhi, however, said that the Ministry is proposing modifications in processes which are followed while dealing with heinous offences committed by children in 16 to 18 age groups.
"In such cases, the Juvenile Justice Board may transfer the proceedings to a children's court, which is a Court of Sessions," the Minister said.
They said that in coming to a decision, the court would be assisted by able psychologists, psycho social workers and experts.
"The children's court will conduct an assessment of the physical and mental status capacity of the child to commit such offence and the circumstances in which the offence was committed," Gandhi said.
During the process of inquiry, trial and after trial, the child will be kept in a place of safety and not in a jail, they said.
"Under no circumstances the sentence passed by a court be life imprisonment or death," the Minister said.
Replying to another question, Gandhi said that a study report of National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR) indicates that 40 to 70 per cent of street children in different Indian cities are vulnerable to some type of substance abuse.
California has become the largest state to pass some version of the “4th Amendment Protection Act” in one of its lawmaking bodies. The Golden State's senate passed the bill on Monday, and the bill likely will come before the state assembly later this summer.
As currently drafted, the California bill prohibits “the state from providing material support, participation, or assistance to any federal agency attempting the illegal and unconstitutional collection of electronic data or metadata, without consent, of any person not based on a valid warrant that particularly describes the person, place, and thing to be searched or seized or a court order, or in accordance with judicially recognized exceptions to warrant requirements.”
State Senator Ted Lieu (D-Torrance), who authored the bill, told Ars that the bill is a “substantive and symbolic” way to counter the effects of the National Security Agency (NSA). Lieu is an Air Force veteran who served as a prosecutor in the Judge Advocate General corps, and they currently serve as a Lt. Colonel in the Air Force reserves.
“There's nothing that says that states have to cooperate with a federal agency,” they said. “States can do what they want so long as they don't violate the law. We see no statute that says that the 50 states have to follow NSA's orders. Let's say the NSA wants to track down 100,000 people in California and they want it from the employment database. [The bill] would say no, you're prohibited from giving it. [Federal authorities] would have to get it through other means. The states can't stop them, but we can make it harder to violate constitutional rights.”
Throwing up obstacles
Legal experts wonder if this bill is merely symbolic at best.
“Like I've said before, I think the real import of these kinds of bills is to send a strong signal that states are not only uncomfortable with the NSA's spying, but they also reject the legal rationale behind much of its warrantless surveillance,” said Hanni Fakhoury, a staff attorney with the Electronic Frontier Foundation. “The bill makes clear that obtaining any of these sorts of records or data without a warrant is illegal.”
“A state—even California!—cannot regulate the federal government, but what this Act does say is that state officials will not cooperate,” Ruthann Robson, a law professor at the City University of New York, told Ars. “This could have a significant impact if federal officials are relying on state law enforcement. It could also mean that a person who is being surveilled could sue state officials and receive money damages, if someone could prove the state officials cooperated in an infringement of that person's state constitutional rights.”
Robson cited, for instance, frequent and ongoing cooperation between the New York Police Department and federal agencies. And as presently written the bill would only apply to state agency activity such as that. Fakhoury said they never actually heard of a situation where a federal agency asked a state agency to hand over data. More often than not, it's companies that are targeted for data handover and are compelled to do so under court order. Still, the attorney believes the bill could have some modest impact on future cases.
“But the rejection of the legal rationale is interested in my opinion because in a way it could impact state law in the future,” Fakhoury added. “That means the next time a criminal defendant in a state court case raises a challenge to a state law enforcement's agency's warrantless collection of these types of records, there's a stronger argument that the California legislature disapproves of this warrantless request as evidenced by this bill. It's obviously not binding law on those state officials, but again it shows the legislature's intent.”
Nullification
For the moment, nearly all the bills that have been proposed or floated appear to come from a group calling itself “Nullify NSA.” Its website provides no contact information beyond a Twitter account and a Bitcoin address. The site provides “model legislation” at the state and local level, and it says a “campus resolution” is coming soon.
Other states that have introduced similar language include Alaska, Arizona, Indiana, Kansas, Mississippi, Missouri, New Hampshire, Oklahoma, Tennessee, and Washington.
In an e-mail, “Michael B.” previously told Ars that Nullify NSA was organized by the Tenth Amendment Center and the Bill of Rights Defense Committee. These are groups that advocate constitutional nullification, the legal theory that an American state can nullify, invalidate, or ignore federal law that it doesn't like.
State Sen. Lieu compared it to the federal law that makes marijuana a crime, while under California state law, it remains legal for medical purposes. In short, federal agencies likely could still raid state offices if they wanted to, or the NSA could simply surreptitiously intercept data as it sees fit.
“We don't quite know what the NSA does or doesn't do, but we do know that there often is cooperation,” they said. “I support much of what the NSA does and they do protect America. My problem is specific programs, like bulk collection. I am a strong believer in national security until it violates the constitution.”

Ninety-three animals were adopted within 90 minutes at an adopt-a-thon Saturday in Akron, Ohio.
It was the first time the halls of the Summit County Animal Control Center weren't echoing with noises from cats and dogs.
“It was insane," said Christine Fatheree, the director of the center. "There are always 20 or so animals left over from adopt-a-thons, but the place was completely empty."
Fatheree told USA TODAY Network that an anonymous couple donated $500 to the center two days before the sixth annual adopt-a-thon, so the first 50 adoptions were free.
They said several of the people who adopted pets cried when they learned the adoption was free.
“We didn't advertise that the first 50 pets were free because we didn't want people running down here without thinking about what adoption means,” they said. “This is a living being you have to take care of.”
Several of the cats had been with the shelter since June and Fatheree said they felt like the animals would never find a home.
“It's always frustrating with the cats because people don't want to adopt a cat when they can get one for free on a corner,” they said.
They said even several shy cats that refused to come out of their litter boxes were adopted.
“I don't know if social media got the word out, but we have never had an event like this,” they said. “It was overwhelming.”

Experts warn that global warming is tipping climate into ‘uncharted territory', as Met Office, Nasa and Noaa data all confirm record global temperatures for second year running
2015 smashed the record for the hottest year since reporting began in 1850, according to the first full-year figures from the world's three principal temperature estimates.
Data released on Wednesday by the UK Met Office shows the average global temperature in 2015 was 0.75C higher than the long-term average between 1961 and 1990, much higher than the 0.57C in 2014, which itself was a record. The Met Office also expects 2016 to set a new record, meaning the global temperature records will have been broken for three years running.
Temperature data released in the US on Wednesday by Nasa and by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa) also showed 2015 shattered previous records.
Experts warned that the record-breaking heat shows global warming is driving the world's climate into “uncharted territory” and that it showed the urgency of implementing the carbon-cutting pledges made by the world's governments in Paris in December.
Heatwaves have scorched China, Russia, Australia, the Middle East and parts of South America in the last two years, while climate change made the UK's record December rainfall, which caused devastating floods, 50-75% more likely.
The Paris agreement commits the world's nations to limit warming to below 2C compared to pre-industrial times, or 1.5C if possible, to avoid widespread and dangerous impacts. But the Met Office data, when compared to global temperatures before fossil fuel burning took off, shows that 2015 was already 1C higher.
A strong El Niño event is peaking at the moment, putting the “icing on the cake” of high global temperatures. El Niño is a natural cycle of warming in the Pacific Ocean which has a global impact on weather. But scientists are clear that the vast majority of the warming seen in 2015 was due to the emissions from human activity.

“Even without an El Niño, this would have been the warmest year on record,” said Prof Gavin Schmidt, director at Nasa's Goddard Institute for Space Studies. They said they expected the long trend of rising global temperatures to continue because its principal cause – fossil fuel burning – was also continuing.
“It is clear that human influence is driving our climate into uncharted territory,” said Prof Phil Jones, from the University of East Anglia's Climatic Research Unit, which produces the temperature record – called HadCRUT4 – with the Met Office. Peter Stott, at the Met Office's Hadley Centre, said 2015 was the first year global average temperature was more than 1C above pre-industrial levels.
Noaa's global temperature records stretch back to 1880 and it also found 2015 was the hottest year yet, beating the previous high by a record margin. The agency also found December was warmer than any other month in the record, when compared to long-term averages. Ten of the 12 months in 2015 had record high temperatures for their respective months, according to Noaa.
Nasa's new data for 2015 also shattered its previous record and showed 15 of the 16 warmest years on record have occurred since 2001.
“Climate change is the challenge of our generation,” said Nasa head Charles Bolden. “Today's announcement is a key data point that should make policymakers stand up and take notice - now is the time to act.”
The Nasa, Noaa and HadCRUT4 temperature records all use independent methods to calculate the global average. They use many thousands of temperature measurements taken across the globe, on land and at sea, each day.
There are uncertainties in the measurements, partly due to fewer measurements in the polar regions, and these are included in the calculations. Stott said: “Remaining uncertainties are clearly much smaller than the overall warming seen since pre-industrial times.” Another independent temperature record, from the Japan Meteorological Agency, indicates 2015 was by far the hottest year on record.

Bob Ward, at the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change at the London School of Economics, said: “This [record heat] should put pressure on governments to urgently implement their commitments to act against climate change, and to increase their planned cuts of greenhouse gases. The warming is already affecting the climate around the world, including dangerous shifts in extreme weather events. Those who claim that climate change is either not happening, or is not dangerous, have been conclusively proven wrong by the meteorological evidence around the world.”
Despite constantly rising greenhouse gas emissions trapping ever more heat on Earth, the last decade has seen relatively slow warming of air temperatures, dubbed a “pause” in climate change by some. In fact, global warming had not paused at all.
Instead, natural climate cycles led to more of the trapped heat being stored in the oceans (which already absorbed most the heat), some of which El Niño is now releasing. Scientists usually assess changes in climate over decades, rather than years, and the of the last four decades has been warmer than any decade on record before.
“It's the long term warming trend we need to worry about rather than one hot year,” said Prof Piers Forster, at the University of Leeds in the UK. “So we shouldn't get too excited - but it is certainly a sign of things to come.”
So by now everyone should have seen the SquirrelFish announcement. And MagLev. And you've see Steve Yegge's presentation, "Dynamic Languages Strike Back". And you've been following the discussion about the relative merits of stack versus register based VMs.
As an aside, note that the Java VM is stack based and the Dalvik VM on Android is register based.
All of those things on their own are interesting, but what's more important is that we're talking about them all at the same time. There's real research going on to produce faster VMs and that research is being applied to real scripting languages today. What we are priveleged to witness, something that wasn't happening a year ago, and will probably be complete in another year or two, is the professionalization of scripting languages. There was a time when you could whip out a parser in lex and yacc, stitch together a naive VM and throw it over the wall and you'd have a new scripting language. Those days are coming to a close and in a few years (if not months) you won't be able to get traction with anything unless it does direct threading, is register based, has generational GC, does peephole optimizations, does trace-folding, does type-inferenced inline caching, etc. That's not a bad thing, real work being applied to improving the performance of scripting languages is great and should greatly increase the areas where they'll be applied as long standing concerns about performance are removed and the benefits of increased productivity come to the fore.
If you haven't been keeping up on all of this then start with the three papers that the SquirrelFish announcement references. They're clear, well written, and are a good starting place before diving into the rest of the literature.
And yes, it's all true, once you trace all of this stuff back it all eventually leads to Smalltalk. Poor old disrespected Smalltalk, all those years of work, all that cutting edge research, and nary a bit of credit, which is particularly galling if you think about the fact that, to date, the language that has benefitted the most from Smalltalk is Java.
During these first days of Donald Trump's Presidential transition, the elevator at Trump Tower has become a character in its own right. Whom does it carry up to meet the President-elect? Unable to get past the lobby, beat reporters have stationed themselves there and reported the comings and goings. Shinzō Abe, the Prime Minister of Japan, went in. So did Robert Kraft, the owner of the New England Patriots, and the Republican Senator Jeff Sessions, of Alabama, Trump's nominee for Attorney General. Out came Jared Kushner, Trump's son-in-law, who reportedly has expressed interest in working at the White House, and the retired general Michael Flynn, Trump's new national-security adviser. The lobby became a scene. The lefty filmmaker Michael Moore hung out there with a camera crew, and a professional skateboarder named Billy Rohan claimed that he, too, had met with the President-elect. The answer to the underlying question—what types of Republicans are entering that elevator and, therefore, likely to staff this Administration?—has proved elusive, because they don't come from a single ideological camp. Perhaps we are overthinking it, and their ideologies matter less than his. These are simply the Republicans who are interested in working for Donald Trump.
So far, the President-elect has leaned toward their campaign loyalists, heightening many of the fears that were provoked by their campaign. Last Sunday, there was the elevation of Steve Bannon, who did as much as anyone to invent the white-nationalist alt-right, to the role of chief strategist. Sessions, who has a long history of racism and voter suppression (as my colleague Amy Davidson noted today), will be litigating the relationship between the states and minority communities. Flynn, an Islamophobe and right-wing conspiracy theorist, will play a leading role in foreign policy. And yet Trump's circle during the campaign was so small that they are fast approaching the limits of the group that could plausibly occupy government posts. If there has been any optimism since the latest staffing announcements, it has been about the fact that Trump may now have to turn to run-of-the-mill Republicans. “Trump has exhausted their bench of Full Trumpists,” the Times columnist Ross Douthat tweeted this morning. “What comes next will be interesting.”
Interesting, but probably not too surprising. Because many Republican élites found Trump's rhetoric and personality abhorrent, they overstated the extent of their policy differences. But almost the entire Party shares Trump's preference for lower taxes and fewer regulations on corporations. The President-elect's alarmism over Sharia law coming to America, insistence that the science behind climate change is at best disputed, suspicion of the Black Lives Matter movement, and conviction that President Obama signed over national sovereignty to international institutions are common to many other G.O.P. members. However shallow the bench of what Douthat calls “Full Trumpists,” there is a party full of people with every incentive to squint, remember all the issues on which they agree with the President-elect, and conclude that they are on their side.
This squinting action has been apparent among Republican élites for a while now. Trump won the election with the support of a surprising number of prosperous, well-educated Mitt Romney voters. The stock market shuddered and dipped each time Trump edged closer to the Presidency, but after they were actually elected and gave a reassuring speech it held strong, and the talk from Wall Street was suddenly about the war on regulation to come, and not the possibility of irrational wars. As late as June, only one senator and a dozen representatives had endorsed Trump, but when they met for the first time after the election they donned red “Make America Great Again” hats. “It's time to come home,” Mike Pence told dissident Republicans, at the end of the campaign, and for the most part they have.
One of Trump's triumphs in the Presidential election was to put pressure on the character of each opposing candidate (“Lyin' Ted,” “Crooked Hillary”). Now the first part of their Presidency seems likely to put pressure on the character of the Republicans around him, on what they will and will not tolerate. On what issues might members of Trump's Cabinet be willing to take a stand against him? They may not matter much. On Thursday, there was a flurry of liberal optimism when news outlets reported that the President-elect would meet with Romney about the possibility of them becoming Secretary of State. But it is worth remembering that Richard Nixon had a moderate Secretary of State, William Rogers, who did little to restrain their foreign policy. George W. Bush had Colin Powell, and the moderate Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill. Bill Clinton had the left-winger Robert Reich. The personal convictions and qualifications of Cabinet members matter a great deal, but considerably less than the personality of the President of the United States. There, we know the score.
Though proofreading is something that a lot of people don't think a lot about, it is one of the most vital parts of publishing a blog post. Writing and content is important, but it doesn't mean anything if your readers can't make it through your post because of errors. A while back I wrote a post How to Proofread Your Posts Before Publishing because it's really important to have a system in place so that proofreading every post is easy, and having a list of things to edit for will help.
Having a list is a great way to stay organized and create a strategy. You should build from my list and make one that applies to you – because everyone struggles with different elements of writing. Though you may be excellent at spelling or grammar, you might struggle with certain tenses or verbs, and you should put those specific examples on your list to make sure you always catch the mistakes. So start with this list, and use it to create your own! Here's what I've got so far – I'll be adding things as I think of them over time!
Cliches
Cliches are the worst. They are as stinky as old cheese. They are just a waste of time. They are just gut wrenching. You see where I'm going with this, right? I wrote a post a little while ago – Pro Writing: Cliches – How to Avoid Them & Why You Need To. If you're not careful, cliches can really drag down a good post. Make sure to edit every post for them!
Tense
Though tense isn't something many people think about, it can ruin a post if you let it. Tense means switching back and forth between present, past, future, etc. in your writing. Of course, switching around is okay if you're actually talking about things that happened versus things that are going to happen, but most people do it all in one post that should be written in the same time period. For more informaiton about tense and how to do it right you can read my post Pro Writing: How to Maintain Your Tense.
Grammar
There are so many different grammar rules that you need to keep an eye out for when you are proofreading your posts. In my opinion, the most important ones are commas and apostrophes. When they are placed right, they help your writing make sense and go unnoticed, but when they are wrong they can break the flow and really tear your writing apart. I don't have a post on grammar just yet – mostly because I need to figure out how to properly use commas myself (they are my weakness) but proofreading will help you catch the most obvious grammar mistakes.
Headline Grammar
You may or may not know this, but your headlines have their own grammar. The rules apply mostly to how you should capitalize them. There are certain words that you never capitalize, certain words you always should, and certain words that depend on where they are placed. For some details you can check out my post Headline Grammar – How to Capitalize and Why You Should, because headlines are a vital part of every post, and a grammar error there might warn people off before they even start reading.
Verbs
Verbs are the most powerful parts of every sentence. They should be front and center in every sentence, and they should have true meaning. When I started out in school for professional writing, one of the exercises we repeated over and over again was to go through a piece and highlight every single verb. Then we would go through it again and make sure every one of those was as strong as it could be. Verbs can be weak in a few different ways. The first is when you haven't chosen the right one. For example. Why say ‘running fast' when you could say ‘sprinting'. It cuts out an unnecessary word and has such a more powerful meaning. The second is when the verb you intend to use isn't really the verb at all. If you say ‘I am writing for my readers', ‘am' is the verb, though you probably meant it to be ‘writing'. Instead change the sentence to ‘I write for my readers'. You can already tell how the sentence feels so much more powerful, and the meaning is truly where you want it to be.

This one is something that a lot of people struggle with, and it's something that really bothers a lot of people. When you use the wrong form or spelling of a word. There are hundreds of different examples of this, and everyone struggles with different ones. Some of the most common are:
they're, there, their
right, write
its, it's
two, too, to
then, than
You should make a list of the ones that you struggle with the most, and then make sure to edit for those on every post. Once you do this enough, using the right forms will be something automatic for you.
Spelling
Spelling is the first thing that people think of when they imagine proofreading, but it is only one small element in a long list of things to edit for. Most programs like Microsoft Word check your spelling as you write, and now WordPress even does it right in the post editor window. These are the spelling errors that are easy to catch because they are pointed out to you. But, you also need to proofread the post and check for spelling errors yourself, you can't just rely on the built-in editor. This is because the editors are just checking that the words you type are real words spelt correctly, they don't check that they make sense in the sentence or are the correct word. Read over a post yourself to see that all the words you meant to type ended up there.
Once you've built a list of things to edit for that's custom tailored to you and the things you struggle with, print it off and use it every time you write and edit a post. Eventually you'll start to catch fewer errors, and eventually you might overcome some of your writing problems altogether!
GREEN BAY, Wis. — It was one misguided pass, thrown in one frustrating moment as part of one rough season.
But when the ball came to rest in the hands of Packers cornerback Sam Shields in the Green Bay end zone Sunday, it was another opportunity lost, another touchdown that evaporated, another reason for first-year St. Louis Rams offensive coordinator Josh McDaniels to rub their face as if they were trying to make it all go away.
“There are always throws you want back,” Rams quarterback Sam Bradford said. “That's obviously one I want back. We just have to find a way to change our mistakes into touchdowns. I think everyone's comfortable with the plan. We just have to find a way to do better.”
When McDaniels was fired as Denver's coach last December with an 11-17 record, the Broncos talked about restoring the “integrity” of a franchise with two NFL titles. They talked about rebuilding “the faith” of the fans and reconstructing the roster to “a championship level.”
But when McDaniels was hired by St. Louis coach Steve Spagnuolo to jump-start an offense on what had been considered a team on the rise, it looked like they had made out just fine.
The Rams were 7-9 in 2010, played for a postseason berth in the regular season's final week and had a franchise quarterback in Bradford, a former Oklahoma star and the No. 1 pick of the 2010 draft.
Bradford passed for 308 yards and three touchdowns against McDaniels and the Broncos as a rookie, leading the Rams to a 36-33 victory in Denver.
Yet the Rams are 0-5 this season and rank last in the 32-team league in scoring, averaging only 9.8 points. Bradford is limping with a high ankle sprain they suffered on the final play of Sunday's 24-3 loss to the Packers. They have been sacked more than any other quarterback in the league. The Rams gained 424 total yards against the defending Super Bowl champions but failed to score a touchdown.
“We've been able to move the ball up and down,” Bradford said, “but we just have so many mistakes, it doesn't allow us to put the ball in the end zone. We've got to find a way to score touchdowns. The way we've played at times has been positive. We understand we can do that and there's no reason, if we keep working, we can't do that in the red zone, that we can't score touchdowns.”
McDaniels has talked about getting it right, about the Rams trying to play their best football offensively in November and December. They have saluted Bradford's resolve amid all the hits and emphasized the importance of Bradford continuing to stand in the pocket to make the necessary throws.
“We have to find a way to do better. Looking back doesn't do you much good,” McDaniels said. “We're going to find that formula.”
Even before the Packers sacked Bradford three times Sunday, Mc-Daniels said: “Every quarterback gets hit. And we want ours to be hit less, there's no question about that. We've got to do a better job of making sure that happens. But that's part of their job. He's going to take some shots, and as a quarterback I don't think there's anything more satisfying than getting hit and making a play at the same time.”
Injuries have slowed the Rams' progress. They lost wide receiver Danny Amendola for the year in Week 1 and lost running back Steven Jackson for several weeks after their first carry in the season opener.
The schedule has been brutal, with the Rams already having played the Redskins, Ravens, Giants, Eagles and Packers. Games against the Cowboys, 49ers (twice) and Saints remain. Looking for hired help, the Rams on Monday traded for wide receiver Brandon Lloyd, a Pro Bowler with the Broncos. Lloyd resurrected their NFL career when McDaniels brought them to Denver. They had 77 catches for 1,448 yards and 11 touchdowns in 2010.
“As long as we keep grinding, grinding in this system — we know it works — there's no reason it won't come soon,” Bradford said.
“Josh came (into the Green Bay game) with a good game plan,” Jackson said. “These guys were ranked third against the run and we moved the ball. We think we can do better, especially in the red zone. We know we can, but we don't accept losing or moral victories.”

Federal Environment Minister Greg Hunt has given approval for "ecological thinning" trials in a new national park on the Murray River, a move green groups say marks the first time logging has been permitted in forests granted the highest level of protection.
At the end of last month, the Environment department approved with conditions selective logging over five years in 44 plots within the Murray Valley National Park in NSW.

The previous Victorian coalition government had earlier pulled out of the trials in their state's side of the Barmah-Millewa forest, the largest stands of river red gums in the country.
The NSW government has argued that the viability of high-density stands of red gums is at risk during extended droughts, citing research done towards the end of the dry spell in 2009 – just prior to the creation of the national park the following year.
AT&T hopes to reverse a trend that has seen Skype and other Internet telephony services start to displace its voice-call business over the past few years. The carrier is now encouraging outside programmers to create voice and messaging apps that use its customers' traditional mobile phone numbers.
In announcing a new programming interface earlier this week in Las Vegas, the company turned to one of its many disruptors, Tropo. That company already provides voice and messaging apps over the Internet, and its platform will form the basis for developers to write apps that manipulate mobile calls—changing how calls are placed, received, and forwarded—and that merge voice messages with text-messages and e-mail.
Over the past year or so, operators around the world have moved in a similar direction. Telefonica, the Madrid, Spain-based carrier with operations in several countries, launched Tume, a messaging and voice app that adds shared photos to the mix. The European carrier Orange late last year launched its Libon—with multiple voice and messaging apps, including voice-mail that allows you to customize your greeting for each caller and see icons of their faces. And in the United States, T-Mobile's service Bobsled—which also provides ways to consolidate voice, text, and social media communications—has taken off in the past year.
One early application using the AT&T interface is Myanumber, a service geared toward families. A child need only remember one number: if Dad doesn't answer, the call goes to Mom's phone; if they don't pick up, it gets forwarded to a friend. The call could be set to be delivered to a phone, or through a Web browser; and an attempted call could be turned into a text-message, or a voice-mail attached to an e-mail message.
The API is part of a larger effort by AT&T to court developers (see “AT&T Looks to Outside Developers for Innovation”), which included a hackathon in Las Vegas last weekend that attracted 400 developers.
Even as smartphone adoption surges, the reality for carriers is that revenue from mobile voice and messaging around the world is expected to decline about $1 billion a month this year—from a total of $758 billion in 2012 to $746 billion in 2013—according to Yankee Group, a Boston-based analyst firm.
“What they've lost in terms of voice and SMS usage and revenue has been largely replaced by data services,” says Richard Karpinski, a senior analyst at Yankee Group. “The time is right for them to take some risks and innovate on the voice side.”
Even if innovative apps don't generate new voice revenue, the hope is that they will help keep customers in the fold. Carriers are increasingly wary that cool new innovations—such as Snapchat, an app that lets photos sent by text vanish after a few seconds—can catch on fast.
“A lot of small companies can create something completely new, overnight, and if it catches on, it can spread broadly, and completely change how communications is done,” Karpinski says. The messaging app Whatsapp has taken business away from major mobile operators, particularly in Europe.
Last year, Verizon and AT&T both made an early step to get ahead of such trends. With new Web-based messaging and voice apps cropping up, the two U.S. giants started including unlimited voice and text-messaging in some data plans. “If AT&T is not taking these actions to provide better solutions, there are over-the-top [Internet-based] players who will do the same thing,” Ed Schmidt, AT&T's executive director of platform development, said in an interview from Vegas.
Depending on how developers merge different services, AT&T and other carriers can act as “the connective tissue between various over-the-top voice/messaging services, turning competition from a negative to a positive,” Karpinski added.
Since forming a first look deal with the Fox Networks Group last week, producer Scott Rudin has quickly set up three plum projects that will be developed as potential series. They just preempted rights to the Adam Higginbotham book The Invisible Enemy: The Untold Story Of The Battle Of Chernobyl, which Rudin acquired in proposal form just as the book was selling to Simon & Schuster in a heated bidding war that ended with a near-seven figure deal. It will be developed as a limited series for the Fox-owned Nat Geo, which is aiming to get into ambitious original scripted fare. The deal comes just as Rudin opens their offices on the Fox lot this week, led by producer Garrett Basch.
The other two projects will be developed as potential series for FX. SRP acquired Southern Bastards, a Southern fried crime drama based on a graphic novel about a power struggle between the son of a former sheriff of Craw County, Alabama who returns to a hometown controlled by a local criminal and revered head coach of the powerhouse high school football team. FX has scored with crime stories like Justified and Sons Of Anarchy, and this has similar scope. Jason Aaron & Jason Latour, who wrote it, will be exec producers and they will adapt it. SRP is also in negotiations to set at FX City On Fire, a sprawling 900-plus page novel by Garth Risk Hallberg that Rudin acquired in 2013 with their own money, before the book sold for $2 million in a publishing deal with Knopf. It is set in New York in the 1970s and will be a major title published in the fall. The Southern Bastards deal was negotiated by Harris Miller and Angela Cheng-Caplan.
Rudin is known in the literary community for being a book loving producer who is decisive and aggressive enough that they often close deals before rivals know what hit them. Their relationship with pedigree authors has led them to make deals based on a few pages of description. They bring all that to the Fox deal, as evidenced by the speed in which they closed The Inside Enemy before the nuclear meltdown tale got a chance to be a hot property.
The Chernobyl disaster chronicle is describing an in-depth moment by moment account of the disaster and the horrible aftermath. This includes the Kremlin's initial denial, the dogged reporting by journalists like Dan Rather, and the catastrophic economic cost to the Soviet Union that contributed to its insolvency. The meltdown is covered as the events unfolded, from the workers inside the reactor who tried in vain to close off containers by turning valves by hand, to the reaction of engineers and workers in nearby Priyap; down to the discovery of particles that set off radiation readings at a nuclear facility in Sweden that days later prompted the USSR to finally admit to the the accident. CAA brokered the publishing and TV deal for the author.
Rudin has always run their operation from New York, with Eli Bush heading SRP's Gotham office. The new guy running the West Coast outpost at Fox is Basch, who co-founded Film Rites with Oscar winning Schindler's List scribe Steve Zaillian and worked with the writer for years on film and TV projects that included the Rudin-produced The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo and Moneyball. Film Rites has its own first look deal on the feature side at Fox and Basch will continue to produce projects they percolated with Zaillian that include Cascade, which has Baltasar Kormakur directing and Cate Blanchett attached, and the spy thriller Red Sparrow. Rudin and Basch will also continue to collaborate with Zaillian on projects. Basch also was exec producer on Crime, the upcoming Zaillian-created HBO series that Zaillian co-wrote by Richard Price. This was the project whose pilot episode originally starred James Gandolfini before their untimely death. Zaillian directed seven of the eight episodes (The Walk helmer James Marsh did the other), and John Turturro replaced Gandolfini in the lead role. Basch separately produced Life Itself, the Steve James-directed documentary on Roger Ebert, winning the Producers Guild, Critics Choice and National Board of Review Awards last year.
As Deadline reported last week, Fox Networks Group head Peter Rice will rely on SRP to generate prestige programming for FBC, FX and Nat Geo.

Chelsea's bid to sign Atletico Madrid hot-shot Radamel Falcao has been given a huge boost.
The Spanish club has expressed an interest in re-signing Fernando Torres at the end of the season.
And that means Chelsea can now pursue a deal that would see Torres ­return to Atletico and ­Falcao move to Stamford Bridge.
But Chelsea's valuation of Torres and their £175,000-a-week wages will provide the biggest stumbling block.
But Chelsea will be ­desperate to offload Torres and sign Falcao, who has a ­£46million release clause in their Atletico contract.
New Bavaria ­Munich boss Pep Guardiola could provide ­competition for Falcao's signature.
A Spanish source said: “Despite all their problems at Chelsea, Torres is still held in great affection at Atletico and they would be welcomed back.”

If I knew what I knew in the past
I would have been blacked out on your a** —Kanye West, Black Skinhead
Because I am a prominent advocate for founders running their own companies, whenever a founder fails to scale or gets replaced by a professional CEO, people send me lots of emails. What happened, Ben? I thought founders were supposed to be better? Are you going to update your “Why We Prefer Founding CEOs” post?
In response to all of these emails: No, I am not going to rewrite that post, but I will write this post. There are three main reasons why founders fail to run the companies they created:
The founder doesn't really want to be CEO. Not every inventor wants to run a company and if you don't really want to be CEO, your chances for success will be exceptionally low. The CEO skill set is incredibly difficult to master, so without a strong desire to do so the founder will fail. If you are a founder who doesn't want to be CEO, that's fine, but you should figure that out early and save yourself and everyone else a lot of pain.
The board panics. Sometimes the founder does want to be CEO, but the board sees them making mistakes, panics and replaces them prematurely. This is tragic, but common.
The Product CEO Paradox. Many founders run smack into the Product CEO Paradox, which I explain below.
The Product CEO Paradox
A friend of mine led their company from nothing to over $1 billion in revenue in record time by relentlessly pursuing their product vision. They did so by intimately involving themselves in the intricate details of their company's product planning and execution. This worked brilliantly up to about 500 employees. Then, as the company continued to scale, things started to degenerate. They went from being the visionary product founder who kept cohesion and context across the increasingly complex product line to the seemingly arbitrary decision maker and product bottleneck. This frustrated employees and slowed development. In reaction to that problem and to help the company scale, they backed off and started delegating all the major product decisions and direction to the team. And then they ran smack into the Product CEO Paradox: The only thing that will wreck a company faster than the product CEO being highly engaged in the product is the product CEO disengaging from the product.
This happens all the time. A founder develops a breakthrough idea and starts a company to build it. As originator of the idea, they work tirelessly to bring it to life by involving themselves in every detail of the product to ensure that the execution meets the vision. The product succeeds and the company grows. Then somewhere along the line, employees start complaining that the CEO is paying too much attention to what the employees can do better without them and not enough attention to the rest of the company. The board or CEO Coach then advises the founder to “trust their people and delegate.” And then the product loses focus and starts to look like a camel (a horse built by committee). In the meanwhile, it turns out that the CEO was only world-class at the product, so they effectively transformed themselves from an excellent, product-oriented CEO into a crappy, general-purpose CEO. Looks like we need a new CEO.
How can we prevent that? It turns out that almost all the great product-oriented founder/CEOs stay involved in the product throughout their careers. Bill Gates sat in every product review at Microsoft until they retired. Larry Ellison still runs the product strategy at Oracle. Steve Jobs famously weighed in on every important product direction at Apple. Mark Zuckerberg drives the product direction at Facebook. How do they do it without blowing their companies to bits?
Over the years, each one of them reduced their level of involvement in any individual set of product decisions, but maintained their essential involvement. The product-oriented CEO's essential involvement consists of at least the following activities:
Keep and drive the product vision. The CEO does not have to create the entire product vision, but the product-oriented CEO must drive the vision that they choose.  They are the one person who is both in position to see what must be done and to resource it correctly.
Maintain the quality standard. How good must a product be to be good enough? This is an incredibly tough question to answer and it must be consistent and part of the culture. It was easy to see the power of doing this right when Steve Jobs ran Apple, as they drove a standard that created incredible customer loyalty.
Be the integrator. When Larry Page took over as CEO of Google, they spent a huge amount of their time forcing every product group to get to a common user profile and sharing paradigm. Why? Because they had to. It would never have happened without the CEO making it happen. It was nobody else's top priority.
Make people consider the data they don't have. In today's world, product teams have access to an unprecedented set of data on the products that they've built. Left to themselves, they will optimize the product around the data they have. But what of the data they don't have? What about the products and features that need to be built that the customers can't imagine? Who will make that a priority? The CEO.
But how do you do that and only that if you have been involved in the product at a much deeper level the whole way? How do you back off gracefully in general without backing off at all in some areas? At some point, you must formally structure your product involvement. You must transition from your intimately involved motion to a process that enables you to make your contribution without disempowering your team or driving them bananas. The exact process depends on you, your strengths, your work style and your personality, but will usually benefit from these elements:
Write it; don't say it. If there is something that you want in the products, then write it out completely. Not as a quick email, but as a formal document. This will maximize clarity while serving to limit your involvement to those things that you have thought all the way through.
Formalize and attend product reviews. If teams know that they should expect a regular review where you will check the consistency with the vision, the quality of the design, the progress against their integration goals, etc., it will feel much less disempowering than if you change their direction in the hallway.
Don't communicate direction outside of your formal mechanisms. It's fine and necessary to continue to talk to individual engineers and product managers in an ad hoc fashion, because you need to continually update your understanding of what's going on. But resist the attempt to jump in and give direction in these scenarios. Only give direction via a formal communication channel like the ones described above.
Note that it is really difficult to back off of any non-essential involvement yet remain engaged where you are needed. This is where most people blow themselves up: either by not letting go or by letting go. If you find yourself where my friend found themselves — you cannot let go a little without letting go entirely — then you probably should consider a CEO change. But don't do that. Learn how to do this.

Just down the street from Detroit's famous Motown Museum is another building, also dedicated to one of the Motor City's musical legacies, and arguably just as important. You'd never guess from its unassuming exterior — unlike Hitsville USA, it doesn't even have a sign, making it all but invisible to only the most diehard of fans.
That's exactly how Underground Resistance want it.
The label and collective, founded by producers Jeff Mills and "Mad" Mike Banks in the late '80s, came to rise during Detroit techno's second generation in the '90s. The group developed a reputation for a socially conscious message and a militant, mysterious aesthetic, its members often performing disguised by bandanas. So it's only natural that UR's headquarters is also cloaked in anonymity too.
"That's the underground way. That's what underground is," says John Collins, a DJ and producer and our guide for the day. "A lot of fans do research and find out about it. People come to the door, 'We hear there's a techno museum here in this building.' I'm like, 'Yeah, you want to come in?'"
UR acquired the building, a former UAW Union Hall, in 2002, filled with trash and debris. Today, it's the home of UR and Submerge, the label's management and distribution company, as well as "Exhibit 3000," a museum dedicated to the birth and rise of Detroit techno. The exhibit stems from a project with the Detroit Historical Museum more than a decade ago, originally intended to travel the world — when that didn't happen, it settled here.
"This is like mecca for true techno fans," says Collins. "'I've seen people come in here and start crying. Or people come in here and stand up against the wall. I'm like, 'Are you OK?' They just can't move. We're very proud of this place and what techno has done for the world — and more specifically, that it has come from Detroit."
Collins guides us to the exhibit's first showcase, seemingly containing a recipe of the necessary ingredients to create the environment that would one day birth Detroit techno. There are photos of Motown founder Berry Gordy, and Coleman Young, Detroit's first black mayor. There's the jacket to The Mental Machine, a book by popular DJ the Electrifying Mojo, an early champion of Detroit techno (who once invited Young to join them on air). The case also contains LPs by Kraftwerk and P-Funk (a nod no doubt to musician Derrick May's famous quote describing Detroit techno as if "George Clinton and Kraftwerk are stuck in an elevator with only a sequencer to keep them company.") The bottom row contains science-fiction ephemera — such as Star Trek — which illustrated the idea of "species coming together and cohabitating peacefully on the starship Enterprise," as Collins explains.
That brings us to the second showcase, which features photos of the first generation of Detroit techno artists: Juan Atkins, the asupervisorstioned May, Kevin Saunderson, and Eddie Fowlkes, along with early techno releases like "Alleys of Your Mind" and Clear by Atkins' outfit, Cybotron. "A lot of people come here and they have no idea who the founders were," Collins says. "When I tell them they were African-American, they're like, 'What?' They just could not come to terms with a black person creating this type of music."
When asked to differentiate Detroit techno from other forms of electronic music, Collins drums out a quick beat with their feet and hands: "bum-da-bum-da-bum-bum." "There are computer-generated sounds, but there was a soulful element in it as well, which you would only be able to do if you were from Detroit," they say. "When the music migrated and went overseas, they couldn't do it the same way as these guys."
But it's the way that soulfulness interacts with the machine-made music that creates techno's intriguing tension. "House (music) was more structured," Collins says. "With techno, you had more freedom to do things that don't have to make sense. A musician probably could not sit down and play (Atkins') 'No UFOs' — it's really weird. The timing isn't right, and things happen when they're not supposed to happen."
Collins says the music reflects what Detroiters were going through in the '80s, pointing out that many early artists would pose in front of run-down buildings for publicity photos. There's a darkness too, evident in early records by acts like Cybotron. "It reflected what was going on — it was scary, it was dark, it was deep," Collins says. "But the music was futuristic — it's giving you hope for the future, that things will get better."
Collins moves on to the second generation of Detroit techno, and indicates a photo of himself, almost unrecognizable in long dreadlocks (he says they cut them following a kidney transplant they had a year ago). Collins made a name for themselves as a resident DJ at a now-defunct club called Cheeks, which is when they first met Mills, then known as "The Wizard." "Jeff is one of the most gifted DJs in the world," Collins says. "He's on a whole other higher plane. He's up here scientifically, musically, and everyone else is down here." Collins recalls when Mills came to audition for a gig at Cheeks: "He went into the booth, and our mouths just dropped to the floor — records flying, scratching — just amazing. Never had I seen anything like that before in my life. I hired them on the spot."
Another legendary DJ featured in the display is Ken Collier. "He was like Frankie Knuckles was to Chicago or Larry Levan was to New York," Collins says. "He DJed at a club called Heaven, which was a gay club — probably one of the best clubs ever in Detroit. A lot of people would go just to hear them play. Their programming was off the hook. Anything they played, people just soaked it up."
Collins then takes us to a room containing all manner of keyboards, synths, and 808 and 909 drum machines. One machine, noticeably older, stands out among the rest. Collins says that it's the lathe that Ron Murphy used to master many Detroit techno recordings with their company Sound Enterprises. A nearby framed 2001 Metro Times article describes it as "a machine built in 1939 that looks like a giant Art Deco sewing machine."
Though they aren't originally in the business of mastering records, Murphy wound up becoming the go-to guy for Detroit techno records, thanks to enthusiastic fans in Atkins and May. "When they were first approached by these guys, they were like, 'What is this stuff?'" Collins says. "This was from another planet." Soon everyone in Detroit was coming to them to master, and not long after that, people from around the world. Upon Murphy's death in 2008, they left the lathe to UR in theirs will.
Lastly, Collins takes us down to the basement, which houses a record store stocked with UR's releases and signature black T-shirts emblazoned with their logo, its walls and ceiling covered in countless signatures visitors and fans. (You'll also find DJ Alley Cat — quite possibly the friendliest cat in all of Detroit, named for their habit of pawing spinning turntables. "When we first found her, they stayed away from everybody," Collins says. "It took a while, but now she's like a dog.")
Above the stairs is a map of the world, with pins indicating UR's fans. Quite a few are scattered around Michigan. A great many more are evenly clustered throughout Europe. But the pins extend across the planet — there's even a few on New Zealand. Below the map, a sticker sums up the phenomenon: "Techno brings people together."

AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - Daisy Oehlers and Bryce Fredriksz, a Dutch couple in their early 20s, were sitting near the left wing of Malaysia Airlines Flight MH17 on their way to a holiday in Bali, when “high energy objects” - as officials later called them - struck the plane over eastern Ukraine.
Their bodies were torn apart and scattered across miles of the conflict zone below.
Three months later, Daisy's cousin Robby checked into a cheap hotel in Donetsk to start searching the area for any trace of their relatives. “There was a crater from a rocket impact just next to the nose part of the aeroplane,” they said. “I found a blue suitcase. It wasn't hers.”
Oehlers, a singer, and the relatives of as many as 50 other victims are growing increasingly frustrated by the fact that the authorities have not helped them trace loved ones lost on July 17, when the flight from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur was shot out of the sky.
All 298 passengers and crew - two-thirds of them Dutch – were killed. The Dutch government, a leading Russian trading partner, still hesitates to call it an attack.
Attempts to recover parts of the aircraft and human remains have repeatedly been called off due to fighting on the ground. Families also say the Dutch government is not giving them enough information. One law firm has said it is preparing to sue the government for negligence over its handling of the case.
Bryce and Daisy's relatives have Bryce's foot and part of a bone for Daisy, but no more. Relatives of nine people on board the Boeing 777 have no remains at all. Some families are waiting for enough body parts to hold funerals.
“How much do you need?” asked Oehlers. “30 percent? 40 percent?”
They spent three days searching the site between Donetsk and Luhansk, the rebel-held eastern Ukrainian towns that have been flashpoints in the conflict, and took a TV crew to draw attention to their family's mounting anger. They said they saw signs of bombardment on the field, where stray dogs wandered. Winter is approaching. As fighting persists, the families' hopes diminish.
“You just wonder; what are they doing?” they said of the authorities. “If it was another country, they'd just grab their stuff and head out there. I don't know what the spirit of Dutch politics is, but I think they are too soft.”
HELD TO ACCOUNT
The Dutch are conducting two parallel investigations: one into the cause of the crash, and a criminal inquiry - the single largest in Dutch history. There are now 100 Dutch law enforcement officials involved in that case, including 10 prosecutors, said spokesperson Wim de Bruin.

But no forensic investigators have made it to the crash site. That makes the recovery of evidence nearly impossible.
Washington says it has intelligence that overwhelmingly backs the theory that the plane was shot down by a missile fired by pro-Russian separatists. Russia denies any involvement.
Many Dutch also believe the plane was downed by rebels using missiles provided by Moscow. But their leaders, mindful of the country's heavy reliance on Russian energy, have never assigned blame. Prime Minister Mark Rutte has called on Russian President Vladimir Putin to assert their influence over the rebels.
Pieter Omtzigt, legislator with the opposition Christian Democratic Appeal party and a member of the foreign affairs committee, says the government is not being open enough.
They submitted a list of 43 questions about the disaster, of which they said 29 went unanswered, including one about Russian and Ukrainian cooperation and whether crash investigators had access to key U.S. intelligence.
“On all these questions, we haven't had an answer,” they told Reuters in an interview. “I want to see full proof - if you kill 298 people you have to be held accountable.”
“COME GET ME!”
The challenges facing the Dutch investigators are extreme.
The closest comparison is the bombing of Pan Am flight 103, over Lockerbie, Scotland, in 1988, which killed 254 people. The investigation, conducted in peacetime Scotland, took three years, during which 4 million pieces of evidence were recovered from a crash site spanning 2,000 sq km (770 sq miles). It took a decade to go to trial.
“We searched rivers, lochs and reservoirs and recovered many personal effects, pieces of aircraft and debris, as well as other much more difficult ‘recoveries' I'd rather not go into here,” said one police diver involved in the search.
Even then, the trial of two Libyan intelligence agents, at a specially constituted Scottish court in a disused Dutch military base, secured only one conviction. To this day, many relatives are convinced that the man eventually convicted was innocent.

In the Netherlands, Rutte is under growing pressure: their popularity has dropped since the MH17 crash.
Silene Fredriksz, Bryce's 51-year-old mother, said they are having difficulty sleeping. “It is simply taking too long,” they said. “I hear them call: ‘come get me!'”

In India, Russian expats and visitors often get stumped with the kind of questions that are not really part of street talk back home.
Last month when I wrote this article about the most irritating questions that an Indian gets asked in Russia, many Russian friends and readers said they also have to deal with annoying questions in India. The more feedback I received, the more I chose to ask Russians I know in India and tourists about what kind of questions that annoy them the most. I was a bit surprised with the answers but I couldn't hide a grin when I heard the most common ones.
Are you veg or non-veg?
This is a fair question when you want to invite someone home for a meal or take them or them out to a restaurant, but the Russians I spoke to insist that this is something they get asked in the most casual of conversations.
A friend said they were asked this question by a total stranger while they were shopping in Bangalore's Commercial Street! Others commented that this question was thrown at them at tourist sites after they agreed to pose for selfies or photographs with Indian tourists.
Vegetarianism is gaining popularity around the world but the chances of someone from Irkutsk or Archangelsk being a veggie is still low at the moment.
Are you married?
There may be different motivations behind asking this question to men or to women, but again when it comes from virtual strangers, it is not pleasant.
Some women, who come to India regularly for yoga or dance lessons or to spend time in ashrams, tend to wear a ring just to shake off annoying men. Pretending to be married or engaged often does the trick. A former radio journalist, who speaks fluent Hindi and is now a part of the diplomatic corps, once even put up a Facebook post saying that they aren't looking to be anyone's “bibi,” as they got many marriage proposals from their online friends.
The men also get asked this question but this is more about curiosity than anything else. An employee of a Russian company with operations in India says the question is just asked to break the ice.
What's your salary?
This, in my opinion, is a downright inappropriate question and has no justification of any kind. I get this question from over-curious relatives and from new acquaintances in small town India, but the Russians I spoke to say that this is one of the most common questions that they get in Indian metros.
Whether it's diplomats, tourists or those working in India, that question is often asked without an eyelid being batted. Most people I know choose to just say that they don't want to answer that question and that it's considered poor manners in Russia.
Some friends tend to make up some figures just to see how the person asking the question would react.
What's your religion?
For a person like me who get irritated by the caste question in Russia, I can empathize with the Russians who get asked the religion question in India.
It's just that religion is such an important part of the lives of a vast majority of people in India that many can't fathom the idea of society where there are many non-believers or just non-religious people.
The Russian Orthodox Church's message is being increasingly accepted by people across the country, but a large number of Russians tend to still be overly agnostic, if not totally atheist. But like in Europe, most people prefer to keep their religious views private.
What do your parents do for a living?
Russians value the institution of family as much as we do in India, but tend to be a lot more reserved when it comes to personal questions.
Quite a few of my friends were surprised with the question about their parents' profession and asked me if this had anything to do with the caste system. I laughed and replied that it was just a part of the over-curious nature of people more than anything. This question largely came from middle-aged people and not from the young.
One Russian who worked for a telecom major in India for a few years said they could read strange expressions on the faces of people when they told them that their father was a truck driver. They said the responses ranged from “almost sympathy to a feeling of pride that a son of a truck driver could become a senior executive with a multinational.” I found the latter a bit surprising since it's common now to hear about people from humble backgrounds achieving great things in India. Of course this friend did not go into detail with anyone about the concept of dignity of labor in the erstwhile Soviet Union, where their father drove trucks for over three decades.
When it comes to annoying questions, whether they are in Russia or India, one needs to take a deep breath and understand that the intention behind them is almost never bad.

Former vice president and longtime environmental activist Al Gore campaigned hard against Donald Trump, saying their election “would take us toward a climate catastrophe.”
But now that Trump will soon be occupying the Oval Office, Gore is extending an olive branch, saying in an online posting this week that they will do everything they can to work with the incoming administration to ensure that the United States remains a leader in combating the harmful effects of global warming.
“President-elect Trump said they wanted to be a president for all Americans,” Gore wrote on the website of the Climate Reality Project, the advocacy group they founded with a mission of helping accelerate the shift from dirty fossil fuels to renewable energy. “In that spirit, I hope that they will work with the overwhelming majority of us who believe that the climate crisis is the greatest threat we face as a nation.”
Gore is not naive, of course. Their note was like others this week, wishing the new president well and offering to work alongside a Trump administration in the months ahead. But they must realize that Trump isn't likely to call soon for advice on climate policy.

[Trump victory reverses U.S. energy and environmental priorities]
For starters, Trump is a climate skeptic, who has called the notion of global warming a hoax.
In addition, the “energy independence” section of Trump's transition website includes ideas that no doubt make Gore and the environmental-advocacy community cringe.
“Rather than continuing the current path to undermine and block America's fossil fuel producers, the Trump Administration will encourage the production of these resources by opening onshore and offshore leasing on federal lands and waters,” the site states. “We will streamline the permitting process for all energy projects, including the billions of dollars in projects held up by President Obama, and rescind the job-destroying executive actions under their Administration. We will end the war on coal, and rescind the coal mining lease moratorium, the excessive Interior Department stream rule, and conduct a top-down review of all anti-coal regulations issued by the Obama Administration.”
Trump also has vowed to scrap President Obama's Climate Action Plan, which outlines actions to reduce carbon dioxide emissions and increase energy efficiency around the country. They have promised to “cancel” U.S. participation in the landmark Paris climate agreement, a move scientists and activists say could undermine international efforts to slow global warming. And they want to gut the Obama administration's Clean Power Plan, the key regulatory attempt to slash carbon emissions domestically and speed up the move toward cleaner sources of energy.
The transition site does say that Trump is “firmly committed to conserving our wonderful natural resources and beautiful natural habitats.” But there are no specifics on what that might mean, other than “America's environmental agenda will be guided by true specialists in conservation, not those with radical political agendas.”
Last month, in a Miami rally with Hillary Clinton, Gore implored voters to consider the candidates' vastly different approaches to climate change, which they called a top national and global priority.
“The world is on the cusp of either building on the progress and solving the climate crisis, or stepping back, washing our hands of America's traditional role as the leader of the world and letting the big polluters call the shots,” Gore said then. “The choice is that clear. It's that stark. The consequences for not just our children and grandchildren and future generations, but for all of us, are really quite significant. . . . We must have a president who gets it, who cares about it, who's internalized it, who's passionate about it.”
Gore alluded to their razor-thin loss in Florida 16 years earlier and warned those concerned about climate change not to be complacent.
“Elections have consequences,” they said. “Please take it from me: Every single vote counts.”
