Deluge 1.3.15
May 12, 2017
A bug fix release that resolves a few issues introduced in 1.3.14 along with other minor fixes.
Network Proxy Settings:
Since libtorrent 0.16 there has only been a single proxy that applies to all types (Peer, web, etc.) so to prevent bugs with accidentally unsetting the proxy values Deluge now only sets a single proxy but mirrors the settings from peer type to the other proxy types for user display only to show that proxy is enabled for all connections. In the GTKUI this means that the other types are greyed out and will be unable to be set. This is a stopgap measure for 1.3 code and is properly fixed for 2.0 release.
Deluge WebUI:
Highly recommended upgrading to this release as it contains a directory traversal security fix that once again has the real potential to compromise your machine.
Windows OS:
The dialog button locations will now be uniform across the application. A proper fix to copy the Windows OS button placement will be implemented for 2.x release. See #3012
There is a confirmed shutdown bug with the standalone client (classic mode) so before shutting down or logging off on Windows, either ensure Deluge is closed or run in thinclient mode. See #3011
Please see the ChangeLog and the ​'Revision Log' for the full list of changes.

Horse racing is one of America's oldest traditions dating back to 1665 when the first track was built in Long Island. Because of this, I truly believe that every man should know a bit about horse racing. For me, there's just something about watching the horses circling the track that causes hundreds of years of excitement to course through my veins. Plus, whiskey is often involved, but I'll get to that…
Today, according to WinningPonies.com, horse racing has become one of the most popular spectator sports in America. The Kentucky Derby alone garnered roughly 14.8 million viewers in 2012, the third most watched Derby Day in 23 years. People generally gather for miles to attend traditional events like Derby Day as well as the Preakness Stakes and the Belmont Stakes. These three races together comprise the U.S. Triple Crown of Thoroughbred Racing for 3-year-old horses, and they're always a good time. If a racehorse wins all three of these races, they're awarded the Triple Crown Trophy. Only 11 horses have ever won.
In the United States, Thoroughbred horses tend to dominate this classy world of horse racing. Thoroughbreds are the breed most used in American horse racing because they're what's called a “hot-blooded” breed. These breeds are known for their speed and agility whereas “cold-blooded” breeds are known for their brute strength. The terms don't actually have anything to do with the temperature of their blood, but more so their attitudes. Hot-blooded horses are more temperamental while cold-blooded horses are generally calmer.
HOW TO BET ON A HORSE – THE BASICS
Whereas horse tracks don't have to be the glorified gambling arena's they've grown to be, betting on the horses definitely makes it more fun. But if you're not into gambling, the admission is typically free, you can still spend the day out in the sun, you can usually bring your own food and drinks, and you're sure to still be entertained, gambler or not. It also makes for a great date! I tend to go and gamble a bit while my ladyfriend swoons over how beautiful the horses are.
So, how do you place the bets? There are two types of wagers you can place while handicapping, or choosing horses to bet on at the track: straight wagers and exotic wagers.
Straight wagers are great for beginners. They limit you to only bet on a single horse to win first, second or third. It's the easiest way to have a good time at the track without emptying your wallet.
Exotic wagers are a bit more complicated, though may earn you the most profit. With exotic wagers, you can bet on multiple horses.
Types of Straight Wagers
Win – Bet that your horse will come in first place. You win.
Place – Bet that your horse will come in first or second place. If your horse places, collect. You'll have a higher chance of winning, but the pay won't be as high as a “win“ wager.
Show – Bet that your horse will come in first, second or third place. You'll have a higher chance of winning, but the pay won't be as high as a “win” or a “place” wager.
Across The Board – Bet that your horse will “win”, “place” and “show”. If your horse comes in first, you win the “win”, “place” and “show” pay. If your horse comes in second, you win the “place” and “show” pay. If your horse comes in third, you only win the “show” money. This is generally called a “combo straight wager” because it's technically three bets in one.
Win/Place – With a win/place bet, bet that your horse will “win” and “place”. If your horse wins, you win the “win” and “place” money. If your horse comes in second, you only win the “place” money.
Place/Show – With a place/show bet, be that your horse will “place” and “show”. If your horse finishes second, you collect the “place” and “show” payout. If your horse finishes third, you only win the “show” money.
Types of Exotic Wagers
Exacta – Bet on two separate horses to come in first and second in that exact order. If your two horses finish in the order you chose, you win.
Quinella – Bet on two horses to come in first and second in any order. If your two horses both finish in first and second, you win.
Trifecta – Bet on three horses that will finish in first, second and third in that exact order. If the three horses you chose finish in the exact order you bet on, you win.
Superfecta – Bet on four horses to finish in first, second, third and fourth in that exact order. If the four horses you chose finish in the exact order you bet on, you win.
Boxing
If you chose to “box” your exacta bet, you're paying extra for the two horses you chose to be able to finish in any order. It sounds a lot like quinella, but the difference is the payout. Box exacta bets typically pay more than a quinella.
You may also choose to box your trifecta or superfecta bets so that the three or four horses, respectively, can finish in whatever order they finish in. Again, the payout is higher, but remember, you're paying more money to box your bets in the first place.

HORSE RACE PARTIES
Of course, you don't always have to go to the track to enjoy this fine equestrian sport. As I mentioned above, 14.8 million people watched the Kentucky Derby last year. The Kentucky Derby, “known as the most exciting two minutes in sports”, is arguably the pinnacle of horse racing all year round as it kicks off the first leg of the Triple Crown at Churchill Downs in Louisville, Kentucky. Hell, there's even an entire two-week festival preceding the actual race called the Kentucky Derby Festival.
Often, people gather to celebrate the Kentucky Derby as well as other races around the country. I know that I have a neighbor from Saratoga who loves hosting parties whenever the races are televised. They're always fun and, if nothing else, yet another excuse to drink more whiskey.
The Mint Julep and Variations
The Mint Julep has been a staple at Churchill Downs since 1938. Over 120,000 mint juleps are served in collectable glasses at Churchill Downs each year, some costing over $1,000 a glass for charity. These cocktails are served in gold-plated cups with silver straws and are made from Woodford Reserve bourbon, mint from Ireland, sugar from Australia, and spring water ice cubes from the Bavarian Alps. For $1,000, it'd better be a damn good drink, though I wouldn't know.
Aside from that specific Mint Julep, for the past 18 years, the Early Times Mint Julep Cocktail has been the “official mint julep of the Kentucky Derby”, even though Early Times is not technically a bourbon, the main ingredient in my juleps.
Ingredients:
4 fresh mint sprigs
2 ½ ounces of bourbon
1 teaspoon of powdered sugar
2 teaspoons of distilled water
Directions:
1. Muddle mint leaves, powdered sugar and water in a Collins glass.
2. Fill the glass with shaved or crushed ice and add bourbon.
3. Top with more ice and garnish with a mint sprig.
There are even a few variations of the mint julep that you may want to try. Mixologists Rob Floyd and Bobby “G” Gleason recently came up with a few variations of their own, the Blueberry Julep and the Knob Creek Storyville Julep.
The Knob Creek Storyville Julep
Ingredients:
1 1/2 parts Knob Creek Bourbon
1/2 part Thin Honey Syrup (3 parts honey, 2 parts water)
1 1/2 parts Fresh Pressed Pineapple Juice
6 Fresh Mint Leaves
Club Soda
Directions:
1. Muddle pineapple, honey syrup and mint in an Old Fashioned Glass
2. Fill with ice, add Knob Creek and stir top with club soda.
3. Garnish with a pineapple clip and mint top.
The Blueberry Julep
Ingredients:
2 parts Basil Hayden's Bourbon
8-10 Mint Leaves
7-8 Blueberries
1 part Fresh Lime Juice
3/4 parts Simple Syrup
Directions:
1. Muddle mint leaves and blueberries in mixing glass.
2. Add Basil Hayden's bourbon, lime juice and simple syrup and shake.
3. Fine strain into a rocks glass with crest ice.
4. Garnish with blueberries and mint sprig.
Kentucky Derby Style
One great thing about Kentucky Derby parties is the gentlemen's ability to dress to the nines in his seersucker (left) or khaki suit, mimicking that timeless southern style that seems to really only be acceptable at the Kentucky Derby.
Bright colors are always acceptable at the Kentucky Derby, so why not at your party too? In fact, it seems as though the more you stand out at a Kentucky Derby event, the more welcomed you are. So play the part, suit up like a classic Southern gent, sport your outfit with confidence and you'll surely look like a winner.
Derby Games
If you are hosting your own Kentucky Derby party, you're going to want to provide entertainment for your guests aside from the actual races. There's a good chance that a few people you invite may not actually care for horse racing. You can easily entertain by offering a few different games to play. A rousing game of horseshoes may do the trick.
You can also gamble at home with a derby pool. Just place numbers 1-20 on individual pieces of paper representing all the different horses at the Derby. Fold the pieces and place them in a hat. Have each of your guests pull a different number from that hat. The number they pick will correspond with the horse they'll have to root for during the race. Whoever's horse wins gets a prize, whether it be money that people have thrown into a pool or a pre-bought gift. Either way, it'll be the most exciting two-minute pool you'll ever throw.
If you want to actually bet on the horses, you can sign up at twinspires.com for only $100 to bet. If you're strapped for cash, you can go in on the bet with a few buddies and split the earnings if you win.
– – –
If horse racing is something you'd like to get more involved with, make sure you do so with caution. Gambling can be addictive and harmful if not controlled. If you look at horse racing a mere entertainment rather than a way to make a quick buck, you're bound to have a lot of fun. Especially if there are mint juleps involved. Mmm…

When I first heard that Crishaun “CeCe” McDonald–the 24-year-old black transwoman prosecuted for surviving a white supremacist and transphobic assault–would be housed as a man at the Minnesota state prison at St. Cloud, I felt panicked and pissed.
I wasn't alone. On Twitter, The View's Sherri Shepherd declared it “cruel punishment.” A Shepherd follower responded, “No no now, this is AWFUL! Seems like a definite death sentence for CeCe.” And the poet Ursula Rucker shouted (virtually), “There's alot going on here…racism, sexism, homophobia, xenophobia…all equals one big fat INJUSTICE!!!”
While the “big fat INJUSTICE!!!” part remains a give-in among people with common sense, progressive observers and advocates, I was surprised to learn that McDonald's local supporters are in wait-and-see mode regarding her placement.
“So far, CeCe is doing pretty [well]. She has a relatively positive attitude and she's been excited to see the support around her remaining throughout the process,” says Katie Burgess, the executive director of the Minneapolis-based Trans Youth Support Network. Burgess maintains constant contact with McDonald and she serves as a key strategist in what has become an international support campaign.
“People tend to think about how CeCe identifies as a woman and say she should be able to go to a women's facility. But there's really no history of transgender people being placed according to their gender identity. So once CeCe is placed in a permanent facility, she'll look around and decide if she feels safe there. If she doesn't, she'll move forward with a civil suit against the Department of Corrections to be relocated to a safer place. That may or may not be a women's prison.”
At the moment, the larger issue for McDonald is the state's evaluation process. Over the next month, says Burgess, an ad hoc committee of prison health officials and wardens will form to determine McDonald's gender (you read that right), whether or not she'll continue to receive the hormones she's been prescribed in the past and if she'll be placed in administrative segregation, which is really just a glorified version of solitary confinement.
“In my experience, the committee process is remarkably abusive and just disgusting,” says Burgess. “Generally, they're made up of all non-transgender people with absolutely no cultural sensitivity. They look at three things: physiology–meaning your genitals–sex orientation and prior placement. Rather than protecting transgender people, who are easily the most vulnerable group when it comes to sexual violence in prison, the underlying idea is that transgender people are sexual predators.”
It's hard to imagine that the fashion student, who did nothing more than defend herself against a white female who sliced her in the cheek with a cocktail glass and a Swastika-tattooed Dean Schmitz, would be deemed a sexual aggressor. But Mara Keisling, executive director of the National Center for Transgender Equality, says this idea lies at the foundation of transwomen's experience in prisons and jails.
“From a detention point of view, the assumption is that transwomen are men and transmen are women. The basic idea is that if you have a penis, you will commit sexual assault. You may have fully developed breasts, hips and long hair, but that's still the assumption,” says Keisling. “Sexual assault in these situations is pretty rampant; most of it comes from staff rather than transgender inmates.”
In late May, the Department of Justice issued long-awaited policies in connection to the 2003 Prison Rape Elimination Act (PREA). The new PREA policies, which are voluntary, include additional avenues for reporting sexual assault by staff members, a call to end targeting transgender people for genital inspection for the sole purpose of determining gender, and limits on solitary confinement in the name of safety. The advocates I spoke with aren't very optimistic about how these rules will affect McDonald and other transgender women of color.
“The message that CeCe's been really clear about is that there is really no safe place for her within the Department of Corrections,” says Burgess. “The wording around whether or not transfolks should have some say in where they're placed is weak. We may be able to use PREA rules to give individuals more voice in the process, but it's too early to tell.”
Clearly this is a complex issue. In followups, I'll explore PREA rules in depth and keep an eye on the fate of CeCe McDonald.
Rioting erupted in Birmingham, with a police station set on fire and stores looted in what police described as "mindless thuggery".
Trouble flared around the station in Holyhead Road, Handsworth, and also involved police cars being targeted.
Shops damaged in the city centre included a McDonald's restaurant and an Armani store at the Mailbox centre.
About 130 were arrested, some of which Chief Constable Chris Sims described as "astonishingly young".
There were 700 to 800 people on the streets last night outnumbering police two to one, the West Midlands Police chief added.
'Run amok'
More than 400 officers will be on duty on Tuesday evening with shifts extended from eight to 12 hours.
Thirteen people out of 28 injured on Monday night seen by crews went to hospitals, the ambulance service said.
Several premises were attacked with shop windows smashed and property stolen in various locations in the centre as well as some surrounding areas.

A heavy police presence was seen in the city from late afternoon. Some shops in the city centre closed early.
BBC reporter Grant Sherlock said the window of Mills City Express store, in Colmore Row, was smashed by youths wielding a bin.
He said some had then run into the store before emerging with goods in their hands.
Vans of police in riot gear soon arrived and the youths dispersed.
At a press conference earlier on Tuesday, Mr Sims said pictures of all offenders would be posted on the police's website in a bid to identify them.
Shortly after, another group broke through the metal security shutter of the Jessops store in Temple Row and cameras and electrical equipment were taken from inside, he said.
In New Street, a front window of the Adidas store was smashed and empty coat hangers littered the street outside.
'Twitter intelligence'
Another eyewitness, Chris Scrivens, said youths had "run amok" in the grounds around the cathedral.
"I saw one guy put a window through of a shop. Another one picked up the debris.
"They were kicking over motorcycles," he said.
Police in riot gear were positioned in several parts of the city centre, with some advising onlookers to get off the streets.

Arrests were made for various offences, including violent disorder and aggravated burglary.
Some parts of the city centre remain cordoned off as forensic officers examine scenes of disorder.
But all roads are open and the city is "open for business as usual", police said.
Police said they had been aware of "Twitter intelligence" from lunchtime on Monday, suggesting there would be trouble in the city during the evening.
Later on Monday, at 23:45 BST, the West Midlands force confirmed the police station in Holyhead Road was on fire.
The force also reported some of its cars had come under attack in the street.
Ambulance crews were called to 34 incidents, the majority of which were reports of people being assaulted.
Image caption Looters ransacked this shop in the city centre
Assistant chief ambulance officer Tracey Morrell said: "The majority of incidents have been as a result of assaults, but thankfully most have not been too serious."
There were no reports of any serious injuries as a result of the disorder, police said.
Shabana Mahmood, Labour MP for Birmingham Ladywood, said the incidents in Birmingham had been "mindless criminality".
She said: "Obviously we have to have a debate and consider whether there are underlying reasons and learn some of the lessons potentially from some of these incidents as well."
Councillor Paul Tilsley, deputy leader of the city council, said the authority was making every effort possible to clear up any damage and bring normality back to the city.
He said earlier: "We'd stress to retailers, workers and shoppers alike that the city remains very much open for business and would encourage them to come in as normal."
Russian and Chinese military have drilled the protection of the territory from the strikes of ballistic and cruise missiles during the computer-assisted missile defense command-and-staff exercises in Moscow, the Russian Defense Ministry's Press Service and Information Directorate told Interfax.
"The main objective of the computer-assisted command-and-staff exercises is to drill joint actions of operationally formed groups of Russian and Chinese air defense and missile defense to protect the territory from random and provocative strikes of ballistic and cruise missiles. The objectives have been fully accomplished during the drill," the Russian ministry said.
The exercises were held at the decision of the chiefs of the Russian and Chinese defense agencies on the premises of the Russian Defense Ministry's Central Scientific Research Aerospace Defense Institute in Moscow from May 23 to 28.
"The joint exercises were not directed against any third party," the Russian Defense Ministry said.
This is the first joint Russian-Chinese computer-assisted command-and-staff exercises. It is codenamed Aerospace Security 2016.
"During the exercises the tasks have been drilled: coordination of the approaches to interaction in resolving missile defense tasks; determination of the principles of the use of joint air defense and missile defense groups; setting of the direction of further cooperation in the area of missile defense," the Russian Defense Ministry said.

Meth Distributor Walter White Is Sentenced To 12 Years In Federal Prison Share
Tweet
Convicted methamphetamine distributor Walter White was sentenced yesterday to more than 12 years in prison, according to federal court records.
White, seen at right, was hit with the stiff sentence by Judge Don Molloy, before whom White entered guilty pleas in July to narcotics distribution and firearms charges.
Molloy also sentenced White, a Billings, Montana resident, to serve five years probation following his release from custody, and ordered him to forfeit $15,291 in cash and two .22-caliber handguns.
According to federal prosecutors, a Drug Enforcement Administration raid earlier this year of White's home turned up four ounces of methamphetamine. During questioning by federal agents, White reportedly copped to receiving up to two pounds of meth a week from one supplier.
White admitted that he “sold some of the methamphetamine and fronted some of the methamphetamine to others for distribution,” prosecutors reported in a court filing. He also confessed, investigators added, to accepting a firearm as payment for the drug.
One of the seized handguns--which White kept under his pillow--was, he explained, for “protection from other individuals involved in drug trafficking who may intend to rob or shoot him.”
Tigers owner Mike Ilitch has passed away at 87 years of age, Bill Shea of Crain's Detroit Business reports on Twitter. MLBTR extends its condolences to his family and friends, as well as the entire Tigers organization.
In a press release, his son Christopher — who is the president and CEO of Ilitch Holdings, Inc. — called his father “a once-in-a-generation entrepreneur, visionary and leader.” A son of Macedonian immigrants, the elder Ilitch was born and raised in Detroit. He went on to own two of the city's iconic sports franchises, the Tigers and the Red Wings of the NHL.
Ilitch spent five years in the U.S. Marine Corps after graduating from high school, and then joined the Tigers as an infielder. He ended up playing four seasons of minor-league ball before hanging up his spikes at 25 years of age. From there, according to the release, Ilitch worked as a door-to-door salesman to fund the opening of a pizza joint — the first Little Caesars.
After growing that small business into a massive, multi-national corporation, Ilitch expanded his business holdings. He bought the Red Wings in 1982, overseeing a golden era for that franchise, and took control of the Tigers in 1992.
While the hockey glories never quite carried over into the baseball arena, it wasn't for lack of trying. Ilitch's initial period of ownership was notable mostly for the Tigers' poor play, but things began to turn around after he developed Comerica Park in a public-private partnership in advance of the 2000 season.
The tide broke in 2006, when the Tigers finally reached the postseason for the first time since 1987, advancing to the World Series (where they lost to the Cardinals). Detroit posted winning campaigns in eight of the next eleven seasons, returning to the playoffs four more times. The club made it to the Fall Classic once more in 2012, but again came up short.
Over his later years, Ilitch spared no expense to put a quality product on the field. The Tigers routinely placed among the game's biggest spenders in player salaries, committing hundreds of millions of dollars annually to acquire and retain star-level talent.
Looking ahead for the Tigers organization, it seems that Christopher Ilitch will largely step into his father's shoes. While there are indications that the club will look to streamline its finances, the younger Ilitch has expressed a similar passion for fielding a winning team.
Attempts to solve the environmental crisis without challenging capitalism will fail — and the only force that can defeat capitalism is the working class.
by Stephanie McMillan
This is to specifically address class struggle as it relates to the ecological crisis. It will not address all the other (many!) reasons that working class struggle must be waged and supported.
First, we must recognize the fact that global capitalism is driving ecocide.
The problem reaches much farther back than capitalism itself. The combination of an early gendered division of labor with the adoption of agriculture and corresponding formation of permanent settlements set the stage for class divisions and the private accumulation of surplus wealth. Maintaining this arrangement required the development of states with armies, social oppression and repression to weaken internal opposition, and ideologies to make it all seem normal and pre-ordained. And as land was degraded and resources used up faster than they naturally replenished themselves, expansion became imperative, leading to conquest and forced unequal trade.
These intertwined and matured over time into an ever-more complex tangle, culminating in late-stage capitalism: the all-encompassing, all-devouring, spectacular horror that is our current global social living arrangement. The environmental crisis, specifically climate change, is the most urgent problem we collectively face. It is a simple fact that if our planet no longer supports life, then all human pursuits, including social justice, will also come to a screaming halt.
But attempts to solve the environmental crisis head-on, without addressing the underlying structural causes, will ultimately fail. Approaching it directly (for example by blocking a pipeline to prevent tar sands oil from reaching a refinery) can not overturn the socio-economic system that makes resource extraction a non-negotiable necessity. Capital is relentless, and will flow around any obstacle—or smash through it. Throughout history, it has demonstrated the willingness and capacity to wipe out anyone—including entire populations—who attempt to resist.
Historically only one class has been able to challenge capital and offer an alternative to it: the working class. This is not because of any sort of moral superiority, nor is it a matter of suffering the most. In fact, there are many others who are deprived of any means of survival altogether, which is an even worse situation than being exploited as a worker.
The reason that the working class has this capacity is that it is strategically placed. Workers have the most direct relationship with capital: they produce it. Even capitalists themselves merely manage and accumulate it, which they accomplish through the exploitation of workers in the production of commodities. Commodities embody surplus value in the form of unpaid labor, combined with natural materials (which capitalists simply claim ownership of through legal or other violent means). This surplus value, when it's realized as profit and re-invested, becomes new capital.
Capitalism runs on exploitation, by paying the aggregate of workers less than the total value of their products (the rest becomes profit). So in order to sell all the surplus commodities that can't be profitably consumed within a social formation, capitalism is structurally required to “expand or die.” The problem with this economic model on a finite planet is obvious.
The process is now at a stage where we face imminent catastrophe, unless we act decisively. Our collective strategy must be capable of smashing the entire global matrix of social relations—the economic, political, and ideological structures and practices (which all ultimately rest on the economic—the driving force is production).
Only if we free society from capitalism can there be any possible basis to re-organize human activity with different values in command, such as biocentrism and classless, mutual cooperation. Once we understand that the environment cannot be saved within the system's framework, that reforming or restraining it is impossible, then the question becomes: how do we end capitalism? How can we completely transform the way we live, so that the totality of human endeavor is no longer harnessed to the pursuit of private profit (through the production of surplus value)?
Capitalists will not voluntarily stop accumulating capital. They can't escape its structural imperatives any more than we can. Instead they are compelled to concentrate all their political might on crushing any and all threats to their hegemony. If we are to become capable of driving them from power, we need to organize ourselves into a massive, global social force. Our only two choices are omnicide or world revolution.
Many classes and social groups are dominated by capital and have an interest in ending it, and often a burning desire to do so. But most of them, even if they resist capital's effects extremely valiantly, will not be able to permanently defeat it. Historically, even after governments are overthrown, capitalism has either continued without interruption or been quickly restored. This is not a moral failing, but an inherent structural incapacity of the classes that have led these struggles–usually different fractions of the petit bourgeoisie (the “middle” classes). This flows from their own economic survival imperative under capitalism: the constant struggle to elevate their position in the marketplace. Thus they will insist on equality, “horizontalism” and fairness (marketplace values), but will always stop short of destroying the market itself.
This is why the majority in the environmental movement (who are mostly from the middle classes) refuse to cross that line of advocating the destruction of capitalism through revolution, and will vehemently deny (“You're going too far!”) the fact that it is the only way to save the planet.
The only class that is in fundamental conflict with capital is the working class. They face capital every day in an unresolvable antagonistic relationship of exploitation. Emancipating themselves entails stopping exploitation—wage slavery, the private appropriation (theft) of surplus value generated in commodity production—which means destroying the reproduction of capital altogether. By emancipating itself, the working class can free all other classes and the entire world from the grip of capitalism.
Capitalism can only be defeated through revolution led by the working class. This is why anyone (in all the dominated classes) concerned with saving the planet—or ending oppression and other horrors perpetrated and held in place by capitalism—must, in addition to weakening capital by resisting all its manifestations and effects, also take up, amplify, and support the struggles of the working class.

Is virtue — in the Greco-Roman sense of the term — the sort of thing that can be taught? Short answers: no, though it's complicated (Socrates). Yes, though it's tough (the Stoics). Since the idea that virtue can be learned is central to Stoic teachings, and since the Stoics very clearly thought themselves as the intellectual heirs of Socrates, the issue deserves some further discussion.
Luckily, I found a lively paper by Hugh Mercer Curtler at Southwest State University who presents a very accessible treatment of the issue of learning virtue, from which I will draw for the following notes. (The paper appeared in Humanitas in 1994, the full version is here.)
Curtler's starting point is, of course, Plato's Meno, in which the character by the same name asks: “Can you tell me, Socrates, is human excellence (areté) something teachable? Or, if not teachable, is it something to be acquired by training? Or, if it cannot be acquired either by training or by teaching, does it accrue to me at birth or in some other way?”
Socrates, after the usual lengthy discussion, concludes that virtue might be teachable in principle, but the fact that we don't find any teachers of it (clearly not the Sophists, regardless of their self-serving advertising!), then it must tentatively be concluded that the thing is likely not possible.
But Aristotle famously disagreed with Socrates (and Plato), distinguishing between moral and intellectual virtue. Moral virtue is a matter of habit and disposition, i.e., it develops via a combination of natural inclination and conditioning — and it lays the foundation for what we call character. Intellectual virtue, however, can be taught directly. Bear with me (and with Curtler) because this distinction will soon yield fruits.
Both Socrates and Plato had personal experience of the failure to teach moral virtue: the first one was clearly unable to influence his friend Alcibiades, one of the most fascinating figures of all Greek history; the second one almost lost his life in his attempt to educate the already vain and incorrigible Dionysius II of Syracuse.
(Let me open a parenthesis about Dionysius II. He is featured in a classic story referred to as Damocles' sword, which is somewhat relevant to the issue at hand. According to the story, which has arrived to us via Cicero, Damocles was flattering Dionysius, telling him how fortunate he was to be king. In order to teach him a lesson, the king invited Damocles to exchange place for a bit, a prospect that the latter eagerly embraced. But Dionysius had positioned a sword hanging right over the throne, secured only by a single hair from a horse's tail. Damocles was then in constant fear of being suddenly killed. Apparently, he didn't like the feeling, so he declined to be king any further, and was taught a good lesson on what it is like to live like a powerful man.
Interestingly, Cicero uses this story — in Tusculanae Disputationes V.21 — to conclude that virtue is the only thing needed for happiness, rhetorically asking: “Does not Dionysius seems to have made it sufficiently clear that there can be nothing happy for the person over whom some fear always looms?” Needless to say, Cicero's conclusion is a very Stoic one, despite his sympathies for the Academics.)
Back to teaching (or not) virtue. Curtler correctly points out that modern psychology pretty much agrees with Aristotle: moral character is essentially formed by the time children begin formal schooling, or shortly thereafter, and it is likely a result of genetic, early developmental, and early environmental (including from family and siblings) influences. This would seem to lead to the conclusion that the notion of teaching virtue in school is a misguided one, in broad agreement with Socrates and against the Stoics. But wait, there is more.
In the second book of the Nicomachean Ethics Aristotle says that the way to shape a young character is to make sure the person forms the right habits early on, essentially suggesting something like positive and negative reinforcement. As Plato puts it: moral education largely consists in making sure that the young person “find(s) pleasure or pain in the right things.” Curtler observes: “Aristotle is here recognizing the important psychological fact that unless a person wants to be a good person — that is, unless he or she takes pleasure in right actions — he or she will not be one.”
(Please note that “pleasure” here is not the concept advanced by the Epicureans, since it is not natural, but the result of education.)
We are now ready for the transition from moral to intellectual virtue. While the basic structure of one's character is laid out early on, one still grows up and begins to use reason to navigate complex moral situations, situations for which genetics and early conditioning by themselves simply do not prepare us. There will then be a gradual transition from moral to intellectual virtue, resulting in practical wisdom, one of the four cardinal Stoic virtues.
Notice, of course, that we are now not far from the Stoic concept of oikeiosis, the process of familiarization or appropriation by which one develops a concern for others, mentioned by the Neoplatonist Porphyry: “those who followed Zeno stated that oikeiôsis is the beginning of justice.”
More generally, the Stoics subscribed to a developmental theory of virtue, which seems very much to combine Aristotle's early moral virtue with his mature intellectual virtue to shape a wholesome adult human being.
Curtler then observes that while moral virtue is simply not the right focus for formal education (because it's too late already), intellectual virtue is, and that is the sort of thing that the humanities (philosophy, of course, but also history, literature, etc.) — at their best — are supposed to teach: “there is little point whatever [in formal education] if our goal is to reform character, whereas these subjects can be extremely important ways to refine character … By reading literature the young person lives vicariously and grows in human sensibility; by studying history, the horizons of that person's experience are extended and his or her sympathies are deepened; by studying philosophy the student discovers seminal ideas, analytical skills are sharpened and the student learns the difference between reasonable and unreasonable claims.”
Curtler gives the example of a course in business ethics: “[it] will not make an undergraduate business major an honest employee when she goes to work after graduation. But it will sharpen her analytical skills and make her aware of the subtleties of rationalization and wary of sophistry.”
Indeed, Curtler turns the table against the critics of education, suggesting that when they complain that education does not make people better persons they are confusing moral and intellectual virtue.
The same criticism could be raised against Socrates' pessimism (or Plato's initial optimism about Dionysius II): in answering Meno he was thinking about moral virtue, and he is right that one cannot find formal teachers of it. But that only exhausts one dimension of virtue, and the other one can very much be affected by teachers, or by laudable examples about whom we read in literature and philosophy classes. Like the life and death of Socrates.

David Mundell, secretary of state for Scotland, has given his backing to a campaign to have LGBT+ issues added to the curriculum and taught in schools
The first openly gay Tory cabinet minister has backed a call for LGBT+ issues to be taught in Scottish schools.
Secretary of state for Scotland, David Mundell, gave his backing to the Time for Inclusive Education (TIE), saying that while he had the support of his family and colleagues when he came out in January this year, he is aware that many school pupils still face homophobic bullying on a daily basis.
Mundell is the latest politician to back the proposal which TIE says will go a long way to tackling high rates of bullying among LGBT+ youth.
Many LGBTI young people still face homophobia and bullying on a daily basis
Just last month, TIE published a report last month which found that 90% of LGBT+ people experience homophobia while at school, and 27% reported that they had attempted suicide once due to being bullied.
Speaking today, Mundell said: “Because of the support I had from family, friends and colleagues, coming out as a gay man has been an incredibly positive experience for me. But many LGBTI young people still face homophobia and bullying on a daily basis.
“This is not acceptable and cannot be ignored. That is why I am supporting the TIE campaign - to tackle prejudice and spread understanding in our schools, giving LGBTI young people equality and respect, which is their right.”
A TIE spokesperson said: "We are delighted that David Mundell has supported our campaign, and has joined us in calling for an end to homophobia, biphobia and transphobia in schools.
“His endorsement is significant as, while we are a Scottish campaign, we know that the issues facing LGBTI young people within education are universal.
“David is the first UK minister to back our proposals, and we are keen to work closely with the Scotland Office as we move to address these issues at a nationwide level.”
Campaigners from TIE recently met with education secretary John Swinney and provided him with their proposals for LGBT+ issues, such as same-sex families and the history of the LGBT+ rights movement, to be included in curricular guidance and for teachers to be trained on how to address the topic in the classroom.
However, the Scottish Government has faced criticism from Holyrood opposition benches for its lack of movement since then, with Conservative MSP Annie Wells accusing First Minister Nicola Sturgeon of paying “lip service” to the campaign during a recent chamber debate.
Last month, TIE took its case to the equalities and human rights committee of the Scottish Parliament, where it expressed concerns over the Scottish Government's current approach to tackling homophobia in schools.
Afterwards, Swinney wrote to the committee and agreed to delay the publication to allow time for more discussions on it.

(ANTIMEDIA) — The exponential rise in the value of bitcoin over the last seven years is one of the big stories of the decade. At its peak last week, it was up over 500% since July of this year. But its overall surge is even more stratospheric. One hundred dollars worth of bitcoin mined or bought at the beginning of this decade would be worth tens or even hundreds of millions today. Needless to say, many people are kicking themselves for not having invested early. And for those unfortunate souls who had bitcoin and lost it, there may be no end to the anguish.
One of these people is James Howells, an IT worker living in the United Kingdom who lost 7,500 bitcoins that he mined on his personal laptop in 2009. Adding more salt to the wound, James (who is in his early thirties) knows where the Bitcoin is — buried in a landfill in Newport, South Wales.
As he explains to the Telegraph, James was one of the first bitcoin miners and stored the fruit of his algorithmic labors on the hard drive of a Dell laptop, which he accidentally threw away. “After I had stopped mining, the laptop I had used was broken into parts and sold on eBay,” James recounts.
Now James wants to go looking for the hard drive — which contains around $127 million worth of bitcoin — underneath four years' worth of garbage.
“A modern landfill is a complex engineering project and digging one up brings all sorts of environmental issues, such as dangerous gases and potential landfill fires,” he admits. “It's a big, expensive and risky project.”
And it may not even be possible, as the city council does not seem willing to undertake the endeavor despite Howells' offer to cover the expenses of the specialty equipment that would be needed. A spokesman for the Newport City Council says that such a project could cause harm to the surrounding environment and is unlikely to find the hard drive, much less in working condition.
“It is likely that the hardware would have suffered significant galvanic corrosion due to the presence of landfill leachates and gases.”
Nevertheless, Howells isn't giving up hope and has offered to give city council members a percentage of the recovered bitcoin, the value of which could continue rising in the coming years. Tech mogul John McAfee recently doubled down on his original bullish prediction, saying he believes bitcoin will hit $1 million by 2020. If that valuation transpires, Howells' landfill bitcoin would be worth billions. Maybe that would be enough to convince the city council to grab a shovel.
In the meantime, James Howells continues to invest in other cryptocurrencies and real estate. One has to imagine, though, that from to time he daydreams about digging through 350,000 tons of garbage.

Isn't it clearer every day that the real alternative to the violence of our world is none other than love? The Clintons have not learned that lesson from Mother Teresa.
It's hard to overstate the symbolic power of sitting down. Today, a football player's refusal to stand for the National Anthem has garnered headline upon headline. Twenty-two years ago, a seated couple protested one of the world's most beloved figures.
In a truly iconic American scene that still captures the attention—and confusion—of the Washington elite, then-President Bill Clinton and his wife, Hillary, sat in stunned silence amid a standing ovation that followed Mother Teresa's address at the National Prayer Breakfast.
The applause lasted a solid five minutes after Mother Teresa's address. Long before the days of “virtue-signaling,” however, the Clintons were sending a message of dissent loud and clear to the woman now officially canonized a saint in the Catholic Church for her “heroic virtue.”
Abortion, the Destroyer of Love
The Clintons' seated dissent had everything to do with Mother Teresa's courageous stand for the sanctity of life, which echoed her earlier comments in her 1979 Nobel Peace Prize acceptance speech.
“Any country that accepts abortion is not teaching its people to love, but to use any violence to get what they want,” she said. “This is why the greatest destroyer of love and peace is abortion.”
Instead of offering a violent “solution,” Mother Teresa urged her listeners to help mothers and fathers learn to love their babies, to start within their own families in their care for the unwanted and weak, then to move into the community and into the world. To love until it hurts. Isn't it clearer every day that the real alternative to the violence of our world today is none other than love?
The Clintons have not learned that lesson from Mother Teresa. In fact, Hillary's Democrats promote the most rabidly pro-abortion platform our nation has ever seen. In addition to forcing the American taxpayer to fund abortions at home through promising to repeal the Hyde Amendment, the Democratic Party's platform would also force us to pay for abortions overseas by repealing the Helms Amendment.
Beyond Virtue Signaling
Tragic as it is to see many in our culture roundly rejecting Mother Teresa's words, we are the living beneficiaries of her legacy—which placed an inestimable value on every human life and went well beyond courageous words and virtue signaling.
About 3,000 neighborhood-based pregnancy help organizations, including pregnancy centers, medical clinics, maternity homes, nonprofit adoption agencies, and maternity support programs in all 50 states provide love and support, “until it hurts,” to more than a million people every year who are in the throes of an unexpected pregnancy. With shoestring staffs and budgets, community-funded nonprofits make up one of the greatest humanitarian movements in modern times.
Every woman deserves the love and support she needs to have a healthy baby. Life-affirming pregnancy help exists to replace the fear, abandonment, and even coercion that often drive her to abortion with love. It's through this kind of irreplaceable help a mother can follow her God-given instinct to love and protect her own baby.
As Mother Teresa acknowledged, the problems facing the poor among us are daunting in their complexity. Our solution to these challenges must always include reducing our aims to simple steps—the steps of active love we can provide within our families, our neighborhoods, and our society.
Mother Teresa reminds us so well of our call toward the individual in front of us, who bears the very image of God. We don't focus on “problems,” but on individual lives, one by one, as we offer love and personal involvement in their lives.
“Ek, ek, ek,”—“one, one, one” in Hindi—is the way Mother Teresa often described her approach. One person at a time: one family, one neighborhood, one step followed by another. Every one of those steps led by the Lord.
Not everyone will stand with us. But with or without their support, we must stand, as Mother Teresa did, with those who need us most.
Image caption Privately educated Nick D'Aloisio sold his app to Yahoo for millions of pounds
Teenager Nick D'Aloisio hit the headlines last month when an app he had developed was bought by Yahoo for millions of pounds.
I interviewed Nick 13 months ago at his home in Wimbledon in south London and it was obvious he came from a successful, wealthy family who had opted to give him a private education.
A day after Nick started counting his millions, an email dropped in my inbox about another teenaged developer.
Schoolboy Tom Humphrey has launched an app designed to help language learning by combining dictionary definitions with digital translation tools. He also happens to go to Eton College.
Meanwhile teenager Nina Dewani, who was interviewed by the BBC last month after designing a password-prompting app, attends a private school in St Albans.
It could be a coincidence, but these young people join a long line of tech entrepreneurs who attended private schools and found fame for their creations.
Sir Tim Berners-Lee went to an independent school, as did Bill Gates (although he later dropped out of Harvard to set up a software company), while child prodigy Mark Zuckerberg had a tutor who helped him start writing software.
Image caption Tom Humphrey designed a winning app
It is from public schools such as Eton that the current prime minister and many leaders of industry have emerged so it should perhaps come as no great surprise that the entrepreneurs of the future are also learning there.
Tom thinks his winning app design was down to him as an individual rather than the famous school he goes to but he acknowledged that it played a part.
"The school didn't push me to enter the competition but once I had entered they helped me. There are brilliant facilities here," he said.
"If you show interest in something, there are people that are going to help you. The school gave me the freedom to develop the app," he added.
Mark McGinn, who organised the O2 Think Big AppSkool competition that Tom won, thinks the 17-year-old succeeded on his own merits but recognises that school can play an important role.
"There is no doubt that private schools offer the opportunity to touch success and inspire a certain mindset and a willingness to take risks," he said.
"The horizon at these schools is just bigger. If you are fortunate enough to be in a classroom where some of the parents are heads of industry you are going to be inspired," he added.
'Losing talent'
At 15:30 when the bell goes in a state school, the kids are out of the door. Very few are staying behind doing innovative things Tony Sewell, Founder Generating Genius
It is an issue that Dr Tony Sewell, founder of Generating Genius, is determined to tackle.
He set up the charity with the specific intention of getting children from disadvantaged backgrounds into universities to study the Stem subjects of Science, Technology, Engineering and Maths.
"Public schoolboys dominate sports, arts and the technology section," Dr Sewell told the BBC.
"Private schools have a culture of independent thinking, they give students a sense that they are knowledgeable and confident. In comprehensives it is the reverse - to be ignorant is to be the star," he added.
The fact that few children from disadvantaged backgrounds take up Stem subjects at university is something that needs urgent focus.
"It is something that state schools need to address. We are losing talent."
Partly the issue is a cultural one, he thinks.
While a child perceived as a "geek" at a state comprehensive may be bullied, he says, in a private school that child is more likely to be nurtured and encouraged.
"The culture of competition is at the heart of the public school as are clubs and societies," said Dr Sewell.
"At 15:30 when the bell goes in a state school, the kids are out of the door. Very few are staying behind doing innovative things," he says.
Democratisation
At a recent competition for schools to come up with clever uses for the Raspberry Pi - the ultra-cheap micro-controller - there was a dearth of entries from state schools.
It was something that worried the judges, including the BBC's own technology correspondent, Rory Cellan-Jones.
"One theory offered as to why was that the constraints of the curriculum meant teachers were too cautious about committing to time-consuming projects which might not contribute directly to exam results," he said.
Prof Stephen Heppell, an education expert determined to transform the curriculum, agrees.
"Schools need to get away from half-hour lesson blocks especially with computer science," he said.
"No sooner have you got started than it is time to stop. To write a good program you need a good block of time, half a day at least."
Image caption The Raspberry Pi is cheap enough for anyone to buy
He is convinced there is no shortage of talent in the state sector and, if most of the app developers making the headlines at the moment come from fee-paying schools, it might just be down to their parents.
"They may have the money to spend on getting the app to market or getting marketing for it," he said.
The nature of entrepreneurship is such that someone with a good idea and enough determination can become successful whatever their background.
And with tools such as the Raspberry Pi available to all, technology is certainly not the preserve of schools such as Eton.
Programming too has become easier, meaning the teenage app developer is here to stay, says Prof Heppell.
"What is scarce now isn't so much programming skills but good ideas and kids are awash with good ideas."
And he says some of the best are likely to come from children at state schools: "They have better ideas because they have a better sense of what the world needs."
A fundraising committee that raised more than a quarter-million dollars targeting supporters of Bernie Sanders Bernard (Bernie) SandersPush to end U.S. support for Saudi war hits Senate setback Sanders: 'I fully expect' fair treatment by DNC in 2020 after 'not quite even handed' 2016 primary Sanders: 'Damn right' I'll make the large corporations pay 'fair share of taxes' MORE has apparently spent little on the election activities it boasted it would.
The Socially Responsible Government PAC — which initially registered under the name “Feel Bern PAC” and has a website with pro-Sanders content — raised more than $260,000 in the first three months of 2016, according to Federal Election Commission (FEC) records.
ADVERTISEMENT
More than 80 percent of the $199,116 spent by the PAC went to six individuals associated with the group, online marketing and advertising costs, audience targeting firms and transfers to limited liability companies (LLCs) that were formed only months ago, according to a review by The Hill. Four individuals only received one payment, while founder Kyle Prall and the PAC's treasurer collectively took in $26,000 in the first quarter.
Prall did not return calls from The Hill for comment. A phone number on FEC forms for the PAC's treasurer belongs to a Texas business that said it had no record of the individual.
The Socially Responsible Government PAC spent $3,101 during a visit to the Florida nightclub E11even Miami on Feb. 29 and, days earlier, spent a total of $1,167 at The Palms hotel and casino in Las Vegas. E11even Miami bills itself as an "immersive adventure encompassing the luxury and sophistication of a one-of-a-kind Ultraclub," with DJs, aerialists, go-go dancers and "exotic acts."
The purpose of the spending in Las Vegas and Miami is unclear, though federal election rules prohibiting the personal use of campaign funds do not cover PACs not run by a candidate or party.
The PAC, which ended March with almost $76,000 in the bank, did make a $1,000 donation to the Democratic National Committee and a $500 donation to VoteRiders, a non-profit focused on election turnout.
There is also nearly $15,000 in payments wired to unknown vendors through Upwork, a company that connects vendors to freelancers offering services from web developing, creative design and writing to accounting and consulting. There is not additional detail about what the contractors did.
When the PAC formed on Christmas Day, the committee was called the Feel Bern PAC — a shortened version of the “Feel the Bern” slogan co-opted by the Sanders campaign. It is against federal rules to use a candidate's name in unaffiliated fundraising vehicles, so the PAC in March changed its name to Socially Responsible Government.
The sleek website for the PAC promises to help Sanders get elected and has embedded videos from the senator's presidential campaign and logos that appear similar to his campaign's. It is organized like a traditional campaign page, with tabs for issues, initiatives and how to volunteer.
“All it takes is a small donation from everyone, and we will be more powerful than the 1%,” the PAC's home page reads under a large “Our Mission” banner. “Donate today to support Bernie Sanders' campaign to put the power back into the hands of the people.”
A large, red “Donate” button is juxtaposed next to a photo of Sanders.
The PAC's website, at FeelBern.org, is different than another pro-Sanders website, FeeltheBern.org, that does not solicit any donations.
The website says donations will be used for supporting online, television and radio advertisements, phone and door-knocking drives and get-out-the-vote efforts that include helping people obtain voter IDs and driving people to the polls.
“This private political organization is not to be confused with Bernie Sander's [sic] Official campaign,” a disclaimer at the bottom of the site reads.
The Sanders campaign sent a cease and desist notice to the PAC on Dec. 11 asking that the website change its design, according to documents obtained by The Hill.
"While Bernie 2016 is grateful for your enthusiasm, we are compelled to inform you that current efforts are illegal and are causing harmful confusion for supporters of Senator Sanders' campaign," the letter reads, citing violations of intellectual property and trademarks.
The PAC appears, however, to have tapped into the small-dollar fundraising fervor that Sanders created.
From December through March, the PAC collected $261,213, with more than $190,000 coming in checks of amounts of less than $250. Roughly 150 people gave $250 or more, and 18 contributed $1,000 or more.
Seth Gunning, an Atlanta resident who donated to Sanders's presidential campaign, said he decided to look into the PAC after being targeted by a Facebook advertisement.
Gunning has now filed a complaint to the FEC alleging that the PAC has fraudulently solicited funds and misused its resources.
“The content of the advertisements purchased by the PAC (under the name ‘Feel the Bern') are solely to generate additional contributions to the PAC rather than to support any candidate or educate an audience on a particular issue,” Gunning wrote in his complaint to the FEC, which he shared with The Hill. The ads, he says, use images of Sanders and similar branding to Sanders's presidential campaign and have language such as "Donate to Our Campaign."
From January to March, more than $66,000 was spent on ads placed on Google and Facebook and on firms that specialize in targeting audiences and obtaining page views.
The Socially Responsible Government PAC also paid three LLCs — LCGM, NHT Productions and DMF Marketing Solutions — more than $62,000 in marketing or advertising services, according to FEC records. The LLCs began receiving payments from the PAC anywhere between one and four weeks after they had been incorporated, a review of records by The Hill shows.
Joe Centrich, a member of Texas law firm Clausen & Centrich, incorporated DMF Marketing Solutions LLC and NHT Productions LLC. LCGM and NHT Productions have the same mailing address, a Michigan post office box, according to state regulatory filings.
Centrich has worked as an attorney for Prall but told The Hill that he has no involvement with the PAC and does not work in campaign finance law. Centrich said he has no financial interest in the LLCs and was only paid the fees and costs associated with setting them up.
Citing attorney-client privilege, Centrich said he could not say who asked him to set up the LLCs but said that his work on the matter is over.
Socially Responsible Government is set up as a hybrid PAC, which allows it to have a separate bank account where donors can send checks of unlimited amounts.
Prall, who lives in Texas, has also started HC4President, a super-PAC with a similar website that backs Hillary Clinton Hillary Diane Rodham ClintonSanders: 'I fully expect' fair treatment by DNC in 2020 after 'not quite even handed' 2016 primary Sanders: 'Damn right' I'll make the large corporations pay 'fair share of taxes' Former Sanders campaign spokesman: Clinton staff are 'biggest a--holes in American politics' MORE. That effort, created on Jan. 18, collected $1,482 in the first quarter.
Prall has faced controversy in the past over two websites he founded, BustedMugshots.com and Mugshotsonline.com.
The sites culled mugshots from public records and displayed them prominently in search engine results. When the photographed individuals asked to have the pictures taken down, the site allegedly charged them hundreds of dollars, according to media reports.
The company behind the sites, Citizens Information Associates, ended or settled a series of lawsuits, according to Centrich and media reports.

It's January. A magical time when all you need is a keyboard and an imagination to send the soccer world into a frenzy.
Messi to Chelsea? Why not! Ronaldo to Malmo? Never say never!
Fire fans know the transfer window merry-go-round all too well. Whether it is Jermaine Jones being poached at the last second or Didier Drogba Frenching his way to the Frenchiest MLS franchise because he would just be too uncomfortable for a few months in a world-class city like Chicago with his millions of dollars if he couldn't get some authentic crepes. (Look, I have a keyboard and an imagination too. That's my theory, I'm sticking to it.)
And it wouldn't be a proper transfer window if the Fire was not linked to some big names that are likely unattainable. Rumors of Carlos Vela briefly surfaced before dying down just to get things started and then Nemanja Vidic rumors put the "big name to Chicago" machine in overdrive.
But it appears Vidic will go the way of Jones and Drogba. It seemed like there was enough there for it to be true. Vidic is Serbian like the new coach Veljko Paunovic, he needed a promise of playing time after his Serie A debacle and his name starts with Vi just like Vincent, Nelson Rodriguez's favorite name.
However, Vidic always preferred a return to the Premier League and with Aston Villa in the mix, it is very likely his little desire to come to MLS is all but gone. Of course anything is still possible, but Vidic signing is now highly improbable.
So let's take a look at the rumors that make the most sense and are most probable in order of likelihood.
1. Joao Meira - center back from Portugal
Meira reportedly told Portuguese outlet Record that he has been offered a two-year deal with the Chicago Fire. I don't know why he would make up a rumor about going to MLS and why he would choose the Fire, so it is likely true. He also fits the bill for what Rodriguez's stated plan, which is bringing in three European center backs. Ideally, a player like Meira would be No. 3 in that pecking order. He has experience in Portugal's top flight, but he was dropped by his most recent club, Belenenses, and has a failed drug test on his resume.
At 28 years old, he is probably worth the gamble and should get his opportunity. But the signing would not scream no-doubt-about-it starter.
2. Haris Medunjanin - midfielder with Deportivo La Coruna
This rumor comes courtesy of Spanish sports site Marca. According to the report, Medunjanin's La Liga club REALLY wants to get rid of him. The manager has kept him out of recent competitions and the club is focused on unloading Medunjanin's contract. This signing would also fit with Rodrgiuez's vision, which included bringing in some international experience to the midfield. I think it would be a great fit.
The Fire's midfield is build on potential with only Harry Shipp and Matt Polster as sure starters. David Accam could play in the midfield, but if Paunovic opts for a 4-4-2, Accam could also play at forward. Either way, the team desperately needs a steady presence. With the loss of Razvan Cocis, the Fire would rely on Michael Stephens, Collin Fernandez and Kingsley Bryce. I think it would be great for all those players to get time and develop, but the team also needs someone it can count on to be steady, not spectacular.
Cocis filled that role last season and now Medunjanin could be an upgrade. He has been a solid player in European leagues and plays with the Bosnia and Herzegovina national team. Medunjanin contributed to the team's 2014 World Cup run as well. He has 43 goals in 269 career appearances. The Fire could face competition for his signature from Maccabi Tel Aviv, for whom Medunjanin previously played.
3. Marcin Kaminski - center back with Lech Poznan
This is no longer even a rumor as Rodriguez confirmed to the Sun Times that the club has had discussions with the 24-year-old center back. This would be a major coup for the Fire as Kaminski is a young, sought after center back that has already helped his team win the domestic league, qualify for Champions League play and appear in Euro qualifiers with the Poland national team.
Kaminski would immediately be the best center back on the team and could be a core piece for year's to come because of his youth. But I fear this could be the most difficult signing for the club to make.
Rodriguez has said multiple times the team is competing with Champions League clubs for signings and some of the Fire's targets are waiting out the process to see what offers might come. I don't think it is a stretch to say Kaminski is likely the player waiting out the transfer window to see what other offers might come his way. It is very possible at the end of the day the Fire will not have enough to compete with a bigger, European based club.
Any other rumors of note? Who would you like to see join the club?
Aaron Webber Confirms Sonic Forces & Archie News Coming Later This Week by SSF1991 July 18, 2017
The more we hear about San Diego Comic Con, the more important it looks to be for news.
Not only is it looking like Sonic Mania news will be happening, but Sonic Forces and even Archie Sonic news is coming later this week. The former was confirmed on Twitter and the latter was confirmed on the Sonic PR live stream (the topic is brought up roughly 16:30 into the stream).
As for the latter, they specifically say “the silence will be broken soon”, and thanked people for their patience. It was a question they have been getting from fans a lot lately, so it was the “elephant in the room” pre-SDCC.

Last month nine startups joined our new Startupbootcamp IoT | Connected Devices program for three months of acceleration (more on each of our teams here). We're only four weeks in, but a lot of work has already been done on product market fit, customer development, and getting ready for manufacturing. Here's a look at what's been going on…
‘Nervous', ‘Excited', ‘Scared'… How are our startups feeling about the next three months?
Workshops
We've run a number of sessions around some of the key stages of building a startup, such as business model design and customer development…
Given that our startups are all developing a piece of hardware there has also been a lot of focus on areas such as the bill of materials, wireless options that can be used in an IoT device, and getting ready for manufacturing. Here's a brief intro to the latter…
Partners, Mentors & Events
Our startups have had the chance to speak with both our program and global partners such as Cisco, RPD, Intel and Amazon…
Great to have @JoshValman from our partners at @RPDintl with us today talking to our teams… pic.twitter.com/XViYs77zh6 — Sbootcamp IoT | CD (@sbcIoT_Devices) October 20, 2016
They've been paired with a handful of expert mentors who will be helping them over the coming months…

While prosecuting the wrongdoers is clearly not part of the new normal (see Sokol et al.), what Nanex found this morning beggars belief - both in its method of manipulation and clarity that our regulators are clueless. As they note, the high frequency traders (HFT) are at it again. Contorting the spirit of the rules, because those who wrote the rules aren't technically savvy. On January 4, 2013, we found another instance of HFT morphing their manipulative and illegal quote stuffing strategy in an effort to fly under the radar. Why they don't just stop this manipulative practice altogether tells us a few things. First, this isn't some coding error, this is sophisticated cheating. And second, because they are spending valuable programming time on this strategy, there must be some real economic advantage. Which mean a disadvantage to everyone trading against them.
Via Nanex, Seconds In a Microsecond World,
The Strategy
Each exchange has been setting limits for the number of canceled orders allowed per second. We know that one exchange has a limit of 300 canceled orders per second per stock.. It's rare to find 300 or more canceled orders in one stock in any one second from that exchange. But you will find tens of thousands of seconds where a stock has 299 canceled orders.
In the charts below, we show a new strategy they have cooked up: send a blast of orders (all immediately canceled) over a very short period of time, 100 milliseconds (ms) in this case, and then silence for the balance of the second. They know that exchanges measure the number of canceled orders on a per-second basis, so that blast of orders sent in 100ms will be diluted by another 900ms of silence. But networks operate on a much smaller time-scale, microseconds. A microsecond is a millionth of a second.
If an exchange sets a limit of 1000 canceled orders per second, these nefarious HFT will blast a 1000 orders in 100 milliseconds (ms), followed by silence for the balance of the second. The exchange will only see 1000 orders in a second, which is at the limit, so no problem. But the network that carries those orders to other participants won't see it that way.
A network that can carry 1000 orders in a second, can carry only 1 order per millisecond (1/1000th of a second) before latency (delay) occurs. Which means blasting 1000 orders in 100ms will begin overloading the network and causing delays after just the first 100 messages. Which means 900 messages will arrive late to other traders (competitors) computers. Which is the whole point of this high technology warfare.

Cathrineholm of Norway Enamelware – Lotus Pattern I found a Cathrineholm of Norway, white on blue, tea kettle with the lotus pattern a few years ago at an antique store for $10. I vaguely remembered it as a pattern seen during my childhood, but I also knew at the time it was fetching quite high prices by collectors on ebay. Regrettably (now) I sold that teakettle on ebay for a tidy sum, x15 what I paid. The only upside was I sold it to a lady in Norway and I liked the idea of the piece going back to its home turf. I adored the teakettle and was torn about selling it, but at the time thought I don't drink tea, it's the only piece I own, it seems quite expensive to buy off ebay, so I might as well just sell it and get some money to buy something I do collect. A few weeks later my boyfriend went to an estate sale and dug up a small Cathrineholm (CH) red on white lotus pattern 4 inch bowl. He woke me up that Saturday morning by presenting it to me and from that moment on I was hooked. I had never seen or handled one of the bowls and was amazed at the quality. I didn't realize the bowls were enamelware too, in fact almost everything produced with the lotus pattern is enamelware, and something about substance and durability of them being glass over metal really captivated me. It probably has something to do with living in such a plastic filled world, holding something made to last – and made to last a long time – holds a lot of appeal for me.
So from that morning on I started to collect Cathrineholm and I have learned a good deal about the company as a result. The company was founded in 1907 and closed in 1968. One of their most famous designers was Grete Prytz Kittelsen (born 1917 in Oslo, Norway, died 2010) but contrary to what you will read many places Grete did not design the Lotus Pattern, though she probably was responsible for the shape and bodies of the pieces the lotus pattern appears on. Grete created many pieces for Cathrineholm but she favored a more minimalist look, using solid primary colors contrasted by exposed metal. But she did not much care for the lotus pattern when it was introduced. In reality the lotus pattern was created by Arne Clausen, a decorator working at Cathrineholm in the 1960's. Legend has it a series of designs was tested marketed among some Norwegian housewives and they overwhelmingly favored the Lotus pattern enamelware so into production it went and it became a signature line of Cathrineholm. The pieces come in a variety of forms, from plates, to bowls, to cookware, to canisters to fondue sets. Strangely the large kitchen canisters (for coffee, flour, sugar, etc..) and spice rack canisters were not produced by the Cathrineholm factory in Norway. The canisters were produced in Japan and are made of aluminum. I think CH contracted out these pieces to a company in Japan to save costs and maybe because enamelware was not suited well to storage canisters. I'm not sure of all the details yet but I own a set of the large canisters and I'm doing more research into the subject. I'm only aware of the Japanese origin due to some of the canisters retaining a “Japan” sticker and the fact they are made of aluminum makes them stand apart from the enamelware line.
The salt and pepper shakers with the lotus pattern are extremely rare and there are two types and I'm not sure either were produced at the CH factory either. One type is a almost lotus/bullet shaped shaker with a small lotus pattern at the bottom and the top being a long, slender chrome triangle. Another Norwegian company produced the exact same shakers, only without the lotus pattern, so I'm thinking CH may have just contracted with them to produce some with the lotus pattern but I'm still trying to confirm this. But of the two types, these are the most likely to be from the CH factory and are the hardest to find.
The other shaker looks much like the spice canister, only with the holes at the top as shaker instead of a lid, and were produced in Japan. I'm thinking the Norwegian bullet shaped shakers came first and then later on when they contracted with the Japanese company to do the canisters they went ahead and made shakers too. There are several weird little issues with Cathrineholm lotus pieces. Some pieces are marked with the Cathrineholm logo on the bottom, some are not. Different logos are used on various pieces. I hope to try and figure out the timeline involved with the marks, if they were marked early on in production or later. The fact American company started producing a series of plastic bowls that imitated the lotus pattern may have spurred Cathrineholm to start marking their pieces, but this is just my theory so far.
The lotus pattern pieces are usually brightly colored, but were later available in the more earthy tones that were coming into vogue as the 1970's drew near. (Remember the three standard kitchen colors used on appliances in the 1970s – avocado, gold and rust?) . Mostly the lotus pattern pieces are white/contrasted with a color – as in a white lotus pattern on blue background or blue lotus pattern on a white background but there were some pieces made that used color on color, such as a deep blue lotus pattern on a light blue background. The colors I'm aware of that were produced are as follows, contrasted with white unless otherwise noted: Bright Orange Green Bright Yellow Wheat Yellow Red Navy Blue Sky Blue Pink Black Sage Rust / Brown Sky Blue on Pastel Blue Green on pastel lime green From my experience the rarest color, or hardest to find color for cathrineholm lotus pattern, is pink. True red is also a difficult to find color. Many people sometimes mistake the bright orange used by CH as “red” but it is not and orange is one of the more common and popular colors. The Cathrineholm bowls came in a variety of sizes, six in all, and were made to nest into each other for storage. The smallest bowl is mere 3 inches and seems to be for dips or sauces. The largest bowl is a whopping 11 inches. The exact measurements for all the lotus bowls in from smallest to largest in order are 3-7/8″, 5-1/2″, 7-1/8″, 7-7/8″, 9-1/2″, 11″
I'll be posting more photos in the next several days of the different pieces available in the line but you get a pretty good idea from the top photo that shows many pieces displayed on the shelves. The pieces not shown in the photo are some of the cookware pans such a saute pans, double boilers, skillets, baking/lasanga pan of which I have examples of to post later if I get around to it. One very neat little aspect of the pots and pans is the lids acting a trivet for serving.
2016 Update: Well, I've moved into a new (mid century modern) home with a much larger kitchen so my display of Cathrineholm pieces has drastically changed. Since the kitchen is wrap around and large it's hard to capture it in a photo, but here is one section where I have a lot grouped together (along with some Jen Quistgaard enamelware pieces for Dansk). I've also been able to use the tops of my cabinets all around my kitchen to display all of my CH cookware, much of which had been tucked away in cabinets until the move. The white kitchen cabinets and countertops compliment the lotus pattern and bold colors perfectly.

Kosovo police have used tear gas to disperse protesters objecting to arrest warrants issued for opposition MPs.
Police tried to arrest opposition MP Albin Kurti, who has led a series of protests in parliament against agreements made with Serbia.
Mr Kurti was reportedly not at home when masked police entered his flat in the capital Pristina on Wednesday.
Another opposition MP, Donika Kadaj-Bujupi, was arrested for letting off tear gas in parliament.
Scores of opposition supporters gathered in front of the government headquarters in downtown Pristina for a second day, throwing stones and paint at the building.
Police arrested at least 13 protesters, the AFP news agency reported.
A grenade also went off outside the constitutional court in Pristina as the raid on Mr Kurti's flat took place.
But there was no confirmation that the explosion, described by police as "controlled", was connected.
For weeks, Mr Kurti, a former leader of the Self-Determination Party, has spearheaded opposition to a deal with Serbia, mediated by the EU in August, that hands greater autonomy to Kosovo's ethnic Serb minority.

The opposition also objects to a border demarcation deal with Montenegro that it says hands Kosovan territory to its neighbour.
Police spokesperson Baki Kelani told reporters on Wednesday that they were "acting upon four detention warrants from the public prosecutor for four MPs".
He said one - Ms Kadaj-Bujupi - had been detained "while we are still looking for three others".
Kosovo, which has an ethnic Albanian majority, declared independence from Serbia in 2008 but has never been recognised by the Belgrade government.
The split came a decade after a conflict between Serb forces and Kosovan Albanian rebels. A Nato bombing campaign against Belgrade in effect forced Serbia to cede the state.
The constitutional court in Pristina last week suspended for two months the government's deal providing greater power to Serb-run municipalities pending a review. But the opposition sees the court as too close to the government.
Seven people, most of them police, were hurt during protests outside the Kosovo parliament on Tuesday. Petrol bombs and stones were thrown outside the building as pepper spray and tear gas were sprayed inside the chamber.
The violence broke out as King Abdullah of Jordan was on a visit to Kosovo.
A couple and their three children from Sakhnin in northern Israel, who joined ISIS last year after travelling to Turkey and sneaking over the border into Syria, have returned to Turkey. They met with family members and in the coming days are expected to return to Israel. The couple will be arrested upon their return after which the husband is expected to be charged.

The family left Israel in 2015 for Romania in order to attend a graduation ceremony for a family member who finished their studies. After arriving in Romania, they decided to enter Turkey and attempted to cross illegally into Syria. After their family learned of their intentions, they flew to Turkey to try and persuade them to return to Israel, but were unsuccessful.
The family reuniting in Turkey

A Galilee resident who knows the family said the, "family members went to Turkey and made every effort to get them to come back. In the end, they managed to find them and explain the dangers of life with ISIS. The mother and the daughters did not want to go to Syria, but the husband insisted. Right now, I don't know what needs to be done to get them back to Israel, but it is important. I hope to see them back with their family."
The mayor of Sakhnin, Mazen Ghanaym, said that when he learned the family joined ISIS, "We were completely surprised. These are respectful people who want for nothing. The husband works and is organized, but it is a shame he made a decision like that. We are against Arab citizens joining organizations like ISIS. Our religion is different to their criminal actions."

How the idea came up?
While in college we had countless friends get open container tickets during tailgates or complained about paying too much for drinks at concerts and sporting events. Unless you're a 70 year old talking about the good ole days, carrying around a standard flask looked kinda weird! We knew there had to be a better way to discretely bring the joy of throwing one back with your friends to countless events worldwide...Thus the iFlask was born!
The iFlask - #TFM status for sure
Why we need your help/what are the funds going towards?
We are just two young professionals from the mid-west with limited resources. We are looking for help with manufacturing costs, getting economies of scale, a plant visit (which will speed up the process immensely and also allow for better quality control) and funding for the initial production run. That is why we're hoping the Kickstarter community (You!) can come together and help us reach our goal of 40k.
What others are saying? Check it out!
Berkeleysg.com
How many ounces/shots does it hold?
The iFlask holds about 5oz, or 5 one ounce shots
iFlask holds about 5 shots of your favorite beverage
What is the iFlask made out of and will it be sturdy?
Our iFlask is made out of Polyethylene and polycarbonate. This plastic is very smooth and extremely sturdy and will withstand just about anything besides Rebecca Black's singing. Its light weight and also very safe and toxic free. The lid and bottle opener are made out of stainless steel which makes it very sturdy and look super trendy. Thus giving it that extra 'cool' factor.
Why the iFlask?
Well first its super cool, Duh!! But it's a great conversation starter. Its super discrete, and it will make you the talk of the town :)… The iFlask makes it just that much more nonchalant so you can walk around not looking like THAT guy.
Dont be THAT GUY... With iFlask you dont have to be!
You will have countless people asking you are you drinking from your Smartphone? Where did you get that? Can i buy one? Do you live around here? Lets get out of here... Plus you will be able to save boat loads of money and keep your buzz going all night long!

Additionally, it will be possible to “easily find and purchase games that are new, popular and on sale, as well as use filters to search by genre.”
Head past the break for today's full announcement.
REDMOND, Wash., March 29, 2016 – Don't miss out on being a part of a Nintendo first! On March 31, Miitomo, the company's first-ever smart device application, is launching in the United States and several other countries. Miitomo is a free-to-start social experience that lets users spark one-of-a-kind conversations with friends in a whole new way using Mii characters. The app recently launched in Japan and was downloaded more than 1 million times in its first three days of availability, while achieving the #1 most downloaded free app status in both the App Store and Google Play storefronts. “With Miitomo, Nintendo takes its first step into the world of smart devices,” said Scott Moffitt, Nintendo of America's Executive Vice President of Sales & Marketing. “Miitomo brings the special Nintendo charm and polish that people around the world love to an entirely new format and audience.” Getting started with Miitomo and being a part of this Nintendo milestone is easy: After downloading the application for free on the App Store for iPhone, iPod Touch or iPad, along with Android devices, users create a Mii character and customize facial features like eyes and hair, as well as voice and personality. Users can also use the camera on their smart devices to snap a photo of themselves, which can be used to create a Mii, or they can simply import their Mii from their Wii U or Nintendo 3DS systems using a QR Code. Once their Mii is ready, users can add friends who already have the app in person, or by linking the app with their existing Facebook or Twitter accounts. After that step is complete, it's time to answer some questions! Miitomo creates conversations and turns discussions into a form of play by prompting users to answer all kinds of fun questions. How would you define your fashion style? What's the weirdest thing you've ever eaten? If you were given ten grand to spend in one day, what would you do? The answers get shared among friends, sparking interesting conversations – part of the fun is discovering unexpected facts about your friends. When users hear how their friends responded to questions, they can give answers a “heart” or a written or picture comment. To preregister for Miitomo, users can sign up for a Nintendo Account at https://miitomo.com before March 31 to receive an email when the app is ready to download. People that create their Nintendo Account and preregister before March 31 will also receive Platinum Points for the new My Nintendo rewards program, which will simultaneously launch with Miitomo. Aiming to be much more than a standard rewards program, My Nintendo is a comprehensive service that rewards users for interacting with Nintendo products and services in a variety of ways. Miitomo users who link the app to their Nintendo Account will be able to take advantage of My Nintendo to enhance their experience. Platinum Points can be earned by interacting with Nintendo apps and services, including Miitomo. Gold Points are earned when purchasing digital versions of games from Nintendo.com or Nintendo eShop on Wii U and Nintendo 3DS. Both Platinum and Gold Points can be redeemed for rewards like games, download content, in-app items and eShop discount coupons. In addition to Miitomo and the Nintendo program, Nintendo is also launching an enhanced Wii U and Nintendo 3DS shop on Nintendo.com on March 31 for users with a Nintendo Account to purchase digital games. Featuring an expanded catalog of more than 2,000 games, this digital store can be accessed on personal computers or smart devices. The shop serves as an additional purchase option to Nintendo eShop on Wii U and Nintendo 3DS, with all purchases being sent directly to users' Nintendo 3DS or Wii U systems for download. Users can now easily find and purchase games that are new, popular and on sale, as well as use filters to search by genre. Purchases of games from this site, as well as Nintendo eShop, will earn My Nintendo Gold Points.

Addressing his Likud Party faction just one week after his visit to the United States, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu say that it was the responsibility of Israel's leadership to “eliminate” the threat posed by the Iranian government's civilian nuclear program. “Who will eliminate it? It is us or no one.”
Netanyahu seemed pleased with the results of his US visit, dismissing US criticisms of his plan to expand settlements as “a disagreement between good friends,” and insisting that he had received pledges for several “key pieces” of military aid from the US.
Israel has been threatening to attack Iran over its nuclear program for years, and it was recently reported that CIA director Leon Panetta was dispatched to Israel in an effort to convince Netanyahu not to launch any surprise attacks on Iran.
Though the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has repeatedly certified that the Iranian nuclear program has not diverted any of its enriched uranium to any covert purpose and the United States' own National Intelligence Estimate (NIE) says Iran has no nuclear weapons program, Israel and US officials continue to accuse Iran of having such aspirations.

The solar system is a dangerous place with asteroids and comets zipping past the Earth on a daily basis. While there are no extinction-level cosmic rocks heading towards a collision with the Earth (that we know of), the disturbing increase in the number of near misses in recent years is bringing renewed attention to the concept of asteroid defense.
In the spirit of our upcoming game Orbit Path, which is all about avoiding cosmic collisions, I've done some research to collect the 3 best options we have when it comes to asteroid defense.
Option 1: Kinetic Deflection
Kinetic deflection is a fancy way to describe crashing one thing into another. With kinetic deflection, the idea proposed by scientists is to crash a probe into an incoming asteroid with the hope that change in momentum from the collision would be enough to deflect the asteroid from it's cosmic date with Earth. Widely considered to be the most mature and effective defense, kinetic deflection was demonstrated as an unintended side effect of the Deep Impact space probe mission in 2005.
The Deep Impact probe used a planned collision with the comet Tempel 1 to help scientists understand the internal composition of comets. The 370 kg probe's collision with Tempel 1 delivered roughly the equivalent of 4.8 tons of TNT. That impact is estimated to have knocked the comet 10 meters offits trajectory around the sun.
The European Space Agency is currently planning the AIDA mission to prove the viability of this method. Planned for launch in 2021, the impactor would target the asteroid 65803 Didymos. The goal of the mission to measure the change in momentum of an asteroid from a collision with the probe, thereby giving us an idea of how to go about building one of these devices should we detect an asteroid on a collision course with Earth.
Option 2: The Gravity Tractor
While our gut instinct to an Earth-bound asteroid might be ‘nuke the bastard', the Gravity Tractor relies on nothing but Newton's principles of gravity to gradually nudge an asteroid off a collision course with Earth. The idea behind a Gravity tractor is to launch a heavy unmanned satellite to orbit an incoming asteroid. The mass of the spacecraft and that of the asteroid mutually attracts them, meaning that over a period of years the asteroid will slowly accelerate to the satellite which could be enough of a shift in trajectory to push the asteroid safely away from the Earth. While Hollywood will probably never make a movie about a Gravity tractor, this defense is subtle and actually quite brilliant as it relies on the fundamental laws of gravity to work. The one downside to a Gravity tractor is that it requires that we have years of advanced warning for the scheme to work.
Option 3: Nuke the Bastard
When all else fails and an asteroid impact is imminent we are left with the Michael Bay defense: a massive nuclear bomb. Nuking an asteroid isn't as easy as punching in the coordinates and cracking off a salvo of Minuteman missiles. For one, most asteroids that are likely to cause an extinction level event (> 1 km in diameter) likely won't be destroyed by a conventional nuclear warhead. Further, nuking an asteroid comes with the very real risk of causing 1 big asteroid to split into 2 or more pieces all of which could still be heading towards Earth.
In 1995 Edward Teller, the American scientist and ‘father of the hydrogen bomb' proposed the creation of a 1 gigaton nuclear device, weighing 25-30 tons that would be launched atop of Russia's Energia rocket and sent to obliterate any asteroid less than 1 km wide and deflect any up to 10 km in diameter. Teller's scheme was designed to be a last ditch effort designed to be put in use in the event we had less than a year's warning before collision. There is no word whether the US or Russia have developed such a massive nuclear weapon.
Unfortunately, asteroid defense has been given very little attention by world leaders and the scientific community broadly, as any solution would require billions of dollars of investment and multi-year commitments from the governments involved. It's likely we'll never know how effective any of these options are until the day comes when we need them. Asteroid defense is a lot like flood insurance, for most people they only realize they need it once they see the hurricane barreling towards them. Let's hope for our sake it's not too late when we do.

We talked in our last video post about more overseas workers coming to Japan and how both they and the Japanese locals felt about working together (Find it here). However, perhaps we jumped the gun a little, by neglecting to ask whether or not people actually want to come and live in Japan in the first place!
Maybe for many would-be members of Japan's workforce, a life in Japan just boils down to simple math, i.e. How much money can I earn here?
There are those who might see Japan as an escape from persecution/imminent danger elsewhere. Although rather than going on to ask about money or work conditions, many of these people will need to ask themselves, Even if I want to, will I be let in?. Chances are slim. The current administration gets a lot of stick about its policy on asylum seekers ( out of 5,000 applicants for asylum in 2014, only 11 were granted , according to a REUTERS report), but it hasn't seen fit to change much, even in light of the crisis in Syria, and calls for help from Europe.
Japan has, though, come out and said it wants to make things easier for well educated / skilled workers to gain entry to the land and its opportunities . But maybe these people are wanted just as much back home. What's Japan got that could persuade them to leave the comforts of the familiar, and traipse halfway around the world to a place where the language looks like pictures not words, and their entire living quarters might amount to no more than their bedroom at mom and dad's.
The streets of Tokyo's Ginza district are booming with tourists this day, rich pickings then when it comes to asking the people above what would bring them to stay put on these shores, beyond vital necessity or money.
Take a look at the video of our interviews...
( Would you want to live in Japan? ) . Any guesses as to what the answers might be?
Maybe there are some surprises here, maybe there aren't. If you're a long-term expat going through that phase of finding plenty of things to get annoyed about, maybe some of the answers will help jog the memory and remind you of why you wanted to come to Japan in the first place, too!
The moderator for Tuesday night's vice presidential debate is getting a thumbs down by her peers in the media for not being more aggressive with the candidates, especially Republican Mike Pence.
Elaine Quijano, a CBS digital news anchor, took a largely hands-off approach to the one and only vice presidential debate, allowing Pence and Democrat Tim Kaine a more "open discussion."
Others in the media were dissatisfied with her performance.
"[S]he is to blame for preventing real debate, and for allowing Mike Pence to pretend he isn't running on a ticket with Donald Trump," said liberal writer Isaac Chotiner at Slate.
CNN media reporter Dylan Byers said Quijano "lost control" of the debate and "stopped the candidates when they were in the middle of a good discussion and failed to stop them when they were simply talking over one another."
Glenn Thrush, Politico's top political correspondent, said her "inexperience" showed.
Quijano was rarely seen on camera, even when she spoke. She asked almost no follow-up questions, did not fact-check the candidates and re-directed the candidates to address specific questions only a couple times when they wandered off topic.
Her style was in direct contrast to last week's presidential debate, moderated by NBC News anchor Lester Holt, who was far more aggressive in following up on topics. He asked Donald Trump roughly seven follow-ups to Hillary Clinton's one. Holt also rebutted Trump on several occasions, attempting to fact-check him live.
Kaine spent much of the debate repeatedly challenging Pence to answer for controversial marks Trump has made throughout the campaign, such as calling some Mexican illegal immigrants "rapists."
Pence almost exclusively met those challenges by shaking his head and pivoting to an attack against Clinton or Kaine.
Quijano did not interject to side with Kaine, though at some points when Kaine was attacking Pence, she redirected the debate to a new topic.
"[Lester] Holt was looking better in hindsight," wrote Politico media reporter Hadas Gold.
Is Tablo right for you? You've heard the buzz and read the expert reviews, but sometimes it helps to hear the whole story from real Tablo customers to know if this is the right solution for you. Our latest blog series, "How I Cut the Cord with Tablo" features Q&A style interviews with our Tablo OTA DVR customers, focusing on how they've cut the cord on cable to save money while enjoying a whole-home DVR experience using Tablo. Whether you're still on the fence about cutting the cord or you're just looking for tips and tricks on how to improve your cord-cutting setup, we hope you'll find these cord-cutting success stories helpful.
Why did you cut the cord? How much money are you saving each month?
I was paying $200 per month with Cox Cable. We were spending all that money to spend most of our time channel surfing for something worthwhile to watch. I started cord cutting with a Roku to watch Netflix, Amazon and Hulu. After researching OTA DVRs (Tablo and TiVo), I chose to add Tablo for its technology and money saving features.
Specifically, Tablo allows me to upgrade the replaceable hard drive to any size. The Live TV grid guide looks so advanced and polished compared to any cable provider. Access to all of Tablo's features isn't free but in comparison to pay TV it's a great deal. I paid less than $50 for a yearly subscription.
What do you get with an HDTV antenna that you couldn't get another way?
I am extremely excited about the quality of Over-The-Air programs in high definition. It's so beautiful! Way better than cable quality which is compressed. Live sports look phenomenal! You know where the game is played? My house.
Why did you choose the Tablo OTA DVR as part of your home entertainment arsenal?
I chose Tablo because I needed to save money while keeping my family's appetite for TV on-demand satisfied, no matter where or when. Plus, I think the ability to have unlimited storage by adding large USB powered hard drives and ease-of-use puts Tablo over-the-top with regards to cost saving and top quality performance in my home.
What's been the best thing about using/having Tablo so far?
The best thing about Tablo is the guide. The interface is user-friendly with large images displaying the shows and movie titles available. It feels so interactive and I have the option to peruse by the category of show I like or just look at the day's schedule. Travelling for work or with my globe-trotting family we have access to our local stations which is great when our 2 year old needs his Sesame Street. It is a Lifesaver.
What other services and tools do you use to watch TV/Video content and why?
I have a Roku with the Tablo app on one TV, my Sony Smart TV with an Android TV operating system runs the Tablo app natively, and I use the web for streaming Tablo content when I travel. We also subscribe to Netflix, Amazon and Hulu for additional content options.
What advice do you have for others thinking of cutting the cord?
Do your research first. I started where I usually start which is with a CNET review of OTA devices. Then I looked at detailed reviews on Amazon. To see which antenna (strength/distance) I needed and where and how to place it, I used TVFool.com. After that, cord cutting was easy as pie.
If you're already enjoying your Tablo OTA DVR, remember to post a review of your DVR on the online store where you purchased your unit and let your fellow cord-cutters know how Tablo works for you.
If you'd like to participate in the 'How I cut the cord with Tablo' blog series, drop us a line at info@tablotv.com. We'd love to hear your story.

Are you interested in actually influencing a religious believer to start thinking critically, rather than just scoring “points” that only you are counting? Are you bored with doing the same old song and dance with faith-based minds, assured that your arguments were better, but knowing they had no effect? Would you like to make a difference rather than just make noise?
Dan Fincke, who writes the very astute blog Camels With Hammers, has written a series of ten articles titled “Tips for Reaching Out to Religious Believers.” Dan has a PhD in philosophy, and is a highly skilled teacher at six different universities in the New York area. He is adept at getting his students to challenge their own beliefs and assumptions, and to grow beyond their initial self-expectations.
I highly recommend reading these thorough and cogent short essays, each delineating approaches and techniques that are essential in the art of rational persuasion. Dan explains what works, what doesn't, and why. If you use even some of these tips, I think you will find yourself less frustrated and more encouraged after interacting with religious believers.
Here are the links:
1. Don't Call Religious Believers Stupid.
2. Make Believers Stay on Topic During Debates.
3. Don't Tell Religious Believers What They “Really Believe”.
5. Help Break The Spell Of Religious Reverence.
6. Don't Demonize Religious People's Motives, Focus On Their Objective Harms.
7. Take Philosophy Seriously.
8. Both Refute The Best Counter-Arguments You Can Think Of And Create Gestalt Shifts.
9. Be Unapologetic, Rigorous, Patient, And Gracious With Religious Believers.
10. Love Religious People.
Austin Police are investigating a shooting that took place in the early morning hours of the new year.
Victoria Rocha said she was at 6th and Brazos on New Year's Eve. According to her, just moments after midnight she was shot by a stray bullet.
Austin Police told KVUE Tuesday that the downtown HALO cameras didn't capture the incident and no witnesses have come forward.
So for now, Rocha is trying to heal.
"I can't get into the shower, I can't get on the bed, I can't get up in the car, he has to help me lift it, it feels really heavy," said Rocha.
Rocha recalled what happened that night.
"I stood up and was like 'oh my leg is like, what, my leg's not moving,' it started to burn, then I felt the burning sensation," said Rocha.
She saw blood rushing down her leg, and thought a firework had hit her.
That's until doctors at the hospital told her a 45 millimeter bullet had gone through her leg.
"It came directly down, and it came out this end of my leg," said Rocha.
She's thankful the bullet didn't hit an artery or bone, but it did tear a lot of muscle, forcing the mom of four to stay home from work.
She now has a GoFundMe page to raise money for expenses.
"I cry over frustration because I get so mad that why me, and I am very grateful that I'm alive, but it still makes me really angry that now I have to deal with this," said Rocha.
Now she has a message for the person who shot the gun.
"Why, did you not think it was going to fall? Did you not think someone could get hurt?" Rocha asked.
She feels guns are for protection, not for celebrating.
Police don't have any suspect information at this time.

Audio Federal authorities are holding fewer immigrants in detention, a reversal in a decade-long upward trend of locking people up who are in the deportation process. The detainees are facing deportation for various reasons, including committing a crime or being in the U.S. illegally.
The number of immigrants being held in detention centers across the U.S. is the lowest it's been in nearly a decade, possibly signaling a change in a federal mandate called a ”bed quota.”
Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention centers range from stand alone prison-type facilities to county jails. They hold non-American citizens who are facing deportation for various reasons, including committing a crime or being in the country illegally.
Some members of Congress and high-ranking officials in the U.S. Department of Homeland Security have insisted a line in a federal law mandating 34,000 detention beds across the country is actually a quota — requiring ICE to lock up a daily average of 34,000 people.
But the latest federal government figures show the average daily detainee population for the first five months of fiscal 2015 was 26,374. Last year, an average of more than 33,000 people were being held on a daily basis, and since 2007, the number has always been more than 30,000.
This decrease is a reversal in a trend that had the numbers of immigrants in detention increasing. It reflects state and federal policy changes, and possibly a change in the interpretation of the law mandating 34,000 detention beds available across the country.
Royce Murray, director of policy at the National Immigration Justice Center, which advocates for immigrants, sees the decline in the number of detainees as positive.
“We're encouraged if every single bed is not full,” Murray said.
Her group has also advocated for the federal government to put an end to the “bed quota,” which was added to the Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act in 2007.
The law introduced the idea of mandating a specific number of detention beds, 33,400, and later increased it to 34,000.
The Department of Homeland Security oversees ICE and Customs and Border Protection. Both agencies apprehend and deport immigrants who are in the country illegally or have committed a crime and face deportation. ICE is also charged with detaining the immigrants in about 250 facilities across the country if they're viewed as a security or flight risk. Detention is meant to be a secure holding place while they wait for their cases to be decided by a judge, rather than punitive.
Last year, on average, immigrants spent 30 days in detention.
National news outlets drew attention to the bed mandate, calling it a “quota” in 2013, when ICE released more than 2,000 detainees to save money. At the time, House Homeland Security Committee Chairman Michael McCaul, R-Texas, wrote to the director of ICE, telling him by not filling all 34,000 detention beds he was “in clear violation of statute.”
And in 2013, in his written testimony to the House Committee on the Judiciary, ICE director John Morton also said his department was required to “maintain a yearly average daily population of approximately 34,000 individuals.”
But Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson testified at a budget committee last year with a different interpretation.
“I would interpret that (the mandate) to mean we have to maintain 34,000 detention beds. Some of those beds might be empty at any given time,” Johnson, who was sworn into office in late 2013, told the budget committee.
Murray said while her organization was encouraged by what Johnson said at the time, it was waiting to see whether his interpretation “trickled down to the field level.”
An ICE official in San Diego wouldn't comment on whether Johnson's interpretation was a change in the department's policy but acknowledged the detainee population has declined “based on a variety of factors.”
They include a growing number of local police agencies refusing to hold immigrants for 48 hours while ICE determines whether it wants to detain or deport them — a program once called Secure Communities; an expanded use of detention alternatives such as ankle bracelets; and a change in enforcement policies because of President Barack Obama's executive action.
Among the change in policies, the administration directed the DHS to focus on apprehending and deporting immigrants convicted of a felony or those known to be gang members. Under the president's order, people who are in the country illegally, never committed a serious crime and who haven't ignored previous deportation orders, “will not be priorities for removal.”
“Now there's more of a focus on people with gang ties, perpetrators of domestic violence and perpetrators of trafficking crimes,” said Matt Holt, an immigration attorney and chairman of the San Diego chapter of the American Immigration Lawyers Association.
“And those are the people who should be locked up,” Holt said.
But he said ICE continues to take people into custody who have never committed a crime, and who have been living productive lives in the community.
Last year, about 44 percent of detainees were not considered “criminals,” according to ICE statistics.
The bed mandate and a for-profit private prison model contribute to immigrants being detained rather than being given ankle bracelets, a much less expensive option, Holt said.
Two private prison companies operate some of the largest ICE detention centers, including the one in San Diego County. It costs about $125 a day to keep someone in detention, or about $2 billion a year to maintain the 34,000 beds.

We're proud and pleased to present the exclusive premiere of Riley Flood's new music video for “Sunshine,” off of his 2016 debut Phases EP!
The video, which was directed by Laura Marie Anthony and co-produced by both Riley Flood and J-R Thompson, was filmed at The Dock Recording Studios and Panama Art Factory in Sacramento, CA
Based out of breezy Sacramento, California, Flood first found himself rooting deep into the chasms and crevasses of classic rock, armed with a guitar in hand and an unbelievably open mind. Little did he realize then that the floodgates would soon thereafter swing wide open, unleashing a deluge of musical influence that would wash over Riley in the forms of multiple musical roles (vocals, guitar, bass, and keys) and several local bands (culminating in his largest project yet, the now-disbanded Nylon Lyonn)- all the while expanding his pool of influence and interests as he indulged in spate after spate of writing styles and musical efforts. And in another instantaneous flash-flood, Riley Flood emerged in late 2016 with his own solo work, under which a 4-track EP titled Phases was born. Equal parts modern indie-rock, classic rock, and neo-psychedelia, Riley's latest work is nothing short of an aural painting of a breezy, sun-drenched day in California, with the right amount of roughness around the edges to reflect a classic stylization of cool that can hardly be found in the modern age- and the tide of Riley Flood has yet to subside.
About Riley Flood
Riley Flood is an artist from Sacramento, California. He began playing guitar at 14 after developing an interest in classic rock. In the following years, Riley expanded his horizons as a musician playing with a variety of local bands in a number of musical roles including vocals, guitar, bass, and keys, all while developing his songwriting style and expanding his circle of musical influences. After his most recent project, Nylon Lyonn, disbanded he realized he would have to begin a solo project in order to shape his sound. Riley Flood now creates music with positive, and expressive melodies that are reminiscent of both his classic rock influences and his more contemporary indie and psychedelic rock influences.

BALTIMORE -- The Cleveland Indians are starting to party like it's 2016.
On Monday night at Camden Yards, the defending American League champs pummeled the Baltimore Orioles 12-0 for their sixth straight win. When the streak started, the Indians were a .500 club that was two games back in what has looked like a decidedly mediocre AL Central division. Less than a week later, they're two-and-a-half games up and looking a whole lot like a team that's ready to run away and hide.
Interestingly, Cleveland's current streak comes at almost exactly the same time that the squad started rolling last season, when they kicked off a franchise-record 14-game winning streak in mid-June, finished the month with a 22-6 record, then never looked back. The difference is, while last year's wake-up call was fueled by a starting rotation that caught fire, this year's coming-out party has been built on blistering bats.
Cleveland came into the series opener in Baltimore with a five-game winning streak during which the team averaged eight runs per contest. On Monday they pounded out 17 hits, including 10 extra-base knocks, en route to scoring 12 runs. While the O's staff has been ailing, the fact that the outburst came against Dylan Bundy made it all the more impressive.

The de facto ace of the Orioles, Bundy has been the lone bright spot in an Orioles rotation that ranks dead last in the American League in pretty much every major category. The former first-round pick, who came in with a 3.29 ERA that ranked ninth among AL starters, cruised early, allowing just one hit through three scoreless frames. But the Indians broke through in the middle innings, batting around in both the fourth and fifth.
In the fourth inning alone, they tallied four doubles off Bundy, who had never allowed more than three doubles in an entire game. In the fifth, they collected four more extra-base hits, including a mammoth leadoff homer by Jason Kipnis that sailed beyond the flag court in right and landed on Eutaw Street. It was just the 90th homer to land on Eutaw since Camden Yards opened 25 years ago.
Jose Ramirez followed with a loud lineout to right, then Edwin Encarnacion walked, putting an early end to Bundy's night after just 4 1/3 innings. It was the first time all season that Bundy failed to last five innings, yet one more sign that Cleveland's bats are burning right now.
Just how hot is Terry Francona's lineup? So hot that not even a pregame downpour -- and the resulting 29-minute rain delay -- could cool off the Indians' attack.
"It's contagious," said outfielder Austin Jackson, who drove in three runs with a pair of doubles. "From top to bottom, everybody's having good at-bats. We've been doing a good job driving the ball."
And right now, nobody's doing a better job than Ramirez.
Earlier in the day, Cleveland's third baseman was named the AL Player of the Week after a ridiculous seven-game stretch in which he hit .516 with 8 doubles, 3 homers and 7 RBIs. On Monday night, the 24-year old Dominican native picked up right where he left off, going 3-for-6 with a triple and two doubles.
Ramirez has now hit at least one double in seven straight games, a franchise record, and has raised his average nearly 40 points in less than a week. According to Elias, he's the first player in the modern era (post-1900) with at least 14 extra-base hits in a seven-game stretch.
"That's incredible," said Francona, almost at a loss for words to describe the zone his three-hole hitter is in right now. "He obviously makes solid contact a lot, but he uses the whole field and doesn't strike out much. That's hard to defend. He's just putting the barrel on the ball so often."
As a result, the Indians are scoring runs by the bushel. Or as was the case on Monday, by the dozen -- which was 11 more than Corey Kluber needed.
"He's a bulldog on the mound," said Jackson of Kluber, the 2014 Cy Young winner who spent three weeks on the shelf earlier this season with a back strain.
Since coming back in late May, the 31-year old righty has been up to his old tricks, pitching to a 1.61 ERA and posting a 39-to-4 whiff-walk ratio. On Monday against Baltimore, he tossed a complete game, three-hit shutout, fanning 11 without walking a batter. In the process, he became just the fifth hurler in Tribe history to spin a road shutout with 10-plus punchouts and zero walks. Perhaps more importantly, he has been keeping the guys behind him in the game.
"When he's on the mound, guys get up for it," said Jackson of Kluber. "When we put a few runs on the board, that seems to be enough for a pitcher like him."
On Monday, as they've been doing a lot lately, the Indians put up more than a few runs.
"You've seen a different team, a different energy with us the last week," Kipnis said. "It shows us what we can do when we bring that energy. It's been a fun week for us."
[All views are my own and are not those of my employer.]
I think that animals matter morally, and I think that wild animals matter as much as domestic animals do. These are pretty controversial statements, but they'd take many blog posts to address, so I'm mostly going to be talking to an audience that agrees with me about both points.
One common objection I want to examine a little more closely is the “naturalness” objection– that it is ill-advised to interfere with the natural order of things, perhaps because there may be consequences that you are not capable of foreseeing. It's true that interactions with nature often have unforeseen consequences. If you let your fertilizer run off into a lake, snails will have more to eat; the snails are a secondary host for a parasite that infects frogs; the parasite causes leg deformities in frogs. You wouldn't guess that one of the consequences of fertilizing your crops is deformed frogs, but in reality it is.
The problem with this objection is that all landscapes are touched by humanity. The heaths of Scotland are a product of human intervention going back thousands of years. Human beings in the Pleistocene played a vitally important role (along with climate change) in the extinction of megafauna such as the mammoth. To get these ecosystems to return to an untouched state, one would have to wind back the clock not decades but millennia.
Furthermore, today in the United States, if something is untouched wilderness, it's a untouched wilderness because someone decided that that particular tract of land needed to be untouched wilderness and another tract over there could be safely transformed into condominiums. Natural parks and reserves are usually managed to allow outdoor recreation like hunting, fishing, wildlife photography, and hiking; national forests often allow logging and livestock grazing. And of course all areas– not matter how untouched– are affected by climate change, pollution, and other global changes that humans have wrought.
There just isn't a natural wilderness unaffected by humans. It doesn't exist. It doesn't make sense to argue about whether it would be a good idea to leave untouched wilderness alone, because there isn't any. Because of our power, humans are already the stewards of nature. The only question is whether we will care about our charges' happiness or neglect them. And the same management principles that are used to handle things like eutrophication can be used to handle issues of wild-animal suffering as well.
Unlike many anti-wild-animal-suffering advocates, I currently do not support destroying habitat. Partially, this is because I am not sure whether I care about insects. If you think insects are sufficiently morally important, there is an open-and-shut case for habitat destruction, because insect lives suck a lot and they are too tiny and numerous to manage. Since I have a high degree of uncertainty about whether they matter at all, and I wouldn't care about them very much even if they did matter, I don't view this as an open-and-shut argument.
I am very uncertain about the quality of life of the average wild bird or mammal. On one hand, they typically experience disease, fear, stress, and a painful death. On the other hand, they get a lot of opportunities to explore, play, engage in social interaction, and perform natural behaviors. I don't think anyone really knows for certain; it's simply not been studied enough. I'm also uncertain about the quality of life of the average bird or mammal, given predator removal, addition of food during winters or famines, population management through contraceptives or pain-minimizing hunting, vaccination programs, etc. With an ecologically informed, humane management strategy, is it possible to make wild animal lives worth living in a cost-effective way? I'm not sure.
Humans get a lot of benefits from the continued existence of wild ecosystems, ranging from wild food to climate regulation to their aesthetic value. These benefits disproportionately affect the global poor, who are more likely to eat bushmeat, more likely to be victims of climate change, and who get to look at nature like all the time. I am concerned that habitat destruction will cause grave harm to human beings. (This is a really good paper about the economic and well-being consequences of environmental damage, and I encourage interested people to read it.)
I am concerned about the effects of habitat destruction on currently existing animals. Habitat destruction often hurts the animals that live in the habitat: being burned alive because someone is doing slash-and-burn agriculture on your forest is not a pleasant death. Among animals who live in new, smaller habitats, there are edge effects, which are often harmful to the animal: for instance, edge effects increase the risk of fires in the Amazon rainforest, and they can also make animals more vulnerable to predation.
It is difficult to undestroy a habitat: once a species is extinct, it's gone; a sufficiently small species will often go extinct even if conservation efforts are made to preserve it; destroying a habitat may involve physical changes that are difficult to reverse; many habitats are a product of decades if not centuries of succession which would have to be repeated. For this reason, I feel it is best to err on the side of not destroying habitat.
I think that in the long term the right attitude for anti-wild-animal-suffering advocates is something like conservation biology. Conservation biology successfully shifted US land management policy from “we care about things that benefit humans, like timber and hunting” to “we care about things that benefit humans AND biodiversity.” I think the end game for anti-wild-animal-suffering advocacy is to shift it to “we care about things that benefit humans AND biodiversity AND the wellbeing of the animals under our care.”
I think this might be the least difficult sell from a public-relations perspective. I think it triggers the whole “leave nature alone” intuition less if we advocate for the well-being of animals to be considered as part of land management, that is, in decisions about nature that humans are already making. I also think that this might enable us to ally more closely with hunters. Assuming that a hunter's bullet is one of the least painful ways to die (which is not always true, but often is), anti-wild-animal-suffering advocates should promote a massive increase in hunting. Hunters also support some policies, such as providing supplemental food during winters, which conservationists typically disapprove of and which anti-wild-animal-suffering advocates might like.
I also think it might be one of the most effective ways of using activist dollars to help wild animals without destroying habitat, because we'd be focusing on changing the way that the US government spends its money. A single lobbying dollar can influence many more dollars of US government spending.
I have only looked into the history of conservation biology a little bit, but I think one of the key points of their success is combining activist energy with mainstream academic credibility. Conservation biology, in its early days, had many tenured professors whose research had had a lot of influence on the science of ecology, such as E. O. Wilson. Anti-wild-animal-suffering advocacy is distinctly lacking in academic credibility; the few academics interested in it are usually in unrelated fields like economics (Tyler Cowen, Yew-Kwang Ng) or philosophy (Oscar Horta). This is not only a problem for our ability to influence policymakers but also for our ability to understand what we want to influence them to do, which would probably involve a lot of careful ecological research that simply isn't being performed.
Unfortunately, it may be more difficult to get biologists to be interested in animal welfare than it is in biodiversity, because the loss of biodiversity is a direct threat to the thing they're studying. Nevertheless, I think that outreach to academic biologists is quite important. I also suggest that students who care about wild animal suffering and have an interest in biology strongly consider a career as an academic biologist specializing in wild-animal welfare.

The organisations fighting for the merger of disputed district of Belgaum with Maharashtra have now decided to intensify their stir with re-branding their movement Second Samyukta Maharashtra Andolan.Making an emotional pitch, the activists are now reaching out to public servants, youth organisations, academicians and students from across Maharashtra to consolidate their support in order to pressure the government for an early solution to the issue.Members of least half a dozen organisations are holding a daylong consultation in Churchgate on Sunday to chalk out a strategy. A signature campaign will be launched at the end of the day, with other programmes to be rolled out in January.
What are activists saying?
Maloji Ashtekar, ex-mayor of Belgaum and general secretary of Maharashtra Ekikaran Samiti (MES) said, "The Samyukta Maharashtra movement, for which our leaders fought in 1956 and got the state of Maharashtra in 1960, is still incomplete with Belgaum being out of its fold despite having a majority of Marathi-speaking population. With support from the people of Maharashtra, we wish to take the movement on a larger scale."
Deepak Pawar, a professor at Mumbai university and head of the Marathi Abhyas Kendra, a centre to promote Marathi, said, "In 1995-99, the Sena-BJP government failed to merge Belgaum with the state despite having BJP government at Centre. With the second movement, we want both governments to look into the injustice meted out to lakhs of Marathis in Belgaum."
What is the issue?
Belgaum was included in Karnataka in accordance with the States Reorganisation Act of 1956. There are four cities and 865 villages in Belgaum district on which Maharashtra has been staking claim for the past 60 years on linguistic grounds.
Following protests from Maharashtra, the Centre constituted a commission headed by Justice MC Mahajan in 1966, which recommended that Belgaum should be a part of Karnataka. While Centre and Karnataka accepted Mahajan Commission's recommendation, Maharashtra moved court.
MES, which came into being in 1948 for getting Belgaum into Maharashtra, has been spearheading the movement since then. It has been demanding a plebiscite and central rule in the area till the boundary dispute is resolved.
What is the legal status?
A petition filed by Maharashtra is pending before the Supreme Court since 2004. The court has formed a committee under Manmohan Sarin, retired chief justice of Jammu & Kashmir high court to examine witnesses from both states. Witnesses from Maharashtra will file affidavits on January 9, 2015. Karnataka has been asked to submit affidavits of witnesses after next week. After this, the Sarin committee has been asked to submit its report within a month.
Is this a political issue?
While Kannadiga scholars have been claiming that it's a political issue with no ground support from the people, Marathi activists have rubbished the claims, saying besides population statistics it's the "wish of the people" which keeps movement going. "Had there not been support of people, how would the movement survive for 60 years? The disputed area has over 15 lakh Marathis. Out of 58 corporators in the Belgaun corporation, 34 are Marathi-speaking. They all wish to be part of Maharashtra," said Ashtekar.
What is Karnataka doing?
It renamed the district Belagavi last month after getting a nod from the Centre. It is planning to make it the state's second capital. The state's second assembly has already been set up on the outskirts of Belgaum at a cost of Rs450 crore.
Trichy: Six boys rescued from the streets escaped from TMSSS Sontham boys' home in Trichy city on Sunday evening, bringing to fore the lack of security at the children's homes. Though the home administration tried to keep the issue under the wraps, the police and the district child protection unit (DCPU) confirmed the escape of the boys and also the rescue of four of them on Monday.Six boys, all minors, allegedly escaped from the home at V N Nagar 3rd street at Chinthamani in the city on Sunday. They were brought to the home after they were rescued as child labourers and runaway children. The authorities were waiting for orders from the child welfare committee (CWC) for proper rehabilitation.When TOI enquired with the home administration on Monday afternoon, one of the staff denied that boys had escaped from the home. The staff also maintained that all the children kept in the home were safe.Meanwhile, the matter reached the city police which began investigation during the course of which the home admitted to the fact that six boys had indeed escaped from the home. The information of the escape of the home was not even passed to the district child protection unit (DCPU).Initially, district child protection office (DCPO) M Geetha feigned ignorance about the escape of the children but later she confirmed that they had escaped from by climbing over the gate.“Though the boys ran away from the home in the evening on Sunday, the home did not inform us. After I came to know about the escape, I enquired with them. We have asked them to give an explanation for not reporting the matter to us,” DCPO Geetha told TOI. She also said that four boys were traced and the search was on to trace the remaining two.“Four boys who went back to their parents were brought back to the home,” said Geetha.A Mylvaganan, DCP (law and order), Trichy city, said that the home told the police about the escape after the police enquired about it based on information. “The search is on to rescue the boys. They should file a complaint based on which we will register a case,” Mylvaganan told TOI.
Samsung Galaxy Note 4 has not been confirmed as part of the Sammy devices that will be receiving Android 7.0 Nougat, leave alone Android 7.1.1 Nougat. But it appears that the tech phone is currently being tested for the latter version, according to a listing on GFXBench.
Many owners of this phone will for sure be hoping that the new Android 7.0 Nougat update makes it to this handset, but whether Samsung will be willing to dedicate some time to work on the phone's update is still anyone's guess.
According to the benchmarking website, the said Samsung Galaxy Note 4 has Android 7.1.1 Nougat running the show. Under the hood, the phone has a Qualcomm Snapdragon 805 SoC that is clocked at a speed of 2.6GHz. This is then paired with a Qualcomm Adreno 420 GPU and 3GB of RAM. In terms of storage, the listed Galaxy Note 4 has 32GB and for photography, you get a 16MP main camera and 3.7MP lens for selfies.
It is strange that Samsung Galaxy Note 4 has not been officially confirmed whether or not it will receive an update to Android 7.0 Nougat or the newer v7.1.1. The phone was released in October 2014, which happened to be a month earlier than the release of the Google Nexus 6. Interestingly, the latter has already been updated to the latest Android 7.1.1 Nougat, but this should be the end of it.
The Google Nexus 6 shares the same hardware specs with the Galaxy Note 4 and as noted, it was released a month after the Note 4 went live. While we could say the Nexus 6 received the Nougat update just because it's a Google phone, this doesn't give Samsung a reason not to push the same OTA updates to the Note 4. If anything, it would mean folks at Samsung are somehow lazy, especially since there's really no major difference between the two phones' hardware.
Like the Galaxy Note 4, the Nexus 6 packs a Qualcomm Snapdragon 805 SoC that is clocked at a speed of 2.7GHz and is paired with an Adreno 420 GPU, 3GB RAM and 32GB storage. You get a 13MP shooter on the back and a 2MP lens for selfies.
Hopefully, this GFXBench listing is actually a confirmation that Android 7.1.1 Nougat is coming to the phablet Samsung Galaxy Note 4. It would be a delight for many, wouldn't it? Let us know what you think in the comments below.

The WoW Token will be going live in the Europe game region on April 21 at approximately 5 p.m. CEST. The WoW Token will be available for 20 EUR (15 GBP) from the in-game Shop, and will be set at a starting price of 35,000 gold in the Auction House across the Europe region. From that point forward, the gold price will automatically fluctuate based on player supply and demand. To start we'll be limiting the number of Token purchases from the Shop to 10 within a 30-day period, and the limit on Tokens purchased for gold will be set higher—though keep in mind these limits may be adjusted over time. While Tokens will be available immediately from the Shop, please note that there may be a delay before Tokens put up for sale on the Auction House become available for purchase with gold.
Using WoW Token Game Time with a Recurring Subscription
You can redeem WoW Tokens while you have an active recurring subscription—there's no need to suspend your subscription or resubscribe. Your recurring subscription will automatically pause when your currently paid-for subscription period ends (e.g. for monthly subscribers, at the end of your current 30-day period), and all redeemed WoW Token game time will be applied next. Note that you can have multiple WoW Tokens redeemed on your account at any given time. Once any accumulated WoW Token game time expires, your recurring subscription will automatically pick up where it left off.
Region-wide Exchange
As discussed in our original announcement, each game region (Americas, Europe, Korea, Taiwan, and China) will have its own shared WoW Token exchange.
Once purchased, a Token can then be put up for sale in a region-wide exchange via a new Game Time tab in the Auction House. While the rest of the Auction House will remain realm-based, a region-wide WoW Token exchange will provide the largest possible pool of prospective buyers and ensures everyone has access to a vibrant, active Token marketplace. In the Americas, Europe, Korea, and Taiwan, players who purchase a WoW Token from the Auction House will be able to redeem it for 30 days of game time.
Going for Gold
Because the Token exchange has to start somewhere, we will be setting the initial gold value of the WoW Token ourselves. The starting gold value in each region will be based on several factors, including regional in-game economies, but ultimately our goal is to select a fair and reasonable starting price. After that, the Token's gold value will be determined dynamically based primarily on player supply and demand. Simply put, if more WoW Tokens are being listed than are being purchased, the price will automatically drift downward over time. If people are purchasing Tokens from the Auction House faster than they're being put up for sale, then prices will go up accordingly. As a reminder, to help make sure players can trade WoW Tokens confidently, once a Token sells, the seller will receive the amount of gold they were quoted at the time they listed their Token.
The Point marks the 21 days to go to referendum day with a magnificent seven appeals to undecided voters from both rank-and-file activists and leading figures in the YES movement.

People say ‘why take the risk? I agree. The most important debate our country has faced is full of unknowns. So what do we know?
We know that if you vote no all the unionist parties are committed to continuing the austerity programme and we know that 60% of the cuts are still to come.
We know the Labour Party are committed to 96% of those cuts, however, plan new further ‘benefits attacks' on the under 25s. After all it was Alastair Darling who, in a rare moment of Blairite honesty, promised ‘deeper and tougher cuts than Thatcher'.
We know that the most vulnerable in our communities; the disabled, women and young children will feel the greatest effects of the austerity programme.
We know that the unionist parties will all replace the obscenity that is the Trident missile programme. We know that will cost over £100 billion and that £1.4billion has already been spent on the early design.
We know that, in the 4th most unequal country in the developed world, the unionist parties all voted to cap welfare payments.
We know that the three unionist parties are pandering to UKIP. Indeed Labour, desperate to lure ‘middle England', complained the recent Con/Dem Queen's Speech contained no immigration bill. That would perhaps seem surprising unless you recalled that it was Gordon Brown who uttered the shameful phrase “British jobs for British workers”.
We know that there is a very high chance that the much promised ‘in/out' referendum on membership of the European Union (EU) could result in the UK leaving.
We know that with the limited powers it has, the Scottish Parliament has built on our nation's broad social democratic consensus and delivered real social benefits. Benefits like free personal care for our older people, removing the worry for them, their families and communities about how they will be looked after. Benefits like free prescriptions, removing the ‘tax on sickness' and the obscenity of citizens presenting themselves to a pharmacist saying they can only afford two of the five items on the script, asking which two are most important. Benefits like free university education with access on the ability to learn rather than the ability to pay.
We know some people are concerned about the alleged challenges an independent Scotland would face such as currency and membership of the EU.
I'll declare I favour a separate Scottish currency, however, there is no doubt that, whether in the long-term or as a pragmatic temporary measure, sharing the pound is a viable option. Don't take my word for it, Alistair Darling and Blair MacDougall, leaders of Better Together and Professor Jim Gallagher one of their advisors are all on record supporting that approach. Currency is about trade and, as should be clear to all, trade takes place regardless of currency and perceived boundaries.
We hear a lot about ‘plan B'. It's a good question. What is Better Together's ‘plan B' when Tesco, Amazon and Starbucks tell them they want a single currency for Great Britain? This is all posturing by a failed state whose last two Chancellors, Alistair Darling and George Osborne have between them racked up an astonishing debt of £1.45 trillion. Those are not the kind of guys I'd recommend taking economic advice from!
I have a European Union passport now and will still have one under independence. The EU is an expansionist organisation and if Ukraine, with all the challenges is eligible for Membership, then does any credible voice suggest that Scotland wouldn't be admitted?
Then there's the ‘problem' of having vast oil reserves requires to be addressed too. ‘Investment will dry up', except it hasn't. Why would it? Corporate greed will ensure that the money will go where the profits can be harvested and the North Sea, with or without the mysterious Clare Ridge, is a rich source of profit.
So I've no doubt , with the necessary work, we can persuade our fellow residents that supporters of YES have a vision, indeed various visions, of a better future whilst those who encourage you to vote No have nothing to offer but threats and more of the same. I don't want more of the same under the UK and I most certainly don't want more of the same under an independent Scotland.
The growing inequality which is the hallmark of the UK must be replaced by a concerted programme to remove health, wealth, gender mobility and fuel inequalities.
The UK's National Health Service, once the jewel in the rich crown of public services, has now been singled out to be plundered by the millionaire politicians'' mates.
The position of the Labour Party in Scotland is entirely out of kilter with their colleagues in England and wales who rightly see the Health and Social Care Act as the death knell for a free NHS. Only independence can save the NHS.
So, which of the UK's four millionaire public schoolboys Party Leaders do you want to form your government 2015? Or, do you want to elect a government in 2016 to control all your affairs?
Hope over fear. Vision over greed. ‘A different Scotland can be ours' only if you vote ‘YES'!

A woman confronted Donald Trump's press secretary Sean Spicer when she saw him at an Apple Store in Washington, D.C. this weekend, asking him how it feels “to work for a fascist” while destroying the country.
“How does it feel to work for a fascist?” Shree Chauhan asked Spicer. “Have you helped with the Russia stuff? Are you a criminal as well? Have you committed treason, too, just like the president? What can you tell me about Russia? What can you tell me?”
“We have a great country,” a smiling Spicer responded. “Thank you. Such a great country that allows you to be here.”
Asking @PressSec questions in Apple Store since he doesn't like the press. https://t.co/l493z2gG4x — Shree (@shreec) March 11, 2017
Seconds later she approaches him again.
“You know you work for a fascist, right? You work for a fascist. How do you feel about that? How do you feel about destroying our country?”
In a post on Medium, Chauhan claims Spicer threatened her citizenship on camera.”
“That is racism and it is an implied threat,” she said of the “allows you to be here” remark. “Think about the sheer audacity of Mr. Spicer to say that to my face with a smile, knowing that he is being recorded on video and the position of power he holds in our government.”
“I was not polite. But when does being impolite mean that I should be thrown out of the United States of America? The country I was born in, the country I was raised in, the country I love despite its flaws.”
“I have spent enough time with online to encounter rabid Trump supporters. Many of these folks see my brown skin and question my citizenship. They question whether I am here legally. They tell me to leave the country. They have told me to go back to where I came from.”
Darksiders II's release date has been pushed back from June 29 to an unspecified day in August, THQ has announced.
"This is great news for the team at Vigil, because it allows additional time for polish and to ensure that all aspects of Darksiders II meet the high-quality bar the team is targeting," explained the publisher on the game's official website. "In game development, more time is always a good thing for quality and the Vigil team is dedicated to providing the definitive Darksiders experience."
A brief Q&A accompanied the announcement, including confirmation that the delay hasn't been made in order to launch simultaneously on Wii U, and that the game content and future DLC plans remain unchanged.
The exact street dates will be issued for each region in the days to come.
All pre-orders on Xbox 360, PS3 and PC will still receive a complimentary upgrade to the Limited Edition.
The Limited Edition includes the standard retail game, plus a code to download the game's first single-player DLC, Argul's Tomb, free of charge once it becomes available.
[video]11804[/video]
Interestingly, a comment made in the Q&A suggests that THQ's financial position isn't as perilous as some had reported.
"Nothing is more important to us than quality and thankfully our company's current operational position allows us to make the right choice for Darksiders II," explained the Q&A.
I wonder if the firm hadn't reported better than expected Q4 results, whether Darksiders II would have been afforded the extra development time.
Tyrone Crawford just dodged a major bullet.
The veteran Dallas Cowboys' pass rusher is entering a year in which he needs to prove he's worth his massive contract extension, having now undergone a second shoulder surgery in as many offseasons. Crawford entered training camp fully healthy and looking ready to dominate, but gave the team a serious scare when he was carted off the practice field on Tuesday in agony.
Thankfully for him and the team itself, the news came back positive and Crawford shouldn't miss any serious time.
This was ultimately confirmed by the Cowboys themselves shortly thereafter, who noted all X-rays came back negative on the ankle.
Confirming earlier reports, early diagnosis of Tyrone Crawford's injury is a lateral right ankle sprain; no fracture. — Rob Phillips (@robphillips3) August 9, 2017
The team is still awaiting MRI results to determine the extent of the sprain, but aren't expecting anything major at this point. And Crawford looks to be in great spirits, even politely asking everyone to stop reminding him of the injury by sending him the picture as a gruesome visual aid.
I want to thank everyone for the prayers????! I'll bounce back from this and will be out there putting in #WorkK soon! — Tyrone Crawford ???? (@TCrawford98) August 9, 2017

Michael Carrick has given Wayne Rooney the support of all Manchester United players by claiming that the unsettled striker is "one of us", with the midfielder making it clear that the squad are firmly behind him.
Rooney came on for the closing half hour of United's 4-1 win at Swansea City on Saturday evening to create both Robin van Persie and Danny Welbeck's second goals in the victory.
Despite Rooney unhappiness and his desire to leave the club, when he warmed up the travelling United support gave him a warm reception, applauding and chanting his name. Yet despite this the 27-year-old did not take part in the side's celebrations following the final goals of Van Persie and Welbeck to acknowledge fans at the close of the match.
Asked if he was glad to see Rooney come on as a substitute, Carrick said: "Yes. I thought he came on and looked good. He set up two goals and that's what he's all about. He's a real threat. He got a bit of a whack [on his Achilles] when he made Danny's second but I'm sure he'll be all right. He's a big Manchester United player. He's one of us and we all stick together.
"When we're on the pitch we fight for each other and do what we can for Wayne. He's certainly part of that."
Regarding the supporters' reaction, Carrick added: "He's given this club an awful lot so the fans support him and we support him. As I said, we stick together. It was a good day."
Phil Jones also hailed the fans' acknowledgment of Rooney. "That was great. He is a fantastic player and he did well when he came on. He came on and did the job. He did well. The manager and all the lads are pleased," said the defender.
Jones was unsure if Rooney was surprised to have received such greeting. "It's great but you'll have to ask him that question," he added. Rooney is yet to say anything publicly about his future though when asked to comment by reporters following the win he did smile to suggest that there is a desire to speak out at some point.
While Wilfried Bony scored Swansea's consolation on debut, Moyes stated that he hopes Welbeck can become a 20-goal a-season striker. "I think we're going to try and encourage him to be that and do everything we can to do so," said the manager.
Welbeck's double against the Swans means that in the opening game of the season he has already doubled his total league return of the last campaign. So what has been holding him back? "I think sometimes you need a run and a bit of confidence and getting the goals," said Moyes. "Sometimes you need to get into the right areas and maybe in the past he's not wanted to get right in to get his goals. That's why the first one - the pleasing bit is he was in for a ball that was played right across the six-yard box and he got himself a tap-in."
‘s front office peers around the NBA should pay close attention to the way the Toronto Raptors' star goes about his business. While some franchise architects like to work their so-called magic with the public watching intently, Ujiri has done a masterful job (first in Denver and now in Toronto) tweaking chemistry and getting results.
In fact, Ujiri has proven himself to be the ultimate chemistry teacher these days in terms of knowing how to tweak a roster just right. The reigning NBA Executive of the Year, an honor voted on by his peers, Ujiri is making a strong push for repeat honors with the way the Raptors are playing since the Rudy Gay trade went down.
They are 9-3 and winners of eight of their last 10 games since moving Gay to Sacramento Dec. 9. It was a move designed to give the Raptors long-term flexibility and not necessarily an immediate jolt that has helped them climb all the way up to the No. 4 spot in the Eastern Conference playoff chase.
But Ujiri has a way of studying a roster, figuring out what works and what doesn't and then being fearless in his attempts to change things for the better. Since Gay was jettisoned, the Raptors have scored huge wins over the likes of Dallas and Chicago, and most recently in Oklahoma City (where they handed the West-best Thunder their first home loss of the season) and kicked off 2014 with an impressive home win over the East-best Indiana Pacers.
As much as this is about the fine work being done by Raptors coach Dwane Casey and his staff, and of course, the contributions of a roster full of grinders like DeMar DeRozan, Kyle Lowry, Amir Johnson, Jonas Valanciunas, Terrence Ross, Greivis Vasquez and others, this is about the man who put it all together.
Ujiri just happens to have the magic touch right now. And if you don't believe it, just look at the hard times his former team has fallen upon in his absence. The Denver Nuggets have lost eight straight games, their longest such skid since the end of the 2002-03 season. Veteran point guard Andre Miller turned the heat up even more by ripping first-year coach Brian Shaw after Wednesday's loss to the Philadelphia 76ers, making matters worse in Denver while Ujiri has his new team soaring.
A boss like Ujiri keeps those dustups contained, as best can be, or at least at a minimum and away from the public. You don't have to worry about those sorts of altercations when working conditions are at a premium. And Ujiri has freed up virtually every key rotation player on the Raptors' roster to do what he does best after the Gay trade.
DeRozan and Lowry in particular are allowed to play more to their natural strengths on the perimeter, while Valanciunas has become more of a focal point as well. Role players like Johnson, the ridiculously underrated Vasquez, who came over from Sacramento in the trade, and young journeyman forwards Tyler Hansbrough and Patrick Patterson have become critical pieces in the Raptors' current run.
“No one on this team is selfish; everyone accepts their roles,” Patterson told reporters after the Raptors outslugged Paul George, Roy Hibbert and the Pacers to kick off the New Year. “No one wants to get more shots, no one wants to do more of this, no one is jealous of another player … we all understand what we have to do in order to make this machine keep rolling smoothly.”
The man responsible for making sure that machine runs without a hitch, of course, is Ujiri. He understands, as well or better than most right now, that team chemistry trumps just about everything else that goes on inside a team's fabric in this day and age. Even the Miami Heat needed a year (and a Finals defeat at the hands of a Mavericks team that had off the charts chemistry) to figure that out.

"The trouble with market research is that people don't think how they feel, they don't say what they think and they don't do what they say."
So said the late advertising don David Ogilvy, and his words get to the heart of what is still one of the biggest challenges in business: How can you tell if people really like what you are trying to sell them?
Technology offers an answer to the question that Ogilvy, who died in 1999, probably never envisaged.
Image caption Product testers are great at telling you exactly what you want to hear
Market researchers are already experimenting with desktop and smartphone applications that promise to reveal the subconscious layers of a consumer's brain.
What's more, because this technology can work automatically and in real-time, it could potentially be used to evaluate the emotional responses of millions of people before any product is released.
And, with one small caveat, this power could transform market research and indeed the whole world of business forever.
(Oh yes, the "small caveat": to go along with this, you must be prepared to believe that computers can decipher the intricacies of human emotion.)
Market failure
Old-fashioned market research is straightforward and unemotional: you get a sample of product testers and ask them what they think of a particular concept, product or brand.
But surveys and focus groups assume that people know what is going on inside their own heads - and that is a risky assumption.
"80% of new products brought to market fail, largely due to failures in traditional techniques", says Rob Stevens, co-founder of UK market research company Bunnyfoot.
"I can't think of any other area of business where such a failure rate would be considered acceptable, yet somehow, in market research, it is."
Lie to me
Mr Stevens likes to describe his company as a real-life version of The Lightman Group - the fictional agency in the TV series Lie to me starring Tim Roth.
Like Roth's character, Bunnyfoot's staff are trained to spot clues in the facial expressions of product testers, which betray their inner feelings - a process known as "facial coding".
They also use eye-tracking technology to monitor exactly where a person looks during a product test.
Though relatively old and low-tech (facial coding goes back to Charles Darwin), these techniques are capable of yielding business insights.
Image caption A product tester's facial expressions are filmed while they surf the Boden website
"When you ask a product tester if they spotted a particular feature on a webpage, they often tell you they did," says Mark Batty of online clothing retailer Boden.
"But when you look at the eye-tracking, you discover that they never saw it all."
Boden is in the middle of a usability study of its website, and as its e-commerce manager, Mark Batty has learned not to put much faith in testers' explicit responses.
"Often their verdict of the whole site depends on whatever task they did at the end of the test," he adds.
"If they enjoyed the final task they would be full of praise about the site, even if their facial expressions revealed that they had struggled with it at the beginning."
Look into my phone
The problem with manual techniques like facial coding is that they require a researcher to sit through hours of slow motion video, logging every mind-numbing frown and every humdrum movement of the pupils.
This means that studies are necessarily limited to a small sample of testers.
Boden's usability study, for example, had a sample of just 30 people across three countries.
Image caption A product tester's responses to a TV advert are automatically decoded by ThirdSight's software
But this obstacle could soon be removed, by allowing computers to do most of the donkey work.
"Facial expressions can be read by a computer - it's just the movement of pixels in a piece of video," says Dr Roberto Valenti of the University of Amsterdam.
Dr Valenti and his colleague Dr Theo Gevers are so convinced of computerised emotion recognition that they set up a spin-off company called ThirdSight to cash in on it.
"A researcher gets tired, they need to be paid, they need to be trained."
Image caption A smartphone monitors and decodes a person's facial expressions as either "positive" or "negative"
"But our software never gets tired and it can analyse thousands and thousands of faces at the same time."
ThirdSight's latest achievement is to get automatic facial coding software running on a smartphone, using the phone's inbuilt camera to record a product tester's expressions.
Machine learning
Of course, all of this hinges on the accuracy of the software.
And so far, Thirdsight's claims of accuracy are relatively humble.
They acknowledge that you still need a human researcher to oversee the software, because it is oblivious to context or hidden meanings - it will treat both a happy smile and a bewildered smile as "positive".
But other scientists are less conservative.
"We can normally tell between different emotions with pretty high accuracy," says Professor Peter Robinson of the Computer Laboratory at Cambridge University.
"Our computers can get an accuracy of two-thirds or better - which is about as well as most people can do it."
Prof Robinson's team is trying to free up emotion recognition software from simple rules, such as smile = happy.
Instead, they're programming it to digest many types of human expression - facial and eye movements, hand and body gestures, the tone of the voice.
Image caption Professor Peter Robinson says his emotion recognition software can be just as accurate as a human
Through a technique called "statistical machine learning", the software then trains itself to recognise which indicators are important and which are not.
If this kind of power and accuracy could be incorporated into a ThirdSight-style smartphone or internet app, then potentially millions of people's emotions could be accurately decoded.
"If you do an experiment on Facebook, you've got half a billion people in your sample," says Prof Robinson.
"That means the statistics become rather bizarre, actually, because you are sampling almost an entire population to get a result."
So, theoretically at least, the day may come when no product is doomed to flop - because businesses will have access to almost complete certainty about their market.
Although legalization of recreation marijuana did not pass in California in 2010, Robin Abcarian, with the LA Times writes that marijuana is barely labeled as a "gateway drug" anymore, and you hardly find anyone saying it's evil. Hence he believes that recreational use of marijuana will be legalized when it goes up for ballot in November.
Nearly two-thirds of California voters support legalization of marijuana for recreational use, according to a poll released on Wednesday by the Institute of Governmental Studies at UC Berkeley. From June 29 to July 18, 2016, 3,020 people were surveyed in this poll.
One of the arguments against legalization is that patients in California can be prescribed to treat practically any ailment. Therefore, according to such opposition, legalization for recreational use isn't required.
Further, in 2011, California made possession of up to one ounce of marijuana a minor offense that is only as bad as a parking ticket.
However, the Drug Policy Alliance released a report finding that almost half a million people were arrested in connection with marijuana related charges in the last 10 years. Almost 9,000 people were arrested on marijuana-related felonies in 2015 alone.
"Black, Latino, and white people use and sell marijuana at similar rates, yet black and Latino people are more likely to be arrested for a marijuana law violation," according to the report's press release. "Black people were more than twice as likely as white people to be arrested for marijuana misdemeanors and nearly five times more likely than white people to be arrested for marijuana felonies. Latinos are 35 percent more likely than white people to be arrested for a marijuana offense: 45 percent more likely for a misdemeanor and 26 percent more likely for a felony."
In addition, arrests of people under 18 for marijuana misdemeanors almost tripled in 2015 when compared to the time period before 2011 - when the charge for personal use possession was dropped to a misdemeanor.
Thousands of people are still being arrested for misdemeanor possession charges, giving away marijuana to other people, or possessing more than an ounce of marijuana.
Upon passing marijuana legalization, possession of marijuana concentrates, giving away minor quantities of marijuana would all be legal. People will also be able to grow up to six marijuana plants in their homes (which is now a felony). And plants can be sold and taxed like in Colorado.
In February, the Denver Post reported that in 2015 legal sales of marijuana in Colorado hit $996,184,788.
"Colorado also collected more than $135 million in marijuana taxes and fees in 2015 -- more than $35 million of which is earmarked for school construction projects," The Denver Post reports.
With a population that is almost eight times larger than Colorado, California's Department of Finance director Michael Cohen and legislative analyst Mac Taylor reported that California can potentially collect over $1 billion in tax revenue yearly if marijuana legalization passes.
Dangerous commutes aren't necessarily the ones where you are in a hurry and riding faster than you should, but rather the ones where you relax and cruise along with the flow of traffic.
You will notice the italicized slightly in the above paragraph because blasting through traffic too fast will get you cited, and it should because big speed in heavy traffic areas is a leading cause of our deaths. I'm writing about moving gently but consistently through traffic during commutes or heavy freeway traffic, always pushing forward and rarely if ever riding along in the flow of traffic.
Few of us need to be reminded of the generally poor driver training most car drivers have undergone, and when you decide to hang around in the same general vicinity of these drivers, their poor training and decision making become immediately obvious. These “mellow” days taught me a lesson and I'll put it this way: Go Rider Go.
The most dangerous days were days when I thought: I'm gonna be mellow today and just cruise along, go with the flow, take it easy. Those were the days I almost got hit. The decision to take it easy often came after a speeding ticket or after we (the speed-addled magazine staffers) had been stretching time and space, but that decision put me right in the middle of traffic and at their pace.
Ask the general public and they'll equate “dangerous” with fast and too much speed and aggression, so when I write “dangerous commutes,” some will think they happened on the days I was late and rushed and hurried. But in fact, the most dangerous days were just the opposite.
For thirteen years I worked full-time for Petersen Publishing Company and commuted by motorcycle into Hollywood, California, from the San Fernando Valley in what can be described as “insanely heavy traffic.” Though I'm no longer in California, I still ride and drive in heavy traffic occasionally, and last week in the middle of Las Vegas rush hour I was reminded of the most dangerous commutes from the magazine era.
Being aggressive on the street means jumping through blind spots and being in command of the situation. The fact is, you can't you always trust a driver to see you in his or her mirror.
You are the aggressor because it allows you to be in better command of the situation. You are acting upon the other cars, rather than them acting upon you. You are jumping through blind spots rather than riding in them. And you are less worried about cars approaching from your rear because you are moving slightly faster than most of the traffic, which allows the majority of your focus to be on your next move ahead of you, rather than a car's next move as it approaches you from behind. Don't be in a position of hoping distracted and poorly trained drivers will pilot their way around you. Please take a share of my cynicism on the subject of driver performance and don't be around when the mistakes are committed.
Some interesting things will happen when you do. You will find pockets in the traffic where you have no one around you and you will sit and enjoy these pockets. As the pockets close, you will move forward again. Your friends will notice that you ride at the flow of traffic when there's nobody near you, but slightly increase your pace as cars come close. You will begin to drive your car like this too, and be safer for it.
Your riding will become less reactive because you aren't just sitting there hoping everyone sees you and makes good decisions around you. You will be approaching traffic from behind and judging the vehicles, imagining what they might do and where they're going to be in a few seconds. You will be more in control of your future because you're helping to create it, not just let it roll over you. Literally.
One last example to help you understand the mindset: Last month I booked a shuttle from the airport to my parent's house, and the driver's habits had me squirming in my seat. His top priority in the fast-moving traffic was the speed limit, and cars and trucks flowed past us left and right.
His adherence to the speed limit constantly placed us in awkward positions as he peered in his mirror looking for an opening, or got dive-bombed by someone exiting or entering the freeway. I was scared. We were forfeiting control of our health to others because they were catching and passing us, making decisions on following distances and passing tolerances. I like it the other way around and encourage you to match a successful rider's defensive techniques with enough aggression to have you move smoothly through traffic. Go Rider, Go.

Facebook, which has long relied on other people to provide it with content, is going to start paying for its own stuff, too.
Facebook is starting to talk to TV studios and other video producers about licensing shows, with the hope of boosting the social network's video efforts.
The talks, which include discussions for scripted shows, game shows and sports, are being led by Ricky Van Veen, the College Humor co-founder who joined the company earlier this year.
The talks seem similar to Facebook's attempt to boost live video earlier this year, when it struck deals with various publishers, including Vox Media, to produce live content exclusively for the company.
Some of those livestreaming deals are for more than $1 million a year, but they're nowhere near what traditional TV networks or streaming services pay for top-tier programming. People familiar with Facebook's new talks say it seems more interested in experimenting with different formats, but hasn't committed to big-ticket investments like Netflix and Amazon have made for original shows and movies.
Here's a statement from Van Veen about his efforts:
“Earlier this year, we started rolling out the Video tab, a dedicated place for video on Facebook. Our goal is to kickstart an ecosystem of partner content for the tab, so we're exploring funding some seed video content, including original and licensed scripted, unscripted, and sports content, that takes advantage of mobile and the social interaction unique to Facebook. Our goal is to show people what is possible on the platform and learn as we continue to work with video partners around the world.”
Facebook's moves to acquire its own content shouldn't be a shock. As we wrote earlier this year:
“Facebook won't say this, but it's reasonable to assume that at some point Van Veen and his new boss, Facebook content VP Nick Grudin, could also decide that Facebook might want to back/invest in specific pieces of content, instead of just sending money to content makers and letting them do what they want with it.”
But it's still a significant step for Facebook, which has insisted, over and over, that it is a tech company, not a media company.
Up until this year, Facebook could at least argue that it only provided a platform for other media companies and wasn't in the content business itself. But that changed earlier this year when it started writing checks to companies that gave it livestreams, and now it's changing again as it experiments with more video.
People who have talked to Facebook about original projects say they don't believe the company has a specific funding target or program, as YouTube did when it tried to seed original content five years ago. Instead, it has seemed like an ad hoc discussion. But Facebook's public announcement that it wants to pay for stuff may signal a more formal program.
Facebook is already full of video, as it has aggressively moved into the format over the past two years. But it remains unclear how content owners will make money from the stuff they upload into Facebook.
The company doesn't allow for traditional “pre-roll” ads, which are common throughout the web, and it only recently allowed video producers to integrate advertisers into their programming via “branded content” shows. That tactic has worked well for a handful of companies, including BuzzFeed, whose “Tasty” recipe franchise has proven to be very advertiser-friendly.
But many other video producers, including most major sports leagues, have been reluctant to put their most lucrative stuff on Facebook without getting a return.

A Washington state legislator has channeled his inner
From A Washington state lawmaker looking to ease traffic congestion for several Puget Sound-area communities near Seattle has proposed building an eye-catching new toll bridge made from retired Navy aircraft carriers. It would involve at least two—although possibly many more—aircraft carriers laid "end to end" to cross a local stretch of water known as the Sinclair Inlet.
"This would definitely be a unique way to tackle some of those problems," the representative stated to the AP, "but at the same time it would serve as a floating memorial to veterans and the sacrifice they have given to our country."

Just think of the epic possibilities here for pedestrian paths, interstitial business opportunities, weird spaces for physical fitness, peripheral plazas and decks available for private events, and new public park space.
Perhaps even, deep in the labyrinth of the old ships' underbellies, you could open a restaurant, a bookstore, a cinema. A SCUBA academy. An architecture schools.
It would be like a return to the inhabited bridges of an earlier age —

—only gunmetal grey and prickly with artillery, like a surreal hybridization of Constant's New Babylon and the U.S. Navy.

Of course, this isn't exactly a real plan—it's more of a casual remark by a state politician. No feasible studies, environmental reviews, or financial plans have yet been put in place, for example (although apparently one is in the works), and I personally doubt that such a thing could ever see the light of day.
But here's to weird architectural visions popping up in unexpected contexts—and to the future civilian reuse of discarded military equipment, even (or especially) in spectacular urban ways such as this.

VFX supervisor and Motion Graphic designer Fede Ponce has worked on main title designs for Marvel's The Avengers and Thor: The Dark World, but what caught my eye is the various designs he produced for Jon Favreau's Iron Man, which starred Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark.
Film Sketchr recently interviewed Ponce and inquired about those logo designs. "We go through a lot of iterations and concepts when designing. For this particular case, I had read the script and was able to grasp what the director wanted to talk about in this movie," Ponce told Film Sketchr. "The movie in essence is about redemption, about being broken and being re-born. So the main title had all those elements in it."
Check out the alternate Iron Man logos in the images below.
After surviving an unexpected attack in enemy territory, jet-setting industrialist Tony Stark builds a high-tech suit of armor and vows to protect the world as Iron Man. Straight from the pages of the legendary comic book, Iron Man is a hero who is built - not born - to be unlike any other.
15th episode of the third season of House
"Half-Wit" is the fifteenth episode of the third season of House and premiered on the FOX network on March 6, 2007. Grammy-winning singer/songwriter Dave Matthews guest stars in the episode as Patrick, a savant and piano prodigy who comes under the care of Dr. House (Hugh Laurie) for a rare movement disorder. Dr. House also is suspected to have cancer by his staff. Also appearing is Kurtwood Smith. The episode marks the directorial debut of executive producer Katie Jacobs.
Plot [ edit ]
Patrick Obyedkov (Dave Matthews), a respected pianist, is in the middle of playing a piano concert when he suffers a painful involuntary muscle contraction in his left hand. After Patrick is admitted to Princeton-Plainsboro Hospital, his case attracts the attention of House. House learns from Patrick's father (Kurtwood Smith) that Patrick suffered severe brain damage when he was in the 4th grade from a bus accident that also killed his mother. House is intrigued as to why Patrick, who had no musical training at the time of the accident, could suddenly play the piano flawlessly after suffering a severe injury.
He pushes for further testing on Patrick's brain even though the team has diagnosed him with a simple muscle-contraction problem. While trying to deduce the origin of the brain rewiring responsible for Patrick's mysterious gift of music, House and his team must stop the deadly bleeding that is quickly threatening his life. Patrick's condition worsens as he suffers an onset of seizures and as the team stabilizes him with House's diagnosis, House presents a very difficult option to Patrick's father, either to perform a hemispherectomy, a neurological procedure where the right half of Patrick's brain would be removed, allowing Patrick to live normally but not play the piano, or to continue as he is and never live a normal life.
Patrick's father, needing to make a decision asks him whether he is happy. Patrick answers repeating the question back, a defense mechanism indicating that he did not even understand the question. His father opts for the surgery. After the procedure, Patrick loses his ability to speak, though House says this will return. While the father is talking with House about his son's recovery, Patrick buttons his shirt, a task which he had previously been incapable of doing, which leaves him smiling and his father astonished.
Meanwhile, Cameron (Jennifer Morrison) discovers that House has been in contact with a hospital in Massachusetts and suspects that House may be looking to take a new job there. When Cuddy (Lisa Edelstein) contacts the hospital, she learns that House has been in contact with a brain cancer specialist — not as a job applicant, but as a patient for a clinical trial. When confronted by his team, House denies the gravity of the situation and resents their interference, and they are forced to contend with the possibility his condition may be more serious than he's letting on. Cameron stages a kiss with House in an attempt to distract him while drawing blood, but he catches her.
Near the end of the episode, the team diagnoses that House does not have cancer, but a gumma. However, House reveals that the medical file sent to the hospital in Massachusetts was not his and he intended to trick the doctors at the university into implanting a "cool drug" into the pleasure center of his brain, possibly in order to get over the pain in his leg. At the end of the episode, House is walking home, and on the way sees Cameron, Chase, and Foreman sitting and ordering at a restaurant. After a few seconds of deciding, while in a dilemma, House enters the restaurant.
Awards [ edit ]
This episode was submitted for consideration in the categories of "Outstanding Drama Series", "Outstanding Writing in a Drama Series" and "Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series" on Hugh Laurie's behalf for the 59th Primetime Emmy Awards.[1] This resulted in nominations in the categories of Outstanding Drama Series and Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series.[2]
Music [ edit ]
Patrick begins to play the Waldstein Sonata by Beethoven (1st Movement) at the piano recital, in the opening scene.
As a test of Patrick's musical recall, House wheels a piano into his room and plays the opening bars of "I Don't Like Mondays" by the Boomtown Rats. Patrick plays them back note for note as House adds the hand-claps at the right moments.
During the MRT, the third movement of George Bizet's Symphony in C major is being played.
When Patrick was asked to pretend that his leg was a piano, he played the 3rd movement of the Waldstein Sonata.
In the end of the episode, House walks by a restaurant with the music "See the World" by Gomez playing.
Washington • Congress is pushing back on an Interior Department proposal to more than double entrance fees at some national parks during peak times and could look at legislation to halt any increases.
Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke says the proposed pilot project — which would affect four of Utah's five national parks — is aimed at raising money to chip away at the estimated $11.3 billion maintenance backlog at parks across the country.
The cost at peak times to enter Arches, Bryce Canyon, Canyonlands and Zion national parks would be $70 a car under the proposal unveiled last month. Parks now charge between $25 and $30 per car, depending on the park. Capitol Reef was not part of the pilot-project blueprint.
Zinke says the new rates proposed are still affordable and only being suggested for parks with a high volume of visitors.
“ The greatest bargain of the U.S. is our parks,” Zinke said in an interview. “Even at $70 per car load — which is a multiple-day pass — it's cheaper than taking a family to a movie.”
Parks are in desperate need of maintenance work, he added, with much of that backlog in road maintenance and repairs. Utah's share of the backlog is estimated at $278 million, including $62 million at Zion National Park alone.
“ Our parks are being loved to death,” Zinke said.
The Interior secretary noted that he'd like to work with Congress to change the fee structure to allow more money to stay in the park where the user fee is collected. By law now, 80 percent of the fee remains at the park while 20 percent goes to the entire system. About a fourth of parks charges a fee.
Zinke said he wants to see how the public reacts to the proposal — the comment period ends next week — and will reassess then.
“ Ultimately, we work for the public,” he said, “so we want to work with the public and see what they think.”
Congress may step in first.
Rep. Rob Bishop, a Utah Republican and chairman of the House Natural Resources Committee, which has jurisdiction over the Interior Department, says he will hold hearings on the park-fee proposal and look at legislation to prohibit an agency from raising fees without consulting Congress.
“ It is very difficult to allow an agency to raise money by itself,” Bishop said. “That's troublesome to me. Raising fees should have congressional input.”
Rep. Mia Love, R-Utah, is also pushing back, arguing that the fee increases would hurt Utah families and the Interior Department should be looking to charge international tourists more money than Americans who own the system.
“ It makes absolutely no sense,” Love said of the fee proposal. “We want to be able to enjoy the beauty of the landscape. It's very difficult for a family to go from, at Zion, $25 a car to $70 or more.”
She noted the opposition isn't partisan — Rep. Kyrsten Sinema , D-Ariz., has also blasted the proposal — and although Love supports most of Zinke's efforts at the Interior Department, she said, “I've got to fight him on this.”
I'm sure you've heard the buzz by now that when we debut the new enhancements to the Disney Wonder this fall, we're also premiering a brand-new stage show in the Walt Disney Theatre. “Frozen, A Musical Spectacular” is based on the Walt Disney Animation Studios “Frozen,” which is the number one animated feature of all time.
So what does it take to turn a blockbuster into a stage musical spectacular? We assembled a team of distinguished creative talent with Broadway credits and theatrical accolades, who you'll hear from in this video on the making of “Frozen, A Musical Spectacular.” Take a look…
Aboard the Disney Wonder the 977-seat Walt Disney Theatre provides the perfect setting to immerse audiences in the kingdom of Arendelle and showcase the film's renowned score. Songs like “For the First Time in Forever” and “Love is an Open Door” will be expanded into ensemble pieces, and the film's wintry wizardry will be realized in lavish production numbers of “In Summer” and “Fixer Upper.”
The production features the popular music and lyrics by the creators of the “Frozen” film score, Kristen Anderson-Lopez and Robert Lopez, and is adapted from the screenplay by four-time Tony Award nominee Chad Beguelin (“Gotta Dance,” “Aladdin,” “The Wedding Singer,” “Elf”).
Tell me, what excites you most about seeing this incredible story come to life onboard the Disney Wonder?
"You're all puppets, tangled in strings…strings.”
The much anticipated Marvel's Avengers: Age of Ultron will soon hit theatres worldwide, Hot Toys is excited to continue the waves of highly detailed and movie accurate collectible figures from this super blockbuster.

Well, they'll only eat you if you're a tasty insect. A few years ago, wildlife photographer Jeff Cremer was traipsing about the Peruvian rainforest when he noticed some glowing green dots scattered in the dirt. He returned to investigate with some entomologists.
After checking the dots out, the scientists suspect they're clicked beetle larvae.
Cremer returned to Refugio Amazonas in the Tambopata rainforest earlier this year with entomologist Aaron Pomerantz and University of Florida graduate students Mike Bentley and Geoff Gallice to see what they could uncover about this mysterious green glower.

Bioluminescence can evolve for any number of reasons, but the orientation of these small critters - their mandibles sticking straight up out of the dirt - suggested that they might use their light to lure in prey. Like moths to a flame or to your porch light, the idea is that their prey might be attracted to the glowing green dots. Then when an insect comes close enough...CHOMP!
To verify their predatory nature, the entomologists did a fairly obvious test: they put an ant on the end of a stick, and then presented it to the larvae. "Sure enough they were voracious, clamping their mandibles shut and dragging their prey into the tunnels...never to be seen again," explains Pomerantz on the Rainforest Expeditions blog.

But what are they, exactly? It's still an open question.
We believe these belong to a family of beetles called Elateridae, which are commonly known as click beetles. But beyond that, we are not entirely sure what species this is or if it has been described yet (perhaps through the power of the internet we can get an answer). Elateridae is a very large family with around 10,000 described species in the world and only about 200 species have been documented to display bioluminescence. Some species of glowing beetle larvae in Brazil can be found in old termite nests where they attract and catch prey like ants and termites. The behavior that we observed where the larvae had utilized a dirt wall, as opposed to a termite mound, for their home and hunting ground could be a different niche not yet documented for this enigmatic group of glow worms.

It's amazing that you can find critters unknown to science simply by keeping your eyes open on an evening walk through the rainforest.

The wireless industry is nothing if not competitive, but for T-Mobile CFO, Braxton Carter, it's a challenge he welcomes. Coming in as the third most profitable of all carriers, Braxton says the company has had a transformative few years despite the highly-saturated market. I sat down with Carter this month to discuss his long career in wireless, T-Mobile's journey and his role in it – according to him, it's far from over.
This interview has been edited and condensed.
Jeff Thomson: T-Mobile is undergoing a period of growth from acquisitions to expansion of coverage, all of which you'd played a hand in. What have been the most exciting and challenging aspects of these initiatives?
Braxton Carter: The entire T-Mobile U.S. turnaround story has been an incredible opportunity and frankly one of the most exciting transformations of my career. Prior to the business combination with MetroPCS, T-Mobile was extremely challenged after a failed merger attempt with AT&T – the Company was suffering significant losses in subscribers, revenue and cash flow as a result. The business combination of T-Mobile and MetroPCS in May 2013 was a huge opportunity for the newly invigorated leadership team to turn around the business while reshaping the entire wireless industry. T-Mobile transformed into a growth platform with the Un-carrier revolution which translated into double-digit growth in revenues (and resulting significant cash flow development) in a highly competitive and mature industry. The journey is far from over, but it's been an unbelievable ride thus far!
Thomson: As the CFO of a prominent wireless company working in a highly-saturated market, how do you ensure T-Mobile remains financially competitive?
Carter: We have to stay laser focused on scaling the business, maintaining financial discipline and continuing targeted investing in our network to support our continued growth. After the business combination, it was mission critical for T-Mobile to obtain scale if we wanted to transition into a growth company which has a disproportionate impact to cash flow generation and margin expansion due to the high fixed-cost nature of this business.
We began with a solid foundation which included significant investments to improve our network and a highly innovative marketing approach to differentiate against a duopolistic industry structure that lacked any real change over the past two decades. T-Mobile evolved from the 4th largest to now the 3rd largest wireless company in a highly saturated and capital intensive industry – an accomplishment we are very proud of.
Thomson: You have a long history of working in wireless, namely with MetroPCS as its CFO from 2005 to 2011. What about the wireless industry is most compelling to you from a CFO/financial perspective?
Carter: My days in wireless date back past MetroPCS even! I began my career in wireless during the mid-90's at PrimeCo which was eventually consolidated into Verizon Wireless. The wireless industry is incredibly compelling as it moves very fast and our business is powering these mobile devices that have revolutionized the way everyone lives, works and plays. That isn't going to stop either. As content is moving to the internet…and the internet is moving to mobile, the universe of connected and mobile devices is just going to get more and more compelling. T-Mobile is in a unique position to accelerate and enable these phenomena. It's a fascinating time to be in wireless!
Thomson: In your opinion, what is the future of the wireless industry? Similarly, what does the future look like for T-Mobile?
Carter: The wireless industry has an incredible future. Look at how mobile devices are used today – for everything! And look at the increase in data consumption on those devices – the growth rates are unbelievable and the potential convergence of the internet and cable broadband to form a truly ubiquitous mobility environment will be at the center of the future of wireless. As I've said before, T-Mobile is uniquely positioned to be at the center of this transformation given our agility and leadership in innovation. We are in a great position.
Thomson: You were recently ranked #2 in ExecRank's annual list of Top Chief Financial Officers. What do you feel has contributed to your success as CFO and what advice would you give someone new to the CFO position?
Carter: Any successful CFO must first build a world-class team – no one can do it on their own! That is a really important first step. One thing that I feel has personally contributed to my own success is spending a significant period of time outside of finance and in the core operations of the business. Doing this will broaden anyone's perspective, further career development, and uniquely position you to be a true business partner and contributor. It's a time in my career I often reflect back to and highly recommend to others.
UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - Russia on Friday criticized an international investigation into the downing of a Malaysia Airlines plane in Ukraine, saying it can be transparent only with more U.N. involvement, even though the world body found the inquiry met international standards.

The U.N. Security Council met, at the request of Russia, to discuss a preliminary Dutch Safety Board report that said flight MH17 crashed due to a “large number of high-energy objects” penetrating the fuselage. The conclusion supported a theory that the plane had been shot down by a ground-based missile.
“The preliminary report of the DSB (Dutch Safety Board) is not very informative and doesn't contain convincing information about the circumstances of the crash,” Russia's U.N. Ambassador Vitaly Churkin told the 15-member council.
He said Moscow believed a transparent and objective investigation could be carried out only “with the help and participation in the investigation of the U.N.,” suggesting that a U.N. envoy and assistance mission should be considered.
The jetliner crashed in Ukraine in pro-Russian rebel-held territory on July 17, killing 298 people, two-thirds of them from the Netherlands. Ukraine and Western countries accuse the rebels of shooting it down with a Russian-made missile.
Russia has rejected accusations it supplied the rebels with SA-11 Buk anti-aircraft missile systems.
“Russia made clear its real intention is not to learn about the investigation, but to discredit it,” U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Samantha Power told the council.
“Russia is fighting in Ukraine. Russia has provided artillery and surface-to-air missiles to separatists in Ukraine. It has trained separatists on those surface-to-air missiles. It has moved troops into Ukraine. Russia has no standing to offer advice on this investigation,” she said.
Churkin rejected accusations that Russia was attempting to disparage the investigation. He told reporters on his way into the council that such claims were “unwarranted and provocative.”
U.N. political affairs chief Jeffrey Feltman briefed the council on the preliminary results of the Dutch-led inquiry.
“The United Nations is confident that the Dutch-led international investigation has been conducted in accordance with Annex 13 to the Convention on International Civil Aviation Aircraft Accident and Incident Investigation,” he said, referring to a international standard for such inquiries.
On July 21, the Security Council adopted a resolution that demanded armed rebel groups allow “safe, secure, full and unrestricted access” to the crash site and that those responsible “be held to account and that all states cooperate fully with efforts to establish accountability.”
Although a small number of Malaysian inspectors and Dutch body recovery experts reached the site, fighting between the rebels and Ukrainian forces kept Dutch crash investigators away.
Feltman said a Sept. 5 ceasefire in eastern Ukraine was “largely holding” but “conditions are still not conducive for investigators to have full and unfettered access to the site.”
“The Secretary-General once again calls on all those with influence on the situation to exert it immediately so as to create a propitious security environment for investigators,” he said.
Meknes - Steve Maman has rescued more than 100 children from danger in Iraq in the past few months with the support of Canon Andrew White, a world-renowned humanitarian figure. In order to grow support for his mission, he registered on June 26, in Canada "The liberation of Christian and Yazidi children of Iraq (CYCI)" organization. “We can act now or we can remain spectators,” announced its President, Steven Mamn, a Moroccan-Canadian. “Take part in this humanitarian cause: Donate & Share!” he asks.

Could you tell us about your foundation in few words and the choice of Yazidis and Christians?
Steve Maman: On June 26, 2015 I created a nonprofit organization called “The liberation of Christian and Yazidi children of Iraq (CYCI)” to support my mission. Its goal is to negotiate the liberation of children held hostage and used a sex slaves in Mosul. We chose Christians and Yazidi because they are the ones held hostage after a fatwa authorized them to be used and sold as sex slaves for the benefit of ISIS (Daesh) combatants. I would have definitely added the Muslim children to my mission if they were part of this horror.
Does your foundation have other objectives?
Steve Maman: Our unique objective is to liberate as many children as possible. The project has been going on for 8 months now, and the role of this organization is to provide us, in our work, with donations. Until now, I had carried the project on my own and have moved multiple families out of harm's way.
What made you come up with the idea for this project?
Steve Maman: Well, I as a Moroccan Jew, I found this cause to engage in a true world responsibility. The Torah talks about two things: “Tikkun Olam,” repairing the world, and “Kiddouch Hashem,” to make God's presence respected. As a Jew, it was a way to make this world better through actions of goodness and kindness. The goal here is for children to come out alive from this horrible war.
There is no question of religion, race, or nationality being discussed here. There are innocent children that are powerless, caught in the crossfire. But worse, they are being exploited in the crossfire, as if that alone were not enough pain to endure. The exploitations are beyond understanding. Children beheaded, raped, beat, underfed, left to live in cages! Why? Because they are Christian or Yazidi, and therefore this does not constitute a sin in the eyes of Islamic law in the way ISIS interprets it. This is not Islam. I refuse to accept, as a Jew, that this is Islam. This is a deformation, a distortion of Islam. This has to be decried and it has to be fixed. The fixing starts with giving them a chance at life.
I need support. One year has gone by and it has been long enough for world leaders to react and plan a solution, yet we see little being done for those left behind at the mercy of ISIS.
The heroic Government of Canada, with its Prime Minister Stephen Harper,who has gone to Iraq and pledged nearly 140 million dollars in aid to the humanitarian cause, as well as sending Canadian troops, is sending a message to the world. I wish to see more world leaders unite forces in order to find a solution to end this.
May god bless my mission with world leaders being aware of what I do and of what can be done. My mission is centered on the ones who are held hostage. I refer tothe ones kept in cages being hurt, abused molested and raped. The ones I truly wish to help are praying to God after every rape that he ends their pain and humiliation. It is reported they wish they be killed rather than live with such a fate.
God give them the strength to hold on to life for a bit longer until I get to them, God willing.
How much is the amount you have collected until now?
Steve Maman: This is a question that I cannot answer and won't disclose. But things are moving very well. Jews have been incredibly supportive of the mission, the majority being Moroccan Jews.
How long do you expect this project to last?
Steve Maman: One year maximum is my estimate. I figured that Mosul will be taken back and carnage will befall these children if they are not freed prior.
Does it have supporters and other funders? If so, who are they?
Steve Maman: Yes, until now, I have been funding the project myself. I founded CYCI in order to raise funds. Jews can relate to this cause,since they lived a similar fate during the Holocaust at the hands of the Nazis. They can relate to what it is to be saved and liberated, therefore granted freedom. I cite Oskar Schindler or Sir Winton as examples. They inspired me to act and do what I am currently doing, but I am definitely a long way from attaining their results.
Which means of communication did you use to approach donors?
Steve Maman: We use Facebook to create awareness.
Are there well known personalities (in Morocco, perhaps) who support this project?
Steve Maman: From Morocco, nothing yet, but God willing my country shall surprise me.
The most important aid I currently have is Canon Andrew White. He is a world-respected humanitarian figure, with many world leaders openly supporting his foundation that assists refugees and the persecuted.
How did you get in touch with him?
Steve Maman: I met Canon Andrew White through Facebook. We became very close. He actually travelled to Montreal and stayed with us. We planned this mission. I was already involved with him 8 months ago when I saved two complete families and moved them to Ankara,amongst numerous other missions. I am currently renting them a house and providingfor all their needs in Ankara. Canon White admired my actions, as he knew the family well. This strengthened our bond.
How did Canon Andrew White help in your work?
Steve Maman: He is instrumental to my success. He has a platform in Kurdistan and in Jordan with camps for handling the children I liberate.
Have you made concrete achievements together?
Steve Maman: Together we have saved more than 102 children so far, and it increases every day. Canon Andrew White has nothing to do with the liberation aspect. He handles and provides support after they are liberated.
Do you have any facilities for rescuing children? Do you make any negotiations there?
Steve Maman: I will explain it this way: I have, on the ground in Iraq, someone I call a brother. He is an Iraqi Christian. He is my hero. He is a young soldier, decorated by the US army and by the Iraqi Government. He is connected to every possible figure inIraq (Sunni, Shiite and Kurd, as well as all factions).
There are some people that seek means to make money around this war. I exploit that to my advantage. Tribal leaders are very helpful.
We never meet ISIS. We never negotiate with ISIS.
For the first time a Canadian Sephardic delegation was formed to be given, as Radio Shalom journalist Charles Lugassy says, its “title of nobility”. In what context was your meeting with the government and its leader organized? For what reason did you meet the Prime Minister? Do you have concrete political support?
Steve Maman: Well, the agenda of the day was specifically to honor Sephardic Jews that are influential.
The delegation was made up of people that make a difference in our world, by Sephardic Jews of all origins. I was chosen for my involvement in this project and mission. It was part of a group of 27 people from Canada.
I met the politicians in a context where the first delegation of Sephardic Jews was invited to Ottawa in a historical context (Purim day). We were greeted witha lunch, a tour, and exchanges with ministers while the Prime Minister was reserved for a select 7 people.
Has the constitution of this delegation been helpful for example in the fight you lead to rescue child victims of ISIS?
Steve Maman: Not at all. There was no relation with the agenda of that day.
You give in your video on YouTube the example of the Jordanian pilot. What was its impact on your project?
Steve Maman: Yes, this moved me very deeply. I wanted to act and not remain a spectator. I basically looked at my watch, and noticed how many lives I could save if I were to sell what was on my wrist. The next morning, I decided I would help children out, using my contacts in Iraq.
What message do you want to send to the world?
Steve Maman: This project is directed by a Moroccan Jew that was born in a country where there is tolerance for all religions that permits them to express themselves openly.
Morocco should serve as an example to the world. I could be more proud to be born to such country. My Moroccan identity is what makes me who I am, someone who cares, who loves and gives to strangers. This character is typical of Moroccans. We are definitely givers. The land inspired us with love for others. The land made us who we are: in my case, a Moroccan Jew with an attachment to my land that is irreproachable. This is proven again through the generosity of Moroccan Jews who are clearly standing with me in my fight to save and liberate these innocent girls and women.
Thank you for sharing our mission.

“The United States government had said last year that the case threatened to financially destabilize the Palestinian government and harm the region.” Oh my, we can't have a “destabilized” “Palestinian” government. It might start lobbing rockets at Israeli civilians and calling for genocide on its TV channel!
“‘Free Pass for Terrorists' as US Court Cancels $654 Million Verdict Against PLO,” Associated Press, September 1, 2016:
The decision to cancel the verdict against the PLO provides “a free pass for terrorists” to kill Americans overseas, said an attorney for families of victims.
A U.S. appeals court on Wednesday tossed out a $654 million jury verdict against the Palestine Liberation Organization for terrorist attacks in the early 2000s in Israel that killed or wounded Americans, saying the U.S. courts lack jurisdiction because the attacks were random and not aimed at the United States.
The United States government had said last year that the case threatened to financially destabilize the Palestinian government and harm the region.
Wednesday's written decision by the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Manhattan said the attacks in 2002 and 2004 that killed 33 people and wounded hundreds more were “unquestionably horrific.” But the three-judge panel said they were fortuitous and “not expressly aimed at the United States.”
The decision, written by U.S. District Judge John G. Koeltl, who was sitting on the court temporarily, said offices maintained by the PLO and Palestinian Authority in Washington were used to promote the Palestinian cause in speeches and media appearances and to retain a lobbying firm. It said those purposes were insufficient to give U.S. courts jurisdiction over the groups for random attacks abroad.
“It's a very surprising ruling,” said Robert Tolchin, an attorney for families of Americans killed or injured in the attacks.
He said the decision provides “a free pass for terrorists” to kill Americans overseas. Lawyers, he added, were considering appeals options.
Gassan A. Baloul, an attorney for the Palestinian Authority and the Palestine Liberation Organization, said: “We are very gratified that the court fully accepted our clients' consistent position that the PA and the PLO are not subject to the jurisdiction of the United States courts in these matters.”
The ruling pertained to a February 2015 jury award of $218 million to Americans in a case that relied on the Anti-Terrorism Act, which allows victims of U.S.-designated foreign terrorist organizations to seek compensation for pain and suffering, loss of earnings and other hardship. The award was automatically tripled under the law….

Amazon just announced a multi-year agreement with HBO to offer that cable network's back-catalog of shows on Amazon Instant Video, free for Prime subscribers. That's not all, though; HBO GO, which offers not only archived content but also current programming to HBO subscribers, will arrive on Amazon Fire TV by year's end, the companies announced.
HBO GO was the one glaring omission in terms of third-party app support for the Fire TV when it was announced last month. The streaming service offers those who already subscribe to HBO via their cable or satellite provider access to the network's extensive archive of TV series', as well as original films, sports, miniseries and documentary programming. The current catalog is over 1,700 titles strong, which means Fire TV gains a lot of additional appeal, or at least more feature parity with some of its competitors, including Apple TV and Roku.
The deal with Amazon to offer HBO titles on the Instant video streaming library has about a three-year lag time, too, so the HBO GO offering offers those hungry for more current content a way to stay up to date. Amazon also seems to be planning to integrate HBO GO into Fire TV's unified voice search, so anything you have access to within will appear alongside Instant titles and stuff from other content providers on the platform. No firm date on its release has been announced yet, beyond the “target” of year's end.
Latest Intellectual Property Chapter Of TPP Agreement Leaked: Would Be A Disaster For Public Health
from the transparency-needed dept
Large brand-name drug firms want to use the TPP to impose rules throughout Asia that will raise prices on medicine purchases for consumers and governments, and be in effect for the next several decades. With billions at stake, Big Pharma wants the TPP to be a road map for rules that will govern Pacific Rim economies for the next several decades.
A U.S. proposal in the text – to provide long automatic monopolies for biotech drugs or biologics, which includes most new treatments for cancer – contradicts the policies included in recent White House budgets and if adopted would undermine key cost savings touted by the administration. The past budgets have included a specific pledge to shorten the same monopoly periods so as to reduce cost burdens on Medicare and Medicaid.
If the TPP is ratified with this U.S.-proposed provision included, Congress would be unable to reduce monopoly periods without risking significant penalties and investor-state arbitration.
Also new in the May 2014 text is a "drug company-friendly" version of the TRIPS agreement for compulsory licensing of vital drugs patents. This is a diminished version of the TRIPS agreement that was present in the 2013 text. In theory, by issuing a compulsory licence, a government can authorise cost-cutting generic competition with patented drugs, in exchange for royalty payments to the patent holder. It is a key tool to promote affordable access to medicines. The new exceptions are set out here and here, having deleted the option for "Other Use Without Authorisation of the Right Holder" in the August 2013 text. The current global norms for justifying exceptions to patents are set out in the TRIPS agreement under either Article 30 or 31. Article 30 is a 3-step test that is restrictive in what it grants exceptions for, and is open to interpretation with regards to procedures for doing these tests. Article 31 (referred to in the August 2013 text and now gone) is the one generally used on all compulsory licensing for HIV and cancer drugs. Whilst it is more restrictive, it is limited to cases where patent holders are paid, so as long as a drug qualifies (as most HIV and cancer drugs do) it is possible to get an exception to the patent held by big pharmaceutical companies, breaking big pharma's monopoly on life-saving drugs.
However, the new version of the text of the TPP IP Chapter has deleted the option to use this assessment procedure, requiring many judgement calls on aspects such as how this might "prejudice" the patent holder. This will mean that the procedure is more restrictive and open to interpretation, and therefore lobbying and manipulation. In short, the TPP will greatly reduce the ability for creating more affordable drugs to save more lives, and increase the pharmaceutical industry's ability to retain monopolies.
For greater certainty, a Party may not deny a patent solely on the basis that the product did not result in an enhanced efficacy of the known product when the applicant has set forth distinguishing features establishing that the invention is new, involves an inventive step, and is capable of industrial application.

Dear Reader, As you can imagine, more people are reading The Jerusalem Post than ever before. Nevertheless, traditional business models are no longer sustainable and high-quality publications, like ours, are being forced to look for new ways to keep going. Unlike many other news organizations, we have not put up a paywall. We want to keep our journalism open and accessible and be able to keep providing you with news and analysis from the frontlines of Israel, the Middle East and the Jewish World.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Wednesday called on the European Union to "cease pressuring and attacking Israel...which is the only true defense that Europe has against the rising tide of radical Islam."
The premier made the remarks as he was boarding his flight to the United Kingdom, where he is due to meet with his counterpart, David Cameron, at 10 Downing Street in London.
"We are ready to act together with Europe in Africa and other places to fight extremist Islam, but this requires a change in attitude," Netanyahu said. "This change will take time, but we will put it into practice."Netanyahu said that this issue will be "the focus" of his discussions with Cameron."We need to fight radical Islam not just within our borders, as we have been doing, but also within our territories," he said. "Once I return to Israel, I will hold an additional wrap-up meeting that will deal with reinforcing our security presence, bolstering enforcement of laws, instituting minimum penalties, destroying the homes of suicide bombers, and other steps that we are determined to carry out against anyone who tries to do us harm from within Israel.""My policy is one of zero tolerance of terrorism, and that is what we will do," Netanyahu said.Netanyahu on Monday told European Council President Donald Tusk that the EU must stop pressuring Israel to enter dangerous agreements that threaten the future of the Jewish state.Europe “seeks to unilaterally press Israel into agreements that will endanger our very existence and therefore your very defense,” Netanyahu publicly told visiting European Council President Donald Tusk prior to holding a private discussion with him.Netanyahu said he was glad to see Tusk both as a representative of the EU and as a personal friend.“I've known you for many years. You've been a great friend of Israel, of the Jewish people, and may I say of me personally,” Netanyahu told Tusk.“We welcome Europe," said Netanyahu, before quipping in an off-the-cuff remark, “Does Europe welcome Israel?”Netanyahu told Tusk he hoped that together they could find a way to improve relations between Israel and Europe.

Earlier this month, Xiaomi launched an Oreo beta program for the Mi A1 smartphone. Early reports indicated that the build makes the fingerprint reader faster, and the dual-SIM feature needs improvements.
And now, we have some more information related to the beta build. According to a new report, Xiaomi has enabled fast charging support in the build. So if you were disappointed with Mi A1's lack of fast charging out of the box, look out for the final Oreo release.
The report also notes that Oreo has made app loading much quicker and animations have improved as well (as in, they are much smoother now). Of course, all the standard Oreo goodies are present, including adaptive icons and PiP mode.
The Chinese company had promised that the final release will be out before end of this year, so the wait isn't long (assuming everything in beta testing goes fine).

We're very excited to tell you that Before the Storm's bonus episode “Farewell” will be releasing in early 2018 and in even more exciting news; Hannah Telle and Ashly Burch will be returning to play Max and Chloe! As you are all aware, Ashly has been working with the writing team at Deck Nine and we're ecstatic that she will be returning to play the role of young Chloe.
Rhianna DeVries has done a fantastic job for the voice and motion capture of 16 year old Chloe so far, bringing a little bit of herself to the role, just as Ashly had in the previous game. We are forever thankful to Rhianna for the work she has put into Before the Storm and she will continue to work with us for the motion capture of young Chloe in Farewell.
As a reminder, in the Deluxe Edition's exclusive bonus episode ‘Farewell' you will be playing as a young Max Caulfield and this may very well be the last time that you will get to see Max and Chloe together! Unfortunately as much as we'd like to, we can't say much more about it just now as the team is focused on completing the final stages of polish for episode three, the finale of Before the Storm.
MyTrinTrin, disaster in waiting
Prashant C Blocked Unblock Follow Jun 6, 2017
Update: The TrinTrin development team reached out to me, they have fixed the major issues discussed in this post. I'm working list of recommendations to make the service more secure for everyone
On Sunday June 4th, we Mysoreans got the India's first public bicycle sharing service. The project is the initiative of State Government and is being funded by the World Bank under its Global Environment grant. Everyone was excited, it received detailed coverage on the local and national television, and newspaper
Thousands of people signed for the services already. Even few of my friends signed up, against my advice, but why am I advising my friends not to sign up?
Back in April when I was browsing https://www.mytrintrin.com/ I stumbled upon javascript that exposed the huge security bug. Basically it allowed anyone to access their database where they store sensitive user information like Name, Phone number, address and identity documentation (Passport/Driving License/Aadhar) this puts every registered users at higher risk of identity theft.
The security on MyTrinTrin website/api is hilariously lousy, a curious school student can get away with personal information of everyone registered on the website/app
Here are the three major issues that I have noticed
Unsecured database, at some point the whole MongoDB (dev/testing) database was accessible to anyone, however this looks like it is fixed now, or is it? 🤔
2. Unsecured web APIs, if you're curious and know little bit of web development you can pretty much query all the records in their database. It's funny (or sad) that you can do that without registering on the website, again all the APIs are open and public
My user record
3. Web directory browsing, you don't make your mapped web directories publicly browsable, ever, when it contains the sensitive user information.
Users identity documents accessible to public
When I raised these concerns to MyTrinTrin development team back in April, they were extremely polite and calm, and promised these issues will be fixed in time for the launch. I believed them, but guess what nothing is changed all their website and apps still exposes its user's sensitive personal information
I hope this post brings spotlight on these issues and get fixed, I can't wait to ride around the city on those bikes 🚴
Where to Stream: Star Trek Beyond
More Options
The new Star Trek film franchise is packed with stars, in every definition of the word. There's one star, though, that shines just a wee bit brighter than all the others–and he doesn't sport severe bangs and pointy ears or have impossibly blue eyes (seriously, Chris Pine, wow). The secret weapon of J.J. Abrams' rebooted Star Trek universe… is Simon Pegg. While the new Trek cast blends together well, Pegg's Montgomery “Scotty” Scott is the ingredient that gives this concoction its kick. He's the MVP of a cast filled with very valuable performers. Star Trek Beyond–also co-written by Pegg–has beamed aboard streaming services like Hulu and Amazon Prime, and you need to check it out if you don't believe my Scotty hype.
When you think of classic Trek, the '60s series or the original film franchise, odds are the faces of William Shatner and Leonard Nimoy appear. Kirk and Spock, along with DeForest Kelley's Bones, formed the backbone of Trek for its first few decades. That trio's cool, collected, and cantankerous personalities sparked on screens big and small. Scotty, played with a rugged yet jovial charm by James Doohan, was there too, but he rarely stole focus (his best moment comes in 1986's The Voyage Home). Director J.J. Abrams recalibrated the core Trek trio into a quartet with his 2009 relaunch and 2013's Star Trek Into Darkness; he put Scotty, played with vim and vigor by Pegg, in a leading role.
Pegg doesn't pop up until minute 83 of Star Trek, and things really come alive when he finally shows up. He misses the crew being assembled, two attacks from evil Romulan Nero, and the destruction of Vulcan. Scotty's a total outsider, left abandoned on a remote Starfleet installation with very little to eat and one silent buddy (Deep Roy's Keenser). When a dejected Kirk (Pine) and time travel refugee Spock (Nimoy) stumbles into Scotty's installation, all he wants… is a sandwich.
Scotty's not great because he wants more than just a bean to eat; Scotty's great because this new iteration of the series turned him into the audience surrogate character. And Pegg is great because he takes what could be a thankless, exposition-filled role and injects it with a beautiful, fussy energy. Pegg's Scotty is all eye rolls, smirks, and waving arms as he navigates truly outrageous circumstances. While Spock (Zachary Quinto) grieves for Vulcan, Kirk stresses about keeping his crew safe, and Bones (Karl Urban) wonders which outer space threat will kill him first, Scotty, unburdened by dramatic weight, gets to worry about what we worry about: plans, food, safety, and our ride. Basically, he does exactly what I (and probably you) would do if they were dropped in the middle of a battle with a time-traveling villain or a hella aggressive Benedict Cumberbatch: I'd joke and scream about the terrifyingly high stakes too! This isn't just done for jokes, though. When Starfleet loads up the Enterprise with 72 mysterious missiles in Into Darkness, ones that puzzle the crap out of Scotty's instruments, he stands his ground and refuses to bring them on the ship. Scotty's not cranky because he's annoyed, he's cranky because he cares. He cares a lot. And he's strong enough to torpedo his career if he believes it will save lives.
Scotty isn't just a worrywart, like when he scolds Kirk for submerging the Enterprise under an alien ocean. He's a great character because he also gets to be a hero in every one of these movies. No, he's not the flashy hero with the phasers and fist fights (that's the domain of Captain James Tiberius Perfect Hair). Just like he's an everyman in panicked situations, he's an everyman in the way he saves the day. He uses his brains and engineering skills to pull off incredible stunts. He beams three people from two targets onto one platform (a feat he called “pretty good”), he went on a daring solo spy mission aboard the USS Vengeance that saved the entire Enterprise, and he came up with Beyond's “Sabotage” plan. Without Scotty, Kirk and Co. die in every movie. The great thing is, none of these moments strain the character's credibility; Pegg pays him as an exasperated genius, and all of those saves are right in line with who Scotty is.
And then there's the running.
Not since Baywatch has running been so crucial to a story.
Maybe running doesn't make sense in a time when people can hail each other on teeny combadges or beam around existence. Maybe running is a low-budget way of amping up tension. Maybe it's just fun to watch, and that's all we need to think about when we see characters barrel down the Enterprise's forever curved corridors. And of all the runners in Star Trek, no one runs like Scotty.
This goes back to that everyman bit: Scotty isn't fit. He's not ripped. He doesn't fight often (a well-placed headbutt in Into Darkness aside). When he runs down that crazy big hangar in Into Darkness, you can hear him huffing along. He's explicitly not an action star like Kirk, and Pegg plays him that way. Scotty does all the action stuff, heart-rate be damned, and it only makes him more admirable.
That brings me to Star Trek Beyond, Pegg's third outing as Scotty. The film, which I won't totally spoil just in case you're gonna catch it for the first time now that it's streaming, pairs Pegg up Sofia Boutella's alien scavenger/warrior Jaylah. Their dynamic is unique and it works because of who Scotty is, and who he's been built up to be. Jaylah's already stoic and cold, so she wouldn't have clicked with Spock. Kirk would have hit on her way too much, and Bones would have probably just stomped off and left her alone. Chekov (Anton Yelchin) is affable like Scotty, but doesn't command as much respect. Maybe Sulu (John Cho) or Uhura (Zoe Saldana) would have worked okay with her, but they're nowhere near as charming. This pairing just highlights what's special about Scotty: he's a little goofy and always in over his head, but he's also confident, steadfast, and resourceful.
Kirk's the hero we want to be, but Scotty's the hero we can be. And that's why Simon Pegg's Star Trek's now not-so-secret MVP.

Come away, O human child!
To the waters and the wild
With a faery, hand in hand,
For the world's more full of weeping than you can understand.
– The Stolen Child, WB Yeats
We are into the seventh day of a remarkably-tenacious high-pressure system, and once again tiny white clouds float lazily across the bright blue Sligo sky. This child's-drawing-made-real is reflected in the filmy water at my feet, where tendrils of waterlogged grey wool swirl and merge with the clouds in the perfect mirror image, torn and scattered every now and then by skittish water boatmen.
I am several days too late, but the tragedy unfolds before my eyes: a young lamb, not more than two weeks old, has fallen into a deep puddle in the peat bog, the sides far too high and steep for it to climb out. His mother, in a panic, jumps down after him and tries to nudge him aloft with her muzzle, but all she does is churn the narrow edges around the stinking water into a slick, sucking ooze. Weighed down by his filth-caked wool, the lamb cannot have endured more than a few hours of the exhausting struggle to escape, and his mother might have lasted a few days more before finally collapsing on top of him, pushing them both down into the quagmire. The distant buzzing of chainsaws, clearing forest in the Gleniff Horseshoe far below us, is mimicked cruelly by fat droning bluebottles as they crawl in the empty space where eyes once were.
It's sad, but I've stopped and stared for selfish reasons: the same sun that brought the unfortunate lamb here to drink glares violently down on me, and as I scrape the sweat from my forehead again with one hand, I reach behind my back with the other and wobble the contents of my hydration pack through the thin mesh fabric – I have maybe a pint of lemony electrolytes left, but the day isn't even half done, I'm already pissing yellow, and, with a corpse in every puddle, there certainly isn't any fresh water to refill with up here. Picturing the map in my head, I draw a new line that swings past a shop and the chance to resupply, but it trims about eight kilometres from my original intended route. “Thank god for that,” I mutter as I set off across the bog again, waving politely to another nearby ewe and her lamb as they gaze at me suspiciously.
*
What a difference a blue sky and a warm sun can make: the last time I was here, stumbling blindly through thick November fog and howling gale, and navigating my way compass-in-hand over muck and heather, slowly, by the occasional hint of a contour, there hadn't been much of the outing that would be considered enjoyable by most people; but today, with a panorama that extends for thirty kilometres in every direction, the heady scent rising from a sea of tiny wildflowers as they are crushed underfoot, and a double concerto of song thrush and bumblebee ringing heavily in the air, it is impossible not to grin from ear-to-ear.
A long, lazy, early-summer's day had allowed the time this morning for a full breakfast and a late start, and with a belly full of black pudding and scrambled eggs, I had been dropped off at the end of a tiny farm track, a tunnel through overhanging bramble and rose hip, as it winds its way up towards the south face of Benbulben, through a maze of bright yellow gorse and wool-strewn barbed wire. A single sign hanging over a gap in the fence politely requests that I piss off, and I am reminded that there have been questions over the access to Benbulben from this direction, but I believe that as long as you don't behave like a prick and have a little respect for your surroundings, people will generally let you get on with it.
A sweat-inducing warm-up of a steep 400m climb up an obvious wide gully drops us at the long plateau that leads west to the classic ship's prow shape of photographic fame, where I find two chaps dangling their legs over the edge and sunning themselves as they snigger at my running tights. After taking a moment to locate a few narrow-but-skiable couloirs for future reference, if only it would snow here a little more often, I retrace my steps east for a few minutes and then carry on to the flat, relatively anti-climactic true summit of Benbulben, before pressing on across the bog towards Slievemore, and the incredible cliffs of Annacoona. These refreshingly-airy, cave-pocked cliffs towering hundreds of metres over the Gleniff Horseshoe, and the long, wide saddle leading north to the shark's fin summit of Benwiskin, provide a jaw-droppingly beautiful view of the surrounding forests, rolling farmland, and scarred peat moors, the millpond-calm waters (today, at least) of Donegal Bay, and, hazy in the distance, Carrigan Head and Slieve League; and to the south and west, magnificent but foreboding, a litany of peaks and points scattered across the Dartry Mountains and my immediate future: Truskmore, Hangman's Hill, Keelogyboy, Leean. The day has barely even begun.
When I reach the top of Benwiskin, I creep towards the edge to get a good look down the terrifying drop of the sheer north face, and my balls shrink up into my stomach as I lose faith in the grip of my last-legs running shoes on the slick grass, with my toes poking through holes and the tread all but worn through. Ravens soar overhead and the wind buffets me impatiently, and I suddenly realise that despite having gone barely ten kilometres, I'm already starting to feel the strain a bit. It's a symptom of the same mistake I make every time I come here, I underestimate how much more difficult traveling over terrain with little-or-no established trail is, and it takes a great deal more time and energy to cover the same distance as it would back home on my familiar Alpine trails. I crawl back from the edge, grasping at clumps of sedge for poorly-chosen security, then I suck down an energy gel before picking my way gingerly down the steep north-east ridge to a brief but terribly-exciting downclimb on a short section of mossy rock, and over a few hundred metres of barbed wire hurdles to the comfort and safety of a sun-baked tarmac road which leads to the other side of the Gleniff Horseshoe, and the start of the second significant climb of the day.
I pad along the road until an obvious path towards Truskmore presents itself, and as I peel left I am forced to hop another couple of fences. A solitary figure a few hundred yards uphill notices me and watches me plodding along for a few seconds before returning to his work, cutting turf and laying the sods of peat in neat rows to dry, but I still make sure to treat the fragile fences with extra care and attention. The ground underfoot gets gradually steeper, and soon an occasional steadying hand or a bracing knee is required to make progress, until, closer to the summit plateau, we are back on the bog, with its peat hags, stinking puddles, sun-bleached skulls and freshly-drowned sheep. After waving back at the men in high-vis vests, I stop under the shadow of the radio antenna and force a bacon sandwich and two chocolate bars into my stomach as I study the map, halfway through the adjusted route and at the highest point of the day, a respectable 647m above sea level. From this vantage point, peering south into the distance, I can start to think about the details of the new route sketched out in my head: I can see a handful of paths and trails creeping up through forest and field into the Crockauns and Keelogyboys, but the ever-present question of access rights can make things far more difficult than they should be.
With the first weary sigh in an increasingly-common procession of them, I haul myself back onto my feet and descend Truskmore's tumbledown south face, then yomp over the barren but beautiful Largandoon moors, and I am treated (for the second time today) to a few kilometres of actual running down the Glencar track, built to allow access to the peat bogs and a ready supply of fuel during the coal shortages of the Second World War, but now providing a blissfully-easy route to the cafe perched on the shores of Glencar Lough and an ice-cold bottle of Club Orange. I sit and refill my Camelbak under the confused glances from a score of chubby Americans in fanny packs, squirt another energy gel into my gob, and limp away on shin-smacking tarmac up the N14, in search of a path to the route's third and final major climb.
My first attempt ends at an undeniably-visible and quite-convincing sign suggesting I go no further, and, confidence diminished through fatigue, I have to retrace my steps back down the N14, gnashing my teeth and spitting abuse at the car tires that speed past mere inches from my aching feet, until a second potential route leading up into the hills appears. I zip up the path gratefully, my eyes resolutely on the ground to avoid seeing any “No Access” signs, speeding up as much as my legs and lungs will allow until I am far enough up the hill to be away from any human interference. Breathless and dripping with sweat after a mercifully quick-and-brutal ascent, I am soon at the top of Hangman's Hill, a deliciously evocatively-named summit with a commanding view over both the previous few hours' toil and the shrinking list of summits yet to come. The world is absolutely silent except for an insistent breeze, and it takes every available ounce of willpower to not just plonk myself down and absorb it all through passive meditation, but I manage to convince myself that a dozen equally-engrossing views are waiting at the top of the next few hills. At a distance, I can clearly see the black mouth of a deep cave near the top of Keelogyboy's northern summit, and powerless as I am against the childish urge to explore such things, I have to make a detour of a few hundred metres to rummage around in its depths. Lacking helmet and headtorch, however, I am quickly turned back, only to be treated at the entrance of the cave to the exciting spectacle of two furious crows mobbing a pair of ravens, their shrill cries echoing off the dripping rock walls as they swoop and dive around the much larger birds. But it's cold in the shade, and as I start to shiver I realise, annoyingly, that I am lingering because I am slightly exhausted, and that I am deliberately delaying the last few kilometres of the route. So I shovel what little fuel I have left into my face and kick myself out the front door of the cave, up to the summit, and past the uninspired-but-aesthetic Sramore Lough.
The last of the caffeine and sugars that I brought with me kick in, and with no fluids left my pack is as light as a feather, so I am soon hopping with renewed vigour across a hallucinatory landscape where the early-evening sun has started to cast long, twisted shadows across the time-carved limestone, the ground spread with a tapestry of a thousand hues of heather and heath. A steep, speedy descent through crumbling blocks of stone down to Sramore drops me right in front of two men with sledgehammers, their quad bikes piled high with fence posts and coils of barbed wire.
“Hello!” I call tentatively, desperately trying to keep the lid on a bubbling pot of anguish and remorse over every strand of barbed wire I've clambered over today, with another two freshly-constructed barriers just fifty metres away from us, blocking the route to the top of my next summit. “Umm, do you think you would mind if I just hopped your fence there? I'll be ever so careful…”
“Sure, go mad,” one of them replies cheerily. “Where are you headed?”
“Oh, up this side, down the other, on to Leean Mountain, then down towards Lough Gill and Parke's Castle…”
“Well, rather you than me, anyways!” the second fellow chuckles. We wish each other a good evening, and I set off across the heather, over their new fences, and up a slope that turns out to be much steeper than it looked from across the valley, and happens to be suddenly and shockingly studded with the odd particularly-malevolent patch of bramble and bracken, the former gripping my calves with keen claws and the latter encouraging a spontaneous descent. But I can't slow down whilst the eyes of these two kind-hearted strangers are upon my back, and it is red-faced and wheezing that I explode onto the summit of Keelogyboy East, out of sight of an audience who I inexplicably thought I should try and impress, and onto the floor.
Frightfully embarrassed for myself, after pulling myself together I stumble down yet another steep and grassy slope, contour through and over the clustered hillocks of Fawnlion, tip-toe through one last stretch of sucking bog, and trudge, slowly but determined, to the top of today's final summit, Leean Mountain, having managed to squeeze around 1800m of ascent from the rugged, undulating hills of Sligo and Leitrim. I make the call to my rescue party, who promises to have water and a change of clothes waiting for me in the car. I take one last look at the string of summits behind me, then set off down the remaining few kilometres to the road, that hallowed ribbon of tarmac that leads to cold beer, hot shower, and grilled meat.

This was the final big run I was able to go on whilst training for the Mont Blanc 80km later this month. Hopefully it'll be enough. I'm running the Mont Blanc 80km to raise money for the North West Hospice in Sligo, and there is still time to donate if you have anything to spare, but if not, maybe you would consider sharing the link below among family and friends. Thanks for your help, it really is appreciated.

38km distance, 1800m ascent, potential issues with access. Respect your surroundings, don't break any fences, don't drop any litter, if the landowner is around then ask for permission, and if they aren't, then run like hell and you'll probably get away with it.

Food(ie) for Thought: Using NLP to find familiar meals at new restaurants Hari Sivakumar Blocked Unblock Follow Sep 28, 2017 Hari Sivakumar has a PhD in Electrical and Computer Engineering from UC Santa Barbara, and was an Insight Data Science Fellow in the Fall of 2016. Here he describes the project he worked on as a Fellow, in which he used natural language processing on web-scraped menu data to find similar menu items across different restaurants. Hari now works as a data scientist at Facebook.
Eating a mushroom crepe with mushroom sauce after 6 years
I came up for an idea for an app that would allow users to input their favorite restaurant, and their favorite menu item from that restaurant. The app would then return similar menu items at other restaurants, along with more details like restaurant location, menu item price and Yelp rating. Developing my Insight project idea The first week of the Insight Data Science program in Silicon Valley involves choosing a project that we will eventually demo to companies. The Program Directors heavily emphasize choosing a project that has the following attributes: Strong business impact Relatable to a large audience Can be validated After lots of brainstorming and having ideas torn down, I settled on an idea to build a predictor for restaurant menu item prices. For example, given a set of attributes like cuisine type, location and size, I wanted to predict how much a certain menu item should cost, and if it can be obtained for a lower cost within a short distance. I ran my idea by an Insight alumnus who had returned to mentor students, and what he said had a large impact on me and the direction in which I took my project: “If I'm a regular shopper at Whole Foods, I'm not going to go to Trader Joe's just because something is cheaper there; I like Whole Foods!” He continued, “However, what happens if the Whole Foods near me closes down? Or if I move to a neighborhood which doesn't have a Whole Foods, then where do I go for my Kale, Quinoa and Almond Milk Smoothie? To me, that's the business use case; the cost doesn't matter when there is a product that I like, but availability is far more important when I no longer have access to it.” A light bulb went off in my head, and I was transported to a time many years ago… The backstory: I just really wanted that mushroom crepe It was 6 years ago but I remember like it was just yesterday. It was my first time visiting San Francisco, and a good friend of mine took me to a French restaurant called Ti Couz for breakfast. There, I had this: Heavenly mushroom crepe from Ti Couz! It was the most heavenly crepe I'd ever had, a delicious Champignon mushroom filling with a very unique mushroom sauce. It was so amazing that I ordered a second one and snapped a picture of it (above) with my old Samsung Galaxy S1, and I never take pictures of my food! Fast forward to the summer of 2011, and I came back to San Francisco for a vacation. I was so eager to go to Ti Couz again, but I was disappointed to see that Ti Couz was closed. A little bit of Googling showed me that Ti Couz had closed for good. Ti Couz gone (Yelp) I had been gearing up for months to sink my teeth into that mouth-watering crepe, and I was very disappointed. As I was looking dejectedly at Ti Couz's Yelp page, staring in disbelief at the large blue banner indicating that the restaurant was permanently closed, I noticed that Yelp provided recommendations for similar spots.
Yelp's recommendations for similar spots A quick perusal of their menus clearly shows that none of these restaurants serve a mushroom crepe with mushroom sauce (I even went to Crepevine and asked in person!). I also tried searching on Yelp, Google, Foursquare and Zagat for “crepe mushroom sauce” in the city of San Francisco, but I couldn't find any satisfactory results. (**)
Web app I created, thanks in no small part to some very talented Insight fellows :)
Eating a mushroom crepe with mushroom sauce after 6 years
Baseball on the horizon! It's been a long offseason and Rockies fans are ready to get back into the swing of things. Here are ten of many, many reasons you should be pumped for the 2015 season.
1. The Division
After a wildly thrilling World Series win for the Giants, a brazen-faced offseason for the Padres, and the Dodgers flashing their checkbooks like only the Dodgers can, the NL West is poised to be one of the most, if not the most, interesting divisions in baseball. What this means for the Rockies is a lot of tough competition, but also the inevitable home runs off guys like Kershaw, Bumgarner, Shields, etc. They're just that much more satisfying. New faces in the neighborhood and tons of good baseball—it's all very exciting.
2. The Lineup
Speed, smarts, and so much power. I'll just leave this here...
3. Young Guns
The Rockies love the veteran presence guys like Jorge De La Rosa and Kyle Kendrick bring to this year's starting rotation, but look out for the up and comers! Tyler Matzek and Jordan Lyles, at just 24 years old (the two share an October birthday), have the momentum to do big things in 2015. Matzek is coming off of an impressive rookie campaign as one of the most reliable pitchers in the organization. Tyler averaged over six innings per start—going the distance on September 5 for his first career complete game shutout—and gave up zero unearned runs from the time of his call up in mid-June. Jordan Lyles made use of his two month stint on the disabled list by putting a new spin on his changeup, and so far the results have been pleasing. Lyles is rolling this spring with an ERA currently sitting at 0.86 in his six starts. Full seasons from Matzek and Lyles will be huge on their own, but with highly anticipated prospects Jon Gray and Eddie Butler looking to make an impact this year, and late season boosts from a healthy Tyler Chatwood and possibly Tyler Anderson, this could very well be the best young pitching staff the team has ever seen.
4.Best Seat in the House
Can't make it down to 20th and Blake? Don't fret! ROOT SPORTS and their fancy camera work are here to make at-home viewing so much cooler in 2015. From ROOT SPORTS:
Enhancing broadcasts from Coors Field this season will be the addition of a 4K zoom function to each ‘SuperMo' super slow motion camera. In 2014, ROOT SPORTS was one of the first sports networks to employ the Grass Valley 6x Super Slow Motion system, and the new zoom feature will provide an ultra-clear look of key plays. Further, this winter the network relocated the centerfield camera position to a dead-center location, allowing for an improved view of pitch movement and the strike zone
5. Shifts!
Last year the Rockies were among the teams that employed the fewest number of shifts during a season where much of baseball seemed to take the idea and run with it. This spring, we've already seen the Rockies put on more shifts than they did in all of 2014. It will be interesting to see how the strategy translates over the course of the season. Obviously, this is not an infield that allows much to get through; but if the repositioning can cut down online drives and bloop singles into the monstrous Coors Field middle ground, the Rockies can limit the small-ball game of opposing teams.
6. Spilly with the Call
Big news from ROOT SPORTS coming into this season: Former Rockie and good friend of the Row, Ryan Spilborghs, will be seeing time in the broadcast booth alongside Drew Goodman. Spilly's unique perspective and first-hand understanding of the organization can only mean great things for game coverage. Forever a fan favorite, that guy.
7. On the Farm
The depth in the Rockies organization is at an all-time high, with tons of major league potential from Grand Junction to Albuquerque and every stop in between—especially in between! If you haven't yet given Drew Creasman's piece on last year's Asheville Tourists team a read, you can here. Look for another big year from the Rockies' minor leaguers, and let your personal fandom blossom even before they make it to the bigs. Hint: Things ought to be pretty nuts in Modesto.
8. LaTroy's Last Stand
After 20 years in the big leagues, Rockies closer LaTroy Hawkins has announced that he'll be hanging up his spikes come season's close. At 42, Hawkins is the oldest active player in MLB, racking up over 1,420 innings of work to date. His final campaign may not generate the national media attention that Derek Jeter's final season did, but having played for ten different teams—six of which the Rockies will see at some point this summer—there will undoubtedly be plenty heart warming nods of appreciation to the veteran. Rockies fan share so many fond memories with Hawk, from the magic of the 2007 championship run to his 1,000th major league appearance seven years later. Enjoy this last season alongside one of the good ones. A player like LaTroy doesn't come around often.
9. Who's on First
After a frustrating season behind the plate for Wilin Rosario, the Rockies signed free agent catcher Nick Hundley to a two-year deal back in January. The Rockies then announced that, in order to keep his bat in the lineup, Rosario would be adding first base to his repertoire. This idea of platooning Rosario and Justin Morneau isn't about alleviating a struggling Morneau; he's good. Like, reigning NL batting champ good. Think of it instead as a blueprint for salivation-worthy power from the middle of the lineup. The figures:
Justin Morneau has a career .896 OPS against right-handed pitchers, putting up 178 home runs and 639 RBIs off of righties in 12 seasons. His .341 average vs RHP last season demonstrated that he's aging very well.
well. Wilin Rosario, on the other hand, annihilates left-handed pitching. His career 1.009 OPS and .328/.361/.647 slash line speak for themselves. Loudly.
The platoon won't be 1-to-1. Justin Morneau will still see the majority of the playing time, but whichever way you flip it, the result is moonshots.
10. (in)Field of Dreams
Better than your fantasy team.
Shh. Soon.
The video the band shot for “On Hold” in Marfa, where it did some of the first recording sessions for the new album at a cozy local studio, captured it in a new mode: clowning under the Texas sun, with band members riding shopping carts and skateboards, and Mr. Smith D.J.ing a house party for high schoolers.
But the core of the xx — an endearing insecurity — hasn't disappeared. Over a breakfast of huevos rancheros the morning after the show, the band admitted to renewed stage fright. “Last night — that felt scarier than Radio City,” Mr. Sim said.
Together, the band members came across as thoughtful, courteous and unified. Ms. Madley Croft was relatively voluble, and Mr. Smith almost entirely self-effacing; Mr. Sim genially, patiently measured his words. They never interrupted one another.
Ms. Madley Croft compared the saloon performance to the awkward club shows at the 2009 CMJ Music Marathon in New York that brought the xx its first buzz in the United States. Back then, they stood stiffly by their instruments in near darkness, barely acknowledging the audience.
When the band started, the xx imposed its own strictures. To stay personal, Ms. Madley Croft and Mr. Sim would each sing only lyrics they had written themselves. They also avoided, as they still do, specifics like place names or gendered pronouns — using you and me, not he and she — “so you can fit it into your own life and imagine yourself within it,” Ms. Madley Croft said. And even on a recording, an xx song could only have the parts that could be played onstage. “We never set out to be a minimal band,” she said. “We just couldn't play our instruments very well.”
But with “I See You,” the xx upended its old methods. They recorded outside the familiarity of London (though they eventually returned there) in Marfa, Los Angeles and Reykjavik, Iceland — places with sunshine and wide-open landscapes. And they fanned out for projects on their own. Mr. Sim appeared in fashion videos for Dior Homme. Mr. Smith stepped up his sideline as a D.J., remixer and producer, touring widely and releasing an album of his own in 2015, “In Colour,” that included the other xx members among many guest vocalists. He bought his first real synthesizer — a 1970s-vintage Oberheim that supplies many of the swooping sounds in “On Hold” — after using for so long cheap keyboards, samplers and software sounds. Making music outside the xx also put Mr. Smith in serious recording studios for the first time in a career of laptop recordings.
A new woman's-only workspace and social club in New York City, created to offer like-minded members a place to network and connect, seeks to offer an alternative to standard coworking spaces and their sometimes “bro-centric” culture, and tap into the “magic that's created when women gather together.”
The Wing —the brainchild of 29-year-old Audrey Gelman, a PR specialist who was the inspiration for the Marnie character on Girls, and her friend and partner Lauren Kassen, previously a director at ClassPass—came out of a desire to create a woman's-only space that offers the flexibility of coworking spaces and the community of social clubs without being too stuffy. The name itself is a play off the wing of a home, a reference to a space of one's own.
Designed by Leong Leong, with interiors by Chiara de Rege and Hilary Koyfman of CDR&Co, The Wing offers a light, airy, Scandinavian-accented gathering space, with a library and workspace (stacked with a collection of books by female authors), a kitchen, and a beauty room complete with custom toile wallpaper by Flat Vernacular showing scenes of working women throughout the city.
This wallpaper is my happy place. A photo posted by Lauren Kassan (@lololevine) on Jul 12, 2016 at 2:01pm PDT
The designers of the 3,500-square-foot space deliberately focused on light-filled, open layouts, meant to invoke a more domestic and residential atmosphere, all part of the goal of providing a home away from home.
“Other clubs can be intimidating,” Gelman says. “We want people to perceive a very ‘come-as-you-are' attitude.”
The concept for The Wing came to Gelman as a means of both juggling an overtaxed, contemporary schedule, and paying tribute to the tradition of early 20th century women's clubs. During days spent running between meetings in Manhattan, she found herself jumping between coffee shops, hotel lobbies, and coworking spaces such as Breather, constantly on the move, constantly hauling a laptop, and constantly feeling cramped, crowded, or short on time.
With lockers, a kitchen, and a calendar of events focused on professional development and socializing, The Wing aims to be a place to reconnect and relax, and serve as an in-between place during hectic days.
“I needed a flexible space designed with women in mind,” she says. “As I started to really hone in on what this thing is that I needed, I came upon this slice of women's history I didn't know about.”
These early women's clubs, located in women's boarding houses other spaces throughout the city, were used in the same way men would use gentleman's clubs, offering spaces for networking, leisure activities, and political organizing (especially around suffrage) for the first waves of women attending universities and beginning careers. The Wing actually found a space at 5 East 20th Street near Gramercy Park, in an area that was once known as Ladies' Mile, where many of New York's more than 600 women-only clubs of the time were located.
The Wing currently has 250 members, who pay $1,950 annually ($1,500 for founding members), or $185 each month, but will accept new applications on the 25th of every month. While the focus is squarely on building community around the first location, the endeavor has attracted a slate of investors, including AOL, Harvey Spevak, CEO of Equinox, Elizabeth Cutler, and Julie Rice, founder of Soul Cycle, suggesting this concept has room to expand.
I've been using React.js for a little while now, both in my 9 to 5 job and for my own projects, and during that time I have started evolving my own set of React.js best practices.
The following guidelines mostly focus on component structure and JSX. However, they are not hard and fast rules, but more of an opinionated set of guidelines I choose to adhere to that make my code more readable, more robust and easily maintainable.
Note: This article does not provide explanations of the React paradigms or idioms mentioned here or used in the examples, that is best left to the excellent documentation provided by the React team.
Component organisation
As with any code, it's important to have consistency. This of course also applies when structuring your React components. I use the following pattern:
React.createClass({ propTypes: {}, mixins : [], getInitialState: function() {}, getDefaultProps: function() {}, componentWillMount : function() {}, componentWillReceiveProps: function() {}, componentWillUnmount : function() {}, _parseData : function() {}, _onSelect : function() {}, render : function() {} })
I like to declare propTypes at the top of my component as they are a useful guide to a components expected usage (see section below for more on this), followed by the mixins because it is handy to initially know exactly what external behaviours the component is using/dependent on.
I choose to split the life-cycle methods into those that occur before an instance of the component is created (e.g. getInitialState , getDefaultProps ) and those which occur during the mounting/updating/mounted cycle (e.g. componentWillMount , shouldComponentUpdate ). Furthermore, I find that declaring the lifecycle methods in order of execution also makes the component easier to reason about.
I always have my custom methods follow the lifecycle methods and be prefixed with an underscore to make them easier to identify. I'll usually also group these by utility (parsers, event handlers, etc).
I like the render method to always be last. The render method is a mandatory lifecycle method and it's almost always the function I need to find first when I open a file. Consequently, it's pragmatic to have it in a consistent location across all of my components.
In general, my mixins will follow the same conventions as regular components.
Always set propTypes for validation and self-documentation
I always use propTypes to provide validation for each prop the component will receive. Furthermore, this also provides a self-documenting reference for how the component should be used, and what props it needs to be passed.
propTypes: { arrayProp: React.PropTypes.array, boolProp: React.PropTypes.bool, funcProp: React.PropTypes.func, numProp: React.PropTypes.number, objProp: React.PropTypes.object, stringProp: React.PropTypes.string, }
JSX
Let's face it, JSX can look pretty ugly at times and is one of the more common reasons developers are put off by React. However, by following a few general guidelines for handling JSX in components, it's far more readable and not such an eyesore.
Multi-line JSX
No matter how few elements are being returned, I choose to write any JSX which contains nested elements across multiple lines with indentation to enhance readability, i.e:
return ( <div> <ComponentOne /> <ComponentTwo /> </div> );
Rather than…
return (<div><ComponentOne /><ComponentTwo /></div>);
Furthermore, while the parenthesis are not technically required with a single line JSX statement, I still use them for the sake of consistency (and because unrestrained elements floating about in my JS makes my left eye twitch uncontrollably).
Conditional JSX
When I have conditional elements that needs to be returned depending on state, props, or another condition, I declare an empty variable at the top of the render function and only populate it with JSX if the condition is met. When the variable is returned in the render method return statement, it'll either render the conditional elements, or nothing at all.
var optionalElement; if (this.props.condition) { optionalElement = (<div> … </div>); } return ( <div> … {optionalElement} … </div> );
In-line list iteration
Where possible, I like to iterate over lists of data in-line in the returned JSX unless its internal logic is sufficiently complex enough to warrant moving outside of the return statement and populating an array for rendering.
return ( <div> {this.props.list.map(function(data, i) { return (<Component data={data} key={i} />) })} </div> );
Indentation and new line for component attributes
When there are enough attributes on a component that displaying them inline becomes untidy (usually 3 or more), I always display them on multiple lines and indent each one. i.e.
<Component attribute={...} anotherAttribute={...} attributeThree={...} … />
Rather than…
<Component attribute={...} anotherAttribute={...} attributeThree={...} />
Conclusion
These guidelines are by no means authoritative or exhaustive, but I feel they are a good starting point for organising and standardising React components and some of the more common use cases I encounter.
Hopefully these guidelines provide a useful starting point for organising your React components. Be sure to leave a comment if you have a question!

Germany's Interior Minister Thomas de Maiziere has lifted the lid on the perverse logic of some migrants who commit crimes so they won't be deported — because they know the court system will keep them in Europe.
The interior minister — who is a fellow member of Chancellor Angela Merkel's Christian Democrat Party which is the leading force in the governing German coalition — made the remarks yesterday, reports HuffingtonPost.de.
The comments came as he called to speed up the deportations of migrants who had lodged spurious asylum claims. Mr. de Maiziere said: “[migrants] shortly before deportation… commit an offence with the intention of being brought before a German judge [which would] delay [them] being deported”.
The interior minister also bemoaned the slow process of repatriating migrants away from Germany, and the lack of resources devoted to the process by his government. Criticising “sluggish” systems, Mr. de Maiziere said the individual German states who were responsible for deportations have “little political will to apply the residence law”.
Germany's Deutsche Welle reports the latest migration figures used by Mr. de Maiziere to illustrate his point, which show there are now 219,000 migrants who are to be deported from Germany. Yet of them some 168,000 can't be deported because of “obstacles” — in most cases meaning they are from countries that the German government considers unsafe.
The remaining 51,000 for whom there were no official reasons to prevent their being sent home were still living in Germany in great numbers, said Mr. de Maiziere, because of bureaucratic inertia.
Showing his skill for the political euphemism, de Maiziere suggested one of the reasons for there having been so few successful deportations was “insufficient cooperation from the deportees”— meaning t going off the radar and evading authorities once being informed of their expected departure.
Despite this, the interior minister said he hopes for migrants leaving of their own free will to increase this year, to as high as 61,000. In total, he anticipates that Germany could deport 100,000 of the estimated two million “foreigners” who arrived in the country in 2015.
Listen to the discussion of this article on Breitbart News Daily on SiriusXM:
The Northwest Territories is expected to get a final devolution agreement Monday, which will give the territory control over its Crown lands and resources.
Prime Minister Stephen Harper will visit Yellowknife Monday, and he is expected to make the historic announcement. He will be joined by N.W.T. Premier Bob McLeod, Bernard Valcourt, the Minister of Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development, and Leona Aglukkaq, who is the minister responsible for the Canadian Northern Economic Development Agency.
Aboriginal leaders from the five groups who have signed on to the agreement-in-principle are also scheduled to appear at the ceremony.
There will be a public event at the Legislative Assembly, starting around noon local time.
The idea of devolution isn't new. In fact, Yukon signed a similar agreement in 1993.
Here are five things to know about devolution:
1. What is N.W.T. devolution?
Right now, Ottawa owns almost all the public land and waters in the territory. The federal government makes the final decisions on the development of resources such as oil and gas, and mines, and keeps almost all of the money companies pay to develop the resources (resource revenue).
Tlicho Grand Chief Eddie Erasmus and N.W.T. Premier Bob McLeod officially sign the Tlicho government on to the N.W.T.'s devolution agreement-in-principle on Friday in Behchoko. The Tlicho are one of five aboriginal groups to sign on to the agreement. (CBC)
The devolution agreement being negotiated will transfer control of public land and resources to the N.W.T. The territory will make the decisions about resource development and will keep 50 per cent of resource revenue, up to an annual limit of about $60 million.
In the agreement-in-principle, the federal government agrees to provide one-time transition costs and annual money to fund the territory's land and resource management programs, and to transfer all existing federal northern development department assets such as buildings and building leases.
2. Where will this resource revenue money go?
The N.W.T. has committed up to a quarter of its share of resource revenue to aboriginal governments that sign on to the final devolution agreement. The N.W.T.'s fiscal responsibility policy pledges to use the rest for paying down debt and investing in infrastructure rather than for day-to-day operating expenses.
3. Which aboriginal governments have signed on to devolution?
The Northwest Territory Métis Nation, the Inuvialuit Regional Corporation, the Sahtu Secretariat, the Gwich'in Tribal Council and the Tlicho government. The Akaitcho Territory government and the Dehcho First Nations have not.
4. Does this transfer of ownership include offshore oil and gas resources?
No. The federal government will keep ownership of offshore resources. But the agreement-in-principle commits Canada to begin negotiating offshore resource revenue sharing with N.W.T. within 60 days of the signing of a final devolution agreement.
5. What will be different after devolution?
Besides having decision-making power over lands and resources and a new source of revenue, the territory will inherit about 175 federal Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development employees based in N.W.T. whose jobs are affected by devolution. The GNWT will likely also need to hire more people to handle tasks that were done for these Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development workers by other federal departments.
Sports Chosun via Naver1. [+1,869, -192] So what has she been up to that she's media playing so much lately?2. [+1,405, -202] It's amazing how she still claims that she never had an opportunity to clarify herself when she was the one who acted like the victim for being kicked out of the group without telling what actually happened3. [+957, -182] If you really do wish the best for SNSD, you'd stop mentioning them...4. [+539, -93] If her income is 0 won, then that tvN show lied on their TV show. Their show said that her business was ranked at the top for making tons of money but her income is 0 won? It's either she's lying or the TV show is lying.5. [+253, -30] After leaving the group, she only posted in Chinese on Weibo and didn't clarify anything to her Korean fans before leaving on a plane to China and taking pictures with famous people acting like she was living a happy life. But of course she's making 0 in income so she's back to promoting in Korea, pretending like she cares for her Korean fans again and doing all sorts of interviews to promote her album. I see right through her.6. [+158, -15] She left claiming to go to fashion school to study design but all she did was hold fan meetings before resorting to Korean activities to sell her merchandise ㅋㅋㅋ the reality of her media play has been exposed ㅋㅋㅋ Her solo album was only received attention because it's her first album since leaving SNSD and as expected, her digital rank dropped down ㅋㅋㅋ I knew that would happen7. [+214, -34] It's funny how she's giving interviews like this when she's the one who attacked the members for kicking her out at first ㅋㅋㅋ Like she claims, the members were never against her business, and whatever happened was decided by the company. The members made the best decision they could under the circumstances but for her to write the post that she did was very selfish and one sided.8. [+151, -20] I never got the feeling that she released this album because she wanted to sing but moreso to promote her brand more
Thursday night will be the final head-to-head meeting between LeBron James and Kobe Bryant. James has the edge in both team wins and individual statistics in previous matchups.
Here is a by-the-numbers look at their previous meetings heading into Thursday's game.
Kobe vs. LeBron by the numbers
0 - With the Los Angeles Lakers already eliminated from playoff contention, Bryant will retire having played zero playoff games against James.
9 - Each of the past nine NBA Finals has had one team led by either James or Bryant but never both. In that time, James' Cleveland Cavaliers or Miami Heat made the Finals in 2015, 2014, 2013, 2012, 2011 and 2007. Bryant's Lakers were in the Finals in 2010, 2009 and 2008.
James recently said, "I know the world wanted to see it. I wanted it -- we wanted it. He held up his end and I didn't hold up my end, and I hate that. I hate that that didn't happen."
Each of the last nine NBA Finals has featured either LeBron James or Kobe Bryant, but never both. ESPN Stats & Information
13 and 3 - James ranks 13th and Bryant ranks third on the NBA's all-time scoring list. Bryant enters Thursday's game trailing Karl Malone by 3,593 points for second place on that list. James is 237 points behind Dominique Wilkins in 12th place.

UPDATED: The "Before Midnight" actor sounds off in a Gotham magazine interview on the "forgettable, stupid movies" that took home Academy Awards.
Ethan Hawke sounds off on the Oscars in the latest issue of Gotham magazine, taking aim at "forgettable, stupid movies" and "mediocre performers."
Echoing The Master best-actor nominee Joaquin Phoenix's assertion that award season is "total utter bullsh--," Hawke -- who was nominated himself for his supporting role in 2001's Training Day and for co-writing the screenplay to 2004's Before Sunset -- rails against the Academy Awards and the heated competition surrounding the ceremony.
REVIEW: 'Before Midnight'
"People want to turn everything in this country into a competition," he tells Gotham (via The New York Post), so "it's clear who the winner is and who the loser is. ... It's why they like to announce the grosses of movies, because it's a way of saying, ‘This one is No. 1.'"
He continues: "It's so asinine ... if you look at how many forgettable, stupid movies have won Oscars and how many mediocre performers have Oscars above their fireplace. Making a priority of chasing these fake carrots and money and dubious accolades, I think it's really destructive."
Hawke, whose recent film credits include the 2012 horror movie Sinister, is currently acting off-Broadway in the play Clive, about a hedonistic songwriter in '90s-era New York. He'll next be seen on the big screen in the thriller The Purge as well as Richard Linklater's buzzy Before Midnight, the latest drama in the evolving romantic saga of Jesse (Hawke) and Celine (Julie Delpy). That film opens in limited release May 24.
UPDATE: Hawke released the following statement to THR:
“I think the Oscars do a very good job in representing much of the great work in a given year. Inevitably though, many great films and performances are not recognized and can be overlooked due to the mass marketing and PR machines that march through the awards season. I don't mean to take anything away from the genuine and deserved excitement that every nominee should feel.”

When the Trump administration announced proposals at the end of April to slash its corporation tax rate to 15%, it quickly became a cause for concern in Ireland, the future of its 12.5% rate, foreign direct investment, and the tech sector as a whole.
Frank Barry is a professor of international business and economic development at Trinity College Dublin and has been an observer of corporation tax matters in Ireland and the US for years.
Professor Barry spoke to Dublin Globe about how these changes in the US are unlikely to come to pass for many reasons, how Ireland should continue to respond to criticisms of its corporate tax rates as well as deal with the ongoing challenges of Brexit.
Youve previously spoken about Trumps plans on corporation tax. Now that we have some more specifics, how will Ireland be affected?
The timing was interesting. Trumps treasury secretary announced further details of what theyre talking about with respect to changes in corporation tax policy. Thats of interest to Ireland because clearly most of the foreign firms that we get here are American and to the extent that a lot of Irelands foreign direct investment is associated with corporation tax matters, any changes in US corporation tax policy potentially have important implications for us.
What I was talking about a couple of months ago was much more nebulous because it wasnt clear what the Trump administration was planning. Then they seemed to give some clearer indication but its still very hard to pin down because US tax policy is not the sole responsibility of the president. It has to get through Congress and weve already seen that he hasnt been very successful in dealing with Congress on other matters. Its very unlikely, or most analysts deem it unlikely, that they will actually be able to get these proposals through Congress but still you have to start somewhere.
Why is it unlikely to happen?
Companies would love it but it will blow the budget deficit apart. It would be very costly and the Republican party, like most political parties, is a coalition of interests. Some of them really want to do the bidding of what the big multinationals want. Others, and this has been a tradition in the Republican party, are fiscally conservative and they dont like budget deficits and so this idea of more than halving the rate of corporation tax down to 15% would be so costly that fiscal conservatives, who essentially dominate in the Republican party, are not going to like that.
When he was on the campaign trail, Trump was talking about combining a rate cut like that with whats called a border adjustment tax that would essentially tax imports into the US to pay for the budget deficit consequences of slashing the corporation tax rate.
This border adjustment tax didnt make an appearance in the announcement [last month]. Its very likely that it didnt because it would be in breach of the World Trade Organisation rules and would provoke a trade war. Thats not going to be good for anybody so I think the US administration has finally seen sense and realised that a trade war is not in its own interests or anybody elses interest so its not going to proceed with that.
Therefore it now has no way of paying for the budgetary consequences of this slashing of the corporation tax.
With all this talk around corporation tax rates and US companies, how should Ireland respond?
Ireland essentially has no power in this matter. Theres not really anything much we can do. We rely on the big countries to make the running. The important point to make is that I dont think a cut in the American corporation tax rate would be damaging to us anyway. The way most Irish analysts and journalists seem to have interpreted it is as though were competing with the US on corporation tax. I think were not.
Theres been a huge change to campaign rhetoric. On the campaign trail, Donald Trump announced that he wants to abolish deferral, which is this really important component of the US tax system. US companies operating abroad can continue to owe taxes to the US exchequer but they can defer payment of those taxes until the profits are repatriated to the US so that incentivises American companies to hold their offshore profits to avoid triggering this US tax liability.
This whole notion of deferral was dropped and they announced instead to move to a territorial tax system that essentially means US multinationals profits that they earn outside the US are not liable for any US tax. Thats hugely significant. In fact for Ireland thats probably more significant than the announcement about the drop in corporation tax. This gets complicated but this in many ways would be a bigger change to the US tax system.
If the two [proposals] were to go together, it would massively increase the incentive for US multinationals to invest both in America and across the globe. Thats clearly not detrimental to us. Its taking the two bits together that one really needs to focus on.
One can take them one at a time and say ok, if the US cuts its corporation tax rate, what are the implications for Ireland? Well, Ireland is not really competing against the US on corporation tax except in one respect. Its called redomiciling where American headquarters could essentially reverse gear into an Irish company and become an Irish company. That was done for tax reasons. Thats actually detrimental to Ireland and Barack Obama prevented that happening by executive order.
How was that detrimental?
Bizarrely because it raises our GDP without raising whats a better measure of Irish national income which is gross national product. Our payments to the EU depend on our GDP. Redomiciling of these companies raises our GDP and therefore raises our required contribution to Brussels without really affecting our national income. It doesnt really create new jobs. It might create some small number of jobs when they move their headquarters but what were interested in is jobs with substance.
Beyond that its wrong to think that were competing with the US on corporation tax rates. Really a better way to think about it is a US company decides to do business offshore outside the US, it might decide to come to Europe and then it says where is a good location in Europe in which to set up our headquarters for tax reasons? In that sense its better to think of Ireland as competing against other European countries in terms of taxes rather than competing with America.
You make it seem like any changes to corporation tax in the US just arent going to happen.
Ive been paying attention to this corporation tax stuff for a long time and essentially the American system has been paralysed for over 50 years on corporation tax, since the era of President Kennedy because they cant agree on an appropriate model for corporation tax.
Under President Kennedy, a compromise was reached that is essentially the same compromise that is in place today. Its undoubtedly outdated. It doesnt make much sense anymore and multinationals have found all sorts of loopholes to avoid the kind of requirements that the Kennedy era compromise entailed but its difficult just to get the political agreement in the US to rectify the system.
Despite that, does increase talk about tax in the US, on top of criticism from Europe, put any more pressure on Ireland to make changes?
Theres not any pressure from the Americans to change our rate of corporation tax. Americans love it because American companies are able to use it for their own purposes as of course European companies can as well.
Were not going to get any flak from the American government about our rate of corporation tax. The US Senate report into Apple back in 2013 criticised Ireland but that was US senators playing political games for their own constituencies. Those exact senators who criticised Ireland – I checked their voting records – are the same people who voted through the loopholes that they criticised companies for exploiting. Thats just political gamesmanship.
The flak we get from some European countries is likely to continue but Irelands response and the response of the G7 is that theyve handed over responsibility for global corporation tax matters to the OECD, which obviously has a wider remit than just the EU.
The OECDs initiative is called BEPS, base erosion and profit shifting. Thats their initiative for how to deal with corporation tax matters. Ireland responded to the OECD BEPS initiative by changing its legislation to get rid of the main loophole that was being used by multinational companies, which is called the Double Irish. We got rid of that with grandfathering clauses so it will be completely unusable by any company in a number of years time.
I think the Irish government probably views that as having done enough to deflect future criticism. But who knows? Weve seen the European Commission case about Apple and that will be in the courts for a few years so it will be a bit of time before we know what the outcome of that is.
The election of Trump as well as Brexit has obviously marked a big change in global politics. Where does Irelands tech sector fit into all of this and how will it be affected in the coming years?
Globalisation has been hugely good for Ireland. I think theres very few people that would disagree about that. A reverse of globalisation would clearly be bad.
Brexit is going to be extremely bad for Ireland but not so much for the tech companies. Irelands tech companies dont export so much into the UK, theyre focused more on other markets. Its mainly the food processing sector exporting into the UK. Its going to be potentially very severely damaged and because thats located outside the Dublin region, thats going to make Irish regional policy more difficult.
I think Dublin is likely to gain from Brexit because well have an inflow of financial services firms into Dublin where the rest of the country suffers. That will be economically very damaging, politically pretty difficult to handle as well because youll get Dublin benefitting and the rest of the country suffering.
I think Brexit is certainly less important for [tech firms] than it is for the food processors. Tech companies can export, they dont face customs barriers, border controls, things like that. Even a hard Brexit is unlikely to affect them the way it would affect manufactured goods.
Theres been plenty of talk about major companies potentially relocating operations, namely in the financial sector, to Ireland in light of Brexit but in your view, how likely is that?
The City of London is gigantic in terms of employment. It probably employs more people than the population of Ireland perhaps. All we need to do is attract a small sliver of financial services activities from the City of London to create a massive boost of employment in Ireland.
I think there will be no difficulty in doing that. We dont need to capture the high-profile firms, all we need is a thin sliver of that huge pie and it will increase significantly the numbers that work in the financial services sector here.
US tech companies continue to set up shop in Ireland. For example, just last month we saw the cybersecurity firm Tenable open its European HQ here. Do you expect Ireland to remain a prime location for US tech companies coming to Ireland?
I mentioned earlier the OECD BEPS initiative. Nobody could really have predicted how that would have turned out for Ireland, whether it would be beneficial or detrimental but the thrust of that initiative is that if a corporation is to be headquartered in a particular location like Ireland, it has to carry out its substantive activities there.
Companies have responded to that OECD BEPS initiative by moving more intellectual property into Ireland because they think they can support that because they do have substantive activity and so our corporation tax receipts have shot way up over the last two years as a consequence of that and this is a self-reinforcing process that companies are now on-shoring in Ireland more of their intellectual property because they have substantive activities here and that will require them to develop more substantive activities here to support that intellectual property.
Rather than Irelands FDI strategy unravelling, the way a lot of analysts predicted it would, I can see it going in the opposite direction. Im not at all pessimistic about the ability of the model to continue to survive and generate prosperity as I think it has undoubtedly done for us so Im much more optimistic than pessimistic on that score.
I was surprised to find out that the song had been released way back in September of 2010! That's almost a whole year ago. How did the radios miss this song for so long? I mean, it's so ridiculously catchy that I couldn't stop listening to it all day. And when I wasn't listening to it, it was playing in my head. The song is currently positioned at 8 on the Billboard Hot 100, but i wouldn't be surprised if it went even further. Maybe even to #1? The song has already far surpassed MGMT's chart peak of 91 which they had for their single "Kids." This kind of music has been " indie " for too long, it's about time it gets some mainstream attention.
I decided that since I liked the song so much I would check out the album. The album is called Torches and was released in May of 2011, so a few months ago. The original version has 10 songs, while the Best Buy exclusive has an additional 2 with a grand total of 12. The album is truly amazing, it's all I've been listening to since yesterday. I listened to it when cleaning my room, driving, and even showering. In fact, I'm listening to it while typing this right now. The only way I can summarize the album is that it's sort of a MGMT meets Mike Posner, minus explicit references to drugs or getting high (although you sometimes feel like that when listening to these songs.) It definitely has more of a pop sound than MGMT, but much less refined than Mike Posner. Overall the album is on the same level as Oracular Spectacular I would say. I know hardcore MGMT fans would beg to differ, but really this album is a gem. It's what I would've expected Congratulations to have been from MGMT. I'm not saying Congratulations was a bad album, but just not at the same level.
If you're going to buy this album, definitely get the Best Buy exclusive! It's a shame that Love and Chin Music For the Unsuspecting Hero aren't on the original version, nor on iTunes as far as I know. They're both really good songs, and Love is one of my favorites from the album.
Here a are a few tracks definitely worth listening to (besides the lead single of course which is linked above):
Waste - This is my second favorite song from the album (after Pumped up Kicks). I guarantee that it will probably be released as a single. It starts off sounding very video game like. Kind of reminds me of a Super Nintendo RPG I used to have. This song is also the most Mike Posner-ish song of the album, it has a similar style. The song is very easy listening with simple lyrics that depict reaching for freedom and the usual you can do whatever you want thing.
Houdini - This song just shows how diverse the band can be. Probably the best produced song on the album alongside with Helena Beat. This song has a really familiar melody to it, I don't know what it's called but it's that one military march theme kinda thing. You'll know what I'm taking about when you listen to this song. This song reminds of a lot of Electric feels, it's really a crazy magical song that makes you see colors when you close your eyes. No wonder it's called Houdini.
Love - I really don't get why this was only a Best Buy exclusive track! It's a great song. It's probably the whackiest song on the album, it just makes you feel happy. The melody is really heart-warming and cheery, and even the chorus says "Love Love Love, it can be a wonderful thing." I could've seen this becoming a single but I don't know about that if it isn't even on the standard edition of the album.
Some other honorable mentions on the album are like I said Helena Beat which is really well-produced, and the second single off the album. Call It Want You Want, and Miss You are my other favorites from the album. Warrant also has a really funky instrumental between verses, I love it. But really I can honestly say that I like every single song from the album. They're all catchy, well-produced and well-constructed, and unique sounding while at the same-time have that really similar style. This is electro-pop or alternative rock or whatever people call it at it's finest. By the way, The dub step and party Remixes of Pumped Up Kicks are also really good and worth a mention.
So yes, Foster The People has gone mainstream. Most of the original fans are probably going to have a superiority fit claiming that they don't like the band anymore because everyone else likes it, or that they liked it first. I never really understood fans of indie music. It's one thing to have a taste for indie music, but liking only indie music never made sense to me. You like a song that nobody else likes, but when they do all of a sudden you don't? Give me a break. Music is for everyone to enjoy, and you can't choose what you like or dislike. I personally enjoy everything, and I think people should give all kinds of music a chance with an open-mind.

And then we use Djinn Illuminatus to replicate Burst of Energy, untapping Kiki-Jiki 66, 185, 228, 434, 044, 942, 951, 864, 067, 458, 396, 061, 614, 989, 522, 267, 577, 311, 297, 802, 947, 435, 570, 493, 724, 401, 440, 549, 267, 868, 490, 798, 926, 773, 634, 494, 383, 968, 047, 143, 923, 956, 857, 140, 205, 406, 402, 740, 536, 087, 446, 083, 831, 052, 036, 848, 232, 439, 995, 904, 404, 992, 798, 007, 514, 718, 326, 043, 410, 570, 379, 830, 870, 463, 780, 085, 260, 619, 444, 417, 205, 199, 197, 123, 751, 210, 704, 970, 352, 727, 833, 755, 425, 876, 102, 776, 028, 267, 313, 405, 809, 429, 548, 880, 554, 782, 040, 765, 277, 562, 828, 362, 884, 238, 325, 465, 448, 520, 348, 307, 574, 943, 345, 990, 309, 941, 642, 666, 926, 723, 379, 729, 598, 185, 834, 735, 054, 732, 500, 415, 409, 883, 868, 361, 423, 159, 913, 770, 812, 218, 772, 711, 901, 772, 249, 553, 153, 402, 287, 759, 789, 517, 121, 744, 336, 755, 350, 465, 901, 655, 205, 184, 917, 370, 974, 202, 405, 586, 941, 211, 065, 395, 540, 765, 567, 663, 193, 297, 173, 367, 254, 230, 313, 612, 244, 182, 941, 999, 500, 402, 388, 195, 450, 053, 080, 385, 548 times (and every time Kiki-Jiki untaps, we're going to tap him again to copy more Doubling Seasons!)
Time-out for a moment, audience check: if you're grinning with glee right now, this article is probably for you, stick around and grab some popcorn. On the other hand if you're hissing, holding up garlic to the screen, and yelling 'the math, it burns!' trust me: it's only going to get worse. Get out now while you still can!
Tips and Strategies
Layers are Everything -- Run Narrower Cards
'repeat this action until you run out of [resource]'.
In the case above, the first layer was the copies of Burst of Energy on the stack:
'Untap Kiki-Jiki and copy a Doubling season for each Burst of Energy on the stack'
The second layer was the number of Fossil Finds on the stack:
'Tap Serra's Sanctum and replicate Burst of Energy a LOT of times for each Fossil Find on the stack'
Now, note that some of our earlier builds were running cards like Mycosynth Lattice--this meant that instead of having six different kinds of mana (all five colours and colourless) we had a single kind of mana, and therefore fewer total resource pools. And with fewer resource pools we got fewer layers of recursion (i.e. we couldn't say 'do [task] until you run out of green mana').
Later on, it became obvious that we could add many layers if we used the soulshift mechanic but soulshift enablers were incompatible with our 'mana matters' enablers. so we asked ourselves 'which one gives more layers?' (Turns out the answer was soulshift). Again, what really matters is getting the most layers of recursion, so out with the 'mana matters' cards and in with the soulshift cards.
Some terminology for layers
5+5 = 5 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1.
5*5 = 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 5.
5^5 = 5 * 5 * 5 * 5 * 5.
The philosophy behind Knuth's up arrow notation is 'why stop at three functions?'
5^^5 = 5^(5^(5^(5^5))).
5^^^5 = 5^^(5^^(5^^(5^^5))).
5^^^^5 = 5^^^(5^^^(5^^^(5^^^5))).
And so on. So, okay, let's remember our Doubling Season example above. Each time Kiki-Jiki copied Doubling Season, it counted X the previous number of Doubling Seasons, and adds 2^X more. Ignoring the adding part (which becomes insignificant pretty fast) it just does a 2^X increase. So if we do a copy with each of the four Kiki-Jikis, we get roughly 2^(2^(2^(2^2)))) = 2^^5. When we replicated Burst of energy 2^2059 times, what we got was something more-like 2^^( 2^2059 ). And then if we added in the replicated Fossil Find layer above all that, that means we're doing the 2^^() effect from Burst of Energy over and over, i.e. 2^^(2^^(2^^(2^^(...)))). Though hey, that looks familiar--in fact it looks rather like 2^^^(X). And then if we had some way to repeatedly bring back Fossil Find, we could up the ante again by doing 2^^^(2^^^(2^^^(...))), or roughly 2^^^^X.
Don't spend too much time worrying about what these numbers actually look like. Suffice it to say...
1. The numbers quickly get wayyyyyyy bigger than anything you could write in Scientific notation.
2. The only really important thing to watch is how many layers of recursion there are. Finding a way to spend two manas instead of three on a spell you're replicating quickly becomes barely-noticeable when the numbers are so large. Finding a way to cast your best spell a zillion times, however, is always a big deal (especially since you get a LOT more mana for the next replication after each casting).
Outline of current best deck
The entire deck changed recently. For the curious, the old deck is archived here
Layer 0, the kickstart
How it works
At this point, Eureka puts half your hand into the battlefield (Opalescence, March of the Machines, Minion Reflector, Doubling Season, Phyrexian Altar, Hanna, Ship's Navigator, Rings of Brighthearth, Vedalken Orrery, Mirror Gallery Norritt, Hana Kami, Deathknell Kami, Elder Pine of Jukai, Rootrunner, Forked-Branch Garami, Nightsoil Kami, Vine Kami, Thousand-legged Kami, Body of Jukai, Kiki-Jiki, Nature's Revolt, Karakas, Hunted Lammasu, Holistic Wisdom).
Now we're going to stack all the Minion Reflector triggers roughly in the relevant order from the combo. Here's two very useful points about Minion Reflector triggers. #1 We don't have to pay the 2-mana until we get to the triggered ability on the stack. #2 If the creature Minion Reflector was copying leaves the battlefield before the trigger resolves, it STILL makes a copy using 'Last Known Information'.
Anyhow, before we let ANY of the stack resolve, we're going to tap Kiki Jiki, and we're going to copy that with Rings of Brighthearth. In order to get 2 manas for Rings of Brighthearth, we take advantage of the 'Last Known Information' trick, and sacrifice a couple things we don't need multiple copies of (say Holistic Wisdom and Hunted Lammasu) to Phyrexian Altar. The Kiki-Jiki ability and its copy bring us from 1 Doubling Season to 11 Doubling Seasons. Now pay for the Minion Reflector trigger on Doubling Season, again using the Last Known Information trick with Phyrexian Altar on some more things we don't need in multiples like Holistic Wisdom and Vedalken Orrery (2059 Doubling Seasons now). Then use the 'Last Known Information' trick again to sac a couple more things we don't need to Phyrexian Altar (Let's say the non-hasty versions of Hanna, Ship's Navigator and Norritt). Now let the Minion Reflector triggers resolve on anything where we have no use for multiples (Vedalken Orrery, Phyrexian Altar, Hunted Lammasu, Holistic Wisdom, Mirror Gallery, Nature's Revolt) putting 2^2059 of each of them into play...which is to say 6*2^2059 mana of any colour in our mana pool. That's more than enough to launch into the combo.
Checking for infinite combos
Black Lotus is the one potentially dangerous one with Hanna, Ship's Navigator, but we have only two things in-play that can untap her--Norritt, and bouncing her with Karakas, and certainly no way to untap her with mana alone--every route to untap her in the deck uses up non-mana resources that can't be replenished using only mana (either tapping a permanent, or sacrificing a permanent, or casting a spell).
Note that Minion Reflector actually can let you get extra mana out of Black Lotus, because if March of the Machines is in play, Black Lotus dies as a state based action before triggered abilities go on the stack. However the Minion Reflector trigger still goes on the stack, and so copies the Last Known Information about the creature, and so it copies all 'copiable values'--specifically 'Other effects (including type-changing and text-changing effects), status, and counters are not copied.' Which means that if we sac each copy of March of the Machines, the Black Lotus tokens will enter the battlefield as non-creature artifacts. Doubling Season only cares that they are tokens, so it multiplies them, potentially producing a lot of manas.
However...this is only three times as much mana as we could have gotten by using any other animated artifact or enchantment with Hanna, Ship's Navigator (since any of them can be sacced to Phyrexian Altar)...and probably less mana than we would get out of bouncing and recasting Doubling Season (assuming there are multiple Minion Reflectors in play, once we get to the second trigger we will most likely be putting much, much more than triple the permanents into the battlefield).
Layers 1 and 2: copying Doubling Season
How it works
How it works
* copy of Hanna, Ship's Navigator's activated ability
* Rings of Brighthearth triggered ability
* Rings of Brighthearth triggered ability
* Rings of Brighthearth triggered ability
...
* Rings of Brighthearth triggered ability
* Rings of Brighthearth triggered ability
* Rings of Brighthearth triggered ability
* Hanna, Ship's Navigator's activated ability
So we can resolve one trigger at a time, and at the time we resolve the trigger we get to choose new targets for the copy. Hence the only copy that will fizzle to to a missing target is the original Hanna, Ship's Navigator activation. We also don't need to (and can't) pay for all the Rings of Brighthearth all at once, so feel free to sac permanents two at a time (in between putting 2^^X permanents into play each time). Once every Ring of Brighthearth trigger has been used we'll have done 2^^^X overall.
Using the Stack
This is something we're going to use at basically every layer of the combo. These Layer 3 triggers will be higher on the stack than the Layer 4 triggers, so we will exhaust all our Layer 3 triggers before moving on to the next single Layer 4 trigger. The Layer 4 triggers will be higher on the stack than the Layer 5 replications. The Layer 5 replications will be higher on the stack than the Layer 6 triggers. And so on.
Layer 4: Norritt
How it works
Layer 5: Blind with Anger
How it works
Avoiding infinites
On Mirari: note that the triggers only go on the stack when we cast the spell, and are limited to the number of copies of Mirari in play.
Layer 6: Hana Kami
How it works
Layer 7 & 8: re-play Hana Kami
How it works
Layer 9&10, 11&12, 13&14, 15&16, 17&18, 19&20, 21&22: Soulshift 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8
How it works
Avoiding infinites
Layer 23&24, repeating Body of Jukai
How it works
Layer 25&26&27, bounce Kiki-Jiki
How it works
Avoiding infinites
Layer 28&29&30, bounce and replay Karakas
How it works
One thing to be careful of is do NOT cast a Spirit or Arcane spell in between putting Karakas on top of your library with Rootrunner and letting the Wargate copy resolve. If you do cast a Spirit or Arcane spell, Elder Pine of Jukai's non-optional ability will trigger above the Wargate, and Karakas will be stuck in your hand forever; can't play it, can't get it back into your library. Obviously if we could replace Elder Pine of Jukai we would, but the only other option for Soulshift 2 is Thief of Hope (which makes the opponent die prematurely, so is much much worse).
Avoiding infinites
How it works
* copy of Reborn Hope
* Mirari triggered ability
* Mirari triggered ability
* Mirari triggered ability
...
* Mirari triggered ability
* Mirari triggered ability
* Mirari triggered ability
* Reborn Hope, original spell
So we can resolve one trigger at a time, and at the time we resolve the trigger we get to choose new targets for the copy (namely Wargate). We get one layer out of this (X castings of Wargate) so 2^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^X.
Avoiding infinites
How it works
Avoiding infinites
Layer 33&34, Reap and Twincast
How it works
Avoiding infinites
This sounds quite dangerous, since the Reap copy created by Twincast is still on the stack when Twincast goes to the graveyard. However because we chose new targets for the Reap copy before Twincast was put in the graveyard, it can't target Twincast itself, and we have no redirection in this deck, so we can't change the target of our Twincast-created copy to return the physical Twincast card. Hence Twincast can not return itself.
Layer 35, Holistic Wisdom
How it works
Avoiding infinites
Layer 36, Our Library
How it works
Okay, so this is the final layer, we can afford to be a bit more precise. We have 27 instants in the deck that can be removed (i.e. aren't Blind with Anger or Reap or Twincast). We're also not starting from 0 before the first card is removed to Holistic Wisdom. In particular, one replication of Reap gets us about 2^^...(34 arrows)...^^( kinda large number ). This is larger than 2^^...(35)...^^( 2 ) = 4, and larger than 2^^...(35)...^^( 3 ) = 2^^...(34)...^^( 4 ). However, it's probably smaller than or close to 2^^...(35)...^^( 4 ) = 2^^...(34)...^^( 2^^...(34)...^^( 4 ) ). However, that number is exactly equal to 2^^...(36)...^^( 3 ), so it seems like that's our starting point before we remove a single card with Holistic Wisdom; hence we'll add 3 to our 27 instants we're removing.
Final result: about 2^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^30.

The Shiv Sena on Monday adopted an aggressive tone over the debate on 'Hindu terrorism' and said India is "one hundred per cent a Hindu nation" and the community has no reason to spread terror in its own country.
The statement comes days after Union home minister Rajnath Singh accused Congress of weakening the fight against terror by coining the term 'Hindu terrorism'.
"Giving terror a saffron colour and playing politics over it was a cunning and selfish move. Terming Hindus as terrorists and putting a veil over green terror sponsored by Pakistan is being dishonest towards your own country," an editorial in Sena mouthpiece Saamana said on Monday.
"India basically belongs to the Hindus and 100% it is a Hindu nation. Hindus have no reason to spread terror in their own country," it said.
Attributing terrorism to Hindus worked against Congress as the community ensured the party's decimation in the Lok Sabha elections, it said.
The Sena further asked whether terror activities in Jammu and Kashmir could be attributed to Hindu organisations. It also sought to know if the acts of Afzal Guru and Ajmal Kasab will be called as "Hindu terror".
"Were Ajmal Kasab and Afzal Guru sponsored by Hindu organisations? Did Pakistan make a certain 'Kashinath' into Kasab and send him to India to spread terror?" the Sena asked.
The "rumours" spread by Congress have given strength to Pakistan's conspiracies and "have filled the chests of ISI and LeT with pride", the party alleged.
The Union home minister, after making a statement in the Lok Sabha on Gurdaspur attack last week, had said the previous UPA government had coined the term 'Hindu terrorism' to change the course of probe into the incidents of terrorism.
"In this House in 2013, the then home minister (P Chidambaram) had coined the new terminology 'Hindu terrorism' in order to change the course of probe. Because of this, we have not been able to fight terrorism as strongly as we should be.
"As a consequence of coining the new term of 'Hindu terrorism', Hafiz Sayeed (LeT founder) of Pakistan had congratulated the then Home Minister. Our government will never allow such a shameful situation again," Singh had said.

Many Brits will have come across the Cannabis Is Safer Than Alcohol (CISTA) party for the first time when they looked at their ballot paper on Thursday. Others will still probably never have heard of this niche party.
But though they're small and - yes - focused on one single issue, they notched up a couple of triumphs in the 2015 General Election.
The Cannabis party beat the BNP
This party beat the British National Party in terms of votes, this year.
A few years back there were serious concerns that the BNP could win seats and thus change British politics forever.
Yet now the party is all but destroyed.
BNP votes vs Cannabis party votes Votes
The Cannabis party is also more popular than Tories - in Northern Ireland
The Cannabis party had candidates in 33 constituencies - 19 in England, 4 in Northern Ireland, 8 in Scotland, and 1 in Wales.
The Cannabis party made their strongest showing in West Tyrone, with 528. There, they even beat the Conservatives, who got 169.
It's the same story in East Londonderry, where they beat the Tories with 527 votes against 422.
... And in Upper Bann, it was 460 to 201 to CISTA.
Looks like the Northern Irish are among the party's biggest fans.
And in the rest of the UK... Not so much
Back in England, it was also pretty popular in Esher and Walton - more popular than their independent candidate. But their 396 votes wasn't enough to stop the Tories from taking the seat.
The one candidate in Wales (Vale of Glamorgan) only got 238 and were far behind everyone else.
And in Scotland they were no way near anyone else, on 336 votes in Rutherglen & Hamilton West, while the Liberal Democrats managed to grab 1,045 votes.
TORONTO — It's morning, which means Michael Hutchinson must be thankful.
Hutchinson is thankful he gets to stop pucks snapped at him by the world's elite, savouring every one of the 1,589 minutes he's spent in the blue paint this season.
The Barrie, Ont., native is thankful that 50 of his closest friends and family members will file into Air Canada Centre tonight to see him play in the closest thing to a homecoming.
And he's especially grateful to the Boston Bruins — the team that took a chance on him as a third-round draft choice seven years ago — for giving up on him.
“You take every moment for granted and really cherish it. Every day I wake up excited to come to practice. I get to skate with the best players in the world every single day,” Hutchinson says. “It's unbelievable — one of those things where every day you wake up and can't believe where you are.”
Where Hutchinson was two years ago was two injuries away from sniffing a National Hockey League start, and with the Bruins using their 2012 first-round pick on another young goalie, Malcolm Subban, ironically Hutchinson's place on the Eastern power's depth chart was slipping with each minute of pro hockey he played.
So when his entry-level deal with the Bruins expired in 2013, Hutchinson says Boston did him a favour by cutting him loose. These words, it must be noted, are said with genuine appreciation; this is not a revenge tale, although Hutchinson's first NHL victory was a 2-1 shootout victory over his former team.(And young Subban did get chased in his own NHL debut Friday.)
“I have a lot of respect for Boston, giving me a chance to try to get on with another organization. It gave me a chance to get into the league with a team that didn't have as much goaltending depth as they did,” Hutchinson explains. “I'm thankful they didn't re-sign me and gave me a shot to come here to Winnipeg.”
Despite the Jets' dearth of talent in the crease, Hutchinson began 2013-14 wearing an Ontario Reign sweater, competing in the league below the league below the league.
A sterling 22-4-2 record in the ECHL accelerated a promotion to the Jets' AHL affiliate, the St. John's IceCaps. And when IceCaps starter Edward Pasquale went down to injury, Hutchinson impressed so much, he got a three-game taste of the NHL late last season.
With the Jets out of the 2014 playoff race, Hutchinson returned to the IceCaps for their post-season run and backstopped them to their first Calder Cup final, posting a .938 save percentage.
That performance under pressure and the sampling of NHL action in a few otherwise meaningless games last April gave Hutchinson confidence heading into training camp – even if this very site ranked him a Tier 7 backup, the lowest.
Hutchinson has obliterated the goal he set for himself in September—just make the team—completing his depth-chart ascent past the blip that was Peter Budaj and the long-term commitment that is Ondrej Pavelec, a goalie who makes $3.325 million more than Hutchinson to do the same job less often and less effectively.
Hutchinson leads all rookies in minutes, wins (17), save percentage (.920) and goals-against average (2.30). But perhaps his most impressive stat—especially in the thick of wild-card battle where every bonus points helps—is that he has stopped all 14 of the 14 shooters he's faced in shootouts.
But don't mention the Calder Trophy consideration to him; he's learned to not count on a thing. Like the rest of his teammates, his goal is to outrace the surging L.A. Kings and Minnesota Wild, to make the playoffs.
“I definitely didn't expect to be playing as much as I have my first year, but at the same time, I try not to overthink things or get ahead of myself,” he says. “If you win games, your stats will even out throughout the year.”
Tonight Hutchinson returns to the arena he felt grateful to visit a couple of times a young hockey fan, making the hour drive south from Barrie. Back then, Hutchinson was a huge Felix Potvin fan.
“He was the first goalie I remember with different pads and a pretty cool mask. As a kid, you're just drawn to that,” Hutchinson says.
“I remember seeing him on the Don Cherry videos making highlight-reel saves. As a kid, those are the types of things you look for.”
It's Hockey Night in Canada, Michael. Don Cherry intermission and all. Fifty friends cheering your name at the ACC.
Who knows? Maybe it'll even go to a shootout.

It's been almost two weeks since Hurricane Matthew ravaged Haiti, killing hundreds and setting the stage for disease and starvation. New photos taken from space reveal the extent of the damage and the disturbing amount of vegetation lost in the storm.
The Category 4 storm brought 107 mph (172 km/h) winds, torrential rainfall, and floods to the poorest nation in the Western Hemisphere, wiping out entire villages, and killing at least 1,000 people. Aerial footage revealed widespread destruction in the western portions of the island nation, but new satellite images taken by the Operational Land Imager on Landsat 8 are showing the true extent of the devastation.

Looking at the gif above, the first image—the one that's mostly green—was taken on September 26, about a week before the storm. The second image was taken on October 12, eight days after Matthew made landfall. The loss of vegetation is striking. It's as if the hurricane came through with a giant scythe and just cut everything down. These pictures show the seaport town of Les Cayes, which according to The New York Times lost more than 90 percent of its buildings.
Even areas that didn't take a direct hit from Matthew experienced tremendous damage, as shown in these images (above) taken of the Grand Place region near the Cavaillon River.

Much of the damage occurred along steep slopes with vegetation and farms, which is a common sight in Haiti. “Generally in Haiti land is managed in very small patches, with a household having subsistence crops in a number of locations, often on steep slopes,” noted ecosystems scientist Alexandra Morel at NASA's Earth Observatory. “When I look at these images, I see what seems to be seriously denuded hillsides, which I assume are from crops and fallows being washed away.”

The storm, in addition to stripping away vegetation, caused a tremendous amount of sediment to pour out of rivers and streams. In this before-and-after image (above), sediment can be seen as the light-brown color at the mouth of the Ravine du Sud.

Sadly, the scale of the damage in Haiti is being underreported because many of the severely hit regions are still cut off. The UN is asking donor nations to respond to the disaster in hopes of curbing a potential cholera epidemic, and to help the many people left displaced, hungry, and injured by the storm.

Update 2: Feel like thumbing through the entire 65 page ruling? FOSS Patents has posted the entire document on Scribd, you'll find it embedded after the break.
As the legal drama between Apple and Samsung drags on around the world, US District Court Judge has rejected Apple's request to block the sales of Galaxy devices. Reuters reports the ruling came out late Friday, with the judge deciding "It is not clear that an injunction on Samsung's accused devices would prevent Apple from being irreparably harmed,". This isn't the first rejection for the folks from Cupertino either, after a request to speed up the trial was also denied back in July . The case itself will of course go on, but this means you'll still be able to get your hands on those Galaxy Tabs, Galaxy S IIs, and the like in the meantime.: While Apple has yet to comment on the ruling, Samsung has issued an official statement which you can check out after the break.File has since been deleted by owner.

WASHINGTON — US authorities wasted no time implementing a new order by President Donald Trump halting Muslim arrivals, detaining travelers arriving at American airports within hours of him signing the measures, media reports said Saturday.
The New York Times reported that airport officials as early as Friday night began detaining travelers, some of whom already had been aboard their flights when Trump announced his executive order.
Two Iraqi men were detained Friday night at John F. Kennedy Airport in New York. One of them had reportedly worked for the US government in Iraq for 10 years and the other was coming to America to join his wife, who had worked for a US contractor.

By Saturday afternoon, a dozen people had been detained, CNN reported.
Travel agents in Tehran said Saturday that foreign airlines were barring Iranians from traveling to the United States following Trump's temporary order barring visas for seven Muslim countries.
Two Tehran agencies told AFP they had been instructed by Etihad Airways, Emirates and Turkish Airlines not to sell US tickets or allow Iranians holding American visas to board US-bound flights.
Trump imposed tough new controls on travelers from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. He said it was part of his promise to protect the United States from Islamic terrorists.
The new US president signed a sweeping executive order on Friday to suspend refugee arrivals and impose tough controls on travelers from the seven countries.
According to Reuters, a Department of Homeland security spokeswoman said that so-called green card holders from the seven muslim-majority countries mentioned in the executive order would be barred from entering the US as well.
“It will bar green card holders,” Gillian Christensen, acting Department of Homeland Security spokeswoman, said in an email.
In the Netherlands, the Dutch flag carrier KLM said it stopped seven passengers from boarding its flights, five of whom it had been able to contact before departure. “We would have liked to have had them fly with us, but it would not have made much sense because they would have been denied entry” to the United States, KLM spokesman Manel Vrijenhoek said.
An Iranian studying in California said she could not now return because her ticket had been cancelled under the new restrictions. “I had a ticket for Turkish Airlines on February 4, but it has been cancelled,” she said from Tehran.
Iran's foreign ministry said it would “respond in kind” and ban Americans, “after the insulting decision of the United States concerning Iranian nationals.” It said the decision was “illegal, illogical and contrary to international rules.” More than a million Iranians live in the United States.
Trump was speaking by phone Saturday with various world leaders, amid growing international alarm and a legal challenge over his moves to drastically limit Muslim immigration and entrance.
In a flurry of telephone calls that started early in the morning and was to last throughout the day, Trump was to speak from the White House with five foreign leaders: Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, Germany's Chancellor Angela Merkel, Russia's President Vladimir Putin, France's President Francois Hollande and Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull.
The conversations give the US president an early opportunity to explain new policies that have baffled and unnerved much of the rest of the world — particularly his order to temporarily halt all refugee arrivals and impose tough controls on travelers from seven Muslim countries including war-wracked Syria.
It also allows him to begin to develop ties with countries that have been close allies with the US in recent history, as well as Russia — a perennial foe, but a country with which Trump has said he is keen to improve relations.
‘Extreme vetting'
Trump's pronouncement on Muslim immigration to the US makes good on one of his most controversial campaign promises to subject travelers from Islamic countries to “extreme vetting,” which he declared would make America safe from “radical Islamic terrorists.”
“This is big stuff,” the new US president declared at the Pentagon on Friday, after signing an executive order entitled “Protection of the nation from foreign terrorist entry into the United States.”
The decree suspends the entire US refugee resettlement program for at least 120 days while tough vetting rules are established.
The new protocols “ensure that those approved for refugee admission do not pose a threat to the security and welfare of the United States.”
In addition, they specifically bar Syrian refugees from the United States indefinitely, or until the president himself decides that they no longer pose a threat.
Meanwhile, no visas will be issued for 90 days to migrants or visitors from the seven mainly Muslim countries: Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen.
The executive order also laid the groundwork for what Trump has pledged will be the “extreme vetting” of visa applicants' backgrounds — with some exceptions made for members of “religious minorities,” a caveat many see as a way to apply favorable treatment to Christians from majority-Muslim states.
US rights group sue
US rights groups filed a legal challenge Saturday to Trump's order. The suit was filed by the American Civil Liberties Union and other advocacy groups after two Iraqi men were detained Friday night at John F. Kennedy Airport in New York. It seeks their release on grounds they are being held unlawfully.
International groups and civil liberties organizations roundly condemned the measures.
“‘Extreme vetting' is just a euphemism for discriminating against Muslims,” said Anthony Romero, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union.
Romero said Trump's order breached the US constitution's ban on religious discrimination by choosing countries with Muslim majorities for tougher treatment.
Ahmed Rehab, director of the Chicago chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations, told AFP his group would mount legal challenges to fight the order “tooth and nail.”
“It is targeting people based on their faith and national origin, and not on their character or their criminality,” he told AFP.
Many foreign leaders, meanwhile, were aghast over the new US policy.
Speaking in Tehran Saturday, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani did not comment directly on the visa ban but said Iran had “opened its doors” to foreign tourists since the signing of a nuclear agreement with world powers in 2015.
Now is “not the time to build walls between nations,” he said, in a reference to Trump's plans to build a wall along the US-Mexico border.
But the US leader did get backing from Czech President Milos Zeman, who praised him for being “concerned with the safety of his citizens.”
Living in an area with high levels of air pollution may increase a woman's chances of having a child with autism, according to the first national study to date that investigates the possible link.
"Women who were exposed to the highest levels of diesel or mercury in the air were twice as likely to have a child with autism than women who lived in the cleanest parts of the sample," study author Andrea Roberts, a research associate with the Harvard School of Public Health, told The Huffington Post.
Earlier studies have established a potential connection between air pollution and autism risk, but have concentrated on a few individual states. The latest study, published in the journal Environmental Health Perspectives on Tuesday, draws on a large sample of women across the whole country.
Researchers crossed U.S. Environmental Protection Agency data on the level of air pollutants from year to year with data from the Nurses' Health Study, one of the longest running investigations of women's health in the U.S. They looked for associations between levels of pollutants in the time and place that a woman was pregnant and whether that woman went on to have a child with a diagnosed autism spectrum disorder.
The researchers split up the locations into fifths, and women who lived in the most polluted sections -- those with the highest levels of diesel particulates or mercury in the air -- were twice as likely to have a child with autism compared to those in the cleanest sections. Other types of air pollution, including lead, manganese and other hard metals, were also linked to a greater risk of autism, although the risk was not quite as high.
"All of the chemicals studied are known neurotoxins," Roberts said. "They are also known to pass from mother to baby while a woman is pregnant. It's very plausible that the 'stuff' the mother is taking in through the air is affecting her baby's brain development."
But the researcher cautioned against reading too much into the results, particularly with regard to mercury. Many parents continue to worry that the form of mercury sometimes used in vaccines is linked to autism -- although that claim has been repeatedly disproven by research efforts.
"Our data is not good enough to know which thing in the air might actually be causing this [link], if it even is something in the air that is increasing the risk of autism," Roberts said. "It might be that it's actually diesel that's [behind] the problem. We are skeptical about the possibility of mercury being causal in this way, through the air."
Alycia Halladay, the senior director for environmental and clinical sciences for the advocacy group Autism Speaks, said that "in terms of how [air pollution] is linked to autism, that's not something we're able to specifically define."
"We can make a lot of hypotheses, but we don't really know," added Halladay, who did not work on the study.
The next step, which would represent a crucial step forward, is to look at blood samples of both mothers and their babies to see what chemicals are actually being absorbed, Roberts said. Only then can researchers assert with any real certainty that the link exists, and begin to understand which specific air pollutants are the most damaging.
The cause of autism is not yet known, although researchers suspect that a combination of genetic and non-genetic factors, such as parental age and complications during pregnancy could all play a role.
For now, there are few specific steps women living in high-pollution areas can take in order to mitigate their risk.
"There are things any doctor or health care professional would tell you to do," Halladay said. Those include eating well, taking a prenatal vitamin, getting regular prenatal health care check-ups and staying away from sick people or viruses as much as possible.
During the latest edition of “Rowdy” Roddy Piper's “Piper's Pit” podcast, the WWE Hall Of Famer told a story about the time Ronda Rousey called him and asked his permission to use the “Rowdy” nickname.
While talking to UFC founder Art Davie on the latest edition of his weekly PodcastOne.com show, “The Hot Rod” spoke about his respect and admiration for the face of Women's MMA, revealing the details of a phone call the two once had where she revealed her intentions to use the “Rowdy” name.
“She did. She called me and asked permission,” said Piper. “She was so sweet. She said, ‘I promise I won't let you down. I'll keep the name in the esteem that it's supposed to be.'”
Piper continued, “And then she put on a little “Hot Rod” t-shirt and kind of little kilt, dress kind of thing and took some publicity pictures.”
Piper went on to call Rousey one of the biggest stars in the sport today and also talked about how they have “Judo” Gene LeBell in common as a mentor.
“Rowdy” Ronda makes the next defense of her UFC Women's Bantamweight Championship against Cat Zingano in the co-main event of UFC 184, which takes place on Saturday, February 28, 2015 at the Staples Center in Los Angeles, California.

Senior Labour figure Sadiq Khan today challenged Boris Johnson to freeze travel fares for cash-strapped Londoners next year.
The shadow justice secretary launched an outspoken attack on what he called the Mayor's “abysmal record of hiking fares”.
His challenge comes days after Londoners learned that rail fares would leap 4.1 per cent in 2014, with some rising even higher.
Giving his first speech since becoming shadow minister for London, the Tooting MP said: “Boris Johnson has an abysmal record of hiking fares year on year that has contributed enormously to the cost-of-living crisis in London.
“London fares are now the most expensive in the world.”
Labour research claims that the price of a single bus ticket rose 56 per cent, from 90p to £1.40, in the five years since Mr Johnson became Mayor. A zone one-to-six annual travelcard increased by £440 to £2,224.
Mr Khan, considered a front-runner to become Labour's candidate for Mayor in 2016, said: “[The Mayor] must recognise that Londoners are struggling and that their budgets can't keep stretching forever.”
He argued that freezing fares would be cheap compared with cash “wasted on the Mayor's vanity projects”, such as the £354,500 “Boris Buses”.
A spokesperson for the Mayor of London said Boris Johnson was determined to keep fares low, but that investment in the transport system is vital to deliver better services.
He also pointed out that Mr Johnson had “fought hard” to secure nearly £100 million from the Government to help lower fares in 2013.
“The Mayor has kept fares in the capital lower than anywhere else in the country, while protecting all free and concessionary travel for older people, students, veterans and disabled Londoners, “ he said.
“He will make a decision on fares for 2014 later this year but has publicly stated that he is determined to bear down on them as much as possible.”
NASHUA, N.H. (CBS) – Investigators say, so far, there is no evidence of foul play in the death of a 15-month-old boy at an unlicensed day care in Nashua, New Hampshire.
Police were called to a home on Ash Street Wednesday afternoon and found the toddler “not breathing, unresponsive and bluish-grayish in color,” according to Nashua Police Lt. Kerry Baxter.
When first responders arrived the young boy was in the arms of an adult.
“They didn't have much to say. They were just panicked over the fact the child was unresponsive and not breathing and obviously in distress,” Baxter told WBZ-TV Friday.
The child was rushed to the hospital but died a short time later.
“It does not appear, based on evidence that we have and the autopsy results that there's anything suspicious about this. There's no trauma to the child,” said Baxter.
The cause of death is still under investigation.
Police said a number of other kids were inside looking on as all of this was unfolding Wednesday. Their ages ranged from 7 months to 14 years old. Several of them were the homeowners' children, but police estimated 4 or 5 of them were not.
That led investigators to conclude the home was operating as a day care, identified as “The Kinder Garden” on Facebook.
“We have confirmed with the child care licensing unit up at the state that it does not have a license to operate a day care and based on the information that we have, it's pretty evident they were running a day care business out of there,” Baker told WBZ.
The Department of Health and Human Services said in a statement that The Kinder Garden has no current license, and there is no record of the facility every applied for a license.
A letter was immediately sent to the facility to cease operations.
In 2013, DHHS officials received an anonymous complaint about The Kinder Garden, alleging that the facility was carding for more than three children in addition to the owner's children.
Investigators made unannounced visits three times in four weeks, there was no evidence of childcare being provided.
No complaints were received after 2013.
A record of a founded complaint exists from 2008, but electronic records are not available before 2009. DHHS officials said paper records are kept for four years.
“When a complaint is founded, meaning there was evidence of unlawful behavior, DHHS policy is to issue a letter requiring ceasing of operations and conduct an unannounced follow-up investigation. That is likely what occurred in 2008,” DHHS said in a statement.
“This is a tragic event and DHHS is closely following the Nashua Police Department's investigation and will take additional action as appropriate.”
No other information is available at this point in the investigation.
Hello Rocksmith fans!
@Dan Amrich's clue has been solved and it's been confirmed that next week's DLC will be our second repeat artist song pack. Yes, back February of 2014 we got our first pack from @TheDoors and here we are in September 2015 with yet another three pack!
Let's take a look at the clue.
Using the Pigpen Cipher and some colour organization we translated this phrase
“These voices – they are a kind of bridge back to the human world”
Which is a direct quote from Aldous Huxley's “Doors of Perception” which The Doors are named after!
So we know it's a three pack and we've already taken care of Light My Fire, Roadhouse Blues, and Riders on The Storm…
It's on Rock Band 3 so why not?
This time for sure… Right folks?
Wishful thinking to be honest.
What songs are you hoping to see in the second coming of @TheDoors? Is this the trip back to the 60's you were hoping for? Let us know!
Ka Leo O Hawaii isn't just a student newspaper; it's your free weekly report about activities at one of the biggest taxpayer investments in the state, the University of Hawaii. No one in the world can cover this public institution better than the independent student journalists embedded within – and constantly circulating – its systems. For that reason alone, it deserves robust financial support.
As a metaphor, though, Ka Leo should be considered more of an experimental public garden than an executive report. It's the distinctively protected place, like a greenhouse, in our society where we plant citizenry seeds and either nurture the emerging hybrid species or strangle them.
Students return to UH this week for the start of the fall semester, with eyes bulging at opportunities offered throughout its campuses. UH Manoa, alone, has 280 registered independent organizations (clubs), plus various chartered student groups, such as the Associated Students of the University of Hawaiʻi (ASUH, aka student government), KTUH (an island-wide radio station broadcast on FM-90.1, 91.1 on the North Shore) and Ka Leo, which this month requested an increase in student fees for the student newspaper, the first such request since the 1980s. With a circulation of 10,000 printed copies weekly, Ka Leo is one of the largest and most visible media sources on Oahu.

This past decade has been a disaster for the newspaper business model, decimating a generation of journalists in the process. Yet similar to what happened during the fall of Nixon, the latest presidential attack on the Fourth Estate has generated a strong counter-wave of support for what journalists do, particularly for industry leaders such as The New York Times, The Washington Post and CNN.
While this wave of civic interest has not yet reached the levels of most local and regional news organizations, I'm eager to report that we have been witnessing a recent surge of interest at UH, too, which offers the only journalism major within 2,400 miles.
Our introductory journalism class increased enrollment this fall by about 40 percent, and the path to a celebrated career at The New York Times, or wherever, invariably starts for students in just such a survey course and through participating in student media, like Ka Leo or KTUH. Many – if not most – of the professional journalists in our community right now worked at Ka Leo.
As part of an apprenticeship system, every journalist I know spent at least some time in service of a college newspaper. As an occupation, journalists don't have licenses or credentialing exams. They have the student-newspaper gauntlet, in which only the best and most-devoted practitioners survive and thrive.
I am one of those, for example, who came to a university unsure of what I wanted to do with my career and life. I had excelled in math and thought accounting might be my calling, until I spent a significant amount of time sorting and categorizing receipts.
Trying to become the first person in my family to graduate from a university, I was wandering in the intellectual wilderness my sophomore year when I enrolled in a basic newswriting course and, as part of reading the student newspaper for class, kept complaining about how terrible the publication was performing.
My journalism instructor, Roberta Kelly, in a moment that I still remember vividly to this day, challenged me to “go down there and show ‘em how to do it.” So I did, only to be immediately shocked and humbled by how difficult journalism actually was to practice in public.
Those next few years writing for the student newspaper honed my skills and opened my mind to what I could contribute to public discourse. Only a few of us in that cohort ended up working as professional journalists, but just like other expansive liberal-arts fields, such as sociology, psychology, history, geography, English, etc., vocational placement isn't the only goal of a program; perpetuating the ideology is the most important part.
If you believe in fairness and justice, if you believe in holding the most powerful people in society most accountable, if you believe in unadulterated and unvarnished truth, then you follow the journalistic ideology (which is sometimes separate and independent of the business interests of the news “industry”). If you prescribe to this ideology, then more training and practice in it only will make your grasp of the ideology and adherence to it stronger.
The journalism faculty at UH, of which I am a part, recently generated objectives for our graduation-day deliverables in our students that included the following pledge, as a promise to anyone who wants to hire our graduates:
“Our students are aggressive, ethical, culturally adaptable and worldly do-gooders. … They know how to write well. They know the laws that govern public communication. They are tech-savvy. They are proficient with both a video and still-image camera, feeling comfortable on both sides of the screen. Ultimately, they create high-fidelity media that promotes an open and transparent democracy.”
Cory Lum/Civil Beat
Such an ethic transcends traditional media work – although there's nothing wrong with that, either – to bring the journalistic ideology into all kinds of workplaces that our students end up embodying, including teachers in classrooms, government spokespeople in public meetings and lawyers in courtrooms.
In our heavily networked and digital society, every business is a communication business, and all communication benefits from the fundamentals skills of journalism, such as accurately gathering information from all sides, making sense of that information and then reporting it back to others in efficient and effective ways.
Journalism, like the Scientific Method, is more of a process than a product, as a way to seek truth and share it widely, which is why students from all fields could benefit from taking at least a few journalism classes. Journalism studies can help students in the arts or sciences or engineering or medicine, or countless other fields, communicate with members of the general public about the technical issues they really care the most about, from as many angles and in as much depth as a person desires.
Because the student newspaper is independent from the formal journalism program, it has the potential to attract diverse voices, with different interests, from various fields, into a single forum. This garden of ideas shouldn't need to justify itself for student-fee support any more than student government does. They are inextricably linked, in our grand-experiment model of Democracy, and without a free and independent press, democratic discourse cannot survive any more than plants without water.
Ka Leo has persevered for nearly a century because of such self-evident truths about the value of a student newspaper. Without it – and it is threatened right now by economic stresses – journalism will be weaker in Hawaii, and you will know less and less about the major investments taxpayers make – and decisions administrators make – in higher education.
This student fee increase seems like a reasonable request, but in addition to giving Ka Leo more money, I hope that community members – and UH students in particular – think deeply about the opportunities a vibrant student newspaper affords our community. I hope you carefully consider where society would be without its journalists and news organizations, from student publications to The Washington Post.
If you aren't exceptionally pleased with what you get from the local newspaper, this is your chance, get involved, go down there and show 'em how to do it.
The University of California earlier this week released a detailed report on UC admissions, finances and transparency.
The UC publication, Straight Talk on Hot-Button Issues, counters assertions about the university made by the California State Auditor's office in an report released in March.
The university took the unusual step of issuing an in-depth response to the state findings “because it strongly believed the state audit consistently failed to consider key facts and data during the audit process,” UC wrote in a March 29 press release.
Straight Talk on Hot-Button Issues provides data demonstrating how the university's policies and practices favor California resident students. The UC report also affirms that the university has always adhered to the Master Plan for Higher Education by offering spaces to all eligible California students who apply to UC. It also discusses how its stewardship of public funds is equitable and transparent.
This year the university will expand its commitment to Californians by enrolling 5,000 more in-state undergraduates than in 2014-15. It plans to enroll an additional 5,000 California undergraduates in the following two years.

The FAQ below addresses some key concerns.
* * *
Frequently Asked Questions
What is the difference between all of the types of GPAs?
Capped and weighted GPA: More rigorous courses result in a “bump” in GPA — a B+ in an AP history class receives more grade points than a B+ in a standard history class. Only certain rigorous courses are eligible for this “bump.”

All honors/AP/IB/college level courses are considered.
More rigorous courses result in a “bump” in GPA — a B+ in an AP history class receives more grade points than a B+ in a standard history class. honors/AP/IB/college level courses are considered. Unweighted GPA: All letter grades are equivalent — a B+ in an AP history class receives as many grade points as a B+ in a standard history class.
But doesn't the audit chart titled “In recent academic years, most campuses have admitted domestic nonresident undergraduates with lower weighted grade point averages than residents they admitted” show Berkeley as admitting out-of-state students with lower GPAs?
The audit chart shows capped weighted GPAs. One of three measures of GPA, this measure deflates out-of-state students' GPAs, as it doesn't account for all of their honors/AP/IB/college-level courses. While only this GPA was analyzed by the audit, UC Berkeley considers uncapped weighted GPA and unweighted GPA in their file review.
How important is GPA in determining an offer of admission?
UC Berkeley uses GPA in addition to 13 other factors in each application file. “Holistic review” refers to the process of evaluating applications in their entirety by professionally trained readers. Every application is read at least twice by two professionally trained readers, and many applications are read three times.
The admission holistic review reflects our readers' thoughtful consideration of the full spectrum of the applicant's qualifications, based on all evidence provided in the application, and viewed in the context of the applicant's academic and personal circumstances and the overall strength of the Berkeley applicant pool.
Using a broad concept of merit, readers evaluate academic work; personal qualities like leadership ability, character, tenacity, initiative or intellectual independence; likely contributions to campus; performance on standard tests; and other measures of achievement including extracurricular, volunteer or employment experience. This holistic review enables us to admit a diverse undergraduate class representing 53 states/commonwealths and 74 countries, with 17 percent who are first-generation college-going and 65 percent who receive financial aid.
The audit mentions “compare favorably.” What does that mean?
“Compare favorably” is a guidance for admissions offices to ensure that out-of-state students are just as — if not more — prepared to succeed as in-state students. The audit expresses preference for a Master Plan definition approach that was established in the 1960s.

More than twice the 800,000 young adult illegal immigrants in the Obama-era deportation deferral program are eligible for it, according to a new report out on the eve of President Trump's decision on extending it.
At 1.9 million eligible for Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, the total population is large enough to make the fifth largest city in America, behind Houston.
Using its own "demographic methodology" to determine the size of the DACA population, the Migration Policy Institute said that as of 2016 "there were 1.9 million unauthorized immigrants potentially eligible for DACA."
Prior estimates went only as high as 1.1 million.
MPI, however, reported that there are 1.3 million who meet all of the eligibility criteria, which covers when they arrived and education and employment requirements. Then it adds in 398,000 illegals who meet all but the education requirement, but could. And finally, MPI adds 228,000 children who arrived in the U.S. younger than the minimum age of 15 but "will age into eligibility provided they stay in school."
On Friday, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services said that some 790,000 young "dreamers" have received work permits and deportation relief through DACA since it was created five years ago.
The Pew Research Center explained the program this way:
It gives unauthorized immigrants who came to the U.S. before age 16 – a group sometimes called "Dreamers" – a chance to stay in the U.S. to study or work, provided they meet certain conditions such as being enrolled in high school or having a high school degree or GED equivalent, and not having a serious criminal conviction. Those approved for the program are given a work permit and protection from deportation for two years, and these benefits can be renewed.
Trump is reportedly leaning against extending the program. He is to announce his decision Tuesday. During the presidential campaign, he promised to kill it.
Republican and Democratic lawmakers, however, are urging him to extend it, worried it would result in the deportation of many who have lived most of their lives in the U.S.

High import tariff key concer­n, TFA provis­ions could help Pakist­an reduce trade costs by 13%
ISLAMABAD: The government deserves praise for bringing stability and discipline to the economy.
The growth outlook for current financial year is at 4.5% as compared to 4.2% in the preceding period. The current account is in a healthy position where in the preceding few months it has shown a surplus compared to deficit. Also, workers' remittances have shown vigorous trends.
Pakistani textiles take a hit, orders drop 50%
The cynics may like to point out that it was more to the luck of the government than the policies that brought about the ‘economic space' for the present government.
The fall in the prices of crude oil was a relief to countries like Pakistan that are energy deficient and spend considerable foreign exchange resources on oil.
Moreover, the present government subscribed to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) programme for accessing credit with stringent conditions that also brought about some semblance of fiscal discipline in the economy.
Least effect on exports
But despite all these efforts, the export sector is lagging behind. It was expected that low interest rates and reduction in energy prices would create a conducive environment for the country's exports to perform well but current figures do not portray a very optimistic picture.
It is expected that the export figures for current financial year will be 14% less than compared to last year. The policymakers blame it on the global economic downturn due to slowdown in the Chinese economy that brought the commodity prices to downward spiral.
The World Bank, in its latest Pakistan Development Report, has discussed this issue and believes that it has more to do with the structural defects in the economy.
Pakistan's export competiveness has diminished due to protectionist policies, poor infrastructure, and high transaction costs for trade. Consequently, Pakistan exports-to-GDP ratio is declining for the last two decades. It has reduced from 13.5 % in 1995 to 10.5% in 2015. This year it is expected to reach around 10%. Pakistan's overall market share in global trade is also coming down and the country is losing its share at an average of 1.5% annually over the past decade.
Removing structural defects
Pakistan will be required to undertake some bitter policy prescriptions to address structural defects in the economy that would help its export sector improve its competitiveness.
EU pushes Pakistan to focus on leather exports
One of the important areas of concern with the experts has been high import tariffs in Pakistan. Like many developing countries nascent protection is dear to the policymakers in Pakistan. In reality, it is limited fiscal space more than the protection of domestic industry that is responsible in contributing to high import tariffs. Pakistan relies on considerably for revenue generation by taxing international trade. The share of import taxes to the total revenue collection of Pakistan is as much as 46%.
Pakistan is the world's seventh most restrictive and protected economy, according to Overall Trade Restrictiveness Index compiled by the World Bank. The high tariffs have undermined the potential of Pakistan's domestic industry in integrating with global value chain where global firms have fragmented their manufacturing processes to various geographical locations. According to the World Trade Organisation's (WTO) estimate 35% of global trade is of intermediately and semi-finished goods and high import tariffs erode competitiveness of domestic firms in benefiting from global value chains.
Pakistan has also slipped in the ranking on the ease of doing business indicator. This has created further disadvantages for the export industry in Pakistan and enhanced their transaction costs.
TFAs
The other important aspect for enhancing trade competiveness is the implementation of Trade Facilitation Agreement (TFA) signed by the WTO members in 2014.
WTO Secretary General Roberto Azvedo recently visited Pakistan and advised the policymakers to take ambitious positions in implementing the TFA provisions that could help Pakistan reduce trade costs as much as 13%. The WTO is of the view that TFA will have a much bigger impact than eliminating the import tariff globally. This would also help countries like Pakistan integrate with the global value chains.
To address the declining exports, the Ministry of Commerce has undertaken a number of initiatives for trade promotion. The recently held Textile Expo Pakistan brought textile buyers from major markets for Business-to-Business collaboration. The Commerce Ministry is also planning road shows in the Central Asian Republics to promote Pakistan's exports to these regions.

The aggressive trade promotion strategy without addressing the structural issues in the economy may not provide sustainable growth.

In his remarks Monday, Obama also made a brief reference to LGBT rights in the workplace, saying his agenda included building an economy that “gives every American the chance to get ahead … no matter … who you love.” But some noted Obama has so far refused to heed calls to sign an executive order banning federal contractors from discriminating against workers on the basis of their sexual orientation or gender identity. Last week, first lady Michelle Obama was confronted over her husband's failure to take such action by a protester who interrupted her speech at a private fundraiser in Washington. Michelle Obama responded angrily and threatened to leave.
Michelle Obama: “And I don't care what you believe in. We don't — wait, wait, wait. One of the things I — one of the things that I don't do well is this. … I can take the mic, but I'm leaving. So, you all decide.”
Crowd: “No, no!”
Ellen Sturtz: “I need your husband to sign…”
Unidentified Woman: “No, please don't leave.”
The protest action divided some progressives. Some criticized the protester, Ellen Sturtz, saying there were racial overtones when she said she was “taken aback” that Michelle Obama “came right down in my face,” in response to the interruption. Anthea Butler, a professor of religious studies at the University of Pennsylvania, said: “Media coverage also played along, portraying the First Lady as the aggressor rather than Sturtz. … Such a characterization read instantly to many as an exhibition of white privilege. Similar statements of any black person 'stepping out of their place' in the 19th and 20th centuries resulted in beatings and lynchings.”
After months of heartfelt debate, over 3.2 million voters in the Republic of Ireland are expected to take part in the country's historic referendum on same-sex marriage on Friday.
Queues were reported outside some polling stations in Dublin and Galway before doors opened at 7am on Friday, and voter turnout was higher than previous referendums, as recorded late afternoon on Friday.
Counting begins on Saturday and a result is expected later that day. Although polls predict a majority Yes vote by 60-75 per cent, those in favour aren't taking any chances. The Yes campaign has been encouraging all eligible emigrants - an estimated 60,000 people - to travel home to vote, as there is no option to vote by post.
Dublin's airport and London's Euston station, amongst others, were even busier than usual on Friday morning and on the days running up to the vote, as people flocked back to Dublin in time for the polls closing at 10pm on Friday evening.

'18 month' rule
Physically showing up at a polling station is the only way Irish nationals living abroad can vote. Irish legislation is also strict when it comes to permissions on emigrants returning to vote: Irish citizens living abroad can only take part if they have left the country less than 18 months previously.
But these restrictions have only made those eligible even more determined to get back on Irish soil. Dubliner Mark Govern who is now living in Australia hit the headlines after emptying his bank account to book a 9,600 mile flight home to vote Yes, while Twitter-friendly messages like #hometovote and "Be my Yes" have spread like wildfire on social media as voters tweeted pictures of themselves boarding planes, trains and boats on their journey home.
Within Ireland, taxi company Uber is offering two free taxi journeys to take Dubliners to the polls and back.

60,000 abroad eligible to vote
Recent population data puts the number of Irish nationals who left the country within 18 months at an estimated 60,000. The votes of recent emigrants may be most significant to the Yes vote: a poll by the Irish Students' Union found that 90 per cent intend to vote Yes.
Joey Kavanagh, 29, who works in arts administration in London, set up the “Get the Boat 2 Vote” to encourage Irish abroad to use their vote, even if the cost of a flight was prohibitive.
“The sad reality is that a lot of people who emigrated are young graduates,” he said, “and opinion polls suggest that young people are more likely to vote ‘yes'.”

'I've been shouted at for holding hands with someone'
Although an Ipsos MRBI survey for the Irish Times put the Yes vote at 70 per cent, the result is by no means secured. If the UK's recent general election wasn't enough of a warning not to trust the polls, Ireland's 1995 referendum on divorce passed by just 0.6 per cent, despite opinion polls beforehand suggesting that around 70 per cent would vote yes.
The campaign against same-sex marriage, led mainly by the Catholic Church, has been largely centered on the issue of parenthood.
The No campaign says that children should have a biological right to a father and mother, and that the legislation being proposed will threaten this and redefine the institution of marriage.
Oonagh Murphy, 28, resident director at The Apollo theatre in London's West End, who is travelling with the “Get the Vote” crew doesn't agree.
Murphy is gay, and says that when she told friends and family in Ireland, she noticed a tangible shift in the way people talked to her about the future, marriage and babies. “Often in conversation, it seemed others believed those things were no longer considered available to me, since I didn't identify as straight any more,” she said.
“If we could shift the perception of what constitutes a relationship, what makes a parent, what the qualities of a good childhood are, and be more open in our ideas about gender and sexuality, we could create a different type of society.”
For Shaun Dunne, 26, a Yes vote would be life-changing. "I've been shouted at for holding hands with someone," he said. "I've been nearly attacked a few times. But I've also experienced the subtler forms of homophobia. The insinuations, the insensitive questions, the stares."
'I will have serious reservations about rushing back'
For many of Ireland's emigrants, the same-sex referendum is about more than one single change to legislation: it is about the kind of country Ireland is becoming - and whether it's one that they want to return to.
Lorcan O'Cathain, founder of Change Ireland, which is helping to fund emigrants journeys home to vote, says the referendum will send a clear message about Irish society, for better or worse.
"There are often these images of Ireland as this European backwater, stuck in the dark days of suffocating religious conformity," says O'Cathain, 23, from Athlone. "A No vote will reinforce this view and be hugely damaging to Ireland's image internationally and possibly indeed to the entire equality movement as it picks up across the world... This is our chance to send a clear message to the rest of the world about the type of society we are in Ireland and I wouldn't miss it for the world."

Sarah Fox, a product designer in her late 30s, who is setting sail to Sandycove, Dublin to vote agrees. Although she describes herself as “happily married” to a man, she is passionate about voting for “equal treatment for everyone” and echoes what many pro-Yes emigrants feel about the outcome:
“If the Yes side aren't successful in this referendum I will have serious reservations about rushing back, as it will be a clear message that the perception of a modern, forward thinking Ireland is an illusion.”
On any given Thursday night, a group of about 65 people from the LGBT community gather in the music suite of National City Christian Church to square dance with their friends.
But don't expect to see cowboy hats, prairie skirts or couples doing the “Dosey Doe.” These square dancers dress casually, have no couple requirements, allow all-positioning dancing and the caller is using a Lady Gaga song.
One thing's for sure: This is not your grandparents' square dancing.
Since 1982, the D.C. Lambda Squares have been bringing a level of excitement and energy to the dance floor that was once unheard of in the square dance community.
“It was founded by a group of gay men and lesbians who wanted to square dance but at the time, straight clubs were non-accepting of same-sex couples square dancing, or people dancing other than in their traditional position,” says Joe Harr, president of the D.C. Lambda Squares. “They formed this club so they could dance the way they wanted to.”
Today, the club is open to young and old, singles or couples and beginners or advanced dancers. Anyone interested can visit the group online.
“My favorite part is the people involved are very welcoming and open and it's just a relaxed atmosphere,” Harr says. “There are various gay square dance clubs throughout the U.S., and an international association and many people take part in other weekend dances.”
In addition to D.C. Lambda Squares' regular Thursday-night get-together, which meets from 7:30 to 9:30 p.m. in D.C. at National City Christian Church (5 Thomas Circle, NW), eight times a year, the club holds a community dance at Francis Scott Key Middle School (910 Schindler Dr.) in Silver Spring, Md.
In honor of the organization's 30th anniversary, the Lambda Squares are holding a party Saturday at Francis Scott Key Middle School with Doren McBroom set to call.
“A 30th anniversary is the pearl anniversary, so we are telling everyone to wear pearls for this event,” Harr says. “Our last community dance was a beach theme so people came in their bathing suits. We expect everyone to have a great time.”
Other regular callers are Dayle Hodge and club members Kent Forester and Brian Jarvis.
John Burlison, a former club president who has been a member since 2000, has watched the club's membership ebb and flow over the last dozen years and is happy that interest is on the upswing.
“The people I learned with was the largest class for many years but we went through a time when it was very difficult to find new members,” Burlison says. “That appears to be slowly changing, as in recent years people have rediscovered square dancing as a fun activity and a great way to meet people.”
Membership coordinator Joe Branch learned of the group from seeing them perform at a Pride festival three years ago and has helped spearhead bringing the group to other events around the area, such as Gay Day at the Hillwood Museum this past year.
“What we try to do is perform at Pride and try to find other venues to do demos, hold open houses and try to perform at different community events to get people interested in square dancing,” Branch says. “Square dancing is a delightful activity full of wonderful people. I think the D.C. Lambda Squares is the friendliest group of people I have ever met.”
Many of the members have been with the group for at least 10 years, and this is designated with a special bar that they put on their membership badge. This past year, the group had to order some 20-year bars to commemorate those that have been involved since the early '90s.
“Those who were here at the beginning did wear traditional western wear, and that has been the biggest change, since we wear what we are comfortable in,” Harr says. “For us, it's not about living up to a certain square dancing cliché, we are all about having fun.”
Cindy Scharf has been going to Lambda Squares since 1997, learning about the group from a friend.
“I got involved initially to get some exercise and to meet some women in the LGBT community, and I ended up meeting a lot of good friends,” she says. “After a hard day of work, to come in and see so many smiling faces is really uplifting.”
Not only did Scharf make lots of new friends, but her going had a monumental impact on her life.
“I met my wife Olivia there,” she says. “It's an organization that is open to singles and you don't need a partner to dance. People are willing to dance with you. It's not partnered up in the way the straight dancing is. A lot of people have met the people they are with through square dancing.”
One of her favorite things about the club is that the music isn't what you would normally think of when you hear the term “square dancing.” That's another of the positive changes through the years.
“I think there is a misconception that people who square dance tend to dance only to country-western music,” she says, “but the callers have a variety of music from different genres and some relatively modern things.”
Scharf and her wife also use their involvement in square dancing to help them decide on vacations.
“One of the things that we both enjoy about it is that we travel around a lot,” she says. “Every year there's an annual convention and we use that as an excuse to travel to different places that we might not otherwise have in our sights to go to.”
Both Scharf and Burlison have fond memories of the 20th anniversary party and are looking forward to the fun night that the 30th promises, as well.
“We're expecting to have some old friends and members who haven't been here for a while come out for the night,” Harr says. “Remember, before the Internet, people had to actually go out of their houses to meet people and have fun. Square dancing is a great thing for people who love to dance to blow off steam, interact with other members and visit with their friends.”

Friday, February 12th, 2016 (8:48 am) - Score 1,915
A team of researchers working out of the University College London have given fibre optic communications technology a further boost by achieving the highest data throughput ever reported (1.125 Terabits per second) for a single coherent optical receiver.
Some reports have perhaps characterised this record incorrectly and indeed we have seen significantly faster fibre optic networks before, such as the effort in 2014 by Dutch scientists to push an astonishing 255Tbps (Terabits per second) over a single 1km long link (here). But that required a completely new network and a 7 core fibre optic cable.
However the key piece of information in today's news is that a new bit rate of 1.125Tbps was attained by using a single receiver, which in reality represents a modest increase of 12.5% relative to the previous record that achieved 1Tbps. The previous record harnessed a spectrally sliced transmitter and a digital coherent receiver with an optical bandwidth of 125GHz.
The latest achievement made use of a 15 sub-carrier 8 GBd DP-256QAM super-channel (15 channels of data) and the total bandwidth of this “super-channel” came out as 121.5GHz, which was within the 125GHz capability of their digital coherent receiver.
Dr Robert Maher, UCL Electronic & Electrical Engineering, said: “While current state-of-the-art commercial optical transmission systems are capable of receiving single channel data rates of up to 100 Gigabits per second (Gb/s), we are working with sophisticated equipment in our lab to design the next generation core networking and communications systems that can handle data signals at rates in excess of 1 Terabit per second (Tb/s). For comparison this is almost 50,000 times greater than the average speed of a UK broadband connection of 24 megabits per second (Mb/s), which is the current speed defining “superfast” broadband. Using high-bandwidth super-receivers enables us to receive an entire super-channel in one go. Super-channels are becoming increasingly important for core optical communications systems, which transfer bulk data flows between large cities, countries or even continents. However, using a single receiver varies the levels of performance of each optical sub-channel so we had to finely optimise both the modulation format and code rate for each optical channel individually to maximise the net information data rate. This ultimately resulted in us achieving the greatest information rate ever recorded using a single receiver.”
Granted the improvement of 12.5% over the last record might not seem all that huge, although when multiplied via a bigger network it could become much more significant and even on a single receiver you're still talking about pushing an extra 125Gbps (Gigabits per second), which is nothing to sniff about.
The team further claims that there is room for “significant future increases,” although this is reliant on the continual development of Digital-to-Analogue Converters (DAC), Analogue-to-Digital Converters (ADC) and implementable capacity-approaching FEC codes.
However it appears as if the performance achieved above was only shown when directly connecting the transmitter and receiver, which is good for a lab test but kind of ignores the need that most networks have for a long piece of fibre optic cable.
The next approach will thus be to test all of these improvements and measure the achievable data rates in a long distance transmission scenario, where optical signals can become distorted as they travel through thousands of kilometres of optical fibres (e.g. international sub-sea fibre optic links).
Story highlights Texas Gov. Rick Perry has been indicted on accusations he abused his power
Charges stem from his threat to cut program run by a local DA unless she resigned
Both Perry and the DA got mug shots -- hers for drunk driving charge
But while she's back at work, he has to defend himself against felony charges
She was the one caught driving drunk, but in an odd twist of political fate, he's now the one who has just been indicted on felony charges.
On the face of it, you might think that Rosemary Lehmberg, district attorney for Travis County in Texas, would be out of her job after being caught driving under the influence, haranguing those who took her in, being convicted and serving 20 days in jail.
But it's her bitter political rival Texas Gov. Rick Perry who's now facing serious charges for how he reacted to what she did.
Here are four reasons why Perry -- a possible candidate for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination -- is in more trouble than the district attorney caught driving with a 0.239 blood alcohol level, nearly three times the state's legal limit.
Walking the line
She failed miserably to walk a straight line in a field sobriety test, but he's accused of crossing a political legal line.

Perry joined others calling for Lehmberg to step down after her DWI arrest. But when she refused, he threatened to and then did withhold funding for a program run by Lehmberg -- a powerful Democrat in a heavily Republican state.
Talking the talk
In her drunken state, with a blood alcohol level of 0.239, Lehmberg mouthed off to officers and jailers. Perry let money do the talking. He threatened to use his veto power to cut state funding for a special unit in Lehmberg's control -- the Office of Public Integrity -- if she did not step down after her conviction.
Lehmberg would not budge, so Perry pulled the $3.5 million in annual state funding for the unit, which ironically investigates wrongdoing by public officials across Texas.
Perry has the right to veto whatever he likes, but threatening to do so to get something he wanted was illegal, according to Texans for Public Justice, a liberal group that filed the complaint against Perry.
Location, location, location
A blueberry in a bowl of tomato soup. That's what Perry calls Travis County, where Democrats like Lehmberg reign. The county, home of the state capital, Austin, is a spot of blue in an overwhelmingly red state. In 2012, Travis County voted for President Obama while the rest of the state overwhelmingly went for Mitt Romney.
The members of the grand jury that approved the indictment were selected from that Democratic county, but those involved in the legal case say their decision had nothing to do with politics. CNN spoke to several grand jurors, and they said politics never entered their secret discussions. One did add though that the decision to indict the governor was not unanimous. They said the special prosecutor, Mike McCrum, was fair and demonstrated how the governor violated the law.
The law
Lehmberg pleaded guilty to DWI, served nearly three weeks in jail, went to rehab and then went back to her job as the district attorney, able to ignore the calls for her to step down. The felony charges against Perry are much more serious and would not allow him such latitude were he to be found guilty. He faces one count of abuse of official capacity and one count of coercion of a public servant, with the maximum sentence for both at more than 100 years in prison.
Perry calls the charges an "injustice." "The actions I took were not only lawful and legal but right," he told reporters at the Travis County Court, where he appeared voluntarily to have his mugshot and fingerprints taken.
Indeed, legal analysts, including CNN's Jeffrey Toobin, a former federal prosecutor, question the indictment. "The governor has the power to veto this money," Toobin said. "So, the question is, how can it be a crime to threaten to use a power that is entirely within the powers of your office?"
Perry is now in his last few months in office after his 14 years in the governor's mansion. Speculation that he's eyeing the White House continues, but he may well have to solve this court case first.
It's hackneyed and it is true: The outcome of the 2016 election will hinge on turnout.
I legitimately hate to say that because it's such a cop-out. You're on a campaign that's probably going to lose but needs to get volunteers to come and phone bank? Remind the press that it all comes down to turnout! Yes, you're saying that the results depend on which voters vote, which is not exactly ground-breaking. But it's also true, in the way that hackneyed comments can often be.
To reinforce that, I can point to an interesting pair of graphs from the New York Times' Florida poll that was released on Monday, conducted with Siena College. The first graph shows how views of the two major-party candidates vary by the likelihood that a voter will go to the polls -- and the second weights those results by that likelihood.
Hillary Clinton has big leads among a lot of those infrequent voters, but Donald Trump's lead with those most likely to vote makes a much bigger difference.
The most recent Post-ABC News poll offered a similar result. For Clinton, 80 percent of her supporters who were registered to vote identified themselves as "certain" to cast a ballot, with another 9 percent saying they would probably do so. For Trump, the figures were 93 percent and 5 percent, respectively.
Part of this is due to the fact that demographics that tend to support Republicans also tend to vote more often. Retirees, people with steady jobs and people who own their own homes are frequent voters because they don't have to re-register to vote after moving as much and they can make time to get to the polls. Those demographics overlap with income, and therefore race: It's usually older, wealthier and whiter voters who vote more reliably. And those are voters that often vote Republican.
There's variation within the numbers, though, that can affect this race in particular. Let's look at data from three Post-ABC polls: One taken in Sept. 2012, our poll from August and our most recent poll. We've broken out several demographic groups by age, race and education, looking only at responses among registered voters.
Some things to note in that:
Between the August and September Post-ABC poll, there was a 5-point jump among whites without college degrees in their saying that they were certain to go vote. It had been at the same levels as in Sept. 2012.
The increase since August among white men without degrees was 11 points -- while the percent of white women with degrees who said they were certain to vote fell by 8 points.
Among nonwhite voters, the percent that said they were certain to vote in Sept. 2012 was 77 percent; now, it's 72 percent.
Nonwhite voters with college degrees are the most likely to say they're certain to vote, but they're a much smaller percentage of the voting population.
Again, this is largely in line with the long-term trend. Hispanics turnout in presidential elections at about the rate whites turn out in off-year races. Only in 2012 and 2016 did black voters turn out at the same levels as white voters. That discrepancy is one reason that Republicans have recently fared better in non-presidential election years. But it's not entirely in line with that trend, particularly given the fluctuations you see above. If college-educated women (who like Clinton) decide to stay home and white men without degrees (who love Trump) don't, that changes things, even if white voters overall are about the same percent of the electorate.
The inherent turnout advantage enjoyed by Republicans is one reason that the Democrats often have much stronger voter-turnout operations, which Clinton will need this year. When your voters regularly vote, as the GOP's do, you have less of a need to build processes that will ensure they do so. Donald Trump's campaign doesn't seem to be putting much emphasis on turnout, opting instead to hand things over to the Republican Party. The party is confident that it has a good system in place, though it hasn't been tested in a presidential election year.
Underlying all of this is a broader question: Can Donald Trump's candidacy somehow reverse the trend in the diversity of the electorate? A few weeks ago, we made an interactive showing that with the electorate that turned out in 1980, the 10-point margin between Trump and Clinton (as it existed at the time) became a margin of zero. If Clinton turns out more black and Hispanic voters in Florida, the 1-point race that Siena and the Times found tips in her direction. If Trump turns out more of those white men without college degrees, it tips the other way.
Pollsters spend a lot of time trying to predict that turnout for precisely this reason. In 2012, a lot of polls underestimated the number of nonwhite voters who would come out, and so underestimated the extent of President Obama's victory. Knowing that the race comes down to turnout isn't the same as knowing the result.
Mozilla has started to distribute two new system add-ons for Firefox 49.0 and Firefox 49.0.1 to address two issues affecting Adobe Flash Player and graphics issues.
The organization is working on Firefox 49.0.2 currently, but made the decision to release two new patches for the current stable version of Firefox as system add-ons to address issues that users are affected by.
System add-ons are like hotfixes. They can be pushed out to all Firefox users who have automatic updates enabled to fix issues of the browser. That's usually a lot faster than having to create a new build of Firefox.
The two system add-ons address two issues in Firefox 49 and 50.
Asynchronous Plugin Rendering and D3D9 Acceleration Fallback
Asynchronous Plugin Rendering enables asynchronoous plugin rendering in Firefox 49. The patch is designed to improve the performance of Adobe's Flash Player in Firefox, and to reduce the likelihood of crashes.
The patch flips the switch dom.ipc.plugins.asyncdrawing.enabled to true on Firefox 49 and Firefox 49.0.1. This fixes an issue that 64-bit users of Firefox experienced. Mozilla calls these issues "functional", and mentioned that it also caused issues with scrolling for e10s users and Flash content.
Mozilla will integrate the change in Firefox 49.0.2 which will be out soon. If you don't want to wait for the system add-on to be pushed to your copy of Firefox, flip the preference manually instead to resolve the issues:
Type about:config in the Firefox address bar. Confirm that you will be careful if the warning prompt spawns. Search for dom.ipc.plugins.asyncdrawing.enabled. If the preference's value is set to false, double-click it to set it to true instead. This enables asynchronous plugin rendering in Firefox.
The D3D9 Acceleration Fallback system add-on on the other hand deactivates Direct3D9 fallback if hardware acceleration is enabled in Firefox. This should fix graphics artifacts issues that some Firefox users are experiencing currently. The patch will land in Firefox 49 and Firefox 50.
Find out if the system add-ons are installed
You can find out if the system add-ons are already installed on your version of Firefox. Simply load about:support in the Firefox address bar and scroll down to the extensions group on the page.
There you find all user installed and Mozilla installed Firefox add-ons. If you find the two system add-ons mentioned above, then they are installed and enabled. If not, there is little that you can do but wait for them to become available on your system. (via Sören Hentzschel)

Courthouse raids by federal immigration officials over the past several months are spooking New Jersey's foreign-born population.
In a survey of nearly 60 New Jersey legal and social service providers who interact with immigrants regularly, the majority said their clients feared to enter the courts or asking for their help.
The accompanying report from a coalition of New Jersey-based immigrant advocacy groups points to "substantially increased immigration enforcement" since President Donald Trump took office at the start of 2017 — with a significant increase in the presence of Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents in and around state and municipal courts.
Arrests in Passaic, Dunellen and Freehold municipal courts, as well as in and around the Middlesex County courthouse, triggered the poll and survey.
"Almost 72 percent of the service providers who responded to the survey reported that they had clients who were afraid to interact with the courts because of ICE," said Lauren Herman, staff attorney with Make the Road New Jersey and an author of the report. "Fifty-six percent of the respondents said that they had clients who declined to attend municipal court because they were afraid of ICE."
The fear of getting handcuffed on site, and possibly detained and deported, may also be stopping individuals from requesting the court's assistance. Sixty-three percent of respondents cite clients who are afraid to file restraining orders. Fifty-five percent have clients who failed to file petitions or complaints.
"We think that conducting arrests in the courthouse is particularly problematic because of the broad-based chilling effect that it has, and it really interferes with the justice system," Herman said.
The chief justice of the state's highest court felt the same way in April. Supreme Court Chief Justice Stuart Rabner wrote to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, urging that such arrests not take place in courthouses.
DHS offered no official response, Herman noted.
So the coalition's report includes a list of recommendations for the state to implement itself in order to "protect the integrity of the justice system."
Those recommendations include adoption of a clear policy that would prohibit related civil arrests within a state or municipal courthouse, adoption of a clear policy that prohibits court employees from collecting information about the citizenship or immigration status of individuals within the courthouse, and developing a system to track data on ICE interactions in the courts and the impact of ICE's presence.

Pierre Omidyar's new media venture now has a name, $50M in funding and an interesting corporate structure
Not surprisingly — since it involves a billionaire spending $250 million on a brand new media venture with NSA leak architect Glenn Greenwald at the helm — there has been intense speculation about every aspect of eBay founder Pierre Omidyar's new entity since the news broke in October. On Thursday, the world got a small peek behind the curtain at some details about the venture.
The new entity is being called First Look Media, and it has received its first round of funding from Omidyar to the tune of $50 million, and is setting up offices in New York, Washington D.C. and San Francisco. The news came via a press release from Omidyar Group and a blog post from advisor Jay Rosen.
Advertisement
Two arms: One for profit and one non-profit
The new venture has an interesting structure, in that First Look Media will consist of two legal entities: one is a for-profit company whose goal will be to “develop new media technology,” and the other is a non-profit corporation that will pursue independent journalism. As Rosen describes it:
“The new company will consist of several legal entities. One is a technology company, a business run for profit, that will develop new media tools for First Look properties and other markets. Another is a 501(c)(3), a non-profit under U.S. law. Its mission will be to publish and support independent, public interest journalism. The 501(c)(3) will house the journalism operation, which hasn't given a name yet to its initial publication. It will have editorial independence. Profits earned by the technology company will be used to support the mission: independent public interest journalism.”
In some ways, this sounds a little like the corporate structure that supports The Guardian newspaper in Britain (please see disclosure below): parent company Guardian Media Group is a for-profit entity controlled by the Scott Trust, and it owns other assets such as the Auto Trader group of companies, whose profits help subsidize the Guardian‘s losses.
The first of several media offerings
Rosen also mentions Atavist, a publishing company that produces narrative non-fiction or long-form journalism, and is supported in part by the platform it created for that purpose, which is called Creativist.
“Another way to say it is: public service, mission-driven journalism, including investigative work, has always been subsidized by something: advertising, other kinds of news, donors to a non-profit (as with ProPublica) or a related and profitable business like the Bloomberg terminals that subsidize Bloomberg News. First Look Media is adding to the picture another possible source of support: profits from a company specifically focused on technology for producing, distributing and consuming news, views and information.”
Interestingly enough, both Omidyar's statement and Rosen's post refer to the media entity that Greenwald will presumably be working for as First Look Media's “initial digital publication,” implying that there will be others.
First Look has also been the subject of some controversy over allegations that Greenwald essentially sold the NSA leaks he received from Edward Snowden to Omidyar as part of the creation of the new-media venture. Greenwald has responded to those allegations in a lengthy post arguing that what he has done is no different from what other media entities do with similar stories.

Never mind the golden age of television. This is the age of the golden rule: Consumers have the gold and they make the rules.
From a consumer viewpoint, there were remarkable moments in the keynote address by Bell Media president Mary Ann Turcke at the Canadian Telecom Summit last week. Accusing Canadians who access U.S. Netflix as "stealing" was the one that got most of the attention, but she also observed that TV viewers "demand simplicity" and "will not tolerate national borders."
Story continues below advertisement
Exactly. Bell Media may "dread" Netflix Inc., but it's an icon of simplicity. It's been built, along with Google Inc., Amazon.com Inc., Facebook Inc. and Apple Inc. (a.k.a. GAFA), from the thin air of ideas. Combined, these innovators have just about completed a global techno-disruption of all media and many formerly non-media practices – in less than two decades.
While Ms. Turcke spoke in Toronto, I was addressing a Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission outreach panel in Ottawa, moderated by chairman and CEO Jean-Pierre Blais, at the Canadian Communications Association conference.
The reason for the panel was a search for fresh perspectives on Canadian TV in the era of online global delivery, which everyone knows is reality (or so I thought). The CRTC is so serious about the need for innovative ideas that it's established a Prize for Excellence in Policy Research, an initiative that reconfirms my sense, held over from Let's Talk TV, that our regulator seems ahead of the industry.
This year, 2015, appears to be the tipping point when TV, the original electronic screen medium, is finally sucked online. Half the customers for HBO-GO (not available in Canada) are predicted to cut their cable. On average, 25 per cent of the MBA students I ask have cable. Wasn't it just more like 90 per cent?
In the 20th century, the music business learned that trying to fight consumer preference was a futile strategy. Attention quickly turned to innovative business models for the distribution of digital content, such as iTunes.
Newspapers' slog to digital distribution is yet unfolding. Paywalls were an epic fail. I'm thrilled to see The New York Times partnering with Facebook, a free Times app on my Twitter feed and an article co-published by the Times and the Huffington Post, a digital native "paper."
The global reorganization of the TV business, however, lags behind. Here's a lesson for Ms. Turcke from print media: Good luck goading customers toward revenue streams from outdated distribution models. I wonder if fear might explain her remark about "stealing" Netflix? Watching its U.S. version (which MBA students freely admit to) seems like a business-to-business game, in which TV consumers have no skin.

One of my Ottawa co-panelists, Nina Duque, is about to publish a study suggesting that young Canadians don't even really know what broadcast channels are. They watch TV online.
The assumption that viewers are already online also seemed implicit in keynotes from the Telecom Summit. Nitin Kawale, president of Rogers Communications Inc.'s business enterprises, pointed out that Canadian consumers live in the digital era, but Canadian industry – not so much. He cited Canada's poor rating in innovation, 13 of 16 peer countries.
Mark Henderson, president of Ericsson Canada Inc., described how 5G, the next generation of mobile data, will operationalize machine-to-machine communication and the Internet of Things. Ms. Turcke, who has engineering, science and business degrees, knows all this.
Yet Canada's online TV offerings, Shomi (Rogers and Shaw Communications Inc.) and Crave (Bell), are puzzling. What's the customer-value proposition? While Shomi has announced that a standalone app is coming, neither is proposed as global. Are they Netflix competitors?
What about global rights to Canadian content and 5 per cent of world markets – shouldn't this be an area where Canadian companies innovate? What's the point of an online venture, if not to go global? Making and exploiting winning content may be the only TV business model left.
In Ottawa, I suggested that we must think innovatively, and do so urgently. Our system has been well built for national profits on global content.

This might be backward for the new TV era. Perhaps we should think global profits on national content.
To follow the golden rule, namely the money, perhaps it makes sense to reflect on, rather than hate on, the TV choices of your teenage consumer.
A bigoted booth at a family fun fair in Bartlett, TN angered many in the community this week. According to WMC-TV Channel 5 in Bartlett, townspeople contacted the TV station saying the messages on the booth were offensive and highly inappropriate.
The group Acts! Memphis sponsored the booth, which displayed images of the burning World Trade Center towers next to a photo of President Barack Obama's face. ACT! Memphis bills itself as a non-partisan group seeking to raise awareness about the dangers of Islamic extremism.
Channel 5 attempted to interview the leader of the group at the Bartlett Festival, but he refused to go on camera in a format that could be edited by producers. No one in the ACT! for America organization does anything other than live interviews, he said.
ACT! Memphis responded to WCM's story about the offensive booth on its website in a 10-paragraph rant directed at “a woman” who “was offended when ACT! Memphis staffed a booth at the Bartlett Festival.”
“Was she offended,” the site asked, “when a HAMAS Intelligence [sic] officer was found living in Collierville and deported?”
In a tone of escalating outrage, ACT! Memphis demanded to know if the person complaining about the political and social propriety of linking Pres. Obama to the World Trade Center attacks on Sep. 11, 2001 was offended when supposed jihadis and anti-Western terrorists were allegedly found to be lurking in the back woods of Tennessee.
The City of Bartlett confirmed that ACT! Memphis operated a booth at the Bartlett Festival, but declined to comment on the appropriateness of its message.

× Former IU assistant director for student conduct sentenced for possession of child pornography

BLOOMINGTON, Ind. (May 13, 2015)-- An Indiana University staff member was arrested Tuesday on a charge of possession of child pornography.
Jon T. Riveire, 32, of Bloomington is an Assistant Director for Student Conduct in the Office of Student Ethics at Indiana University.
A detective with the Bloomington Police Department received a tip through the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC) that an image that may be considered child pornography had been uploaded to a Gmail account.
NCMEC provided Bloomington police with the IP address of the computer used and it came back to Indiana University.
Police then obtained a court order to determine the actual location and the person associated with the IP address on campus.
The results of that indicated that the IP address and the laptop computer owned by the university was associated with Riveire at his IU office at 801 North Jordan.
On Tuesday, Riveire was taken into custody and transported to the Bloomington Police Department for an interview. Riveire requested a lawyer and did not speak further. He was then booked into the Monroe County Jail.
Additional electronic devices seized as part of a search warrant are currently being searched for evidence. So far, approximately 30 additional images of child pornography have been discovered on the laptop computer.
The case remains under investigation.
"That just sets a really bad example and it's just really shocking honestly," said Ben Kurtz, an IU student.
Other students reacted to the news as it spread around campus.
"It's just unfortunate that someone in a position of authority just completely goes against everything that they're supposed to be regulating," said Mike McMahan.
On Wednesday, Indiana University spokesman Mark Land released this statement:
Zombie squadrons ‘Evil Dead' team recount how they got on at this year's UKTC:
The UKTC is a national competition held in Milton Keynes at the Jurys Inn hotel. Teams of 3 compete for bragging rights and swag. Each team must have one list from each faction and at the start of the Match you take turns in picking your pairings which creates some serious schnenanigans as people try to avoid bad match ups.
This year's were on the 9th of October and held at the Jurys Inn hotel.
We'd sat down before the tournament and decided that we'd run with Sam Raimi's undead classics (not strictly zombie's..) as our team names… hence Evil Dead 1,2 and Army of Darkness.
With Captain JacksButt – Evil Dead 2 taking a more ‘clipboard' scientific approach to match ups, out team Captain Tom opted for a ‘read about it the night before' approach. Luckily this gelled well with our general pre-game tactic which was to stand around the opposition lists pointing at things whilst saying helpful comments like “I want that one” and “I don't like it”…
Our lists:
Each match is in the players own words….
MATCH 1 vs Eagle Blue Squadron
Simon vs Sam flying Scum: Fenn Rau, Ketsu, Z95 with feedback
I spread out with Zuckuss in the middle and Sam put his Z95 in the middle with Fenn and Ketsu at the top right of the board. I ended up blowing 2 sets of Torps on the Z95 to stop it blocking me and then played kill the Ketsu… Things did not go well and Sam deleted Zuckuss early before capitalising on some poor positioning by me. Just to cheer me up Fenn flew in an punched me on the nose repeatedly. Next time Kill the Ketsu is the priority. LOSS 60ish-100
Chris vs Peter flying Rebels: Kanan ghost tlt/ Rourke hawk/ Zeb shuttle docked.
Very interesting build with lando and experimental interface with advanced sensors.
So at first positioning was good and sacrificed some health for two tokened shots on the ghost. Despite target locks someone had obviously thrown banana skins in my gun barrels. Scoring two hits on the ghost between both of mine. I pursued the ghost but with double focus from Kyle crew and lando I was getting next to no damage after Kanan pilot ability reduced my dice pool. To Peters credit he flew much better than I did and deserved the win…LOSS
Tom vs- Simrandeep flying imperials: Triple Defenders
In the run up to Nationals I had a lot of practise against defender lists. The combination of free damage and blocks from Oicuun and 5 dice Whisper shots can punch through fully tokened x7 defenders. Pretty much what happened. WIN
TEAM RESULT: Loss 1-2
MATCH 2 vs Hits Quits
Simon vs Will Smith flying Rebels: 3x Warden squadron pilots with bombs and Sabine.
Will got pushed under the bus by his team as no one wanted to go up against the jumpmasters. That said I thought he flew his pants off and did his best to give me a really hard time. I flew in from the bottom right of the board edge aiming between a diagonal running asteroid field. Sabine and Prox mines caused a surprising amount of damage before I focused her down and I ended up with both Jumpmasters going below half points before I finally managed to kill off the final K wing. WIN
Chris vs Apologies the name escapes me- nice chap: Flying scum Kath and Ketsu.
This was a great back and forth game of legging it with my two ghosts and using 5k turns to mess him up. My ps4 headhunter got a great lock on with missiles for Kath and after moving was still in arc with a shot. Sadly Ketsu had other plans and tractors my tala out of arc. Sneaky git. Despite the set back I just pounded on Kath and ignored the other ship until late game and I hid behind my wall of hull. WIN.
Tom vs Rob from Could City radio flying Imperials: Palp shuttle and defenders.
This game was decided on the first shot. A slight mistake with Whisper landed her in arc of both defenders. She missed the shuttle with 5 dice and did not get her free focus token and went down quickly. Oicuun managed to out fly the defenders for a few turns and finish off the shuttle though! LOSS
TEAM RESULT: WIN 2-1
MATCH 3 vs Yoda Cola Co
Simon vs Andrew flying Rebels: Ghost and R2D2 Corran Horran.
We set up on my left hand side of the board and clashed about half way and after an initial salvo with the Torps against the Ghost I should have switched to Primary weapons and used Zuckuss to burn it down. I made a series of poor choices and split my firing between the ghost and the E-Wing which meant that the Ghost was alive for an extra 2 turns and Corran Was able to slip out of the noose…. I made a huge mis-calculation and thinking that I still had 2 hulls left on Zuckuss risked a 3 bank to get a potential kill shot on Corran even though it meant flying over an asteroid to do it… after all it would have to be a Crit and double damage right? Wrong. I only had 1 hull left and promptly ran head first into the rock blowing myself up. Corran then repeatedly managed to go from no shield to full shields and Corran cleaned up by double tapping me into oblivion. I hate that Corran. LOSS
Chris vs Nick flying Scum: Dengar and Ventress
I made a big mistake right at the start. I deployed on the right of the table and I went after ventress first. I deserved the pounding I got for my folly. Well played Nick. LOSS
Tom vs Flying Imperials: Inquisitor, Omega, Vessary
I had a pretty big stoke of luck this game. Inquisitor barely landed on a rock and was defenceless against Whisper's 5 dice attack. 5 hits and only a single evade resulted in one dead TIE Adv Prototype before it had fired a single shot. Omega leader was also quickly swept up but Vessary proved very troublesome with his Ion cannon! WIN
TEAM RESULT: LOSS 1-2
MATCH 4 vs All Oughta Bubblegum
Simon vs Tom flying Rebels: Kannan Ghost VCX with docked Pantom and a Zeb Shuttle.
Asteroid placement created two channels vertically. Contrary to film legend I placed Bobba Scout in the corner (Footloose) on my right and the Plasma scout just right of centre. With the Ghost and Zeb lining up Opposite Bobba I placed Zuckuss on my right in order to joust. Looks like it was going to be a straight forward mudslinging match.
Having slow rolled Bobba and Zuckuss I pushed the Plasma scout on a 4 forward to clear the offside rocks and then hard turned him right to shoot the ghost on the flank. After the initial salvo I'd stripped the ghosts shields and then used Bobba to remove the Ghost title rendering the Phantom useless until the ghost exploded and thus keeping a limping Zuckuss on his remaining 2 hull. Everything then K-Turned and The Ghost got blasted allowing Zeb to pop out before also getting destroyed having stripped several shields from Bobbas boat.
Quick mention here that Tom spotted just before we'd begun the game that I'd not placed my Zuckuss Dial and reminded me- He could just have easily let the game start and flown me off the board- fast forward to late game and Sabines Shuttle tried to boost and then do a 3 bank which put it off board- Because Karma is a thing, Tom got to change his dial to the hard 2 and then proceeded to hammer Zuckuss off the board. Having started to sweat slightly that the shuttle might solo me his green dice blanked out and that was game. WIN
Tom vs James flying Scum: Tel Terva, Bossk
This was an interesting game. Tel was equipped with determination and discarded a total of 3 crits! Combined with his pilot ability and hull upgrade, he tanked an extra 6 damage before going down! Bossk and Tel's revenge droid made short work of Whisper. However, Bossk had to take about 5 stress making Whisper reroll evades to get her. Oicuun managed to blitz his way behind him and finish him off. WIN
TEAM RESULT: WIN 2-1
Nearly there….
MATCH 5 vs Zombie Squadron Army of Darkness
A Zombie Squadron grudge match against our AoD team!
Simon vs Frank Hanford flying Imperials: Vassery / Vader/ Omega leader.
I Set up with Bobba scout on the right and the Plasma Scout in the middle of the board, Zuckuss went next to the plasma. lined up against Omega leader but then swung in and kill boxed the Defender, next took down Omega leader and then played chase down Vader who was chasing my heavily wounded Bobba scout in the top left edge of the board. Vader repeated rolled blank green dice and went down in flames. WIN
Chris vs Jon Corps flying Rebels: Jan Ors hawk/ Miranda/ Braylen stram.
Always a pleasure. Having flown a similar list myself I know how it works but John flew it far better than I did. There was much hunting of Miranda and Jan while he picked off my lothal with Hera crew. It was a very tight game and despite the round being in the bag for us we threw everything we had into it. I was left with a half health lothal and a headhunter on 1 health and John with just the ARC left. 8 or 9 points in it. WIN
Tom vs Ollie Wr flying Scum: Fenn Rau, Old Teroch, Manaroo
Ollie wanted to pair off against Simon but we went for the win… Ollie's ships are super sexy but that did not stop me from blowing them up with some ridiculous dice rolls.
TEAM RESULT- WIN 3-0 (in your face AOD)
Followed by a trip to the bar by both teams for a well earned beer.
MATCH 6 vs Avenger Squadrons
Avenger Squadron do reviews on upgrade cards (click on the above link to check them out) and luckily for us are really nice chaps and a great team to play against going into the last round…
Chris vs Martyn Chivers flying Imperials: 3 academies/3 blacks cracks/ howlrunner with crack.
I had felt some of my match ups were sacrificial and despite my lack of skill with this list I hadn't done too badly. In this match Crack shot does little to me with ghosts but the swarm are a big ships nightmare.
So last round all or nothing. Well I got the second part down. We all know the standard swarm deployment and making sure they push all the rocks away to the corners.
Anyway I knew this was a loss for me going in but Martyn was a gent and we had a laugh. I lasted around 13 rounds before finally dying but managed to take out 3 ties for my trouble and nearly popped one or two others. LOSS
Tom vs Guy flying Scum: Ventress, Fenn Rau, Feedback Pirate
I was worried about lists like this in the build up to the event. Ventress can stop my cloaks and Fenn kills whoever he likes. A clutch block with Oicunn meant I could safely deal with Fenn and the Pirate before Ventress could get into position. With Oicuun close to death it was all the play for. However sneaking a damaged engine crit on to Ventress was crippling. WIN
Simon vs Chris flying Rebels: Poe R5P9/Hawk focus Farm/ Jake Farrel PTL A-Wing.
It doesn't get any closer than this! Ours was the last game to finish, and with the team scores tied it went right down to the last roll of the game….
Tiredness was defeating my ropey non-brand energy drink addled brain and I made a huge mistake in my set up. Splitting Zuckuss off from the Jumpmasters and running him at a Flanking Farrel leaving The Scouts to waste a volley of fire on Poe before overshooting to eventually kill off a very tanky Hawk. I then got lured into shooting the A-Wing for several turns with both scouts and realised almost too late that I needed more ships to kill Poe off. A fast reposition of at the 11th hour and Time was called as I rolled the final range 1 shot…. and with the dice gods smiling- vaporised Poe. WIN
TEAM RESULT: WIN 2-1
FINAL Team RESULT 4-2
Final team Position: 10th
Plus as the highest ranked Zombie Squadron Team we came away with the our own internal trophy:
Conclusion
10th out of 51… not too shabby for our first outing. I really enjoyed working as a team and have to give credit to Chris as he definitely had to bite the bullet on more than one occasion so that me and Tom could push for the win. I personally made life hard for myself in some of my games by over thinking things and not focus firing.
Overall a throughly enjoyable day out and we'll definitely be back for more next year. Good job Guardians of Tyr.

Fraternity and sorority members are significantly more engaged in their workplace and overall happier than students who were not part of a Greek organization, according to a new survey from Gallup.
The survey — which covered both workplace engagement and overall well-being — found several benefits of collegiate Greek membership. According to Gallup Education Director Brandon H. Busteed, "the overall results suggest that the Greek experience could be beneficial for the vast majority of those involved in it."
Here's why Greeks are better at their jobs, via Gallup:
Fraternity and sorority members' engagement advantage indicates that they are more likely to be intellectually and emotionally connected to their organizations and enthusiastic about their work. Overall, 43% of fraternity and sorority members who are employed full time for an employer are engaged in the workplace, compared with 38% of all other college graduates. Importantly, these differences are statistically significant after controlling for key demographic variables, including gender, race, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status.
The survey also found that fraternity and sorority members are more likely to be thriving in all of Gallup's five elements of well-being — purpose, social, financial, community, and physical. According to Gallup:
Fraternity and sorority members are more likely than their non-Greek counterparts to find fulfillment in daily work and interactions, to have strong social relationships and access to the resources people need, to feel financially secure, to be physically healthy, and to take part in a true community.
Here's a more detailed breakdown of how fraternities and sororities give students a better well-being, via Gallup:

These findings are part of the inaugural Gallup-Purdue index, a new survey of more than 30,000 U.S. college graduates "designed to determine what happens during college that leads to happy, successful lives," according to The Wall Street Journal.

Last night, I found myself lying in bed until the early hours of the morning watching old Jake & Amir videos. Don't get me wrong, this isn't a rare occurrence for me! Watching old J&A videos is one of my favorite things to do, but this time it seemed somehow different. It seemed like I was reliving my childhood, tracking back through my teenage years, and remembering how I became the person I am today.
It's safe to say that Collegehumor and Jake & Amir played a huge part in my adolescence . I remember pretending I was ill and skiving off school when I was 14 so I could watch the Nighter livestream, and running up my parents phone bill trying to ring Gale Beggy! It was what me and my friends talked about after class and it was a constant source of enjoyment between the ages of 14 and 20. It was something that most people didn't know existed, but for me it was the funniest thing I'd ever seen, comparable to any of the shows I watched on TV. Last year, my girlfriend and I got the opportunity to see Jake & Amir perform live in Manchester. It was the most excited I've ever been, I never thought for one moment that I'd have the opportunity to see these people who I'd been laughing with for years in person. The world of Collegehumor and J&A seemed so far away, alien and American. How could it be here? It was the best live show I've ever been to.
Yesterday, I discovered that Jake & Amir would be ending.
I can only compare what I feel now to how I felt when I watched the last episode of The Office. I'd grown up with those characters and as the final credits rolled, I felt that I was saying goodbye to my friends for the final time. I felt that my childhood was over now that The Office wasn't a part of it. This is exactly how I feel now. I feel that a chapter of my youth is closing, and a highlight of my week is leaving.
I don't want this to seem negative. Jake & Amir should be immensely proud of what they've achieved, and I'm glad they'll be leaving on a high, unlike some other comedians who have simply faded into obscurity. I'm certain that this is not the end for the duo. There's a TBS show in the works (it better come to the UK!) and I'm assuming that the podcast will keep going. I'm sure that I will return to the Jake & Amir webseries whenever I need a pick-me-up and I will have many more late nights of “just one more video”. I hope that the show is ending so they can both go on to do huge things like I know they capable of. But there will be a void in my days all the same, and I will look back at this tiny part of the internet with great fondness.
Thank you Jake Hurwitz and Amir Blumenfeld, have an amazing future! From one fan, on behalf of thousands!
Yes, you have a female brain. Don't really mean much, do it?
You aren't hard-coded to act “feminine.”
You aren't naturally inclined to like the color pink.
You aren't programmed to want to wear skirts or high heels or anything like that.
Your female brain doesn't mean chocolate IS YOUR FAVORITE FOOD OMG.
Your female brain doesn't mean anything.
Except for one, very important thing.
It means you identify with other females.
You should be like them. You must be like them.
You know, a lot of other females like pink… hm… Is it your imagination, or are you tempted to like it, too?
And what's this about wearing women's clothing? All the other girls are doing it!? Every single one? Little weird if you're the odd-one-out, huh?
Chocolate? Bah. Mango is better.
The only thing that's hard-coded is the human need to fit in with your group.
Everyone else does it.
Everyone else has to.
What makes you so different?
Oh, you're a trans woman? Huh.
Guess it applies to you, too.
There's nothing like flashlight beams cutting through trees near Vancouver to evoke the X-Files. The writers dig deep to explain some unusual appearances. And Swan Queen gets a cliffhanger.
Michael's “Always… no, no… never… forget to check your references.”
“Heart of Gold” (1972)
Neil Young's only #1 in the United States.
I want to live,
I want to give
I've been a miner for a heart of gold.
Keep me searching for a heart of gold.
You keep me searching and I'm growing old.
Rumpelstiltskin's heart is failing without is magic to keep him alive. His past misdeeds have shriveled it to a blackened lump. He's growing old. He wants to live.
There's also the enduring literary trope of the prostitute or courtesan with a hidden integrity or kindness, the hooker with a heart of gold. Once Upon a Time will occasionally invert a trope to devastating effect. At the end of last season, Hook and Charming had a conversation about love that would have been at home in any chick flick. Uttered between two men, it might have been one of the most revolutionary scenes on network television. Here, Robin is unwilling to take certain actions within the remit of his talents and profession because of his own peculiar integrity, making him a representative of the trope.
‘Cor Aut Mors'
Latin: literally “Heart or Death”
It's a bit odd for a container holding a heart-healing potion, but when you consider it's symbolic meaning it's a very writerly addition. It represents a choice between the heart, moral values and integrity, and death, ignominy and disrespect. Robin chooses to help will at his own risk and extends that choice throughout his life.
Midnight Cowboy
As we transition to New York, nine weeks ago, we fade in on a skyline and hear the quotable, “I'm walkin' here.”
Enchanted
Robin riding a horse down a New York street is reminiscent of Prince Edward's anacronistic behavior in the city.
The Wizard of Oz
Any episode with the Wicked Witch and the Emerald City is, of course, going to reference this. But there are a couple immediate specific references that deserve mention. Robin exits the magical doorway on the yellow brick road.
In addition, the door lands right on top of a guard whose boots stick out in front. And Robin steals them!
The Patchwork Girl of Oz
The seventh book in L. Frank Baum's Oz series. Unc Nunkie and Margolotte Pipt are turned to marble by the Liquid of Petrifaction. Dr. Pipt sends Ojo on a mission to collect the ingredients needed to restore them to life. One of those ingredients is the rare six-leaved clover of Oz, which grows outside the Emerald City. Queen Ozma has outlawed the picking of the clover and its use in magical transformations in conjuction with her injunction against sorcery.
However you feel about the twist, its been Oz cannon for over a century. Honestly, I probably missed half a dozen book references.
The Walt Disney Company
One of the first references in The Wizard of Oak is a set of Mickey Mouse ears cast in steel.
Aladdin
Robin's hanging out in front of a poster for Disney's Aladdin on Broadway while he waits for Gold's discharge.
Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?
After giving Regina an opportunity to call Robin, and asking her to choose between him and Emma, Rumple takes the phone from her and asks the tense iconic, “Is that your final answer?”
Once Upon a Time
2×19 “Lacey”
This episode explains both why Robin Hood looked different, other than because he was originally played by Tom Ellis, in “Lacey” and where he got the bow that never misses.
3×21 “Snow Drifts”
Gold “kills” Zelena. Wile they come back to the events and even reuse footage, there's a bit where Robin's lurking outside The Wizard of Oak and says, “Zelena's no fool.” Gold replies, “No, she wasn't.”
Erin's Happy Shipper Moments
Captain Swan
Nothing for us here this week, dearies. Except for the flashback to the Captain Swan shippiest episode ever “Snow Drifts” wherein we get to see them dancing around the ballroom again.
Rumpbelle
There are a number of scenes showing us Rumple in regret mode: First of which, his heart is diseased from dark magic. Now that's certainly less cheesy than dying from a broken heart, but it rings similarly in this situation. The loss of Belle's love has put him in this position. However, it seems like this might have been good information to tell Belle when she was getting him to give up magic: “My dear, I'd love to give up magic for you, but I'll literally die.”
He tells Robin he didn't recognize happiness when he had it–what he had in front of him wasn't enough. Although he's ambiguous about the when he had happiness, I can only assume he means Belle.
But the best of these moments is definitely when he advises Robin: “If you know who and where your happy ending is, you should run to it and not let go.” Sadly, Robin focuses on the previous bit about what is in front of him and not the idea of running off to Regina. But that's another ship.
Swan Queen
When Rumple proves that Zelena has Robin in her clutches and threatens to kill him if Regina doesn't help Rumple push Emma to the dark side, Regina chooses Emma. She chooses Emma! “You made me a monster. I won't let you do the same to Emma.” “So you've made your choice, have you? You're choosing the Savior over your beloved Robin Hood?” No, Rumple, she's choosing her beloved Savior over Robin Hood.
Outlaw Queen
We got a replay of the goodbye kiss between Robin and Regina from when Robin, Marian, and Roland left Storybrooke.
Gold attempts to use the love between Regina and Robin to manipulate Regina. It doesn't exactly work, but my theory on why is that Regina respects and loves Robin in part for his honorable code. He makes her a better person because she sees that code as a model to better herself, become a hero.
Many Outlaw Queen fans have wanted Marian out of the way since she made her way to Storybrooke, but the way this episode gets rid of her but doesn't blow chunks. When Marian was the real Marian, she was also a real choice for Robin to make. There was real character turmoil, both for him and the audience. Honor would say stay with your wife and mother of your son. But then there's true love. Now that Marian is simply Zelena, all that character turmoil disappears, at least for the audience. Now the whole this is a no-brainer running off of dramatic irony only AND they killed off an otherwise pretty awesome woman in Marian. I tell you, writers, we Outlaw Queen fans didn't need it made easy for us. We knew true love would prevail. We knew Marian's honor and desire for Robin's happiness would eventually send him back to Storybrooke.
Robin/Marian
I don't know if anyone out there was actually rooting for these two. But the episode seemed to set up exactly why you should ship them and then rip the ship right out from under us.
First, there's Robin's gallant retrieval of Marian's purse via horseback. (The first two clues of the episode that Marian was Zelena: 1) that a thief's wife would set down her purse in a busy city, and 2) that a mother would need to set down her bag to pick up her 4-year old.) But the purse's rescue was pretty darned awesome.
Second, the flashbacks to Sherwood Forest include married Marian and Robin exchanging loving looks at each other as she waits tables and he barkeeps. We get just a brief look at the jealousy of the Sheriff of Nottingham. It's all pretty cute.
Third, when Robin joins the Merry Men as an outlaw and dubs himself Robin Hood, Marian is amazingly supportive. “It doesn't matter where we are or what we face. I want to be with you.”
So when all of that gets turned upside down by the reveal that Marian is actually Zelena and has been since before Hook and Emma returned from the Enchanted Forest, anyone who started rooting for these two is heavily disappointed. And the impact of Robin's decision to try to be the husband Marian deserves is completely undercut.

One of our editors asked Twitter what some of their favorite things are for Twitchy to cover, and it was no surprise when many answered with stories about the Sean Spicer parody account, @sean_spicier.
Which made us so happy because we LOVE writing about the parody account who is winning hearts and confusing the shiznit out of and enraging the Left.

Ted Cruz took the stage at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland on Wednesday night and encouraged Republican voters not to stay home in November. The crowd cheered, thinking he was telling them to vote for his bitter rival, Donald Trump.
But Cruz stopped short of that, instead saying, “Stand and speak and vote your conscience, vote for candidates up and down the ticket who you trust to defend our freedom and be faithful to the Constitution.”
This illicted boos and calls of, “We want Trump!”

Foundation Design
Foundation is the base of any structure. Without a solid foundation, the structure would not hold for long. We have to be very cautious with the design of foundations because our entire structure rests on the foundation. The job of a foundation is to transfer the loads of the building safely to the ground.
The strength of the foundation determines the life of the structure. As we discussed in the earlier article, design of foundation depends on the type of soil, type of structure and its load. Higher the load bearing capacity of the soil, the larger the load it could safely carry.
Foundations are basically divided into Shallow Foundations and Deep Foundations.
In this article, we are going discuss the step-by-step guide to Column Footing Design for a shallow foundation.
Reinforced Concrete Footings
Footing comprises of the lower end of a column, pillar or wall which i enlarged with projecting courses so as to distribute load.
Footings shall be designed to sustain the applied loads, moments and forces and the induced reactions and to ensure that any settlement which may occur shall be as uniform as possible and the safe bearing capacity of soil is not exceeded.
In sloped or stepped footings, the effective cross-section in compression shall be limited by the area above the neutral plane, and the angle of slope or depth and location of steps should be such that the design requirements are satisfied at every section.
Design Procedure of Column Footings | Foundation Design
Here is a step-by-step guide to Column Footing Design:
Step 1
Area required for footing
Square = B = (w+w1)/P0
Where, Po = safe bearing capacity of soil
w1 = self weight of footing
w = self weight of footing
For Rectangle = b/d = B/D
A = b x d
Net upward pressure on the footing
q/p = W/A
Step 2
Bending Moment
Critical section for maximum bending moment is taken at the face of the column
For a square footing,
M xx = q x B/8 (L – a)2
M xx = q x L/8 (B – b)2
M yy = q x B/8 (L – a)2
Step 3
To fix the depth of the footing shall be greater of the following:
Depth from bending moment consideration
d = √(M/Qb)
where, Q = moment of required factor
Depth from shear consideration
Check for one way shear
Check for two way shear or punching shear
Critical shear for one way shear is considered at a distance ‘d' from face of the column.
Shear force, V = qB [ ½(B – b) d]
Nominal shear stress, T v = k . T c
Tc = 0.16√fck
Step 4
Check for two way shear
Critical section for two way shear is considered at a distance at a distance d/2 from all the faces of the column.
SF, V = q [ B2 – (b + d)2]
SF, V = q [L x B – (a + d)(b + d)]
Nominal shear stress, T v = V/2((a+d)(b+d)d) ——- {for a rectangle
Tv = V/4((b+d)d) ——- {for a square
Tv = k . T c
k = 0.5 + β > 1 ; [Beta β = ratio of sides of the column
Tc = 0.16√fck
Area of steel, Ast = M/((σ)stjd)

Manure, Fertilizer Part Of Chesapeake's Problem
First in a two-part series
After two decades of raising chickens at her farm on Maryland's eastern shore, Carole Morison quit last year, in part because she was tired of polluting the Chesapeake Bay.
"I'll be the first one to say that I'm part of the problem," Morison says. "My only wish is that other people would own up and quit the denial and finger-pointing and say, 'We have a problem. Let's fix it.' "
More than 25 years ago, the federal government and several states pledged to restore the Chesapeake Bay. But the nation's largest estuary is still so polluted that every summer, a stretch dozens of miles long is starved of oxygen to the extent that conditions are not suitable for fish and many other animals.
Enlarge this image toggle caption Katia Riddle/NPR Katia Riddle/NPR
Oyster and crab populations are at fractions of their historic levels. President Obama says it is time for a new strategy to heal the bay.
One reason the cleanup has failed is that the bay's watershed is huge: Pollution from six states and Washington, D.C., drains into it. When it rains, manure and chemical fertilizers run off dairies in rural New York and Pennsylvania, turkey farms in Virginia's Shenandoah Valley, and chicken operations in Delaware and Maryland.
Farmers have made changes to reduce their pollution, but agriculture still is responsible for a lot of the pollution that starves the bay of oxygen. Nitrogen and phosphorus are the two main culprits, and agriculture contributes 38 percent of the nitrogen and 45 percent of the phosphorus, according to the federal government.
Chicken Farms Pollute By Air And By Water
Two huge chicken houses still eclipse Morison's modern yellow farmhouse. She cracks the door of one of them to show how some of that nitrogen gets into the bay.

"I am warning you," she said. "This is a really strong odor of ammonia, and this is after a year of no chickens being in these houses."
The stench is so strong, it's hard to breathe.
Chicken operations in this area use big fans to blow the ammonia out of the houses. When it rains, the rain brings the ammonia down to the ground as nitrogen. Ammonia air pollution from livestock operations across the bay's huge watershed is responsible for about 6 percent of the nitrogen in the bay, according to the Environmental Protection Agency.
But Morison says chicken operations like hers on the Delmarva Peninsula pollute in a more direct way.
The Delmarva Peninsula is the low-lying stretch of land shared by Delaware, Maryland and Virginia that divides the bay from the Atlantic Ocean. The industry estimates that 2,000 farms raise chickens there. Because the land is so flat and soggy, ditches run everywhere.
There's one about 30 feet from the huge shed where Morison stored the manure from the hundreds of thousands of chickens she raised each year.
The shed is the size of a pro-basketball court. Deep ruts and potholes are leftover from the heavy machinery that was used to carry away the manure.
Morison points to one full of sepia-colored water, which she says is a telltale sign of manure.
"I call it manure tea," she says.
Chesapeake Bay Health In 2008 Dissolved oxygen is vital to marine life, but this map shows that the Chesapeake Bay's supply is depleted during the summer months. In what is known as the "dead zone" — where the red streak is on the map — fishermen's nets are coming back empty because there isn't enough oxygen in the water to sustain them.
She often saw that "manure tea" in the ditches that drain her property. They empty into a small creek behind it, which flows into the Pocomoke River, a tributary of the Chesapeake Bay.
Morison says pollution is "inevitable" from operations like hers.
"It's no wonder we're failing miserably at cleaning up the bay," she adds.
Dead Zone Beneath The Surface
Across the Chesapeake from Morison's farm, University of Maryland professor Thomas Miller studies the bay from the university's Chesapeake Biological Laboratory on Solomons Island.
The scene of the Patuxent River flowing into the bay is gorgeous from the pier outside his office. But Miller says the beauty of the bay above the water's surface gives people a faulty impression. To judge the bay's health, you have to look under the surface.
"Until quite recently, there would have been large seagrass meadows and large oyster reefs in front of this area," says Miller. "And now if you were to look out there from one of our research vessels, you'd find those almost completely gone. Even though the view on the surface looks unchanged, the view underneath the water would be very different," Miller says.
Miller gets a glimpse of what's going on below the bay's surface when he tows a huge net behind a ship to survey fish.
In most regions of the Chesapeake Bay, the nets pull up thousands of fish, but not in the long thin stretch of the bay that has very low oxygen during the summer.
"You can pull a net through that water and come up absolutely empty. And it is really quite startling to bring a net on board with no fish at all," Miller says.
It is known as the dead zone. Animals and fish simply cannot survive in that water, and have to leave.
Miller blames overfishing for nearly wiping out oysters. But he fingers nitrogen and phosphorus for his empty nets. It's not just local farms that cause the trouble. Much of that pollution comes from manure and chemical fertilizers used on farms far from the bay.
Huge Watershed Complicates Cleanup

The pollution even comes from dairies 400 miles northwest of the bay, in the headwaters of the Susquehanna River, the bay's biggest tributary.
One of the reasons it has been so hard to clean up the bay is that pollution from six states and Washington, D.C., drains into it. Many of the people who live in the watershed rarely think of their connection to the bay.
Bob Aman runs a big dairy in the rolling hills of Candor, N.Y. The creek that flows through his pasture dumps into the Susquehanna River.
"Everything that flows from here ends up in the bay, if it flows that far," he says, as he stands next to the picturesque stream.
Aman keeps 500 milk cows in one huge barn, and each day they produce 15,000 gallons of manure.
He uses a contraption called a digester to turn much of the manure into gas, which he uses to generate electricity.
He spends a lot of time and money trying to keep manure out of his stream. But many of his neighbors still spread manure on fields — even when they're covered with snow and can't absorb the nitrogen and phosphorus.
Aman says at least farmers know they're part of the problem, and they do what they can afford to do to avoid polluting.
"We as farmers are getting a little tired of everybody pointing their finger at us. I think we're a little bit of a scapegoat. There's as much pollution coming from lawns and detergents," he says.
In fact, cities, towns and industrial areas together do pump more nitrogen and phosphorus into the bay than agriculture. The Obama administration has put states on notice: Unless they slash pollution to the bay from all sources, the federal government will have to step in.

1. Over the course of the campaign, you have proposed a significantly higher corporate tax rate when U.S. corporations are currently taxed at the highest rate in the world. Many economists believe that the high corporate tax rate forces businesses to keep their profits overseas and contributes to the offshoring of factories and other job-producing private-sector ventures.
Please explain how taxing businesses even more will encourage them to create jobs in America?
2. Many of the relatives of those who were left behind to die in Benghazi while your State Department sat on requests to enter Libyan airspace to launch a rescue have stated that you lied to them about that attack.
Would you like to use this time to apologize to them for claiming that a video caused the attack, when your own emails to your daughter show that you knew it was al Qaida behind it all along?
3. Speaking of emails, it has just come out that President Obama utilized a pseudonym in corresponding with you through your private, unauthorized email server.
When did he start communicating with you using a false name, and wasn't this necessitated by an administration with wide recognition that any emails sent to you were not secure?
4. You are on the record doubling down on the war on coal, and extending that to increased regulation of hydraulic fracturing.
What would you say to those voters, particularly in Ohio and Pennsylvania, who have seen the economic devastation of the war on coal and now fear that under a Hillary Clinton presidency, the hopes of economic revival spawned by the shale oil/natural gas revolution will be crushed by a new set of environmental regulations?
5. When you became secretary of State, you famously called for a Russian "reset" for better relations between the United States and Russia. Yet, the world has become a dramatically more dangerous place since you were sworn into that role, and relations with Russia have deteriorated back to almost Cold War levels.
What failed in your Russian reset and given this failure, why should the American people trust you to lead foreign policy in the future? (Remember, this is not about your opponent, but about your leadership.)
And two bonus questions:

Domestic Drama Sends Owners of Vegan Magazine to Court »
VegNews is an influential, award-winning vegan lifestyle magazine. It just won its 10th Maggie Award for Best Niche Lifestyle Magazine, and the New York Times refers to it as “a glossy magazine that is a mix of People and Real Simple for the meatless set.” It was founded in July 2000 by Joe Connelly and Colleen Holland, a vegan couple aiming to launch veganism into the mainstream.
Unfortunately, there's trouble in vegan paradise.
According to documents filed in August of 2012 in San Francisco superior court by Joe, he claims to be the sole founder and owner VegNews, asserting that Colleen is just an employee. A cross-complaint filed by Colleen on Feb 7, 2013, alleges this isn't true, and that she and Joe are now – and have always been – equal partners in the business. In fact, she says the first time she ever heard Joe's claim to sole ownership was when she reviewed the complaint that he filed against her. Something stinks, and for once, it's not home-brewed kombucha.
In documents and declarations obtained through the Superior Court of California, several close friends, consultants, and advisors who have been present since the inception of VegNews, say they believe Colleen is telling the truth.
Al Whaley remembers in his declaration, “Joe introduced me to Colleen Holland. He introduced her as the co-founder and partner of VegNews which is the organization that Colleen and Joe were representing at the convention.”
Davy Davidson states, “Not long after we became friends in 1999 Colleen told me she had met a wonderful guy in the east and that he was moving to San Francisco and they were going to start a business together. Later I met Joe Connelly after he arrived in San Francisco when Colleen and he did indeed start that business, which became VegNews.”
In 2004, Joe filled out forms for an organization known as PIPS, and lists both Colleen and himself as owners of VegNews. In a 2005 interview with Quark Technology Partnership, Joe states, “Prior to moving to magazine we were two-person operation. Aside from our network of writers all of the work was done by two founders.”
In a 2005 editorial in VegNews, Joe writes:
Finally, I'd be more than remiss if didn't recognize Colleen Holland, my partner with VegNews since the planning stages long before the publication of issue 1. She deserves at least as much credit for VegNews' success as I do.
In both Joe and Colleen's documents, they estimate their romantic relationship began deteriorating in 2005-2006, but they were able to still successfully run the magazine together, as partners.
According to a declaration from longtime friend and advisor Rey Ortega, Colleen and Joe approached him in 2008 to mediate whether or not Colleen should be considered a co-founder of VegNews. Joe claimed she shouldn't, and Colleen claimed she should. Ortega agreed with Colleen, stating she should be known as co-founder. He adds:
I was never asked to judge who owns VegNews because they both acknowledged they were co-owners of VegNews and the issue of foundership only pertained to recognition.
According to evidence submitted with Colleen's declaration, Joe acknowledged her as a co-founder in marketing documents as recently as 2006. As recently as 2011, Joe and Colleen were listed as owners of VegNews in a proposal to Eric Brent, the owner of HappyCow, a website they were considering purchasing.
However, in 2012, according to Joe's amended complaint and Colleen's declaration, relations between the two decidedly took a turn for the worse. The couple sought mediation for their problems, but it was seemingly unsuccessful, and according to Colleen's declaration, ended with Joe saying “I will spend the rest of my life making sure you do not get what you want,” and “I hope we both get cancer and die.”
According to Colleen's declaration, in mid-2012, Joe began changing the signature lines on his email to “founder and publisher”. Since the litigation began, he has added the title of “owner”.
On December 21 2012, Colleen states that Joe cancelled her two VegNews credit cards, leaving her unable to charge “critical VegNews business expenses.” She also writes:
On the other hand, Joe has taken several personal trips including to Canada, Pittsburgh, Colorado, and New York (where his family and girlfriend lives), using VegNews resources, and he refuses to account to me for expenses he incurred which are being charged to VegNews.
According to Colleen's declaration, Joe either removed her access and/or changed the passwords on VegNews' on-line banking system, the back-end server, and their internal financial system. She also alleges he changed the locks to the location of the company's business records. Further, she claims he removed her name from VegNews' first bank account, which they opened together in 2000.
In August 2000, Joe and I opened VegNews' first bank account at Santa Cruz Community Credit Union. The account was opened in both of our names. Joe and I have always had equal access to it and have used it for VegNews business. I verified the checking account balance on December 27 2012 which was $59,204. On January 31 2013, I was informed by a representative of Santa Cruz Community Credit Union that on January 25 2013, Joe had my name removed from our account. I also verified that he had emptied the funds of the account so that the balance in the checking account on January 31 was only $31.49.
Colleen's declaration continues:
Joe has now had my name removed from our VegNews bank account and my access to all credit cards withdrawn. I'm unaware of what Joe has done with VegNews money but don't believe that it was used to pay legitimate business expenses given my knowledge of what outstanding expenses we had when Joe drained the bank account. These funds are needed to pay VegNews' operating expenses.
Although Colleen is the sole leaseholder on the VegNews office, Joe's lawyers sent a letter to the managing owner of the building on January 14, 2013, saying they needed to terminate the current lease with Colleen and issue a new one to Joe.
On January 22, 2013, Joe informed Colleen that he had instructed the office cleaning people to not clean her office until she starts separating her trash from her recyclables. The letter ends with “If and when you decide to become a team player, they will gladly resume cleaning your office.”
Joe is asking for full ownership of VegNews, and $4.5 million dollars for breach of contract and fraud, while Colleen is asking for injunctive relief and for “an independent third party to take control of the accounts payable, receivables, payroll, draws, and all other financial and operational decisions that Joe and I cannot agree upon.”
To me, this is a cautionary tale – we in the vegan community need to behave ethically to fellow humans.
VegNews has been crucial to my journey as a vegan. When I first became vegan in 2004, I remember reading each issue cover to cover, and savoring every word. I looked up to both Colleen Holland and Joe Connelly, the people I understood to be the founders and owners, and cheered their success. When, in 2010, I began working as a VegNews columnist, and the magazine's Editor-at-Large, I was absolutely thrilled. I now consider both Joe and Colleen to be bosses, and friends.
To say hearing about this lawsuit was upsetting is an understatement, and I'm heartbroken to learn what's transpired. Right now, I'm personally grieving for a relationship that was once so strong, and has turned toxic. I believe that the talented and dedicated VegNews staff can right the ship, and I can only hope they're given that chance.
A few weeks ago, we caught wind of a very tiny, very inexpensive WiFi chip TI is producing. Everything required of an Internet connection – TCP/IP stack, configuration utilities, and your WEP, WPA, and WPA2 security tools is included in a single tiny chip, making this a very cool device for an Internet-connected microcontroller project. There's only one problem: TI put this chip in a really, really weird package, and there aren't any breakout boards for it.
That is, until now. [Vince] was convinced to spend some time in Altium to design a breakout board for this tiny WiFi chip. Now, if you can get your hands on a sample of the CC3000 from TI, you can breadboard out a circuit with the help of [Vince]'s design.
Included in [Vince]'s git are the board files for this breakout board, schematics, and the necessary parts if anyone has the inclination to make an Eagle library. If anyone wants to spin a few of these boards and put them up on a Tindie Fundraiser, that'd be fine by us, and [Vince] would probably appreciate that as well.
The former BJP leader Jaswant Singh was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit of the Army's Research and Referral hospital in Delhi, as he was suffering from severe head injury last night at his residence.
According to sources the former Union Minister Jaswant Singh was in unconscious around 11 pm on Thursday night at his residence, where he had slipped in his residence last night and sustained head injury. Meanwhile, the family members have taken Jaswant Singh to the Army's Research and Referral hospital in Delhi and he was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit.
The Army's Research and Referral hospital doctors said they have done a surgery on Jaswant Singh to stop internal bleeding in the head and he is still in critical situation. BJP leader LK Advani had visited to the hospital to see Jaswant Singh and asked about his health condition. 74-year-old Jaswant Singh is well known as one of the founders of BJP, where he had quit the party earlier this year after he was rejected to contest Lok Sabha polls from Barmer.
A freight train hauling coal derailed on Union Pacific tracks near Willow Road and Shermer Avenue this afternoon by the Northbrook-Glenview border.
Witnesses said the bridge overpass over Shermer Avenue collapsed in the accident.
Union Pacific Spokesman Mark Davis said the train derailment occurred at 1:45 p.m. as the train was enroute to a utility plant in Wisconsin from a coal mine in eastern Wyoming.
The train had three locomotive engines and 31 of its 138 train cars derailed, Davis said. About a third of the train had passed the 86-foot-long bridge before the derailment and the locomotives did not derail. There were no reported injuries from the derailment, said Davis.
He said a small fire occurred after the incident that involved vegetation in the area. He said the tracks being used are only used by its freight lines. No Metra service occurs on these tracks, said Davis.
Overnight and for about the next 24 hours crews will clean up the spilled coal and remove the train cars, Davis said. For another 24 hours or so after that workers will use stone fill to close up the gap where the bridge was, and install temporary tracks to get the trains moving again through the area.
The railroad will have to design and build a new bridge, which will take some time, he said.
Davis said the cause is under investigation, with teams checking out the mechanical equipment on the train as well as the bridge and the tracks.
Bob Brogan, Northbrook Fire Department deputy chief, said there was a small grass fire that was quickly extinguished and a propane storage unit that was nearby had to be moved out of the area to prevent an explosion from occurring.
There were only two people on the train, an engineer and a conductor, at the time who were not injured, Brogan said. About 20 cars had crossed over and the remainder were south of the bridge at the time of the derailment.
"We don't know why it (the bridge) collapsed," said Brogan.
Phil Perlini, deputy chief of the Glenview police department, said Union Pacific railroad officials will conduct the investigation. He said no cars or people appeared to be underneath the bridge when it collapsed.
He said that at the time of the crash, a Glenview parade was underway in another section of the town.
The clean up and repairs could take months, said Perlini.
Shermer Road was closed south of Willow Road. Shermer Road north of Willow Road remained open.
Tony Nielsen was in an office building next to the accident working when he heard the train and then "the whole building shook."
He said that while they often feel the rumble of the trains going past, he and his coworkers ran outside when they felt the building shake.
"The train was already derailed, the bridge had collapsed," said Nielsen.
He said the overpass went over Shermer Avenue and a small sidewalk parallel to it. He said it appeared the freight train was hauling coal.
"All I could see was a pile of coal and some wreckage," he said.
He said there appeared to be a fire that resulted from the accident which seemed to have been brought under control.
Rob Stein of Glenview said he was walking across the road at Willow and Shermer when he saw smoke coming from the area.
"Then the flames shot up (and) then the fire stopped. It was very spooky," said Stein, 60.
He said when he turned his head and looked near a strip mall he noticed the train cars had toppled over. He also noticed that the overpass had collapsed but he did not know if anyone was underneath. witnesses said at least two ambulances were on the scene.
Last year, a section of Shermer Road was closed as contractors reconstructed the railroad overpass which appeared to have been destroyed Wednesday.
Glenview received an Illinois Department of Transportation permit for the road closure between Willow Road and West Lake Avenue as the work took place last summer.
In November of 2009, another freight train derailed at the same location and hit a second train imperiling two large liquid propane tanks. No one was injured in that accident.
In that accident, a train headed southwest on the track derailed, hitting a train that was traveling northeast.
In that case, 18 cars were derailed -- 14 from the southbound train, four from the other, officials said. Two rail cars fell under a viaduct the train was traveling over at Shermer Road when the derailment happened. Four other cars had gone completely off the tracks.

PARENTS who refuse to vaccinate their children may lose their family benefits payments or child care rebates.
The Abbott government has confirmed it is currently conducting an audit with a view to use a carrot and stick approach to address low immunisation rates.
Almost half of the 80,000 children who are not vaccinated in Australia are the children of conscientious objectors.
Department of Health figures show the number of conscientious objectors, or vaccine refusers, has risen sixfold in two decades to 36,320. There are more than 2.2 million children on the register.
"It's on our radar. The audit is being conducted with the intention of a review of child care payments to conscientious objectors," a spokesman for the Prime Minister Tony Abbott said.
We want to hear from you: Do you agree with the proposal? leave your comment below.
The highest number of objections came from NSW parents, with 9625 registered in 2013, many of whom received child care benefits and family tax benefit payments worth thousands of dollars.
Last year Mr Abbott backed the Sunday and Daily Telegraph's No Jab No Play campaign which successfully changed laws to tighten rules for entry into child care in NSW, but also called for a stop on child care rebates and family benefits to conscientious objectors.
"If parents are receiving a childcare payment, I believe part of receiving that payment is an obligation to have your child immunised so they can safety participate in childcare centres," Mr Abbott said at the time.
The campaign led to changes to the Public Health Act.
Since January 1, parents have been required to provide documentation of the vaccination status of their children prior to enrolment in childcare centres.
Those who object have to prove they have sourced information on immunisation from a reputable medical practitioner and have a conscientious objection form signed.
Areas of low vaccination coverage included Mosman, the eastern suburbs and communities in the Byron Shire, but preliminary figures obtained by the Sunday Telegraph show that the law change is starting to work with vaccination participation up.
North Sydney Council's immunisation clinic had 215 clients in the past four months with numbers almost doubling. In January 75 children were vaccinated, compared to 40 in October and November and 60 in December.
In the Byron shire, notorious for its low immunisation rates with one in five parents registered as conscientious objectors, vaccination clinics have been booked out according to Chris Barron, Nurse Unit Manager of Bangalow Community Health.
"There has been an increase in mothers booking in to have their children immunised and the Clinics are booked out," Mr Barron said.
"There has been a higher demand for conscientious objector forms to be signed, but there has also been more parents coming to get the measles mumps and rubella vaccine because there has been an outbreak up here." Julia Wham
But practice nurse Julia Wham from The Meadows Medical Clinic in Mullumbimby, the town with the lowest immunisation rates in the state, said the clinic had seen a higher demand from parents who refuse vaccines to get their conscientious objector forms signed.
"There has been a higher demand for conscientious objector forms to be signed, but there has also been more parents coming in to get the measles mumps and rubella vaccine because there has been a measles outbreak up here," Ms Whan said.
Mosman had 43 at their clinic in January up from 39 in December but within normal range.
At the Kaleidoscope child and family clinic in Newcastle, an area with the highest vaccination rates in Australia, staff have been run off their feet said nurse manger Sue Watkins.
"We're busy all the time but we had a big increase in four-year-olds, with all the new requirements that people have their documentation up to date, it's made them more aware," Ms Watkins said.
Dr Brian Morton, Australian Medical Association spokesman for GPs said since the new year doctors had reported a significant rise in children coming in for vaccines.
Mother of two children in childcare Kathy Sozou wasted no time this week getting her 18- month-old son up to date on his vaccine schedule now required by her local child care centre.
The 34-year-old accountant from Northbridge said she was pleased laws were tougher now for children entering child care.
"I'm comforted by the fact kids should be vaccinated before attending day care," she said.
Every application needs logging. And right now there are a lot of options on what exactly to use for logging in Java. The most famous frameworks are: log4j, logback, commons-logging, slf4j, java.util.logging. And there are a lot more – every now and then someone decides to write his own logger – just go to the Open Type dialog of your IDE and type “Logger” (not to mention that some use the name “Log”). And there's also the ServletContext.log(..) and stuff like that. It is indeed a mess. But let's start with some history (note: here's another post on the topic) .
First there was System.out and System.err. But they were inflexible, so a need for a feature-rich logging has arisen (note that I was in elementary school at that time). Logging that can be customized format, that can go to multiple targets – files, consoles, emails, etc. So log4j has appeared – in 1999.
But other solutions spawned as well, including java.util.logging – an attempt to have standard JDK logging. Note a very successful attempt, as it turned out. java.util.logging appeared with JDK 1.4 in the beginning of 2002. A few months later the realized need for a common logging interface for all existing loggers resulted in apache common-logging.
The idea of commons-logging was viable – libraries should not force a particular logging implementation on applications that use them. So each logging implementation gets adapted to a common API which is used by the library – so your library does not use org.apache.log4j.Logger – it uses org.apache.commons.logging.Log, and it delegates to whatever logging framework exists on the classpath. That way your project can use multiple libraries and use a single logging configuration for all of them.
But commons-logging was not good enough. People say that it has caused more problems than it has solved. So the author of log4j – Ceki Gülcü created a new project – slf4j (Simple Logging Facade for Java) in 2005. It aims to be a better commons-logging.
Log4j has been widely used since 1999, but it was not good enough, so guess who created a new project – logback. It was Ceki Gülcü again. Why a new project? Well, combination of political reasons and old code base that needs replacing from the ground, I guess. Anyway, logback appeared in 2006. How it is better than log4j? Ceki explains here.
So back to present day – there are a lot of logging frameworks and two facades – commons-logging and slf4j. Every library uses a different one, and it's a mess. Version mismatches, tons of Logger classes on the classpath. Maven succeeds at making this simpler by at least not allowing multiple versions of the same logging implementation, but that's it. And if you don't know all the history above and which framework is used for what, it is likely for your project to suffer from that mess.
What's the solution? The simplest thing is to use slf4j and logback. Why?
slf4j has bridges for many existing implementations. This means that you remove the log4j.jar and use the log4j-over-slf4j.jar – it has the same classes in the same package, only the implementation differs – it delegates to the current slf4j implementation in use. That way all libraries that use log4j (or any other bridged implementation) will work with your logback configuration. Unfortunately this doesn't work quite well with java.util.logging, so you have to hope not to have too many libraries that have decided on a “minimal dependency footprint”.
logback is better than log4j (same author – newer implementation, learning from previous mistakes)
if a better framework than logback appears you can easily switch to it without changing your classes.
And finally, a word about the logging configuration. It should be external, in the same way (and the same location, preferably) as the other externalized project configurations. You should then load it based on a system “config.location” property.
(In a spring-based web-application there is Log4jWebConfigurer , but there isn't LogbackWebConfigurer . Luckily, it is simple to write, and there are some existing implementations that are based on the log4j one. In your web.xml the logbackConfigLocation param should be: file://${config.lotation}/logback.xml )
Why something so simple became so complicated? Because it isn't simple. There are too many factors that were not taken into account in the beginning, so they needed to be rectified later. It's a good thing that there hasn't been a major change in the field since 2006, so we can consider things stable.

By now, hopefully Jill Lepore's excellent takedown on The Innovator's Dilemma (“What the Gospel of Innovation Gets Wrong”) has entered the public consciousness, at least among those who care about such issues. For those who don't, it's an immensely popular business book that essentially proposes that established companies will get overtaken by upstarts selling worse quality and cheaper products at a lower margin. In Clayton Christensen's reckoning, the author of The Innovator's Dilemma, these upstarts then slowly devour a company from the bottom up, starting with the lowest-margin and moving to the highest-margin items.
This, Christensen posits, is a scientific fact. He mentions in his defense of the book in Bloomberg Businessweek (“Clayton Christensen Responds…”) that a Tuck Business School professor improved this theory mathematically, as if the theory was like Newton's laws just waiting for Einstein to develop relativity.
Unfortunately, what Mr. Christensen doesn't seem to understand is that scientific theories must not only be supported rigorously (which, as Ms. Lepore points out extensively, is hardly true for The Innovator's Dilemma) but it must be falsifiable. Any scientific theory that can survive an onslaught of contrary facts by simply evading them, as Christensen does by loosening his definitions of established companies, upstarts (which he calls “entrants”), and even success and failure, is hardly a theory at all. It's no more so a theory than the natural health industry's focus on “removing toxins” is.
But I don't want to spend this post attacking The Innovator's Dilemma, especially as Ms. Lepore has done such an excellent job already. Rather, I'd like to examine the consequences of this felling of a giant. I don't mean the consequences for Christensen and his status as “the Number One Management Thinker in the World”, as his website triumphs (Christensen's Homepage), nor his undoubtedly impressive annual paycheck. Given the slipperiness of the theory, it would be positively embarrassing if the prime promoter weren't just as slippery, or just as able to keep up his speaking fees.
No, instead, I'd like to focus on what this means for business as a whole. Much of the thinking (and therefore, the capital allocation) of business since the publication of The Innovator's Dilemma has been shaped by Christensen's theory. My thinking about business, as well, has been shaped by The Innovator's Dilemma, although of course I will now strive to make it less so. “When my information changes, I alter my conclusions. What do you do, sir?” (quoted from John Maynard Keynes)
Of course, “disruption” as a buzzword has been misused even by Christensen's standards for a long time, now. Timothy B. Lee at Vox, commenting on Lepore's very article, supposes that Vox and even Buzzfeed are disrupting the New York Times (Vox's Response to Lepore), as if the New York Times has abandoned the “commentary on what other people have written” and “listicle” sections of their newspaper to focus on higher-margin reporting. No, Mr. Lee, you may be successfully stealing advertising revenues, but you are hardly disrupting.
True disruption is something closer to what Amazon does, when they are willing to ship heavy, low-cost (and presumably low-margin) items anywhere in the US for free with an annual payment of $99, such as this 1 pound group of drywall screws (Drywall Screws). It's a business that likely any hardware store would not remotely be interested in, as I'd be surprised if Amazon doesn't make a loss of it.
According The Innovator's Dilemma, this is a mistake on the part of the hardware stores. Amazon will take progressively higher and higher margin products from hardware stores until they are the last company standing in this area (which, unfortunately, is somewhat ill-defined, as are all Christensen's disrupted fields. Hardware? Hardware shipping? Hardware supplies? Hardware supplies shipping?). The only thing for a hardware store to do would be to fight back on Amazon's terms, disrupt their own business before Amazon gets a chance to.
Proponents of Amazon point to the defunct bookstore chain Borders as an example of a company that did not heed this warning. From their point of view, Amazon's relentless focus on low costs and order fulfillment drove Borders out of business. Of course, the theory doesn't fit neatly, especially as the ladder structure imagined by Christensen doesn't apply to Amazon (for one thing, while they've moved into different spaces, I wouldn't say Amazon has attacked higher-margin areas).
But what if the hardware stores were right in the first place? What if it was never a good idea for Amazon to ship items at a loss, especially not such esoteric ones? Companies are frequently vulnerable in their higher margin areas, not their lower. While it's not a company, the US Postal Service provides a good example of this.
The Postal Service has never had an issue with competitors attacking their lowest-margin business, which is delivering mail to remote regions of the US. They have frequently attempted to defend their highest margin businesses, such as delivering packages and delivering mail in populated areas, both legally (through their granted monopoly) and competitively (through rates). Far from the Postal Service's existence being threatened by companies who want their lowest-margin businesses, its existence is threatened by companies, like FedEx, and technologies, like email, which threaten their highest-margin businesses.
In the same vein, the New York Times is threatened by companies which can virtually instantaneously republish and comment upon their expensive investigative reporting. While this has always been an issue (Time, for instance, was started as a collection of newspaper reporting), the speed and ease at which this is done now is a potentially mortal threat to the newspaper industry.
Now, with that in mind, the success of Amazon can be looked at in a different light. It's undeniable that some of Amazon's success comes from its ability to make a profit off of low margin items. Walmart, for instance, has become one of the biggest companies in the world in precisely that manner. But that's only because retailing has always been about low costs (with exceptions such as Nordstrom). Walmart was able to offer more items at a lower cost because of improved technology and organization. The basic idea of it was never revolutionary, only the implementation was excellent.
However, Walmart didn't enter into those areas because they were low-margin, or because they were serving a previously ignored demographic (after all, which retailing executive was surprised that people would want lower cost paper towels?). Instead, Walmart entered into those areas because Sam Walton knew he could apply technology and organization to make an overall profit while lowering retail prices.
Amazon, to the extent which it has succeeded on its own merits (and not simply its insane valuation, a valuation that is so detached from cash flow it might as well be a license to do anything), has only succeeded where it is able to apply technology and organization to sell products for less.
Therefore, any company which wishes to “disrupt” an industry must either have superior technology, superior organization, or both, or they will fail. Companies based on “disruption” that rely on using investor capital to survive in low-margin areas in order to get to higher-margin areas will never escape those low-margin areas. They will burn through capital until there is none left, and then they either be forced to increase their margins (and thus compete with established companies on their own terms) or they will fail.
So, when examining whether to invest time or money in a company that promises to “disrupt” an existing industry, it is necessary to determine whether or not that company has superior technology or organization. If they do not (and it must be a substantial technological advantage, an Android app is not enough), then do not invest. This is a lesson that Square investors, for instance, are now learning the hard way (Square's Financial Difficulties).
It is not and it has never been enough to simply enter into an existing space and offer lower-margin products. The chickens must eventually come home to roost.

We know already Deadmau5 doesn't care for bullies. But standing up to Arcade Fire for trash-talking EDM, is a fight a few steps shy of going to court with the world's second largest broadcasting and cable corporation, The Walt Disney Company.
Still, the man under the mouse mask, Toronto Mayor Rob Ford's buddy Joel Zimmerman, is preparing to face off with the house the Mouse built over a trademark claim the company has blocked regarding his signature costume ears. Disney says the Deadmau5 helmet too closely resembles Mickey Mouse, reports Stereogum, and his ownership of that shape would damage the older brand's identity.
Zimmerman's attorney told TMZ it's been 10 years since the Canadian DJ started wearing his on-stage costume and already has a trademark for it in 30 other countries, including Japan, Germany, Italy, and the United Kingdom.
Judging by Deadmau5's tweet last night, it seems Zimmerman might have been expecting this:
BOGOTA (Reuters) - Colombia on Wednesday warned its citizens of the dangers of visiting Venezuela after eight Colombians were detained in the neighboring country on espionage accusations.
“The foreign ministry warns Colombians about the risks of traveling to Venezuela,” the government said in a statement, the latest salvo in a long diplomatic feud between Colombia's conservative government and Venezuela's leftist firebrand President Hugo Chavez.
Colombian leader Alvaro Uribe accuses Venezuela of violating the rights of the Colombians arrested in Venezuela in recent weeks for allegedly spying on its ailing energy infrastructure.
The detention followed months of jibes between Uribe, the top U.S. ally in South America, and Chavez, who is wrestling with power shortages that could boost opposition prospects at legislative polls due in September.
Chavez has clamped down on trade with Colombia and accused “counter-revolutionaries” opposed to his socialist government of slashing power cables to worsen the OPEC nation's electricity crisis, which has forced his administration to ration power in much of the country.
In practice, it could be difficult for many Colombians who work in Venezuela or have family there to refrain from crossing the lengthy border. Tens of thousands of people move from one side to the other every day.
Image caption Australia and China have been trying to foster closer economic ties
Australia's central bank is planning to invest around 5% of its foreign currency reserves in Chinese government bonds, its deputy governor has said.
It will be the first time the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) will invest in sovereign bonds of an Asian country other than Japan.
The RBA has foreign currency reserves of A$38.2bn ($39.2bn; £25.7bn).
Earlier this month, the Australian dollar became the third currency to trade directly with the Chinese yuan.
"This decision to invest in China is an important one," Philip Lowe, deputy governor of the RBA said in a speech to the Australian Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai.
"It reflects the broader economic relationship between China and Australia and our increasing financial ties.
"It provides greater diversification of our investments and will help with our understanding of the Chinese financial markets," he added.
Experiment
China has been slowly opening up its tightly controlled financial and capital markets, to try and spur a fresh wave of economic growth.
Last year, it raised the investment quota for Qualified Foreign Institutional Investors twice to give them greater access to its markets.
At the same time, it has been loosening its grip on its currency as part of its attempts to internationalise the yuan.
It has announced plans to set up a special business zone in the southern city of Shenzhen to experiment with the yuan's convertibility.
It has also widened the range in which the yuan is allowed to trade against the US dollar, from 0.5% to 1.0% on either side of a daily rate set by the People's Bank of China, the Chinese central bank.
Analysts have said that all these moves are a part of China's push for a more global role for its currency.
Beijing has been trying to promote the yuan as an alternative to the US dollar's status as global reserve currency.
KAMLOOPS, B.C. — With Liberal and NDP attack ads only expected to get nastier with less than three weeks until the provincial election, Kamloops-North Thompson Green Candidate Dan Hines says their messages are falling on deaf ears.
Speaking to CFJC TV earlier this month, Hines says he's seen a substantial shift in voters attitudes based on the more than 5,200 homeowners he and Kamloops-South Thompson Green Candidate Donovan Cavers have spoken to throughout the city.
"We've seen far more people really thinking seriously about a change this election and really feeling that both parties are repeating the same stuff," said Hines. "They're certainly involved in the same cold war with one another."
Hines says today's Kamloops voters are wanting a concrete plan on resolving the cities doctor shortage, as well improving environmental assessment processes and the business sector.
If elected, Hines says one of his first priorities would be examining the health scope of the entire city to see which areas require the greatest improvement.
He adds with the Green Party refusing to accept corporate or union donations, social media has been an invaluable tool in getting the parties message across.

We're in the front seat of a helicopter
, thumping along 1500 feet above the foam-flecked waves of the Gulf of Mexico, when pilot Chuck Aaron does something you're never supposed to do. He pulls back on the controls and just keeps pulling. When the helo's nose rears up, I feel my body sinking into the seat as my heart crawls up my esophagus. We keep going until all I see is blue sky, then the line that separates it from the greener blue of the gulf. A little voice in my head is saying huuuunh? and the weight of an implausible yet true realization sweeps over me: The rotors are now below us, the landing skids above. We are flying upside down.
There's a reason why you should never, ever fly upside down in a helicopter: The rotors will bend toward the skids and cut off the tail and you'll plummet to your death. Helicopter rotors are designed to handle a lot of flexions, because each blade has to bend up and down as it moves into and against the slipstream. In normal flight, the blades bend away from the cockpit. But if you fly upside down, they flex in the other direction, giving a whole new meaning to the word chopper.
Aaron, a 63-year-old with a mane of golden hair and a bushy mustache fit for a circus ringmaster, knows all about this. He was a helicopter pilot and mechanic living in Camarillo, Calif., when he got a call from Red Bull in 2004. They'd heard that he'd assembled a U.S. Army attack helicopter from parts scrounged on the open market. They asked him: Could he build a helicopter capable of looping the loop? "No," he told them. It was impossible. End of story.
But Aaron kept mulling it over, and he thought that if you took the right kind of helicopter and modified it in just the right way, you might wind up with an aircraft that could fly upside down. Red Bull gave him the money, and he bought a pair of German BO-105 helicopters with rugged one-piece titanium rotor heads and four short, stiff composite blades. After a year of modifications—he refuses to reveal the engineering details—he took his helo up.
Success did not come easily. For three months Aaron got to know the machine, testing its capabilities. But fear held him back. "I'd get vertical and I'd chicken out," he says. "But over time I kept going a little bit farther, and one day I pulled that sucker up and as I got to my chicken point, I did one of those instant things where I said, 'I'm going for it.' I pulled it straight back and I did the loop. As soon as I saw the ground I was like, 'I can get this!' So I pulled out of that and I did it again. I didn't want to forget how I did it. So I did it again and again—10 times." From that first loop he expanded his repertoire of maneuvers, and today he's the only civilian pilot in the U.S. licensed to perform aerobatics in a helicopter.
It's a cold morning in Pensacola, Fla., when I meet up with Aaron. A big air show starts tomorrow, and with the 20-mph winds, Aaron is debating whether to take part in the rehearsal. One time, he tells me, he almost killed himself trying to perform under similar conditions. This gives me pause, but Aaron assures me that we'll be fine if we go out over the water and try a few maneuvers. So up we go.
We launch from the Naval Air Station's ramp and pass over the beach. Aaron climbs until he's above the barrier island that he'll use as a reference line to orient himself. Then he pulls up into the loop. In a matter of seconds we're over the top, then arcing downward. Aaron has discovered that this can be the most dangerous part. "If I keep it pointed down for too long, I'll build up too much airspeed," he says. "Then I'll have too many g's in the pullout and rip the transmission off."
That doesn't happen today, I'm pleased to report. Aaron once again pulls up into a climb, then startles me by rolling over to the left until our bodies are parallel to the horizon. He keeps rolling until we're upside down, then brings us back up the other side. In a plane, the equivalent maneuver would be a mild trick called an aileron roll; in a helicopter, the procedure causes a disconcerting sensation, as if someone were holding you by your heels over the edge of a tall building.
Next, Aaron pulls back on the stick and waits for his airspeed to bleed off until we're nearly dead in the air. Then he pushes the stick forward. We're floating in our seats in a low-altitude approximation of NASA's Vomit Comet. A second later we're toppling forward. As we fall straight down Aaron rotates us 180 degrees on a vertical axis so our track is like the stripe on a barber pole, then pulls back so we level out.
Aaron keeps stringing together one maneuver after another: up, sideways, down—whoop! I'm starting to think about a barf bag as Aaron pulls out of a climb and turns us into the wind. He's about to unleash the ultimate.
"Zero airspeed," he says, gesturing at the instrument panel. "This is the backflip."
He pulls back, and back, and back. I briefly have the sensation of climbing as the windshield fills with blue, and then the uncomfortable feeling of toppling backward, falling upside down, hanging in my straps, a blur of disorientation. The helicopter has pivoted, heels over head, from a standstill—like a swimmer doing a backflip off a diving board. Then we're right side up again, barreling toward the shore below. My ears are filled with a piercing scream. It's coming from my own throat. It's a scream of pure, blind, mindless joy.
CLEVELAND, Ohio -- Workers have opened the face of the historic Higbee Building to create an entrance for the Horseshoe Casino skywalk.
The skywalk will cross the intersection of Ontario Street and Prospect Avenue to link the casino with its parking garage. Construction began a month ago and is expected to continue until early next year.
Rock Ohio Caesars, which owns the Horseshoe, hopes the 175-foot-long, glass-enclosed bridge will increase business by providing convenience and a sense of security.
The federal government ruled that the construction would result in the loss of historic tax credits for building renovation. Forest City Enterprises, which had leased space to Rock Ohio, sold the former department store to the casino owners for $79 million and repaid investors for the credits' remaining value.

Four years into Codemasters' tenure on the F1 beat, and it's become easy to take these games for granted - and just as easy to forget that even before the sport's three-year-long hiatus, the games it produced were all tainted with a certain mediocrity.
Both F1 2010 and F1 2011 halted that decline in some fashion, but now, for the third instalment in the HD series, Codemasters' Birmingham studio has to dig deep to deliver a new game that can justify its existence. F1 2012, the team believes, presents a much bigger leap forward than that seen between the previous two games.
The Young Driver test's this year's other new arrival, a tutorial that comes with all the trappings of F1's official test outing in Abu Dhabi.
It helps, of course, that it's going to be replicating what's been one of the more bizarre and quite often outright thrilling seasons that the sport has ever seen. F1's not been short of classic championships these past few years, and Codemasters was lucky enough to pick up the sport just as it was breaking out of its noughties slumber, but 2012 has rarely been anything short of spectacular.
The opening seven races saw seven different winners which even included the erratic Venezuelan Pastor Maldonado - for my money, the worst driver to win an F1 race since Vittorio Brambilla, a man so excited by his one race win that he went hurtling off the track as soon as the chequered flag fell. There's been an element of unpredictability this year, down in no small part to the precocious tyre compounds offered up by Pirelli.
And so, quite naturally, that facet is going to be replicated to a degree by F1 2012. "We worked a lot on the tyres," says senior producer Paul Jeal. "It's obviously having a big effect this year. It's clear that a team like Sauber are really easy on their tyres but Mercedes aren't, and things like that are a factor now. Now you can come up against a Sauber or a Mercedes in a race and factor that into your strategy - if it's a Mercedes in front of you and it's just pitted, you know you can dial things back a little bit and wait, because those tyres are going to go away."
This detail has been enabled, to some extent, by a more nuanced physics system. "Because we've done a lot of work on the suspension, most of it just comes naturally," says Jeal. "As you improve those physics, you improve the ways the tyres interact with the tarmac. The game's definitely much more rewarding this year for people who are soft on their tyres."
And naturally that more nuanced physics system manifests itself in handling that runs deeper than previous F1 games. A certain balance has been struck for F1 2012. "It's more realistic than 2010 and 2011," Jeal explains.
There's no talk of a Wii U version just yet - stablemate Race Stars seems like it'd be a better fit for Nintendo's new console.
"In 2010, we'd nailed the high-speed direction change that you get in F1 and the super grip that the cars have. That felt good, but it was harder to lose control and when you did, it was hard to get the car back again. 2011 had a better handling model, and a more realistic one, but we think we had it just slightly the wrong way. It was really nice in the slow corners when you could scoop the back out, but in instances like Turkey's Turn 8, F1 cars don't really start losing the back end that easily in those conditions. 2012's kind of the best of both worlds, but it's not in the aim of making it more accessible - it's just taking the best of both worlds."
In hand, there's a defined difference to the way that F1 2012 feels. Coming off the back of the dramatic oversteer that F1 2011 dealt with, it's a little disconcerting at first - cars feel more on the nose, a new emphasis being placed on the extreme downforce that an F1 car generates at high speed. A little practice shows that F1 2012 is much more conducive to allowing players to find a rhythm, while still flexible enough to throw a handful of dramas your way - a couple of extended multiplayer races see many settling into the metronomic stints that define the sport, the handling predictable enough to let players work more comfortably towards the edges of their ability while being able to deploy any given strategy.
It's a balance that Codemasters seems happy with, even if it acknowledges that there's always room for improvement. "We were in one of the team's simulators this week," says Jeal. "The actual handling characteristics that we were experiencing there were really close to where our game is. We're kind of off with the braking - in an F1 car you slam on the pressure and then ease it off, and that's something that's quite difficult to get your head around but it's something that we're going to think about for next year."
Working in tandem with the improved handling is a weather system that, likewise, is deeper and more nuanced. Gone are the days when F1 used to chase the sun, and wet weather races are becoming much more frequent - when, that is, the powers that be let the cars out on a sodden track - and that's going to play a more tangible part in F1 2012's make-up.
The release date's set for September 21st, arriving just in time for the Singapore GP.
Localised weather makes an appearance for the first time - so, for example, it's possible to drive around Spa and into a shower that's sitting at the top of Les Combes before slithering your way round to a bone-dry stretch at the other side of the track. Tyre compounds are more sympathetic to accommodate this, meaning that it's now a little easier to deal with a damp track on the wrong tyres than it was in the past.
And when the heavens really open, there's a little more spectacle too. Get caught in the spray being kicked up by a car in front and the screen becomes a wet smear, leaving you to navigate using other drivers' tail-lights alone.
On the baseline, then, F1 2012 is a more tightly tuned experience than its predecessors, but Codemasters is also keen to challenge the perception last year that it hadn't added enough to warrant a repeat purchase. For the returning hardcore, there are a handful of additions that work towards authenticity - a new off-set on-board camera apes the traditional TV feed a little more closely, while the implementation of the pit-line rule on realistic settings is going to come as a nasty shock to anyone drifting over the white line whilst making an exit. Brake bias can now be adjusted on the fly, allowing you to drive, as Schumacher does, like a cabbie desperately searching for Magic on the FM dial.
Anthony Davidson of Sky F1 (and of sportscar fame, where he spent more time flying a Toyota at this year's Le Mans than he did driving one) lends his expertise to a series of hot lap videos that commentate on some in-game, on-board footage. As a primer to new circuits, it's a surprisingly valuable tool, as well as one that helps add to the authenticity of the package.
There are additions for those newer to the series as well. Qualifying's been broken down into smaller chunks for those who don't want to participate in the rigmarole of a full session, and it's now possible to jump straight into a hot lap that pits you against the ghosts of the entire field.
And in keeping with this more accessible way of engaging with the content, there are a couple of new modes that break an extensive season down into smaller, more manageable chunks - a move away from the hundreds of hours needed to see through a career into a game that can now be 'completed' in around 10 hours.
This year there's been an emphasis on making the experience on a gamepad more enjoyable - though having played on a wheel we're happy to report it hasn't had a negative impact elsewhere.
Season Challenge breaks an entire career down into 10 races, while Champions Mode takes advantage of the unprecedented amount of talent lined up on this year's grid. The six champions each have their own event where you have to take them on and beat them: Kimi Raikkonen's challenge, for example, sees the forthcoming Finn on a set of worn tyres while you've fresh boots on, and it's your task to hunt him down.
They're meaningful additions that work alongside a drastically overhauled menu system to make F1 2012 feel properly fresh. A large number of returning players, though, will want to know more than what's new this year; they'll want to know what's being done about the bugs that have blighted the F1 experience for many.
"We've had a totally different development process this year," Jeal explains. "It's something we're aware of, and I think it goes back to that point that each year the pressure's there to make more content, and the more you add the more you've got to fix.
"In previous years we've worked on milestones, and everyone's working on the same branch at the same time, chucking their work in. This year, everyone's been working on their own space and we only pull stuff across when it's ready. It's a new process and there are downsides to it, but one of the upsides is the bug number that we've got through, certainly in terms of the big spoilers, is much lower right now this year, so I think it's been a success in that regard."
It's shaping up to be a healthy outing for F1 this year, and one that expands on the past games whilst making some small steps in newer directions. Another potentially excellent take on the sport, then - a prospect that F1 fans should well be grateful for.
Hayman Fire. Crews conducting burnout. Image credit, Karen Wattenmaker. Engine crew holding fire from crossing line. Image credit, Karen Wattenmaker.In 2002, the Hayman Fire in Colorado burned 137,760 acres, destroyed 133 homes, forced 5,340 people to evacuate, and ravaged habitats of several rare species.
Following a spate of such wildfires, Congress the next year passed the Healthy Forests Restoration Act, which among other things, requires public agencies to spend 50% of their fuel-reduction budgets on public lands that border developed areas - otherwise known as the wildland-urban interface.
A new study, however, shows that this actually discourages private landowners from taking measures to reduce wildfire risk on their own property. Furthermore, by subsidizing residents who choose to live in high-danger areas, the law encourages risky decisions while draining resource from fighting wildfires on more remote public lands.
More people live in areas vulnerable to wildfire, as the human population increases and residential development pushes into wildlands. In 2003 alone, wildfires burned more than 4,508 homes and caused more than $2 billion in damages in wildland-urban interfaces of the United States.
Gwenlyn Busby and Heidi Albers used a game-theory model to get inside the minds of private landowners and public land managers and figure out why they make the decisions that they do when it comes to protecting against wildfire on their lands. Game theory is a type of applied math that analyzes how people make decisions when the consequences depend on the decisions of others.
The researchers found that the Healthy Forests Restoration Act, by requiring that at least fifty percent of fuel-reduction budgets to be used in wildland-urban interfaces, enables private landowners to ride free off publicly funded fire-prevention efforts.
Furthermore, the Act makes it more difficult for managers to protect rare species and other natural resources on public lands away from developed areas. Government agencies often seek to limit the severity of wildfires by removing dried grasses, brush, and other fuels from public lands, but tight budgets make it impossible for public land managers to conduct fuel reduction everywhere that it is needed.
On its face, the Healthy Forests Restoration Act seems like a logical, targeted way to cut down on wildfire damage. However, as the game theory model in the study reveals, private landowners in the wildland-urban interface tend to perform little fuel reduction on their land when the government conducts extensive treatment nearby.
According to Busby and Albers, this “pattern of fuel treatment comes at a cost to society because public resources focus in areas with mixed ownership, where local residents capture the benefits, and are not available for publicly managed land areas that create benefits for society at large.”

Aaron Sanchez sees some of his younger self in Conner Greene, which is why he was more than willing to share when the Toronto Blue Jays prospect sought some help with his off-season workouts last winter. The two right-handers share similar body types, repertoires and upside, making their fit together a natural one, a relationship developing to include regular FaceTime calls between a 25-year-old mentor and a 22-year-old apprentice.
“I just keep telling him he's the exact same way I was in double-A, wanting to be in different spots than where I was, being frustrated that you're not moving quickly – there's a ton of things he's going through or is about to go through that I went through,” says Sanchez. “When you can hear from somebody that everything is going to be OK, and you trust that person, then you're at ease with the situation you're in. That's where I feel like I am with him. He trusts what I say because I've been through it.”
Sanchez's support has been especially instrumental this year as Greene grinds through what he describes as his “first road bump” in pro baseball, posting a 4.96 ERA over 94.1 innings through his first 18 starts with the double-A New Hampshire Fisher Cats.
Though he's surrendered only three home runs, he's walked 58 against 67 strikeouts, lasting only 2.2 innings and one inning in his two most recent outings.
“I feel mentally tested more than anything,” Greene says, “feeling I'm ready to take the next step and not necessarily proving it statistically. A lot of the times I have flashes of it, and I want to show that the consistency could be there. And it will be there. I'm confident in that.”
The raw ability for far more, certainly, is there, which is why there's a tinge of frustration within his determination.

A seventh-round pick in 2013, Greene features a fastball that touches triple-digits, but his challenges remain both in harnessing it and using his other offerings to fully leverage the heat.
At times he can drop in a beauty curve or pull a string with a changeup, but he doesn't do either steadily enough to get hitters off the gas.
“Sometimes, because I throw so hard, I think people, my peers, everybody, we have this thought process that the fastball can just overpower all the other pitches and put the curveball and the changeup in the shadows,” says Greene. “It's just as important to throw a mixture of pitches because no matter how hard you throw, if they know it's coming they're going to hit it. So mixing it up, getting them in between.”
That can be easier said than done, but Greene is making a point of working on some subtleties of the game, learning to better understand how to read hitters' swings and apply the information he picks up on hitters to his pitch selection.
“I'm going out there to truly pitch,” he says. “I'm studying myself and the usage of my weapons out there.”
For that reason Greene says his focal point for the rest of the season is to maintain an attack mindset on the mound “without getting fastball happy,” and remember this simple motto, especially when the game begins to speed up on him: “Mix it up.”
Both are points Sanchez tries to drive home during their FaceTime conversations.
“He's a good kid, he's got tremendous ability,” says Sanchez. “When you do see him pitch, that's when he's got big-league stuff. And when you see him throw, that's why he's in double-A.”

Triple-A Buffalo Bisons
Notes: Rob Refsnyder joined the Bisons after his acquisition Sunday from the Yankees for double-A first baseman Ryan McBroom, and the Blue Jays will be watching him closely to gauge if he'll fit at the big-league level, likely at second base. Worth noting is that the Blue Jays also tried to trade for Refsnyder at the end of spring training. He's posted an .811 OPS in 523 career minor-league games, and a .643 mark in 94 big-league contests, playing second, third, first, left field and right field. … The Blue Jays also picked up righty Nick Tepesch from the Minnesota Twins for cash. … Dalton Pompey's ongoing knee issues aren't considered serious so the Blue Jays are hoping he can soon restart his rehab assignment. If he doesn't get activated and demoted to triple-A this year the Blue Jays will retain their final option on the Canadian for 2018. … Jeff Beliveau and Lucas Harrell, both recently designated for assignment, cleared waivers and were outrighted to Buffalo.

Double-A New Hampshire Fisher Cats
Notes: Anthony Alford has been activated from the DL (broken hamate bone) and optioned back to double-A. The Blue Jays would like to see him pick up where he left off before advancing him to Buffalo, and perhaps even the majors. His big-league debut back in May was made on an emergency basis and the plan was never for it to last long. … Lourdes Gurriel Jr., has been mostly playing second base since his recent promotion from Dunedin, where he was predominantly used at shortstop. Why? “We're trying to create some consistency but ultimately we see him as a player who can play multiple [spots], not just two infield positions but potentially play the outfield as well,” says GM Ross Atkins. “We want to do that gradually and see how it works.” … Lefty Ryan Borucki made an impressive double-A debut Sunday, throwing seven shutout innings while allowing two hits and two walks with four strikeouts versus Trenton.

Advanced-A Dunedin Blue Jays
Notes: The catcher in the Blue Jays system most poised to make a rapid rise through the farm system? Max Pentecost, who has 18 games behind the plate this season and is playing catch up after a series of shoulder surgeries nearly derailed his career. The Blue Jays have been cautious in putting too much too fast on his arm, rotating him through catcher, first base and DH this season, but with his talent and experience level, he could advance quickly if his arm allows it. … Adjusting to a new level hasn't cooled Bo Bichette one bit, as he's posted an .884 OPS through his first 14 games in Dunedin. … The adjustment has been a little tougher on Vladimir Guerrero Jr., who has an OPS of .566 in 12 games. … Outfielder Darrell Ceciliani is five games into a rehab assignment with Dunedin as he works his way back from a shoulder injury. … Canadian righty Jordan Romano continues to quietly put up another strong season, with a 3.18 ERA over 104.2 innings in 21 games, 19 starts and 111 strikeouts. … Right-hander T.J. Zeuch, last year's first-round pick, is back to throwing live batting practice after missing about two months with a lower back strain.

Low-A Lansing Lugnuts
Notes: The Lugnuts have had to adjust since the promotions of Bo Bichette and Vladimir Guerrero Jr., with Yelstin Gudino covering at short and Mitch Nay and Nash Knight getting some work in third. Mattingly Romanin was promoted from Vancouver and has played at both second and third. Right-hander Justin Maese is pitching in GCL games as he works to return from a bout of arm soreness that's sidelined him since May 29.

What I saw, as I passed the finish line, was a car, on its roof, way down the steep slope on the grass below. It was burning ever more furiously.
What was it? It was impossible to equate that blazing and charred heap with the exquisite, pearl-white electrical delicacy that had sat in front of my Honda, at the start line, less than two minutes earlier.
But I knew, in the blossoming, white-hot ball of pure, sickening horror forming in my heart, that it must be Hammond's Rimac.
It gets worse
The next thing that registered, as I stopped and scrambled from the car, was a pair of marshals dragging a limp body by the wrists, away from the wreck and down to the gravel path at the bottom of the hill. And I knew that must be Richard Hammond.
the window of opportunity for believing Hammond was dead was quite brief. I just happened to have driven through the middle of it.
I cannot remember experiencing such a debilitating sense of shock and pure incomprehension as this.
There we were, at the start-line of this good-humoured family motorsport event, swapping insults with each other and our director on our radios, awaiting our turns for a run up the hill.
Hammond was first, and disappeared like some weird antimatter powered javelin, almost silently. Twenty seconds later I was waved away, to be met, three turns before the end, with a flurry of yellow flags and then a world unutterably changed. Hammond was dead.
Maybe it's not as bad as i thought
However; the window of opportunity for believing that Hammond was dead was quite brief. I just happened to have driven through the middle of it.
Maybe fifteen seconds earlier, and I would have seen a dazed but intact Hammond extracting himself from his lunched but not yet burning car.
About a minute after I went into a blue funk, one of our sound men ran over to tell me that he still had 'ears' on Hammond's microphone, and that he was talking perfect sense to the paramedics.
I happened to arrive as the marshals pulled him hurriedly away from the newly burning car because they thought it might explode. But what I saw was the remains of Hammond being hauled from the burning wreckage, like some hideous vintage film clip from Formula One.
It's important to see the whole scenario, and not just rely on a snapshot. I thought he'd bought the farm, he's actually broken a bone in his knee and needs a small pin putting in it; in Switzerland, the world centre of skiing injuries and doing things properly.
Far from being dead, he'll actually come home slightly improved over the Brummie original.

Weld County's bid to divorce Colorado and form its own state is a powerful rebuke of Front Range interests that no longer align with rural parts of the state, supporters of the idea say. "The people of rural Colorado are mad, and they have every right to be," said U.S. Rep. Cory Gardner, a Republican from Yuma. "The governor and his Democrat colleagues in the statehouse have assaulted our way of life, and I don't blame these people one bit for feeling attacked and unrepresented by the leaders of our state." The plan to carve off the northeastern corner of the state — Weld, Morgan, Logan, Sedgwick, Phillips, Washington, Yuma and Kit Carson counties — and form the state of North Colorado was hatched at a Colorado Counties Inc. conference earlier this week, Weld County spokeswoman Jennifer Finch said.
Why do Republicans hate democracy This scheme doesn't stand a chance, obviously. It just points to what happens when conservatives don't get their way—they stomp and pout and whine, and then they start looking for ways to subvert our democracy.
Colorado has been a Democratic success story, from solid Red to Purplish-Blue in about a decade. I mean, Bob freakin' Dole won it the same year Bill Clinton won Arizona, Arkansas, Missouri, Kentucky, Louisiana, Tennessee and West Virginia. Now, the Democratic legislature and governor have passed a rash of good legislation, from the gun safety law that has spurred the recall of the Democratic state Senate president, to requirements that local power utilities get more of their power from renewable sources.
Apparently, "rural life" in this pocket of Colorado is all about 20-round rifle magazines and pollution.
Secession ain't going nowhere, but lucky for these folks, they have another option—they can pack up their Uhaul and move across the border to Nebraska. Or Kansas! That's two options. They can drive a little further and hit Oklahoma, if they want extra insurance that their wingnutty ways will be protected for generations. And if they want, I'd be happy to support them in a bid to carve out Dumbfuckistan from the Texas panhandle and western Oklahoma. As long as they build a dang fence and alligator-infested moat to keep them in to keep the browns out, of course.
To sweeten the deal, I'll even throw in an aircraft carrier, which they could park on Lake Meredith. That is, until global climate finally disappears it.

The Guardian newspaper today has a story suggesting that children in Wales will be disadvantaged by a Welsh-only education.
The story itself is complete rubbish, as I'll explain. But the Guardian has a history of getting stories about the Welsh language completely wrong. One might suggest that it is too consistent a pattern to be entirely accidental.
Although the newspaper seems keen to promote cultural diversity, when it comes to the UK's own native cultures they seem to be little better than the Daily Mail or Express.
The story itself is based on a false premise, which is that there is such thing as a Welsh-only education. There isn't. It should be called what it is – bilingual education.
Opponents will point out that the primary language of instruction in such schools is Welsh. But this makes sense as the primary language of many of these children's interactions within and outside of the classroom will be English.
They are still taught to speak and read in both languages to an equally high level, and their ability to do one does not impair the other.
As a result, kids in so-called Welsh-language primary schools always leave fully fluent in both Welsh and English. It's a Buy One, Get One Free deal with absolutely no drawbacks.
And when a school does switch from offering an English-only education to a bilingual education, children who are already in the system are allowed to complete their education under the previous system.
The advantages of a bilingual education
The academic literature on the cognitive advantages of bilingualism is growing by the day. Knowing more than one language has no ill-effects and does the brain an awful lot of good.
Bilingualism forces the brain to work harder (under the surface), and a harder working brain is a fitter brain.
There is evidence that bilingualism:
Improves cognitive skills not related to language
Makes the child better at solving mental puzzles
Allows the brain to avoid distractions and stay focused
Stops dementia in old age
Arguments that Welsh-English bilingual education was harmful date back to infamous Blue Books of the 1840s, but have long since been debunked.
We all laughed when Homer Simpson said that ‘When I learn something new it forces something old out of my brain.'
But that is, in effect, the argument of those who claim that being able to speak Welsh impairs children's ability to learn through the medium of English.
The key question: What's best for the kids?
One argument consistently put forward is that parents should be given the ‘choice' as to whether their kids are taught in Welsh.
But education is about the kids, not the parents. Denying them a language is to deny them the choice to speak either or both, and also access to the cultures that come with them.
We don't offer parents the choice of depriving their children of English, maths, art, French, or any other skill the school decides it's in their best interest to learn.
If a parent didn't want his or her child to learn about evolution, for instance, we'd be surprised in the school caved in to that request and taught them creationism instead.
At the end of the day, schools are not run by parents, and for good reason. Experts in pedagogy make decisions regarding what would best serve the children's educational needs.
And the ‘choice' argument also ignores the fact that nine times out of ten there's an English-only school just around the corner.
For instance, in the case of the bilingual Llangennech school, about which an almighty fuss continues to be made, there's an English-only school literally 1.6 miles away.
Enriching children's lives
So paper thin are the arguments against bilingual education in schools in Wales that one must conclude that they're mostly based on not knowing the facts.
Unfortunately this ignorance has been deliberatly nurtured by a small number of individuals who have a posionous, xenophobic hatred of difference.
They take advantage of what is always an emotive issue –parents' gut feeling about what is best for their child- and dliberately use it to drive a wedge in communities.
Unfortunately, they find a ready platform in an equally ignorant (or maliciously) biased British press.
The truth is that offering a bilingual education isn't a culture war. It's not about Welsh language v English language, or Welshness vs Britishness.
It's just about giving children the same opportunities I and many others got – an opportunity that did us zero harm but has enriched our lives for the better.
I have three kids of my own, who go to a Welsh-medium school.
Watching them play, speak, read and enjoy two languages and cultures every day, I know I made the right decision.
Yields: 6 servings
1-½ pounds Chinese long beans
2 tablespoons canola oil
1 yellow onion , thinly sliced
3/4 teaspoon mustard seeds
½ teaspoon cumin seeds
10 fresh curry leaves , torn in half
1 teaspoon salt , to taste
½ teaspoon turmeric powder
½ teaspoon paprika (or red chili powder)
1 Serrano green chile pepper
1 (14-ounce) can coconut milk
2 teaspoons vegetable curry mix (masala) , optional
Prepping the chile: Stem the Serrano pepper. Using a paring knife, create an incision in the whole pepper and remove the seeds. You don't want to make the dish too spicy; the pepper will add a nice aroma. Note: remember not to rub your eyes after touching chile pepper seeds.
Prepping yardlong beans: Pick out and discard any badly-shaped or blemished beans and wash them. Boil them for about 5 minutes in water (depending on how fresh they are), reduce the heat to low, then add ¼ teaspoon turmeric and ½ teaspoon salt. Cook for an additional 3-5 minutes. Don't over-cook the beans; they shouldn't be too soft as they will finish cooking later. Transfer to an ice bath. Drain thoroughly of all water, then pat dry on paper towels. Trim the ends of the beans and cut them into ½" pieces .
Assembly time: In a deep saucepan, heat the oil. Add the onions and cook for about 6-8 minutes until caramelized. Add the cumin seeds, mustard seeds, ginger garlic paste, curry leaves, Serrano chile, paprika (or red chili powder) and remaining turmeric powder. Stir well until fragrant. Add the chopped beans, stir well. Add 1 cup of coconut milk, cover and cook for about 10-15 minutes, over medium-heat. If the beans start sticking to the bottom, add a little water (I added ½ cup but you could add up to a cup). Season with salt.
Check the doneness of the beans. As soon as the beans are cooked and the liquid evaporates, add the remaining coconut milk and vegetable curry mix (if used). Toss until well coated. Cover with a lid and cook for an additional 5 minutes. Check the seasoning. Add more salt (if necessary). The liquid should have evaporated and the beans should be tender and creamy.
Serve warm.
Bon appétit!
The Federal Financing Bank makes loans to Government Agencies. FFB is owned by Treasury and Tim Geithner is the Chairman of this outfit, As of the end of August this bank had a balance sheet of $54b of dodgy loans. A good chunk was out to the Post Office. Another big slug was out to the National Credit Union Administration. This balance sheet shows it:
Put that together with the news after the close that Tim Geithner has done another bailout. Guess who? The National Credit Union Administration of course. The early terms of the deal from the WSJ. A few highlights:
Friday's moves include the seizure of three wholesale credit unions and an unusual plan by government officials to manage $50 billion of troubled assets inherited from failed institutions.
BK: Should be good news for the boys over at Blackrock.
National Credit Union Administration plans to issue $30 billion to $35 billion in government-guaranteed bonds, backed by the shaky mortgage-related assets.
BK: Why would they secure the new bonds with junk assets? The deal will be “Full Faith and Credit” paper. The answer is simple. If there are “assets” behind the bonds the newly issued paper does not have to go on the Federal balance sheet.We can't admit to taking a loss.
Officials said the plan won't cost taxpayers any money.
BK: Baloney. After the second bailout in so many years some losses HAVE to be recognized. The loans on FFB's books are not money good. Tim says, “no losses” on this. He is fibbing.
StarCraft II challenges you to constantly improve your skills and push yourself to new heights. There are many methods available to help a player improve, but the most fundamental one is reviewing your replays to understand what mechanics need the most attention. We're introducing a new feature, Rewind, to make navigating your replays easier than ever before.
Currently, if you had just completed a match and wanted to review the final battle, you would need to exit the match, find and load the replay, and fast-forward to that critical moment. Now, after a game ends, the new ‘Rewind' button will appear on the Victory or Defeat dialogue. Clicking on it will immediately convert the game into a fully loaded replay, allowing you to rapidly jump to any point in the match. In addition to the end-of-match dialogue, you can also ‘Quit and Rewind' during a match through the in-game menu. You'll be able to see exactly where that proxy Pylon was hiding in mere seconds!
The Rewind feature will be available in all modes that support replays normally, including Multiplayer, Arcade, and Co-op. Note that if you are in a party, Rewind will place you in your own replay and will not affect your teammates — if you want to watch a replay with your teammates, you will still need to utilize the ‘Watch With Others' feature.
Whether you're a streamer making tutorials, a commander who wants to know who's really carrying their weight in Co-op, or a ladder hero perfecting their mechanics, we hope the new Rewind feature will make reviewing key moments in StarCraft II better than ever.
More and more people are using Airbnb to find a place to stay when they head out of town.
But a Houston man says when he booked a room in Austin, he was quickly rejected because he was gay.
Buddy Fisher is that man, and he says he was shocked and hurt by what happened. Fisher is sharing his story to warn others.
Fisher went looking for a room in Austin Wednesday morning.
"It asked me when I started the process why I was coming to Austin, and I told them I was going to Austin for the pride festival," he said.
He found a place downtown that was perfectly located and well-appointed and one that had beautiful views of the capital city.
"It charged me the appropriate amount. Then about an hour later, I get a notice from Airbnb that the reservation was cancelled," Fisher said.
That's when the lister -- named Wasif -- sent him the message: "No LGBT people, please. I do not support people who are against humanity. Sorry."
"It really really upset me, because I don't feel like I don't support humanity," Fisher said.
Fisher says Airbnb quickly apologized for the actions of the lister, but Fisher says it's just part of a bigger problem.
"It felt like we've been going in the right direction, but then something like this happens," he said. “It's like you take five steps forward then two steps back."
Fisher says he's still planning to go. Airbnb has given him a list of other options for that weekend in August.
He just hopes people who open their homes to others are more accepting of people needing a place to stay.
Airbnb has a zero tolerance policy for discrimination of any kind. On Wednesday, it immediately removed the lister and said he can no longer put properties onto Airbnb.
GRAND RAPIDS, MI – Shot down once in an attempt to guarantee civil liberties for accused terrorists, U.S. Rep. Justin Amash and three Democratic lawmakers are again trying to deny the indefinite detention of suspects. The Cascade Township Republican is backing legislation that would prevent people captured on American soil of being held without access to lawyers and the criminal court system. It's essentially the same fight he led last month along with U.S. Rep. Adam Smith, D-Washington, when the pair backed a defense bill amendment that was ultimately rejected in a 182-238 vote. Smith, the ranking Democrat on the Armed Services Committee, is also a part of a bill introduced last week and dubbed The Civil Liberties Act of 2012. The two other co-sponsors are Colorado Rep. Ed Perlmutter and California Rep. John Garamendi. The group contends the National Defense Authorization Act passed in December lacks key measures that guarantee a suspect's right to appear in court and not be held by the military. The bill would also put a halt to a practice of suspects being detained by law enforcement and then transferred to custody of the armed services. Critics of the May amendment and this month's proposal say terrorism suspects should not be granted the right to silence and that they should be subjected to attempts to gain information and prevent other potential attacks. “Our Constitution does not permit the federal government to detain American citizens indefinitely without charge or trial,” Amash said. “I strongly believe in protecting the country's security and equipping our Armed Forces with the tools they need to defeat our enemies. But the American people cannot support measures that, in the name of security, violate our constitutional rights.” Follow Nate Reens on Twitter at
It was only six years ago that an inquiry into a slew of baby death investigations botched by pathologist Charles Smith set out to expose the dangers of bad science in Canadian courtrooms once and for all. At that time, Commissioner Stephen Goudge urged the justice system to insist on better-trained experts and oversight for testing facilities. He also prescribed a healthy dose of skepticism toward the testimony of expert witnesses in criminal cases.
Commissioner Susan Lang's recent report on the Motherisk scandal at Toronto's Hospital for Sick Children makes it clear that science has let us down again, writes Daniel Brown. ( Richard Lautens / Toronto Star )
His hopes and recommendations have been ignored. A recent report on the Motherisk scandal at Toronto's Hospital for Sick Children makes it clear that science has let us down again. The jaw-dropping list of failures documented by Commissioner Susan Lang include mistaken and misrepresented test results, dangerously imprecise testimony and inexplicable shortcomings in peer review and oversight. It is vital that we waste no time in extracting lessons about a problem that extends far beyond Charles Smith and Motherisk: the justice system's over-reliance on junk science. Bad science is an alarming thread that runs through almost two dozen Canadian wrongful murder convictions exposed in recent years by the Association in Defence of the Wrongly Convicted (AIDWYC). The roll call of errors in these cases includes clothing fibres mistakenly believed to match one another; experts who incorrectly concluded that dog bites on a dead child were knife wounds inflicted by her mother; inept autopsies that misinterpreted the cause of death; biology samples contaminated by a government lab technician; and hair samples that anchored a murder conviction, yet later turned out to be worthless.

It is all too easy to latch onto cutting edge science as being a final, perfect answer to our questions. However, the steady evolution in testing techniques ought to serve as a red flag. Arson experts steadily discard old theories about the origin and spread of fire as their science progresses; ballistics technicians evolve new understandings of the impact of bullets on bone or flesh; blood spatter analysts steadily refine their opinions based on new techniques. In the U.S., the Federal Bureau of Investigation admitted last April that hair identification testimony from its forensic scientists was flawed in 95 per cent of the 268 cases before 2000 it has reviewed so far. In 32 of those cases, the defendant was sentenced to death. Scientific evidence is tantalizing. It comes with a reassuring aura of reliability. Faced with the messy discrepancies inherent in eyewitness testimony, police reports or wiretap transcripts, judges and juries find comfort in cold, hard numbers and self-assured expertise. Yet, how is it that we expect our juries to comprehend mind-numbingly complex scientific data or choose between competing experts when very few possess the scientific foundation necessary to make such assessments? Unlike in television shows, where an investigation and conviction is neatly wrapped up in 60 minutes, forensic evidence is often incomplete and open to interpretation.
Wealthy defendants are able to afford top lawyers and expert witnesses, but indigent accused or those from marginalized communities frequently bear the brunt of bad science evidence. They cannot match cases assembled by well-funded police and prosecutors, sometimes pleading guilty to obtain a reduced sentence in the face of superficially overwhelming evidence. At precisely the time we ought to be exercising heightened skepticism, a mistaken belief is developing that wrongful convictions are a thing of the past.
Article Continued Below
It is the exact opposite. The sheen of objective perfection that clings to science evidence in our courtrooms means it must be policed more rigorously. Advocacy groups such as AIDWYC are indispensable and desperately need sustainable funding, as do legal aid programs, which permit determined defence counsel to probe the credentials of forensic laboratories and the opinions of self-professed experts. Judges must be better trained to weed out junk science and unwarranted opinions offered by experts. And they must warn juries about the perils of placing too much reliance on science or picking sides in a battle of experts. Scientific evidence will continue to play an important role in our justice system, but we must continually remind ourselves of its potential pitfalls. As Justice Fred Kaufman noted in his inquiry report on the wrongful conviction of Guy Paul Morin, “an innocent person was convicted of a heinous crime he did not commit. Science helped convict him.” Daniel Brown is a criminal defence lawyer and a Toronto Director with the Criminal Lawyers' Association.

TVNewser's Mark Joyella spotlighted in a Wednesday post how MSNBC managing editor Ilyas Kirmani, the former executive producer for Tamron Hall's NewsNation program, reacted with disgust to the reelection of the Sunshine State's attorney general, Republican Pam Bondi. Kirmani posted the word, "Gross," on a Facebook thread started by Miguel Fernandez, an executive producer at CBS's Miami affiliate, WFOR.
Fernandez expressed his own dismay in a single word on the lead comment on the thread: "ugh! TALLAHASSEE Fla. (AP) – Republican incumbent Pam Bondi re-elected as Florida's attorney general". A colleague of the executive producer at WFOR, entertainment reporter Lisa Petrillo, followed Kirmani's lead by writing, "Yuck."
Despite this strong reaction, Petrillo lamented about the election in general in a Monday post on Twitter: "As #Election2014 approaches all I can think of is how unexcited I am about the candidates. #FloridaBallot."
The liberal journalists could be responding to the fact the Bondi ran on a social conservative platform. Allison Neilsen of Sunshine State News pointed out in her Tuesday article about the Republican's victory that her opponent, Democrat George Sheldon, "vehemently opposed Florida's same-sex marriage ban, while Bondi vowed to defend the ban." She continued that "Bondi, who served as a prosecutor before making a run for AG, also came out heavily against the legalization of medical marijuana."
Neilsen also noted in her write-up that "the New York Times shone a light on Bondi in a story about lobbyists targeting state attorneys general."
Adding to his 2013 title, Andy Murray won the Wimbledon title after beating Milos 6-4, 7-6, 7-6 on Centre Court. This is Murray's third Grand Slam with another being the US Open. Andy Murray grabbed a second Wimbledon title with a 6-4, 7-6(3), 7-6(2) win over Canadian Milos Raonic on Centre Court on Sunday. The world number two, took two hour 48 minutes to wrap up the game. Murray took the opening set after a break of serve in the seventh game but was taken to a tiebreak in the second. On the other hand Raonic was bidding to become Canada's first grand slam singles champion. After consoling his opponent Murray, sank his head into his towel with tears in his eyes. His win in this final was his third grand slam title win which meant he avoided becoming the first player to lose in the final of the first three majors of the year. Andy Murray was on the losing end of the first two Grand Slams in the year but made amends in the third by winning Wimbledon. Milos Raonic made a place in the finals after defeating Roger Federer in the semis while World no.2 Andy Murray registered a berth after a win over Tomas Berdych in semi finals.

Andy Murray has certainly had his major moments, none better than becoming the first British man to win Wimbledon in 77 years. But there is a dark side to his deep runs in the tournaments that matter most. No man in the nearly 50 years of open tennis has played so many Grand Slam singles finals while winning so few.

US Marines are set to arrive in Australia's tropical north next month as Washington increases its military presence as part of a renewed emphasis on the Asia-Pacific, reports said Tuesday.
State radio said about 250 Marines were set to deploy to Darwin from early April as part of a process that will see about 2,500 in Australia by about 2016, according to a plan announced byPresident Barack Obama last year.
“This first year, of course, we start pretty small,” the commander of Australia's First Brigade, Brigadier General Gus McLachlan told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation.
“We have got about 250 arriving in early April. This first year is almost just a foot in the door, proof of concept, and obviously it will build up in a pretty measured pace in the next few years.”
Obama announced plans to increase the number of troops, aircraft and ships that will come to the Northern Territory during his first visit as president to Australia in November.
The move rankled China and caused concern for some Asian neighbours who saw it as a statement by Washington that it intends to stand up for its interests in the region amid concern about Beijing's growing assertiveness.
But there will be no US bases on Australian soil, with the Marines accommodated in existing Australian bases as they conduct exercises and training on a six-month rotational basis.
During his visit to Australia, the self-declared “Pacific President” told reporters at a press conference with Australian Prime Minister Julia Gillard that when it came to the region: “We are here to stay.”
“This is a region of huge strategic importance to us,” Obama said.
“And we are going to make sure that we are able to fulfil our leadership goal in the Asia-Pacific region.”
Australia and the United States also agreed to enhance cooperation between their air forces, resulting in increased rotations of US planes through northern Australia, which is closer to Asia than it is to Sydney and Melbourne.
The United States currently has only a limited deployment in longstanding ally Australia, including the Pine Gap Joint Defence Facility spy station near Alice Springs.
Roselle police are warning drivers of the risks of drinking and driving after officers stopped a driver in the northwest suburb traveling with a 15-foot tree embedded in the front grill of a car. (Published Monday, March 7, 2016)
Driver Arrested for DUI After Car Seen Driving With Tree in Grill
Police in Roselle, Illinois, are warning drivers of the risks of drinking and driving after officers stopped a driver in the northwest suburb traveling with a 15-foot tree embedded in the front grill of a car.
In a recent post on the department's Facebook page, police said a car was stopped a few weeks ago after an officer saw it driving southbound on Roselle Road with the tree still stuck in the front end.
After stopping the driver, the officer noticed the airbags had been deployed, police said.
The driver was arrested for driving under the influence of alcohol.
“Yet another reason why you should not drink and drive,” the department wrote.
The post has since been shared nearly 20,000 times.
The department said Monday that many didn't believe they were telling the truth about the story so, in addition to the photos, they released dashcam video of the incident.
The video showed the car traveling down the road with the tree still stuck to its front end. It then shows the officer pulling the vehicle over.
"Yes it is true and it happened," the post read.
Google, whose Venice office is pictured above, is under fire from attorneys… (Allen J. Schaben / Los Angeles…)
Kamala Harris joined 35 attorneys general objecting to a new privacy policy that Google plans to roll out next week.
The National Assn. of Attorneys General says the new policy invades consumer privacy by automatically sharing with all Google services personal information that users give to just one service.
“The new policy forces consumers to allow information across all of Google's products to be shared without giving them the proper ability to opt out,” the association said in a letter to Google Chief Executive Larry Page.
The attorneys general have asked to meet with Page.
Harris declined to comment on the letter during a news conference Wednesday.
Google's new privacy policy, which it announced Jan. 24, is slated to go into effect March 1. It will create a single privacy policy for all of its services such as Gmail, Maps and YouTube. That means Google will be able to include the videos a consumer watches on YouTube when it delivers search results, for example.
For women who have had multiple miscarriages, a safe and inexpensive progesterone treatment may increase their chances of completing a pregnancy. In a new study published in the journal Fertility and Sterility, two-thirds of women who used the hormonal supplement before pregnancy successfully delivered babies, despite having had at least two previous pregnancy losses.
Progesterone has been shown to help stabilize the inner lining of the uterus called the endometrium, an important factor for healthy embryo development. Progesterone supplements (also known as micronized progesterone) have been recommended for more than 50 years for women struggling with infertility, but there's been less research on how it might benefit women who get pregnant but then miscarry.
Researchers from the University of Illinois at Chicago and Yale University recruited 116 women who had lost at least two early pregnancies, and tested their levels of nCyclinE, a molecular marker for endometrial health. Those with abnormal levels were then prescribed progesterone supplementation, to be inserted vaginally, twice a day during the second half of their menstrual cycles.

The intervention seemed to help. In the progesterone group, 68% of the women had subsequent successful pregnancies, compared to 51% of those who did not receive the hormone.
The researchers believe that the progesterone caused the endometrium to secrete more nutrients, which serve as food for an embryo in its first weeks of development. (Women who became pregnant continued taking progesterone until the 10-week mark.)
Lead author Dr. Mary Stephenson, director of the recurrent pregnancy loss program at the University of Illinois Hospital and Health Sciences, says that women who have suffered multiple pregnancy losses should talk to their doctors about progesterone supplementation.
“We now know that, for some women, the use of progesterone in the second half of the menstrual cycle is associated with a higher likelihood of taking home a baby, and that is really good news,” says Dr. Stephenson. “We also know that progesterone is safe in early pregnancy, easy to use and inexpensive.”
Progesterone can be prescribed in several forms, including creams, capsules and pills that are inserted vaginally with an applicator. Women can self-administer these treatments, and they are usually covered by insurance, says Dr. Stephenson.
However, there are many possible causes of recurrent pregnancy loss, a condition that affects up to one in 20 women. Before deciding on a treatment option, she cautions, patients should undergo a thorough evaluation to determine what strategies might work for them.
In fact, the new research suggests that testing women for nCyclinE and other biomarkers may help doctors determine which patients would benefit from progesterone supplementation.
Co-author Dr. Harvey J. Kliman, director of the reproductive and placental research unit in the department of obstetrics, gynecology and reproductive sciences at Yale School of Medicine, invented the patented test for nCyclinE levels used in the study.
“We initially created the Endometrial Function Test to identify women with infertility,” Dr. Kliman said in a press release. “This study has shown that the EFT can also be an important tool for patients with recurrent pregnancy loss.”
The study was published today in the journal Fertility and Sterility. Dr. Stephenson says she is in the early stages of developing a randomized clinical trial, which is needed to validate her early findings and influence any official recommendations for women who have had multiple miscarriages.
In the meantime, those women should talk with their doctors, says Dr. Stephenson. “We've been using vaginal progesterone for some time for recurrent pregnancy loss,” she says. “We know that it's a reasonable strategy—one that should be discussed, risks and benefits, between patient and physician.”

Apple iPhones were rebooting themselves over and over Saturday morning.
Phones across the world running iOS 11 encountered a glitch that triggered at 12:15 a.m. local time. A bug in the 11.1.2 software meant that phones using third party apps to send recurring notifications, like reminders from work out apps or medical apps, would reboot over and over.
Apple did not respond to a request for comment about the glitch and it's unclear exactly how many users were affected.
A number of iPhone users took to social media and message boards to learn about the glitch and voice frustrations.
"Looks like i found this late but glad it's patched. I thought my phone was having a hardware failure, the worst iOS bug i've ever experienced. This was really bad," wrote Reddit user KarlKrum.
"This is embarrassing. Facepalm," wrote Reddit user Siannath.
This bug is causing reboot loops every 10-30 seconds. Apple Store staff in Australia are starting to get swamped by people coming in about it... just saw for myself. — J (@jeremybank) December 2, 2017
The company took the unusual step of releasing a software update on a Saturday when it pushed iOS 11.2.
The update fixes the rebooting issue and also includes Apple Pay Cash, the company's new peer to peer payment system, faster wireless charging, and new live wallpapers.

Apple typically releases software updates on Tuesdays.
This is just the latest in a string of glitches for Apple over the past few weeks.

Earlier this week developers found a security flaw in the company's macOS High Sierra computer operating system that allowed users to gain administrative access without inputting a password.
For users still experiencing the rebooting glitch, Apple recommends the following steps.
--Tap Settings > Notifications.
--Tap an app, then turn off Allow Notifications. Repeat this step for each app.
--Update your device to iOS 11.2.
--After updating, tap Settings > Notifications and turn Allow Notifications on again for each app.

When did you succumb to the Esther the Wonder Pig effect? I'm just assuming that you have, because who hasn't?
I succumbed long ago, when she first made various headlines—a commercial pig, originally thought to be a micro pig by her adopters, who grew and grew and grew, and kept growing to 650 pounds, much to their astonishment.
At first, it didn't seem too far off from the usual rescue story, but when pictures appeared of Esther living in the house—sleeping on her dads' bed and having her own piggy bed in the living room—there was something utterly charming about her. The Facebook posts were singularly hilarious, captioned with wry quotes, which would catch me off guard and make me laugh out loud.
I followed her story, but more importantly, followed her dads' story—how they evolved from hapless, accidental commercial pig adopters to genuinely concerned activists who want the world to know that there are millions of pigs like Esther. Pigs, that if given the chance to live, would show you they are as endearing and wonderful as her.
Somehow, Steve Jenkins and Derek Walter have found the elusive mixture of warmth, humor, and compassion that is just right—hence, their hundreds of thousands of followers from around the world, and the continued outpouring of love and accolades.
When I heard there was going to be a book coming out, I couldn't wait, despite having known much of the original beginnings. I cannot describe it—it's like one of those magical fairy tales that you never tire of, one you don't mind hearing night after night.
I read the book—Esther the Wonder Pig: Changing the World One Heart at a Time—in a few hours, and the only disappointment I had was that it ended too soon. I wanted more. I hope they come out with a sequel, better yet a series, or maybe a movie, or how about a reality TV show? She and her family are that addictive and interesting!
You may or may not already know all the details of Esther's story, but reading through Steve's and Derek's perspective, you'll find little gems and tidbits that weren't always in the published articles. How difficult was it to potty train Esther? What struggles did they go through with the decision to keep Esther?
I could read about Esther and go through tons of pictures of Esther as a little piglet for hours on end. This book tells a great story, and I hope there'll be more to come. There's joy and humor on every page. You feel as though you're there in that cramped little kitchen, making room for Esther's 650 pounds and laughing at her antics. You can't wait to hear more, no matter how minor the detail.
And that's the Esther effect for you! Experience it for yourself by ordering the book here.

By now, you may have heard of asteroid 2013 TV135. There are reports going around that it has a chance of hitting us in 2032.
We've been through this before. Many times. Many, many times. Like those other times, this one will almost certainly miss us. If you read a report saying otherwise, make sure your skeptical sense is tingling.

Piece of the Rock
2013 TV135 is an asteroid with an estimated size of about 400 meters (a quarter mile), and was just discovered on Oct. 8 at the Crimean Astrophysical Observatory, and several other observatories have confirmed it. It's a Near-Earth Object, meaning that as far as we can tell, it has an orbit that brings it near the Earth (hence the term, duh). In this case, it will pass near us in the year 2032.
The question, of course, is how near? That turns out not to have a straightforward answer. Right now we don't know the orbit well, and it may not come within tens of millions of kilometers of us. All we can say for now is what is the likelihood of it impacting the Earth, and the odds—as it stands today, Oct. 18, 2013—are about 1 in 63,000. If that sounds high to you, think of it this way: it has a 99.998 percent chance of missing us.* That's good enough for me, and that's likely to go to a 100 percent safety level in the coming weeks.

Most stories I've seen so far about TV135 are saying the odds of an impact are low, so that's good. I also see some that may be overhyping it a bit. One quote making the rounds is from Dmitry Rogozin, who is the Russian deputy prime minister and also in charge of the defense and space industry. He is active in working on an asteroid defense system, which is great. On his Twitter feed, Rogozin quotes the headline from an article about the asteroid (translated by Google from Russian):
Life BBC News, "a 400-meter asteroid threatens to blow up the Earth" http://www.vesti.ru/doc.html?id=1142871 ... Well, that's supergoal for the domestic space
An L.A. Times article wrote that up this way:
"A 400-meter asteroid is threatening to blow up the Earth,” Russian Vice Premier Dmitry Rogozin, in charge of his nation's space research, wrote Wednesday on his Twitter account. “Here is a super target for the national cosmonautics.”
Advertisement
Hrmph. I'm not sure I agree with that characterization of what Rogozin said; he was quoting another article. Still, it's a bit off in its facts anyway. A 400-meter asteroid can't “blow up the Earth”—it's a big planet, and that's an exaggeration. (Though I'll note for humans an impact that size would suck mightily, causing local devastation and serious global problems—here's the output from an impact calculator that will give you the grim details.) Also, I don't think this asteroid makes a good target for us to divert; 19 years lead time isn't enough to do a whole lot. I discuss this in my TEDx talk I gave about preventing asteroid impacts. It might be enough to hit it with a space probe and change its orbit slightly, but for all we know, it could move to an orbit that would hit us later. Again, as I note in my talk, these things take a bit of finesse, and certainly a lot of lead time.
UPDATE, Oct. 18, 2013 at 16:00 UTC: The sadly widely read U.K. tabloid Mail Online put up this headline about TV135:
Photo from a screengrab of The Daily Mail website.
Yeah, nice. It's technically accurate but definitely plays up the doomsday angle. Note that this is the same news venue that shamefully prints climate change denial articles; funny how they amplify a disaster that almost certainly won't happen and downplay one that is certainly real.
Specifics aside, the whole quote is a bit breathless for me, given the long odds of an impact anyway. I am not at all concerned about an impact from TV135. Here's why.

Asteroids are discovered because they move relative to the background stars. Even over a few hours that motion is apparent in a good telescope. Using some pretty sophisticated math, the orbit of the asteroid can be determined once the motion is observed for long enough, and that orbit can then be projected into the future to see if the rock gets near us.
However, it's hard to get an accurate orbit that's precise enough to project decades in time. There are always some measurement uncertainties, making the calculated orbit fuzzy; what you get is a most probable orbit, which allows you to get a most probable position for the asteroid some time in the future. But really you get a big fuzzy volume of space it could very likely be in, and it gets bigger and fuzzier the further in the future you project it.

The best analogy is to imagine you're an outfielder in a baseball game. You see the pitcher throw the ball, but as soon as the batter hits it, you have to close your eyes. Now try to catch the ball.
Not so easy, is it? The best thing is to keep observing the ball, moving around as you refine your estimate of where it will be when it gets near you. The longer you keep your eyes on the ball, the better your ability to know exactly where it'll be when it reaches you.
Asteroids are the same. If we only have a few days' (well, nights) worth of observations, our prediction for the future is unreliable. But if we keep observing it over time, the orbit gets nailed down, and our statistics get better.
What Does 1 in 63,000 Mean?

Right now, we only have eight days of observations of TV135, which is very short indeed. Trying to project that orbit 19 years into the future makes its position very uncertain. That's why the odds of an impact are so low.

How low? It means that given the most likely position of the asteroid when it gets near Earth, plus the uncertainty in that position, there is only a 1 in 63,000 chance that the asteroid and Earth will occupy the same space at the same time.
It's not hard to picture odds like that. Suppose I draw a circle 280 pixels across, and I pick a random pixel inside it.* The odds of you picking that exact same pixel at random are just about the same as the odds of the Earth getting whacked by TV135. I'd happily bet a nice sum of money that you wouldn't do it.
And it gets worse. Well, better for us, I mean: In reality, as we observe TV135 more, and we get a better orbit for it, that uncertainty in its orbit will shrink. As it happens, the Earth is not all that close to the most probable location of the asteroid when it swings by, so as we refine the orbit, the chances are pretty good that the odds of impact will get even longer.
So, to be clear: In 2032, there is a tiny chance TV135 will hit us, but it's very unlikely, and as time goes on, the chance will get smaller.

Keep Watching the Skies
The good thing about this is it shows we're still looking for asteroids, but it also shows that sizeable rocks are still out there we don't know about. In fact, while we've discovered about 10,000 near-Earth asteroids bigger than roughly a hundred meters in size, there are probably a million or so out there. That means we've only found 1 percent of the dangerous rocks in space.
This is a serious problem, as the Chelyabinsk impact showed us. Something like that happens maybe once per century, and a Tunguska-sized impact maybe once every 300 years. But it's not clockwork; it could take longer, or it could be sooner. Even though the odds of TV135 hitting us are very low, it could just as easily have had a much higher chance, and an impact from a 400-meter rock would be very bad. We need to keep our eyes on the sky, and the more the better.
NASA, as well as the B612 Foundation, are working on ways of finding more dangerous asteroids, and we still need more telescopes on the ground looking as well. Of all the natural disasters that can befall us, asteroid impacts are one we can very nearly 100 percent prevent. We just need to choose to do so.
The Microsoft course reversals -- such as the reintroduction of a Windows Start Button and the cancellation of the "Always On" requirement for Xbox One -- are continuing.
The latest 180, announced by the company on September 9, is that MSDN/TechNet subscribers and volume licensees are going to be able to get their hands on the Windows 8.1 release to manufacturing (RTM) bits early, after all. In fact, Microsoft is making the RTM versions of Windows 8.1 and Windows 8.1 Pro available to those groups today, September 9, starting at 10 a.m. PST. Microsoft also will be releasing the RTM version of Windows Server 2012 R2 to MSDN/TechNet and volume licensees today.
The Windows 8.1 Enterprise SKU will be available to MSDN/TechNet and volume licensees before the end of September, officials said today. The RTM version of Windows 8.1 RT still isn't going to be released early. (Windows 8.1 RT has leaked to the Web, however.)
Update (September 12): If you're a volume licensee, you might want to read this about how/when/if you can get the Windows 8.1 RTM bits early .

Microsoft's decision, reiterated a couple of weeks ago, was to withhold the RTM bits from everyone until October 18 , the official "launch" of the product. This unprecedented move resulted in outcry from many -- especially developers. Some devs maintained they needed the RTM bits to make sure their current Windows apps work with the soon-to-be-released update to Windows 8. (The devs also need the RTM version of Visual Studio 2013 to get their updated Windows apps ready. The near-final but not-yet-RTM version of Visual Studio 2013, the Release Candidate build, is available to developers today, as well.
Why the change of heart around early access? Microsoft execs say they heard loud and clear that the original decision not to provide partners with the RTM bits early made for "a big challenge" for those preparing for 8.1 availability. (I'm not quite sure why it took expected, vociferous complaints for Microsoft management to realize this, but at least they are responding.)
The Windows Store still won't be open early for submission of updated and new applications; that still is slated for October 18, which is general availability/launch day for Windows 8.1. "The RTM versions of tools, services, and platform are required for store submissions," Microsoft officials reminded developers in a blog post today.
Microsoft will be continuing to "refine and update the product and tools in preparation for Windows 8.1 and Windows Server 2012 general availability on October 18 and the release of Visual Studio 2013 RTW (release to Web, which is October 18)," according to today's blog post. Updates to built-in drivers and bundled apps are continuing. Microsoft plans to push these updates to PC makers just before October 18.
Third-party apps may require "final refinement to onboard" by the time of the October 18 general availability milestone, the post cautions. However, from what I've heard, the RTM versions of Windows 8.1/Windows Server 2012 R2 and the RC version of Visual Studio 2013 should provide developers with what they need, from an application programming interface (API) and feature perspective so they can get their apps in the store quickly after October 18.
Microsoft RTM'd Windows 8.1 and Windows Server 2012 R2 on August 24 and announced RTM on August 27. Officials said they had decided against making the RTM bits available to anyone but PC makers because it was still putting "the finishing touches" on the operating systems.
I'll be curious to see -- if Microsoft continues releasing new versions of Windows on an annual or near-annual basis -- whether it will continue to release RTM bits early to developers and volume licensees or try to change that historical pattern in the future.
In a move that could shift the trading dynamics of Bitcoin futures, the brokerage firm Interactive Brokers Group Inc will allow its traders to begin betting against the cryptocurrency. The firm's CEO Thomas Peterffy told the Financial Times that clients will be allowed to short Bitcoin futures by the end of this week.
The announcement comes on the heels of a strong bull market after Bitcoin futures trading began this week. However, according to the Financial Times, Interactive Brokers is handling an estimated 53 percent of the total futures volume on 4 Board Options Exchange (CBOE) --- a sudden open short potential could reverse the bullish trend.
Massive cost, massive risk
While opening the door for shorting Bitcoin, Interactive will require that short positions deposit five times the value of their futures contracts in order to protect the brokerage.
In concrete terms, to short Bitcoin futures purchased on CBOE, an investor would need to margin $100,000. This margin would be nearly $500,000 for Bitcoin futures purchased at CME, where contracts are five times the size.
With no limits to potential losses on short positions if Bitcoin continues to rise, Peterffy himself points out that betting against the cryptocurrency is especially risky, stating:
President Barack Obama's decision to send his top diplomat on an emergency Middle East peacemaking mission Tuesday marked an administration shift to a more activist role in the region's affairs and offered clues to how he may use the political elbow room afforded by a second term.
The move could pay dividends quickly if Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton helps arrange an end to the conflict between Israel and Hamas. She was scheduled to head to Cairo on Wednesday for talks with Egyptian President Mohamed Morsi after discussions with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
Clinton's peacemaking trip is Obama's clearest signal yet to Israel that it should begin to pull back its campaign against militants in the Gaza Strip. The administration knows that with Clinton on the ground trying to resolve the crisis, it will be harder for Netanyahu to make good on his threat to invade Gaza.
Obama and his administration have expressed full support for Israel since the conflict began last week, but diplomatic pressure is building for a cease-fire that would end Israeli airstrikes and Hamas rocket attacks, both of which are killing civilians.
Israel says it is pressing its air campaign in Gaza to reduce the militants' ability to fire rockets into Israel.
The international diplomatic push to end the Gaza offensive appeared to gain momentum early Tuesday, with Morsi predicting that attacks would soon end and Netanyahu saying Israel would be a "willing partner" in a cease-fire with Palestinian militants in Gaza. But the Israeli leader later made it clear he was not ruling out a ground invasion.
If Egypt was to succeed in brokering a cease-fire or a temporary calming of tensions, Clinton's presence would add diplomatic heft to make it stick. She could also congratulate the new Islamist government there for upholding Egypt's 30-year position as a peacemaker, a bottom-line goal for the United States as it remakes its relationship with Cairo after the fall of U.S.-backed autocrat Hosni Mubarak.
"In the days ahead, the United States will work with our partners here in Israel and across the region for an outcome that bolsters security for the people of Israel, improves conditions for the people of Gaza and moves toward a comprehensive peace for all peoples of the region," Clinton said before a late-night meeting with Netanyahu in Jerusalem.
She was also to see Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas before heading to Cairo, where U.S. officials are hopeful a deal can be announced. Clinton will not see any representatives of the Palestinian Hamas faction that controls Gaza and pledges armed resistance against bordering Israel.
Clinton rushed to Israel after Obama dispatched her from Cambodia, where she was accompanying him on his Asia trip. Her entry follows days of intensive telephone diplomacy, including three conversations in two days between Obama and Morsi.
"Sometimes there's no substitution for showing up," State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland said Tuesday. "The president and she obviously thought that her going and actually sitting down with leaders — with Prime Minister Netanyahu, with President Abbas and with President Morsi — could help de-escalate the situation. So it was obviously important to leave no stone unturned."
Clinton has rarely been involved directly in Middle East peace talks in the first Obama term. Her two-day visit to the region is a potentially risky high-water mark for direct U.S. engagement in the Israeli-Palestinian issue by an administration that has kept the Middle East's core conflict at arm's length.
Since his reelection, Obama has said he hopes to play a role in Middle East peacemaking but has not proposed any new plan. His relations have been strained with both Netanyahu and Abbas, who leads the moderate Palestinian wing.
Obama may have more leverage with Netanyahu than he did when the two got off to a rocky start four years ago and American backers of Israel wondered aloud whether Obama was sufficiently committed to their cause.
The president has given solid backing for the Israeli leader's security demands, including a pledge to attack Iran if necessary to stop that country from gaining a nuclear weapon. Obama also backed Israel when Abbas attempted to gain U.N. recognition for a Palestinian state.
The Obama administration refused to spell out Clinton's goals beyond helping to secure an end to violence. But U.S. officials said they hope a resolution of the current conflict could lay the groundwork for talks on a comprehensive peace deal.
Israel has resisted calls for a cease-fire that its leaders fear Hamas militants would quickly break. Because Israel has not publicly backed any plan, the United States would say only that it seeks a "durable solution."
"If there is a possibility of achieving a long-term solution to this problem through diplomatic means, we prefer that," Netanyahu said in welcoming Clinton. "But if not, I am sure you understand that Israel will have to take whatever action is necessary to defend its people. This is something that I don't have to explain to Americans. I know that President Obama, you and the American people understand that perfectly well."
Israel demands an end to rocket fire from Gaza and a halt to weapons smuggling into Gaza through tunnels under the border with Egypt. It also wants international guarantees that Hamas will not rearm or use Egypt's Sinai region, which abuts Gaza and southern Israel, to attack Israelis.
Hamas wants Israel to halt all attacks on Gaza and lift tight restrictions on trade and movement in and out of the territory that have been in place since Hamas seized Gaza by force in 2007. Israel has rejected such demands in the past.
Bondi beach will shrink to a thin ribbon of sand and extreme storm surges would reach the top of its concrete sea wall, research commissioned by the local council shows.
The latest report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, released on Friday, found the sea level would rise and could be expected to be up to 80 centimetres higher by the end of the century.
As scientists warned of dire global consequences from climate change at the report's release in Stockholm, residents in Sydney are grappling with the practical implications.
In the case of an 80-centimetre rise in sea levels, high tides would regularly flood parts of many Sydney suburbs that are close to water, including sections of Annandale, Mosman, Marrickville, Brighton-le-Sands, Sylvania Waters, Five Dock and Narrabeen.
The Buffalo real estate developer who served as New York co-chair for Donald Trump's campaign said his greatest hopes for 2017 are that President Barack Obama “dies” and that his wife Michelle is “set loose in the outback of Zimbabwe.”
True to form, Carl Paladino isn't backing down from the deeply offensive comments he made to alt-weekly newspaper Artvoice for their year-end survey of 42 locals about their wish lists for the coming year.
“Of course I did,” he told the Buffalo News when asked for confirmation that he made the remarks about the president catching “mad cow disease after being caught having relations with a Herford” and Michelle Obama returning to “being a male.”
“Tell them all to go f*** themselves,” Paladino added in reference to the News' editors who put in the request for confirmation. “Tell that Rod Watson I made that comment just for him,” he continued, referring to a News editor who is black.
Paladino's remarks sparked outrage on social media, particularly among parents upset that he continues to serve on the Buffalo School Board.
The New York Republican, who frequently appeared on cable news as a Trump surrogate during the campaign, is no stranger to inflaming controversy with his remarks.
He told the New York Observer that “there is no doubt” that President Obama is a Muslim “in the mind of the average American,” and said that Gold Star father Khizr Khan dishonored the memory of his son by speaking out against Trump at the Democratic National Convention.
Paladino's original comments to Artvoice are posted below:
Artvoice: What would you most like to happen in 2017?
Paladino: Obama catches mad cow disease after being caught having relations with a Herford. He dies before his trial and is buried in a cow pasture next to Valerie Jarret, who died weeks prior, after being convicted of sedition and treason, when a Jihady [sic] cellmate mistook her for being a nice person and decapitated her.

A "Beat It"-style streetfight is brewing in urbanizing Atlanta, pitting vehicle commuters who covet wide, passable roadways against groups that have come to be known — collectively and derogatorily — as the "bicycle lobby." This sentence, from a recent Letter to the Editor column published by Reporter Newspapers, basically sums up the anti-lobby perspective: "Atlanta was built by people who drive cars for people who drive cars, and no amount of wishing we were Portland, Ore., will make it so." Other weapons in that argument's arsenal insist that Atlanta is too hot, hilly and spread out for true bikeability and concepts like "complete streets" to take hold. Still, Mayor Kasim Reed and groups like the Atlanta Bicycle Coalition have made no secret of their push to implement new bike lanes and make the ATL a top bike-friendly town in the next couple of years. So who's right? And should pro-bike folks be concerned by opposition that seems to be more vocal by the week? To illustrate, we've rounded up a few greatest hits from recent anti-bike-infrastructure writings around Atlanta.
But first, some context to make pro-bike Atlantans happy:
Atlanta's Bike Score — an algorithm-based gauge by Walk Score that measures intown bike-friendliness — shows signs of improvement. Since 2013, the city's overall bikeability rating has jumped from 43 to 50, earning it bona fide "Bikeable" status now. That's still meager compared to the nation's Bike Score leader, freezing-ass Minneapolis, which chalked an impressive 81. If Atlanta's too hot for biking, shouldn't four or five months of sub-freezing temperatures be too cold?
The rating boost can be attributed in large part to the Beltline and recent cycle-friendly additions to Midtown and downtown, where buffered bike lanes have debuted in recent months. The Peachtree Center Avenue Cycle Track — a north-south route connecting Edgewood Avenue to Peachtree Street on downtown's eastern flank — is one such initiative. The second (and final) phase of the 10th Street Cycle Track, which links the Beltline to the heart of Midtown, is another. Both projects claimed parts of busy intown streets, and last we checked, the world has not ended.
And now for the naysaying…
In the aforementioned letter, commuter Brad Young, who's driven Peachtree Road on a daily basis for 25 years, offers these pointed observations:
"Nobody cycles to and from work regularly on Peachtree, so we won't reduce the number of cars on the road. We will have the same number, but they will move slower and extend rush hours considerably …"
"The bike lanes on Pharr Road are not inducing cyclists to use that road. Pharr is flatter and straighter than Peachtree, thus it is much more bike friendly. But no surge in bike use. So the theory 'if you build it, they will come' is nothing more than a childish dream …"
"Atlanta is not a bikeable city. It's hilly and hot, and the rain is torrential. The two cyclists we see in an average week on Peachtree are back in their cars when the summer squalls soak the streets each afternoon. Bike lanes for October and April is an extravagance Atlanta cannot afford …"
But wait, there's more ...
A few weeks ago, Jim Cosgrove, the board secretary of Buckhead's Neighborhood Planning Unit-B, offered some skepticism that a "complete street" plan would work on a vital, heavily trafficked corridor like Peachtree, adding:
"Simply speaking, look at Pharr Road. We need to decide whether we are going to drive on streets in Buckhead or going to ride on bikes and streetcars. This is about the bicycle lobby. I cannot drive my kids to baseball practice on a bicycle."
Also in Reporter Newspapers, native Oregonian Jaci Johnson chimes with a short letter that insists biking infrastructure is no kind of panacea:
"If Atlanta really wants to spend its money wisely, it will standardize Peachtree's turn signals and turn lanes in order to have a consistent flow up and down the overly traveled street. It will pay attention to the horrible and rapidly deteriorating road conditions … If a greener city is desired, there are many fine programs that have their origins in Oregon. Biking lanes are not one of them."
Even the AJC's city-prowling and typically levelheaded columnist Bill Torpy took a cynical stance on efforts to enhance biking infrastructure earlier this month. He wrote:
"The fit fellows in Lycra shorts have inordinate clout. Only about 1 percent of Atlanta area commuters are bikers, according to Census surveys, (an optimistic number) but planners are increasingly calling to erase traffic lanes to give them elbow room …"
"Increasingly, terms like 'road diet,' or 'complete streets' or 'road rightsizing,' are thrown about in well-intentioned Orewellian Speak … 'Road choking' might be more precise …"
"A couple years back, Mayor Kasim Reed announced the city would double bike-friendly lanes to 120 miles by the end of 2016. The idea is build it and they will come … One day, perhaps, 2 percent will commute by bike."
Would anyone like to offer a rebuttal?

After a grueling day of over 12 hours of press for Star Wars: The Last Jedi, Laura Dern nursed a cup of coffee and settled in for an extended chat with a very different crowd: the Film Society of Lincoln Center. The event took place at 8:00 P.M. on Thursday, December 14, meaning everyone in attendance had deliberately foregone taking in the first showing of the new Star Wars movie.
But there was still plenty of chatter surrounding her role as Vice Admiral Amilyn Holdo, the flashy topper on not only a great year, but a great set of years. After a relatively quiet first decade of the 2000s, Dern has reestablished herself as a titan of both the small and silver screen. In 2017 alone, she won an Emmy for her fierce portrayal of Renata Klein in HBO's Big Little Lies, reunited with her longtime collaborator David Lynch in Showtime's Twin Peaks: The Return, and now features prominently in what will almost assuredly become the year's top grossing film.
While the Film Society of Lincoln Center dedicated an entire day of programming to some of her early works (Joyce Chopra's Smooth Talk, David Lynch's Wild at Heart and Alexander Payne's Citizen Ruth), her 90-minute talk focused exclusively on her work over the past few years. The wide-ranging discussion covered how she landed some of her recent roles, her experiences working with an eclectic set of directors and some of her thoughts on the industry at large.
The Journey to Star Wars
Dern said she found it quite easy to abide by the strict rules of Star Wars spoiler culture thanks to preparation she received over 30 years ago:
“I can say how lucky I am to have found David Lynch at 17. When I first met him and had to do press for him differently than other directors, preceding that, he said, ‘Your job is to tell them NOTHING!' So it was a seamless transition into Star Wars.”
Dern grew up a big fan of the Star Wars series and she recounted how The Last Jedi writer/director Rian Johnson approached her to journey to a galaxy far, far away:
“One of my favorite memories of talking to a filmmaker is that I was asked to lunch by Rian Johnson […] I had seen his film Looper, which I thought was quite brilliant and he was an interesting independent filmmaker. He had written a role that he was interested in talking to me about and had thought of me as he was writing, which is a great compliment. He described the role as complicated, powerful woman in a position of power in which there is a deep grey area. Whether she is light or dark, and what her real moral compass is. I was like, ‘Oh, this sounds like my kind of part!' And he said, ‘You know in this world, Star Wars…' I said well, ‘That's so interesting, imagining this kind of contained film in that world, sort of like space, meaning it's boundary-less.' And he said, ‘No, no, no. It is Star Wars!'”
While the Internet has gone gaga over the novelty of “Space Dern,” the look of Vice Admiral Holdo was very deliberately designed to put Dern's gender front and center:
“In considering what she should look like, Rian is so brilliant and subversive in a really beautiful way […] it was really important to him that we create a really feminine leader and what that might do to everyone around her. The hair, the space jewelry, the dress… [I worked with costume designer] Michael [Kaplan], Kathy Kennedy was very involved, Ram [Bergman] his producing partner since they started in independent film. Everyone weighed in, but I loved the idea that this position of power, this female powerful leader, immediately throws people off because she comes in looking like a woman and not like one of the boys. It's a great starting place in space.”
Without giving away the details of the time they share on screen, Dern also spoke movingly about the time she spent with Carrie Fisher:
“She's incredible. As much as you might try to attempt in your art to let go of the veil and try to be your most authentic self, there is no greater teacher than Carrie. Reflecting on this last year, Wonder Woman being one of the films where people were in awe of a complicated, dynamic female superhero, to think back on the mid-'70s, Carrie Fisher gave us a complicated, sassy, brazen, angry, beautiful female superhero. It's just remarkable. Having been around her, she leads with an unapologetic self. That is who she presented to the world. And her own complications as a person, in her writing, she was extraordinary. Regardless of what you think is honest, the minute Carrie enters into the room, she requires that level from all of you. It changes the entire space that you're in. It's very beautiful, and I feel privileged.”
Working With David Lynch
“Maybe I'm weird,” Dern replied when asked about why she opted to work with artists like David Lynch and Peter Bogdanovich in the '80s while her teenage peers headlined films for John Hughes.
In her capacity as one of the few people to speak Lynchian dialogue fluently, she sums up his work as “honest and simple and totally off-kilter and the ultimate dive into the shadow […] David holds equally true the genuine and the insane.” When asked her thoughts on Twin Peaks: The Return, Dern sang the praises of her director:
“I think David Lynch is our greatest artist working. Everything that I've had the privilege being part of, it can take a decade for people to catch up and have deep gratitude for it. But if we're looking for the boundary breaker and someone who is exploring cinema and sound and music and character and fine art into this medium, with not only zero boundary but zero consideration for if it's going to work, is there an audience for it, will it be seen, how do we present it. He's just in it. And I'm so grateful to get to work around someone like that. He comes from the purest place. And he learns every day, and he wants to push himself. And he makes art every day.”
As an actor with the privilege to work for many great directors on a continuing basis, and others just on a one-off project, Dern says that relationship with Lynch allows for a particularly special kind of working relationship:
“I think there are a few where you get each other in a very specific kind of way where there needs no language. That's the best. But with that said, there are filmmakers who know exactly what they want, and it's the greatest inspiration in the world. Paul Thomas Anderson [her director in 2012's The Master] knows exactly what he wants. He's meticulous and an insane inventor like nothing you've ever seen, and that's also extraordinary and a different energy. I don't know that actors change what they do, but maybe they pretend to listen to people? David is just so particular because he knows me so well and only gives me one word direction. He'd kill me if I tried to have a conversation about the character. He's like, ‘I need wind.'”
Like everyone else watching, Dern had little idea where Twin Peaks: The Return was going on a week-by-week basis:
“There were a few storylines where David showed me some scenes early on, and I watched the filming of a few specific things. I had some friends who were musicians that did some of the pieces in it. I got to be around a lot of it to know where it was going, but specifics of scripted pages, there was so much I didn't know [until air].”
Lynch was apparently plugged into fan reaction to the show enough to send Dern this meme of her character Diane:
For fans of rock music like myself, today is an anniversary of great importance to the genre. Released twenty years ago to the day, a little known grunge rock trio saw the release of their latest album, hoping to themselves that the album might see them get as much recognition as other grunge bands like Sonic Youth and the Melvins. That band was called Nirvana, that album Nevermind, and not only would the album earn them more recognition than either Sonic Youth or the Melvins, but would propel them to super stardom change, gave birth to alternative rock, and alter the sound and of music itself in the process.
Nirvana is with little doubt one of, if not the, most influential band of the last twenty years. Regarded by many to be the voice and sound of a generation, and rightly so to some extent, you never would have known what the future held for the band at the time. One of many bands of Seattle's famous grunge underground, the unkempt trio made up of Kurt Cobain, Krist Novoselic and Dave Grohl had just come off the release of the bands first album, Bleach, and the album had bet with some minor recognition from critics and fans. Hoping to capitalize a little more on that momentum, as well as keep the bills paid, they began work on thier next studio album, pouring a year worth of effort into what would become one of the greatest rock albums of all time.
That album, entitled Nevermind, was successful beyond anybodies expectations. With that now famous cover featuring a baby chasing a dollar bill in a pool, and twelve tracks featuring a wide and diverse sound and feel, it was unlike anything ever seen before, or since. It tapped into the angst and anguish of the rising generation, resonating with certain crowds and circles in ways no other band had at until that point. That resonance quickly showed in record sales, selling 400,000 copies a week in the US alone, and in the process knocked Michael Jackson's Dangerous from the number one spot on the charts, both literally and symbolically putting the glam and glitz of the 1980s in its grave, and ushering in the dark, gritty sound that would dominate the airwaves for over the next decade. Leading the charge of course, were many of the songs of Nevermind, with immortal classics like ‘In Bloom', ‘Breed', ‘Come as You Are', ‘Lithium', and of course, the legendary ‘Smells Like Teen Spirit'.
If there has ever been a song that captured the spirit of rebellion in the heart of every teen, dreamer or outcast, it would be ‘Smells like Teen Spirit'. From the first opening strummings of the guitar and the boom of Grohl's drums, the the closing wails of Kurt Cobain, it is melodic and powerful in ways any classic rock song should be. No doubt that is why an entire generation has adopted it as their anthem, ironically, much to the disdain of the band itself. Yet to millions of people since 1991, the song has struck a chord straight to the soul, a revolutionary anthem for all the folks who felt like no one had spoken for them. That universal appeal and capturing of raw emotion is a huge reason why the song became the song that captured the soul of a generation, and one of the greatest songs of any generation.
Nevermind was one of those rare albums released at the perfect moment that allowed it to resonate with the people and be allowed to wreck and replace the derelict sound that came before it. It has to date sold 30 million copies, and is widely regarded as one of the greatest albums of all time – a feat unlikely to change anytime soon in an industry more focused on singles and remixes than on albums. Nirvana would usher in the era of alternative rock, a sound which would rule the airwaves long after Kurt Cobain's untimely suicide, and bands like the Offspring, Linkin Park, and the Foo Fighters (fronted by Nirvana drummer David Grohl) would carry on the good fight long after his passing. For all of Cobain's hatred of the trappings of rock stardom, he would be the last truly universal rock star, Nirvana one of rock's last great band, Nevermind it's last classic album, with the band and it's sound the gold standard for all the bands that followed.
Even now, in the dark night of the soul of rock and roll, Nirvana and Nevermind are just as relevant as it was back in 1991. In a music industry all too tragically dominated by quickly passing pop stars and thrice-watered down rap and R&B, perhaps even more relevant with the utter lack of much of a rock scene that aside from a few older bands still going strong, is dominated by the hipster indie sound. So until some new rock star comes along and sets the music world ablaze, and burning down the old industry sound like Cobain and company did before them, Nirvana will continue to be the torch bearer of the rock world. If Nevermind is any indication, we could do worse for rock's guiding light.
An abrupt cooling in Europe together with an increase in humidity and particularly in windiness coincided with a sustained reduction in solar activity 2800 years ago. Scientists from the German Research Centre for Geosciences GFZ in collaboration with Swedish and Dutch colleagues provide evidence for a direct solar-climate linkage on centennial timescales. Using the most modern methodological approach, they analysed sediments from Lake Meerfelder Maar, a maar lake in the Eifel/Germany, to determine annual variations in climate proxies and solar activity.
The study published online this week in Nature Geoscience reports the climatic change that occurred at the beginning of the pre-Roman Iron Age and demonstrates that especially the so-called Grand Minima of solar activity can affect climate conditions in western Europe through changes in regional atmospheric circulation pattern. Around 2800 years ago, one of these Grand Solar Minima, the Homeric Minimum, caused a distinct climatic change in less than a decade in Western Europe.
The exceptional seasonally laminated sediments from the studied maar lake allow a precise dating even of short-term climate changes. The results show for a 200 year long period strongly increased springtime winds during a period of cool and wet climate in Europe. In combination with model studies they suggest a mechanism that can explain the relation between a weak sun and climate change. "The change and strengthening of the tropospheric wind systems likely is related to stratospheric processes which in turn are affected by the ultraviolet radiation" explains Achim Brauer (GFZ), the initiator of the study. "This complex chain of processes thus acts as a positive feedback mechanism that could explain why assumingly too small variations in solar activity have caused regional climate changes."
Albeit those findings cannot be directly transferred to future projections because the current climate is additionally affected by anthropogenic forcing, they provide clear evidence for still poorly understood aspects of the climate system, emphasizes Achim Brauer. In particular, further investigations are required with a focus on the climatic consequences of changes in different wavelengths of the solar spectrum. Only when the mechanisms of solar-climate links are better understood a reliable estimate of the potential effects of the next Grand solar minimum in a world of anthropogenic climate change will be possible. In this respect, well-dated annually laminated lake sediments are also in future of crucial importance for these studies.
Therefore, scientists from the German Research Centre for Geosciences (GFZ) and other institutions search for such archives around the world in order to to obtain a more accurate approach to the solar-climate relationship and the different regional responses.
A photographer was left stunned when her nonverbal son with Down syndrome took a spectacular photo of what she believes is his guardian angel.
Seven-year-old Aasher Liles, named by his parents with an extra A to reflect his extra chromosome, took the photo using his mother Kerri's cell phone on a flight home to Houston, Texas.
When she took her phone back and scrolled through her camera roll, she was astonished by what she saw.

Ms Liles wrote on her Facebook page: 'Yesterday we were flying back to Houston from Washington and my 7 year old, who's recently become obsessed with taking pictures with our cell phones, wanted to take some pictures out of the window after I had reached across him to take one myself.
'After he took a few dozen, I took the phone back and later went through the images to delete since my storage was getting low.
'As I was deleting, I came across this one close to the middle of all of his cloud and plane wing pics.'

Speaking to Chron.com, she added: 'We've known for a long time that AAsher has a sixth sense about others' needs. Whether it be a hug or a smile. He just seems to gravitate to strangers in need.
'He will let us know when he sees something by pointing and flapping his arms like wings. So, we've known he can see angels that surround him.
'I do believe that he captured his angel out the window that day to bring him comfort in a rather bumpy takeoff.'
UN Human Rights Council President (right) in Jeddah addressed
a Saudi-hosted conference on religious freedom
GENEVA, June 4, 2015 – Despite its reputation as one the world's worst violators of religious freedom, Saudi Arabia is now hosting in Jeddah a UN human rights conference on combating intolerance and discrimination based on religion or belief, attended by the president of the UN Human Rights Council and other top international representatives.
“It's time for the politics of oil to stop trumping the basic principles of human rights,” said Hillel Neuer, executive director of the Geneva-based UN Watch, a non-governmental human rights group.
“It's bad enough that the oppressive and fundamentalist Saudi monarchy was elected to sit on the UN Human Rights Council. But for top UN human rights officials to now visit Jeddah and smile while human rights activist Raif Badawi languishes in prison for the crime of religious dissent, still under threat of further flogging, is to pour salt in the wounds. It's astonishing.”

UN Watch expressed alarm that the participation of Ambassador Joachim Ruecker, president of the UN Human Rights Council, would grant “false international legitimacy to a regime that beheads people in the town square, systematically oppresses women, Christians, and gays, and jails innocent bloggers like Raif Badawi for the crime of challenging the rulers' radical brand of Wahabbist Islam.”
The Obama Administration sent two top envoys to participate, religious freedom ambassador David Saperstein, and Arsalan Suleman, Acting Special Envoy to the Organization of Islamic Cooperation. Also, Heiner Bielefeldt, UN Special Rapporteur on freedom of religion or belief, addressed one of the panels.
“We urge the council president, the UN expert, and the two U.S. envoys to, at a minimum, denounce Saudi Arabia for its gross and systematic violation of Article 18 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which guarantees freedom of religion. He should also demand that Saudi Arabia end its subjugation of women, in violation of the Article 2 equality guarantee.”
Heiner Bielefeldt, UN Special Rapporteur on freedom of religion or belief, in Jeddah
The Jeddah conference is the 5th meeting under what is called the “Istanbul Process” to implement the controversial UN Human Rights Council Resolution 16/18, entitled “Combating Intolerance, Negative Stereotyping and Stigmatization of, and Discrimination, Incitement to Violence and Violence Against, Persons Based on Religion or Belief.”
Hosted by the 56-nation Organization of Islamic Cooperation, the official purpose of the meeting is to “discuss the effective implementation of Resolution 16/18 by building on existing initiatives and identifying new collaborative opportunities.”
Today, the 10th of May, is World Lupus Day.
This year, I've been asking lupies to complete the sentence:

It's hard to enjoy summer not being in the sun. (Julie)
it steals your life. (Claire)
we have to take so many different medications to treat our chronic illness. (Cheryl)
it's aptly named the wolf because it sneaks up & attacks the mind, body, & soul. It tears a person to shreds until there is nothing left. The more pain it inflicts - the better it seems to enjoy it.When you think it's finished with you - it returns to inflict more pain and suffering. Lupus bites???- It sure does..... (Cheryl)
it nearly killed me. (Scott)
I wanted to be a doctor but who wants a doctor that can't be around infectious people? (Kate)
it's extremely unpredictable! (Teresa)
it is hard to diagnose and it took 3 years of pain, belittling, and exhaustion for someone to finally hear me. (Hollie)
I'm sick, but I don't look sick; I felt 70 when I was 17; none of my family or friends can really understand what I go through. (Joyce)
it robs me of what tomorrow might be. Everyday before I open my eyes I take inventory of my body. What moves, hurts and what doesn't. (Mary)
I like going outside, I like having fun,
but the rays are bad from certain lights and the Sun,
it hurts so bad when there's so much to do,
it doesn't always growl to warn, that it's about to hurt you.
Lupus bites.
I'm too young to feel this old! (Patricia) it has taken friends away from me, and taken their lives away from them. (Beth)
there's only so many times you can cancel at the last minute before people stop asking you to do things. (Iris)
it causes pain! Lupus bites all my joints. (Cheryl)
everyone doesn't believe the horrible pain I go through.Lupus bites when lupus wants to cause pain.﻿ (Valerie)
sometimes you forget you have it and pay the price later when you can't get out of bed or worse have to be hospitalized. (name not given)
I leave in my car to run errands, and get a mile down the road and forget where I had plans to go. So then I go through the coffee stand and treat myself. (name not given)
I have a great boyfriend but I'm married to my many pills and insurance. (name not given)
Keeping with the theme of today's post, I've added a new design (well, a variation on an older design) to the Shirt Shop.
I like going outside, I like having fun,but the rays are bad from certain lights and the Sun,it hurts so bad when there's so much to do,it doesn't always growl to warn, that it's about to hurt you.Lupus bites.(Mike)And finally, my response....it does't just affect me. It also affects everyone who cares about me. It means I am unreliable. I let people down, and I hate that.

The actual genesis of The Beatles is a bit nebulous and could be argued. However, most Beatles historians cite the date of July 6, 1957 as the official beginning of The Beatles.
John Lennon, a Liverpool guitar player (and local troublemaker, part-time shoplifter and full-time egomaniac) had been playing a few local gigs in the area for a year or so. John's initial band was called The Blackjacks, consisting of a few of his mates from school. Soon thereafter, the band's name was changed to The Quarrymen, in honor of their present school, Quarry Bank High School.
It was on July 6, 1957 that John and his ragtag band were playing twice at the St. Peter's Church fete in the Woolton parish. This date is significant as possibly the single most important seminal date in the history of rock music. Why? It was on this day that John Lennon and Paul McCartney first met.
The Quarrymen, led by John, played on the back of a coal truck, giving one performance in the afternoon and another in the early evening. Several cameras were out that day, and the very brash Lennon took the lead vocals on a few of the popular rock'n'roll songs of the day. Lennon was decked out in a checked shirt, tight pants ("drainies'), and his hair was slicked-up in the fashion of his supreme idol, Elvis Presley.
The event was a bit bittersweet, too, although Lennon didn't know it at the time. John's beloved mother, Julia, was there in the crowd, rabidly cheering her teenage son on. As a sad sidebar, Julia was to be killed tragically, a little over a year later, in a car accident. Julia was killed by a drunken off-duty policeman as she was walking across the street to catch a bus. John was never to really get over the loss of his mother, and called it "the worst thing that ever happened to me."
Paul had been invited to watch The Quarrymen by a mutual friend, and he watched with curious interest as John sang. John and his Quarrymen were actually scheduled to play twice that day, once in the afternoon and later in the evening. After the band's first concert Paul was introduced to John, who, Paul later recalled, had breath smelling of illegally-obtained beer.
The two budding musicians were introduced by Paul's pal, Ivan Vaughn. Interestingly, Ivan was born on the exact same day as Paul (June 18, 1942). After a brief introduction, Paul played John the song "Twenty Flight Rock" by Eddie Cochrane. John carefully noticed Paul's talent, even at that young age (Paul was 18 months younger than John -almost an eternity for teenagers). Paul also impressed the older Lennon with a few chords John was unfamiliar with.
John was suitably impressed. "I dug him," John was to recall. John remembered asking Paul to join his fledgling band the next day. Paul recalls a longer time lag and recalls bicycling around when Ivan rode up to him and relayed John's message, asking him if he wanted to join The Quarrymen.
John recalled that he had to make the momentous decision by weighing in two factors. "I was the kingpin," he was to recall. John knew he was, by far, more talented than his fellow bandmates. But he also knew how talented Paul was from their initial meeting. He instinctively knew that with Paul's obvious talent and personality, his agreed-upon and unquestioned position as the group's leader would be in jeopardy, or at least lessened to a degree. "I had to decide whether to make myself stronger or make the group stronger," John recalled. Fortunately, for the sake of music fans the world over, John decided to "make the group stronger" and asked Paul to join.
Although Paul was invited and he accepted sometime in July of 1957, he did not join the Quarrymen right away. Paul and his kid brother Michael were scheduled to go away on a summer Boy Scout jamboree in the following weeks. It was at this Boy Scout jamboree that the young Paul made his public singing debut, getting up and singing in front of his fellow Scouts and Scoutmasters, along with brother Mike. On October 18, 1957, Paul McCartney made his actual singing debut with John Lennon and their now-mutual band, The Quarrymen. The historic occasion took place at the local dance joint called The Conservative Club.
Paul was extremely nervous, and during his first-ever solo number, his voice kept cracking, much to the gleeful delight of John, who kept breaking up every time Paul's voice cracked. Ridicule aside, John and Paul were soon to become inseparable "best mates." The two would often play hookey from school together, sneak into Paul's empty house, and play records, chat, and fill Paul's dad's pipe with tea leaves and "have a smoke."
Paul was soon to show John the first song he ever composed, "I Lost My Little Girl." This spurred John into composing, too, and soon John came up with his first composition, the similarly titled "Hello Little Girl." Soon the two boys started composing songs together. Paul kept the songs neatly arranged in a notebook and each new tune was listed as "another Lennon-McCartney original."
The two soon made a lifelong pact and earnestly shook on it. This handshake was the only actual bond the two had; they never signed a written contract as co-composers. Although both John and Paul continued to compose songs on their own, too, they never broke their pact and every song, whether solo or co-written, was given the Lennon-McCartney label.
Strangely, on the Beatles' first album, 1963's Please Please Me, the songs were credited as "McCartney-Lennon." But this was to be the exception to the rule, a John's slightly stronger personality made sure the "Lennon-McCartney" handle stuck forever after. Even when Paul composed a motion picture score completely alone for a 1966 film called The Family Way, he still made sure his partner Lennon received half of all royalties. With over 200 Lennon-McCartney songs composed over the next decade, John and Paul were to become the most beloved and successful songwriting team in the history of popular music.
Following Meryl Streep and Patricia Arquette's public statements about sexism in Hollywood, Kristen Stewart is now following suit.
The Twilight star, who recently made history for becoming the first American actress to win France's César award, speaks frankly about gender politics in a new interview with Harper's Bazaar U.K. “Women inevitably have to work a little bit harder to be heard,” she tells the magazine. “Hollywood is disgustingly sexist. It's crazy. It's so offensive it's crazy.”
Stewart does not get into specifics about her experiences or observations—at least in the excerpts released thus far; the full interview is not yet available online. But she joins peer Carey Mulligan in denouncing the lack of opportunities for females in the industry.
“In terms of the amount of interesting roles there are for women it's obviously massively sexist,” Mulligan told Time Out London, according to The Guardian. “There's a lack of material for women. A lack of great stories for women.”
Speaking about her upcoming film Suffragette, about the campaign for women's voting rights in the U.K., Mulligan said, “The mere fact that it's taken 100 years for this story to be told is hugely revealing. . . . This is the story of equal rights in Britain, and it took years of struggle and women being tortured, abused, and persecuted, and it's never been put on-screen. It's such a reflection of our film industry that that story hasn't been told yet.”
During a panel last week, Mulligan's Suffragette co-star Streep offered her own theory why there aren't more female-driven films—because men are not able to empathize with women as easily as women can empathize with men, and as such, movies about women, which will only theoretically appeal to one gender, are less likely to be made. In her words:
“This active empathy that women go through from the time we are little girls, we read all literature. All history. It's really about boys, most of it. But I can feel more like Peter Pan than Tinkerbell or Wendy. I wanted to be Tom Sawyer, not Becky. And [women] are so used to that active empathizing with a protagonist of a male-driven plot. That's what we've done all of our lives—you read history history, you read literature, Shakespeare. It's all fellas. But [men] have never had to do the other thing. And the hardest thing, for me, as an actor is to have a story that men in the audience feel like they can know what I feel like. It's very hard for them to put themselves in the shoes of a female protagonist.”
In Patricia Arquette's Oscar acceptance speech earlier this year, the Boyhood star used her moment at the podium to remind the room that sexism extends beyond the amount of roles available for females and the scope of Hollywood. “To every woman who gave birth. To every tax payer and citizen of this nation, we have fought for everybody else's equal rights,” she said to cheers from the audience, and a standing ovation from Streep. “It's time to have wage equality once and for all, and equal rights for women in the United States of America.”
Want to give it a shot, Hollywood? Being called “massively sexist” and “disgustingly sexist” by two of your most talented young actresses, and knocked by your greatest living actress, all in the span of one week, is certainly not great for your reputation.

“These new media have made our world into a single unit,” Marshall McLuhan observed in 1960, when he made the case for the emergence of a “global village”. Meanwhile, in the half-century since McLuhan's meditations, scientists and philosophers alike have become increasingly occupied with the study of consciousness — what it is, how it works, and how it shapes our sense of self.
In Consciousness: Confessions of a Romantic Reductionist (public library), neuroscientist Christof Koch — “reductionist, because I seek quantitative explanations for consciousness in the ceaseless and ever-varied activity of billions of tiny nerve cells, each with their tens of thousands of synapses; romantic, because of my insistence that the universe has contrails of meaning that can be deciphered in the sky about us and deep within us” — explores how subjective feelings, or consciousness, come into being. Among Koch's most fascinating arguments is one that bridges philosophy, evolutionary biology and technofuturism to predict a global Übermind not unlike McLuhan's “global village,” but one in which our technology melds with what Carl Jung has termed the “collective unconscious” to produce a kind of sentient global brain:
The ever-increasing complexity of organisms, evident in the fossil record, is a consequence of the unrelenting competition for survival that propels evolution. It was accompanied by the emergence of nervous systems and the first inkling of sentience. The continuing complexification of brains, to use Teilhard de Chardin's term, enhanced consciousness until self-consciousness emerged: awareness reflecting upon itself. This recursive process started millions of years ago in some of the more highly developed mammals. In Homo sapiens, it has achieved its temporary pinnacle. But complexification does not stop with individual self-awareness. It is ongoing and, indeed, speeding up. In today's technologically sophisticated and intertwined societies, complexification is taking on a supraindividual, continent-spanning character. With the instant, worldwide communication afforded by cell phones, e-mail, and social networking, I foresee a time when humanity's teeming billions and their computers will be interconnected in a vast matrix — a planetary Übermind. Provided mankind avoids Nightfall — a thermonuclear Armageddon or a complete environmental meltdown — there is no reason why this web of hypertrophied consciousness cannot spread to the planets and, ultimately, beyond the stellar night to the galaxy at large.
The rest of Consciousness traces Koch's groundbreaking work with physical chemist Francis Crick (who, along with james Watson, discovered the double-helix structure of DNA) and explores how science has attempted to reconcile the hard physicality of the brain, the most complex object in the known universe, with the intangible world of awareness, populated by our senses, our emotions, and our very experience of life.
Tan Zhongyi became the new Women's World Champion after defeating Anna Muzychuk in tiebreaks. The 25-year-old has kept the title in China, after showing good technique and an astounding competitive spirit. Tan Zhongyi played no less than 34 games, and overcame a number of highly tense encounters.
After a draw in Game 4, the Women's World Chess Championship final — just like the World Championship in New York — was decided in tiebreaks. A priori, Anna Muzychuk was the favorite given the fact that she obtained an impressive double gold in last year's Rapid and Blitz World Championships in Qatar. The Ukrainian had White in the first 25-minute game.
The Chinese used the Petroff Defense and, curiously, until move 14 followed a game played by Anna Muzychuk against her sister. That game ended in a peaceful draw in a little over 30 moves, but this one would be different!
Against her sister Mariya, Anna chose the quiet 14.Qc3, with the idea of exchanging queens after Qb3. In Tehran, however, she showed her great preparation and improved with 14.f3!, followed by an increase on Black's center with Qe2, Bd2-c3. White got a better position, and after centralizing her queen, we arrived to one of the key positions of the game.
The natural 19.g4, avoiding Bf5 and preparing h4-h5, would create a lot of problems on Black's kingside. Probably Tan Zhongyi would eventually find herself forced to play Qc6, exchanging queens but weakening her structure, although Muzychuk always had Qe2 to keep her strongest attacking piece. Black's position would be very hard to defend! However, Anna decided to take on b7, which made the Chinese's task much easier. Nonetheless, White kept some pressure and maintained her advantage, which takes us to the most relevant moment of the game.
It's clear who has managed to keep the upper hand — Black is in serious trouble on the queenside! Anna could have played 38.a5 followed by Ra7, and there's no way to save the pawn or find much counterplay with Black. With the clock ticking, though, Muzychuk chose the wrong plan (38.Be3) and gave some tempi to her opponent, who created counterplay on the kingside and managed to draw the game. As a curiosity, it's worth pointing out that 38.Bd4?? would run into a rather artistic mate after 38...Be1#.
In the second game, Anna Muzychuk had no trouble to equalize with Black and, despite the fact that White had the bishop pair, her position seemed preferable.
Black can play the precise 19...Bxc5! forcing White to take with the pawn and stopping her initiative on the queenside. After this, she could have created problems on the other side of the board with g5-h5, while keeping a strong center with the knights — eventually White could place the queen on e6 and a rook on the d-file. Instead, Anna allowed her opponent to take on e4 with the knight and to advance on the queenside with b5. The position became quite dangerous!
The White pieces are better positioned, so Anna rightfully felt she needed to abandon a passive defense and played 31...Qb4!, sacrificing the a7-pawn in exchange of activity. The Chinese reacted correctly to the threats, maneuvered, and — after exchanging the a2-pawn for the e4-pawn — they arrived at a position that Muzychuk will hardly forget...
After the natural 39...Kg8 the game would go on, as White´s extra pawn might not be so important if Tan Zhongyi doesn't find a way to stop the very dangerous passed b-pawn. Despite the fact that the cold-blooded computer evaluates the position as favorable for White, there was still a lot of action on the board, with all three results possible. Muzychuk might have thought that White's d-pawn could become a queen and, to avoid a hypothetical check with d8Q+, she made the biggest mistake of the event: 39...Kh6?? The king is too exposed and the Chinese took her chance immediately with 40.g4!, threatening g5 and winning the game. It was an unexpected ending, which gave Tan Zhongyi the World Championship crown!
So the Women's World Championship is over. The event was marked by a controversial start, when a lot of players decided not to participate due to political reasons — Hou Yifan did not participate for other reasons. These absences lowered the popularity of the event in comparison to previous editions. However, we cannot but congratulate Tan Zhongyi, who showed nerves of steel to become the new Women's World Champion!

Luxor Las Vegas is a 30-story hotel and casino situated on the southern end of the Las Vegas Strip in Paradise, Nevada. The hotel is owned and operated by MGM Resorts International and has a 120,000-square-foot (11,000 m2) casino with over 2,000 slot machines and 87 table games.[1][2]
After the 2008–2009 renovation work, the hotel's management modernized the property in its design to contain a total of 4,407 rooms (including 442 suites). The hotel's rooms line the interior walls of the main tower, which has a pyramid shape, and other recent 22-story twin ziggurat towers.[2][3][4]
The hotel is named for the city of Luxor (ancient Thebes) in Egypt.[5]
As of 2010, the Luxor was designated as a 4 Key rating from the Green Key Eco-Rating Program, which evaluates what is known as "sustainable hotel operations."[6] The hotel features inclined elevators.
History [ edit ]
View of the pyramid also showing the east ziggurat tower
Groundbreaking for the Luxor occurred in March 1992 and the resort officially opened at 4 AM on October 15, 1993, to a crowd of 10,000 people.[7][8][9] When it opened, the pyramid, which cost $375 million to build, was the tallest building on the strip and contained 2,526 rooms and a 100,000 sq ft (9,300 m2) casino.[3][10][11] The resort was financed by “petty cash” earned from other Circus Circus Enterprises properties and did not include any outside financial investors.[7] The hotel's pyramid is similar in size to the Red Pyramid and Bent Pyramid of Egypt.
A theater and two additional towers totaling 2,000 rooms were added in 1998 for $675 million.[3] When the resort opened, it featured the Nile River Tour which was a river ride that carried guests to different parts of the pyramid and passed by pieces of ancient artwork on a river that encircled the casino.[12] The casino also featured King Tut's Tomb and Museum, a duplicate of King Tutankhamen's tomb as found in the Valley of the Kings near Luxor, Egypt.[7]
On May 7, 2007, a vehicle exploded in a Luxor Hotel parking garage due to a homemade pipe bomb which left one dead.[13] Local authorities believe the victim, a 24-year-old employee at Nathan's Famous hot dog restaurant in the Luxor food court, was the intended target. The hotel was not evacuated, operations continued uninterrupted, and the parking structure as well as the casino were undamaged.[14][15] Two men were found guilty of the bombing, and in 2010 were sentenced to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole.
In July 2007, owner MGM Resorts International announced plans to thoroughly renovate the Luxor, spending $300 million to remodel 80% of Luxor's public areas, removing much of the ancient Egyptian theme and replacing it with more adult-oriented and modern lounges, restaurants and clubs.[16]
Amenities [ edit ]
Facilities [ edit ]
Luxor Las Vegas includes 20,000 sq ft (1,900 m2) of convention space, four swimming pools and whirlpools, a wedding chapel, Nurture Spa and Salon, and 29 retail stores.[18][19][20][21]
Shows [ edit ]
The Luxor is home to two shows which consist of "Fantasy" (a topless revue), and comedian Carrot Top.[22] The hotel also began hosting in 2009 “Bodies: The Exhibition,” an educational display on the human body, and “Titanic: The Artifact Exhibition” replacing their three-story arcade.[23][24] From 2000 to 2005, the Luxor Theatre was the home of the performance-art show Blue Man Group, which then moved to the Venetian Las Vegas.[25] Blue Man Group returned to the Luxor Theatre starting November 18, 2015.
Inside the pyramid was an IMAX-Cinema, operating from 1996 to 2008.[26] At time of the opening it was one out of 20 IMAX screens.
Clubs [ edit ]
On August 31, 2007, LAX Nightclub officially opened at a party hosted by Britney Spears.[27] A number of other celebrities, including Christina Aguilera, have also hosted events at the club.[28] The two-level, 26,000 sq ft (2,400 m2) venue contains 78 VIP tables and Noir Bar, which according to the Las Vegas Review Journal is an “ultra-elite bar” with a reservations-only policy. LAX Nightclub was closed on April 1, 2017 and was transformed into an eSports venue, eSports Arena Las Vegas.[27] Work on the eSports Arena began in July 2017 and completed in March 2018. Additional nightlife destinations within Luxor include CatHouse, Aurora, Liquidity, and Flight.[29][30]
The Atrium [ edit ]
Luxor Las Vegas has the largest atrium in the world (by volume) at 29 million cubic feet (820,000 m3).
Luxor Sky Beam [ edit ]
The light of the Luxor low view
At 42.3 billion candela, the Luxor Sky Beam is the strongest beam of light in the world, using curved mirrors to collect the light from 39 xenon lamps and focus them into one intense, narrow beam. On a clear night, the Sky Beam is visible up to 275 miles (443 km) away by aircraft at cruising altitude, such as over Los Angeles.[31][32]
Each of the 39 lamps is a 7,000 watt[33] Xenotech fixture[34] costing about $1,200. When at full power, the system costs $51 an hour to operate, with $20 per hour of that just for its 315,000 watts of electricity.[33] The beam has operated reliably since first enabled on October 15, 1993.[31]
The lamp room is about 50 feet (15 m) below the top of the building and serviced by a staff of two workers during the day.[35] The room's temperature is about 300 °F (150 °C) while the lights are operating.[36] Since 2008, only half the lamps are lit as a cost and energy saving measure.[37]
Location [ edit ]
Luxor is located on the southern end of the Las Vegas Strip.[38] The resort is flanked by the Mandalay Bay to the south and by the Excalibur to the north; all three are connected by free express and local trams,[39] as well as by walkways, with The Shoppes of Mandalay Bay, a boutique shopping centre built on a bridge over Mandalay Bay Road, directly connecting the Luxor with the Mandalay Bay resort to the south. All three properties were built by Circus Circus Enterprises, which in 1999 became Mandalay Resort Group, which was then succeeded by MGM Mirage in April 2005 (now named MGM Resorts International).[40][41]
Usage in popular culture [ edit ]
This destination hotel is often viewed as a prime example of 1990s Postmodern architecture, and appeared on the cover of architecture scholar James Steele's book Architecture Today.[42] Since opening in 1993, the hotel has appeared in numerous films including the 1996 film Mars Attacks![43] and the film 2012.[44]
In Up in the Air, George Clooney's character, Ryan Bingham, is asked to take a picture in front of the Luxor hotel. The Hotel was also seen in the movie The Hangover.[45] The hotel has also been featured in the television shows Fear Factor, Criss Angel Mindfreak, Great Hotels, and CSI.[43][46] A replica of the Luxor, named "The Camel's Toe", appeared in the Las Venturas area of the video game Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas, and another replica appeared in the Las Vegas area of the 2000 video game Driver 2.[47] The Luxor Las Vegas also appears in Futurama episode, "Viva Mars Vegas". It also appears in Vegas Vacation starring Chevy Chase. Tupac Shakur also stayed in The Luxor in September 1996 when he was gunned down on the strip after a Mike Tyson-Bruce Seldon fight on September 7, 1996.

Germany to Silence Diverse Opinions by Holding Social Media to Ransom: Merkel, GDR, and Sharia
Helmut Joachim Schmidt, Amina Qamar, and Lee Jay Walker
Modern Tokyo Times
The mirror of the German Democratic Republic (GDR) is becoming a new politically correct reality under Chancellor Merkel of Germany. In other words, the manipulation of the media, not focusing on sensitive areas that may highlight non-German race crimes, crushing the freedom of individuals who oppose mass immigration, and other important areas, will now find boundless freedoms crushed by a so-called democratic state. Hence, social media companies will face hefty economic fines if they don't comply with “a spying state.”
It waits to be seen, for example, if Germany will prevent individuals from espousing Sharia Islamic law. If not, then something is clearly amiss. After all, under Merkel, she believes that wealthy Gulf nations and Iran should get a free ride when it comes to mass Muslim immigration. After all, she opened up Germany to all and sundry without thinking about any negative consequences – from terrorism, destabilizing social cohesion, crime, rape attacks, and mass sexual crimes by migrants against women in Germany that have occurred.
Therefore, with Salafi Islam growing in Germany and some mosques espousing Sharia Islamic law, then why is this tolerated? After all, Sharia Islamic law supports killing apostates, stoning women to death for adultery, believes in killing homosexuals, espouses that women and non-Muslims are unequal in law to Muslim men, and other negative realities. Given this reality, if nationalists become victimized by an increasingly draconian German state, but people supporting Sharia Islamic law get away scot-free, then obviously the new legal framework is aimed at protecting a religious legal system that openly supports hate towards “the other.”
In a past article by Modern Tokyo Times, it was stated, “German people who just seek a society based on preserving the dominant culture is being ignored by so-called elites who have a multicultural, multi-religious, and cheap labor agenda. Of course, in the eyes of Merkel and the politically correct media, normal Germans who don't follow the party line are deemed racist and xenophobic. Therefore, the terminology of the “far right” is used at all occasions in order to crush genuine debate and to engineer a new Germany based on the ashes of indigenous culture.”
It is increasingly clear that social media is providing a voice internationally based on an array of issues. Of course, some issues will be deemed negative but the idea of social media is based on freedom. Yes, certain limitations are required to protect people from violence, for example, if groups or individuals entice people to terrorism, to kill or maim innocent individuals based on ethnicity or religion, gender hatred aimed at the LGBT community, and so forth. However, new laws in Germany are erroneously more draconian and is aimed at protecting the politically correct agenda. After all, some areas that espouse hatred have been free to incite and indoctrinate – hence, many Sunni Islamist Takfiris from Germany have gone to Syria to kill Alawites, Christians, and Shia Muslims. Therefore, hefty economic fines on social media companies including Facebook, Google, and Twitter, are all aimed at installing the politically correct agenda – while tolerating the most intolerable beliefs based on Sunni Salafi Takfiri Islam that equally hates non-Muslims and Shia Muslims alike.
The New York Times says, “Technology companies and free speech advocates argue that there is a fine line between policymakers' views on hate speech and what is considered legitimate freedom of expression, and social networks say they do not want to be forced to censor those who use their services. Silicon Valley companies also deny that they are failing to meet countries' demands to remove suspected hate speech online.”
In an earlier article by Modern Tokyo Times it was stated, “Merkel, the state apparatus, and a largely compliant elite media campaign are working hand-in-hand with manipulating facts on the ground, while also deeming all opponents of mass migration with being far-right, racist, narrow-minded bigots and so forth. Not content with this, the new Merkel GDR mirror is now allowing intelligence agencies to spy on German nationals if they happen to be deemed politically suspicious. In other words, so-called democratic Germany that tolerates radical Salafists spreading hatred is now intent on intimidating individuals who happen to oppose the Merkel mass migration diktat.”
If the far-right, far-left, and individuals that propagate Sharia Islamic law aren't tackled equally, then clearly a new GDR mirror based on the politically correct agenda of Merkel – and other political elites – is being tolerated. Equally alarming, this is based on targeting certain groups and individuals who don't support the mass immigration political diktat. At the same time, the dangerous religious dogma of Sunni Takfiri Islamism is escaping the same scrutiny – this dogma hates non-Muslims, the Shia, Alawites, Alevis, and others, in equal measure.

Should We Just Follow Orders? Rules of Engagement for Resisting the Police State
Should We Just Follow Orders? Rules of Engagement for Resisting the Police State
By John W. Whitehead
October 07, 2014
“Let your motto be resistance! resistance! Resistance! No oppressed people have ever secured their liberty without resistance.”—Abolitionist Henry Highland Garnet
The perils of resisting the police state grow more costly with each passing day, especially if you hope to escape with your life and property intact. The thing you must remember is that we've entered an age of militarized police in which we're no longer viewed as civilians but as enemy combatants.
Take, for example, Mary Elizabeth VandenBerg who was charged with disturbing the peace, a crime punishable by up to 93 days in jail and a $500 fine, for daring to vocalize her frustrations over a traffic ticket by reading a prepared statement to the court clerk and paying her $145 traffic ticket with 145 one-dollar bills. VandenBerg was also handcuffed, tasered and pepper sprayed for “passively” resisting police by repeatedly stopping and talking to them and stiffening her arms. The incident, filmed by VandenBerg's brother, is now the subject of a lawsuit.
Zachary Noel was tasered by police and charged with resisting arrest after he questioned why he was being ordered out of his truck during a traffic stop. “Because I'm telling you to,” the officer replied before repeating his order for Noel to get out of the vehicle and then, without warning, shooting him with a taser through the open window. The encounter, recorded with a cell phone by Noel's friend in the passenger seat, offers a particularly chilling affirmation of how little recourse Americans really have when it comes to obeying an order from a government official or police officer, even if it's just to ask a question or assert one's rights.
Eighteen-year-old Keivon Young was shot seven times by police from behind while urinating outdoors. Young was just zipping up his pants when he heard a commotion behind him and then found himself struck by a hail of bullets from two undercover cops. Despite the fact that the officers mistook Young—5'4,” 135 lbs., and guilty of nothing more than taking a leak outdoors—for a 6' tall, 200 lb. murder suspect whom they later apprehended, the young man was charged with felony resisting arrest and two counts of assaulting a peace officer.
What these incidents make clear is that anything short of compliance will now get you charged with any of the growing number of contempt charges (ranging from resisting arrest and interference to disorderly conduct, obstruction, and failure to obey a police order) that get trotted out anytime a citizen voices discontent with the government or challenges or even questions the authority of the powers that be—and that's the best case scenario. The worst case scenario involves getting probed, poked, pinched, tasered, tackled, searched, seized, stripped, manhandled, arrested, shot, or killed.
So what can you really do when you find yourself at the mercy of law enforcement officers who have almost absolute discretion to decide who is a threat, what constitutes resistance, and how harshly they can deal with the citizens they were appointed to “serve and protect”? In other words, what are the rules of engagement when it comes to interacting with the police?
If you want to play it safe, comply and do whatever a police officer tells you to do. Don't talk back. Don't threaten. And don't walk away. In other words, don't do anything that even hints at resistance.
Keep in mind, however, that this is not a fail-safe plan, especially not in an age where police officers tend to shoot first and ask questions later, oftentimes based only on their highly subjective “feeling” of being threatened, and are reprimanded with little more than a slap on the wrist. Indeed, the news is riddled with reports of individuals who didn't resist when confronted by police and still got tasered, tackled or shot simply because they looked at police in a threatening manner or moved in a way that made an officer fear for his safety.
For example, Levar Edward Jones was shot by a South Carolina police officer during a routine traffic stop over a seatbelt violation as he was in the process of reaching for his license and registration. The trooper justified his shooting of the unarmed man by insisting that Jones reached for his license “aggressively.”
If compliance isn't quite your cup of tea—and we'd be far better off as a nation if we were far less compliant—then you've got a few more options ranging from legal-but-sure-to-annoy-an-officer to legal-but-it-could-get-you-arrested to legal-but-it-could-get-you-shot.
If this is war—and a good case could be made for the fact that the government is indeed waging a war on the American citizenry—then the tactics I'm about to outline could be considered nonviolent guerilla warfare, using whatever strategic, legal, creative and nonviolent means are available in order to outmaneuver an opponent—in our case, the American police force—whose language is the language of force.
To begin with, and most importantly, Americans need to know their rights when it comes to interactions with the police, bearing in mind that many law enforcement officials are largely ignorant of the law themselves. In a nutshell, here are your basic rights when it comes to interactions with the police as outlined in the first ten amendments to the U.S. Constitution:
You have the right under the First Amendment to ask questions and express yourself. You have the right under the Fourth Amendment to not have your person or your property searched by police or any government agent unless they have a search warrant authorizing them to do so. You have the right under the Fifth Amendment to remain silent and not incriminate yourself.
You have the right under the Sixth Amendment to request an attorney. Depending on which state you live in and whether your encounter with police is consensual as opposed to your being temporarily detained or arrested, you may have the right to refuse to identify yourself. Presently, 26 states do not require citizens to show their ID to an officer (drivers in all states must do so, however).
Knowing your rights is only part of the battle, unfortunately. The hard part comes in when you have to exercise those rights in order to hold government officials accountable to respecting those rights.
As a rule of thumb, you should always be sure to clarify in any police encounter whether or not you are being detained, i.e., whether you have the right to walk away. That holds true whether it's a casual “show your ID” request on a boardwalk, a stop-and-frisk search on a city street, or a traffic stop for speeding or just to check your insurance.
As I point out in my book A Government of Wolves: The Emerging American Police State, if you feel like you can't walk away from a police encounter of your own volition—and more often than not you can't, especially when you're being confronted by someone armed to the hilt with all manner of militarized weaponry and gear—then for all intents and purposes, you're essentially under arrest from the moment a cop stops you.
Still, it doesn't hurt to clarify that distinction, as Kahler Nygard learned. Nygard was threatened with arrest for failing to comply with an order by TSA agents to undergo additional screening after flying with no incident from Minneapolis to his final destination in Denver. It turns out that Nygard, at one time a vocal critic of the government, had been placed on a special list requiring him to undergo extra airport screening. When airport officials realized that they had failed to carry out the additional screening prior to Nygard's departure, they attempted to cover their mistake by screening him once he landed. To the annoyance of the government agent, Nygard—who filmed the entire encounter—repeatedly asked the agent whether he was being detained or not. Once he deduced that the TSA had no legal rationale for detaining him, Nygard walked away without incident. The encounter might have ended far differently had a police officer been standing nearby, however.
Another important takeaway from Nygard's experience is to record your encounter with police. While technology is always going to be a double-edged sword, with the gadgets that are the most useful to us in our daily lives—GPS devices, cell phones, the internet—being the very tools used by the government to track us, monitor our activities, and generally spy on us, cell phones are particularly useful for recording encounters with the police and have proven to be increasingly powerful reminders to police that they are not all powerful.
No matter what individual police officers might say to the contrary, members of the public have a First Amendment right to record police interactions, as the Justice Department recognized in a 2012 memorandum acknowledging that “recording governmental officers engaged in public duties is a form of speech through which private individuals may gather and disseminate information of public concern, including the conduct of law enforcement officers.”
That said, there may still be consequences for filming the police, as Fred Marlow learned the hard way. Marlow was charged with interfering and resisting arrest, and fined $5,000 for daring to film a SWAT team raid that took place across the street from his apartment. Marlow was asleep when he heard what sounded like “multiple bombs blasting and glass breaking.” Rushing outside to investigate, Marlow filmed police officers dressed in army green camouflage standing beside an armored vehicle, in the process of carrying out a SWAT team raid to serve a search warrant (more than 80,000 such raids take place every year in the U.S. for such routine police procedures as serving search warrants). Ordered to return inside or face arrest for interference, Marlow explained that he was on his own property and could be outside. He was subsequently arrested.
One popular alternative to citizens filming police encounters is having the police wear body cameras, which have been proven to decrease the number of use-of-force incidents and citizen complaints when used properly. Unfortunately, given that they can be turned off as easily as they are turned on, these devices are also ripe for abuse, not to mention the fact that they are privacy-threatening, roving extensions of the surveillance state whose cameras are conveniently pointed at us, not them.
Clearly, the language of freedom is no longer the common tongue spoken by the citizenry and their government. With the government having shifted into a language of force, “we the people” have been reduced to suspects in a surveillance state, criminals in a police state, and enemy combatants in a military empire.
In such an environment, as every resistor from Martin Luther King Jr. and on down the line has learned, there is always a price to be paid for challenging the status quo. Then again, the price for not challenging the status quo is even worse: outright tyranny, the loss of our freedoms, and a totalitarian regime the likes of which the world has never seen before.

Getting Started on a New Classic
Here we go again. A nice flamed piece of maple rough cut on the bandsaw and a nice one peice alder body. It has no knots and a very nice light weight. The customer picked sonic blue (most excellent).
I forgot to take pictures of the routing process but it's hard to move the router and take pictures. Then I route the back cavity first, then put the front template on and do the front. I use a 5\8 inch pattern a bit with a bearing to copy the template. I use a 1/2 diameter pattern a bit for the tighter corners. Then I test and tweak the neck pocket fit with chisels, sand paper and putty.
I sand the body contours on the belt sander and then test fit the pickguard, pickups, bridge, and jack plate. Then I test the tuner fit. The tuners are hard to do right because there is a lot of precision involved. You can find plenty of examples bad lutherie on all kinds of headstocks. This one came out great luckily.
Working on the Neck
You can see where I made notes on the template to help remember how drill the holes accurately. There is also some pink bondo on there from redrilling a pilot hole. Again they have to be perfect. You can also see a shot of my truss rod channel jig. You can kind of see the curve transferred from the neck blueprint. The router stays straight because it's a tight fit from left to right.
The fretboard is clamped down to drill the truss rod hole. The size of this hole needs to be perfect because you want a good fit. On vintage models the nut went into the rosewood slightly
The truss rod channel is slid through the hole at the end. it can be tough to knock it through the hole at the heel. The anchor at the headstock is installed in a slot cut to the exact size of the anchor. The body is sanded, sprayed with sealer, and sanded again to 150 grit. You can see the nails in the front so the guitar can be sprayed the pre-CBS way.
A maple stunk stripe is installed and glued in with hide glue and tons of clamps. I use a chisel to cut it flush. Sometimes i just run it through the planer if the metal anchor is deep enough. Then the fretboard was glued on with hide glue and thousands of PSI of pressure. The glue squeeze out is cleaned up
I was unhappy with my last iteration of the neck shaping jig so I improved on it. You can see the initial base being built. It needs to move smoothly. I also had to route very accurate 1/2 inch channels on the ends for the rod. I ended up using bungie cord and gate clamps instead of springs. It is a little more adjustable.
Catlanta is all around you.
Neck jig is operational. You can see the curved pucks that dictate the neck shape. It took tons of research and math and sketchup drawing to get this thing working well. I still have a few improvements to make. Mainly in the dust collection department, as well as making more pucks for different shapes.
I ran tons of 2×4 practice necks through the jig before it started cutting correctly. Getting an accurate centerline and lining it up with the jig is pretty critical. The actual neck was run through it and it was nearly perfect. It leaves a lot of tooling lines in the neck which are sanded out. I am still experimenting with different bits to see which will give me the smoothest cut.
I use a rasp to shape the headstock and heel transitions. This may be my favorite part of every build.
I thinned the headstock to the correct thickness. I like to cut it with the bandsaw first then sand it.
The headstock nut transition is sanded using the robo sander on the drill press. It has a gentle curve to it which is pretty fun to shape. It goes pretty quick with 36 grit paper on the drum. I filled the template holes with a mix of maple dust and titebond glue.
I cut the frets on a jig from stew mac with a japanese fret saw. The jig has an indexing pin for the stew mac fret ruler. But I have the ruler that does not have slots in it, so I removed the pin and built a sled with my ruler attached to it. Then I don't have to worry about getting slots perpendicular to the center line. My only concern is getting the slots in the right place, and the right depth.
Then I glue in the nut with hide glue and tons of pressure. I drill fret dots and glue in clay dots with superglue.
The body got a second sanding sealer coat. I sanded the first coat almost completely off. Then I sprayed the second coat, and sanded dull. You use the shiny spots to locate any small dips, dings, or scratches. Then I installed the side dots, and mask the fretboard. I do spray lacquer on the side rosewood.
Sonic Blue
Lacquer really brings out the light flame in the maple. Its just beautiful, but not too overstated to distract from the classic qualities of the guitar. I mixed up some sonic blue using old automotive paint catalogs to get a good match. It's hard to say what this color really looked like in the 50s, but this should be very close. I use automotive lacquer as a base just like the Pre-CBS days. They don't make duco lacquer anymore but this stuff should be very similar.
I just love the figure on the back of the neck.
A shot of the brownish lacquer in the spray gun. It is brown because it sat in my driveway in the sun for almost a year. It is still pretty clear when applied. If shot over stark white it gives a cream color.
You can see the final tint after building up some coats on the neck.
I installed the waterslide decal. They don't want to adhere properly unless you do it just right. It seems like it needs to sit in water for no more than 30 seconds. Once you install it you don't want to move it around at all. Around the 10 day mark, I send the customer photos of some different pickguards so he can pick one out. He went with parchment.
I start working on the pickups and electronics since the guitar is nearly ready for the buffer. The pickup bobbin was assembled with the spacers that made sure it's stayed square. Then I dip the frame in lacquer before winding. After winding I check the resistance with a multimeter. I was shooting for 6k. Pretty dang close. Each pickup got 7600 turns of wire.
Then I install the pickguard switch, potentiometers, and pickups. I temporarily install the input jack and plug in to the amp> I use a tuning fork to check the electronics before installing into the guitar. Then I buffed out the neck and body.
Final Assembly
I love how it turned out. Then I carefully install the tuners and ferrules. I wax the tuner screws so they don't break off in the hard maple. If you don't do this correctly they will easily break. I use tape on the bit to make sure it does not go too deep while installing tuner screws.
I installed the front hardware. Then I cut and file the nut for the strings to a depth of .071 inch using feeler gauges from autozone. I use a string spacing rule from stewmac.com to space the string gaps. I measure 1/8th inch from the sides of the nut and space evenly from there.
I weigh the guitar and it's a very light 7lbs 7.2oz. I can go lighter by hogging out holes under the pickguard with a forstner bit on heavier bodies, or for a customer who needs a featherweight instrument.
And that's it. Thanks for reading.

The title of John Pilger's new film reminded me of a now-forgotten conservative tract from 1991, The Coming War With Japan by George Friedman and Meredith Lebard, a hawkish work which argued that the Soviet collapse meant America should be on its guard against the resurgent old enemy from the second world war. Paradoxically, Pilger's documentary is about paranoia and pre-emptive military belligerence in the Pacific: a 21st century alt-yellow-peril. It's a subject which tends to be ignored, especially now that we are (justifiably) concerned by Putin's Russia.
Facebook Twitter Pinterest Watch the trailer for The Coming War on China
Pilger politely reminds us that Nobel peace laureate Barack Obama presided over a massive increase in nuclear spending and a new strategic objective, the super-modern “pivot to Asia”, which for the arms business is like the exploitation of a lucrative new market. It means a colossal but unacknowledged buildup of military bases under China's nose, specifically intended to smack down any thoughts China might be having about translating its commercial prosperity into power in the region and answer with an overwhelming show of strength China's own disputed claim to the Spratly Islands in the South China Sea. Their semi-secret bases are tracked by academic David Vine in his observation project Base Nation. Pilger fills in the historical context: from turning the Marshall Islands and their peoples into vivisectional nuclear-test guinea pigs after the war, the US government has turned many places into missile bases whose weapons are trained on China. (Pilger could – but doesn't – point out how close America came to a nuclear strike on China during the Korean war.)
It's a bizarre, dysfunctional situation, a buildup which shows no sign of abating, certainly now that Donald Trump has encouraged America to believe China is its new enemy. This is a gripping film, which though it comes close to excusing China (“Yes, there are issues with human rights …”) does point out China's insecurities and political cruelties. A strong corrective to our bland and complacent indifference to the new war-game scenario in the Pacific.

The dumpster fire in the Oval Office now demands liberal Americans and the Trump supporters who regret their vote to be more vigilant and politically active. And Trump voters, if you don't regret your vote yet, you will. Probably the day you discover Benjamin Franklin's face on the hundred has been replaced with Yakov Smirnoff's.
And lots of Americans have answered the call. People now regularly call their congressmen – and not just to yell Baba-Booey. Citizens make signs, go to demonstrations, watch more news, read more analysis, and engage in social media activism.
In these extraordinary times, it's imperative that all branches of the opposition remain vigilant ― including the media. However, there's one group of reporters in particular who've taken their eye off the ball.
I'm talking about the White House press corp.
Five days a week, Sean Spicer holds a press conference. And just like sex, women think it lasts two minutes. Guys think it so totally can go all night. It is, in fact, the only guaranteed one hour each day for the press to demand answers and to rub disinfectant on the open sore that is the Trump White House.
What I wanted to know is, are Americans getting 100% of the White House press corps' attention, focus, and energy during those daily press conferences?
To find out, I watched 10 hours of Sean Spicer press conferences from days in both February and March. And yes, my retinas do fucking burn, but my team of doctors, scientists and eyebrow stylists say it should clear up in 4 to 8 years.
So, I made a BIGLY discovery watching these press conferences: Waaaay too many White House reporters aren't paying attention to their colleagues' questions or the press secretary's answers… because they are on their goddamned fucking phones.
Christ. Even people at the movies know to turn off their phones… even for the trailers… even if it's a trailer for ‘Fast and The Furious 10' because they know it's a distraction. And if the phone can distract you from understanding that movie's plot ― “Cars go fast… zoom, zoom, zoom… Explosion. Explosion. Gratuitous boob shot. Gratuitous ass shot. Explosion. The end.” ― Imagine how distracting the phone is when your job is to listen to the mouthpiece for the president as he very quickly tries to sneak by you that border patrol agents carrying AK-47s are going to break down your door and drag your 70-something Guatemalan nanny back to the Mexico border, or how your grandma is gonna need a casket lickety-split because now she has to choose between her Werther's butterscotch drops and her diabetes medicine.
In these extraordinary times, it's imperative that all branches of the opposition remain vigilant ― including the media.
Here are the facts: Study after scientific study has confirmed with 100% absolute certainty that cell phone usage distracts from whatever else you're doing. Three-thousand drivers distracted by their phone die every year while driving on U.S. highways.
In 2014, Time Magazine reported that “just having it visible nearby may distract you from complex tasks,” adding:
“... your focus is not on the task at hand, whether it be trying to write an article, get this spreadsheet set up, or just socializing; your mind is elsewhere.”
And I didn't just see reporters on their phone a few times, some of them are on their phone nearly every time the camera cuts to them (see video below).
One reporter, in particular, was on her phone the most: CBS's White House correspondent, Margaret Brennan (see video below).
In fact, nearly the only time Brennan wasn't on her phone was when she was asking Sean Spicer a question. However, the minute she got her answer ― and I swear this is real ― she was back on her phone.
And what was she doing? Well, some of the time, she was on Twitter. On March 10th, the White House Press briefing was held from 10:45 till 11:45. And, she was live tweeting. Only, here's the thing: The White House briefing room is not The People's Choice Awards. She's the White House correspondent for CBS News trying to determine if Russia hacked the U.S. election. Seems like you'd have to pay attention… She's not Ryan Seacrest trying to determine what the fuck Bjork is wearing (see video below).
Margaret Brennan was also re-tweeting other White House correspondents who were also at the press conference. There was a tweet from ABC's Jon Karl, and seconds later it was re-tweeted by Margaret Brennan. If she really wanted to know what Jon Karl was up to, it would have been much easier to lean over and ask him. He was sitting ONE SEAT AWAY!
I've worked in TV for 20 years and there are two things I'm 100% certain of: Americans love to laugh at Kevin James riding a Segway, and, CBS can afford a Twitter intern so their reporters can focus on what's important ― like fact-checking the president's lies ― NOT getting more Twitter followers.
In case I haven't been clear, what Americans need now from the people who cover the White House is 100% of their attention for the one hour where Sean Spicer is trying to defend that which is indefensible.
And here's the other thing: Margaret Brennan isn't entirely to blame. She's been forced into an untenable position. We viewers have short attention spans, we demand information RIGHT. THIS. SECOND. Otherwise, we change channels or click another website. And that's our fault. And we should do better. We say we want information fast but what we really mean is accurate.
Also, I reached out to CBS, CBS News, Margaret Brennan and the White House Correspondent's association. Only the White House Correspondent's Association got back to me; their comment was: “We decline to comment.”
Finally, there were many reporters covering the press conferences that I never saw on their phones.
Somewhere, whoever actually runs the Hawks front office should crack open a beer or make a strong drink and breathe a sigh of relief that Patrick Kane's surgery provides cover today that the Hawks once again missed out on a trade target that would have solved a lot of their problems. And they can sit back and watch as the Kings usurp the era that the Hawks have basically acted that they were entitled to.
It's a story we've had to rehash far too many times the past two years. It's after the parade, a time when perhaps you have to have the most amount of focus to see through the glow and what must be done. Everything looks a little glossier than it actually is and it's easy to make a mistake, the ripples of which will be problems for years.
Bryan Bickell is given four years at $4 million per, which is at best the very top of what he deserved (and that's being as kind as I can be). Granted, the Hawks didn't have anything in the system to replace him (no, it's not Jimmy Hayes though it might have been Kevin. Or possibly Morin, but let's not go over that again). Michal Rozsival is given a two-year extension, even though the Hawks had squeezed out his best hockey and you can always find another plug for cheap.
Now, it's not clear that it was actually Stan who made the decision to re-sign Bickell. That may have come from up above. It may not have. Rozie… don't know.
So we get into last season, and it's clear from early in the season that the Hawks need a center. They get Kris Versteeg. He proceeds to be awful, and ties the Hawks hands at the deadline when they can't upgrade down the middle which is what they need. Ryan Kesler was out there. Didn't get him. Didn't get anyone. They give away a 2nd rounder for David Rundblad.
The summer comes and brings Brad Richards. Not the worst signing, though after Kesler was desperate to come here, kind of letdown. The Hawks didn't have the available prospects the Canucks wanted. Which leads one to wonder, do the Hawks just not have the prospects anyone wants?
Into this year, and those contracts to Bickell and Rozsival cost Nick Leddy, currently the best possession player on the best possession team in the East. That leaves a hole in the defense, when combined with Oduya's decline. Sadly, for the Hawks, the Kings need the same thing. And the Kings get what they want while the Hawks' F.O. stands still.
They told us after '13 that it was time for some kids to bleed through and fill the holes. Well… where are they? Pirri, Hayes, Morin, Stanton, Clendening, Leddy all jettisoned. For what? In the past two years, the only kid to scratch out a spot in the lineup is… Joakim Nordstrom? Ben Smith?
We argue constantly about whether it's the coach who won't play them or they're just not that good. The answer is probably both.
The defense has been the need area all year. Andrej Sekera was the best answer. It cost a 1st and a mid-level prospect. Do the Hawks have none of those? Couldn't match that? This was after last season where Dean Lombardi played his cards right and got Gaborik. That same Gaborik who scored the tying goal in Game 7 while Versteeg, Handzus, and Bollig couldn't get off the bench.
Oh, and Cody Franson was traded in the division, though acquired by a team that already had the best defensive depth in the division. Where were you, Hawks front office?
The Hawks have five days to correct this. They can't get distracted by Kane's injury, because the defense is still the priority. Jeff Petry, Andy Greene, Keith Yandle, at this point I don't fucking care. Because this window is closing. They're going to lose some major pieces in the summer and they're going to have no choice but to fill those holes with kids their coach won't like and who simply might not be ready for primetime.
But what about the past two years convinces you the front office can actually get it right?

Is it time for an AmeriCorps for local news?
The Ford Foundation makes its case in a paper released this week.
“The core economic problem on the local level is stunningly simple: Ad-based business models do not generate enough revenue to pay enough reporters enough money to do enough reporting,” Steven Waldman writes in Report for America.
Waldman, a former adviser to the Federal Communications Commission chairman, presented the paper on Tuesday at Engage Local, a two-day Newark conference hosted by Montclair State University's Center for Cooperative Media.
Conference highlights included a town hall discussion about media coverage of Newark redevelopment, and Washington Post Executive Editor Marty Baron talking about billionaire owner Jeff Bezos, the newspaper's new-media ventures – and its frustrating efforts seeking to free reporter Jason Rezaian from an Iranian prison.
While life as a foreign correspondent is increasingly dangerous, domestic reporting in an era of shrinking newsrooms is becoming ever more difficult and thankless, too, according to Waldman, a former Newsweek reporter.
One career site has ranked “newspaper reporter” as the worst job in America – lumberjacks and prison guards have more desirable gigs.
Yet in-depth, investigative reporting is needed more than ever, Waldman contends. And that's labor-intensive, expensive, and unlikely to generate the mind-boggling web traffic required to generate revenue.
Citing civic service programs such as the Peace Corps, AmeriCorps and Teach for America, Waldman advocates a system of two-year paid fellowships for both young and experienced journalists, who would compete for these positions.
Ideally, he writes, a Report for America national organization would be underwritten by philanthropies, with matching money from local groups or communities that would apply to embed these journalism fellows into their projects.
One hundred reporting slots could be started with under $3 million in seed money; $35 million might launch 1,000 reporters nationwide, Waldman writes.
Over the last three years, he said, “investigative” media projects received $27 million in philanthropic funding – about the same amount contributed toward interactive games.
Some $1.8 billion in philanthropy went to media of all kinds during that period, according to Waldman. The lion's share came from “fortunes created by robber barons of the 19th century [Ford, Rockefeller, Knight], with insufficient involvement from the winners of the digital economy, such as Apple and Google.”
‘A RUNWAY… FOR TAKING OFF, NOT LANDING'
Another digital winner, Amazon.com founder Jeff Bezos, bought the Washington Post for $250 million in 2013.
“Jeff has brought… ideas of his own, opened us to our ideas of what we wanted to do, he's brought a lot of questions about how we do things, and very importantly, he's brought capital, to help us make this transition from a period of print to where we are today,” said Baron, former editor of the Boston Globe.
Bezos made it clear that he had no answers, Baron said, “and that we needed to experiment in a lot of different ways.”
Asserting that the newspaper is on a runway “for taking off, not for landing,” the editor rattled off names of new Post apps and blogs meant to connect with younger, tech-savvy readers. A sportswriter's Periscope live video stream of the newsroom on deadline attracted lots of attention on Twitter.
Public response so far sounds encouraging: Unique visitors to the Post's website are increasing by 65 percent, year to year, and page views are jumping by 100 percent, Baron told interviewer Merrill Brown, founding editor of MSNBC.com and director of Montclair State's communications school.
“We're using every tool available, from Tweets, to embedded videos, to audio, to you name it, every kind of tool that you have now on the web. And you can create new storytelling forms that work extraordinarily well on the web and would be difficult to translate in print,” Baron said.
While he could not predict how mobile media will evolve, he said the Post will adapt and deliver news however people wish to consume it.
The Post also continues trying “every which way to get people involved” in a public relations campaign to win the release of Rezaian, the Tehran correspondent arrested in July 2014 and charged with espionage.
“We're very concerned about his fate, and the fate of his wife, and we continue to protest in every way possible,” Baron said.
‘WHAT DEMOCRACY IS ABOUT'
Public engagement here at home, meanwhile, remains a pressing concern for Morristown's Geraldine R. Dodge Foundation.
The nonprofit, endowed by money from the Rockefeller fortune (Standard Oil) and the Remington Arms Company, supported the conference and is backing several programs pursuing new models of sustainable journalism at the local level.
(Full disclosure: MorristownGreen.com participates in one of those programs, the Local News Lab.)
“We're all struggling, trying to figure out what is the financial model that works here, and how we can make this sustainable. That's our goal at Dodge,” Chris Daggett, the Dodge president, told journalists from independent news sites, newspapers and broadcast stations gathered at the Robert Treat Hotel.
The former gubernatorial candidate and state environmental commissioner pledged to continue this mission as long as he leads the foundation. He said he hopes to attract more funders as well.
“Local journalism is providing a service to people to say: ‘What are your information needs? And how can we best provide responses to those information needs?'
“Because if we do that well, then people get engaged in their communities more and more,” Daggett said. “And that's what … this effort is about, and what democracy is about.”

First, Wisdom should be your highest ability score, followed by Constitution. Second, choose the hermit background. Class Features As a Druid, you gain the following class features: Hit Points Hit Dice: 1d8 per druid level
Hit Points at 1st Level: 8 + your Constitution modifier
Hit Points at Higher Levels: 1d8 (or 5) + your Constitution modifier per druid level after 1st
Proficiencies Armor: Light Armor, Medium Armor, Shields (Druids will not wear armor or use shields made of metal)

Intelligence, Wisdom Skills: Choose two from Arcana, Animal Handling, Insight, Medicine, Nature, Perception, Religion, Survival Equipment You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background: (a) a wooden shield or (b) any one simple weapon
(a) a scimitar (b) any simple melee weapon
Leather armor and a druidic focus
Child of Nature You've spent much of your life out in the wilds, becoming accustomed not only to its beauty but its savagery. While out in the wilderness, you gain the following benefits: You ignore nonmagical difficult terrain
You can always tell which direction is North
Even when you are engaged in another activity while traveling (such as foraging, navigating, or tracking), you remain alert to danger. Spellcasting Drawing on the divine essence of nature itself, you can cast spells to shape that essence to our will. See chapter 10 of the PHB for the general rules of spellcasting and chapter 11 for the druid spell list (remains unchanged). Cantrips At 1st level, you know two cantrips of your choice from the druid spell list. You learn additional druid cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Druid table. Preparing and Casting Spells The Druid table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these druid spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest. You prepare the list of druid spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the druid spell list. When you do so, choose a number of druid spells equal to your Wisdom modifier + your druid level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For example, if you are a 3rd-level druid, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With Wisdom of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell cure wounds, you can cast it using a 1st-level or 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn't remove it from your list of prepared spells. You can also change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of druid spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list. Spellcasting Ability Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your druid spells, since your magic draws upon your devotion and attunement to nature. You use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a druid spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one. Spell save DC = 8 + proficiency bonus + Wisdom mod Spell attack modifier = proficiency bonus + Wisdom mod Ritual Casting You can cast a druid spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell prepared.
Spellcasting Focus You can use a druidic focus (found in chapter 5) as a spellcasting focus for your druid spells. Wild Shape Starting at 2nd level, you can use your action to magically assume the shape of a beast that you have seen before. You can use this feature twice. You regain expended uses when you finish a short or long rest. Your druid level determines the beasts you can transform into, as shown in the Beast Shapes table. Beast Shapes Level Max CR Limitations 2nd 1/2 No Flying or Swimming Speed 4th 1 No Flying Speed 8th Druid Level/4 — Additionally, at 8th level, your attacks in beast form count as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage. You can stay in a beast shape for a number of hours equal to half your druid level (rounded down). You then revert to your normal form unless you expend another use of this feature. You can revert to your normal form earlier by using a bonus action on your turn. You automatically revert if you fall unconscious, drop to 0 hit points, or die. While you are transformed, the following rules apply: Your game statistics are replaced by the statistics of the beast, but you retain your alignment, personality, and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. You also retain all of your skill and saving throw proficiencies, in addition to gaining those of the creature. If the creature has the same proficiency as you and the bonus in its stat block is higher than yours, use the creature's bonus instead of yours. If the creature has any legendary or lair actions, you can't use them.
When you transform, you assume the beast's hit points and Hit Dice. When you revert to your normal form, you return to the number of hit points you had before you transformed. However, if you revert as a result o f dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to your normal form. For example, if you take 10 damage in animal form and have only 1 hit point left, you revert and take 9 damage. As long as the excess damage doesn't reduce your normal form to 0 hit points, you aren't knocked unconscious.
You can't cast spells, and your ability to speak or take any action that requires hands is limited to the capabilities of your beast form. Transforming doesn't break your concentration on a spell you've already cast, however, or prevent you from taking actions that are part of a spell, such as call lightning, that you've already cast.
You retain the benefit of any features from your class, race, or other source and can use them if the new form is physically capable of doing so. However, you can't use any of your special senses, such as darkvision, unless your new form also has that sense.
You choose whether your equipment falls to the ground in your space, merges into your new form, or is worn by it. Worn equipment functions as normal, but the DM decides whether it is practical for the new form to wear a piece of equipment, based on the creature's shape and size. Your equipment doesn't change size or shape to match the new form, and any equipment that the new form can't wear must either fall to the ground or merge with it. Equipment that merges with the form has no effect until you leave the form. Druid Circle At 2nd level, you choose to identify with a circle of druids: the Circle of the Land or the Circle of the Moon, both detailed at the end o f the class description. Your choice grants you features at 2nd level and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th level. Ability Score Improvement When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature. Timeless Body Starting at 18th level, the primal magic that you wield causes you to age more slowly. For every 10 years that pass, your body ages only 1 year. Beast Spells Beginning at 18th level, you can cast many of your druid spells in any shape you assume using Wild Shape. You can perform the somatic and verbal components of a druid spell while in a beast shape, but you aren't able to provide material components. Archdruid At 20th level, you can use your Wild Shape an unlimited number of times. Additionally, you can ignore the verbal and somatic components of your druid spells, as well as any material components that lack a cost and aren't consumed by a spell. You gain this benefit in both your normal shape and your beast shape from Wild Shape. Druid Circles Thought their organization is invisible to most outsiders, druids are part of a society that spans the land, ignoring political borders. All druids are nominally members of this druidic society, though some individuals are so isolated that they have never seen any high-ranking members of the society or participated in druidic gatherings. Druids recognize each other as brothers and sisters. Like creatures of the wilderness, however, druids sometimes compete with or even prey on each other. At a local scale, druids are organized into circles that share certain perspectives on nature, balance, and the way of the druid.
Circle of the Moon Druids of the Circle of the Moon reject the romanticism of nature that most humanoids hold, seeking instead to harness the primal savagery that many creatures must adopt in order to survive in the wild and, on occasion, embrace their inner monster. Changeable as the moon, a druid of this circle might prowl as a great cat one night, soar over the treetops as a griffon the next day, and crash through the undergrowth in bear form to drive off a trespassing monster. The wild is in the druid's blood. Magical Longevity When you choose this circle at 2nd level, you gain the ability to lengthen the time spent in your Wild Shape forms using your magic. Once per use of Wild Shape, you may expend a spell slot to add to the maximum time you can spend in that form equal to 30 minutes per level of spell slot expended this way. Ritual of the Sacred Heart You become capable of expanding your menagerie of Wild Shape forms by becoming intensely familiar with a subject in the wild. Starting at 2nd level, you can potentailly transform into creatures beyond the mundane beasts of the wild. Whenever you kill an Abberation or Monstrosity of a challenge rating less than or equal to one quarter of your druid level rounded down, you may make a DC 16 Wisdom (Survival) check. On a success, you cut out the creature's heart for later use. You can only safely carry one creature's heart at a time. At the beginning of a long rest, if you are in possession of a heart gathered this way, you may perform a one hour ritual, during which you must consume the heart. At the end of the long rest, you permanently add the creature whose heart you have eaten to the possible forms for your Wild Shape ability. Ferocity of the Wild Beginning at 6th level, you can use your Wild Shape ability a number of times per rest equal to your proficiency bonus. Shape of the Dragon Beginning at 10th level, you can expend two uses of your Wild Shape ability to assume the form of a Wyvern. A Thousand Forms By 14th level, you have learned to use magic to alter your physical form in more subtle ways. You can cast the alter self spell at will. Special Thanks to: u/mclemente26

The royal directories called in evidence this week at the Old Bailey phone hacking trial have occasioned much hilarity. The judge, Mr Justice Saunders, caused laughter to break out when he quipped "interesting titles – 'royal pastry'!" as he flicked through one of them. Just for a moment, the lid was lifted on the peculiar royal world.
The job that really caught the court's eye was "warden of the swans", a post held by biologist Christopher Perrins, an emeritus fellow at Wolfson College, Oxford. The warden of the swans works alongside the marker of the swans, David Barber, and together they conduct the annual census of swans on the Thames called swan upping. The Queen owns all the UK's mute swans, but only exercises her right of possession around Windsor.
As they row past Windsor Castle, the swan uppers salute "Her Majesty the Queen, Seigneur of the Swans" in a time-honoured ceremony that Lib Dem MP Norman Baker once dismissed as a feudal throwback. "Swan upping is harmless in itself, but it masks a wider anachronism which is unhealthy and unfair," he complained. What he perhaps didn't know was that the two jobs are relatively recent, dating from 1993 when the 13th-century post of keeper of the Queen's swans was split in two. Who says the royal household doesn't move with the times?
Most of the royal jobs with silly titles are, like the two swan posts, largely honorific. The earl marshal, lord great chamberlain and lord steward have to attend to the sovereign's well-being and look presentable in scarlet; the key qualification for mistress of the robes is not good dress sense but marriage to a duke; the equerries, gentlemen ushers and ladies of the bedchamber are all aristocrats and retired colonels. Only the queen's piper, David Rodgers of the Irish Guards, has to work hard, piping up outside the Queen's door every weekday at 9am and playing for 15 minutes.
If anything, though, the battiness of royal job titles is in decline as the royal household tries to propel itself into the 17th century. Keeper of the lions in the Tower has sadly bitten the dust, as have laundress of the body linen, necessary woman to the corridor, groom of the removing wardrobe, yeoman of the mouth, strewer of herbs, master of cock fighting, chocolate maker to the queen, and all the royal moletakers. At least Norman Baker will be pleased.
We started following him as he led us in a march away from North and Penn and toward the inner harbor. We walked for about forty minutes. When Anthony checked his watch it was 9:30pm. Curfew was at 10pm. We knew getting back to our car by curfew was going to be tough. We were trying to decide whether we were going to stop right then and turn back when an 11-year-old kid walked up to me and asked if I was going to stay out there with him. He said he defied the curfew the night before and had witnessed police officers beating people once the clock struck ten. I asked him how he managed to escape and he said, “You just gotta know how to move.” Then looked at me again and said, “So…are you staying out with me or not?” “Of course I am.” I said. “No way are you gonna outlast me. If you are out here then we are too.” I continued and Anthony readily agreed. The kid looked at all of us and grinned then walked over to Anthony and asked if he could borrow his gas mask. Anthony accommodated him. The kid immediately put it on and kept marching.
Minutes later a CNN correspondent walked over to us and asked me if I was willing to talk to them. I am sure they were captivated by me walking shoulder to shoulder with a kid in a gas mask, but I also think they surveyed the crowd and determined that our crew would be the most “user-friendly.” Maybe I'm projecting but that's how it felt to me. I looked at Anthony for direction and Anthony said, “No. We are not interested” and that was that. CNN's coverage of Baltimore was abysmal and divisive and misleading anyway so that choice was the one with the most integrity, I think.
At ten minutes ‘til 10, riot police started moving in along with helicopters hovering overhead shining bright lights down on all of us. A tank pulled up on our right side essentially pinning us in. We couldn't go back because the riot police were behind us. We couldn't go right because the tank was there. We couldn't reasonably go much more forward because we could see a line of officers already lined up behind their shields ahead. Suddenly there was an announcement over a loud speaker that curfew was imminent and that soon we would be in violation of it. The anxiety from the crowd was palpable. There were some white boys in Guy Fawkes masks rolling around on skateboards flipping cops off, there were others in gas masks trying to advise us, one lanky brother was moving through the crowd telling us to stay together by any means necessary. He was so frenetic it made me nervous. He was telling everyone to calm down but he himself was electric with worry and you could see it in him.
A second announcement came that it was three minutes until curfew and Anthony, Corean, Kamau and I were walking with our arms linked trying to quickly determine which way we were going to go. The lanky brother full of frenzy was passing by people, touching them on the shoulder ands telling them to remain calm. When he got to me he didn't touch my shoulder, offer advice and keep going, but instead, put himself in front of me and put one hand on my breast and the other on my…ahem… baby box, and said “I wanna make sure YOU are safe.” It shocked me. Anthony told him to watch his hands, (I learned later that Anthony did not see that this young man had decided to molest me before the cops jumped on us. He just saw him being too close to me and didn't like it.) I offer that part of the story only because what followed was so traumatizing, I actually forgot I had been molested until much later when we were all safely back at the hotel, debriefing our experience. For me to forget something like that is seismic. It means that what the cops put me through made that act seem insignificant. Oh trauma, you wanton bitch…
When it was 10pm the pepper spray came. Along with sirens and flashing lights and cops running after us with their guns out. People were screaming and fleeing and in my mind there was only one place to go that did not have the apparent presence of police. Down a dark side street to the left, which is where we went. We ran. We ran and felt all of the terror our ancestors must have felt when the slavers came, when the paddy rollers came, when the only thing in your head is NO. YOU WILL NOT TOUCH ME. It was an old feeling. It is a dangerous knowing.
We dipped into the projects. We didn't plan on it. We had no plan except to get the hell away from the same old hands that have been chasing us for centuries. We went where we saw an opening. We found ourselves in a dark courtyard. There was no one around. I saw two chairs in front of someone's apartment and suggested that we sit down in them and pretend to be at home. I figured they were looking for people who were running, people who were scurrying, people who appeared to have no belonging. I pulled one of the chairs out and at that moment, a fair skinned black woman with a stern face opened her door and asked us what was going on. Corean told her that we were running from police officers that meant to harm us; so many people had been harmed already. The woman told Corean to go inside then looked hard at me, Kamau and Anthony. Corean is a petite, baby-faced beauty, but Kamau is a young black man who, in that moment had a wild in his eyes having run from riot police, Anthony is 6'4” and undeniably black and I, myself, am 6 feet tall. The woman looked at each one of us for a moment more and then opened her door wide and said “Go inside. But you be careful coming in my house because I don't know you.” She let us stay there until it was safe to get away.
The kid in the gas mask we were walking with was arrested. Joseph Kent, the dazzling young activist, was arrested by the very officers who were telling him as we were marching that they would NOT do so. I saw a girl who looked to be about 13 years old, clotheslined by a cop as she was running away from riot police. Her head hit the pavement hard. I keep hearing her screams in my head and the terrible smack of her head crashing onto the concrete. Things CNN didn't show you. I saw police officers snatching people off of their porches, their own front porches, and putting them in police wagons because of that ridiculous curfew. I saw it. I never saw the media seek to have the relevant conversations. I never saw them really expose and condemn the officers who kept the media safely behind the caution tape while they pepper sprayed people for exercising their rights as human beings before snatching them down to the ground by their hair and dragging them on their faces. Instead, I saw media talking to protestors about the burned out CVS and the legitimacy of defying the curfew without ever interrogating how criminal it was to issue that curfew in the first place and the way it squeezed and oppressed a community already rocked with appropriate grief and rage.
I should tell you about the “write-in” we went to the next day at a church for high school aged students who were there to talk about what was happening in their city. I should tell you that as well meaning as the organizers were who put the event on, none of them lived in the city. They lived in the suburbs. I should tell you that the kids who were in attendance (about 12 of them) came from private schools and therefore, could not really talk from the inside of things the way 5 year old Meek Meek could. Still, writing is a meditation. It is a balm and a blessing and in that regard what happened in that room was still important.
We went to a barbecue after that being held at the Gilmore Homes where Freddie Gray was arrested. We stood in the exact spot where Freddie was tackled and abused by Baltimore Police where a memorial now announces the birth and death dates of Freddie, spray painted on a brick wall with a halo over Freddie's name. We met the man who videotaped Freddie's arrest on that fateful day, who is a part of a group called Cop Watch. We saw Amy Goodman from Democracy Now interviewing the residents too and we ran into three brothers from Ferguson who had also flown in to offer their support. We saw the residents of the Gilmore Homes with their kids who were fingered painting, playing touch football and rolling around on tricycles. They talked about Freddie and how they saw him everyday. They talked about a place called Mama's that had been set on fire; a fire the police claimed was started by gang members but according to residents, was set by the officers themselves. We heard many stories like that.

It's been almost 27 years since the North American Soccer League last saw a game, but that will change this Saturday when the storied league returns to action under the USSF umbrella with eight franchises.
The NASL was scheduled to begin last April, but a bitter and protracted feud with the United Soccer Leagues, from which the NASL drew a handful of its teams, led to a denial of sanctioning by the USSF and the formation of a temporary USSF Division 2 league. Then, with several clubs facing severe financial difficulties, the league rescinded sanctioning for 2011 before reinstating it in February. The NASL will have to meet certain financial benchmarks in order to retain its sanctioning from the USSF in 2012, but those benchmarks have not been made public.
The league faces an uphill battle for survival, but, for now, the focus is back on the soccer. Eight teams made up of expansion and former USL clubs will participate with the top six teams making the playoffs. Teams will play each other four times for a total of 28 games for each team.
A few small but substantial changes also bring the NASL more in line with a traditional soccer league. Last year, it was not uncommon for a team to play three games in a week, but this year no team can play more than once in a given week. The NASL has also taken its permitted level of substitutes per game down from five to three, in compliance with FIFA guidelines.
Here are SBI's NASL team previews:
Atlanta Silverbacks
How they did last season: Did not play (On hiatus since 2008)
Players to watch: Mexican Mario Perez is a veteran on a team full of youth and inexperience. The 28-year-old fullback is the team's oldest outfield player and will have to develop some leadership skills to get Atlanta through some inevitable hard times. Junior Sandaval from the Puerto Rico Islanders will lead the Silverbacks' attack and former Colorado Rapids' veteran Ciaran O'Brien will anchor the midfield.
Outlook: Unless Atlanta's young players develop at a lightning-quick pace, Atlanta is in for some growing pains. Fans should treat this as an expansion season, where notable progress will be more abundant than results. If the Silverbacks' management can be patient and let the team develop of grow as a unit, this could be a dangerous side down the road, but it's too big of a mountain to climb in 2011.
Carolina Railhawks
How they did last season: 13-9-8, lost in the finals of the USSF Division 2 playoffs.
Players to watch: The cavalcade of newcomers in Carolina is led by veteran Scot Stephen Glass. Glass, now 36, has bounced around the top divisions of British soccer, playing for clubs like Aberdeen and Newcastle along the way. If he can keep fit, Glass can organize Carolina's midfield. Leading the attack is Brazilian Pablo Campos, while former Philadelphia Union goalkeeper Brad Knighton can keep Carolina in games should the defense lapse.
Season outlook: The dissolution of the Railhawks' ownership last season thrust the club's future into serious doubt and led to some wholesale changes on their roster. However, Carolina has done a good job of bringing in some veteran players, and if they can keep off-field distractions out of the locker room, Carolina could be a serious threat.
FC Edmonton
How they did last season: Did not play (expansion)
Players to watch: The inaugural Edmonton roster has a distinctly Canadian flare to it (15 of the 28 registered players hail from the Great White North), but there are few non-Canadian stars to look out for. Dutch midfielder Paul Matthijs, 36, should provide some experience and stability in central midfield, while forward Dan Antoniuk has a history of solid, albeit not spectacular, goal production in the lower leagues of American soccer.
Outlook: Edmonton's roster is full of youth supplemented with a few players who have bounced around the lower leagues of Canadian soccer. There are no stand-out young prospects, though, and reliance will be heavy on some aging veterans. A learning curve is to be expected for any expansion team, and Edmonton is very much a work in progress.
Ft. Lauderdale Strikers (formerly Miami FC)
How they did last season: 7-11-12, failed to qualify for the USSF Division 2 playoffs.
Players to watch: Abe Thompson, formerly of the Houston Dynamo, scored nine goals for Ft. Lauderdale/Miami last season and will be expected to produce again. Providing service for Thompson will be Argentinian Eduardo Coudet, while fellow former Philadelphia Union player Cristian Arrieta anchors the defense.
Outlook: Ft. Lauderdale added a number of key pieces that could spell success in 2011. The Strikers missed out on the playoffs last season, but that shouldn't be a problem with 75 percent of teams making the postseason this year. The Strikers are by no means the favorite, but if they play up to their potential a top-four finish should be the expectation.
Montreal Impact
How they did last season: 12-11-7, lost in the semifinals of the USSF Division 2 playoffs
Players to watch: Keep an eye on former Toronto FC striker Ali Gerba, who scored 13 goals in 17 appearances last season and could be a serious contender for top scorer in the NASL this season. Montreal padded its defensive resume with the addition of Puerto Rico Islanders goalkeeper Bill Gaudette and French defenseman Kevin Hatchi.
Outlook: It's all about the future for the Impact. Will an NASL title in Montreal be much of a goal considering the move up to MLS next season? Fans would like to think so, but Montreal is definitely building for the future rather than trying to win right now. That being said, Montreal has more than enough talent to stay competitive, and some of its younger players will need to impress in order to make the jump next season. The San Antonio Scorpions are expected to replace the Impact in the NASL in 2012.
NSC Minnesota Stars
How they did last season: 11-12-7, lost in the quarterfinals of the USSF Division 2 playoffs.
Players to watch: Goalkeeper Joe Warren, 36, will need to stand tall behind a back line that is completely unfamiliar with each other. Up front, Simone Bracalello could be one of the top offensive players in the division while Kentaro Takada fills in for standout midfielder Daniel Wasson who is out with a torn ACL.
Outlook: As with most teams in the NASL, continuity is not a given, but this is a group with experience. The back line is patchwork and the strike partnership of Devin Del Do and Bracalello could be dynamic. Minnesota should be one of the more consistent teams and a deep run in the playoffs is possible.
Puerto Rico Islanders
ï»¿
How they did last season: 9-11-10, won the USSF Division 2 title.
Players to watch: The Islanders boast some promising replacements following a bit of an exodus following last year's championship season. Captain Noah Delgado returns for his sixth season with Puerto Rico and is the undoubted leader of a talented side. Also be on the lookout for returning striker David Foley to partner with newcomer Matthew Bouaree.
Outlook: The Islanders did a solid job of replacing some of the players they lost during the off-season while retaining some core components. An early favorite to win the title, Puerto Rico will also be playing in the CONCACAF Champions League, where it famously knocked off the LA Galaxy last season. The Islanders may be talented, but with NASL squads being far from robust, will they tire and slip up down the stretch?
FC Tampa Bay
ï»¿
How they did last season: 7-12-11, failed to qualify for the USSF Division 2 playoffs.
Players to watch: A reformed defense is led by veterans Andres Arrango and Frankie Sanfilippo, who should provide some stability. Versatile midfielder Takuya Yamada is the team's standout player, while Aaron King, who scored 12 goals in 2010, leads what could be a potent attack.
Outlook: Consistency was elusive for Tampa Bay last season, combining for one point in the months of June and September. A completely gutted and rebuilt squad may or may not prove to be successful. Most likely, Tampa Bay will struggle early and get better down the stretch, but fans may be in for difficult spring.

From yesterdays oral argument before the Second Circuit Court of Appeals in the case of Fox Television vs. Federal Communications Commission. How ironic is it that a case dealing with the FCC results in expletives being aired censor-free on national television?From CSPAN:Fox Television is challenging the FCC's indecency standards and the way it punishes broadcasters for airing shows that contain profanity. The network argues that the government is violating the First Amendment by embarking on a "radical reinterpretation and expansion" of its power to punish broadcasters for indecent speech. Fox Television contends that the FCC sharply changed its standards for profanity, that the standards are vague and make little sense in the face of industry changes. The FCC fined Fox for language used by Cher and Nicole Richie on the live broadcasts of the 2002 and 2003 Billboard Music Awards, respectively.
Canada is not off to a strong start at the FIFA women's under-20 World Cup.
The Canadian squad suffered a 5-0 loss against Spain in Group B play on Sunday at Bava Park in Papua New Guinea in the tournament opener for both teams.
Mariona opened the scoring just two minutes in for Spain (1-0-0) and Lucia Garcia doubled the lead in the 30th with her first of the match.
Aitana Bonmati added a third goal in the 58th and another came from Patri in the 87th. Garcia made it a five-goal lead in extra time.
"As a team we are going to keep pushing," said Canadian forward Deanne Rose, a member of the bronze-medal winning team at the Rio Olympics this summer. "We're not holding our heads down, we know there is opportunity going forward, and we are going to keep looking for those opportunities in front of the net and pushing the other teams. No team is out of our reach in terms of winning. If we bring our game, anything can happen."
Alexandria Lamontagne thought she had one back for Canada (0-1-0) in the 84th but was called for offisde.
Canada was dominated much of the match as Spain controlled 66 per cent of possession. Spain also outshot the Canadians 16-7 (7-1 on target).
Group B is rounded out with Japan (0-0-0) and Nigeria (0-0-0), which go head-to-head later today.
Canada's next game is Wednesday against Nigeria.
The Spaniards were runners-up to Sweden in European qualifying for the 16-team world championship.

mutatis mutandis after changing what needed to be changed "with the appropriate changes"
A USGS project called the California Seafloor Mapping Program, ongoing since 2007, has just produced some pretty and highly detailed new maps of the seafloor of the San Francisco Bay and our immediate coastline, as Wired reports. The unprecedented effort has involved data collection through sonar, acoustic backscatter, seismic-reflection profiles, seafloor photos and video, all extending three miles out from the coast, and the maps are just now being released, beginning with maps of San Francisco and the Bay, Tomales Bay, and Drakes Bay.
Among other things, the maps help with modeling for coastal flooding dangers from sea-level rise and large storms, and with identifying offshore active faults and submarine landslides, "providing the basis for earthquake and tsunami hazard assessments and hazard mitigation."
Also, they're pretty! Did you know there was a deep trench right beneath the Golden Gate Bridge, deeper than anywhere else in the Bay or our immediate coast?
See the Tomales Bay bathymetry map below, and check out more here.
And this video shows a virtual flyover of the topography of the seafloor from the entrance to the Bay, up to Bolinas, and down to Pescadero.
Seven years after he was ousted in rebellion, former president arrives on election eve talking of Haitians' plight
Jean-Bertrand Aristide, the pastor-turned-president last seen in his native Haiti making a rapid, undignified exit seven years ago, has returned home to a rapturous welcome, injecting another variable into a febrile election atmosphere 48 hours before a drawn-out presidential race climaxes.
Aristide, the only Haitian leader to have been forced from office twice, offered an exotic mix of poetry and gratitude to the hundreds of supporters who feted him at the airport – and took a sideswipe at the troubled electoral process.
The atmosphere at the airport was charged. It was here after all that Aristide was bundled on to a plane in February 2004, leaving behind a rebellion in full cry and a power vacuum. Since then the country has endured landslides, political stasis and enduring poverty – all compounded by last year's earthquake which killed more than 300,000 people.
"Since the earthquake, the humiliation of the people under tents is the humiliation of all the Haitian people," Aristide said.
For many Haitians, the former populist president who helped oust the Duvalier regime is still admired as a champion of the poor. His repatriation in defiance of US efforts to keep him away until Sunday's election has run its course is seen by many as a restitution of dignity. "President Aristide is a strong leader who doesn't take orders from a superpower such as the United States," said Johnny Mazart, 36, a carpenter. "That's why they ousted him, because he listened to the Haitian people, not foreigners," he told Reuters.
Journalists trampled over barriers to reposition themselves to film the former president as he descended from a long-range private jet accompanied by his family and black rights activist Danny Glover. His wife, Mildred, had tears of joy in her eyes as her daughters buttressed her down the steps on to the Haitian tarmac.
Outside the airport, hundreds of supporters gathered with rara bands and welcoming chants. "Modern-day slavery will have to end today," said Aristide. "The greatest richness of Haiti is Haitians. Remedy for Haiti is love."
Aristide thanked the government of South Africa, which had hosted him, and the friends who helped him return. He switched between Haitian Creole, French, English, Zulu and Spanish, and onlookers cheered at his linguistic and geological references and metaphors about Haiti's plight and his repatriation.
"You can cut off our feet but not our roots that go all the way back to Africa ... This country needs education with dignity without social exclusion ... The exclusion of [his party] Lavalas is exclusion of the majority. The solution is inclusion."
In the Cité Soleil slum, crowds of people were reported to be chanting for the annulment of Sunday's election, which pits the popular musician Michel "Sweet Micky" Martelly and the former first lady Mirlande Manigat. In Solino, another neighbourhood where Aristide commanded much support, the streets were calm but people were unsure sure how to react to the arrival of such a divisive figure on the last day of campaigning.
"He is not here to interrupt the elections," said Wesly Desalan. "He is here to help Haitians get out of the current political crisis."
Later, attention turned to Aristide's house in Tabarre where thousands had gathered and, as at the airport, disregarded the barriers to flood the yard. By contrast, the other towering figure who returned in January, Jean-Claude Duvalier, has been arrested and charged with corruption. Most people, even those who revile Aristide, think he has every right to be back, particularly as Duvalier's return was tolerated.
In front of the crumbled national palace everything was unusually quiet. Saturday is the last day of campaigning before Sunday's run-off vote, and one of the candidates' campaign managers said more than 50,000 people had gathered there on Friday night for a concert by Wyclef Jean, Busta Rhymes, Black Alex and Ti Vice, a group of Haitian musicians endorsing Martelly.
It started out as something of a dinner party crowd-pleaser. After hearing musicians in England playing an arrangement of water-filled wine glasses, Benjamin Franklin (of American ‘Founding Fathers' fame) experimented with creating his own version.
The result was the ‘armonica': 37 glass bowls of different sizes, threaded together on an iron spindle and colour-coded with paint to identify the notes. In contrast to the wine glass version, the bowls were positioned horizontally, allowing the player to sound up to ten notes at the same time. With its delicate sound and unusual appearance, the instrument soon became popular – even French queen Marie Antoinette took lessons – and thousands were built and sold.
So far, so ordinary, until reports from delighted party guests gradually gave way to something altogether more perplexing. Hearing the singing glasses, listeners credited the instrument with mind-altering affects. Princess Izabella Czartoryska of Poland, who met Franklin and his armonica in 1772, wrote an account: 'I was ill, in a state of melancholia, and writing my testament and farewell letters... [Franklin] opened an armonica, sat down and played long. The music made a strong impression on me and tears began flowing from my eyes. Then Franklin sat by my side and looking with compassion said, "Madam, you are cured." Indeed in that moment I was cured of my melancholia.'
Soon, regular players reported unusual side-effects from playing. Tinnitus, disorientation and even 'madness' struck the players with alarming regularity. The instrument was credited with causing evil and endangering the public, and the health warnings were clear: ‘If you are suffering from any kind of nervous disorder, you should not play it; if you are not yet ill you should not play it; if you are feeling melancholy you should not play it,' German musicologist Friedrich Rochlitz wrote.
Reports of mental instability and hysteria soon saw this eerie instrument relegated from the realms solo performance. Opera, however, with its frequent flights of fancy and multiple 'mad scenes', is where this instrumental anomaly found its home.
Its most famous outing was during Donizetti's bel canto tragedy, Lucia di Lammermoor - unsurprisingly, during the 'mad scene', cementing the glass harmonica's place as the soundtrack to unusual or other-worldly activities (often a flute is substituted for the glass harmonica in this scene, since players of the instrument are relatively hard to come by!). It's the unique qualities of the instrument that Beethoven had used to his advantage in a similarly disconcerting scene written 20 years before, in an unpublished extract from Princess Leonore, incidental music composed for a play, Op.202/WoO 96. The play itself is unremarkable, but, unusually for Beethoven, there is a short 'melodrama' for glass harmonica and narrator, at at the point in the play when the heroine Leonore is speaking to her true love from beyond the grave.
If only the players had listened to the steadying voice of science a little earlier. A quick analysis of the tones produced by this maddening instrument reveals they are produced between 1,000 and 4,000 hertz. Sounds of this frequency are difficult for the ear to place, and the result is that listeners are unable to work out where the music is coming from: 'beyond the grave', unsurprisingly, no longer stands up as a credible answer.
But it wasn't just the sound that caused players and listeners alike to lose their wits. The lead crystal used in the manufacturing of the instrument reportedly had an effect on all those who spent hours in its company, causing them to hallucinate or even faint. One such player, Marianne Kirchgessner, died at the age of 39, with the instrument being blamed for her untimely death. Science, again, debunks this theory: lead poisoning was common in the 18th and early 19th centuries for both armonica players and non-players alike.
Nowadays, with science on its side, the glass harmonica has a small but devoted fan base. It's not hard to find plentiful examples of the instrument on YouTube or Spotify, where the likes of Björk, David Gilmour and Tom Waits are among those to have offered it a guest spot on their albums. But even despite a celebrity following, it's fair to say the instrument hasn't yet shaken its dangerous reputation. After years in the shadows the glass harmonica enjoyed its time in the operatic limelight in George Benjamin's 2013 work, Written on Skin, but the associations were clear. As the singer descended into madness, the eerie song of the glass harmonica could be heard from somewhere imperceptible. Science tells us it was the orchestra pit, but you never can be sure...
Lucia di Lammermoor runs until 27 November. Tickets are still available.
This article was originally published during the 2015/16 Season, where our performances of Lucia di Lammermoor featured a glass harmonica. This Season's performances will feature a flute.
WASHINGTON — Debating an overhaul of the health care system, the Senate found itself tied in knots on Thursday over a bipartisan proposal to allow people to import lower-cost prescription drugs from Canada and certain other countries.
Democratic leaders delayed a vote, in part, because they feared that the proposal would be approved, potentially blowing apart a deal negotiated by the White House and the pharmaceutical industry.
The industry, represented by the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, or PhRMA, adamantly opposes legalizing additional imports and says the government could not guarantee the safety of imported medicines.
As members of Congress before last year's election, President Obama and his chief of staff, Rahm Emanuel, supported efforts to allow drug imports. But now the Obama administration, like pharmaceutical companies and the Bush administration, is raising safety concerns.

The chief sponsor of the proposal, Senator Byron L. Dorgan, Democrat of North Dakota, said: “People are walking on eggshells. If we pass legislation allowing people freedom to import drugs, the pharmaceutical industry might not support the health care bill.”
Without some form of morality, it is difficult to tell a good story. In any meaningful story, and therefore in any meaningful life, a character must have a sense of right and wrong, and that sense of right and wrong has to be universal. If his sense of right and wrong isn't universal, he is a psychopath, and if he has no morality, his story is not going to be meaningful.
Many people are moral for religious reasons, stating their morality comes from the Bible or a sacred text (which, while these books can influence morality, are not written with the intention of defining a moral code. If they are, they are terribly written and the authors couldn't land their point.) Natural Law, then, becomes a kind of catch-all conglomerate of sacred texts, an attempt to arrive at a universal code for meaningful morality in a civilized society. As a culture, America subscribes to natural law even more than Constitutional law. The foundation for constitutional law is natural law and without it, the constitution makes no sense. In some ways, I think, the constitution is a defense of natural law. But each time a debate takes place regarding a Supreme court justice, the old debate of natural law and constitutional law rises again. It's an important debate, but lately I've been wondering about another, perhaps more universal and less debatable form of law. I'm wondering about a law that, while more prophetic, is perhaps somewhat more verifiable in terms of its ability to create meaningful experiences for members of a society.
I've been wondering lately about the possibility of a new perspective on law. I've been wondering about our need for what I'll call narrative law. Lately I've been thinking of the importance of morality more in story terms than in black and white notions of right and wrong. Nothing against black and white notions of right and wrong, only my sense is that those who subscribe to those notions do so with a self-righteous motive, which is in itself immoral (in story construction) and no better than kicking dogs. Such notions, mostly coming from a sacred text, are also difficult to verify in terms of their ability to create meaning. People will always push back when you try to put boundaries on their pleasure.
In religious communities, morality matters because it is offered in submission to God. But this is not enough for a post-religious culture. (Not that we as Americans are post-religious, but much of the rest of the west is and we certainly have our post-religious quadrants, including the media.) Is morality important to me because there exists a God? Yes. Do I practice morality because there exists a God? I'm not sure. Perhaps. But such a perspective leads to fear/guilt/shame and so forth, and those emotions create binary reactions to their controlling characteristics. (Ever wonder why Christians in the Bible Belt have so much trouble drinking in moderation, and therefore think of drinking as sin? The criminal may be the black-and-white mentality, not the wine.)
Morality, in the last couple years, has felt more important to me because of it's demand in narrative structure. Robert McKee, perhaps the leading scholar on story structure, believes that stories are not as good as they used to be. And though McKee is not a religious man, he imagines the principle issue in the decline of story is this erosion of morality. In his book Story, he says it this way:
“The final cause of the decline of story runs very deep. Values, the positive/negative charges of life, are at the soul of our art. The writer shapes story around a perception of what's worth living for and what's worth dying for, what is foolish to pursue, the meaning of justice, truth-the essential values. In decades past, writer and society more or less agreed on these questions, but more and more ours has become an age of moral and ethcical cynicism, relativism, and subjectivism – a great confusion of values. As the family disintegrates and sexual antagonisms rise, who, for example, feels he understands the nature of love? And how, if you do have a conviction, do you express it to an ever-more skeptical audience? This erosion of values has brought with it a corresponding erosion of story.”
If story is a litmus test through which we can determine what is meaningful in life, than morality certainly has meaning. Without morality, a character cannot tell a good story, and once the credits roll in his life, he will realize he journeyed without a compass, and took himself precisely nowhere in all his travels.
I'm aware that a number of readers of this blog are not people of faith. Narrative law, however, does not require faith, except a faith in narrative structure, that is. In an age when males procure their inner-need for masculine affirmation through sexual conquest rather than the care and protection of the female heart, and the family has indeed disintegrated, a sober case for a universal morality is a demand in short supply. When our consumption of goods demands bond-servants in textile mills in Asia, we are in need of a universal morality. And when media methodology reduces truth to polarizing perspectives in order to ratchet up perceived tensions only to report on the tensions they've caused, we are in need of a moral center.
What encourages me most about the potential for narrative law is it's broad appeal to religious and non-religious communities. Perhaps narrative law is a form of morality we can find more common ground in, and less debate, than that of natural law.
In short, I'm wondering if narrative structure can help us define universal morality. Some who read this blog will respond by demanding that everybody kneel to the moral structure posited by their sacred text, but this is irrational. Again, their sacred text does not contain a complete moral code, and regardless, not everybody in a free society should be forced to adhere to it. But perhaps more of us can adhere to a moral structure having been created through the study of effective narrative.

Ringstar Sports, which is the new company run by former Golden Boy Promotions CEO Richard Schaefer, has finalized a Premier Boxing Champions doubleheader for December 10th at USC's Galen Center in Los Angeles, California. Tom Brown of TGB Promotions is the co-promoter of the event.
Two titles fights will take place on the card. Former three division champion Abner Mares will finally collide with WBA 'regular' featherweight champion Jesus Cuellar in the main event. The co-feature, is the long awaited fight between International Boxing Federation super welterweight champion Jermall Charlo and mandatory challenger Julian Williams.
The card will be Schaefer's first boxing event since leaving Golden Boy back in June of 2014. Schaefer announced his return to the sport a few months ago.
Schaefer's debut of Ringstar was first pegged to take place on October 15th, with a rumored fight between Danny Garcia and Andre Berto in the main event at Staples Center, but the fight never came together with Garcia deciding to go in another direction.
Mares vs. Cuellar was originally set for June 25 in Brooklyn as part of the Keith Thurman-Shawn Porter undercard. The fell out at the last minute when the New York State Athletic Commission refused to give Mares medical clearance to fight - because of an issue with his medical history. The NYSAC is very strict when it comes to approving any fighter to compete when they've had eye surgery in the past.
Back in 2008, Mares had a detached retina and underwent a lasik procedure for his right eye. The California State Athletic Commission has evaluated Mares' health and vision through a series of exams.
“To do my first event from Galen Center is very meaningful because while I've been out, I've sent my two boys to USC, and these are the kinds of events I like to put together – two 50/50 fights in which the best fight the best,” Schaefer told The Los Angeles Times.

“In this world,” Benjamin Franklin wrote, “nothing can be said to be certain, except death and taxes.”
With all due respect to the First American and resident of Philadelphia, that's just not true. This issue, SLAM Presents IVERSON, was certain to come to fruition, too.
After all, SLAM and Iverson have an inimitable relationship that helped propel both the magazine and the man to new heights.
A brief history: When he was still at Georgetown, an upstart magazine called SLAM put him on his first national magazine cover. His rookie year, even while the Philadelphia 76ers found wins hard to come by, SLAM once again put him on the cover. During the lockout-shortened 1999 season, SLAM had him rock an afro and dollops of dangling ice. Over the course of the ensuing 10-plus years, he appeared on 13 more covers.
During a run from 1994 until now, no matter what was going on in his very public personal life, Allen Iverson made time for SLAM and SLAM made time for Allen Iverson.
“Anything SLAM needs from me would be done,” Iverson said a few years ago. “I'll never forget what SLAM did for me. SLAM gave me a whole new fanbase, made me more popular than what I was doing out there on the basketball court. Kids still talk about it. Kids still have the magazine. You've always been loyal to me.”
As a result of that bond forged through a Hall of Fame career filled with Everest highs and Dead Sea lows, as a result of the raw photo shoots and exclusive interviews and unparalleled access, Allen Iverson and SLAM became, in a very real way, synonymous.
With the Philadelphia 76ers retiring his No. 3 jersey this coming Saturday night, March 1, it only made sense to dive into our wealth of Allen Iverson connections and material. It only made sense to come out with a special issue dedicated to Allen Iverson.
Things being the way they are, it would have been hard to come out with this issue alone, so SLAM partnered with Reebok Classic on this project. It only made sense, if you take a step back, to collaborate with the company that always stood by Iverson's side.
“SLAM has been a phenomenal partner for Reebok and AI throughout the years,” says Todd Krinsky, Reebok's VP of Global Classics and Basketball. “Allen lives at the intersection of basketball, music and culture and clearly this is SLAM's territory as well. We have had some great photo shoots and their AI covers are legendary. It was a no-brainer to partner with them on this project.”
SLAM being SLAM, and Iverson being Iverson, you know that SLAM Presents IVERSON is both artistic and comprehensive. In part, this collector's issue is comprised of essays about the 11-time All-Star, interviews with him, quotes from a rang of NBA stars about him, as well as a slew of rare and never before seen photos of him. All of this carefully curated content serves to cover the entirety of his game-changing, culture-shifting career.
Reebok being Reebok, we incorporated some flavor, which we otherwise would not have been able to. As a direct result of working with them, we were able to include a section on Iverson's complete sneaker history. That means we have beauty shots and descriptions of every Reebok silhouette Iverson ever wore, starting with the Question Mid and ending with the Answer XIII.
Additionally, this 100 percent Iverson issue includes a first glimpse at the five Question Mids that Reebok Classic is releasing in 2014. Kept under tight wraps until now, the first of the five colorways, a limited-edition look called the Banner Ceremony, makes its official debut in these pages.
While the much-coveted Banner Ceremony will be released by Reebok Classic shortly, the much-deserved banner ceremony will definitely take place this coming Saturday night.
“You and I will never know how much that day will mean to me,” Iverson texted SLAM, while this issue was being put together. “It will probably bring me to tears. I'm so excited with anticipation, I could never begin to thank all of that the people that I want to thank on that day.”
Once again, maybe for the final time, Iverson will be the main attraction at a Sixers' game. You can be sure SLAM will be on hand to take in the moment.
And you can be certain that issues of SLAM Presents IVERSON will be available all over newsstands to help you celebrate his momentous career, too.

The Dallas hospital that mistakenly sent home a man who had Ebola says flawed software and not human error caused doctors to miss the diagnosis.
Health officials and local residents have been asking how the hospital could have missed what would have appeared to be an obvious potential case of Ebola: a Liberian citizen who said he recently traveled from Liberia, with fever and abdominal pain.
“Protocols were followed by both the physician and the nurses,” the hospital said in a statement issued Thursday night.
The nurse who took Thomas Eric Duncan's medical history did the job correctly, the hospital said.
“However, we have identified a flaw in the way the physician and nursing portions of our electronic health records (EHR) interacted in this specific case,” it added.
“In our electronic health records, there are separate physician and nursing workflows. The documentation of the travel history was located in the nursing workflow portion of the EHR, and was designed to provide a high reliability nursing process to allow for the administration of influenza vaccine under a physician-delegated standing order. As designed, the travel history would not automatically appear in the physician's standard workflow.”
In other words, the nurse wrote that Duncan had come from Liberia, but the doctors who examined him would not have automatically seen that. And they were not prompted to ask.
“As result of this discovery, Texas Health Dallas has relocated the travel history documentation to a portion of the EHR that is part of both workflows. It also has been modified to specifically reference Ebola-endemic regions in Africa,” the hospital said.
“We have made this change to increase the visibility and documentation of the travel question in order to alert all providers. We feel that this change will improve the early identification of patients who may be at risk for communicable diseases, including Ebola.”
The hospital also gave more detail about Duncan, who traveled from Monrovia to Dallas Sept. 19 and who started feeling ill Sept. 24. He first sought care on Sept. 26.
“Mr. Duncan presented with a temperature of 100.1F, abdominal pain for two days, a sharp headache, and decreased urination. These symptoms could be associated with many communicable diseases, as well as many other types of illness. When he was asked whether he had nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea, he said no. Additionally, Mr. Duncan's symptoms were not severe at the time he first visited the hospital emergency department,” the hospital said.
"When Mr. Duncan was asked if he had been around anyone who had been ill, he said that he had not."
“When Mr. Duncan was asked if he had been around anyone who had been ill, he said that he had not,” it added.
NBC News has interviewed a taxi driver and other witnesses who say Duncan traveled in the taxi with a pregnant woman who appeared to be miscarrying and who later died of Ebola. They said Duncan helped her.
On November 8, 2016, in a stunning upset, Donald Trump was elected president of the United States. The Republican Party, under whose banner he ran, retained control over both the House and Senate. President Trump will be able to appoint at least one Supreme Court justice almost immediately and possibly more during his term in office. He will also appoint dozens of district and appellate court judges. Finally, he will presumably replace the cabinet secretaries and most of the political appointees in the Departments of Health and Human Services, Labor, and Treasury -- that administer the Affordable Care Act. The Republicans own the national government, and many state governments.
So what does his victory mean for the Affordable Care Act? This post is a tentative first pass at this question. More will follow. It only addresses the coverage expansion of the ACA and does not discuss Medicare or prescription drugs, two other areas likely deeply affected by a Trump presidency.
Donald Trump states at his website, “On day one of the Trump Administration, we will ask Congress to immediately deliver a full repeal of Obamacare.” If by Obamacare Trump means the Affordable Care Act in its entirety, this will not happen. First, any repeal proposal would be subject to a filibuster in the Senate and the Democrats retain more than enough votes to stop a repeal bill. Second, the Affordable Care Act contains hundreds of provisions affecting Medicare, program integrity, the health care workforce, biosimilars, prevention, and other issues unrelated to what most Americans think of as “Obamacare.” Immediate repeal of the ACA and presumably restoring the law that preceded it would likely bring the Medicare program, for example, to a halt until new rules could be written. The ACA is inextricably interwoven into our health care system and is not going away immediately.
The Uses And Limits Of The Budget Reconciliation Process
Congress and the President, can, however, repeal many of the provisions that are identified by the public as “Obamacare” using the budget reconciliation process. A budget reconciliation bill can be passed by a simple majority and cannot be stopped by a filibuster. The final ACA in 2010 contained provisions passed through the budget reconciliation process after the Democrats lost their filibuster-proof majority.
Budget reconciliation legislation is subject to strict procedural and substantive limits. Reconciliation in the Senate can only contain provisions that affect the revenues and outlays of the United States and cannot contain “extraneous provisions” that only incidentally affect revenue and expenditures. Budget reconciliation is a two-step process—first Congress adopts a budget resolution with instructions to committees to meet reconciliation targets and then it adopts the reconciliation itself. This cannot happen on “day one.”
Congress took a dry run at repeal budget reconciliation legislation in 2015. Both houses of Congress passed reconciliation legislation that would have repealed the premium tax credits; the small business tax credit; the individual mandate, the employer mandate; the expansion of Medicaid coverage for adults up to 138 percent of the federal poverty level, presumptive eligibility, maintenance of effort, and benchmark plans for Medicaid; and the ACA's taxes—the medical device tax, insurer fee, “Cadillac” high cost plan tax, and tax increases imposed on the wealthy—most of the provisions that the public identifies as “Obamacare.” The legislation was vetoed by President Obama. The legislation would also have defunded Planned Parenthood. Presumably this legislation, already vetted for compliance with reconciliation requirements, could serve as a model for ACA repeal.
Importantly, reconciliation legislation could probably not change the insurance reform provisions of the ACA—the ban on preexisting condition exclusions and health status underwriting, caps on annual and lifetime dollar limits, actuarial value requirements, age underwriting restrictions, as they do not affect revenues and outlays. The continued imposition of these requirements without the financing provided by the ACA could cause serious distortions and damage in insurance markets. It is possible that changes to other sections of the ACA could be made part of other “must pass” legislation, although it is hard to see what that might be.
The 'Replace' Part Of Repeal And Replace
Repeal would, moreover, raise the question of what would replace the ACA. The Congressional Budget Office estimated that enacting the 2015 reconciliation legislation would increase the number of uninsured Americans by 22 million. The legislation would have delayed the end of the premium tax credits until 2018 to allow time for replacement legislation, which was not part of the bill.
Donald Trump has advocated tax deductions and tax subsidies for health savings accounts (HSAs) to make health insurance more affordable for those who lack it. These provisions may help some wealthier individuals, but would do little or nothing for the millions of people now receiving tax credits for coverage through the ACA, who often pay little in taxes and receive little benefit from deductions and have little to save in HSAs. Other Republican plans offer fixed dollar tax credits to purchase insurance, which would be of more value to low-income Americans, but would likely fall far short of the cost of coverage now covered by the ACA.
A Republican replacement plan could not be implemented overnight, however. Regulations would have to be written and published for comment and mechanisms set up to handle the deductions or credits, particularly if they were provided in advance, as they would have to be. Even a two year delay might not be enough to get a program in place, much less to educate the public as to how it operated.
What President Trump Could Do On His Own To Undermine The ACA
Although Donald Trump cannot unilaterally repeal and replace the ACA, he can do a great deal to interfere with its implementation. As has been exhaustively chronicled on this blog, the ACA has been implemented by hundreds of pages of regulations and thousands of pages of guidance. Regulations cannot legally be changed without an opportunity for notice and comment and some explanation as to why a change is necessary. Guidance is easier to change.
Indeed, a Trump administration could do a great deal of damage to the ACA without even changing regulations or guidance. If a Trump administration simply stopped implementing or enforcing certain regulatory requirements, there might be little that could be done about it. Just a change in leadership in the agencies implementing the ACA will cause months of disruption, and appointment of leadership committed to destroying rather than implementing the ACA will likely cause a mass exodus of lower level employees, causing an implementation vacuum.
The Obama administration is currently engaged in an aggressive campaign to enroll individuals for the 2017 open enrollment period. A Trump administration could abandon this effort, as well as efforts to work with insurers to ensure continued ACA participation or with consumers to resolve enrollment issues. The 2015 reconciliation legislation would have required marketplace enrollees who underestimated their income to pay back all excess tax credits, regardless of the financial hardship this would cause. This might create a significant deterrence to enrollment. The repeal of the individual mandate would also discourage participation.
A number of insurers have lost money in the marketplaces. Some have withdrawn and others have stuck with the program in hopes it would turn around. Without an administration committed to the program, more will almost certainly withdraw, potentially leaving parts of the country where no marketplace plans are available. Others might raise their rates in the face of the uncertainty caused by the transition, making coverage even less affordable to individuals without premium tax credits.
A Trump administration is likely to work with conservative states to loosen remaining ACA requirements. Under section 1332 states can be granted “innovation” waivers from many ACA requirements if they can provide similar coverage under their own proposals. The Obama administration has interpreted the requirements of this provision quite conservatively, but Trump could give out the waivers much more loosely to allow states to opt out of the ACA. Trump has also proposed block-granting Medicaid, a proposal that would shift much of the burden of Medicaid financing to the states. Republicans believe that the flexibility afforded by block grants could allow states to innovate and run Medicaid more cost-effectively, but millions of Americans could lose Medicaid coverage if the block grants do not keep pace with costs.
The CHIP program also comes up for reauthorization in 2017, and Trump opposition could end CHIP as well, potentially leaving millions of children without coverage.
The Obama administration is currently involved in a number of lawsuits involving the ACA. A Trump administration might simply cease defending these lawsuits, effectively allowing the plaintiffs to triumph. If the government withdrew its appeal in House v. Burwell, for example, reimbursement to insurers for cost-sharing reduction payments could cease. Indeed, the administration could simply stop paying cost-sharing reduction payments, although this would probably take a rule change. Ending cost-sharing reduction payments would dramatically increase the cost of marketplace participation by insurers and likely lead to many insurers exiting the program. It is possible that beneficiaries or insurers could sue to reinstate the payments, but that would take time, and would likely not happen quickly enough to save the program.
The administration will also likely cease defending the contraceptive cases, indeed may likely revoke the contraceptive coverage requirement. And it will likely take a more aggressive position opposing the insurer risk corridor cases in the court of claims.
It is possible that consumer and insurer groups will file lawsuits against the administration seeking to force implementation of provisions of the ACA that remain in place. This litigation could take the place of the anti-ACA litigation the administration has fought for years. Litigants may follow the path of ACA opponents and find sympathetic district court judges in isolated districts in liberal circuits looking for easy victories. A Trump appointed Supreme Court will make progressive litigation victories harder to stick.
Now It's The GOP's Turn
The Democrats controlled the presidency and both houses of Congress in 2010. They adopted legislation that they hoped would dramatically increase access to health care for lower-income Americans. In many respects they succeeded, covering 20 million Americans and reducing the uninsured rate to the lowest levels in history. But many Americans believe, rightly or wrongly, that they have been disadvantaged by the ACA, and dissatisfaction with it has remained high, particularly as premiums increased and insurer participation decreased in the marketplaces this year.
It is now the Republicans' turn. They will have to decide what they want to do with our health care system and figure out how to do it. They now own the problems of health care, and they will be judged in future elections for how they address them.
Jason William Mizell (January 21, 1965 – October 30, 2002), better known by his stage name Jam Master Jay, was an American musician and DJ. He was the DJ of the influential hip hop group Run-D.M.C. During the 1980s, Run-D.M.C. became one of the biggest hip-hop groups and are credited with breaking hip-hop into mainstream music.[1][2]
For his skill re-working riffs from classic guitar records, he was ranked #10 on Spin's list of the "100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time.[3] On October 30, 2002, while recording new music at his studio in the Jamaica district of Queens, New York City, Mizell was shot and killed by an unknown assailant.
Early life [ edit ]
Jason Mizell was born in Brooklyn, New York City,[4] the son of Jesse Mizell and Connie Thompson Mizell[5] (later Connie Mizell-Perry)[6] whose other children are Marvin L. Thompson and Bonita Jones.[5]
At age 3, Jason began playing trumpet. He learned to play bass, guitar, and drums. He performed at his church and in various bands prior to discovering turntablism.[5] After he and his family moved to Hollis, Queens, New York City in 1975, he discovered the turntables and started DJing at the age of 13.[4][5] For a time, he lived in Atlantic City, New Jersey, where turntablism pioneer DJ Def Lou Hauck [4][7] taught him to crossfade.[4][7] He caught on quickly because of his musical experience and after a year of DJing he felt that he was good enough to play in front of people.[4][7] Originally calling himself Jazzy Jase, he attended high school at Andrew Jackson High School in Queens.[5]
Career [ edit ]
He first started playing at parks and later played at bars. He also began throwing small parties around the area.[7] Once he got a pair of Technics 1200s he improved rapidly since he was able to practice at night with headphones on when he was supposed to be sleeping.[7]
Mizell became a DJ because he "just wanted to be a part of the band".[7][8] Prior to joining Run-D.M.C., he played bass and drums in several garage bands. In 1982, he joined Joseph "Run" Simmons and Darryl "D.M.C." McDaniels just after they graduated from high school and agreed to DJ for them because he wanted to be part of the band.[4][8] On Run-D.M.C's album Raising Hell, Mizell played keyboards, bass, and live drums in addition to his turntable work.[4] Mizell remained in his childhood neighborhood in Hollis, Queens his entire life.
In 1989, Mizell established Jam Master Jay Records. The label is most known for signing 50 Cent and Onyx. Jam Master Jay Records folded after Jason Mizell was murdered on October 30, 2002. The crime has yet to be solved.[9]
Mizell's legacy includes the Scratch DJ Academy in Manhattan. Founded in 2002, the year of his death, the academy was created to "provide unparalleled education and access to the art form of the DJ and producer."[10]
Personal life [ edit ]
Jam Master Jay was related to the Mizell Brothers, a popular production team for Gary Bartz, Johnny "Hammond" Smith, and others.[11]
On consecutive Christmas holidays, Mizell survived a car accident and a gunshot wound to the leg, respectively.[7]
Jam Master Jay was the father of three sons: Jason Mizell Jr. (who performs as DJ Jam Master J'Son), Jesse Mizell, and T.J. Mizell (also a DJ).[5][12][13] and a daughter, Tyra Myricks (born August 1992).[14]
Death [ edit ]
On October 30, 2002, at 7:30 pm,[15] an unknown person fatally shot Mizell in a Merrick Boulevard recording studio in Jamaica, Queens. The other person in the room, 25-year-old Urieco Rincon, was shot in the ankle but survived.[9] Following his death, several artists expressed their grief for the loss in the hip hop community and remembered him for his influence on music and the genre.[16] Mizell was buried at Ferncliff Cemetery and Mausoleum in Hartsdale, New York.[17]
In 2003, Kenneth McGriff, a convicted drug dealer and longtime friend of Murder Inc. founders Irving "Irv Gotti" Lorenzo and his older brother Christopher, was investigated for targeting Mizell because the DJ defied an industry blacklist of rapper 50 Cent that was imposed because of "Ghetto Qu'ran", a song 50 Cent wrote about McGriff's drug history.[18]
In April 2007, federal prosecutors named Ronald Washington as an accomplice in the murder.[19] Washington also is a suspect in the 1995 murder of Randy "Stretch" Walker, a former close associate of the late rapper Tupac Shakur, who was also murdered.[19] According to court papers filed by the prosecution, Washington "pointed his gun at those present in the studio, ordered them to get on the ground and provided cover for his associate to shoot and kill Jason Mizell."[19] However, he was never convicted, no new suspects have been named, and Mizell's murder remains unsolved.[20]
In 2018, Netflix released a documentary analyzing the circumstances of his murder.[21] ReMastered: Who Killed Jam Master Jay?, the third episode of Netflix's ReMastered music documentary series, interviews several of Mizell's friends, family members and acquaintances who share stories they've heard regarding suspects in his murder.[22] The documentary does not come to a conclusion regarding whom the murderer(s) are.[23]

Up until Super Bowl Sunday, sharks were just another "group of fish characterized by a cartilaginous skeleton, five to seven gill slits on the sides of the head, and pectoral fins that are not fused to the head."
After Katy Perry undulated between a pair of them during her Super Bowl halftime show, however, everyone was like, "We're going to need a bigger boat -- for all these shark-related memes and ish."
The fervor with which people embraced these beasts (BTW, we do not recommend actually embracing these beasts) even compelled Katy Perry's lawyers to lay claim to the likeness of the esteemed "Left Shark" after a sculptor named Fernando Sosa started hawking it in effigy.
The trouble is, friends, Katy Perry was not the true progenitor of the dancing shark. No, before Perry led a troupe of palm trees and beach balls and whatnot in a rousing chorus of "California Gurls," Seattle band Tacocat was surfing the wave with a very similar cast of characters in their video, "Crimson Wave."
(Also, you know, sharks have been around for, like, millions and millions of years. So...)
With all this blood in the water, we hit up Tacocat to find out what they thought of the halftime show -- and the drama it hath wrought:
MTV: What did you think when you saw the Super Bowl halftime show? Were you like, 'Katy, you fiend -- you ripped off our video!'?
Emily: I didn't get to see the Super Bowl live because I was moving. I was kind of avoiding my phone to see if I could tell if the Seahawks won just by hearing people rioting outside or whatever, but when I gave in, my phone was blowing up with Katy Perry-related text messages and tweets and photos of her actin' like she was in our video! We demand a public apology. Or she can take us on tour. Either or.
Eric: I was watching it with Lelah and we just looked at each other and I think I said, 'Ummm does this look familiar to you? She's ripping us off!' I immediately started tweeting, but I kept getting interrupted by texts.
Lelah: That halftime show was the second best thing I've ever seen with my own two eyes (the first being Miley). I watched it again at home and it gave me goosebumps... like four or five times. I am mostly really proud of Katy and happy to be associated. It was fun to share that 'WTF' moment with Eric as we watched it live, though.
Side note: Later that night I made a picture of Katy, and I guess what would be the 'right shark,' into my phone background image. I was so proud of myself I posted a screenshot of it to the band Instagram.
Bree: It definitely hurt our feelings a little bit that she would rip us off so hard. It's like, I thought I knew her better because I saw her softer side in that that documentary.
MTV: How did you come up with the concept for your video?
Emily: Well, 'Crimson Wave' is all about surfing the, um, crimson wave, and going to the beach with your friends to forget about your period, so we met with Mary Stone-Francois (she made the video) and just rapped about making the video a huge beach party with seashells, actual sand, dancing crabs, lobsters, and sharks -- and all our friends dancing in bathing suits and shorts... Plus a balloon drop. It's just stuffed we already like anyway, so it fit with our aesthetic and the song perfectly.
It goes without saying that we have trademark/copyrighted the concept of beach parties and dancing sharks. And fun.
MTV: Do you think Katy has seen it?
Emily: Definitely. Um, if not, Tacocat officially invites Katy Perry to come over for a video-viewing sleepover after her public apology. We'll bake her a cake and make her cotton-candy sundaes! We have so much nail polish and glitter. And a cat I think she would appreciate.
Eric: Well, some jerk on Twitter has GUARANTEED us that she hasn't. I doubt he even knows Katy Perry IRL though.
Bree: Well, since we are a Seattle band and she was playing the halftime show for the Seahawks, I don't see how it's possible that she DIDN'T see it. You know?
MTV: What do you think of the legal kerfluffle over rights to the shark images?
Emily: Ugh, that kind of thing -- her lawyers threatening to sue over 3D-printed images of that shark costume -- just makes it seem like you don't have a sense of humor. Like people who get upset and threaten legal action against Weird Al.
I mean, it's a dancing shark! It's supposed to be fun! Dancing sharks aren't serious. Dancing sharks are embarrassed to be taken so seriously. And isn't it ultimately more free publicity/relevancy if people use that image because they think it's funny? Anyway, if her lawyers need something to do, they can get a public apology together. We'll wait.
Bree: I think her recording a public apology in every language a posting it to YouTube would really go a long way with us. We are very reasonable people.
Since Netflix's priorities are shifting more to the production of original content, piracy is also turning into a more serious problem. The company wasn't very concerned about copyright infringement in the past, but today it has its own "Global Copyright Protection Group" and an anti-piracy focus that's on par with many major Hollywood studios.
A few years ago Netflix had a pretty casual stance when it came to online piracy.
At the time, Netflix CEO Reed Hastings said that they were keeping an eye on the phenomenon, stressing that it's not exclusively a bad thing. It also creates demand, he argued.
“Certainly there's some torrenting that goes on, and that's true around the world, but some of that just creates the demand,” Hastings said.
Netflix openly admitted to using torrent download data as a market signal, buying shows that are popular among pirates in a certain region. The best way to beat piracy is to provide good options, the mantra was.
While it's still an important issue, Netflix as a company has a different role now. With an increasing number of original shows, it's becoming a significant content producer, instead of ‘just' a distribution platform.
Interestingly, this also shows in Netflix's approach to piracy. The casual stance has long gone, and today Netflix is operating on par with the major Hollywood studios when it comes to copyright enforcement efforts.
Last year we reported that the company had begun sending DMCA takedown notices on a large scale, but its actions don't stop there. While Netflix doesn't boast about its anti-piracy efforts in public, a recent job listing for a Global Copyright Protection Counsel is quite a revelation.
The counsel in question will support Netflix's “Global Copyright Protection Group,” a department the streaming service hasn't mentioned in public thus far. One of the key focuses of the job is to minimize online piracy, through an advanced strategy.
“He or she will be tasked with supporting the Netflix Global Copyright Protection Group in its industry-wide anti-piracy strategic initiatives and tactical take down efforts with the goal of reducing online piracy to a socially unacceptable fringe activity.”
The responsibilities that come with the job are very broad, touching on pretty much every piracy angle utilized by Hollywood studios in recent years. Ranging from leak-prevention to automated takedown efforts, Netflix has it covered.
Counsel, Global Copyright Protection
The prospective employee will assist in “enforcement activities” and conduct “piracy trends analysis” while keeping an eye on the overall piracy ecosystem, including third-party platforms such as search engines, social media, advertisers, payment processors, domain name registrars.
In addition to traditional pirate sites, the anti-piracy efforts also focus on streaming devices, including fully-loaded Kodi boxes, and anonymizer tools such as VPNs and proxies.
“Consider solutions to deal with new piracy models and ways to consume pirate content online, such as illicit streaming devices and the use of TV add on apps. Monitor use of circumvention and anonymizer tools in the online pirate world,” the job application reads.
The application further mentions a review of “piracy demand” and “piracy messaging projects,” suggesting a concrete outreach to consumers. In addition, Netflix will directly reach out to pirate sites and other intermediaries.
“Assist in the management of Netflix correspondence with and outreach to both the administrators of pirate sites and the facilitators of piracy, including hosting platforms and providers, social media platforms and UGC sites in response to our tactical and industry copyright protection efforts.”
Overall the job application paints a picture of a rather mature and complete anti-piracy program and strategy. Now that copyrights are becoming a more vital asset for Netflix, it's likely to become even more advanced as time progresses.
That's quite a leap from the casual stance a few years ago. Apparently, Netflix now believes that solving piracy isn't just as simple as making content available. They also want a ‘stick' with their carrot.
Mufti village, near Mosul - Lieutenant-Colonel Omar Mawlud, 51, and his men look at a hole in the ground with bewilderment. It's one of the three entrances to a tunnel dug by the fighters of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL, also known as ISIS) in Mufti to protect them from air strikes by the United States-led international coalition.
A few metres away, the head of an ISIL suicide bomber, unrecognisably severed, still lies on the ground. "He chased one of our men who went to check out the tunnel," says Mawlud, who is an officer in the Kurdish Peshmerga forces. "Then he blew himself up and injured our fellow Peshmerga too."
Fearing the presence of explosives or suicide bombers, the Peshmerga forces did not want to take the risk of entering and inspecting the whole length of the tunnel and set it on fire.
It felt like I was born again. It was like when you see your mother after a long time. The village and the land are everything to us. Salah Aziz, a Kakai from Majidiya village
Last March, Iraqi and Kurdish forces launched the Nineveh Liberation Operation which they said was the first episode in a series of battles to recapture the northern Nineveh province. Progress, however, has been slow owing to heavy resistance by ISIL fighters.
The tunnel is one of a few dug by ISIL fighters here to use as a shelter against air strikes or to facilitate movement between houses underground. On Monday Mufti, along with eight other villages, was captured by the Kurdish Peshmerga. The villages, located just some 20km east of the ISIL stronghold of Mosul, fell under ISIL control in August 2014.
Nineveh is a culturally rich province located 400km northwest of Baghdad. The villages in this part of the Nineveh Plain, located east of the province, are home mostly to religious minority groups such as Kakais and Shabaks. The few thousand residents fled when ISIL took over, fearing massacres as had happened previously to members of the Yazidi minority on the western side of Nineveh province.
The Kurdish forces hope this offensive will increase pressure on ISIL in Mosul. A few kilometres south of the once Shabak-populated Mufti lies the village of Majidiya, known by the locals as Kulabor.
Salah Aziz, 46, had his eyes filled with tears when, after nearly two years, he finally got a chance to see the village where he spent almost all his life. "It felt like I was born again," said Aziz, a Kakai. "It was like when you see your mother after a long time. The village and the land are everything to us."
The Kakai faith, also referred to as Yarsanism, is a syncretistic mystical faith that is believed to have originated in Kurdish-dominated parts of western Iran in the 14th century. Aziz, who now lives in the nearby Khabat area, had just returned from the funeral of four fellow Kakais who were killed when they had gone to inspect their home in the village of Tullaband which had been taken from ISIL on May 30.
The incident illustrates the tremendous challenge that villagers in this area now face: How to get rid of the many bombs and booby traps planted by ISIL in their villages.
As things stand right now, Aziz and other former residents of these villages, who spoke to Al Jazeera, say they have no ambition to go back to their homes in the near future. Many homes are destroyed and there are no public services such as electricity. On top of that, ISIL is just a couple of kilometres away and the area is within the group's firing range.
On the day Al Jazeera visited the area, a couple of mortar rockets landed in the villages where the Peshmerga forces are currently gathered.
Despite the physical damage, ISIL's attacks in the Nineveh plains appear to have left a more enduring and profound impact. The group's atrocities and efforts at pitting communities against one another has deepened communal rifts in the Nineveh plains where a diverse range of religious and ethnic groups live.
Aziz says there is no longer any trust between them and a number of the neighbouring villages from where some joined ISIL. "I personally don't see much of a future for us or our future generations here," said Aziz.
Amid the vast plains here, Peshmerga Private Ali and colleagues look at the villages far off in the distance where columns of black smoke are arising just as military operations there ended.
The slim fighter, who manned a heavy-calibre machine-gun, has been in the thick of the fight here and is still covered in dust head to toe. He is euphoric about the success and says this is the beginning of the return of life to this area. "We will advance beyond the current lines," he said as he points east toward Mosul. "Then this area will become safe and people can return to their homes."
Although no accurate figures are available, over the past couple of years many members of religious minorities such as Kakais, Shabaks and Yazidis left the country for destinations in the west.
"For many of us, there is nothing left to go back to," said Aziz.
Olympus took place over Halloween weekend. It was primarily a Project:M major, but also featured a great deal of Melee and Sm4sh talent. It was my first big tournament since SmashCon, and I had high expectations for myself. I couldn't find a Melee teams partner, so I decided to take a leap and enter PM, Sm4sh, and Melee singles. Let's take it day by day!
Friday
The tournament didn't technically start until Saturday morning, but there were some exhibition tournaments planned for Friday. I was invited to compete in the PM 3.02 Top Player Crew Battle Exhibition, and also decided to enter Melee Low Tiers and the Melee Reverse Main Tournament. Everything was set to start at 5pm, so I made sure I rolled into Atlantic City at around 4pm to check in and get settled before heading to play. Unfortunately, everything got shifted back by about 1.5-2 hours so we ended up just playing friendlies for a while. Eventually, Melee Low Tiers started and it ran pretty smoothly. There weren't many entrants, and it wasn't being streamed, so it was easy. 1st place was Strong Bad, I got 2nd, and Drephen's Roy got 3rd. I played mostly DK, but wasn't ready for Strong Bad in the DK ditto… he definitely had a better grasp on the punish-game flow-chart than I did. My Zelda and Pichu put up good fights as well, but it wasn't enough.
The PM 3.02 exhibition was then canceled because other players were coming late, so all that was left was the Reverse Main Tournament. I thought people would get hyped for the side events, and that there would be some good competition. I was wrong, unfortunately, so I decided to drop out. This was largely because of how late everything had been pushed back, and I didn't want to be competing in a free tournament with no competition at 1am the night before bracket actually started.
Friday was a bit all over the place, but I at least got to sit down and play a good amount of friendlies with DruggedFox and Drephen. DruggedFox beat me for the most part, which was a good wake-up call. He called out all of my tricky recoveries and played an extremely solid neutral. I also learned that the rumors about Drephen's spotdodging with Sheik are not unfounded in the slightest! He said he uses it mostly for conditioning and mixups, but if Marth spaces outside of Sheik's tilt and grab range, the spotdodges aren't very threatening. I'd just played Plank in the matchup at Xanadu in the couple weeks prior, and I think he had a better understanding of the intricacies in the matchup – notably how to utilize short-hop mixups. If Sheik spotdodges, then she isn't doing enough to counteract Marth's Dtilt.
I was back in my room and ready for bed before 1am, which was pretty decent timing. Unfortunately, pools were not finalized until 12:30am. This was a major problem, in my opinion. I believe that you shouldn't worry too much about who you're playing in bracket or you risk overthinking player matchups when you should just focus on playing your best… but when you're at a tournament of this caliber, it is reasonable to expect that skill and regional seeding will be completed by a reasonable amount of time before the tournament starts. I don't think that less-than-10-hours before the tournament starts falls into that category.
They actually had released pools earlier that week, which confused a great deal of people. They stated that pools weren't final, but I had to wonder why pools weren't final. They got MikeHaze and Redd to seed Melee, but that could have been done days in advance over Skype or Discord. I heard some criticisms from locals that they didn't put enough effort into seeding NYC locals for skill and regional dispersion.
Saturday
(I'm going to deviate slightly from the chronology here so as not to break up my discussion of seeding issues.)
I kept hearing that the TOs would be reseeding the bracket after round 1 pools. That is to say that round 1 pools would be completed, and then the TOs would take each person that made it into top 32 and individually re-seed. To me, this was a ludicrous idea. If you have to re-seed people for skill and region in the top 32 brackets, that means your initial seeding was garbage. The bracket should be seeded in the very beginning, placed into bracket-running software like on smashgg, and then the TOs should be hands-off. Let the bracket play out with the seeding you agreed upon in the first place.
If there are major regional conflicts, that means there could have been an upset somewhere in bracket. But that's how it works out sometimes. I'd rather maintain the integrity of the bracket – this integrity is, of course, reliant upon good initial seeding.
All of that being said, the TOs did not ultimately re-seed for top 32. But there was no confirmation that re-seeding would not occur until very soon before top 32 actually started, so nobody knew for certain who they would be playing against. This is kind of frustrating as a competitor. While I think it can be harmful to focus too much on who you're up against next, and it is far more useful to focus on playing your best, it is reasonable to expect some amount of time and information to prepare to compete.
Someone mentioned that PM was re-seeded, but I wasn't paying too close attention so I can't really comment on that. If that was the case… I think that's dumb. TOs: make your seeding good right off the bat, and finish it at least a week prior to the event.
Oh! I should mention that one issue with this event was that at-the-door signups for Melee and Sm4sh were open until Friday night before the tournament starts. This was, of course, a major reason that the TOs procrastinated on seeding. I personally prefer the “death pool” clause for at-the-door signups, though. Or to not allow door signups at all. TOs should be firm with their expectations of competitors, and these days, signing up for a tournament ahead of and on time is the standard. Don't diminish the ability of your signed-up competitors to prepare in order to gain 5 or 10 more entrants the night before bracket.
There could certainly be worse issues at a tournament than these I have described, there is no doubt. But in the age of professionalism in esports, some of these occurrences rubbed me and other competitors the wrong way.
And now let's jump back to Saturday morning! I played Melee first, then had Sm4sh pools, then Project:M. I made it out in winners for Melee, with one close call against CIZ. My play was not looking clean at all games 1 and 2, but I took it with a 3-stock on game 3. My round 1 in sm4sh didn't show up, so I had to play Biddy. Biddy and I played a long time ago, back when I played Rosalina. I believe I beat him in a clutch set, winning the game with a Rosa Uair kill at 45%. I got a lot of hate on YouTube for that, but I personally thought it was hilarious. This time, I thought about playing Rosa again for Gravitational Pull, but I haven't practiced her in over a year so I stuck with my Kirby guns. I lost game 1 on Smashville, and ran it back. I tried to play it safe and get a read on his patterns, then make hard reads to get openings and win the up-close mix-ups. It worked for both games 2 and 3, and I made it into top 32 winning only one game.
I was set to play Larry Lurr in round 1 of sm4sh top 32, a match I was excited to play. I've always admired Larry's skill, and wanted my shot at beating him. I should mention that, prior to this event, I was officially “retired” from sm4sh (as of March 2016). When I couldn't find a Melee partner for teams, however, I decided to practice for the couple weeks leading up to the event. So I didn't have any major expectations, but the tech barrier in the game is pretty low and I believe I have the mental game of a top player.
I played Kirby against Larry, naturally. Kirby versus Fox is a hilarious matchup in which Kirby crouches everything and then gets a 0-40% combo off one Utilt. I Utilt combo'd him, took his ability, shot lasers, crouched a bunch, played some footsies, and then Kirbycided him for the 2-stock. He switched off to DK for game 2, which I expected. I was outplaying him for a bit, getting DK to high %, but then got grabbed at 50% twice and died both times (Ding Dong). Game 3, I took him to Duck Hunt and he switched to Metaknight, a less polished character of his. I died early, unsure how to DI out of MK's Uair UpB combo, but then played the rest of the game safe. I was winning most exchanges, I think, which resulted in an inch-by-inch comeback. It was, however, too little and too late. I was fishing for a grab under the tree (I was at 130%, he was at 65%), to get an Uthrow kill, but I forgot he had the same trick and let myself get killed by it. In losers I beat a Cloud with Sheik, then lost to a Mewtwo with Lucario.
Meanwhile, I played my first set in PM against Robfox. We Mewtwo ditto'd on Stadium 2 twice, and I beat him 2-0. Then I forfeited. I was focused on Sm4sh top 32 matches, and I was warming up Melee in-between games.
I played Slox first in Melee top 32. He beat me 2-0 at Pound in Marth vs. Sheik, and he did the same thing here. For some reason, and I can't really say why, I was getting very tilted during our set. This doesn't usually happen to me – I like to think one of my strengths is keeping my cool in tense situations. In this set, though, I was just getting frustrated and irritated. I remember getting a phantom tipper at one point, and that sealed the deal. After that set, I thought to myself “I don't want to play Melee right now.” More specifically, I didn't feel like playing Marth. This was very unusual, and hadn't happened before.
I played G$ immediately afterward, and lost to his Falco on Battlefield and Marth on FD. I was very unhappy with how I played Melee all day, and I left the venue at this point. I was frustrated and needed to take a walk and lie down for a bit. I've gotten frustrated at losses before, but I never felt the way I did that day where I didn't feel like playing my matches. It was very unusual.
And that led to an epiphany: having fun is pretty important. Seems like a given, right? Melee is the most fun game of all time. But I think, at some point in the last month, training and playing with Marth in matchups I didn't like started to feel like a chore, and I couldn't muster up the motivation and positivity to do the best I could. The rest of that day, I played whoever I felt like playing. Mostly Fox, Sheik, Peach, Falco and the like.
I actually ended up entering teams because Wenbo was out of a teammate. We did alright, beating Zealous5000 and CIZ round 1, then losing to DJ and The Moon. I forget what team we played, because we tried so many, but I think our default was double Fox. I may have tried Peach against DJ and Moon. Then we beat Silver and Darc in losers, with double Fox I think, and lost to Drephen and dizzkidboogie.
So that was the end of smash for the day. I didn't like feeling so negative about the game and Marth, but playing whoever I wanted to the rest of the day really helped. Sometimes you've got to sit back and just enjoy the game. We had a dope dinner at a burger bar later, and then I turned in early to get some sleep.
Sunday
I was planning on leaving pretty early. I checked out, put my stuff in my car, then went back to the venue to chill for a bit and then head out. I just wanted to get back and not worry about smash anymore… but then dizzkidboogie asked if I'd give him Marth practice for his set against The Moon. So we started playing, and we kept playing, and I was having fun again (even though it was Marth versus Ice Climbers!!). I felt a twinge of guilt giving practice against my buddy The Moon, but Dizz is my friend also and I don't usually turn people away when they ask for help. Plus it was super fun.
I consider myself to be pretty good at the Marth versus ICs matchup, having been exposed to it a great deal over the past year and a half with Nintendude. At least, until he moved away to NorCal. Dizz also showed me a few tricks I hadn't been utilizing, like the fact that in a handoff scenario, you should always mash when Nana grabs because she pummels a random number of times! We broke down the neutral of the matchup into stages, and also looked at the intricacies. I taught him that Fthrow pivot Fsmash is never guaranteed as Marth if you DI it correctly, and showed him a couple things that Nintendude and ChuDat have done against me that worked.
If you have trouble fighting Ice Climbers, practice against Ice Climbers players and ask them to wobble you. I know a lot of players tend to get frustrated while they're being wobbled, but if you are more used to it after playing in friendlies, it doesn't feel as bad when you get down to it in tournament.
He went on to 3-0 The Moon and win the whole tournament. It was a major win for him, getting 1st over the likes of The Moon, Lucky, HugS, Professor Pro, and many more! So Kyle, if you're reading this, congrats again. ;]
Before I finish, there was one other big criticism I had: the TOs were far too loud over the microphone. When you have a half-size ballroom packed with people and the microphone turned all the way up, you do not need to swallow the mic and scream. It was intrusively loud, and I had to put in earphones just to muffle the noise so I could focus on my matches. But again, there could have been far worse issues with a tournament like this, so I still give props to all the organizers and TOs.
That pretty much sums up the story of my weekend at Olympus in Atlantic City. It started off pretty rocky, then I felt pretty awful about how I played, had a realization that I needed to rediscover the fun I have with the game, then had a ton of fun playing, and then drove home on Sunday evening.
Since Olympus, I haven't been sitting and grinding too much, but I've been having fun while competing. I've been playing mostly Fox, and got 1st at the last three tournaments I entered. I don't know if I'll switch to using more Fox than I have in the past, or if I'll keep him in the pocket, but I do know that I'm having fun with him. I'm also using Marth when it makes sense, such as when a spacie takes me to FD, or I fight Ice Climbers or Puff.
Anyways, it's very unusual for me to publish two posts so close together! But I'd like to be updating the bl0g more frequently, so if you like this sort of thing, you can follow my bl0g (in the bottom-right hand corner of the page) to get updates! I don't expect people to read these things all the way through, because of how lengthy they are. But for those of you who do, I hope you enjoy reading about my experiences and maybe learn a thing or two about the game or about competing, or just about me as a person and competitor.
That's all for now!

“Safety should be our north star,” said Seleta Reynolds, the Los Angeles Transportation Department's general manager. “So many people are being injured and killed. It's an invisible impact on families and on our city.”
Using data collected from reports that law enforcement agencies send to the California Highway Patrol, The Times analyzed more than 665,000 traffic accidents in L.A. County from 2002 through 2013 and identified 579 intersections in Los Angeles where the reported rate of crashes between cars and pedestrians was significantly higher than the county average.
Downtown L.A. The largest number of problematic intersections for pedestrians are in Downtown L.A. a Times analysis shows. The area has 48 dangerous intersections, almost as many as Koreatown and Westlake combined.
Many of the city's intersections have never seen a pedestrian accident. But among those that have, a tiny fraction of crossings has recorded an outsized number of crashes.
Resurgent downtown Los Angeles has the highest concentration of those intersections, The Times found. More than 600 people on foot were hit by cars at 48 intersections over those 12 years, or an average of one person per week. Eleven people were killed.
In Westlake, near MacArthur Park, 343 pedestrians were struck and three were killed in an area of less than one square mile.
In Koreatown, near the nexus of two Metro rail lines, more than 400 people on foot were hit by cars over the same period, 11 of them fatally.
“There's this perception — not just in Los Angeles, but in other major cities — that nobody walks,” said Janette Sadik-Khan, a former New York City transportation commissioner who is now a principal at Bloomberg Associates, which advises cities on quality-of-life issues. “That's not only an inaccurate, but a deadly perception.”
The data also showed that some of Hollywood's iconic boulevards — Hollywood, Sunset, Santa Monica — are perilous for pedestrians: 369 people were hit by cars at 23 intersections that The Times identified as dangerous. Eight people died.

At Hollywood Boulevard and Highland Avenue, just outside the TCL Chinese Theater, 38 pedestrians were hit by cars, and one was killed. Traffic is notoriously slow there, and experts say newer crosswalks and traffic signals help keep pedestrian incidents from happening even more frequently. But the throngs of people on foot, many of them tourists, who crowd the sidewalks make safety improvements paramount.
“The streets should be designed for people who are completely unfamiliar with them,” Ryan Snyder, a transportation planner and UCLA professor, said as he watched traffic at the busy intersection.
Moments later, a woman stepped off the curb next to Ripley's Believe It or Not and snapped a selfie in the crosswalk, a Hollywood Boulevard street sign behind her.
Pedestrians cross the intersection of Slauson Ave. and Western Ave. More pedestrians were recorded as being hit at or near Slauson and Western than any other intersection in the county. (Gina Ferazzi / Los Angeles Times)
In this area of Hollywood, Snyder said, adding so-called curb extensions would improve safety. Bumping the corners of the sidewalk farther out into the street could eliminate a lane of traffic — an unpopular proposition among harried L.A. drivers — but would reduce pedestrians' crossing distance. Using what was formerly the right-hand travel lane, he said, officials could add bicycle lanes, bigger bus stops or more street parking.
One consolation for drivers: Restriping the street can sometimes lead to more efficient traffic movement. “Two good traffic lanes work better than three bad ones,” particularly when cities add turn lanes and improve intersection design to reduce crashes, Sadik-Khan said.
Only one intersection in Los Angeles County saw more pedestrian crashes than Hollywood and Highland. At Slauson and Western avenues in South Los Angeles, 41 people were hit by cars over the 12-year period.
“There is so much work to be done here,” Deborah Murphy, an urban planner who runs Los Angeles Walks, a pedestrian advocacy group, said as she surveyed the streets on a recent afternoon. The wide intersection, anchored by three strip malls and a gas station, felt like a highway: Cars sped through it, and vehicles leaving parking lots narrowly zipped past children on bikes and old women with wire carts.
Hollywood Covering roughly the area bordered by Hollywood Blvd., Sunset Blvd., Vine St., and Highland Ave., 23 Hollywood intersections saw 369 people hit by cars, including eight deaths.
Away from L.A.'s congested core, wide streets like these can invite speeding or rapid lane changes. Adding taller buildings or trees that arch into the roadway could narrow drivers' field of view, Murphy said, adding more shade for pedestrians and subconsciously signaling drivers to slow down.
Another factor that makes Slauson and Western so dangerous, Murphy said, is that pedestrians must cross five lanes of traffic, or about 70 feet, to reach the opposite corner.
“That's a long way for an able-bodied person,” Murphy said. “Now think about people who do it in a wheelchair.”
At each corner of the intersection, one ramp points people with wheelchairs or strollers into the middle of the intersection. The better, but more expensive option, Murphy said, would be to add one ramp at each crosswalk. The city also could install sharper curbs that force drivers to brake as they turn, she said.
Only about 3% of the pedestrian accidents from 2002 through 2013 were fatal, according to the analysis. But even less-severe crashes can take a major toll.
On a warm summer afternoon four years ago, Azurell Papka, then a 32-year-old IT specialist who walked and took the bus to work, stepped out of her office in North Hollywood as the sunlight began to fade.
The walk signal flashed at Magnolia Boulevard, and she began to cross. A Toyota Corolla made a right turn into the crosswalk and knocked Papka's legs out from under her, throwing her to the ground and tearing her rotator cuff. After several surgeries to repair her shoulder and wrist, Papka sued the Corolla driver and settled out of court.
With the money she paid her hospital bills — then bought a car.
“I still get nervous there,” Papka said of the intersection. “There's been at least one death on that corner. I'm just thankful it wasn't me.”

After decades of urging the city to improve pedestrian infrastructure, advocates say they are finally seeing incremental changes.
Mayor Eric Garcetti's office said officials will introduce in August a plan aimed at eliminating all traffic deaths by 2025, a “Vision Zero” policy that mirrors initiatives in New York, San Francisco and several European cities.
Downtown, some traffic signals have been re-timed to give pedestrians a head start, and a lane of traffic on Broadway has been replaced with umbrellas and outdoor seating to encourage walking and slower driving.
Analysts used five years of data to create “crash profiles” of city corridors. That will help officials decide how to spend their limited budget where it counts, the Transportation Department's Reynolds said, to alleviate the “public health crisis” of traffic deaths.
Knowing that most crashes at a certain crosswalk involve right-hand turns, for example, could prompt a re-timed pedestrian countdown signal, giving walkers a several-second head start before cars can turn into the crosswalk — a relatively easy and cheap way to make people on foot more visible to drivers. Other intersections may benefit from speed feedback signs or high-visibility crosswalks.
But where intersection transformations will happen in Los Angeles, and how that work could be funded, remain unclear.
Installing high-visibility crosswalks, with wide stripes and bright paint, costs an average of $2,500 in Los Angeles. Overhauling a street to add broader curbs, ramps or a median costs far more, particularly if the street must be reshaped to accommodate storm drains or higher curbs. In Pasadena and Long Beach, curb extensions cost between $20,000 and $120,000 per corner.
Koreatown Koreatown doesn't just have a large number of pedestrian accidents, it has a large number of all types of crashes. More than 400 people on foot were hit at 29 Koreatown intersections, 11 of them fatal.
The city could also look to San Francisco for inspiration. Officials there recently moved to ban turns onto a mile-long stretch of Market Street to reduce conflict points between drivers, walkers and cyclists.
In the San Fernando Valley, which has a reputation for street racing, police are stopping drivers and warning them about speeding. “The stop is just as valuable as the cite,” Los Angeles Police Department Capt. John McMahon told commanders at a recent meeting.
In tandem with education and enforcement, reducing speed limits also can significantly reduce severe injuries and deaths, particularly near crosswalks without traffic lights, said Brian Tefft, a senior research associate at the AAA Foundation for Traffic Safety.
Last fall, New York officials reduced the speed limit from 30 mph to 25 mph on 90% of city streets. The change sounds marginal, Tefft said, but it's designed to help pedestrians survive a crash.
At greater speeds, pedestrians are more likely to hit the windshield or be thrown through the air. Bones and organs can't withstand the impact of steel and glass. Pedestrians face a 25% chance of severe injury if they are hit by a car driving 23 mph, Tefft said. The risk rises to 75% if the car is going just 16 mph faster.
One more hurdle is the court of public opinion. Drivers often bristle at the idea of losing lanes of traffic. But, advocates say, weighing safety against traffic flow is a false equivalence.
“The common way to think about this is, we don't want to do anything that compromises car movement,” UCLA's Snyder said. “But is it more important to save yourself 10 seconds as you drive, or to save lives?”

Hillary Clinton's Deceptive Blame-Shifting
Robert PARRY
Hillary Clinton has grown even more insistent that she was not at fault for her stunning election defeat last November, claiming that 1,000 Russian “agents” and their American collaborators were a decisive factor, a bizarre twist that further locks the Democrats into their evidence-light “Russia-gate” obsession.
Hillary Clinton at the Code 2017 conference on May 31, 2017
In comments at a California technology conference on Wednesday, Clinton also repeated one of her favorite falsehoods – that all 17 U.S. intelligence agencies unanimously concluded that Russia hacked Democratic emails and ran a covert influence campaign against her.
Referring to a report released by President Obama's Director of National Intelligence (DNI) on Jan. 6, Clinton asserted that “Seventeen agencies, all in agreement, which I know from my experience as a Senator and Secretary of State, is hard to get. They concluded with high confidence that the Russians ran an extensive information war campaign against my campaign, to influence voters in the election. They did it through paid advertising we think; they did it through false news sites; they did it through these thousand agents; they did it through machine learning, which you know, kept spewing out this stuff over and over again. The algorithms that they developed. So that was the conclusion.”
But Clinton's statement is false regarding the unanimity of the 17 agencies and misleading regarding her other claims. Both former DNI James Clapper and former CIA Director John Brennan acknowledged in sworn testimony last month that the Jan. 6 report alleging Russian “meddling” did not involve all 17 agencies.
Clapper and Brennan stated that the report was actually the work of hand-picked analysts from only three agencies – the Central Intelligence Agency, National Security Agency and Federal Bureau of Investigation – under the oversight of the DNI's office. In other words, there was no consensus among the 17 agencies, a process that would have involved some form of a National Intelligence Estimate (or NIE), a community-wide effort that would have included footnotes citing any dissenting views.
Instead, as Clapper testified before a Senate Judiciary subcommittee on May 8, the Russia-hacking claim came from a “special intelligence community assessment” (or ICA) produced by selected analysts from the CIA, NSA and FBI, “a coordinated product from three agencies – CIA, NSA, and the FBI – not all 17 components of the intelligence community,” the former DNI said.
And, as Clapper explained, the “ICA” was something of a rush job beginning on President Obama's instructions “in early December” and completed by Jan. 6. Clapper continued: “The two dozen or so analysts for this task were hand-picked, seasoned experts from each of the contributing agencies.”
However, as any intelligence veteran will tell you, if you hand-pick the analysts, you are really hand-picking the conclusion since the agency chiefs would know who was, say, a hardliner on Russia and who could be trusted to deliver the desired product.
On May 23, in testimony before the House Intelligence Committee, former CIA Director John Brennan confirmed Clapper's account about the three agencies involved.
“It wasn't a full inter-agency community assessment that was coordinated among the 17 agencies, and for good reason because of the nature and the sensitivity of the information trying, once again, to keep that tightly compartmented,” Brennan said.
In other words, Clinton's beloved claim that all 17 intelligence agencies were in agreement on the Russian “hacking” charge – an assertion that the “fact-checking” group Politifact has certified as “true” and that has been repeated endlessly by the mainstream U.S. news media – is not true. It is false. Gee, you might even call it “fake news.”
The Mysterious ‘Agents'
But Clinton's false claim about the intelligence consensus was not her only dubious assertion. Her reference to the 1,000 Russian “agents” is not contained in the Jan. 6 report, either. It apparently derived from unconfirmed speculation from Sen. Mark Warner, D-Virginia, who mentioned this claim at a news conference on March 30, admitting that he didn't know if it was true.

Warner, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, said: “We know about the hacking, and selective leaks, but what really concerns me as a former tech guy is at least some reports – and we've got to get to the bottom of this – that there were upwards of a thousand internet trolls working out of a facility in Russia, in effect taking over a series of computers which are then called botnets, that can then generate news down to specific areas.
“It's been reported to me, and we've got to find this out, whether they were able to affect specific areas in Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania, where you would not have been receiving off of whoever your vendor might have been, Trump versus Clinton, during the waning days of the election, but instead, ‘Clinton is sick', or ‘Clinton is taking money from whoever for some source' … fake news.”
Of course, many stories about Clinton being sick or her taking money from special interests weren't “fake news.” In late 2012, she suffered from a blood clot and – during the 2016 campaign – she was staggered by a bout of pneumonia. She also was paid hundreds of thousands of dollars for speeches to Wall Street and other groups.
Warner didn't specify where his information about the “trolls” came from but it paralleled a claim by freelance journalist Adam Chen who asserted in a podcast with Longform that Russian “trolls” began writing favorably about Trump in late 2015. (The CIA/FBI/NSA report also apparently alluded to the same report without mentioning the name of the journalist or specifying the number of alleged “trolls.”)
“I created this list of Russian trolls when I was researching,” Chen said, referring to a 2015 reporting project that he turned into a rather thinly sourced New York Times Magazine article accusing a Russian oligarch of funding a professional “troll” operation in St. Petersburg, Russia. “I check on it once in a while, still. And a lot of them have turned into conservative accounts, like fake conservatives. I don't know what's going on, but they're all tweeting about Donald Trump and stuff.”
Although such “troll” and “hacking” complaints are treated as a one-way street – coming only from the evil Russians – the reality is that U.S. intelligence agencies, their allies and U.S.-government-funded “non-governmental organizations” have mounted similar operations against Russia and other targets.
It is always difficult to nail down precisely where such operations are originating, but the Russians have cited previous cases of malicious hacking aimed at senior officials, including Prime Minister Dmitri Medvedev, whose accounts were hacked in 2013 and 2014 including publication of a false resignation and a confession of wrongdoing.
In 2015, the “Panama Papers,” a vast trove of documents purloined from a Panamanian law firm, became an investigative project that involved a USAID-funded news outlet and led to attacks on President Vladimir Putin for corruption even though his name did not appear in the documents.
So, this high-tech spy-vs.-spy game – if that's what it is – does not appear to be originating entirely from the Russian side of the street. But the U.S. intelligence community is not going to divulge what it knows about the attacks against Russia, only what it can “assess” about Russia's possible attacks against Western targets.
No Self-Criticism
Neither, of course, are Hillary Clinton and the Democratic Party eager to engage in a serious self-criticism about how they managed to blow an extremely winnable race against an extraordinarily flawed candidate in Donald Trump. Rather than look at their own missteps and misjudgments, they are presenting themselves as innocent victims.

In Wednesday's interview – after misrepresenting what the Jan. 6 report actually said – Clinton suggested that the Trump campaign must have colluded with the Russians in “weaponizing” the data.
“How did they know what messages to deliver?” Clinton asked. “Who told them? Who were they coordinating with, or colluding with? … [The Russians] were conveying this weaponized information and the content of it… So the Russians — in my opinion and based on the intel and the counterintel people I've talked to — could not have known how best to weaponize that information unless they had been guided. … Guided by Americans and guided by people who had polling and data information.”
Although Clinton lacked any proof of this convoluted accusation, she cited as her “best example” the fact that “within one hour, one hour of the ‘Access Hollywood' tapes being leaked [in which Trump was caught boasting about groping women], within one hour, the Russians — let's say WikiLeaks, something — dumped the John Podesta emails.”
However, if you changed the context of this claim slightly – and made a similar jump in logic – you would surely be labeled a nutty conspiracy theorist, but instead Clinton has drawn nods of agreement for this wholly unsubstantiated speculation.
Yet, besides blaming the Russians and WikiLeaks for her loss, Clinton spread the blame even wider, for instance, to The New York Times for focusing too much on her decision to use a private email server while Secretary of State – “they covered it like it was Pearl Harbor” – and for the Times' Nate Silver publishing optimistic odds on her chances for victory. “I also think I was the victim of a very broad assumption I was going to win,” she said.
Clinton also placed blame on the Democratic National Committee for lacking money and sophisticated technology. “I get the nomination. So I'm now the nominee of the Democratic Party. I inherit nothing from the Democratic Party,” she said. “I mean it was bankrupt; it was on the verge of insolvency; its data was mediocre to poor, nonexistent, wrong. I had to inject money into it.”
Yet, when Clinton was asked about some of her own “misjudgments,” she slipped back into the defensive posture that contributed to her troubles as a presidential candidate. For instance, regarding why she gave lucrative speeches to Goldman Sachs between her time leaving the State Department and announcing her White House run, she answered coyly, “They paid me.”
When pressed on the point, Clinton retreated behind the sanctity of the 9/11 terror attack and the issue of women's rights. Reminded that “you're not somebody who needed that money for the next week's shopping, and you knew you might run, so why do it?” – she responded:
“The most common thing that I talked about in all those speeches was the hunt for Bin Laden. You know, that was one of the central missions that I felt from the time the towers fell on 9/11 as a Senator from New York.”
Then, Clinton added, “you know, men got paid for the speeches they made. I got paid for the speeches I made. And it [the paid-speech issue] was used, and I thought it was unfairly used.”
Blocking Witnesses
So, while the Democrats dig themselves deeper into the so-far empty pit of blaming Russia for their electoral disaster, the Russia-gate investigation continues to take on other curious aspects, such as an unwillingness to hear from some of Donald Trump's advisers who have been named in accusations and who have volunteered to testify publicly.
Former Trump foreign policy adviser Carter Page
On Wednesday, Carter Page, a Navy veteran and businessman who had lived in Russia, announced that his plans to defend himself in testimony next week before the House Intelligence Committee had been placed on hold by the Democrats.
Rep. Adam Schiff of California, the ranking Democrat on the committee and a major sparkplug powering the investigation, offered a curious denial of Page's complaint while confirming the truth of it.
The New York Times, which has been another advocate for blaming Russia, phrased the postponement of Page's testimony as if Page were the unreasonable one, reporting:
“Representative Adam Schiff… dismissed accusations from Carter Page, another Trump adviser who is under scrutiny, that the committee is preventing him from testifying. Mr. Schiff... said the investigation would first review relevant documents before interviewing witnesses.”
In other words, Page, who has been portrayed via intelligence leaks to the news media as essentially a traitor, won't be given the opportunity to defend his reputation until Schiff and the other Democrats decide the time is ripe.
Yet, it's not as if the House Intelligence Committee has not taken public testimony about Russia-gate. For instance, former CIA Director Brennan was allowed to speak indirectly about Page and other possibly treasonous Americans amid media reports naming Page as one of those suspected Russian “agents.”
Normal investigations grant the people under attack at least the opportunity to defend themselves and their reputations in a timely fashion, rather than make them live under the cloud of suspicion without having a chance to state their case.
If their sworn testimony is later undermined by evidence developed by investigators, the witnesses can be called back and called out on possible perjury. So, it's not as if Schiff and the other Democrats are surrendering prerogatives by letting Page testify now rather than later. Indeed, Page would be putting himself in legal jeopardy if he is caught lying.
Even the Republican-driven “Benghazi investigation,” which also had the look of an over-the-top “witch hunt,” gave Secretary of State Clinton and other Obama administration officials multiple opportunities to explain their response to the Sept. 11, 2012 attack on the U.S. consulate.
But, so far, a similar courtesy has not been extended to the targets of the Russia-gate investigation.

The last line of the article "Netanyahu summons U.S. ambassador" (Dec. 24) says basically that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's actions made it easy for President Barack Obama to do what he did in declining to veto a United Nations resolution condemning Israeli settlement building.
I would argue that the Obama administration and the European countries created this mess with the settlements. They have not put pressure on Palestinian Prime Minister Mahmoud Abbas and others to come to the negotiating table as well as to stop teaching hate in their schools. Also where is the outrage that much of the aid money to Palestine goes to the pockets of Palestinian leaders and terrorists? Why have the UN and other Arab countries not helped the Palestinians create a real economy with jobs instead of giving no hope? Why doesn't your newspaper do an investigative story and report on those facts?

The country's well-known “encounter specialist” Daya Nayak was suspended on Thursday after the Mumbai police officer declined to join his new posting at Nagpur fearing his family's safety.
Best known for gunning down more than 80 Mumbai underworld gangsters in the 1990s, the officer has courted controversy several times in the past — especially when he was under scrutiny for allegedly amassing wealth disproportionate to his income.
Like millions of people from rural India, Nayak's journey began after finishing class 7 from a Kannada-medium school in his village and found himself in “big old Bombay” in 1979.
More than three decades down the road, the youngest son of Badda and Radha Nayak from a Karnataka village is one of Mumbai police's most feared, celebrated and controversial officers.
The portico of a hotel, where worked after landing in Mumbai, was his home and often he would sit under a streetlight with a book. His persistence paid as he completed his class 12 from a Goregaon school and his graduation from a college in Andheri.
Working as a plumber's apprentice after college, he met some officers from the narcotics department — a chance meeting that sowed the seeds of a life in uniform.
In 1995, he was posted at Juhu as a sub-inspector after completing training at the police academy.
From then on, Nayak's rise to fame was quick, chiefly helped by Mumbai's hyper-active underworld of the 90s. In December 1996, Nayak made his first kill — two Chotta Rajan gangsters at Juhu. The tally would reach 83 in the years to follow.
A coffee shop at Lokhandwala in Andheri (West) used to be his favourite hangout to meet journalists. The stocky officer in a tight shirt or a T-shirt would walk in and pull two weapons out — a .38 revolver and a 9mm pistol. He would sit on a chair from where the entire shop and people passing by on the road outside were visible. Fear, after all, was catching up on this fearless officer.
Nayak's charm waned after a probe was ordered against him for disproportionate assets in January 2002. He had built a school in his native village, Yennehole, and named it after his mother.
But what initiated the probe was the inauguration ceremony where some of the country's biggest celebrities were present — painter MF Husain, actors Amitabh Bachchan, Suniel Shetty and Aftab Shivdasani, besides then Karnataka education minister H Vishwanath.
The controversy faded after then police commissioner MN Singh endorsed Nayak as one of the best officers in the force.
It flared up again when a MCOCA court in 2004 asked the anti-corruption branch (ACB) to investigate his unaccounted wealth.
Raids at six places, including two in Bangalore, set tongues wagging. Nayak allegedly held a fleet of luxury buses operating from an Andheri office and another set at Karkala town in Karnataka.
The ACB arrested him and soon Nayak's alleged dirty laundry came out in the open — a penthouse in Malad, a flat worth R21 lakh gifted to his brother Keshav in Kandivali, Kancha bar and restaurant in Goregaon, a flat in Powai and Escape pub in Andheri.
The allegations couldn't be proven and Nayak was reinstated in 2012 as additional commissioner of police (West) control room.
He maintained a low profile, but continued to meet journalists. The only change was the venue, a gymnasium in Andheri West which he regularly visited to sate his thirst for fitness.
In 2014, when he was transferred to Nagpur, he refused. Nayak said he would be singled out and killed along with his family as the government had withdrawn the security cover.

The Phoenix Suns have smoothed out the last rough spot on their reconstructed roster by signing free agent center Jermaine O'Neal, The Arizona Republic's Paul Coro reports.
The 6-foot-11, 255-pound veteran most recently played for the Boston Celtics, where while not a mainstay in the lineup due to injury, he was still productive when he was on the court. He averaged 5.0 points and 5.4 rebounds in 22.8 minutes a game this past season, but O'Neal only appeared in 25 contests (24 starts) after undergoing wrist surgery.
The bigger injury issues for the big man are his knee problems. Drafted out of high school by the Portland Trail Blazers in 1996, the wear has taken its toll, and Coro reports that this summer O'Neal underwent the same German procedure in both of his knees that Grant Hill and Kobe Bryant had done. So cue the obligatory revitalization of a veteran by the Suns' training staff point.
But experience and shot blocking — in his limited minutes last year, O'Neal averaged 1.7 blocks a night — was one thing the new-era Suns needed the most. Though Phoenix will have a front line of Marcin Gortat and Luis Scola presumably starting in 2012-13, along with Markieff Morris and Channing Frye coming off the bench, O'Neal gives the Suns a defensive presence that will be needed.
Remember, Gortat only averaged 1.5 blocks a game in 32 minutes an outing this past season. Especially considering they'll be seeing a lot more of Dwight Howard, who was officially traded to the Los Angeles Lakers today, O'Neal should be the final piece to the puzzle as we look toward the season.
O'Neal becomes the 13th man on the Phoenix roster and as a six-time All-Star brings career averages of 13.7 points and 7.4 rebounds a night.
The Suns were supposedly offering a one-year, league-minimum deal, according to Coro.

Greenpeace activist Anne Mie Roer Jensen, the Danish member of the Arctic 30, will have to spend Christmas in St Petersburg after Russia's Investigative Committee ruled that she can't leave the country while awaiting trial.
While Jensen will be forced to remain in St Petersburg, Greenpeace Denmark spokesperson Jon Burgwald said the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea (ITLOS) has ruled that Jensen and the other non-Russian crew members should be allowed to go home.

"ITLOS made it crystal clear that Anne Mie and the 29 other crew members can go home until the case is settled," Burgwald told Politiken newspaper. "We are very displeased with the [Russian] ruling that completely contradicts that."
Jensen was among the 30 Greenpeace activists and freelance journalists who were arrested aboard the Arctic Sunrise and charged with piracy after their failed September 18 attempt to board a Gazprom oil rig in the Arctic Ocean.

While Russia reportedly dropped the piracy charges, she may still risk getting a seven-year prison sentence for hooliganism.
Still no trial in sight
The Russian authorities won't say when Jensen's case will be brought to trial. Burgwald called for Denmark to put pressure on Russia to give the activist permission to leave.
"It could take anything from 14 days to two years," Burgwald said, "If we don't put pressure on them, the crew members may be stuck there for years. What Russia is doing right now is against international law and Denmark has to react. It means that they are keeping a Danish citizen prisoner in a foreign country."

BRUSSELS/PARIS (Reuters) - Poland led EU criticism of bilateral farm deals with Moscow on Monday following a French accord with Russia to lift its ban on live pig and pork imports, saying they broke the "principle of European solidarity".
Pressure is mounting on the European Union to consider tougher sanctions on Russia following an upsurge in fighting in Ukraine. European Union foreign ministers will meet in emergency session on Thursday.
France, meanwhile, has said a ban on live pigs, offal and fat that was imposed by Moscow a year ago would be lifted for France in the coming weeks.
The EU-wide embargo followed an outbreak of African swine fever in the east of the EU and was separate from an embargo imposed by Moscow in August last year on food imports from Western countries, in response to U.S. and EU sanctions on Russia over its role in the Ukraine crisis.
Poland's Agriculture Minister Marek Sawicki in a letter, seen by Reuters, to his counterpart from Latvia, current holder of the rotating EU presidency, said he was "deeply disappointed" at the news of bilateral agreements with Russia.
A diplomat who asked not to be named said the Lithuanian prime minister would also write a letter objecting to bilateral deals.
"The pick and choose principle is dangerous. It allows Russia to divide and rule," the diplomat said.
A meeting of EU farm ministers in Brussels on Monday debated the issue after Poland led push for it to be on the agenda.
Diplomats and EU officials said the European Commission told the meeting trade policy had to be agreed by the bloc as a whole.
The Commission, the EU executive, is challenging Russia's ban on pig products in relation to African swine fever at the World Trade Organization.
But Commission officials said that still did not justify bilateral agreements with Russia, which had to be "based strictly on EU frameworks".
A spokesman for the French farm minister stressed that talks on the lifting of the embargo were purely technical and were done by veterinary services, not at a political level.
The ministry has said Russia represented a market of 100 million euros ($112 million) for French pig farmers.

For doctors specializing in the nipping and tucking of faces, the latest stats on plastic surgery might be a bit of a bummer.
While sagging cheeks are still a leading motivation for cosmetic surgery, new data (PDF) compiled by the American Society of Plastic Surgeons (ASPS) suggests a subtle tweak in the trends. In 2015, redesigning the derriere—not the face—was the fastest growing area of plastic surgery in the United States, the society found.
Specifically, butt implants and lifts showed the largest uptick in procedures over those done in 2014—both increasing by 36 percent. Backside bulking with fat grafts also rose by 28 percent. And surgeons were clearly working their tails off, performing more than 22,000 tushie operations—about one every 30 minutes over the year.
“While more traditional facial procedures and breast augmentations are still among the most popular, we're seeing much more diversity in the areas of the body patients are choosing to address,” ASPS President David H. Song said in a statement. The society also noted increases in lower body lifts and upper arm lifts.
But that isn't the bottom of revelations from the report; the data also suggests a rising trend in breast reductions in men. From 2014 and 2015, surgeries to shrink male breasts perked up by five percent. That brings men's share of all breast reduction surgeries to more than 40 percent, the ASPS noted.
“As plastic surgery is becoming more common and accepted in men, we're seeing more of them undergo procedures to tighten and tone problem areas, like the breasts,” Song said. “This procedure is often done in younger men who face genetic challenges with the size and shape of their breasts, and when appropriate, surgery can make a big difference in their lives.”
While the posterior procedures and male contributions were up-and-comers in 2015, the top five most common operations of the 1.7 million cosmetic surgeries performed last year were less surprising. They were, in order, breast augmentation, liposuction, nose reshaping, eyelid surgery, and tummy tucks. But for the first time since at least 2000, facelifts didn't make the cut.

THE monument to Soviet central planning was supposed to have been a heap of surplus left boots without any right ones to match them. The great bull market of the past quarter century is commemorated by millions of empty houses without anyone to buy them. Gosplan drafted workers into grim factories even if their talents had been better suited elsewhere. Finance beguiled the bright and ambitious and put them to work in the trading rooms of Wall Street and the City of London. Much of their effort was wasted. You can only guess at what else they might have achieved.
When the financial system fails, everyone suffers. Over the past 22 months the shock has spread from American housing, sector by sector, economy by economy. Some markets have seized up; others are being pounded by volatility. Everywhere good businesses are going bankrupt and jobs are being destroyed. For the first time since 1991 global average income per head is falling. Even as growth in emerging markets has come to a halt, the rich economies look set to shrink. Alan Greenspan, who as chairman of America's Federal Reserve oversaw the boom, calls the collapse “a once-in-a-half-century, probably once-in-a-century type of event”. Financial markets promised prosperity; instead they have brought hardship.
Financial services are in ruins. Perhaps half of all hedge funds will go out of business. Without government aid, so would many banks. Britain has suffered its first bank-run since Disraeli was prime minister in the 1870s. America has stumbled from one rescue to the next. The Wall Street grandees have been humbled. Hundreds of thousands of people in financial services will lose their jobs; many millions of their clients have lost their savings.
For a quarter of a century finance basked in a golden age. Financial globalisation spread capital more widely, markets evolved, businesses were able to finance new ventures and ordinary people had unprecedented access to borrowing and foreign exchange. Modern finance improved countless lives.
But more recently something went awry. Through insurance and saving, financial services are supposed to offer shelter from life's reverses. Instead, financiers grew rich even as their industry put everyone's prosperity in danger. Financial services are supposed to bring together borrowers and savers. But as lending markets have retreated, borrowers have been stranded without credit and savers have seen their pensions and investments melt away. Financial markets are supposed to be a machine for amassing capital and determining who gets to use it and for what. How could they have been so wrong?
Finance is increasingly fragile. Barry Eichengreen of the University of California at Berkeley and Michael Bordo of Rutgers University identify 139 financial crises between 1973 and 1997 (of which 44 took place in high-income countries), compared with a total of only 38 between 1945 and 1971. Crises are twice as common as they were before 1914, the authors conclude.
The paradox is that financial markets can function again only if this lesson is partly forgotten. Financial transactions are a series of promises. You hand your money to a bank, which promises to pay it back when you ask; you invest in a company, which promises you a share of its future profits. Money itself is just a collective agreement that a piece of paper can always be exchanged for goods or services.
Imagine, for a second, how finance began, with small loans within families and between trusted friends. As the circle of lenders and borrowers grew, financial transactions were able to muster larger sums and to spread risk, even as promises became harder to enforce. Paul Seabright, an economist at the University of Toulouse in France, observes that trust in a modern economy has evolved to the miraculous point where people give complete strangers sums of money they would not dream of entrusting to their next-door neighbours. From that a further miracle follows, for trust is what raises the billions of dollars that fund modern industry.
Trust's slow accumulation pushes financial markets forward; its shattering betrayal batters them back. Sometimes this is through bad faith, as when Bernie Madoff, a grand fund manager, allegedly made his investors $50 billion poorer, or mortgage-sellers tempted naive borrowers. But promises made in good faith can be broken too. Indeed, honest failure is even more corrosive of trust than outright criminality. Everyone understands that now.
The failure of finance will affect ideology, too. Many people find capitalism's central planner hard to put up with at the best of times. Free markets shun seemingly worthy causes, whereas the frivolous or apparently undeserving are rewarded. Look at the financial-services industry itself. In America middle-class pay has stalled in recent years but financiers have figured prominently among the tiny number of people who have captured much of the extra income. For as long as the world economy was growing fast, financial markets commanded grudging allegiance. Yet the same financiers who preached the necessity of free markets on the way up have since depended on taxpayers to save their industry at a cost of trillions of dollars.
Financiers will find the arguments for free markets harder to make now that they have lost the benefit of the doubt. Charles Kindleberger's classic study, “Manias, Panics and Crashes: A History of Financial Crises”, updated by Robert Aliber in 2005, suggests that financial instability feeds on itself. Japanese savings fled their own bust and sloshed first into the Nordic countries and then into Asia, which suffered contagion in 1997.
Some see today's disaster as a result of that Asian crash. Asian nations—especially China—have been determined to be part of global capital markets but not to run current-account deficits which would leave them vulnerable to sudden currency outflows. So they have been happy to see their money go abroad. In the phrase of Martin Wolf, an economic columnist at the Financial Times, they “smoke but do not inhale”.
In 2006 America's current-account deficit peaked at 6% of its GDP (see chart 1). Between 2000 and 2008 the country received over $5.7 trillion from abroad to invest, equivalent to over 40% of its 2007 GDP. Over the same period Britain and Ireland absorbed around a fifth of their 2007 GDPs and Spain a vast 50%. The financial system had the job of recycling the money to borrowers. Inevitably, credit became cheaper and savings declined. In America savings fell from around 10% of disposable income in the 1970s to 1% after 2005.
Not everyone agrees about the cause of this torrent of foreign capital. Although some blame Asian saving, others point to Western extravagance. But there is little doubt about the consequences. All four of the debtor countries in the chart enjoyed housing booms. Jeffry Frieden, a political economist at Harvard University, says about three-quarters of credit booms financed from abroad end up in crashes.
And yet financial services were not so much a victim of the inflows of foreign capital as an eager accomplice. The question is why financial systems are so liable to turn foreign credit into ruinous busts. In particular, why did America, home to the world's most advanced financial system, turn foreign credit into the world's most serious post-war bust?
The suspicion is that American know-how and talent made the disaster worse. Of all the financial instruments to have failed, newfangled collateralised-debt obligations (CDOs) have turned out to be among the most devastating. One way of thinking about CDOs, says Raghuram Rajan, a professor at the University of Chicago, is as a mechanism for converting mortgage securities and corporate bonds from huge, illiquid assets owned by local investors into liquid financial instruments that could be flogged across the world. Philip Lane, of Trinity College Dublin, thinks that sophisticated American financial services combined dangerously with relatively unsophisticated financial services elsewhere.
If the price of sophistication is instability, something is wrong. You might conclude that the thing to do is to shackle finance as it was shackled in the 1950s and 60s. If ever there were a moment for this, it would be now. It takes a big upheaval to open the way for radical reform. The structure of financial regulation in America still bears the mark of ideas forged in the Depression.
Reform is certainly needed, yet, for all the excesses and instability of finance, a complete clampdown would be a mistake. For one thing, remember the remarkable prosperity of the past 25 years. Finance deserves some of the credit for that. Note, too, that finance has always been plagued by crises, whether the system is open or closed, simple or sophisticated. Attempts to regulate finance to make it safe often lead to dangerous distortions as clever financiers work around the rules. If there were a simple way to prevent crises altogether, it would already be the foundation stone of financial regulation.
In fact, the aim should be neither to banish finance nor to punish it, but to create a system that supports economic growth through the best mix of state-imposed stability and private initiative. Modern finance is flawed, unstable and prone to excess. But think of those boots and those wasted lives: planned markets are flawed, unstable and excessive too.
Image caption Operation Elveden is linked to Operation Weeting, the investigation into phone hacking by journalists
Three people arrested as part of a Met Police investigation into alleged corrupt payments to public officials have been bailed until October.
The Met's Operation Elveden is running alongside a probe into phone hacking.
A Sun journalist, a 40-year old ex-prison officer from Corby, Northants and a 37-year-old woman were arrested on Thursday on suspicion of corruption.
Separately, a serving police officer was arrested on suspicion of passing unauthorised information to the media.
Alleged money laundering
A spokeswoman for News International has refused to confirm the identity of the journalist arrested, but said the person worked for the Sun.
Police said a 31-year-old man arrested in Croydon, south London, was held on suspicion of conspiracy to corrupt and conspiracy to cause misconduct in a public office.
He was questioned at a south London police station.
The former prison officer and 37-year-old woman were both arrested in Corby and questioned at a police station in Northamptonshire.
The former prison officer was asked about alleged misconduct in a public office and money laundering offences, while the woman was questioned on suspicion of aiding and abetting misconduct in a public office and money laundering.
The arrests bring the total made by Operation Elveden to 33.
The Met Police said in a statement that the arrests came after News Corporation's management standards committee provided information.
News Corporation set up its committee to conduct internal investigations relating to allegations of wrongdoing at its newspapers.
Scotland Yard's Operation Elveden investigation was set up to look into allegations of inappropriate payments to police and other public officials.
It is linked to Operation Weeting, the investigation into mobile phone hacking by journalists.
'Unauthorised information'
Meanwhile, officers from the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) questioned a superintendent with City of London Police on suspicion of misconduct in a public office.
He was arrested after Met officers from Operation Elveden passed information about him to the IPCC.
In a statement, the IPCC said the arrest related "to the alleged passing of unauthorised information to a journalist".
The officer was being held in custody at a London police station.
It has also emerged that Guardian journalist David Leigh will not be prosecuted over his admission that he hacked the voicemail of an arms company executive.
The Crown Prosecution Service said that although the police investigation was not complete, its view was that Mr Leigh should not be charged.
Mr Leigh, the newspaper's investigations executive editor, said he got a "voyeuristic thrill" from listening to the voicemail messages.
He made the admission in an article after former News of the World royal reporter Clive Goodman pleaded guilty in December 2006 to intercepting voicemail messages left on royal aides' phones.
Media playback is not supported on this device Re-live GB's Davis Cup journey
Andy Murray says talking to the Lawn Tennis Association about the future of British tennis is a waste of his time.
The world number two inspired Great Britain to win the Davis Cup for the first time in 79 years with victory over Belgium in Ghent over the weekend.
Captain Leon Smith urged the LTA to use that triumph to inspire future players, but Murray, 28, said he "did not know where the next generation are".
"Nothing ever gets done and I don't like wasting my time," he said.
The Scot added he has not discussed the lack of young British players competing in Grand Slams with LTA chief executive Michael Downey.
Media playback is not supported on this device I can't believe we won the Davis Cup - Andy Murray
"I don't speak to any of the people who are in a high-up position about that," Murray revealed. "I haven't really spoken to them about anything.
"It's concerning not to have any juniors in the Grand Slams because that is something we were always very good at. It's not ideal."
Downey earlier said Britain's Davis Cup win was a "special, emotional moment" that could drive interest in the sport.
Before the final in Ghent, Murray was criticised by former Great Britain Davis Cup captain David Lloyd for not putting enough back into the game.
"I'd rather concentrate on my own stuff and when I've finished playing, I'll have a lot more time to try and help or give back to the game," Murray added.
"Just now, I've just got to concentrate on trying to win as much as possible."
'There are no people there'
Murray said one of his main frustrations was a lack of players to practise with whenever he is in the UK.
After returning from the Shanghai Masters in October, Murray said he arrived at the National Training Centre in London to find no other players present.
"I was there on a Monday at about 3pm and then on Tuesday, at the same time," he said.
"There was not one person using any of the indoor courts and not one person in the gym. I took photos of it because the place cost like £40m and there are no people."
BBC Sport tennis correspondent Russell Fuller "Andy Murray's frustrations with the LTA date back many years, and he currently sees an alarming lack of juniors with the potential to inspire future generations. Katie Swan is one notable exception, but while France - home of Roland Garros - has 10 men in the top 100, Britain - home of Wimbledon - has two, and Aljaz Bedene was playing for Slovenia this time last year. "Sport England has recently complimented the LTA for putting 'increasing participation at the heart of its strategy', but the high performance side is a mess. There will not be a permanent performance director in place until after next year's Olympics and the other concern about the National Tennis Centre is the quality of the courts. Players have been reluctant to use the clay courts there because they are worried about the risk of injury."
'Judy can't keep doing it on her own'
Prior to Murray's comments, Smith said the LTA needed to quickly create a long-term strategy to capitalise on his team's victory.
Smith also praised Judy Murray's tennis programmes but said the mother of British number one Andy and doubles specialist Jamie "needs a lot of help".
"She can't keep doing it on her own," he added.

Murray leads the LTA's Miss-Hits programme - an introductory course for girls aged between five and eight - and a Scottish-based scheme, Tennis on the Road.
Smith, who became Davis Cup captain five years ago with the team a play-off away from relegation to the event's lowest tier, added: "At the end of the day, we all care about British tennis a lot.
"What we want to see is more people playing, so there should be a bigger talent pool in years to come.
"It really is an important time to get strategies rolled out as quickly as possible, not only to get people on the court but to keep them on the court. We need to offer them good clubs and good coaches that turn up in all weather and bang out great sessions. Let's hope it has a positive influence, because it should do."
The LTA was criticised for failing to capitalise on Murray's Wimbledon victory in 2013 with participation levels falling in the aftermath.
But LTA chief Downey said the coverage created by Britain's successful weekend in Belgium should help "encourage participation".
In the most recent figures released by Sport England, for the six months up to March 2015, tennis participation was up.
Square Enix have completed their official website for the Kingdom Hearts 10th Anniversary Fan Selection -Melodies & Memories- soundtrack. This update is an update to the track listing page, which now includes a comment from Yoko Shimomura, as well as "Fantasia alla marcia for piano, chorus and orchestra" and the bonus track of the disc-- Twinkle Twinkle Holidays from Drammatica: The Very Best of Yoko Shimomura.

Our translator goldpanner has translated each of the new comments, and these translations can be read below.
“Well, thank you so much for following along and reading my drawn-out poor writing for this long.Writing detailed individual comments isn't my usual attitude, but your voices saying you wanted to read stories of memories from during production and explanations of the compositions and such reached me, so I challenged myself to do it this way this time.When I first started writing I did feel lost for a bit, but as the updates increased, I heard many happy voices of people who were looking forward to it, and people who wanted to read more, and such.Thank you so much! Thanks to you, even though this is later than we first planned (sweatmark), I was able to finish writing these right to the end.It's after release, and I hear that sales are going well.To everyone who pre-ordered or purchased it without delay, and to everyone who voted in the poll, I am so very grateful. Thank you so much.If I get the chance, I would like to try writing comments like these again. Next is... the 20th anniversary!? Well, we'll just have to go that long (haha).Lastly, to the people who have helped me with such powerful, warm support these ten years, Square Enix's Mr Kawamori, Mr Noda, Mr Yamazaki, Mr Ishimoto, Mr Sekito, and, Mr Tetsu, all the project managers, everyone in the team, all the production staff, everyone in PR, and, and, there are too many to write here, so many many many people who have supported me and made me able to write as many songs as I have. Thank you so, so, soooooooooo much!And, to you, looking at this comment now, here is love and gratitude from my heart.Thanks for 10th Anniversary!!"
Fantasia alla marcia for piano, chorus and orchestra: As the music used during the credits for KHII, this song is march-style + melody made from phrases from various themes-style. Just as with the credits music from the first title, the 'march-style' part was a request from Mr Tetsu. Actually, at first, when I heard "do a march", I thought, "Huh? Why a march!??". But, when you really think about what 'march' means, there is this bright cheery imagery of '(all the staff together) moving ahead, moving onwards'. I feel that is very fitting for the credits for Kingdom Hearts. Onwards, onwards, believing there is definitely a bright future ahead. --Yoko Shimomura
Twinke Twinkle Holidays: Finally, the last comment I will write (that's a bit lonely... ;
This last track is a bonus track taken from 'drammatica -The Very best of Yoko Shimomura-', released in 2008. On this album were four tracks from the Kingdom Hearts series, but the other three made the ranking, and apart from parts of songs used in the medley, had already been recorded as original songs. And so, by process of elimination (haha), we went with this song, which had not been recorded as an original song. The track is a medley of the battle theme for Christmas Town in 'Kingdom Hearts II Final Mix +', and the theme for the flying part in the Neverland stage in 'Kingdom Hearts'. Game-wise there isn't any connection. However, when we were choosing the tracks for the 'drammatica' compilation, I decided, let's go with these two tracks as a medley! These two tracks are, to me, the 'symbol of happiness in Kingdom Hearts'. Exciting! Fun! Happy!! Don't those feelings come through in these songs~~?? They do, right~!? Tell me they do~~~!! (haha.) I wanted to end this 'Kingdom Hearts 10th Anniversary FAN SELECTION' CD with not a dark song, but a bright song. So, rank not-withstanding, isn't it perfect!? --Yoko Shimomura
Farewell Kabul: from Afghanistan to a More Dangerous World
Christina Lamb
William Collins, 640pp, £25
The Good War: Why We Couldn't Win the War or the Peace in Afghanistan
Jack Fairweather
Jonathan Cape, 512pp, £20
“We are with you for the long run . . . standing shoulder to shoulder.” Such was the resolute promise of world leaders after the 9/11 attacks that provoked an invasion of Afghanistan and the fall of a pariah Taliban regime. War-weary Afghans hailed what was widely welcomed as the best chance in a generation to bring peace and prosperity to their shattered land. I remember reflecting then that this would be a test case for our time: “What would be the result when men and women of goodwill, with great resources and troops, try to put a country back together again?” More than a decade on, we all have an answer. Many would say, simply and sadly, “We failed.” Fuller answers are to be found in two very good books by British newspaper journalists that sit with ­distinction in a growing library about where we – both Afghans and the international community – went wrong.
The Sunday Times correspondent Christina Lamb has spent many years living in a region where she built up personal contacts and a forensic understanding of how things work and why they don't. Farewell Kabul is an impassioned, at moments anguished, love letter to Afghanistan. She has drawn the best from her many notebooks – ­except the one lost in a Taliban ambush in Helmand – to tell us a tale of defining moments and leading characters.
The war reporter Jack Fairweather's The Good War, meanwhile, can feel one step away from the action but is no less compelling or valuable. His is a chronology of a war of our time; it holds one's attention and he has done his research. Both of these books can make for painful reading. Chapter after chapter, there are moments of missed opportunity and misunderstanding.
Lamb sets out her stall at the start:
Over those 13 years I watched with growing incredulity as we fought a war with our hands tied, committed too little too late, became distracted by a new war of our own making [Iraq] based on wrong information, and turned a blind eye as our enemy was being helped by our own ally [Pakistan].
And Fairweather highlights the consequence of a promise that was “pure fantasy”. The world broke its pledge to Afghanistan: “It is the story of how the promise of a new military doctrine was ended by the Good War in Afghanistan and what it means for the future of western military action in the developing world.” The people of Syria and Iraq pleading for help may already be paying the price.
Afghanistan is undeniably a better place in many ways than it was in late 2001. More children are at school; primary health care has improved; more roads have been built; there's an elected parliament, a constitution, and more. But the headlines are grim: horrific Taliban attacks, rising corruption, the protracted crisis over last year's disputed presidential elections, which aroused fears of civil war. Why didn't men and women of goodwill, with great resources and troops, achieve more and achieve what they said they could – and would – do?
Few, on any side, fully appreciated the enormity of the task. When the partnership between Afghanistan and the west began in 2002, during what became known as the “honeymoon years”, the country did not have a functioning telephone system, much fewer computers; a financial system, including a new currency, had to be built from scratch; warlords had more men under arms than the national army; and many in a generation born in war were impoverished and illiterate. The charismatic new leader, Hamid Karzai, had, as Lamb puts it, “no experience of running anything”.
What made it worse was that Nato powers and their allies weren't really sure what their promise meant. As the years went by, the goalposts kept moving. Was theirs a narrowly defined mission to track down al-Qaeda, as some in the US administration argued? Or was this a much more demanding and costly engagement of “nation-building”? When British troops finally went out to Helmand in 2006 they were told that it was a “peace support” mission. It turned into Britain's longest conflict since the Hundred Years War and the longest ever fought by the United States. And it's not over yet.
In his book, Fairweather reveals the pressures and shifting priorities for individual Nato armies. Hard decisions about battle plans and deployments were distorted by rivalries among senior Nato officers and a dysfunctional chain of command between national and international forces. Once politicians and diplomats joined the fray, an even bigger battle of wills complicated bloody battles on the ground. Even when realities should have dictated a change of course, “The plans were the plans and . . . there would not be any backtracking.”
This is a history seared on the broken hearts of all too many families in Britain, Afghanistan and beyond. A dusty town such as Sangin, with a population of 14,000, cost Britain a third of its casualties. Fairweather writes of one of them, the 20-year-old rifleman Allan Arnold, “found hanged in the woods near his barracks. A note on his body, addressed to his mother, explained that he couldn't cope any longer.”
In 2010, I attended one of the training sessions of the current army chief, General Nick Carter, for his troops before they went into Kandahar, the most crucial province in the fight against the Taliban. By then, “shoulder to shoulder” had been translated into Dari as “shohna ba shohna” and the mission was called “Moshtarak”, or “Together”. It was to be nothing less than a revolution in how British soldiers would live and work, side by side, with their Afghan ­counterparts. Yet, despite some successes, gaps in resources, training, culture and expectations often pulled them apart.
In October 2010, on the day that a long-planned military operation around Kandahar was being launched, I visited Karzai in his heavily fortified palace compound and asked him about it. “I'm against it,” he declared. “But you're the commander-in-chief,” I replied. “What can I do?” he shrugged. The president, who rarely numbered among the fighters when he was part of the Afghan mujahedin battling Soviet occupation, was a reluctant and at times downright hostile commander-in-chief. It didn't help that he wasn't treated like one, either. The US general Stanley McChrystal, who built one of the best working relationships with him, told me that on one occasion when he went to the palace to tell Karzai about an imminent major military operation, the president replied: “It's the first time someone has come to ask me about an operation.”
This is a critical point – perhaps the most critical point of all – and both Lamb and Fairweather keep coming back to it. All too often, Afghans aren't even consulted about plans for their own country.
It wasn't just the military that misspent millions. Lamb writes, “The US agricultural department spent $34.4m trying to create a market for soy beans, which Afghans had never eaten, and which, like mushrooms, they had no idea how to cook.” Even the British, who pride themselves on knowing the history, commit ­embarrassing mistakes. A David Attenborough film of oceans and dolphins jolts tribal elders who have never seen the sea. They can't understand why British soldiers and civilians are “projecting monsters on their wall”. By 2007 the new British ambassador, Sherard Cowper-Coles, assessed that building a “viable, truly national government” would take 30 years. But most countries were already starting to look towards the exit.
“There isn't a day when I don't think, ‘If only,'” the former CIA official Gary Bernt­sen tells Lamb about the botched mission in December 2001 to get Osama Bin Laden while he was still in the Tora Bora caves of eastern Afghanistan. There is a lot of “if only” in these books.
One of the many interesting threads in Fairweather's account starts from the Bonn conference of November 2001 to choose a new leadership as Taliban rule crumbled. No one from the Taliban was invited: it would have been unthinkable at the time. But the then UN envoy Lakhdar Brahimi now calls it, with palpable regret, the “original sin”. Fairweather finds that over the next decade, many possible openings to engage were not explored, or were quickly shut down. This is a very big “what if” to which there is no certain answer.
Meanwhile, the west's failure to confront Pakistan's double-dealing over the ­Taliban was one of many strains in an increasingly poisoned relationship with President ­Karzai. Lamb provides some jaw-dropping examples of “operational complicity” between Pakistani soldiers along the border and the Taliban, fighting on the other side.
The situation in Iraq casts an even longer shadow, from the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks, when the Bush administration started plotting an Iraqi war, to the years after the fall of the Taliban. Then, when General David Petraeus was sent from Iraq to Afghanistan to oversee a “surge” in troops and resources, he brought a team that often saw Afghanistan through an Iraqi prism.
This is not, however, a history without men and women who tried to do good. In Fairweather's book, we read about a 26-year-old Australian, Tom Gregg, a UN diplomat, who took great personal risks to make slow but steady progress in establishing trust in Paktia Province, where few foreigners dare to work. There are others like him, from many nations, who continue to work in or on Afghanistan. Afghans, though, will tell you that they – and only they – can put and keep their country on a more secure road to recovery. And Afghan women will tell you their problems did not begin or end with the Taliban. They still look for our support.
The mistakes and misunderstandings of the past 13 and a half years are often explained away by Afghanistan's forbidding landscape and its ferocious spirit that resists invaders and buries them in a “graveyard of empires”. But Mohammad Gul Barahawi, an old man with a grey turban and a beard, imparts some important wisdom to Lamb: “Let me say this. The one who comes as brother will be treated as such. Those who come to betray us will be sent away.”
In recent years, western officials have often invoked phrases such as “No one expected it to become Switzerland” – a wording that both amuses and insults Afghans, who point out that they never asked or wanted to be Swiss. Phrases such as “good enough” (for Afghans) became the new gold standard as western governments struggled to create a narrative of success. I joked with an Afghan friend that the country's Free and Fair Electoral Forum should be renamed the “Good Enough Electoral Forum”.
Afghans have to shoulder their share of the blame. A failure to tackle corruption, including the vast vote-rigging, as well as their personal and political vendettas, are also part of this chequered history.
General Carter shares this reflection with Lamb: “I think the most important lesson I learned from all of this is before you get involved in these problems it's very important you have an understanding what the nature of the problem is, and then set your level of ambition accordingly.”
One hopes that if men and women of goodwill, with great resources and troops, ever try to put a country together again, they will remember that, even then, it's still not good enough.

The question is pertinent in light of recent revelations that an Israeli official, working for the country's embassy in London, was plotting ways to "take down" various British politicians over their opposition to Israeli settlements and support for a Palestinian state.
It comes as only the latest in a series of such nefarious activities on the part of a state that has long operated with scant regard for international law at home and overseas.
Indeed, rather than a state operating in accordance with international law and diplomatic norms, Israel increasingly evinces the character of a rogue state making up its own rules and norms as it goes along. Whether the on-going illegal military occupation of the West Bank, the expansion of illegal Jewish-only settlements on Palestinian land, or the siege of Gaza, which comes under rubric of collective punishment and is therefore illegal, we are talking here about a country that believes it can act with impunity.
The Israeli official in question in this instance, Shai Masot, was secretly filmed during a meeting which he attended at a London restaurant with a British civil servant and former Conservative Party official, and a man he thought worked for the pro-Israel pressure group Labour Friends of Israel. This individual, known as Robin, was in truth an undercover reporter with Al Jazeera.
The most high profile object of Masot's ire within the British political establishment was Sir Alan Duncan MP, the country's Minister of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs.

In a 2014 speech, Duncan described Israel's on-going policy towards the Palestinians thus: "Settlements are illegal colonies built in someone else's country. They are an act of theft, and what is more something which is both initiated and supported by the state of Israel.
"Settlement activity is not carried out by some minority group outside the orbit of the Israeli state. Settlement activity is systematically initiated, implemented and supported by the Israeli Government, who authorize, implement and protect the relentless illegal expansion of the borders of Israel. This is reprehensible," Duncan added.
Duncan then made the key point that:
"It is no exaggeration to say that many settlers are state-supported militia, defying international law, driving out the rightful inhabitants from their land, and creating an illegal economy at the expense of those who have been cruelly displaced."
According to the Israeli embassy in London, Masot was a junior official. Yet his business card described him as a "senior political officer." He is also believed to hold a position within the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) as "deputy head of the international organizations sector."
The political backlash in response to the exposure of this shocking violation of diplomatic protocol has involved the leader of the Labour Party, Jeremy Corbyn, calling for a full investigation. In this, he is being supported by MPs from both sides of the political divide.
Corbyn has previously come under huge criticism in the mainstream media for his long record of support and campaigning for justice for the Palestinians.

At this state, however, it appears Prime Minister Theresa May is intent on kicking the issue into the long grass, more concerned with shielding the Israeli government from criticism than she is in taking a harsh view of the actions of one of its officials in plotting to "take down" ministers within Her Majesty's Government.
If this scandal involved Russian officials does anybody doubt for a second that mass expulsions of Russian embassy staff would follow?
Of course, the Israeli embassy in London has distanced itself from Masot's actions. Whether we actually believe their denial of any involvement in this affair is another matter. In this regard, we should never make the mistake of underestimating some people's capacity for naivety.
The fact that Israel is able to undertake such nefarious activities and go unpunished or without sanction is impossible to deny. And when it comes to its UK friend and ally, this is not the first time its officials and institutions have treated it with contempt.
Back in 2010, Mossad agents used the stolen identities of British citizens to forge UK passports, which they used to travel to Dubai to carry out the assassination of Hamas operative Mahmoud al-Mabhouh.
The British government's response was given by the country's then foreign secretary David Miliband in the UK parliament, who described the use of stolen British identities as an "outrage" while pledging to "get to the bottom" of the incident. What followed was… well nothing very much.
Israel apologized and that, as they say, was that.
This time around the response of the British government is even more tepid. In a statement issued by the UK foreign office, we learn that:
"The Israeli ambassador has apologized and is clear these comments do not reflect the views of the embassy or government of Israel. The UK has a strong relationship with Israel and we consider the matter closed."
One of the most highly regarded politicians to ever hold the position of British foreign secretary was Henry John Temple, more commonly known as Lord Palmerston. He held the post in the mid 19th century and is best known for an analysis of a state's foreign policy that has stood the test of time.
"We have no eternal allies," Palmerston said, "and we have no perpetual enemies. Our interests are eternal and perpetual, and those interests it is our duty to follow."
When it comes to the determination of the current British government to support Israel despite Tel Aviv repeatedly treating it with unalloyed contempt, who can doubt that Palmerston will be turning in his grave?

A comment submitted to the Federal Communications Commission says Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) is a staunch opponent of Obama-era net neutrality rules designed to protect the open internet. The only problem: Leahy is a longtime vocalof net neutrality, and he had no idea there was a comment filed in his name.“Oh, my God. I wasn't aware of that,” Leahy said when he was asked Sunday about the comment . “I have been a consistent and noisy proponent of net neutrality.”Vermont Attorney General T.J. Donovan raised the issue of apparently fake FCC comments purportedly filed by Vermont residents this month, following New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman's efforts to bring attention to the matter in his state.The FCC is collecting comments from the public as the five-member commission decides whether to proceed with a proposal from chair Ajit Pai to reverse regulations designed to protect net neutrality.Donovan's office created an online portal that allows Vermont residents to search for fake FCC comments filed in their names and then report them to the Vermont Attorney General. Donovan also advised people who find fake comments filed on their behalf to contact the FCC.“A free and open internet is the lifeblood of modern commerce, and consumers expect transparency and fairness when they go online,” Donovan said in a news release. “Vermont's small businesses and startups rely on it to be competitive in the global economy and our citizens rely on it for goods, services and information.”Chris Curtis, the assistant attorney general working on the issue, said net neutrality is vital for the state's economy. “We cannot have Vermonters and small businesses stuck in the breakdown lane for lack of affordability or lack of access,” Curtis said. The fake comments are problematic because of more than the point of view they advocate, he added. “What really lies underneath all of this is that a vibrant democratic process … really relies on the people being able to weigh in and make their views known so that policymakers and decision makers have an understanding of what the public wants and needs.”
Leahy held a hearing on net neutrality at the University of Vermont in 2014, and numerous Vermont business owners testified in favor of net neutrality rules that require internet service providers to treat all internet traffic equally.
Thousands of the apparently fake comments are voicing opposition to net neutrality. The comments take the position favored by large internet service providers and industry groups: They say net neutrality rules amount to government overreach that will stifle innovation.
When Seven Days told Leahy that a similar comment had been filed on behalf of the Northeast Kingdom ski resort Jay Peak, the senator laughed aloud. (A spokesman for Jay Peak confirmed that the comment is fake.)
“I wonder who's doing it,” Leahy said.

So much for George Osborne's claim that the UK is a "safe haven". Moody's decision to place Britain's AAA credit rating on "negative" watch explodes the Chancellor's delusions. There is now roughly a 30 per cent chance that the UK's credit rating will be downgraded in the next 18 months. Given that Osborne chose to make our credit rating the ultimate metric of economic stability, this is, to put it mildly, politically awkward for him.
Just ten weeks ago, in his autumn statement, while announcing that the UK would borrow £158bn more than forecast a year ago, Osborne boasted that "we are the only major western country which has had its credit rating improve" (i.e. come off negative outlook). He said:
Last April, the absence of a credible deficit plan meant our country's credit rating was on negative outlook and our market interest rates were higher than Italy's.
By his own logic, therefore, his deficit plan is no longer credible. When Britain was first put on negative outlook by Standard & Poor's (S&P) in May 2009, Osborne declared:
It's now clear that Britain's economic reputation is on the line at the next general election, another reason for bringing the date forward and having that election now ... For the first time since these ratings began in 1978, the outlook for British debt has been downgraded from stable to negative.
And when the UK was taken off negative watch by S&P in October 2010, he boasted of "a big vote of confidence in the UK, and a vote of confidence in the coalition government's economic policies".
The Chancellor has been hoisted with his own petard.
The economic consequences of a downgrade need not be disastrous. France and the US have seen little rise in their borrowing costs since losing their AAA ratings. Indeed, France has just held its most successful bond auction for some time. But politically speaking, this could not be more uncomfortable for Osborne.
Yet if Moody's decision is awkward for the coalition, it offers scant comfort for Labour. Although the agency echoes Ed Balls's concerns about the lack of growth in the UK economy (it refers to "the materially weaker growth prospects over the next few years"), it does not accuse Osborne of going "too far, too fast". Indeed, it praises the government's "commitment to restoring a sustainable debt position". If anything, its complaint is that the Chancellor has been too timid.
As for the fiscal stimulus demanded by Labour, Moody's is clear that, in its view, this is not an option. Under the sub-head "What could move the rating down?", it cites "reduced political commitment to fiscal consolidation, including discretionary fiscal loosening". In other words, were Labour in power, the UK would almost certainly have already lost its AAA rating.
But then why we should listen to Moody's, the agency that gave AIG an AAA rating just a month before it collapsed? The answer is simple: we shouldn't. But this doesn't alter the fact that Osborne did. For political purposes, he used Britain's credit rating as a stick to beat Labour with. He can hardly complain if others now use this move against him. The hunter has become the hunted.
The NFL announced its full draft order Tuesday morning, confirming what the Chicago Bears already knew: They own five of the first 127 selections.
The Bears have nine picks total. If they use each to select a player, that would be their most since 2009.
They have picks Nos. 11 overall (first round), 41 (second), 72 (third), 107 (fourth), 127 (fourth, from New England Patriots), 150 (fifth), 185 (sixth), 206 (sixth, from Carolina Panthers) and 230 (seventh.)
General manager Ryan Pace has touted this year's class as “strong” overall and has made a concerted effort to accumulate picks. Whether he continues to package picks and trade them to move up or down in certain rounds remains open-ended.
The fourth-rounder from the Patriots was part of the Martellus Bennett trade, and the sixth-round pick from the Panthers was acquired in exchange for defensive end Jared Allen.
The draft is April 28-30 in Chicago.
One year into the Ebola epidemic: a deadly, tenacious and unforgiving virus
One year after the first Ebola cases started to surface in Guinea, WHO is publishing this series of 14 papers that take an in-depth look at West Africa's first epidemic of Ebola virus disease.
UNMEER/Martine Perret
Introduction - This assessment looks at how West Africa's epidemic of Ebola virus disease has evolved over the past year, giving special attention to the situation in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone. The success stories in Senegal, Nigeria, and likely Mali are also described to show what has worked best to limit onward transmission of Ebola following an imported case and bring the outbreak to a rapid end. The fact that a densely populated city like Lagos was successful in containing Ebola offers encouragement that other developing countries can do the same.
An overview of how the Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo evolved and was brought under control underscores the many differences between the outbreaks in West Africa and in equatorial Africa, where all previous outbreaks since the first two in 1976 have occurred.
Key events in the WHO's Ebola response are outlined to show how initial control efforts were eventually overwhelmed by the wide geographical dispersion of transmission, the unprecedented operational complexity of the outbreaks, and the many factors that undermined the power of traditional containment measures to disrupt transmission chains. These factors are also described.
In efforts coordinated by WHO, scientists and the pharmaceutical industry have geared up to develop, test, license, and introduce the first Ebola vaccines, therapies, and point-of-care diagnostic tests. As a strong expression of solidarity with the people of West Africa, these groups are attempting to compress work that normally takes two to four years into a matter of months.
Finally, the assessment takes a look at the potential future evolution of the Ebola epidemic. Based on what has been learned during this first year, what critical strategies and interventions will give countries and their partners the best chance of bringing the outbreaks under control?
I cannot think of a better way to demonstrate the powerful benefits of Smart Commute, than to highlight its potential during the winter months as well as during fair weather. Most, if not all Smart Commute events seem to be scheduled during times of reasonably nice weather. The problem with an unfailing practice of scheduling of events only during fair weather is that it reinforces the idea that winter is a bad time to partake in active transportation, when in fact it is a great time to do so. Leave the slippery, icy, slushy, and snowy roads to the public transit driver while you sit back, be warm, and relax. Or better yet, stay home and telecommute.
Other options that may be realistic in the winter for those living within a couple of miles of their place of employment or education, include:
Fat tire bicycling commutes
X-country skiing commutes
Snowshoeing commutes
Skating commutes – very common along the Rideau Canal Skateway in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada (see photo below)
With less daylight and colder weather, the importance of being physically active greatly increases. Otherwise, our sedentary ways, holiday feasting, and cabin fever can quickly catch up with us. Granted, if its -20F outside, some modes of Smart Commuting should be postponed temporarily, but that doesn't mean you still can't ride the train or bus to and from work or school.
Let's think outside the box, folks, and look for ways to promote Smart Commute year round, and not have it just become a fair weather effort.

There's place in Las Vegas for Disney fans of all ages that's worth a trip to the Strip.
Step inside the Magical Memories Gallery inside The Forum Shops at Caesars Palace and enter a world of Disney magic. From traditional to modern, you'll find all of the world-famous characters from Disney films in paintings and collectibles from a variety of artists.
The gallery is celebrating its grand opening this weekend and we spoke with one of its featured artists, Las Vegas resident, and voice of Disney's Belle Paige O'Hara. Her collection of paintings featuring Beauty and the Beast is currently on display. That's right, you may be surprised to learn that the voice of Belle also paints her too.
Paige O'Hara began painting as a young child and later sold her paintings to help pay for her schooling in New York. She first started painting Belle as gifts for friends and her work caught the attention of other Disney artists. When asked how memories of the character influenced her work, O'Hara said, "She is me in so many ways. Belle comes really naturally for me.”
Watch the full interview with Paige O'Hara below and learn about her plans for a special new series of Disney princess paintings.
During the grand opening weekend, August 11-13, you can meet more stars of Disney's Beauty and the Beast including Robby Benson (voice of Beast), Richard White (voice of Gaston), director Gary Trousdale, background artists James Coleman and animator of Belle, Mark Henn.
The gallery also features work from artists: Dave Bossert, James Coleman, Tennessee Loveless, James C. Mulligan, Tim Rogerson, John Ramirez and Michelle St. Laurent.
Schedule of grand opening events:
Friday, August 11 - Fundraiser for Candlelighters begins at 6 p.m. with the cast and crew of Beauty and the Beast.
Saturday, August 12 - The ribbon cutting begins at 11 a.m. including cake and photo opportunities. A question and answer panel with the Beauty and the Beast cast and crew begins at noon. Meet and greet opportunities and artist book signings will be going on all day.
Sunday, August 13 - A question and answer panel with the Beauty and the Beast cast and crew begins at 1 p.m. Meet and greet opportunities and artist book signings will be going on all day.
For serious Disney fans who want to add to their collection, prices in the Treasures canvas collection start at $150. Best of all locals can still get free parking at Caesars Palace with a Nevada drivers license.
Crafting effective Microservices in Python
TL;DR: API First approach with Connexion are powerful tools to create effective Microservices. The use of API First brings the benefit of creating APIs that fulfil the expectations of your clients. Besides that, using Connexion will help you develop APIs in Python in a smooth manner.
Google's acquisition of Apigee emphasises how important API's are in today's architecture of applications. Using Microservices with well crafted API's is crucial for maintaining a successful business, as it simplifies the development of a complex software solutions. Growing companies experience a natural raise of businesses' complexity. This complexity comes from market changes and to cater to customers' demands. Companies like Zalando, which are faced with such challenges, have chosen to adopt Microservices. The adoption of Microservices aims to make it easier to build and maintain their applications.
Microservices are a style of breaking up and organizing a complex software solution into smaller composable services. Those smaller services can be independently maintained and deployed. Each service is developed around a business capability that usually provides a REST API. Clearly stating what capability each service provides can have a huge impact on productivity of the teams working together to build and maintain their Microservices. Microservices developers are expected to provide to client-side developers, who build and maintain the web, mobile or other services, a description of how to use their REST API's. A failure to describe an API in a clear manner and to maintain an up to date documentation leads to broken system designs and frustration of team members. The API First approach is being established as a solution for those problems.
API First approach
The API First approach has been recently added to the original 12 factors of app development methodology—a set of rules and guidelines for developing robust applications that a group of experienced developers came up with while building the Heroku platform. It is an approach that focuses on having API specifications as a first-class artifact of the development process and using them as a contract to be shared among software developers and teams. Building the specification of a service upfront facilitates discussions among possible consumers of the API, creation of mocks of the API, and generating documentation, even before you write the first line of code.
Google, IBM, Microsoft, and other companies have come together to create the Open API initiative (OAI), to support the definition and establishment of a vendor independent format for describing REST APIs known as Open API Specification, formerly named Swagger 2.0. There are other formats available for describing APIs that can be used with an API First approach, the most known being API Blueprint and RAML, yet the Open API format currently holds a larger community of users and supporters. From a specification written using Open API format the initial code for the implementation can be easily generated. There is support for many languages and frameworks: Ruby, Java, Node, C#, etc. For Python, Connexion is the best choice in API First development since it relies neither on code generation nor needs boilerplate code.
Connexion is an open source framework built on top of Flask that facilitates the development of Microservices in Python following the API First approach. It was created by Zalando to meet the in-house demand for such solution. Connexion is in active development, I am one of the primary maintainers of the project, along with Joao Santos and Henning Jacobs.
Building a simple service in Python
The first step to build an effective microservice in Python is to describe what are the resources that are going to be available in our API using the OpenAPI Specification. We will focus on describing what routes, parameters, payloads and which response codes our API produce. We are starting with a simple example of an endpoint that responds with the string “Hello API!”.
# `my_api.yaml` file contents swagger : ' 2.0' info : title : Hello API version : " 0.1" paths : /greeting : get : operationId : api.say_hello summary : Returns a greeting. responses : 200 : description : Successful response. schema : type : object properties : message : type : string description : Message greeting
In the code snippet above we specified that our API has an endpoint “/greeting” that accepts requests with method “GET” and returns a status code 200, which represents success. Notice that the business logic is not defined in our specification, this part is left to the implementation of our endpoint which will be done in Python. The “operationId” is what define which Python function should be executed when the API call is made to your endpoint.
# `api.py` file contents def say_hello (): return { "message" : "Hello API!" }
As you can see, Connexion API handlers are free of boilerplate code. Normal Python functions that return a simple data structure are used as handlers for the API calls. Data structures returned by the handlers may be validated against the API specification by Connexion (if specified so). This validation is disabled by default to grant flexibility during development. Now we can use Connexion to glue our code to the API specification and have a server running. The easiest way to run our API is using the Connexion CLI tool:
# run this command in the same directory where you saved the previous files. $ pip install connexion # installs connexion, run only once. $ connexion run my_api.yaml -v
Now we can go to the browser and access the address http://localhost:5000/greeting and we should be able to see the message:
{ "message" : "Hello API!" }
To make it more dynamic we can change our specification to add a HTTP parameter for the user's name. For that our specification should look like this:
# `my_api.yaml` file contents swagger : ' 2.0' info : title : Hello API version : " 0.1" paths : /greeting : get : operationId : api.say_hello summary : Returns a greeting. parameters : - name : name in : query type : string responses : 200 : description : Successful response. schema : type : object properties : message : type : string description : Message greeting
Now Connexion will pass an optional parameter to our function. To handle that we also have to change our Python function.
# `api.py` file contents def say_hello ( name = None ): return { "message" : "Hello {}, from API!" . format ( name or "" )}
Our Python code is now matching the API specification. Now we can re-start our server, press Ctrl+C and run again the following command to see those changes in play.
# run this command in the same directory where you saved the previous files. $ connexion run my_api.yaml -v
Once again our server will be listening on http://localhost:5000/greeting. Additionally, it is now possible to pass an optional parameter “name”. Connexion includes an API console interface which is available at http://localhost:5000/ui. This console UI is enabled by default make it easy to call endpoints of our API. It also serves as documentation of our microservice.
The API Console Interface that is bunddled in Connexion.
Now we know the basics of how to create a Connexion application. For a more detailed example please check the Connexion example project available on Github. The official Connexion documentation is a complete resource of information it's functionalities. This documentation should be used as reference while developing RESTful Microservices using Connexion.
Moving forward
Companies are starting to realise the benefits of the API First approach. Etsy has published a blog post describing how the API First approach is helping them tackle challenges with providing a consistent API. At Zalando, API First is at the core of their software development lifecycle with a process for peer review feedback and with guidelines for creating RESTful Microservices, which are available open source.
We can find many open source tools that support API First approach available for diverse languages. Connexion is the perfect framework for a clean implementation of API First approach in Python and is in active development. Connexion does not rely on code generation. This leaves you free to evolve your API specification without breaking the code you already have implemented.
If you have any issues with Connexion, please feel free to post your problem to our issue tracker. You are also very welcome to send a Pull Request. We already have many contributors and you can join by improving the documentation or the code. You can find me on Twitter at @rafaelcaricio.

Senate Republicans clearly knew what they were doing when they were extremely secretive about their health care bill, which was released Thursday.
My colleague Brian Resnick and I wrote that they leveraged several human biases to keep our attention off the hugely unpopular bill. And the New Republic's Brian Beutler wrote that their tactic took advantage of the media's tendency to cover only new things.
The trend of less coverage is certainly true. The media covered the health care bill less in the past few weeks than it did when the bill was in the House and generating tidbits of news throughout the process.
We can see this trend in TV coverage:
And in online coverage:
But there's some nuance to be had here: Not everyone took their eye off the ball.
On right-wing news sites, coverage of the health bill stayed steady — and their message was one that would give cover to Senate Republicans who need to find a way to pass this popular legislation without getting too much flack.
And they got their cover in the form of a simple, but powerful, message: This bill isn't about the poor and the rich, but rather about Obamacare failing, and needing to do something, anything, about that.
But let's be clear: Obamacare is not “failing” in the way Republicans are letting on. Rather, my colleague Sarah Kliff has written about how the instability is caused by the Trump administration and their lack of clarity about the future. And an analysis by the Congressional Budget Office showed that, if left alone, Obamacare would keep uninsured rates at about the same level as they are now. It is not in a spiral, and it is not collapsing.
Right-wing media kept their eye on the ball
The period in question is the seven weeks between the House passing their health bill and Thursday, when the Senate released their bill.
We used the service TrendKite to track how 100 right-wing media sites covered the Obamacare repeal bill, compared with all other sites, which serves as a proxy for “mainstream media.”
What we found was that, compared to previous low points in coverage in 2017, mainstream media covered Obamacare repeal even less. I drew a yellow bar to let you compare how the recent volume of coverage compares with other low points in the past year:
You can see a clear dip after the House passed the American Health Care Act, likely because the media was covering the Trump-Russia saga and Congressional hearings with former FBI Director James Comey.
But on right-wing sites, the coverage didn't dip nearly as much, and stayed within the lower bounds of previous coverage levels:
In short, right-wing media kept Obamacare repeal on the back burner — and their coverage tended obscure portions of the legislation that make it unpopular, and push the message that Obamacare is collapsing.
The right-wing message that gives cover to Senate Republicans includes obscuring the transfer of wealth from the poor to the rich
Senate Republicans tweaked the House bill, but the core structure stayed the same. Ultimately, it is still a transfer of wealth from the poor to the rich.
It phases out Medicaid expansion, which covers the poor, and it makes coverage more expensive for many poor people — and in addition gives them worse coverage for their money. Meanwhile, it uses that money to cut taxes for the rich.
This transfer of wealth is something mainstream media didn't do a great job talking about, but right-wing media did a far worse job. Instead, according to our analysis using TrendKite, they focused on Obamacare failing:
Now, here's the catch: Mainstream media also focused on storylines about Obamacare failing, likely because it was something Republican policymakers repeated time and again. In both mainstream and right-wing media, about one in five stories talked about Obamacare failing.
The difference is that in mainstream media, a third of the stories mentioned Medicaid. This is important because a big part of Obamacare was Medicaid expansion, which gave states the option to allow poor people to enroll in free coverage. The Republican bill, first in the House and now the Senate, is about repealing that expansion, and using the money saved to give tax cuts to the wealthy.
In the vacuum of coverage, the message that Obamacare is failing won out
Senate Republicans outsmarted the media, my colleague Jeff Guo writes.
But it wasn't just about keeping the attention off the bill and its ramifications. In the absence of those details, they were able to push the rhetoric that was so successful for them during Obama's presidency — and so successful during the 2016 campaign.
It's the idea that Obamacare is failing, and that it needs to be repealed, regardless of what's put in its place. It's a narrative that Senate Republicans might be able to repeat to themselves and their constituents, time and again, and obscure the actual contents of the bill, which snatches away coverage from people who are poor and gives it to people who are rich.

KABUL, Afghanistan — A U.S. Army two-star major general was killed Tuesday in an insider attack at an Afghan military training facility, U.S. Defense and military officials told NBC News. He was later identified as Maj. Gen. Harold Greene, a native of upstate New York.
More than a dozen Western soldiers in all — including several Americans — were shot as high-level officials visited the heavily guarded military complex.
The carnage started when a lone gunman dressed in an Afghan army uniform opened fire with an automatic weapon during a meeting at the Afghanistan National Military Academy, located at the Marshal Fahim National Defense University in Kabul. The officials said the death toll is expected to rise given the severity of troops' injuries.
Officials earlier told NBC News that three Western troops had died but later revised the figure. There was no immediate explanation for the discrepancy, however, death tolls often fluctuate in the confusing aftermath of such attacks.
The NATO-led International Security Assistance Force confirmed that one of its service members died in an "incident" which is under investigation. It also clarified where the incident took place, after previously describing the location as Camp Qargha, which houses the university — along with several other military institutions.
Gen. Mohammmad Zahir Azimi, a spokesman for Afghanistan's Defense Ministry, tweeted in Dari that the gunman was wearing an Afghan military uniform and was shot dead after opening fire on Afghan and international colleagues.
A senior security source told NBC News that the suspected gunman was a bodyguard of the Paktia provincial governor, and his fellow soldiers killed him during the ambush.
Germany's military said in a statement that 15 troops had been wounded in the attack, including a German brigadier general, according to The Associated Press. Those details could not immediately be independently confirmed by NBC News.
Afghan President Hamid Karzai described the incident as "cowardly" and offered his condolences to the victims' families.
Camp Qargha, which is overseen by the British military, is sometimes called "Sandhurst in the sand" — a reference to the U.K.'s own officers' training school.
Training Afghanistan's 350,000 strong security forces is a large part of the current NATO-led operation, especially as the U.S.-led coalition prepares to hand over combat operations by the end of 2014.
An Afghan intelligence source told NBC News that a high-level ISAF delegation was visiting and touring the academy when the shooter opened fire from a window. Two senior Afghan officers also were injured in the attack, the source added, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to the media.
The U.K. Ministry of Defense said Wednesday that it was aware of reports and that the incident is under investigation.
Retired U.S. Army Col. Jack Jacobs said these attacks usually stem from troops being disgruntled about assignments or their pay — and not because they were "planted" by the enemy.
"It's very disturbing in any case," Jacobs told NBC News, "and particularity so because we spend a great deal of time and money for Afghan troops to take over the defense of their country by themselves."
NBC News' Alexander Smith and The Associated Press contributed to this report.
Venezuela's President Nicolas Maduro has pressed ahead with a plan to create a popular assembly with the ability to rewrite the constitution, drawing instant criticism from the opposition.
Maduro says the grassroots body is needed to bring peace to Venezuela, where nearly two months of anti-government protests have left more than 50 people dead, but opponents view it as a cynical tactic to buy time and avoid a general election.
At an open air rally before thousands of red-shirted supporters, Maduro on Tuesday signed a document formally establishing the terms for electing members of a "constituent assembly" that will be tasked with drafting a new constitution.
"Votes or bullets, what do the people want?" Maduro asked the crowd, presenting the proposed 540-member body as a way to defuse increasingly violent protests, which he says are part of a US-backed conspiracy to overthrow "21st Century socialism".
"Let's go to elections now!" he said, before detailing how the new assembly will be partially elected by votes at a municipal level and partially by different groups, including workers, farmers, students, and indigenous people.

The head of the pro-government electoral council said on Tuesday voting for the "constituent assembly" would be held in late July.
Regional gubernatorial elections, meant to have been held last year, would take place on December 10, he added.
'Evil announcement'
The opposition-controlled National Assembly promptly rejected Maduro's plan.
"The Venezuelan people do not want a fraudulent Madurist constitution and we will not accept it," opposition leader Henrique Capriles tweeted.
Maduro's rivals fear that a new constituent assembly could rewrite rules or exclude opposition parties, making a sham of future elections that could vanquish the ruling socialists if the polls were free and fair.
"Today's decision is nothing more than an evil announcement meant to divide, distract, and confuse Venezuelans further," said Congress President Julio Borges, the opposition leader whose coalition is pushing for early elections, humanitarian aid to alleviate food and medicine shortages, and freedom for jailed activists.
"Today we've entered a new stage and that means more struggle and more street action," Borges added
A Supreme Court magistrate decried the planned assembly, saying it was "not the solution to the crisis" and called on Maduro to "think carefully" to avoid more bloodshed.
Venezuela's state prosecutor also warned that Maduro's plan also risked deepening the crisis.
WATCH: What can be done to rescue Venezuela?
The opposition is demanding elections to remove Maduro from power. They blame him for an economic crisis that has caused shortages of food, medicine and basic supplies.
Maduro accuses protesters of seeking a violent coup and says he is the victim of a US-backed capitalist conspiracy.
Hundreds of people have also been injured in the violence, around 2,700 arrested, with 1,000 still behind bars, and 335 tried in military tribunals, according to rights groups.
Superlatives Notwithstanding, Even 'The Force' Has Its Limits
Enlarge this image toggle caption David James/LucasFilm David James/LucasFilm
Biggest, fastest, highest, most — it's hard to talk about The Force Awakens without superlatives. No question the Force is strong with this one at the box office. But would it surprise you to learn that despite all the records it's been setting, The Force Awakens went into this holiday weekend as only the third biggest Star Wars movie in terms of attendance? Or as cute as that adorable soccer ball with personality BB-8 is, just as many millions of people have gone "awwwww" at the puppies in 101 Dalmatians?
The Force Awakens is big, make no mistake, but biggest? Well, certainly not yet. In attendance, according to boxofficemojo.com, it hasn't even cracked the top 10 yet if you include the re-releases of older films. And it's had nothing like the same social impact. Lots of people talk about "adjusting for inflation" when they compare box office figures, but forget about dollars. I'm talking butts in seats. Charlton Heston put roughly as many butts in seats racing chariots in Ben-Hur. And over time he put many, many more butts in seats parting the Red Sea in The Ten Commandments.
Those seats were filled mostly in the 1950s, when the population of the U.S. was about half what it is now. So it was much tougher to rack up attendance numbers over a hundred million. Not to mention that Heston's biblical epics played downtown for months in exclusive, reserved-seat engagements before they ventured out to the places people actually lived. It was considered downright modern in the 1960s when movies opened right off the bat in the suburbs. When I went to Clark University, there were two — count 'em, TWO — movie screens anywhere near our campus in Worcester, Mass., and for very nearly my entire freshman year — and believe me, I remember this — one of them was playing Doctor Zhivago. The other was playing Sound of Music.
YouTube
Different world, obviously. But note that even without the advantage of playing in thousands of multiplexes (which hadn't been invented yet), both of those films — and again, we are talking multiple releases — were seen by tens of millions more people than have seen The Force Awakens so far. So were two films that scared baby boomers silly a decade later — Jaws and The Exorcist.
Even after all that, when the original Star Wars came along, it opened on fewer than 50 screens nationwide. But it was such a huge hit that on its way to becoming the second-most-attended film in U.S. history, it really did change the film industry — the way movies were released, and merchandised. It rewrote the rules. That's not going to happen with The Force Awakens, which is just going to sell a lot of toys and make the Disney organization a pile of cash. It is going to do that reeeeeally fast. That's the big change this time. In 1977 the original Star Wars stayed in theaters all summer, churning out practically the same numbers every weekend. This one's dropping 30 to 40 percent each week. It's still huge — approaching 100 million admissions — but it's going to play itself out a lot faster. Which means, if I can do a little crystal-ball gazing, that it will not — not even with a couple of re-releases in a few years — match the granddaddy of all blockbusters.

Gone With the Wind has sold more than 200 million tickets in its many releases. And it sold most of them back when there were far fewer people on the planet. In 1939, the city fathers of Atlanta welcomed Clark Gable and Vivien Leigh to Gone with the Wind's world premiere with a parade that reportedly attracted 1.5 million spectators. For the record, the population of Atlanta back then was barely one-fifth of that. Disney, by comparison, threw a block party for a few thousand invited guests when it premiered The Force Awakens. Might want to keep that in mind as the media reports on the history-making return of the Star Wars franchise.
History, it seems, is also a Force to be reckoned with. May the hype be with you.
According to an article in the Daily Mail UK, the website FridayFriday.com, has conducted a survey, which revealed that the vast majority of men surveyed, around 51 percent, would ask for their lady partners to chip in on a first date. Even more surprising, a frugal five percent responded that it would be a great idea for their date to even pay for the entire evening.
Interesting enough, financial concerns were cited as the number one reason why men today preferred going Dutch, however, many of those polled stated that they felt it was unfair, considering that the gap between male and female pay is shrinking, which means that women should be expected to contribute to a first date.
However, in the immortal words of the fictional State Senator Clay Davis from “The Wire,” Sheeeeeeeeeeeeeeit….
Now there are some social cues, which I would be glad to relinquish; helping with my seat or closing the door on my own vehicle. However, going dutch, or heck, even paying for a first date, ain't one of them. In fact, I have never in my 35 years–15 plus years of those spent dating–ever, and I mean ever, had a man try to split a tab with me on the first date. And as long as I am on the market, I will never, ever pay for a first day–ever!
My feelings are that a woman has to have standards and boundaries. And as said woman with boundaries and standards, it is my belief that a well-armed gentleman knows that first impressions count. And any dude, who wants to go dutch on the first date, should probably sit at his own damn table and let me enjoy my meal that I'm paying for in peace.
It may seem passé, however, many men have a laundry list of assumptions and preconceived notions about the proper conduct of women that they date. If she puts out on the first date, she is not-relationship worthy. If she wears a wig or weave, than she is superficial and self-hating. And if she wears short tight dresses, well, she is asking for it. So it's only fair that I share my–and a few other women other there I suspect–assumptions on guys who ask for a chip-in on a first date.
They are bums.
Tonight it's a free meal, next week it's the keys to your car. They are used to being chased, therefore are incapable of excising any tenets of traditional manhood. Lastly, they have serious issues with women. I'm talking about full-card carrying members of the National Organization of Men Against Amazonian Masterhood, or NO MA'AM for short. These are the type of guys who will sue an establishment because they couldn't get free drinks during ladies night at the bar. And you can regularly find these dudes, sitting in their momma's basement, writing long blog posts and trolling women's site raving about why we are all b***hes. You can read all about these types in one of my previous columns about these bitter dudes.
And I'm not buying the whole, “women make their own money” argument either. While the income disparages between women and men are shrinking, that doesn't mean that it's equal. Not to mention that black women, as a whole, still tend to earn way less for the same work as their black male counterparts and white people in general. And secondly, do you know how much it costs for me to look good for a date? Let's see: bath shower gel, hair products, hair salon visit, new outfit, new shoes to go with that new outfit, new purse, make up, possible tampons, birth control and mace. When you do the actual math, it is clear to see that woman spend considerably more money just to get ready for a date than a man would on getting ready and paying for a date combined. So if he is willing to reimburse you for the time you spent, plucking eyebrows or getting your feet done by Korean nail techs than by all means, chip in. But if not, well, pony up, chump.
I kid about the chump part. I know that we are all modern now and some women probably would be down for the dutch lifestyle, mainly because splitting the check reduces any ulterior motives such as sex. However, a great way for a man to earn trust is by paying in the beginning, and not sniffing around for sex afterwards, as it establishes that his only motive is to get to know her and spend a fun evening in the company of his date. At least that is how I have always seen it.
And that is not to say that I have offered, or even paid for dates before: usually those occasions occur on birthdays, on Christmas and in long-term relationships. And sometimes I will pull out my wallet and offer to pay to test dudes. I'm happy to report that no one has failed the test. But if every one decided to take me up on the offer, I would casually excuse myself to the bathroom and leave the dirt bag right where he sits. Remember ladies, always carry cab/bus fare. Just in case.
Last week, I did an NPR affiliate interview about Bernie Sanders's claim that the vast majority of corporations in America pay no taxes. Since then, I have heard Sanders tout his talking point on the issue several times — so I thought I might as well comment.
In order to put some meat on his claim, the candidate had asked the Government Accountability Office to look at the question of how many companies didn't pay any taxes. GAO obliged and here are the findings in one easy chart put together by the Washington Post:
As you can see the results are more complicated than Mr. Sanders makes it to be: 70 percent of companies don't pay the corporate-income tax because either they don't have a positive net income or when they do, not all of it is subjected to the tax.
Only 20 percent of large, profitable firms do not pay the corporate-income tax. They do pay state and local taxes as well as the payroll tax, though.

But even that isn't as simple as it looks. First, the GAO number is problematic. For instance, it uses a company's entire worldwide income but it only accounts for the taxes paid in the U.S. — ignoring the taxes paid to foreign governments on the revenue earned abroad and for which companies are getting a tax credit. So it is not so much that companies are not paying any taxes, is that they are not paying taxes to the U.S. government because they get a tax credit for taxes already paid if they decide to bring their money back to the U.S.
These tax credits are the result of Congress's band-aid approach to solving the problem of our punishing worldwide tax system. If Mr. Sanders doesn't like it and wants to be able to put his hand on some corporate-income tax when he is president, he should think of engaging in fundamental tax reform by moving to a territorial tax system like may OECD countries' governments have done in the past and seriously lowering the corporate-tax rate.
Now, I suspect that his preferred plan will be to end the tax credit granted to companies for tax paid abroad. The result will be more inversions, fewer U.S. based companies, and even less corporate-tax revenue and economic growth.

There are other perfectly legitimate reasons for large and profitable companies to not have to pay any corporate-income tax in a given year (in this case 2012). One obvious issue is that under our system (and the systems in other countries) companies can carry losses forward and backward to offset their profits in positive years. Since we went through that big recession not so long ago, companies have a lot of losses to use currently, which pushes down their tax liabilities.
The Tax Foundation has an excellent report by Scott Greenberg on all the good reasons why a profitable company may not have to pay taxes nonetheless. There's, for example, the issue of depreciation:
[…] the U.S. tax code allows corporations to treat a much larger fraction of the investment as a current year expense. Meanwhile, when calculating a corporation's economic profit, it is appropriate to treat the entire cost of an investment as a current year expense. As a result of these different calculation rules, a corporation with significant book income could have a much lower taxable income and an even lower economic profit. For example, we can imagine a corporation with $1 million in operating profits and $2 million in investment costs. Depending on how much of the investment the corporation treats as a current-year expense, the corporation could be making a large profit, no profit, or negative profit

Finally, I would be remise if I didn't warn Mr. Sanders: Be careful what you wish for. In reality, corporations do not pay taxes; corporate workers do (especially in a global economy). According to various estimates, between 25 and 60 percent of the corporate-tax bill is shouldered by workers in the form of lower wages. Burdening workers further is probably not what he wants and yet that's what he will get. The rest is paid for in the form of lower dividends and higher prices.
Now, it is not to say that some companies do not evade their taxes and that many will do everything they can to reduce their tax burden. Many taxpayers do, too. That's made possible, however, because the tax code is a huge mess of deductions and credits (some legit and some less so) for individuals and corporations. What we need to do is have a simple and fair flat tax (read this excellent post by the Cato Institute's Dan Mitchell about how that would work for corporations). If companies and people fill out a postcard-sized return based on a cash-flow tax system, there's obviously less room for deceptions or avoidance. If we don't, let's stop being surprised that companies and individuals are constantly seeking to use existing deductions, credits, and exclusions while also trying to get lawmakers to carve the tax code further.
First of all, let me say that Leona is extremely fun to play. Her kit is very reminiscent of Amumu, but remixed in a way that feels more active and versatile. Great job on that; no complaints whatsoever. But a champion being fun doesn't make them competitively viable.
So, dear reader, if you play this game purely for the fun of it... well, more power to you. But then this thread isn't for you, and I suggest you move on to a different one.
For the rest of us, it's very important that a champion is a good pick from a competitive point of view. Sometimes more important than being fun, in and of itself. The fun is derived from making a difference and winning matches.
Here are the issues with her from that point of view, roughly sorted from least to most important.
Damage / AP Ratios
This is the most talked about issue. I find it to be the least important one.
Her AP ratios really don't matter much at all. Tanks don't generally build AP, anyway. But her AP ratios are extremely out of line with similar champions. And when other tanky/beefy champions have ratios in the 1.0 range, and hers are 0.3 and 0.4, that just doesn't make sense.
Her base damage is underwhelming too. I can see why she was designed this way though. Her full WEQR combo is very easy to pull off AND locks a target down. If she had significantly higher base damage AND ratios on all of her skills, she'd be an assassin. With a powerful defense steroid. Power level over 9000.
A small buff might make sense, but not necessary. If some of the other changes below are made, I'd actually argue against buffs on her base damage.
Movement Speed
Base of 310. On a melee champ. That needs to keep up with the fight. Has skill shot gap closer, but no escape. Should be raised.
Mana Management
Can be worked around. Kind of inconvenient, itemization-wise. Especially noticeable early game. She needs to use skills to do anything at all, and is completely useless without them.
Mana costs should be lowered, in my opinion. At least the early game ones. In particular, her W and maybe her Q. Q already has a fairly low cost, as far as stuns go. She does need it a lot to do her job though. Moderately high cost on her gap closer makes sense. Maybe add a "If it hits a champion, returns X mana" component. Probably excessive I'd say. More worried about W and Q.
Edit: Since this keeps coming up, I'll put it here. Yes, Philo Stone solves the mana issue. Yes, Reverie makes her skills more usable. No, I don't think it's OK for a tank to have to spend 2.2k gold on a support item just to make her kit marginally viable. That gold should be going towards, you know, tank items.
Cooldowns
This is one of the most important ones. The mana management one is kind of a prerequisite for this.
Again, she needs to use her skills frequently to be of any use whatsoever. More so than other tanks IMO.
And her base cooldowns are way too long, considering how hard it is to itemize for CDR on tanks. Can you reach 40% CDR on her? Sure. But you give up way too much, and it's too Armor heavy. Neglects MR. Neglects tenacity. Very expensive. Can't do it until well into late game. Ranked games tend to not last long enough for it, anyway.
If maxing CDR on tanks made sense, all tanks would do it. Do tanks focus on items to max CDR? No they don't. Why not? Because it makes no sense. They focus on defense appropriate for the situation. Why? Because it makes sense.
Some people are talking about adding items to fix this. Guess what? That doesn't make sense. You don't add a bunch of items just to make one new champion more viable. You fix the champion.
Lowering her base CDR would allow for more diverse builds on her. More situational, based on the enemy team. She could actually build like a tank, then. Instead of having an inventory that looks like she's a support. Or having to pretend she's Irelia with less damage output. As an added bonus, you'd have to be more active in team fights and pay more attention to what's going on around you; would raise her skill cap in my opinion.
Would love to see them lowered.
Her Passive
The one thing I think must be changed is her passive. She needs to be able to trigger it.
In team fights, that would make no difference anyway. Everyone's throwing around AoE and lighting people up anyway. But it would allow her to solo top. It would allow her to clear minion waves when needed, just like other tanks. She'd probably also be a viable jungler. It would make her more viable and more versatile, without making her more powerful. It would make her fit into the current meta, and into future ones as well.
Why isn't she able to trigger it in the first place? It makes no sense.
> But Boloney, the current meta sucks! She's supposed to change it!
Sounds like a personal problem. And releasing a single champion that doesn't fit in at all will not change the meta. Not when there's a plethora of similar champions that do fit in nicely. It will just make people not pick her.
Another change I'd like to see is making her passive scale with something other than level. It should not be an AP ratio. It should scale off of Health, Armor and/or MR. Preferably AR + MR, not counting her W steroid (or normalized around it being active).
Scaling with Health would synergize with W too much. Scaling with AP would make AP builds too attractive, especially if her ratios are raised. Scaling with AR + MR encourages tank builds and makes her fit squarely in the tank role she belongs in. It discourages pure Health stacking due to her W. And it would allow her team fight impact to scale into late game.
Conclusions
She's a very fun champion, with a few - mostly minor - shortcomings. Some of them do need attention though. Most importantly, her Passive and Cooldowns... which seem to be the least talked about issues. Everyone's going on about her damage (which actually would be more than decent if she could just trigger her passive).
But hey, maybe I'm just crazy. BANANA!
Have a nice day!
Russell Crowe Throws Azealia Banks Out His Hotel Room
What type of crazy is Azealia Banks?!
The ratchet rapper was thrown out of Russell Crowe‘s Beverly Hills hotel room after RZA invited her over as his plus one. The random azz incident occurred Saturday when the actor invited 10 guests over his to suite to enjoy dinner and listen to some sweet jams.
Wu Tang rapper RZA invited his friend Azealia Banks to the low-key party but eyewitnesses claim all hell broke loose the moment she entered the room. Friends of Crowe claim Azealia laughed out loud at Russell's music selection, and then called him and at least one other guest, “boring white men.” A female guest defended the actor and suggested Banks STFU.
According to TMZ this is what happened next:
Instead, we're told she made an insane speech/threat to Crowe and the woman …”You would love it if I broke my glass, stabbed you guys in the throat, and blood would squirt everywhere like some real Tarantino s***.” Then for good measure, witnesses say she dropped a few n-bombs … yet Crowe remained surprisingly calm. We're told Azealia reached for her glass, cocked it back … and that's when Russell had enough — he grabbed her in a bear hug and carried her out of the suite. He then called hotel security guards who removed Azealia from the grounds.
Banks took to her Facebook page and claimed Crowe attacked her:
Four of the guests/witnesses gave statements during the investigation, and all 4 used the word “erratic” to describe Azealia's behavior. Even RZA claims Banks used the “n-word” in the incident. Not Russell Crowe!
Who do you believe?? Sounds off in the comment section below.

"This is the last mark we get to make with Nathan Drake," said Naughty Dog's Neil Druckmann as he introduced gameplay for the latest and seemingly final Uncharted title, A Thief's End.
Gathered at a hip Los Angeles hotel to present the first look at single-player mode in Uncharted 4, the creative director was both giddy and somewhat defensive. After several delays, the new Nathan Drake adventure was finally finished. Press were sitting down to experience new elements of the gameplay hands-on. A Thief's End's May 10 release date is looming ever closer. It's a big finish for a franchise that first debuted almost nine years ago, and one that's become increasingly special to its developers.
"As a team, this game felt really personal and special to us because it's the last story we get to tell with Nathan Drake," Druckmann told me later. "We wanted to make sure we get it right. Everyone's trying to cram everything into this game. Before we knew it, it got so ambitious that we're like, 'We're not going to hit our 2015 date, clearly,' but we didn't want to cut anything because it all felt important for this story. It all felt important for Nathan Drake leaving his mark. It was 'go big or go home' kind of mentality."
Learning Terrain
When I picked up the controller and started my first playthrough of the new Uncharted 4 gameplay, I expected it to feel familiar to the three titles that came before it. Almost immediately, it was clear I was in for an experience new to the Uncharted world.
At this point Nathan, Sully and Nate's older brother Sam – a new character, thought dead, who draws the younger Drake back into the treasure-hunting business – are in Madagascar. They're on the road to a volcano on the hunt for real-life pirate Henry Avery's Ganj-i-sawai treasure and avoiding the South African mercenary group Shoreline along the way. Turns out cell service isn't too great in Madagascar, as we learn in the opening cut scene, and Nathan Drake decides to stick to a good ol' map for guidance instead. So we set off on our adventure – by hopping into a 4x4.
Driving from one point to another can be inherently boring if there aren't enemies to evade or fight along the way, so Naughty Dog decided to make the terrain you traverse part of the engagement. While there might be some situations where persistence and messing with video game physics allows you to cross seemingly insurmountable areas, the section of Uncharted 4 that I played in a vehicle felt as authentic to the experience of driving an actual 4x4 as one could imagine. The surfaces you drive overreact to your vehicle; mud, in this area, proved to be especially tricky.
When A Thief's End's developers first decided to add a vehicle, they initially only thought about how it could be incorporated into actions scenes, but then realized the value it could have to Uncharted games' exploration component.
"We don't want you to see a volcano and then drive in a straight line to it or even if you make the path winding, at some point it loses interest," said Druckmann, noting, "This was going back to the original vision of Uncharted. We wanted you to go back to these uncharted locations, be lost in them, and then have to make your way through. Obviously [for past games] we were limited by hardware, time and resources. This game, we felt like we could finally realize those ideas."
The level we were shown had several areas that were difficult to navigate, as you would slide backwards if you didn't have enough momentum to push through it, or the ground didn't have enough traction for your wheels. At one point, you're stuck at an impasse and need to use a winch Sam, Sully and Nate have been bantering about adding to the front of the 4x4 to get yourself to the next area. (Using the winch also makes use of Nate's new rope mechanics and physics.)
There were also surfaces you might not expect to be able to drive over, like visual cues such as tire tracks on sleep rock inclines that help direct you through the correct path. With the trailers promising a diverse array of environments, Druckmann played coy about what other surface reactions might be in store deeper into A Thief's End. "As far as stuff you haven't seen yet... I don't know. I'm not going to say anything else," Druckmann hedged with a smile. "There are more action sequences and more exploration sequences that build off the stuff you've seen."
Exploring Dead Ends
The level was ultimately about getting from point A to point B, but instead of a clear linear path, the open-world inspired journey offered – and encouraged – detours. Every time you followed a path that ultimately took you off course, there was something to be found that benefited the exploration.
At first, A Thief's End forces you to this realization. While driving down a dirt road, prompts appear urging you to stop and exit your vehicle in front of a small set of ruins. The exploration proves largely fruitless in terms of the general story – there's just a treasure to be picked up – but the lesson is clear: take the time to stop and look around.
Later, when the path you're supposed to follow leads you to a rickety bridge you're supposed to cross, the circuitous road also takes you to a river that leads to a waterfall. It's easy to drive right past, but getting out of the 4x4 and exploring benefits you with finding one of the pirates' hideouts – complete with a note that you can add to your collection and, yes, another treasure.
There are several of these hidden areas and treasures scattered throughout the level we played, all of which are easy to miss if your goal is rushing as quickly from start to finish as possible. "We have this really rich history with these pirates who we really want to build up as characters, so we could do a lot of the environmental storytelling we've done in past games, let you find letters. Nate's journal now takes a bigger role in this game, so there are a lot of opportunities to sketch and write notes in," Druckmann explained. "For players who care – and we find most players do care – you can go a layer deeper, and you can go explore."
But looking around for treasure isn't the only indulgence you'll find yourself making that distracts forward progress. Simply put, Uncharted 4's landscape is beautiful. Druckmann admitted he still finds himself in awe of it. There was a concern there were so many high-res textures that it wouldn't be able to fit on the disc and the developers would have to downgrade certain elements. (Fortunately, they figured it out so no corners needed to be cut.) When you look out towards the volcano that's your end goal, it looks like a picture-perfect backdrop, but the more you progress on your journey the more you realize you'll actually be able to explore a significant portion of the video game environment.
Even better, the longer you spend in the 4x4, the more time you have to listen. Uncharted games have always had sharp writing, but getting to eavesdrop on Sully and Sam bantering? Listening to them catch up on Nathan Drake's past three adventures in ways Druckmann promises will have a greater pay off? Having Sully heckle you for taking too long getting to the volcano because you're too busy doing both previous points? That's worth the extra time spent, and makes the journeying more enjoyable.
"If you blast through, you're going to miss out on some of these sometimes humorous, sometimes insightful directions that when you do get to a pinch point of a narrative beat that everybody experiences, you could have a deeper appreciation if you did experience those other things," Druckmann said, noting A Thief's End has more in-game dialogue than any other Naughty Dog title.
To Stealth or Not to Stealth
In Druckmann's opening presentation, he described two of players' most likely play styles: going in guns blazing, or trying to get through a level as stealth as possible. I probably fall more into the first category, but Druckmann's statement felt like a gauntlet being thrown, so when it came time to engage with the villainous Shoreline mercenary group, led by Nadine Ross, that tall grass became my best friend.
This section of A Thief's End definitely leaned into both play styles. Coming upon the mercenaries guarding an abandoned tower in the middle of a relatively open area, you can either try to shoot your way through each area of enemies, or use the cover – like the tall grass in the field, rocks around the area and various damaged buildings – to help you progress without being seen.
What would have helped in this situation but what I didn't use to its utmost advantage was A Thief's End's new marking system. By clicking L3 (part of Uncharted 4's redone move set) you can add a marker above the head of each of your enemies in order to keep track of them as you progress through the tower. My patience with subtlety proved to be shorter than I expected, and I found it far more effective to stealth kill one section of the guards, then make a rush for the sniper at the top of the tower once I was detected. At least the new stealth indicator let me know when the enemies realized I was just going to make a run for it.
Similarly, another new mechanic I didn't find myself using as much as I'd expected was Nathan Drake's new rope. This might end up being a trick – and way to kill enemies – that becomes more fun in multiplayer, but with the exception of using the rope to drag down a box that helped me find that pirate's letter, there was never a moment in this demo that I felt using the rope would have benefited me more than my familiar set of skills. Even the wooden frame begging me to swing from it to advance my progress up the tower felt like the least helpful way to progress through the level.
Maybe if the clock wasn't ticking during my time with Uncharted 4, I would have persisted to try to stealth my whole way through. If I had, the Shoreline agents at the tower wouldn't have called the reinforcements that show up from across the bridge that leads to the next area and might have saved me a few more bullets. The benefits to going full-stealth might have something to do with Druckmann himself; he told me that after spending years and years developing (and thus playing) the Uncharted games, that's the play style he prefers.
"There are a few set-ups in the game that you can stealth through without engaging with enemies at all – you don't have to kill anybody. It's really, really hard, and a few of them even have trophies for doing that. I put it on Crushing [difficulty] and I try to do that, and every once in a while I throw the controller because it gets really hard," he said with a laugh.
Uncharted 4 looks bigger, better and more beautiful than its predecessors, offers up more diverse gameplay and creates a unique, more detailed feel to the world, but any Uncharted fan knows these games are made by their story. Getting 30 minutes to explore A Thief's End convinced me that mechanically this game is worth the wait through development and delays, but will the story be similarly impressive? For now, we'll just have to take Druckmann's word that Uncharted 4 is going to be a satisfying – or at least emotional – end to Nathan Drake's story.
"Coming off of Uncharted 3, we came on this project as really studying the three games that came before. We felt like, if this is the last one, then these three are the set up, this is the payoff. Every loose end, everything that's been introduced and not quite paid off, we have to do it here. We have to do it justice," he said. Though Elena wasn't present during the section I played, it's key based on Druckmann's comments that she plays a key role in that.
Druckmann, who has been with the Uncharted franchise since the beginning, sees Nathan Drake's journey as paralleling Naughty Dog's. Both came into the industry as "kind of young, kind of dumb, trying to prove ourselves, not quite sure what we're doing," but have since matured, settled down and started families. For him, the return of Sam back into Nate's life and the draw back into the world he left behind parallels the struggle with work-life balance that game developers – stuck on deadlines like the one Uncharted 4 faced before its completion – battle with every game cycle. It's a bittersweet concept, and hints that Uncharted could be heading toward a bittersweet conclusion.
"He has to make these difficult choices, and I'll leave it at that. It has an interesting climax through how it all pays off," Druckmann said. "I think life is complex. Life has its happy moments and its bittersweet and sad moments. I think this game has to capture all of that."

Chapter Text
Scott sighed and closed his email. Jaal had invited him to meet his mother. “So is this a friendly meeting, or what?” he muttered to himself.
“What do you mean?” SAM asked from the corner of his desk.
He still wasn't used to the sensation of never actually being alone. Sure, he could tell SAM to ignore him, but more and more he was leaving SAM on so the AI could ‘experience' his life. He wanted him to know that there was more to being a person than dodging Kett bullets and planting colony flags.
“I like Jaal” he told the blue globe that represented his AI companion. “But I don't know if he likes me.”
“As a romantic partner?” SAM clarified.
“Yeah.”
“And?” SAM prodded him to go on. Sometimes Scott got the distinct impression that he lacked patience for human processing speeds. Or maybe SAM was still used to talking to his father, the genius.
Before he really thought about it, he asked “Do you miss my dad, SAM?”
“Yes and no” SAM said. “In the human context, your father is no more. But in my memory banks, he is as real and as constant as he ever was.”
“With the exception of the memories he blocked, I can still access every heartbeat, every instruction, everything we ever experienced together. But in another sense, he's a broken input. I relied on him for information, but now that comes to me through you. Nothing new will come from him. He is a closed loop.”
Scott let out a long breath and leaned his head on his hand. He stared blankly at the Nomad model he'd bought on their last trip to the Nexus and tried to imagine his dad being alive and dead at the same time. Wasn't that just like his own memory, but at quantum speed? As always, the enormity of SAM left him in awe.
He'd been absolutely lost in his own thoughts when SAM asked, almost quietly “Ryder, can I ask you a question?”
“Sure”
“Can you tell me about your romantic attachment?” SAM asked
A surprised laugh bubbled out of him. “Yeah, okay. But I hope you already know where babies come from”
SAM was clearly annoyed at his lame joke, but continued anyway. “My experience of such attachments was a long-established relationship. Cherished, familiar, but tragic. I've never known the beginning of an attachment. Perspective on your feelings would place it in context.”
His crush on Jaal certainly was on the other end of the spectrum from his parents lifetime of commitment. “I like him.” he said, stupidly. “I like the way he looks, of course, and the way he talks. I think I wouldn't like him if he wasn't also a genuinely nice guy. He seems reliable. When he says something, I'm pretty sure it's honest”
“Liam is also nice.” SAM said.
He had a point.
“Liam is nice.” Scott replied “And I can't really tell you what makes my feelings for Jaal different than my feelings for Liam. It's not just sexual desire. Liam's cute too, but Jaal fascinates me. I want to know everything about him. I think about him when he's not around. I try to get as much of his time as I can when he is.”
“So people have favorite people like they have favorite foods?”
Scott laughed again. “Yeah, I guess you could say that.” They'd been talking about favorite foods the day before. It had been an equally strange conversation.
Total War: Warhammer is a big game, and the recently released Total War: Warhammer II [official site] is even bigger. But in the eyes of the Creative Assembly, that still isn't big enough. To remedy this, they've come up with the Mortal Empires DLC, a free download that will essentially merge the two games' campaigns together in one huge map, letting players assume command of any of the eight races available in the series so far.
To find out why this is happening and how the Creative Assembly are going about it, we spoke to Game Director Ian Roxburgh and Lead Designer Jim Whitson.
RPS: My first question is: why do this? Why did you decide to take the two games you've made, smash them together as one huge game, and then release it for free?
Ian: Well, very very early on when we first decided to do the deal with Games Workshop, and you look at the massive, massive amount of content there is in the Warhammer Fantasy IP, we knew that we ultimately wanted to do all of it, and make a game with all of it in. But that's just far too vast a task to do in one game, there's just so much there, that we thought the only way we could ever achieve that ultimately is by breaking it down into a trilogy, make three full-sized games just ram-packed with content themselves, and then as a free offering for our fans, we can merge them all together and put them all together and create what we ultimately want and what we believe our fans would ultimately want, which is this massive, Warhammer universe, but with everything in it.
RPS: Is the idea to combine it all again after releasing a third game in the series?
Ian: Yeah. So what will happen is when we release Warhammer 3 eventually, we will actually combine all three games into a bigger map from all three games. So this is like a halfway stage if you like, where we are taking the first two and combining them into the biggest map we've ever done. Then by the time we've finished 3 we'll do the same after that as well so and again that will be free to our fans.
RPS: Why did you decide to release the Mortal Empires campaign now rather than when the third game came out?
Ian: In a nutshell, because we could.
RPS: Fair enough.
Ian: Because whatever way you look at it, this game, the Mortal Empires campaign now, is a magnificent, huge game in its own right, it's by far and away the biggest and most content-rich campaign map we've ever done, and so there's no reason to wait until the end of the third, because we've already got two games plus DLC's worth of content in a free campaign, and we wanted to be able to give that to our fans to play and enjoy sooner rather than later. There's no reason not to do that if you can and we have the desire to do it, because our fans get the benefit of playing the Mortal Empires campaign sooner than they otherwise would.
RPS: Were you ever concerned that releasing it in this manner would lead people to believe that these were two halves of a game that were originally intended to be one?
Ian: We've tried our best to make it clear, because I think people who have played Total War: Warhammer II will realise that's a massive game in its own right. It's huge, I mean it was a massive undertaking for us to do, and you know, and the Mortal Empires campaign is something on top of that as well. So I don't think anyone would feel like we've sold them short on what Warhammer II was.
The idea is that actually they're just getting even more really cool stuff, thousands of hours of gameplay in the Mortal Empires campaign for free, and that is really about the policy from the beginning with this trilogy, [which] was to be able to give loads of stuff free as we go along, as we refine and evolve the game through DLC. Yes there has to be some paid DLC obviously to generate the revenue to be able to make the future games.
But at the same time, we're giving away a load free, so everyone can get the benefit of it, and feel that we're giving something back. And like we said that's hugely gratifying for us as developers and hopefully it's really gratifying for our fans as well. Because they get the benefit of the game getting continually better and better and better for free, even once they've bought the first game. So that was the plan.
RPS: How exactly does the combined campaign work? I've played both games and they're quite different in terms of the victory conditions and how the different races function. So how are you merging those two campaigns together in terms of how they play?
Jim: In terms of the victory conditions we're not going with the Vortex narrative on this one. It's more focussing on the sandbox aspect of Total War, which was still there in Total War: Warhammer II, but obviously because of the huge breadth and depth of content we've got by mashing the two games together, that in itself provides a constantly changing gameplay experience.
So each of the races has got individual victory conditions that are tailored to the flavour of that race which again keys back into the lore, and amongst those victory conditions there are ones that will encourage the player not to turtle in their starting area but to go out and experience the world so they go out into contact with all those many many races there. I mean in turn one of the campaign there's something like 117 factions present on the map.
RPS: One of the things I recall from the first Total War: Warhammer is that the races were quite different in terms of who they could ally with and where they could place settlements. With this Mortal Empires campaign seems to be more focussed on conquest. How are you going to facilitate that through the game systems?
Jim: Well, we haven't got the mechanic we had in Warhammer 1 where, for instance, Dwarves could only capture territory off of Greenskins. We've included the mechanic we had in Total War: Warhammer II with climates and universal territory capture, so you can legitimately go over to Ulthwan as Karl Franz and actually capture territory over there. It's not necessarily always going to work out for you particularly well because there's a place that's got a climate that doesn't really suit your race then you're going to make slower progress there. But that's all part of the strategic thinking.
We've got much more sea hexes as well. That adds a whole new dynamic and the AI's been beefed up to handle intercontinental invasions across seas. So you can't just capture an entire continent and then sit there with it lightly defended. You're gonna get the AI turning up on your shore and attacking you. So all of those things are new, strategic things that players need to be thinking about, and that keeps it fresh. At the same time we've still got Diplomacy. That's all perfectly legitimate. It's a sandbox game, we don't lock of diplomatic options particualrly between factions. So if you want to as Karl Franz make an alliance with the Vampire Counts, if you work hard at that and make the right moves that's perfectly possible.
Ian: I've just been doing that in my campaign [laughs].
Jim: So it's all about providing players with that toolbox of toys and features to you know, go about things in the way that they want to.
RPS: How have you merged the two maps? What changes have you needed to make in order to make the setting as a whole functional?
Ian: Well first and foremost, the gameplay and the design is the priority in this. So we did look long and hard about how we'd go about doing it, and very early on came to the conclusion that just a simple adding of both maps together wasn't going to be the right gameplay choice. Because even in the Vortex campaign, if you've played that you'll realise there are four separate continents and you'll spend a lot of the game just building up on one of those continents in relative isolation. If you just bolt that onto another massive map on the other side of the world, again it would be so long before you broke out of that and actually engaged with others.
So largely from that point of view, and also the more technical restrictions or considerations, like for example, the end-turn times. There are so many new factions in this new game, and the end turn goes through all these factions. We don't want you to be waiting much longer than previously for each end turn.
So what we've done is we've reduced the actual scales and size of the map for the New World part of the map, but it's still as rich in content, it's still got loads and loads of regions to capture. But it's not as vast as the Vortex map was itself if you follow me. So it's designed to bring the Lizardmen and the High Elves into a bigger world more in terms of gameplay and to keep the whole thing under control. But the whole map is still way bigger than anything we've done and it's cram-packed full of everything. All the DLC we've done, for one. And there's 35 starting position, so you can play 35 different campaigns and when you consider how massive an investment a time each individual one of those is.
Jim: Yeah it's about bringing this scale, but without allowing the gameplay to become baggy in any way. It has to remain tight.
Ian: That was far more succinctly put than my waffle.
RPS: Alongside the map, you've got all the different races squaring off, and all playable. So when you were thinking ahead to the Mortal Empries campaign, did you need to make a plan so they would be balanced equally?
Ian: We knew full well from the beginning for each individual game and for the Mortal Empires campaign that balancing was going to be a big issue, because one of the fundamental design tenets of the whole trilogy is this asymmetry of races. And so balancing was always gonna be a tougher task than it was before, and let's face it balancing a game the size of Total War is always a tough task.
So very early on as part of this plan, because we knew what we were going to be doing, we built in new systems and put aside the time needed to be able to properly test the balancing. So we have put a lot more time than we would have in previous products into that whole balancing and new systems in order to do that, and of course we use a lot of internal feedback and feedback from our fans in pre- and post-release as well. We'll always keep refining and evolving and responding to feedback and tidying up the edges where fans report that something might be a bit OP here and there.
And again, the plan beyond the Mortal Empries release is, as we release DLC for Warhammer II and ‘free-LC' for Warhammer II, again we'll be patching in refinements to the balancing as well. So the whole trilogy is an ongoing refinement and balancing as well as having a lot more time put into the initial working game.
RPS: Thank you for your time.
Mortal Empires is due to launch on October 26th and is free to owners of Warhammer 1 and 2.
Donald Trump has called for changing laws that govern interrogation techniques to “bring back a hell of a lot worse than waterboarding.” | AP Trump calls Geneva Conventions 'the problem'
APPLETON, Wis. — Donald Trump believes American troops are afraid to fight for fear of violating the Geneva Conventions, he said Wednesday.
“The problem is we have the Geneva Conventions, all sorts of rules and regulations, so the soldiers are afraid to fight,” Trump said at an afternoon town hall during remarks on torture.
“We can't waterboard, but they can chop off heads,” Trump said, referring to the United States and the Islamic State, respectively. “I think we've got to make some changes, some adjustments.”
The Geneva Conventions, adopted broadly after World War II, govern the treatment of civilians and prisoners of war — including a ban on torture and summary executions. They mirror rules the U.S. adopted in 1882.
Trump has called for changing laws that govern interrogation techniques to “bring back a hell of a lot worse than waterboarding.”
Trump has also previously said that American troops would not disobey him if he gave them illegal orders, but he later walked that remark back.
A campaign spokeswoman did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Wednesday's remarks.
A bipartisan group of 108 retired high-level politicians called for fairly ambitious reforms of the U.S. campaign finance system at an event on Capitol Hill on Thursday. The ReFormers Caucus, a project of the advocacy organization Issue One, includes 23 former senators, 82 representatives, 16 governors, 8 cabinet secretaries, 10 ambassadors and one vice president, Walter Mondale. (The numbers add up to more than 108 because many of the caucus members have held more than one office.)
In its own words, the ReFormers Caucus endorses:
greater transparency measures, such as an executive order mandating federal contractors reveal their political contributions
stricter enforcement of laws, including reforming the broken Federal Election Commission
lobbying and ethics reform that ensures everyone plays by the same common-sense rules and
giving Congress and state legislatures broader abilities to oversee money flowing through politics
This covers much but not all of an extremely strong campaign finance reform agenda released this summer by 12 U.S. public interest groups. The biggest difference between the two frameworks is that the ReFormers Caucus does not call for a national public system of national matching funds, such as that advocated by current Rep. John Sarbanes, D.-Md, and endorsed by Hillary Clinton.
There are 79 Democrats in the caucus, most from the party's more liberal wing, including former House majority whip David Bonior, former Rep. Pat Schroeder and former Sen. Byron Dorgan. However, some are from the Democrats' corporate wing, like former Rep. Harold Ford, or are now corporate lobbyists, like former Senate majority leader Tom Daschle and Rep. Richard Gephardt.
The 29 Republicans are likewise largely from their party's once-thriving liberal wing, including former New Jersey Govs. Thomas Kean and Christine Todd Whitman and former Rep. Connie Morella. Some, though, are significantly more conservative, such as former Sen. Alan Simpson.
At the event, former Democratic congressman and Ambassador to India Tim Roemer was quoted as saying that “The influence of money is destroying us from the inside. … One of the greatest threats to us internally is the influence of money on our political system.”
According to Daschle, “We used to have to arrange schedules around senators' fundraisers and it was considered the exception, but now it's the rule. … If we want to continue to lead around the globe, we must fix this.”
Bill Brock, a Tennessee politician best known for defeating Al Gore's father, Albert Sr., in a 1970 Senate election, said, “Republicans have at least as much to say as any Democrat about reforms to a problem which calls into question the faith the people have in their government. We need groups like this.” Brock also served as chair of the Republican National Committee and secretary of labor during the Reagan administration.
The success of the ReFormers Caucus in signing up members suggests that many politicians do in fact recognize how big money thwarts democracy, as well as how the pursuit of it is personally degrading for them — but until they leave office they're naturally loath to change the system that put them in power in the first place.

When Runic President Travis Baldree nonchalantly mentioned that Torchlight 2 will have Steam Workshop support at launch, I thought I must've missed something, because this terrific news was new to me. But a quick Googling reveals that no other site has mentioned it in their previews, so I guess that makes this a GameSpy exclusive: Torchlight 2 is now confirmed to have Steam Workshop support when it comes out on September 20th!"There was no reason not to," said Baldree. Quite right -- after seeing Skyrim's already amazingly active modding community positively explode with new users after Workshop made installing mods a virtually idiot-proof, one-button process, I'm baffled whenever a developer tells me their gametake advantage of it.We already knew this, but it's relevant information: Baldree also confirmed that mod tools are coming, probably a few weeks after launch, and says that Runic plans to put some mod content of its own up there to get things started. (During our conversation he suggested he might put up a mod that adds cursed weapons back in, a feature that he loves but everyone else at Runic voted down.) He expects to see more fan-made armor sets and items in Torchlight 2 than in the first one because of changes Runic's made to the way they're sized to the different classes -- I'm very much looking forward to seeing what people come up with.When I asked if there would be DLC, he said that anything Runic puts out will likely be freebies which will automatically download via Steam and simply appear the next time you play. "We want to do about one a month to remind people we're still around," he said, adding that these might include new set items or events. The idea of finding random surprises even after I've played dozens of hours makes Torchlight 2 even more appealing than it already is. And all of that for 20 measly dollars -- if I got even half of the 64 hours Steam says I played Torchlight for that money I'd consider Torchlight 2 a steal, but all indications (such as co-op) point to potential getting far more than that.
There are literally thousands (estimated) of college football games every Saturday during the season. We know that, outside of the confines of the fans involved, many of them will never mean anything in the larger picture. But we cannot help ourselves in the early weeks from identifying certain results and saying "this game will mean something at the end of the year."
Sometimes we are right! Other times, we are very stupid and wrong. Keeping that in mind, these are the most meaningless games from the first ten weeks of the 2014 season.
Week 1 - #21 A&M 52, #9 South Carolina 28
What we thought it meant: Kevin Sumlin didn't need Johnny Manziel to put up gaudy numbers and challenge the best teams in the 2014 SEC.
What it actually meant: Preseason rankings are meaningless garbage but the offseason is a long and miserable time of famine so we eat what is available to us.
Week 2 - #14 USC 13, #13 Stanford 10
What we thought it meant: The Trojans were back in a big way and ready to reassert themselves in the Pac-12.
What it actually meant: Whoops, they lost the next week to Boston College. And it turns out the North division was pretty terrible outside of Oregon.
Week 3 - ECU 28, #17 Virginia Tech 21
What we thought it meant: Letdowns happen, and Virginia Tech experiencing one right after a big road win in Columbus wasn't that surprising. And ECU had just played #21 South Carolina to a narrow loss, so maybe this was a team to be reckoned with.
What it actually meant: One of these teams is playing a bowl game in Birmingham. The other gets to go to Maryland.
Week 4 - #5 Auburn 20, #20 Kansas State 14
What we thought it meant: On a night when Auburn's offense wasn't up for its usual pyrotechnics, the defense held firm and got the Tigers a big non-conference win.
What it actually meant: I bet Ellis Johnson only brought the tape from this game to the meeting where he got fired. "That's Jake Waters, man! THE Jake Waters!"
Week 5 - #11 UCLA 62, #15 Arizona State 27
What we thought it meant: After struggling to single score wins over middling non-conference competition, UCLA looked to have it all put together with this midweek demolishing of the Sun Devils on the road.
What it actually meant: The first in a series of circumstances in which UCLA tricked us into believing they were finally going to be good. Never again will I put my trust in you, Bruins. Never again.
Week 6 - Northwestern 20, #17 Wisconsin 14
What we thought it meant: Was Year 2 of the Gary Andersen experience about to collapse into total disaster? Was Northwestern, 2-0 in Big Ten play, a legitimate threat to win the West Division or, at the very least, make a nice bowl game?
What it actually meant: Yes, but not because of this game or for the reasons anyone thought. And no. God, no.
Week 7 - #13 Georgia 34, #23 Missouri 0
What we thought it meant: In their first game without the suspended Todd Gurley, Missouri's entire offense outgained Nick Chubb by four yards. Surely, Georgia had to be the easy favorite to win the SEC East in one of the division's worst years.
What it actually meant: ahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha they actually got crushed by will muschamp on his way out somehow
Week 8 - #3 Ole Miss 34, Tennessee 3
What we thought it meant: Coming off big wins over Alabama and Texas A&M, one might have been worried that the Rebels would have been a) exhausted emotionally or b) looking ahead to a night game in Baton Rouge or c) both. Not so; Bo Wallace was efficient and avoided mistakes, and the Ole Miss defense was as suffocating as ever.
What it actually meant: Then everybody got injured and Doctor Bo decided he wanted to use an old scalpel for this nephrectomy. We just keep throwing them out, and they're perfectly good!
Week 9 - #19 Utah 24, #20 USC 21
What we thought it meant: Though it wasn't pretty, Utah found enough field position, second-half defense, and last-minute offense to beat the Trojans and put themselves in contention for the Pac-12 South.
What it actually meant: The only other South team the Utes beat the rest of the season was Colorado. 8-4 is a lot less satisfying when you started out 6-1.
Week 10 - #10 Notre Dame 49, Navy 39
What we thought it meant: After a disappointing loss on the road against FSU, the Fighting Irish managed to overcome their own mistakes to beat Navy and stay in the hunt for a playoff spot with the "best loss" argument.
What it actually meant: Navy is apparently not as good as Arizona State. Or Louisville. Or USC. Or Northwestern.
But they're better than Michigan, probably.
The Syrian government has pardoned and released a group of more than 400 prisoners held on terror-linked charges and aiding foreign-backed militancy in the Arab country, Press TV reports.
The inmates were freed in the capital Damascus on Thursday under a presidential pardon decree issued by Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.
Speaking to Press TV, Syria's Minister of Justice Najm Hamad al-Ahmad promised amnesty to those who choose to lay down arms and turn themselves in.
“We have always said that the state of Syria is like a mother and while we crack down on terrorism with one hand we take care of our children with the other hand. We still release more people as we further study their cases not just in Damascus but all over Syria,” said al-Ahmad.
One of the prisoners (shown below) about to benefit from the pardon said, “I am from the city of Zabadani and I joined an armed group there. I wasn't arrested but I turned in myself when the army started an offensive in the city as I know the armed groups didn't have the best interest of Syria in mind."
“All the commanders are now foreigners from Chechnya, Saudi Arabia and other places,” he added.
The move to release prisoners seems to be an attempt not only to reach out to social segments that support militants in Syria but also to encourage more militants to lay down their arms.
The people of Syria have been witnessing a deadly crisis since March 2011. The violence fueled by Takfiri groups has so far claimed the lives of over 222,000 people, according to the UK-based observatory.
According to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), over 7.2 million people have been internally displaced, and more than three million others have been forced to flee the country.
According to reports, Western powers and their regional allies - especially Qatar, Saudi Arabia and Turkey - are supporting the militants operating inside Syria.

Two years ago I wrote about a nascent alliance between people who oppose teaching evolution in the schools and those who oppose teaching about the role of human activity in climate change.
National Center
for Science Education
The movement manifested itself most strikingly in bills introduced in state legislatures demanding that science educators in public schools give equal time to alternative theories on both or at least present dissenting theories. But because the science underlying alternative theories is deficient, many educators argued that such legislation was simply a back door to teaching religion in science classes.
The National Center for Science Education, a nonprofit group in Oakland, Calif., monitors legislation and local school board actions that are potentially threatening to the teaching of evolution. It also acts as a resource and adviser for science teachers who encounter problems with students, parents or supervisors on the issue. Climate change educators had no similarly devoted resource — until now.
On Monday, the center announced that it was putting climate change under its umbrella as well. Eugenie C. Scott, the group's executive director, cited a rise in “creationist-like tactics being used in the attack on climate education.”
Dr. Scott said national surveys of science teachers indicated that “one-third or more of their teachers have experienced some kind of push-back on the teaching of climate change” — everything from demands by education board members that climate change skeptics debate a climate scientist in class to objections by parents to the screening of “An Inconvenient Truth,” Al Gore's Oscar-winning documentary about global climate change.
She said she anticipated that more such incidents would become known now that teachers have a central place to report them.
Her group decided to take up the issue after concluding no one else was tackling the climate change piece, she added.
“Our ecological niche is that we help teachers deal with the political and social problem involved with the teaching of evolution,” Dr. Scott said. “What we are really good at are the local controversies and helping teachers resolve them. And now we will bring that expertise to climate change.”
Last of the city's streetlights were lit up Thursday evening after a three-year infrastructure overhaul.

Detroit — As the sun set over the Detroit River Thursday evening, representatives behind the charge to install 65,000 new streetlights gathered to flip the switch on the last dark strip of the city.
It was “probably one of the most momentous things to ever happen to the city,” according to Lorna Thomas, chairwoman of Detroit's Public Lighting Authority.
Thomas and Mayor Mike Duggan started the project in February 2014. With help from Gov. Rick Snyder's office and the Obama administration, the city now has public lighting that meets the national standard, Duggan said Thursday.
With the entire city lit by LED fixtures, Detroit is also the largest American city to have 100 percent LED public lighting, Duggan said.

The $185 million project finished ahead of schedule, and also a few million dollars under budget, spokesmen for the lighting authority said Thursday.
But some residents are not totally happy with some of the decisions made by the authority. They say where the lights are placed has left pockets of pitch darkness on some formerly well-lit residential streets. One light has been installed at every street corner and in the middle of each block longer than 300 feet.
Residents have also complained about dark alleyways, so the authority decided to also put up lights where alleys meet the street.
On Thursday, Thomas said the lighting authority added around 15,000 streetlights to the total number in place. The new lights also follow national standards for the distance between each light, she said.
Duggan said the streetlights are a huge stride for the city's infrastructure, but there is still a great deal of work to do.
“We've got to rebuild these water and sewer lines,” he said. “We've got a lot of work to do on the roads, and at some point I'd like to find a way to extend the light rail.”
Duggan said he hopes to continue to work with the White House during President-elect Donald Trump's tenure.
Shaun Donovan, President Barack Obama's budget director, said Detroit saw the “pinnacle” of a strategy the White House had for support of local governments. The city had the largest and most extensive team stationed in any city during the Obama administration, he said.
“When I walk the streets here, there's a sense of hope and a sense of progress that is tangible,” he said. “There are lots of measures you can look at, one of the most important would be to see that the city starts to grow, and I think we're very, very close to that.”
Donovan said he doesn't anticipate federal assistance in Detroit tapering off when the new administration takes office in January.
“This work isn't partisan,” he said. “It's not a vision that's Democratic or Republican.”
Speaking to a small crowd gathered in a tent on Atwater near the riverfront Thursday evening, Donovan said the world is watching Detroit.
“Detroit is the symbol of the rise and fall of cities,” he said. “Now it is the symbol of the rise again ... You are a beacon to the rest of this country and the world.”
Brian Ferguson, a resident who lives on the northwest side, said the streetlights are a visual example of change in the city. Ferguson's neighborhood was one of the earlier parts of the city to have its streetlights relit.
“I don't have to walk my streets in the dark no more,” he said. “This is a dream come true.”
Rufus Bartell, a business owner in the historic Avenue of Fashion on the northwest side, said officials “cannot overestimate the need for lighting” and its importance to businesses and retail corridors.
Before the lighting authority's work, 40 percent of the city's streetlights didn't work.
The city worked with DTE Energy to install the lights, which are twice as bright and more energy efficient than sodium lights. The LED lights also last longer. Also, to stymie copper theft, the lighting authority used aluminum wiring.
The lighting authority said it will repair any lights that stop working within three to five days of receiving a report of an outage.

The attack on Yugoslavia and aerial bombing of Belgrade was directly influenced by a military coup d'état that was carried out on March 27th by a group of Royal Yugoslav Air Force and Yugoslav Royal Guard officers led by Brigadier General Borivoje Mirkovic which was opposed to a Tripartite Pact signing which in turn was done by the Yugoslav government once all of it's neighbours had signed it.
The Coup d'état angered Hitler who took it as personal insult and and was so angered that he was determined, in his words, "to destroy Yugoslavia militarily and as a nation" (Jugoslawien militärisch und als Staatsgebilde zu zerschlagen), and to do so "without waiting for possible declarations of loyalty of the new government". On the same day he issued Führer Directive 25 which called Yugoslavia a hostile state. That day Hitler decided Belgrade would be bombed in retribution.
The Operation was carried out by the commander of Luftflotte IV, Generaloberst (General) Alexander Löhr who changed Hitler's orders of the general destruction of Belgrade into military objectives at the last minute. The Germans had 2236 aircraft (1570 German and 666 Italian) including, He-111P, Ju-88A, Do-17Z, Ju-87B, Bf-109E, Bf-110C, S.79, G.50, CR.42 while the Royal Yugoslav Air Force had 494 airplanes, only 269 of modern type including the Hawker Fury, IK-2, IK-3, Hurricane Mk.I, Bf-109E, Blenheim Mk.I, Do-17K, S.79.
On 6th April 1941 07:00, a massive attack on Belgrade started and lasted for two days. The first waves of Ju-87 dive bombers which were tasked with the destruction of anti air defences were followed by level bombers, mostly Ju-88 and Do-17 which in the course of two days dropped between 215–360 long tons on the Yugoslav capital. Although tasked with the destruction of military and government targets, the Belgrade bombing destroyed objects like the National Library of Serbia which was hit by bombs and set on fire, in the process hundreds of thousands of books, maps, rare documents and medieval manuscripts were destroyed.

Tasked with the defense of Belgrade was the elite 6th Fighter Wing armed with modern Bf-109E-3 and IK-3 fighters with the 2nd Fighter Wing armed with modern Bf-109E-3 and Hawker Hurricane fighters which joined the defense later in the day. Even with overwhelming odds against them, the Yugoslav pilots fought valiantly. They usually fought in small groups usually outnumbered 3 to 1 or more but still they kept coming until there were no more planes to fly and no more airfields to take off from.
This is a short extract told by kapetan I klase Milutin Grozdanovic. “At 06:30 a big formation of bombers flew over us, must be a hundred of them at least. As soon as we have seen them we jumped into our planes which were ready from 03:00 in the morning. We flew in pairs and after 2-3 minutes we managed to catch up with them. The Commander of the group Danilo Ðordevic as well as Božidar Ercigoj, Radoslav Stamenkovic and I attacked bombers, each of us attacked one. we had two cannons and two machine guns each.
After a short break at 10:00 we attacked German bombers again, there was so many of them, some were flying towards Belgrade, some were coming back, oh my god there is so many of them. On the return I've seen big group of 60-70 German Stuka dive-bombers. I attacked from distance of 20-30 meters not even using sights. We were so eager to fight that we didn't care if we shot down plane or not, we just kept attacking until we run out of ammo. Then and only then I flew low towards the airfield to replenish the ammo and fuel and give a chance to other pilots to take off.”
In enduring the battles, lieutenant Vasa Kolarov managed to shoot down two Stukas, but German fighters got him. Heavily wounded he still managed to jump out of his plane. To intercept the last Luftwaffe attack at 16:00, April 6th Lieutenant Colonel Božidar Kostic commander of 6th Fighter Wing took off in his Bf-109E-3. In enduring the battle he managed to shoot down two enemy planes.
Unfortunately traitors in midst of army were doing everything in their power to undermine efforts of the Royal Yugoslav Air Force by guiding Germans to attack reserve airfields, ammo / fuel dumps and any other target worth of attacking. One of these traitors was captain Valter Kren who escaped to Vienna with a Potez-25 where he gave the enemy stolen plans of places of gathering and auxiliary airfields used by the Yugoslav Army.

In the short April war, the Royal Yugoslav Air Force managed to shoot down around 95 enemy planes for loss of around 80 planes. Many bomber squadrons executed multiple attacks against targets in Hungary, Austria, Bulgaria etc. Most of the the Royal Yugoslav Air Force planes were destroyed either in combat, bombing or by its crews on the ground.
In the midst of the Belgrade bombing No. 37 Squadron of the Royal Air Force conducted two bombing raids on Sofia, the capital of Bulgaria. This was done as retaliation for the bombing of Belgrade. No. 37 Squadron, operating Vickers Wellington bombers flying from the Greece, conducted raids on 6–7 April and 12–13 April, dropping 30 long tons of high-explosive bombs on targets. These raids were carried out despite the fact that Britain was not at war with Bulgaria until 12th December 1941.
As a special treat to all our players we are introducing the roundel of the Royal Yugoslav Air Force which will come in patch 1.39. Enjoy.

October 19 was the anniversary of the release of The Who's rock opera Quadrophenia, a movie I loved in high school. This would have been normal, I guess, for a teenager in the mid-1970s, but I was in high school around 1990, when Vanilla Ice and the New Kids on the Block were riding high on the charts. Even among Who fans of the time, Tommy was getting all of the attention because the album had recently turned 20 and would go to Broadway in a few years. Once grunge emerged from Seattle, The Who's harder edged stuff (including Who's Next, one of my desert island discs) got the spotlight again.
I didn't understand the conflict between the mods and rockers that was the background for Quadrophenia. But I knew it was about a young man who felt angry and let down by the people around him and found redemption alone on a rock by the sea. And I loved it.
With The Who, you could be tough and sensitive, which is always a trick for a teenage male. That blend underlies one of the musical paradoxes of the band. Consider a scale where on one side is The Ramones, the toughest, most stripped-down punk band. Three chords, two minutes, no solos. On the other side is Emerson, Lake and Palmer, who covered Aaron Copeland and Mussorgsky.
The Who recorded a long story song, two rock operas, and the fragments of an incomplete third. Their first rock opera opens with “Overture.” And yet, for all of the potential fanciness, they sound throughout like they could jump off stage and throw you in a dumpster if you looked at them funny. They were progressive rock in ambition and punk rock in attitude.
One of the things I respect most about The Who is the encounter by the Quadrophenia character Jimmy with the band. When The Who wrote themselves into their own rock opera, they didn't appear as messiahs, like pop cultural stars tend to think of themselves. The point of the encounter is that rock stars are just people that the audience elevates and the idea that they are saviors is a sham. I can't imagine Bono presenting U2 in the same light. (It may also explain why The Who never had a number 1 record in America. Milli Vanilli did, but who would you rather be?)
There is a lot more I could say about The Who. The influence of James Brown and “Maximum R&B.” The fact that “The Who” is the correct answer to the question “Do you prefer the Beatles or the Stones?” The fact that “Won't Get Fooled Again” was named as the best conservative rock song back in 2006. But I turn the floor over to you…
Gardening guru and writer, Lynda Hallinan talks about growing your own garlic.
Garlic is a staple ingredient in a lot of cooking - but at certain times of the year New Zealand grown garlic can get pretty pricey. Lynda says growing garlic is something everyone should try at least once because it is "one of those that does actually taste better homegrown."
Lynda's best tips for growing garlic at home:
You're only as good as the seed that you started with.
If you don't start with really good quality New Zealand garlic, you are going to have problems. And how you know if it is New Zealand garlic is that it will still have some roots at the base. So if you're buying a whole bulb, that means I was grown here, because if it was imported, they have to trim all of those roots off at the border.
Growing garlic is not a skill, sometimes even the experienced gardeners have a bad crop.
It's really important that you put some effort into planting your garlic properly because I can tell you, as someone who has done it for 20-odd years, garlic is one of those things that's not a skill. You don't get better at it every year. Some years you have a fantastic crop, and for example last year was a really bad year for growing garlic. Mine was a disaster, other organic growers that I know had a disaster… there was a lot of rust last year, which ruins the quality of it. Unfortunately garlic is not one of those things that you can't say, ‘I had a good crop last year, so this year is going to be the same'. You have to put the same amount of effort in every year.
Winter is the best time of the year to plant garlic.
Garlic planting is a real ritual because you traditionally do it on the shortest day of the year, so it's kind of a pagan thing to do.
It doesn't matter if it's not the shortest day, as long as it is before the end of August. After August there is not enough day-time for the bulbs to fatten up before they stop growing about October and harden up.
Planting the garlic seeds:
Break up the bulb. The reason why you break it into individual bulbs is because you only plant the fattest cloves from each bulb. Set that aside for a couple of weeks. What that does be it breaks the dormancy. While you're waiting for the dormancy to break, you get on with preparing your soil.
Plant the little cloves a good hand span apart. The reason is because if you grow garlic really well, like if you've got lots of fertiliser and lots of water, it will actually grow to the size of a leek. A really good garlic plant should be about the same size.
Garlic loves ‘muck'.
The key things are to put in heaps and heaps of muck. ‘Garlic loves muck' is the best advice I have ever been given about growing garlic. When I say ‘muck', I mean anything kind of organic. So, well-rotted horse manure, fish fertiliser, seaweed, sheep pallets… anything like that, get it into the soil. Chuck in a little bit of general garden fertiliser as well because it really does take all of that and grow well with it. So get that in and let it settle for a little bit and then on the shortest day you can get it in the ground.
Garlic is an anti-social vegetable.
Garlic likes full sun. You can't really put it in a shady corner, it doesn't really like being put in pots. It's quite an anti-social crop as well. We think about when you eat lots of garlic, no one wants to be around you, and it's kind of the same in the garden. It doesn't like weeds, it doesn't like growing near anything else, it likes having a bed all to itself and if you grow it like that, it will be bigger. Every time.
Harvesting begins at the end of the year.
It's traditional that you harvest it on the longest day of the year. But the real key things with garlic if you've never grown it before is you should only really feed it at the beginning of the season. When it's only a small plant poking out of the ground, September and October are the big months to grow underneath the ground. That is when it is bulb-ing up. That is when it is fattening up under the soil. That is when you want to feed it. By the end of October it has done all of the growing it is going to do and then after that it is just hardening up and maturing off and the skin underneath the ground is firming up so that when you do dig it up, it's not just a bunch of naked cloves.
