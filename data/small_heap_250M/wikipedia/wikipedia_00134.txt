Venom or zootoxin is a type of toxin produced by an animal that is actively delivered through a wound by means of a bite, sting, or similar action. The toxin is delivered through a specially evolved venom apparatus, such as fangs or a stinger, in a process called envenomation. Venom is often distinguished from poison, which is a toxin that is passively delivered by being ingested, inhaled, or absorbed through the skin, and toxungen, which is actively transferred to the external surface of another animal via a physical delivery mechanism.
Venom has evolved in terrestrial and marine environments and in a wide variety of animals: both predators and prey, and both vertebrates and invertebrates. Venoms kill through the action of at least four major classes of toxin, namely necrotoxins and cytotoxins, which kill cells; neurotoxins, which affect nervous systems; myotoxins, which damage muscles; and haemotoxins, which disrupt blood clotting. Venomous animals cause tens of thousands of human deaths per year.
Venoms are often complex mixtures of toxins of differing types. Toxins from venom are used to treat a wide range of medical conditions including thrombosis, arthritis, and some cancers. Studies in venomics are investigating the potential use of venom toxins for many other conditions.
Evolution
The use of venom across a wide variety of taxa is an example of convergent evolution. It is difficult to conclude exactly how this trait came to be so intensely widespread and diversified. The multigene families that encode the toxins of venomous animals are actively selected, creating more diverse toxins with specific functions. Venoms adapt to their environment and victims and accordingly evolve to become maximally efficient on a predator's particular prey (particularly the precise ion channels within the prey). Consequently, venoms become specialized to an animal's standard diet.
Mechanisms
Venoms cause their biological effects via the many toxins that they contain; some venoms are complex mixtures of toxins of differing types. Major classes of toxin in venoms include:
Necrotoxins, which cause necrosis (i.e., death) in the cells they encounter. The venoms of vipers and bees contain phospholipases; viper venoms often also contain trypsin-like serine proteases.
Neurotoxins, which primarily affect the nervous systems of animals, such as ion channel toxins. These are found in many venomous taxa, including black widow spiders, scorpions, box jellyfish, cone snails, centipedes and blue-ringed octopuses.
Myotoxins, which damage muscles by binding to a receptor. These small, basic peptides are found in snake (such as rattlesnake) and lizard venoms.
Cytotoxins, which kill individual cells and are found in the apitoxin of honey bees and the venom of black widow spiders.
Taxonomic range
Venom is widely distributed taxonomically, being found in both invertebrates and vertebrates, in aquatic and terrestrial animals, and among both predators and prey. The major groups of venomous animals are described below.
Arthropods
Venomous arthropods include spiders, which use fangs on their chelicerae to inject venom; and centipedes, which use forcipules, modified legs, to deliver venom; while scorpions and stinging insects inject venom with a sting. In bees and wasps, the sting is a modified egg-laying device – the ovipositor. In Polistes fuscatus, the female continuously releases a venom that contains a sex pheromone that induces copulatory behavior in males. In wasps such as Polistes exclamans, venom is used as an alarm pheromone, coordinating a response with from the nest and attracting nearby wasps to attack the predator. In some species, such as Parischnogaster striatula, venom is applied all over the body as an antimicrobial protection.
Many caterpillars have defensive venom glands associated with specialized bristles on the body called urticating hairs. These are usually merely irritating, but those of the Lonomia moth can be fatal to humans.
Bees synthesize and employ an acidic venom (apitoxin) to defend their hives and food stores, whereas wasps use a chemically different venom to paralyse prey, so their prey remains alive to provision the food chambers of their young. The use of venom is much more widespread than just these examples; many other insects, such as true bugs and many ants, also produce venom. The ant species Polyrhachis dives uses venom topically for the sterilisation of pathogens.
Other invertebrates
There are venomous invertebrates in several phyla, including jellyfish such as the dangerous box jellyfish and sea anemones among the Cnidaria, sea urchins among the Echinodermata,and cone snails and cephalopods, including octopuses, among the Molluscs.
Vertebrates
Fish
Venom is found in some 200 cartilaginous fishes, including stingrays, sharks, and chimaeras; the catfishes (about 1000 venomous species); and 11 clades of spiny-rayed fishes (Acanthomorpha), containing the scorpionfishes (over 300 species), stonefishes (over 80 species), gurnard perches, blennies, rabbitfishes, surgeonfishes, some velvetfishes, some toadfishes, coral crouchers, red velvetfishes, scats, rockfishes, deepwater scorpionfishes, waspfishes, weevers, and stargazers.
Amphibians
Some salamanders can extrude sharp venom-tipped ribs. Two frog species in Brazil have tiny spines around the crown of their skulls which, on impact, deliver venom into their targets.
Reptiles
Some 450 species of snake are venomous. Snake venom is produced by glands below the eye (the mandibular glands) and delivered to the target through tubular or channeled fangs. Snake venoms contain a variety of peptide toxins, including proteases, which hydrolyze protein peptide bonds; nucleases, which hydrolyze the phosphodiester bonds of DNA; and neurotoxins, which disrupt signalling in the nervous system. Snake venom causes symptoms including pain, swelling, tissue necrosis, low blood pressure, convulsions, haemorrhage (varying by species of snake), respiratory paralysis, kidney failure, coma, and death. Snake venom may have originated with duplication of genes that had been expressed in the salivary glands of ancestors.
Venom is found in a few other reptiles such as the Mexican beaded lizard, the gila monster, and some monitor lizards, including the Komodo dragon. Mass spectrometry showed that the mixture of proteins present in their venom is as complex as the mixture of proteins found in snake venom.
Some lizards possess a venom gland; they form a hypothetical clade, Toxicofera, containing the suborders Serpentes and Iguania and the families Varanidae, Anguidae, and Helodermatidae.
Mammals
Euchambersia, an extinct genus of therocephalians, is hypothesized to have had venom glands attached to its canine teeth.
A few species of living mammals are venomous, including solenodons, shrews, vampire bats, male platypuses, and slow lorises. Shrews have venomous saliva and most likely evolved their trait similarly to snakes. The presence of tarsal spurs akin to those of the platypus in many non-therian Mammaliaformes groups suggests that venom was an ancestral characteristic among mammals.
Extensive research on platypuses shows that their toxin was initially formed from gene duplication, but data provides evidence that the further evolution of platypus venom does not rely as much on gene duplication as was once thought. Modified sweat glands are what evolved into platypus venom glands. Although it is proven that reptile and platypus venom have independently evolved, it is thought that there are certain protein structures that are favored to evolve into toxic molecules. This provides more evidence of why venom has become a homoplastic trait and why very different animals have convergently evolved.
Venom and humans
Envenomation resulted in 57,000 human deaths in 2013, down from 76,000 deaths in 1990. Venoms, found in over 173,000 species, have potential to treat a wide range of diseases, explored in over 5,000 scientific papers.
In medicine, snake venom proteins are used to treat conditions including thrombosis, arthritis, and some cancers. Gila monster venom contains exenatide, used to treat type 2 diabetes. Solenopsins extracted from fire ant venom has demonstrated biomedical applications, ranging from cancer treatment to psoriasis. A branch of science, venomics, has been established to study the proteins associated with venom and how individual components of venom can be used for pharmaceutical means.
Resistance
Venom is used as a trophic weapon by many predator species. The coevolution between predators and prey is the driving force of venom resistance, which has evolved multiple times throughout the animal kingdom. The coevolution between venomous predators and venom-resistant prey has been described as a chemical arms race. Predator and prey pairs are expected to coevolve over long periods of time. As the predator capitalizes on susceptible individuals, the surviving individuals are limited to those able to evade predation. Resistance typically increases over time as the predator becomes increasingly unable to subdue resistant prey. The cost of developing venom resistance is high for both predator and prey. The payoff for the cost of physiological resistance is an increased chance of survival for prey, but it allows predators to expand into underutilised trophic niches.
The California ground squirrel has varying degrees of resistance to the venom of the Northern Pacific rattlesnake. The resistance involves toxin scavenging and depends on the population. Where rattlesnake populations are denser, squirrel resistance is higher. Rattlesnakes have responded locally by increasing the effectiveness of their venom.
The kingsnakes of the Americas are constrictors that prey on many venomous snakes. They have evolved resistance which does not vary with age or exposure. They are immune to the venom of snakes in their immediate environment, like copperheads, cottonmouths, and North American rattlesnakes, but not to the venom of, for example, king cobras or black mambas.
Among marine animals, eels are resistant to sea snake venoms, which contain complex mixtures of neurotoxins, myotoxins, and nephrotoxins, varying according to species. Eels are especially resistant to the venom of sea snakes that specialise in feeding on them, implying coevolution; non-prey fishes have little resistance to sea snake venom.
Clownfish always live among the tentacles of venomous sea anemones (an obligatory symbiosis for the fish), and are resistant to their venom. Only 10 known species of anemones are hosts to clownfish and only certain pairs of anemones and clownfish are compatible. All sea anemones produce venoms delivered through discharging nematocysts and mucous secretions. The toxins are composed of peptides and proteins. They are used to acquiring prey and to deter predators by causing pain, loss of muscular coordination, and tissue damage. Clownfish have a protective mucus that acts as a chemical camouflage or macromolecular mimicry preventing "not self" recognition by the sea anemone and nematocyst discharge. Clownfish may acclimate their mucus to resemble that of a specific species of sea anemone.

In mathematics, the Hodge bundle, named after W. V. D. Hodge, appears in the study of families of curves, where it provides an invariant in the moduli theory of algebraic curves. Furthermore, it has applications to the theory of modular forms on reductive algebraic groups and string theory.
Definition
Let be the moduli space of algebraic curves of genus g curves over some scheme. The Hodge bundle is a vector bundle on whose fiber at a point C in is the space of holomorphic differentials on the curve C. To define the Hodge bundle, let be the universal algebraic curve of genus g and let be its relative dualizing sheaf. The Hodge bundle is the pushforward of this sheaf, i.e.,

Riza Sapunxhiu (15 March 1925 – 6 September 2008) was a Kosovar communist politician and economist. He served as deputy prime minister and prime minister of Kosovo prior to becoming its representative in the Yugoslav Presidency.
Born in Peć, Sapunxhiu was an ethnic Albanian. From 1980 to 1982, he served as prime minister of Kosovo. In 1981, he headed the Kosovar delegation in a historical visit to Albania. This visit paved the way for closer relations between Albania and the Albanian community in Kosovo and the rest of Yugoslavia.
As a successful economist, in 1982, Sapunxhiu became an official at the World Bank.
When the Yugoslav crisis began, he supported the territorial integrity of Yugoslavia but did not effectually vote, though he was registered as voting pro. Nevertheless, the state of emergency was not declared due to opposition by other members of the presidency.

Buud Yam is a 1997 Burkinabé historical drama film written and directed by Gaston Kaboré. It is the sequel to the film Wend Kuuni. As of 2001, it was the most popular African film ever in Burkina Faso.
The title's meaning is unclear: buud can mean both "ancestors" and "descendants", while yam means "spirit" or "intelligence." It has been translated as Soul of the Group.
Plot
The film draws on the African oral tradition. Set in a nineteenth century village, it follows a group of characters from Kaboré's debut film Wend Kuuni. Wend Kuuni (Serge Yanogo) is a young man who is suspected of being responsible, through the use of sorcery, for his adopted sister's ill health. To help his sister, and clear his name, he tries to find a healer who uses the legendary "lion's herbs". He also searches for his own roots.
Distribution and awards
In 1997, Buud Yam was shown at the Cannes Film Festival during Directors Fortnight and had its North American premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival. It won the Etalon de Yennega (the Grand Prize) at the 15th Ouagadougou Panafrican Film and Television Festival.

Background
"Sweet Love " was a ballad that heralded a move away from their initial stone cold funk sound.
The six-minute album version is noted for Richie's half-sung, half-spoken recitation before the song's refrain repeats to the fade out.
Reception
Cash Box said that it has "close, colorful, harmonious vocal lines and smooth, flowing musical arrangement."

The Sicherheitspolizei (), often abbreviated as SiPo, was a term used in Germany for security police. In the Nazi era, it referred to the state political and criminal investigation security agencies. It was made up by the combined forces of the Gestapo (secret state police) and the Kriminalpolizei (criminal police; Kripo) between 1936 and 1939. As a formal agency, the SiPo was incorporated into the Reich Security Main Office (RSHA) in 1939, but the term continued to be used informally until the end of World War II in Europe.
Origins
The term originated in August 1919 when the Reichswehr set up the Sicherheitswehr as a militarised police force to take action during times of riots or strikes. Owing to limitations in army numbers, it was renamed the Sicherheitspolizei to avoid attention. They wore a green uniform, and were sometimes called the "Green Police". It was a military body, recruiting largely from the Freikorps, with NCOs and officers from the old German Imperial Army.
Nazi era
When the Nazis came to national power in 1933, Germany, as a federal state, had myriad local and centralized police agencies, which often were un-coordinated and had overlapping jurisdictions. Heinrich Himmler and Reinhard Heydrich's plan was to fully absorb all the police and security apparatus into the structure of the Schutzstaffel (SS). To this end, Himmler took command first of the Gestapo (itself developed from the Prussian Secret Police). Then on 17 June 1936 all police forces throughout Germany were united, following Adolf Hitler's appointment of Himmler as Chef der Deutschen Polizei (Chief of German Police). As such he was nominally subordinate to Interior Minister Wilhelm Frick, but in practice Himmler answered only to Hitler.
Himmler immediately reorganised the police, with the state agencies statutorily divided into two groups: the Ordnungspolizei (Order Police; Orpo), consisting of both the national uniformed police and the municipal police, and the Sicherheitspolizei (Security Police; SiPo), consisting of the Kripo and Gestapo. Heydrich was appointed chief of the SiPo and was already head of the party Sicherheitsdienst (Security Service; SD) and the Gestapo. The two police branches were commonly known as the Orpo and SiPo (Kripo and Gestapo combined), respectively.
The idea was to fully identify and integrate the party agency (SD) with the state agency (SiPo). Most of the SiPo members were encouraged or volunteered to become members of the SS and many held a rank in both organisations. Nevertheless, in practice there was jurisdictional overlap and operational conflict between the SD and Gestapo. The Kripo kept a level of independence since its structure was longer-established. Himmler founded the Hauptamt Sicherheitspolizei in order to create a centralized main office under Heydrich's overall command of the SiPo.
The Einsatzgruppen were formed under the direction of Heydrich and operated by the SS under the SiPo and SD. The Einsatzgruppen had its origins in the ad hoc Einsatzkommando formed by Heydrich to secure government buildings and documents following the Anschluss in Austria in March 1938. Originally part of the SiPo, two units of Einsatzgruppen were stationed in the Sudetenland in October 1938. When military action turned out not to be necessary because of the Munich Agreement, the Einsatzgruppen were assigned to confiscate government papers and police documents. They also secured government buildings, questioned senior civil servants, and arrested as many as 10,000 Czech communists and German citizens.
Merger
In September 1939, with the founding of the Reich Security Main Office (Reichssicherheitshauptamt; RSHA), the Sicherheitspolizei as a functioning state agency ceased to exist as the department was merged into the RSHA. Further, the RSHA obtained overall command of the Einsatzgruppen units from that time forward. Members of the Einsatzgruppen units at this point were drawn from the SS, the SD and the police. They were used during the invasion of Poland to forcefully de-politicise the Polish people and murder members of groups most clearly identified with Polish national identity: the intelligentsia, members of the clergy, teachers, and members of the nobility. When the units were re-formed prior to the invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941, the men of the Einsatzgruppen were recruited from the SD, Gestapo, Kripo, Orpo and Waffen-SS. These mobile death squads were active in the implementation of the Final Solution in the territories overrun by the Nazi forces.

Terra Nostra () is a Brazilian telenovela, produced and broadcast by Rede Globo in 1999. The telenovela is written by Benedito Ruy Barbosa and directed by Jayme Monjardim.
The story is set in the late 19th century and takes place at a time when slaves were freed in Brazil and there was a need for workers, especially on Brazilian coffee fazendas (plantations). This partly resulted many Italians migrating to Brazil, looking for employment and a better life. Unlike many other telenovela stories, the characters are not larger than life in "Terra Nostra." Instead, they are everyday people who make ordinary decisions. Consequently, the viewers can relate to what is happening in the story.
Musical director Marcus Viana compiled several traditional Italian songs, performed by musicians such as Charlotte Church, Caetano Veloso, Zizi Possi, and Jerry Adriani. The soundtrack also includes original instrumental music by Viana.
Plot
The telenovela takes place in Brazil between the end of nineteenth century and early twentieth century. This historical telenovela tells the story of these Italian immigrants. It focuses on the relationship of Giuliana Esplendore (Ana Paula Arosío) and Matteo Batistela (Thiago Lacerda) who meet each other during the voyage to Brazil. Most of the story takes place in a coffee farm in São Paulo.
Giuliana and Matteo immediately fall in love and plan a life together. Unfortunately, fate and some people do not plan it that way. A series of mishaps befall the couple and keep them apart. When they finally reunite, their conduct affects not only their lives, but also other people they have met along the way.
After docking, Giuliana and Matteo became lost and followed different paths. She is welcomed by Francesco (Raul Cortez), a banker millionaire friend of his deceased parents. Francesco is married to Jeanett, an haughty and arrogant woman, and father of Marco Antonio, a bon vivant.
Matteo meanwhile works on the farm of Gumercindo (Antonio Fagundes), a coffee baron who is married to Maria do Socorro. While he is a loving father to his daughter Angélica, he is cruel to his other daughter, Rosana (Carolina Kasting).
Marco Antonio, son of Francesco, falls madly in love with Giuliana, who rejects him in her determination to find her love, Matteo. However, when she discovers Matteo is expecting a son, Marco Antonio there sees the chance to be with her. Marco asks Giuliana to marry him and, in fear, she accepts.
Meanwhile, on the farm of Gumercindo, Matteo's charm enchants Angélica and Rosana. While Angélica is a shy girl, Rosana is impulsive and has strong personality. Rosana invests in Matteo despite being repeatedly rejected by him. However, to force Matteo to marry her, Rosana seduces Matteo and makes love with him. To Angélica Angelica join the convent, Gumercindo accepts the wedding proposal of Augusto, a young man with dreams of becoming a politician.
Augusto, however, maintains an affair with Paola, a beautiful and fiery Italian who arrived in the same ship that Matteo and Giuliana had. Anacleto, her father, forces Augusto to take responsibility of Paola and Augusto and purchases a home for the her in São Paulo, living together without being married. Subsequently Angélica and Augusto marry and move to São Paulo, and Paola becomes Angelica's friend. In realizing that Augusto is happily married, Paola relinquishes her hope of marrying him.
Gumercindo approaches Francesco with a business proposition. At this point, Matteo is already married with Rosana, with whom he is expecting a son, and Giuliana had a daughter, Annie, with Marco. But when the real desires of Giuliana and Matteo's son is uncovered, the marriage of Francesco and Jeanette falls apart, and Giuliana also separates from Marco.
The story concludes with Giuliana marrying Matteo and them expecting a child together, and Matteo adopts Aniña.
Moral issues arise which produce fruitful debate for the television viewers. There are no simple answers because none of the characters or issues are strictly right or wrong, black or white. The issues and personalities are gray and will cause the viewers to change their minds during the storyline.

London Drugs Ltd v Kuehne & Nagel International Ltd, [1992] 3 SCR 299 is a leading decision of the Supreme Court of Canada on privity of contract.
Background
Kuehne & Nagel was storing a transformer owned by London Drugs valued at $32,000. The agreement between the parties included a limitation of liability clause which limited liability for damage to the transformer to $40. Two employees were moving the transformer with a forklift and negligently dropped it.
London Drugs sued the two employees on the basis that they owed a separate duty of care and could not seek protection under the contract.
The courts below
London Drugs succeeded at first instance at the British Columbia Supreme Court, where the trial judge found the employees personally liable for the full amount of the damages, limiting the company's liability to $40. That judgment was reversed in part on appeal to the British Columbia Court of Appeal, where, in a majority decision, the employees' liability was reduced to $40.
London Drugs appealed this decision and the respondent employees cross‑appealed, arguing that they should be completely free of liability.
At the Supreme Court of Canada
The appeal was dismissed in a 6–0 ruling, while the cross-appeal was dismissed 5–1.
The majority opinion
Iacobucci J, writing for the majority, observed:
While the employees were liable in negligence, they were able to gain protection under the contract. Employees are able to gain protection where:
the limitation of liability clause must, either expressly or impliedly, extend its benefit to the employee(s) seeking to rely on it; and
the employee(s) seeking the benefit of the limitation of liability clause must have been acting in the course of their employment and must have been performing the very services provided for in the contract between their employer and the plaintiff when the loss occurred.
Concurrence by McLachlin
McLachlin J concurred, but for different reasons. Tort and contract constitute separate legal regimes, and the appellant's action against the employees in this case is necessarily in tort, since there was no contract between them. The theory of voluntary assumption of the risk permits an employee sued in tort to rely on a term of limitation in his employer's contract. The plaintiff, having agreed to the limitation of liability vis à vis the employer, must be taken to have done so with respect to the employer's employees.
Concurrence/dissent by La Forest
La Forest J, in dissent, believed the respondent employees did not owe any duty of care to the appellant in the circumstances of this case. He applied the "Anns test" as formulated by the House of Lords, which asks:
Is there a sufficient relationship of proximity, such that carelessness on his part may be likely to cause damage to the latter (in which case, a prima facie duty of care arises)?
If so, are there any considerations which ought to reduce or limit
the scope of the duty,
the class of person to whom it is owed, or
the damages to which a breach of it may give rise?
In the present case, the first question is answered in the affirmative. As to the second, he felt that the vicarious liability regime is best seen as a response to a number of policy concerns:
It is not merely a mechanism by which the employer guarantees the employee's primary liability, but has the broader function of transferring to the enterprise itself the risks created by the activity performed by its agents.
Elimination of the possibility of the employee bearing the loss is not only logically compatible with the vicarious liability regime, it is practically compelled by the developing logic of that regime.
The employer will almost always be insured against the risk of being held liable to third parties by reason of his vicarious liability. Therefore, its cost is thus internalized to the profitable activity that gives rise to it.
There is no requirement for double insurance, covering both the employee and his employer against the same risk.
Further, imposing tort liability on the employee in these circumstances cannot be justified by the need to deter careless behaviour. An employee subjects himself to discipline or dismissal by a refusal to perform work as instructed by the employer, and the employer is free to establish contractual schemes of contribution from negligent employees.
Finally, the elimination of employee liability will have no impact on the plaintiff's compensation in the vast majority of cases.
The employee remains liable to the plaintiff for his independent torts. An independent tort may fall within or outside the range of the employer's liability under the vicarious liability regime. In that regard, the following questions must be answered:
Is the tort alleged against the employee an independent tort or a tort related to a contract between the employer and the plaintiff? In answering this question, it is legitimate to consider the scope of the contract, the nature of the employee's conduct and the nature of the plaintiff's interest.
If the alleged tort is independent, the employee is liable to the plaintiff if the elements of the tort action are proved. The liability of the company to the plaintiff is determined under the ordinary rules applicable to cases of vicarious liability.
If the tort is related to the contract, the next question to be resolved is whether any reliance by the plaintiff on the employee was reasonable. The question here is whether the plaintiff reasonably relied on the eventual legal responsibility of the defendants under the circumstances.
Since the conduct of the employees was covered by the contract, the plaintiffs were considered to have voluntarily assumed the risk of their tortious behaviour. The plaintiffs could not have reasonably relied on the employees and, thus, the employees were shielded from liability.
Aftermath
There has been much discussion about the nature of the ruling in two areas:
the duty of care by employees to other parties, and
vicarious liability
The majority ruling, which shielded the employees' liability by virtue of contractual terms, has invited discussion as to the effect where such shielding is not in place.
La Forest J's discussion of vicarious liability has influenced subsequent Supreme Court decisions on that doctrine, most notably Bazley v Curry, which has had significant influence in the jurisprudence of other Commonwealth jurisdictions including the UK House of Lords in its ruling in .

Shevlin was an unincorporated community in Deschutes and Klamath counties in the U.S. state of Oregon. It consisted of a collection of logging camp buildings that were moved from place to place on rail cars as logging progressed. The loggers worked for the Shevlin–Hixson Company.
Background
Some of its known locations from north to south included a spot about south of Lava Butte and about east of U.S. Route 97 and a second place about southeast of La Pine, both in Deschutes County. The community then moved to Summit Stage Station on Oregon Route 31 in northeastern Klamath County near its border with Lake County. The Geographic Names Information System places the community in the Fremont–Winema National Forest southeast of Chemult.
Shevlin post office opened in 1931 with William J. Baer as the first postmaster. By 1936, the post office had moved to Klamath County, where it continued until 1951. After that, mail to Shevlin went to the post office in Chemult.

Quintus Egrilius Plarianus was a Roman senator, who was active during the reigns of Antoninus Pius and Marcus Aurelius. He was suffect consul for one of the nundinia in the first half of AD 144, as the colleague of Lucius Aemilius Carus. Plarianus was the son of Marcus Acilius Priscus Egrilius Plarianus; he also is known to have had a sister, Egrilia M.f. Plaria. Although his family had its origins in Ostia, it is likely he spent most of his life in Rome.
Plarianus is known to have been governor of Moesia superior from c.152 to c.155 and proconsular governor of Africa. An inscription from Avitta Bibba (now in Tunisia) attests he was governor of that province in the year 159, with his son Quintus Egrilius Plarianus as his legate or assistant. While governing Africa, Plarianus received a letter from the literary figure Fronto, recommending one Julius Aquilinus for a job in his administration, praising the young man for his learning and eloquence.

The Matapalo broad-nosed bat, Platyrrhinus matapalensis, is a species of leaf-nosed bat described in 2005. It is found in South America.
Taxonomy and etymology
Before it was described, there were only 10 species recognized in the genus Platyrrhinus.
With the description of P. matapalensis and other species since 2005, the total is now at least 20 species.
P. matapalensis was described as the result of a taxonomic split in Heller's broad-nosed bat, with the "Eastern" populations retaining the name P. helleri, and the "Western" populations described as P. matapalensis.
The holotype for the species was collected in July 1954 in Zarumilla, Peru by Peruvian ornithologist Celestino Kalinowski.
Its species name matapalensis is derived from the Matapalo District, where the holotype was found.
Description
It is a small member of its genus, with a forearm length of .
The fur on its back is light brown, with individual hairs tricolored.
Dorsal hairs are long.
The face is striped and the fur on its belly is brownish, with individual hairs bicolored or unicolored, depending on the individual.
It has a narrow dorsal stripe down the length of its spine that is the same color as its facial stripes.
Its nose-leaf is longer than it is wide.
The margin of the uropatagium is densely furred with a fringe of hairs.
Range and habitat
It is known from the western slopes of the Andes in Ecuador and Peru.
It may occur in northwest Colombia, though no records support this hypothesis yet.
It prefers lowland forests that are undisturbed.
It has been found at elevations of above sea level.
Conservation
It is currently evaluated as near-threatened by the IUCN.
It meets the criteria for this designation because its habitat is undergoing extensive losses in quality and extent.
Its habitat loss has been so dramatic that the species is close to qualifying for vulnerable status.

Kropfenstein Castle is a type of castle known as a cave castle in the municipality of Waltensburg/Vuorz of the Canton of Graubünden in Switzerland. It is a Swiss heritage site of national significance.
History
There are no surviving records indicating when or how this castle was built. From the style of construction it appears to have been built in the 13th century and was in operation until the 15th century. By the 14th century the Counts of Kropfenstein begin to appear in historical records. They appear to have adopted the castle's name when they took up residence there. In addition to the area around the castle, the Counts had close relations with the Herrschaft of Rhäzüns. The Kropfenstein line died out in the 15th century and the castle began to fall into disrepair.
Castle site
The castle is reached through a path that was cut into the rock on the east side. Eventually a parapet was built along the path to prevent falls.
The castle walls follow the edge of the cliff making its shape very irregular. Due to the overhanging rock wall, the castle remains in generally good condition with limited weathering. The castle was three stories tall with embrasures that are still visible on the upper two stories. The exact floor plan of the castle is unknown but it was probably divided into several rooms. The first room is only about wide and was probably used as a store room. The western part of the castle is up to wide and contained the castle living quarters and kitchen. Nothing is known about the castle roof, but it may have been just a canopy to keep rain out.

PERF 558 is the oldest surviving Arabic papyrus, found in Heracleopolis in Egypt, and is also the oldest dated Arabic text using the Islamic era, dating to 643. It is a bilingual Arabic-Greek fragment, consisting of a tax receipt, or as it puts it "Document concerning the delivery of sheep to the Magarites and other people who arrived, as a down-payment of the taxes of the first indiction."
Features of interest include:
The first well-attested use of the disambiguating dots that would become an essential feature of the Arabic alphabet;
It begins with the Greek formula "ev onomati tou teou" (In the Name of God) after a Sign of the Cross
It records the date both in the Islamic calendar (an unspecified day in the month Jumada I, year 22) and in the Coptic calendar (30 Parmouti, 1st indiction), corresponding with 25 April 643 in the Julian calendar.
In Greek, it calls the Arabs "Magaritae", a term, believed to be related to the Arabic "muhajir" often used in the earliest non-Islamic sources. It also calls them "Saracens".
After excavation, the papyrus was put in the Erzherzog Rainer Papyrus Collection in Vienna.
Arabic text
Dots and hamzas added; otherwise, spelling uncorrected.

the month of Jumada I in the year twenty-two. Written by Ibn Hadidu.

George W. Hill (December 13, 1916 – March 3, 2003) was an American Baptist pastor, a peace activist, and a leading liberal Protestant voice who played an important role in the founding of the United States Institute of Peace.
He was born in 1913 in Los Angeles, California. Hill attended the University of Southern California. He died in Claremont, California on March 3, 2003.
Early life
Hill was born in Los Angeles and majored in banking and finance at the University of Southern California. He planned to go law school but was offered a position at the Lake Avenue Baptist Church in Rochester, New York. Through this experience, he decided to enter the ministry and entered Colgate Rochester Divinity School, from which he graduated in 1940. Hill was ordained at Lake Avenue Baptist on May 14, 1940.
Pastoral positions
Hill's first church was Atwater Park Baptist Church in Pasadena where he served as pastor until 1943. He served as youth minister and then co-pastor at First Baptist Church of Pasadena from 1944 to 1954. In 1954, he returned to Lake Avenue Baptist Church in Rochester, where he served as senior pastor until 1971. From 1971 until 1986, he was senior pastor at Calvary Baptist Church in Washington, D.C., which had enough stature to be considered a church for President Jimmy Carter. He retired in 1986, but was called to serve as interim pastor, starting in 1988, at The Riverside Church in New York City, where he focused substantially on resolving fiscal issues at the church. He retired again from full-time ministry in 1989. In addition, Hill served on the board of the American Baptists.
Hill also had a regular television talk-show, The Pastor's Study.
Activism
Hill engaged in a life of social activism grounded in his religious beliefs. For example, in the 40s, he opposed Japanese internment camps. Hill was President of the Rochester Council of Churches during the Rochester 1964 race riot. Many clergy supported political organizing attempts by the Industrial Areas Foundation, although many clergy came under significant pressure for this. This effort brought IAF and the churches into extensive conflict with Eastman Kodak, the leading company in the town. Hill was given the American Baptist's Edwin T. Dahlberg Peace Award for this in 1985
When Hill moved to Washington, D.C. to pastor Calvary Baptist Church, he shifted somewhat to national politics. He came involved in, and eventually chairman, of the National Peace Academy Campaign, which resulted in the United States Institute of Peace. Calvary was also located in a poorer neighborhood, which led to the church opening a homeless shelter in its basement.
After retiring, he was active in Pastors for Peace.
In 1978, Hill led efforts to raise money for the bail of convicted spy Donald Humphrey.

"Blame Canada" is a satirical song from the 1999 animated film South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut, written by Trey Parker & Marc Shaiman. In the song, the parents of the fictional South Park, led by Sheila Broflovski (Mary Kay Bergman), decided to blame Canada for the trouble their children have been getting into since watching the Canadian-made movie Terrance and Phillip: Asses of Fire and imitating what they saw and heard in the movie. "Blame Canada" satirizes scapegoating and parents who do not control "their children's consumption of popular culture". The song was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Original Song at the 72nd Academy Awards. Stone and Parker showed up to the ceremony in dresses and later claimed to be under the influence of LSD while on the red carpet.
An 8-bit remix of the song appears in the 2014 game South Park: The Stick of Truth, included as one of the overworld themes for the Canada level. The song appears again in the game's 2017 sequel, South Park: The Fractured but Whole, near the Canadian wall.
Reception
The song was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Original Song at the 72nd Academy Awards (1999). This created controversy because all nominated songs are traditionally performed during the Oscar broadcast, but the song contained the word fuck, which the FCC prohibits using in prime time broadcasts. At the awards ceremony, comedian Robin Williams performed the song with a chorus that gasped when the word was to be sung (Williams turned around at the crucial moment and did not actually sing it). He included digs at Margaret Trudeau and Bryan Adams, partially taken from lyrics of Sheila Broflovski's reprise of the song in "La Resistance". He referenced Celine Dion as well. Mary Kay Bergman, the voice actress who sang the female parts in the song, died months before the performance, forcing the organizers to search for a replacement for her and Trey Parker, who did the male voices. Williams introduced the song by speaking with duct tape over his mouth so that his speech resembled that of Kenny McCormick, then tearing it off and finally saying Stan Marsh's trademark line, "Oh my god! They killed Kenny!"
There was also some concern about the fact the song referred to well-known Canadian singer Anne Murray as a "bitch", but Murray indicated that she was not offended by the tongue-in-cheek lyric (Murray was invited to sing the song herself on the Oscar telecast but had to decline due to a prior commitment). When asked, the Canadian Consul General (and former prime minister) Kim Campbell said that she was not offended by the song since it was clearly a silly satirical piece and not intended to insult her country. This is made clear in the final line of the song:
We must blame them and cause a fuss.Before somebody thinks of blaming us!
Coincidentally, the Canadian Oscar telecast in which Williams sang the song included the premiere of the "I Am Canadian" rant advertisement, which counters many perceived Canadian stereotypes.
The Oscar was instead awarded to Phil Collins' song "You'll Be in My Heart" from Tarzan, which was parodied on an episode of South Park released the following year, "Timmy 2000", as "You'll Be in Me".

The Copenhagen Fire of 1795 (Københavns brandes 1795) started on Friday, 5 June 1795, at or around 3 pm by the Navy's old base south east of Kongens Nytorv on Gammelholm, in the Navy's magazine for coal and timber, the so-called Dellehave. As the workers had already gone home, a considerable length of time passed before efforts to combat the fire started, and out of fear for theft, the fire hydrants had been removed. The people of Holmen also blocked the civilian fire brigade, possibly in the belief that since it was a military area, the military should take care of it.
There had been an extended period without rain and the dry wood, combined with the storage of rope work and tar, made the fire spread quickly. The wind blew especially strong from east-southeast, and that meant the countless embers were carried through the air into the city. Because of the strong sunlight, small fires were difficult to detect until they have taken hold. This is why the fire spread from Gammelholm to the main magazine along Holmens Canal (Holmens Kanal Danish) and over Holmens Canal to the quarter around Saint Nicolai Church and from there, along Gammel Strand to the area around Nytorv/Gammeltorv.
The fire at Nicolai Church
Right by Saint Nicolai Church, after the Copenhagen Fire of 1728, infrastructure to fight fires had been constructed because the area was very densely built up. A basin that could hold 400 barrels of water had been excavated for use. In addition, a pumping station was built that could pump water through an 800-foot-long hose. The pumps were able to raise the pressure to such a level that it could deliver one barrel of water per minute from the hose. But when a spark set fire to the church tower, nobody could find the key to the door of the pumping station. Only some time later did anyone think of kicking the door in. By then, the fire had already taken hold and the residents in the surrounding quarter were panicked. The road became so full of people, who were also transporting furniture to safety from the fire, that the water hoses could not be brought close to the fire. Soon the church burned to the ground, and with it the pumps. At that point, the Saint Nicolai quarter could not be saved.
Fighting the fire
The majority of the residents in the area threatened by the fire chose to flee, but in some places residents chose to stay in their houses and fight the fire. This happened in the first three to four houses on the north side of Østergade. Here people spread themselves throughout the houses both inside and out, armed with buckets and plenty of water. This prevented the fire from taking hold and saved the neighbouring street of Købmagergade at the same time, since it would inevitably have spread to there as well.
Royal advisor Carsten Anker (Danish title: konferensråd) had his mansion on the corner of Vingårdsstræde and Kongens Nytorv saved by covering both it and a connected building with a sail that constantly had water poured on it.
Supreme Court Justice Peter Uldall (Danish title: justitsråd) saved his mansion in Vimmelskaftet by paying a large party to stay and put out any embers. It also prevented the fire from spreading to the northern side of the plaza, so only the southern side burned down.
Consequences
The fire died out on Sunday, 7 July, around 4 pm. It had destroyed 909 houses and partially damaged 74. Just over 6,000 of the just under 100,000 residents in the capital were made homeless. A large number of them took refuge in the ruins of the recently burned-down Christianborgs Castle, the remaining walls of which were so large that an entire family could move into a window niche. The stables were also used as housing.
The fire had, together with Copenhagen's fire of 1728, in effect burned down almost the whole of Copenhagen's medieval and Renaissance heritage and so only a few houses from before the 18th century remain in that part of the city. More historic buildings in Copenhagen would be lost to fire in 1807 when the city was bombarded by the British.
The fire was a strong contributing factor to the foundation of Denmark's first credit institution, Kreditkassen for Husejerne i Kjøbenhavn, in 1797.
After the fire, a large-scale plan was designed by the city planner Jørgen Henrich Rawert and the construction master Peter Meyn. The plan dictated the newly constructed houses should be made of masonry (instead of being timber framed) and house corners at intersections should be diagonal and the streets straightened so that the fire department's long ladder companies could navigate the streets more easily.

Eldred Pottinger (12 August 181115 November 1843) was an Anglo-Indian army officer and diplomat. In 1837 he happened to be in Herat in Afghanistan to gather intelligence on the area when the Persian army, supported by Russians, laid siege to the city. He helped the Afghan commander repulse the Persians, and was subsequently dubbed the "Hero of Herat" by British historians.
Life
Pottinger was born on the 12 August 1811 in Ireland. He was the eldest son of Thomas Pottinger of Mount Pottinger, County Down (now in Northern Ireland), and Charlotte Moore. He was educated at Addiscombe Military Seminary (1826–1827) and entered the Bombay Artillery in 1827. After some years of regimental duty he was appointed to the political department under his uncle, Colonel (afterwards Sir) Henry Pottinger.
In 1837 he made a journey through Afghanistan in disguise. Arriving at Herat, he found it threatened by a Persian army (with whom were some Russian officers) and immediately made himself known to the Afghan commander, offering his services. The attack which soon followed was conducted with vigour, but the defence, inspired by Pottinger, was ultimately successful, and after a year the siege was lifted.
For this service Pottinger was thanked by the governor-general, the Earl of Auckland, made brevet-major, and also received the C.B. He was also appointed Political Officer at Herat. In 1841 he was political officer in Kohistan when the revolt against Shah Shuja broke out there. Taking refuge with the Gurkha garrison of Charikar, Major Pottinger withstood a siege of fourteen days, and then made an adventurous retreat to Kabul. Less than a fortnight after his arrival Sir William Macnaghten was murdered, and Pottinger succeeded to his position as envoy to the Afghan court. The apathy of the military leaders made resistance hopeless, and it only remained to negotiate for the withdrawal of the British army. Pottinger himself was one of the hostages handed over to Akbar Khan, and thus escaped the near-total massacre of the retreating British and Sepoy troops in the evacuation from Kabul to Jelalabad in January 1842. Released, after some months in captivity, by Sir George Pollock's army, he returned to India.
Pottinger died on 15 November 1843 in Hong Kong while visiting his uncle Henry Pottinger, the first Governor of Hong Kong. He is commemorated by a cenotaph in St. Thomas Cathedral, Mumbai.
Historiography
Pottinger's role in the siege of Harat was picked up by 19th-century British historiography, which described him as a genius of defensive sieges, and dubbed him the "Hero of Herat", as part of a propaganda campaign aiming to show the power of the British military, and to secure British domination in the Middle East and Asia.

CryptoPunks is a non-fungible token (NFT) collection on the Ethereum blockchain. The project was launched in June 2017 by the Larva Labs studio, a two-person team consisting of Canadian software developers Matt Hall and John Watkinson. The experimental project was inspired by the London punk scenes, the cyberpunk movement, and electronic music artists Daft Punk. The crypto art blockchain project was an inspiration for the ERC-721 standard for NFTs and the modern crypto art movement, which has since become a part of the cryptocurrency and decentralized finance ecosystems on multiple blockchains.
CryptoPunks are commonly credited with starting the NFT craze of 2021, along with other early projects including CryptoKitties, Bored Ape Yacht Club, and the sale of Beeple's Everydays: The First 5000 Days. There are 10,000 CryptoPunk tokens in both the V1 and V2 contracts. Due to their rarity and exclusivity, they sell for higher prices on the open market and have sold using auction houses like Christie's. On March 2, 2022, an anonymous user donated CryptoPunk #5364 to Ukraine's government Ethereum wallet public address to help fund the Ukrainian government against the Russian invasion of Ukraine.
On March 11, 2022 it was announced that all of the CryptoPunks IP was acquired by Yuga Labs (parent company and creators of the Bored Ape Yacht Club project) for an undisclosed sum. Immediately, Yuga Labs announced they were giving full commercial rights to CryptoPunks owners. On 7th May 2022 the transfer was completed, and the whole CryptoPunks marketplace was moved to the new Yuga Labs owned website.
Concept
There are 10,000 unique CryptoPunks (6,039 male and 3,840 female), all of which are made digitally scarce through the use of blockchain technology. Each one was algorithmically generated through computer code and thus no two characters are exactly alike, with some traits being rarer than others. They were originally released for free and could be claimed by anyone with an Ethereum wallet. The only costs to claim a CryptoPunk during their initial release were Ethereum (ETH) "gas fees", which at the time, were negligible due to little use of both the Ethereum blockchain and little knowledge of the project as well.
Certain traits and types of characters are rarer than others. While many projects of more recent development often sample through hundreds of possible traits, the CryptoPunks project was not as complex. Most of the 10,000 total punks are humans, but there are also three special types: Zombie (88), Ape (24), and Alien (9). Aside from character type, there was a potential of 87 additional attributes.
Controversies
Flash loan
In October 2021, a single NFT transaction was made for 124,457 Ether ($532 million USD at the time of the sale) regarding CryptoPunk #9998, much higher than all previous NFT sales, leading to speculation on social media that this could have been some kind of scam, a security exploit or money laundering. Larva Labs said that the purchase was made with a flash loan where the NFT's owner bought the item from themselves with borrowed money, taking out and repaying the loan within a single blockchain transaction, subsequently invalidating the sale from the asset's historic and from all the related statistics.
Sotheby's 104 CryptoPunks auction
In early 2022, a Sotheby's Auction for a single lot of 104 CryptoPunks was announced. The auction took place on 23 February 2022, but its seller (0x650d) changed their mind 23 minutes after the auction began and decided to withdraw the auction to keep the whole lot.

Creeps is a 2013 young adult novel that was written by Darren Hynes. It was first published in Canada on July 30, 2013 through RazorBill.
Synopsis
Wayne is a teenager growing up in a dysfunctional home. His father is an alcoholic and his mother keeps threatening to desert him all. He can't escape his home life in school either, as Wayne is constantly bullied by his schoolmate Pete "The Meat". One morning he's rescued by Marjorie, a teen girl dealing with her own problematic home life, and the two begin to befriend one another. However even as the two seek solace in one another, Pete has decided to take matters into his own hands and find a way to torment not only Wayne but Marjorie as well.
Reception
Quill and Quire panned Creeps overall, criticizing Hynes for "[rehashing] familiar caricatures" and that "aside from Wayne's fear of daily menace and a subplot involving a play that almost doesn't go on, there's not a lot to the story." CM Magazine also heavily criticized Creeps, stating that "the writing style is not terribly problematic in itself—though the first-person unsent letters are a bit jarring and don't always flow with the rest of the narration—however the failure of Hynes to move beyond stereotypes and flat adult characters—with the possible exception of Mr. Rollie, the drama teacher, and Mr. Ricketts, the janitor—keeps the story from moving beyond a limited exploration of a very haunted group of young people.

Really Red was one of Houston, Texas' first punk bands and existed from the late 1970s through 1985.
Biography
The Really Red line up consisted of John Paul Williams on bass guitar, Ronnie "U-Ron" Bond vocalist/lyricist, Bob Weber on drums and Kelly Younger on guitar. Under occasional variations of their names, these were the original and only band members. Really Red evolved into one of the most prominent and popular Texas punk bands of that era and helped to kick-start the early punk scene in Houston and Texas. Really Red toured the United States several times and played some dates in Canada, including a benefit for the Squamish Five in Vancouver.
Along with their "paying gigs" they were known to do benefit shows for causes as diverse as The Nuclear Freeze Campaign, the Canadian Squamish Five Legal Defense, KPFT radio or even for a vet bill for an injured dog. They started their own independent record label, C.I.A. Records. Really Red toured extensively with DOA and Articles of Faith. They also were billed with many bands of note including, but not limited to, John Cale, Dead Kennedys, SPK, the Effigies, Red Tide, Bad Brains, Circle Jerks, Stranglers, Dayglo Abortions, 999, Big Boys, The Dicks, MDC, Negative Approach, the Butthole Surfers, Sado Nation, Die Kreuzen, Personality Crisis, Culturcide, Mark Arm's Mr Epp and also the Fastbacks. On special rare occasions Austrian avant-garde filmmaker, Kurt Kren, would project his films as a backdrop for the band's performance.
They released their first 45 single recording, Crowd Control/Corporate Settings in 1979. Among their many accomplishments, Really Red were the first Texas punk band to tour extensively outside of Texas. In addition they were the first Texas punk band to have a full length album distributed nationally; Teaching You the Fear was released in 1981. The title track cited the murders of three men by members of the Houston police department; a Black Panther activist Carl Hampton, a Latino man Joe Campos Torres, and a gay man Fred Paez. Rest in Pain Really Red's second album was released in 1985 and most of side two departed from the punk genre into a dark soundscape that was a homage to the Red Crayola's "Parable of Arable Land" album.. Really Red broke up in 1985 after releasing 2 albums, 2 45 singles, 2 7" EP's, and tracks on various compilations.
Their song "Prostitution" appeared on the Alternative Tentacles compilation album Let Them Eat Jellybeans. The song "Nobody Rules" was included on the compilation Cottage Cheese from the Lips of Death. That version was intended for their Rest in Pain album but due to a mix up it ended up on
"Cottage Cheese" while the alternative version intended for that release showed up on "Rest in Pain". The song "Modern Needs" was included on Rhino Records compilation "Faster and Louder Hardcore Punk Vol 1". Their cover of Petula Clark's "Downtown" was included on the 1996 7" 45 "Rather See You Dead: Houston Punk 1978-1979" from the Hot Box Review label. The song "I was a Teenage Fuckup" appeared on the soundtrack to the film American Hardcore. Their 1st single's A side "Crowd Control" was included on the bootleg album release Killed by Death Vol 2 while both sides of the single were legally included on the compilation album Deep in the Throat of Texas. Their 2nd single A side "Modern Needs" was included on the bootleg album release Killed by Death Vol 4.
The 1981 LP "Teaching You The Fear" was re-issued on Empty Records in 2004.
2015 saw the reissue of all of Really Red's material, as well as unreleased rarities, by the Alternative Tentacles label. This release came as a two CD set "Teaching You The Fear: The Complete Collection" and three full length vinyl albums (see below).
For years, as well as fronting Really Red, lead singer U-Ron (as Perry Coma) created and hosted the original "Funhouse" radio show, on Pacifica's Houston station KPFT.
The only member to continue making music has been drummer Bob Weber who did a California tour with the notorious Culturcide and then joined The Anarchitex. Both bands were also from Houston Texas.
2020 saw Teaching You the Fear... Again a tribute album released with contributions from bands including Sugar Shack, Verbal Abuse, The Hickoids, Mudhoney, Gary Floyd/Dicks, Jello Biafra, The Bellrays, Darwin's Finches and MDC among many other notable groups.

Todd Schmitz (born 1978) is an American swimming coach. He lives in Aurora, Colorado. He is the head coach of the Denver-area club team, the Colorado Stars, which is the training program of 17-year-old swimming phenomenon Missy Franklin, a 2012 U.S. Olympic Team member. Following the 2012 United States Olympic Trials, Schmitz was named to the 2012 U.S. Olympic women's swimming team as an assistant coach.
Schmitz is a native of North Dakota and a graduate of Metropolitan State University of Denver, where he swam for the now-defunct Metro State Roadrunners swim team. After graduation from Metro State, he worked as a junior executive with a national restaurant chain; he quit to accept a full-time job as the under-8 coach of the Colorado Stars, a club team with about 130 young swimmers. Missy Franklin was among his first class of age-group swimmers. With Franklin and his other swimmers, he has employed an atypical approach, emphasizing the need to avoid burnout, rather than pushing his young athletes' bodies to their physical limits as most other elite coaches do. "It's hard to argue with his success," said Gregg Troy, the head coach of the 2012 U.S. Olympic men's swim team.

Metalcut was a relief printmaking technique, belonging to the category of old master prints. It was almost entirely restricted to the period from about 1450 to 1540, and mostly to the region around the Rhine in Northern Europe, the Low Countries, Germany, France and Switzerland; the technique perhaps originated in the area around Cologne.
Technique
There were two different techniques for making metalcut prints, with very different results.
The first technique is essentially that of woodcut but using a thin metal plate rather than a wooden block. The areas not to print are cut away, or hammered back with punches. These prints look very much like normal woodcuts of the period, and it can sometimes be hard for experts to tell them apart. The subject matter is almost entirely religious in the early period, which mostly consists of single prints for display or collecting, and mostly ornamental in the 16th century revival, which mostly consists of illustrations and borders for books. There was a late flowering of the original method around 1500 in France, with a series of lavish Books of Hours. In the sixteenth century the technique continued to be used for elaborate borders and initial letters in books, notably by Jacob Faber, who often used designs by Hans Holbein the Younger.
The second technique, was introduced in the second half of the 15th century and worked from black to white, meaning that the print showed white lines on a black background, rather than the other way round as in the first technique. Again prints were nearly always on religious subjects. Usually the main lines of the figures and landscape were done in engraving. Then using metalwork punches, the rest of the image is composed of repeated use of the same pattern of punch in a particular area. These might be dots, circles, lozenges, stars, letters making text inscriptions, or more complicated shapes for the borders. Usually very little space is left undecorated; and this technique is easy to recognise. These prints ceased to be produced about 1500. The plates themselves may have been treated as works of art in plaque form, with printed impressions a useful by-product; in some cases inscriptions print in reverse, though others do not. Some copper plates survive, often with nail-holes at the corners.
As with the other contemporary print techniques, very few metal cut prints have survived. Prints made by the second technique are sometimes called prints in the dotted manner, or dotted prints, Schrotblatt in German and Manière criblée in French.
It was also possible to combine the techniques on the same plate, with figures using black lines, and backgrounds with punched white dots on a black background. French printed books of hours from the end of the century often use such combinations.
Practitioners
Despite the limitations of the technique, many of the artists who used the second technique were very talented, and the best prints have considerable power. Compared to contemporary engravings and woodcuts, they were usually large, as the technique needed space on the plate. No names are known of the artists; presumably most of them were trained as goldsmiths, as the punch shapes used were typical ones from goldsmithing.

Bartholomew County is a county located in the U.S. state of Indiana. The population was 82,208 at the 2020 census. The county seat is Columbus. The county was determined by the U.S. Census Bureau to be home to the mean center of U.S. population in 1900.
Bartholomew County makes up the Columbus, Indiana Metropolitan Statistical Area, which is part of the Indianapolis-Carmel-Muncie Combined Statistical Area.
History
Bartholomew County was formed on February 12, 1821, and was named for Lt. Col. Joseph Bartholomew, wounded at the Battle of Tippecanoe. The site of the county seat was chosen on February 15, 1821, by a team of commissioners, who suggested the name Tiptona, in honor of John Tipton.
Courthouse
The current Bartholomew County courthouse was built from 1870 to 1874 by McCormack and Sweeney of Columbus at a cost of $225,000.
It was designed by architect Isaac Hodgson, who was born in Belfast, Ireland in 1826 and immigrated to the United States in 1848; he designed six Indiana courthouses, including the one in Henry County.
The courthouse is built largely of brick and has mansard roofs typical of the Second Empire French style. Its asymmetrical "L" shape allows it to face two major streets in Columbus. The inscription indicating the commissioners, architect and date is high up on the east facade.
Today the Bartholomew County Veterans Memorial designed by American architect Charles Rose sits adjacent to the Courthouse.
Geography
According to the 2010 census, the county has a total area of , of which (or 99.36%) is land and (or 0.64%) is water. Camp Atterbury occupies the northwestern corner of the county.

County Council: The county council is the legislative branch of the county government and controls all the spending and revenue collection in the county. Representatives are elected from county districts. The council members serve four-year terms. They are responsible for setting salaries, the annual budget, and special spending. The council also has limited authority to impose local taxes, in the form of an income and property tax that is subject to state level approval, excise taxes, and service taxes.
Board of Commissioners: The executive body of the county is made of a board of commissioners. The commissioners are elected county-wide, in staggered terms, and each serves a four-year term. One of the commissioners, typically the most senior, serves as president. The commissioners are charged with executing the acts legislated by the council, collecting revenue, and managing the day-to-day functions of the county government.
Court: The county maintains a small claims court that can handle some civil cases. The judge on the court is elected to a term of four years and must be a member of the Indiana Bar Association. The judge is assisted by a constable who is also elected to a four-year term. In some cases, court decisions can be appealed to the state level circuit court.
County Officials: The county has several other elected offices, including sheriff, coroner, auditor, treasurer, recorder, surveyor, and circuit court clerk. Each of these elected officers serves a term of four years and oversees a different part of county government. Members elected to county government positions are required to declare a party affiliation and to be residents of the county.

Pickettywitch was a British pop group. Fronted by singer Polly Brown (also billed as Polly Browne), the group became best known for its hit single, "That Same Old Feeling", which was written by Tony Macaulay and John Macleod. It reached number five in the UK Singles Chart in 1970.
Origins
The original members were Polly Brown (vocals), Chris Warren (vocals), Bob Brittain (organ), Martin Bridges (guitar), Mike Tomich (bass guitar) and Keith Hall (drums). Bridges and Tomich were replaced later in 1970 by Peter Hawkins (died 18 October 2014) (guitar) and Brian Stuart (bass), who would later be replaced by Paul Risi (guitar) and Paul Riordan (bass). The name Pickettywitch is often said to have been taken from a Cornish village through which their eventual lead singer, Polly Brown, had passed with her sister; in fact, there is no such village, though there was a pub of that name at Yeovil in Somerset.
History
Pickettywitch was signed by record producer John Macleod to Pye Records and released their debut single, "You Got Me So I Don't Know" b/w "Solomon Grundy" in July 1969.
Their U.K. chart breakthrough came in early 1970 when the single "That Same Old Feeling" hit the top 5. That single also made the top 40 on the Cashbox pop chart in the US a few months later and remains their only hit single there.
Two further singles also made the UK chart in that year - these were "(It's Like A) Sad Old Kinda Movie" (again written by Macaulay and Macleod) (number 16), and "Baby I Won't Let You Down" (written by Les Reed and Geoff Stephens) (number 27).
In 1970, "Days I Remember" received radio airplay. The single did not appear on record charts, but "That Same Old Feeling" reached No. 67 on the Billboard Hot 100 and No. 40 on the Cashbox pop chart in the summer of that same year. Brown left for a solo career in late 1972.
Subsequent careers
Brown went on to a form a duo called Sweet Dreams, in partnership with Tony Jackson, recording a cover of the ABBA song "Honey, Honey". Brown then launched a solo career, with minor hits in the UK and the United States. Hall joined Gerry & the Pacemakers for five years, and has an active international career as a jazz drummer.
Brown continues to write and record music including blues material. There is a misconception that she died in 2006, this being due to the death that year of Sheila Rossall, who had been the lead singer of a latter-day edition of Pickettywitch who worked the club circuit. Rossall had attracted some publicity in 1981 because she suffered from total allergy syndrome, and Brown often faced questions about the illness as a result.

The Coast Guard Administration of the Ocean Affairs Council (CGA; ), also known as the Taiwan Coast Guard or R.O.C. Coast Guard, is charged with maintaining law and order, protecting the resources of the territorial waters of the Republic of China (Taiwan), which surrounds Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen, Matsu Islands, Green Island, Orchid Island, Pratas Island (Tungsha/Dongsha), and Nansha Islands as well as providing a first line of defense along coastal areas against smugglers and illegal immigrants. The CGA is considered a civilian law enforcement agency under the administration of the Ocean Affairs Council of the Executive Yuan, though during emergencies it may be incorporated as part of the Republic of China Armed Forces.
Organization
The Coast Guard Administration is headed by one minister and three deputy ministers. The CGA includes eight departments, one office and five task forces, as well as a Maritime Patrol Directorate General and a Coastal Patrol Directorate General. Its jurisdiction covers the waters surrounding Kinmen, Matsu, Penghu, and the main island of Taiwan to ensure proper protection of the 1,819.8 kilometers coastline and 540,000 square kilometers of "Blue Territory," which is 15 times larger than the island of Taiwan.
Maritime Patrol Directorate General
The Maritime Patrol Directorate General is responsible for all maritime patrols and operations at sea.
1 - 16th Offshore Flotillas
Northern, Southern, Central, and Eastern Flotilla Sectors
Coastal Patrol Directorate General
The Coastal Patrol Directorate General is responsible for land based operations, primarily the patrolling of harbors, beaches and other coastal areas.
Northern, Southern, Central, and Eastern Coastal Patrol Offices
Special Task Unit
The Special Task Unit is an elite special forces unit of the CGA similar to the Military Police Special Services Company or the National Police Agency's Thunder Squad. During the 36th annual Han Kuang exercises they participated alongside special operations units from other branches in anti-decapitation drills.
Scope
Article two of the Coast Guard Law splits the responsibilities of the CGA into three zones, their core area (Shoreline to the end of the Exclusive Economic Zone), Waters temporarily or tentatively within the area of law enforcement, and International waters fisheries patrol.
Core area
This includes all land within 500 meters of the high tide line, Territorial waters (extending 12 nm from shoreline), the Contiguous zone (extending 24 nm from shore), and the Exclusive Economic Zone (extending 200 nm from shore).
Waters temporarily or tentatively within the area of law enforcement
These are waters within the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) were Taiwanese EEZs overlap with those of neighboring nations "where negotiations for delimitation have not yet reached a consensus."
International waters
The CGA conducts fisheries patrols in international waters, particularly the north and midwest Pacific Ocean.
History
The CGA was established on 1 February 2000, combining the Coast Guard Command (formerly under the Ministry of Defense), the Marine Police Bureau (formerly under the National Police Administration, Ministry of Interior), and several cutters from the Taiwan Directorate General of Customs, Ministry of Finance. The CGA formally unifies coastal and maritime law enforcement agencies.
It has seen a great deal of action for a young agency, participating in numerous search and rescue and anti-smuggling operations. The Coast Guard Administration was also recently involved in escorting Taiwanese fishing boats into waters disputed with Japan claimed by both sides as part of their exclusive economic zones.
In May 2019 the CGA detained two Chinese fishing vessels for illegally fishing inside Taiwan's territorial waters. One vessel was 0.4 nautical miles off Taiwanese shores while the other was 2.1 nautical miles offshore.
In May 2019 the CGA rescued six fishermen aboard a burning boat nineteen miles offshore. Five fishermen were picked up by cutter while the most seriously injured was airlifted to hospital by helicopter. All fishermen survived the ordeal although three required hospitalization.
On March 1, 2020, three coast guard cutters clearing illegal fishing nets off Little Kinmen island were attacked by Chinese fishing boats which had to be repelled with warning shots from a shotgun.
On March 16, 2020, the patrol boats CP-1022 and CP-2006 of the 9th Offshore Flotilla based on Kinmen were attacked by ten Chinese speedboats. They had been assisting a Kinmen County Government Fisheries Research Institute patrol boat in clearing fishing nets illegally left in Taiwanese waters by Chinese fishermen when they came under attack from the men in speedboats throwing rocks and bottles. During the incident CP-1022 was rammed at speed and lost the function of two of their three engines and its hull was damaged. The CGA responded to the attack using less lethal means including stun grenades and bean bag rounds which caused the attacking boats to retreat.
In July 2020 the CGA arrested all 18 crew members of a Chinese fishing vessel caught fishing illegally in Taiwanese waters. The interdiction followed an increase in illegal fishing in Taiwanese waters by Chinese fishing vessels.
Between January and July 2020 the CGA chased 2,988 Chinese sand dredging vessels out of Taiwanese waters. In July 2020 the CGA seized a dredging vessel and arrested its eight crew as a warning to the rest.
In August 2020 the CGA detained a small Chinese oil tanker which had illegally entered Taiwan's waters. The oil tanker was discovered during enhanced COVID-19 pandemic biosecurity patrols.
In May 2021 the CGA detained a Chinese offshore supply vessel and its 12 crew. The vessel was caught trespassing in Taiwanese waters near Penghu. It is believed that the supply ship was being used to deliver food and other supplies to offshore fishing fleets.
In May 2022 an Anping-class patrol ship launched a Hsiung Feng II anti-ship missile for the first time in a joint exercise with the Navy.
Intelligence Function
Some people in Taiwan still regard the Coast Guard Administration as an intelligence agency due to its root. Indeed, the land branch of the Coast Guard Administration is inherited from the former Taiwan Garrison Command. As a result, a lot of intelligence personnel from the Military Police Command or the late Taiwan Garrison Command are still in the ROCCGA.
There are several mobile investigative groups subordinated to four corresponding areas of responsibility of the Coastal Patrol Directorate General. All mobile investigative groups of the Coast Guard Administration are tasked to perform intelligence-gathering mission of State Security. While executing such intelligence-gathering function, The Coast Guard Administration is subjected to the supervisory and coordination from the National Security Bureau.
International cooperation
The CGA cooperates with Japan, the Philippines, Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesia, and Vietnam in operations to counter human trafficking and drug smuggling. The CGA and the Japan Coast Guard conduct annual exercises and visits. The CGA and the Philippines Coast Guard have conducted tabletop exercises and drills. The CGA and the US Coast Guard cooperate on monitoring longline fishing, maritime law enforcement, human trafficking, and drug smuggling.
In 2010 the CGA held their first ever drill with China's Maritime Search and Rescue Center. The drill, which simulated a ferry disaster between Kinmen and Xiamen, included 14 vessels, 3 helicopters, and 400 personal. Due to the tense relations between the two countries participating forces used drill flags instead of their national flags and emblems. The second drill in 2012 involved 18 vessels and two helicopters from Taiwan, as well as 11 ships and one helicopter from China. A third drill in 2014 featured 33 vessels, four helicopters, and 550 personnel.
In 2020 the CGA and Chinese authorities worked out a standard operating procedure for dealing with illegal sand dredging by Chinese vessels. From implementation to December 2020 Chinese authorities had taken action in 64 cases and impounded 23 ships which demonstrated to the CGA that the Chinese were serious about cooperating on the issue.
In March 2021 the CGA and the US Coast Guard announced that they had signed a cooperation agreement, the agreement was promptly denounced by China. In May 2021 US President Joe Biden praised the cooperation agreement while speaking at the commencement of the United States Coast Guard Academy. The first bilateral meeting under the agreement occurred in August 2021.
Future of the CGA
As of 2019 the CGA planned to construct a total of 141 ships, including four 4000-tonne, six 1000-tonne, 12 600-tonne, 17 100-tonne, 52 35-tonne patrol ships and 50 coastal multi-purposed ships, by 2027.
In 2021 the Taiwanese cabinet approved a NT$12.9 billion (US$428.53 million) budget for six new 3,000-ton class patrol vessels.
Fleet
In 2021 the CGA had more than 200 vessels.
In 2021 President Tsai Ing-wen ordered the name “Taiwan” to be prominently displayed on all vessels to avoid confusion with the People's Republic of China Coast Guard which is engaged in a grey-zone campaign against Taiwan and other neighboring countries.

Pierre Lemieux (born April 9, 1963) is a politician in Ontario, Canada. He served as the Member of Parliament for the riding of Glengarry-Prescott-Russell from 2006 to 2015, first elected in Canada's 39th general election and defeated in the 42nd. He represented the Conservative Party of Canada. While in office he served as deputy government whip as well as parliamentary secretary to the Ministers of Official Languages, Agriculture, and Veterans Affairs. He was a candidate for the leadership of the Conservative Party of Canada in 2017.
Background
Lemieux was born in Embrun, Ontario. He has a Bachelor of Mechanical Engineering and a Master's of Science from the Royal Military College of Canada. He has been a Professional Engineer since 1994.
Lemieux served in the Canadian Forces for 20 years and retired at the rank of Lieutenant-Colonel. He then worked for a number of years in the Ottawa high tech sector, most notably for JDS Uniphase. He then started his own company, offering project management and consulting services to government departments and charitable organizations.
Politics
Party leadership bid
In August 2016, Lemieux declared his candidacy for the 2017 Conservative Party of Canada leadership election. Lemieux's campaign manager was Steve Outhouse, a former Parliament Hill staffer.
His campaign generally focused on social conservative issues and increased personal liberties, including reducing the size and influence of government. This included a proposed review of firearms laws, term limits and Parliamentary votes for Supreme Court judges, and opposition to a carbon tax. He also favours increased government powers for face-to-face immigration screening to combat "Radical Islamic Terrorism", though opposes a controversial "Canadian values" screening test proposed by another Conservative leadership candidate, Kellie Leitch, on the grounds that "terrorists won't share their true values with [Canada's] immigration officials".
In-line with many other Conservative Party leadership contenders, Lemieux has stated that he strongly supports Israel and its right to self-defence.
Lemieux has been critical of other conservative politicians in Canada that he believes are helping make the country more liberal through their support of socially liberal legislative initiatives such as private member's Bill C-309, which seeks to establish a gender awareness week. Lemieux has stated that he believes such moves make these politicians "liberal-light" rather than conservative and has called on social conservatives to "not be taken for granted" by more liberal elements of federal and provincial conservative parties.
His policies have been supported by the anti-abortion advocacy group Campaign Life Coalition as well as University of Toronto Professor Jordan Peterson.
Social views: abortion, marriage, conscience rights
Lemieux has stated that he personally believes in the "inherent dignity of human life from the moment of conception through to natural death...we need to discuss and debate life issues in an open and respectful way, both within society and within Parliament." He has also stated that he personally believes in the traditional definition of marriage as the union between one man and one woman.
In his leadership campaign, Lemieux committed to end sex-selective abortion and divert funds that support international abortion services to Canada's military with a mind to meeting Canada's NATO commitments on defence spending. He has also been a proponent of protecting medical conscience rights particularly during considerations of physician assisted suicide.
Campaign Life Coalition, a pro-life advocacy group, rated Lemieux as a "pro-life, pro-family" Member of Parliament. During his time as a Member of Parliament he voted in favour of Stephen Woodworth's M-312, which sought to create a Parliamentary Committee that would study whether a child in the womb is a human being. He also voted against Bill C-279 (known as the "Bathroom Bill"), which would have allowed transgender individuals to use washrooms based on their gender identity. He also spoke and voted in favour of Mark Warawa's M-408, which asked that Parliament ban sex-selective abortions.
Free speech & expression
Lemieux has been a vocal critic of restrictions on freedom of speech and expression. He opposes federal legislation that proposes to add "gender expression" and "gender identify" as defining factors for discrimination in the Criminal Code and Canadian Human Rights Act on the grounds that it negatively impacts free speech. Such negative impacts were noted as including the forced use of gender neutral pronouns when addressing members of the LGBT community, for which some in that community have noted their opposition to his campaign. He has also proposed to empower Parliament to review all speech laws to ensure they properly balance freedom of speech and reasonable limits. These stances have gained the support of controversial University of Toronto Professor Jordan Peterson, whom he has met on a number of occasions.
He has also voiced strong opposition to M-103, a Parliamentary Motion of Liberal Member of Parliament Iqra Khalid, which condemns religious discrimination and makes particular note of Islamophobia in its preposition.
Electoral history
Lemieux was first elected in the 2006 Canadian federal election that brought Stephen Harper's Conservatives into Government. Lemieux narrowly defeated Liberal René Berthiaume, becoming the Conservative MP for Glengarry—Prescott—Russell. It had been one of the longest held Liberal ridings in Eastern Ontario. Lemieux improved his election results with larger margins of victory in 2008 and 2011. In 2015, Lemieux was defeated by Liberal Francis Drouin by over 10,000 votes, in an election that replaced Stephen Harper's Conservative government with Justin Trudeau's Liberals.
Lemieux ran again in the 2019 Canadian federal election but was defeated, again by Francis Drouin, though by a smaller vote margin than in 2015.
Lemieux attempted to run again in the 2021 Canadian Federal Election. However, citing policy that a candidate who loses twice is ineligible to run again, Lemieux was blocked candidacy was blocked by the Conservative party.

Love for the Arts is an American international competition series created, produced and hosted by Trinity the Tuck. The show documents Trinity's search for the best drag artist. The show is all inclusive and recruits drag contestants from all drag backgrounds. Each week, contestants are given different challenges and runways while Trinity and guest judges critique contestants' progress throughout the competition.
History
In 2019, Trinity started Love For The Arts as a traveling competition in cities all over the US to uplift all types of drag artists who did not have a platform. In 2020, Trinity decided to create a digital version for a reality competition which is loosely based on the original Love For The Arts tour. The new digital version is more advanced in structure and concept to create a more dynamic competition setting.
Format
Each episode opens with Trinity introducing herself. She then reveals the fan voting poll results for who is eliminated based on the previous episode's lip sync battle. Trinity then introduces the week's guest judge(es) and proceeds to show the episode challenge.
Challenges
Each episode features a main challenge where each of the competitors must either act, design and create a look, or do a presentation. The performances are generally judged right after. Trinity then presents the runway.
Runways
If the challenge involves the creation of an outfit, that outfit is presented to the judges in the runway. Otherwise, a theme is assigned and the contestants must put together a look that fits the theme, which is presented to the judges. The runway looks and presentation are judged along with challenge performance.
Lip Sync Battles
The contestants selected as the bottom two must lip sync to songs previously filmed by each contestant. After the lip sync battle, Trinity opens a poll online where fans vote on who should stay in the competition. The results are then shown in the following episode.
Judges
Trinity the Tuck serves as the primary judge on the show, and is the only regular judge on the panel. Each episode she is joined by a rotating cast of celebrity models, makeup artists and drag alumni including Alaska, Adore Delano, Bitqtch Puddin, Landon Cider, Trinity K. Bonet, Peppermint, Manila Luzon, Shea Coulee and Vander Von Odd.
Series overview
Season 1 (2020)
Overview
Season 1 of Love For The Arts was officially announced via Trinity the Tuck's Instagram on July 26, 2020. The show first aired on August 4, 2020 on her Twitch channel. The performers went through an audition process in which a certain group of performers then were put through to the semi-final in which the public would vote the 10 performers to enter the competition. Originally 10 performers were cast as shown in the promo but Spikey Van Dykey was announced to have quit the show at the start of Episode 1 due to personal reasons. The performers compete to win custom costumes from Jeffrey Kelly Designs & Sew-excited, a "one of a kind hairstyle" from Shontelle Sparkles, custom accessories by Kalaqtic, a new brand logo by Dan Polyak, a complete make-up package from BatMe Cosmetics, a "one of a kind" custom crown by Fierce Drag Jewels and a cash prize of $5000 provided by Twitch.
The winner of the first season of Love For The Arts was Gvajardo from Monterrey, Mexico with Carmen Monoxide and Lesley Wolf being the runners-up.

Charismatic authority is a concept of leadership developed by the German sociologist Max Weber. It involves a type of organization or a type of leadership in which authority derives from the charisma of the leader. This stands in contrast to two other types of authority: legal authority and traditional authority. Each of the three types forms part of Max Weber's tripartite classification of authority.
"Charisma" is an ancient Greek term that initially gained prominence through Saint Paul's letters to the emerging Christian communities in the first century. In this context, it generally referred to a divinely-originating "gift" that demonstrated the authority of God within the early leaders of the Church. Max Weber took this theological notion and generalized it, viewing it as something that followers attribute, thereby opening it up for use by sociologists who applied it to political, military, celebrity, and non-Christian religious contexts. Other terms used are "charismatic domination" and "charismatic leadership".
Characteristics
Charisma
Weber applies the term charisma to
This definition, however, does not get to the crux of what charisma is, making the concept as defined by Weber unscientific and impossible to measure or to manipulate. In the modern era, psychologists have defined charisma in terms of its outcomes (i.e., charismatic leaders are highly effective). Whether from a Weberian or psychological conceptualization, it is problematic to not define a construct scientifically. This issue of conceptualization is important to consider else the concept and how it relates to outcomes is circular in reasoning. The conclusions derived from the theory cannot be refuted given that the proponents claim something akin to if effective, therefore charismatic. Charisma, however, can be studied scientifically if seen as a costly signal, using values, symbols, and emotions. Its economic value in consequential settings has also been scientifically examined. Thus Weber's insights were valuable in identifying the construct of charisma. Modern social science therefore still supports the original thinking regarding the utility of the construct.
Authority
Weber interchanges authority and dominance[H]as been considered in sociological terms as indicating the legitimate or socially approved use of power. It is the legitimate power which one person or a group holds and exercises over another. The element of legitimacy is vital to the notion of authority and is the main means by which authority is distinguished from the more general concept of power. Power can be exerted by the use of force or violence. Authority, by contrast, depends on the acceptance by subordinates of the right of those above them to give them orders or directives.
Charismatic authority is often the most lasting of regimes because the leader is seen as infallible and any action against him will be seen as a crime against the state. Charismatic leaders eventually develop a cult of personality often not by their own doing.
Leadership is the power to diffuse a positive energy and a sense of greatness. As such, it rests almost entirely on the leader. The absence of that leader for any reason can lead to the authority's power dissolving. However, due to its idiosyncratic nature and lack of formal organization, charismatic authority depends much more strongly on the perceived legitimacy of the authority than Weber's other forms of authority. For instance, a charismatic leader in a religious context might require an unchallenged belief that the leader has been touched by God, in the sense of a prophet. Should the strength of this belief fade, the power of the charismatic leader can fade quickly, which is one of the ways in which this form of authority shows itself to be unstable.
In contrast to the current popular use of the term charismatic leader, Weber saw charismatic authority not so much as character traits of the charismatic leader but as a relationship between the leader and his followers. The validity of charisma is founded on its "recognition" by the leader's followers (or "adepts" – Anhänger).
His charisma risks disappearing if he is "abandoned by God" or if "his government doesn't provide any prosperity to those whom he dominates".
Routinizing charisma
Charismatic authority almost always endangers the boundaries set by traditional (coercive) or rational (legal) authority. It tends to challenge this authority, and is thus often seen as revolutionary. Usually this charismatic authority is incorporated into society. Hereby the challenge that it presents to society will subside. The way in which this happens is called routinization.
By routinization, the charismatic authority changes:
A religion which evolves its own priesthood and establishes a set of laws and rules is likely to lose its charismatic character and move towards another type of authority. For example, Muhammad, who had charismatic authority as "The Prophet" among his followers, was succeeded by the traditional authority and structure of Islam, a clear example of routinization.
In politics, charismatic rule is often found in various authoritarian states, autocracies, dictatorships and theocracies. To help to maintain their charismatic authority, such regimes will often establish a vast personality cult. When the leader of such a state dies or leaves office, and a new charismatic leader does not appear, such a regime is likely to fall shortly thereafter, unless it has become fully routinized.
Charismatic succession
Because the authority is concentrated in one leader, the death of the charismatic leader would constitute the destruction of the government unless prior arrangements were made. A society that faces the end of their charismatic leader can choose to move to another format of leadership or to have a transference of charismatic authority to another leader by means of succession.
According to Max Weber, the methods of succession are: search, revelation, designation by original leader, designation by qualified staff, hereditary charisma, and office charisma. These are the various ways in which an individual and a society can contrive to maintain the unique energy and nature of charisma in their leadership.
Search
"The search for a new charismatic leader (takes place) on the basis of the qualities which will fit him for the position of authority." An example of this search method is the search for a new Dalai Lama. "It consists in a search for a child with characteristics which are interpreted to mean that he is a reincarnation of the Buddha." This search is an example of the way in which an original charismatic leader can be forced to "live on" through a replacement.
Revelation
"In this case the legitimacy of the new leader is dependent on the legitimacy of the technique of selection." The technique of selection is the modus operandi of the selection process. In ancient times, oracles were believed to have special access to "divine judgment" and thus their technique in selection was perceived to be legitimate. Their choice was imbued with the charismatic authority that came with the oracle's endorsement.
Designation by original leader
In this form, the original holder of charismatic authority is perceived to have passed their authority to another. An example is Joseph Stalin's claim that Vladimir Lenin had designated him to be his successor as leader of the USSR. Insofar as people believed in this claim, Stalin gained Lenin's charismatic authority.
Designated by qualified staff
"A successor (may be designated) by the charismatically qualified administrative staff... (T)his process should not be interpreted as 'election' or 'nomination'... It is not determined by merely a majority vote...Unanimity (is) often required." A case example of this form of succession is the papal conclave of cardinals to choose a new pope. The cardinals taking part in the papal conclave are viewed to be charismatically qualified by their Roman Catholic congregations and thus their choice is imbued with charismatic authority.
Hereditary charisma
Charisma can be perceived as "a quality transmitted by heredity". This method of succession is present in Kim Il-sung's charisma being passed on to his son, Kim Jong Il. This type of succession is a difficult undertaking and often results in a movement toward traditionalization and legalization in authority.
Office charisma
"The concept of charisma may be transmitted by ritual means from one bearer to another...It involves a dissociation of charisma from a particular individual, making it an objective, transferable entity." Priestly consecration is believed to be a modus through which priestly charisma to teach and perform other priestly duties is transferred to a person. In this way, priests inherit priestly charisma and are subsequently perceived by their congregations as having the charismatic authority that comes with the priesthood.
Application of Weber's theories
Weber's model of charismatic leadership giving way to institutionalization is endorsed by several academic sociologists.
New religious movements
Eileen Barker discusses the tendency for new religious movements to have founders or leaders who wield considerable charismatic authority and are believed to have special powers or knowledge. Charismatic leaders are unpredictable, Barker says, for they are not bound by tradition or rules and they may be accorded by their followers the right to pronounce on all aspects of their lives. Barker warns that in these cases the leader may lack any accountability, require unquestioning obedience, and encourage a dependency upon the movement for material, spiritual and social resources.
George D. Chryssides asserts that not all new religious movements have charismatic leaders, and that there are differences in the hegemonic styles among those movements that do.
Narcissism
Len Oakes, an Australian psychologist who wrote a dissertation about charisma, had eleven charismatic leaders fill in a psychometric test, which he called the adjective checklist, and found them as a group quite ordinary. Following the psychoanalyst Heinz Kohut, Oakes argues that charismatic leaders exhibit traits of narcissism and also argues that they display an extraordinary amount of energy, accompanied by an inner clarity unhindered by the anxieties and guilt that afflict more ordinary people. He did however not fully follow Weber's framework of charismatic authority.

The Schlüsselgerät 41 ("Cipher Machine 41"), also known as the SG-41 or Hitler mill, was a rotor cipher machine, first produced in 1941 in Nazi Germany, that was designed as a potential successor for the Enigma machine. It saw limited use by the Abwehr (military intelligence) towards the end of World War II.
History
The SG-41 was created under order of the Heereswaffenamt (Inspectorate 7/VI organisation) as a collaboration between German cryptographer Fritz Menzer and Wanderer, a leading typewriter manufacturer. The machine also acquired the nickname "Hitler mill" because of the large crank attached to the side of the unit. Instead of using a lampboard like the Enigma, the SG-41 printed both the plaintext and ciphertext of the message onto two paper tapes. Due to wartime shortages of light metals such as aluminium and magnesium, the SG-41 weighed approximately , which made it unsuitable for the front lines.
Menzer intended for the SG-41 to fully replace Enigma, which he considered to no longer be secure; the Luftwaffe and Heer ordered around 11,000 units.
A total of 1,000 units were produced. Various sources have reported production figures as low as 500 units due to material shortages, but production was halted after 1,000 units, as it was considered too heavy for use on the front. In December 1943, General Fritz Thiele ordered production to cease by the end of 1944. Beginning on 12 October 1944, the first deliveries to the Abwehr began. In the final months of the war, the SG-41 was used instead of the Abwehr Enigma.
Function
Functionally, the machine had greater similarities with the Boris Hagelin C-Series. The SG-41 had six encryption rotors, compared to the Enigma, which had either three or four, in addition to a number of advanced features, making it much more resistant to cryptanalysis than the Enigma or other contemporary Hagelin machines. While the Enigma rotors advanced by one for each letter enciphered, the SG-41's wheels interacted with each other and moved irregularly, both forwards and backwards. Similar functionality was not adopted in a mass-produced cipher machine until 1952 with the advent of the Hagelin CX-52.
Cryptanalysis
The Allied codebreakers in Bletchley Park considered the device a "mystery". Only a handful of messages is able to be deciphered during the war, namely when two messages were "in depth" i.e. encrypted with the same key. The inner workings of the device were unclear until after the war, so it was not possible to perform a systematic cryptanalysis on the messages. Allied codebreakers referred to it as a "remarkable machine".
SG-41Z
In the final months of the war, an additional 550 units were built, which are referred to as the SG-41Z. This model only allowed the numbers 0–9 to be enciphered and was used by the Luftwaffe for weather reports.
Find near Aying
On 5 May 2017, two hobbyist treasure hunters found an SG-41 using a metal detector in a forest near the Bavarian city of Aying, buried approximately deep. The hobbyists donated their find to the Deutsches Museum in Munich instead of selling it privately. The museum intends to conserve it in its current condition and display it in a new permanent exhibit, BildSchriftCodes.

The TerraMar Project was self-described as an environmental nonprofit organization. It was founded in 2012 in the United States by Ghislaine Maxwell. A sister organisation in the United Kingdom was incorporated in 2013. TerraMar (U.S.) announced its closure on 12 July 2019. This was shortly after New York federal prosecutors arrested Maxwell's close associate Jeffrey Epstein. Epstein was a financier who was being charged with sex trafficking crimes for a second time. TerraMar (UK) was officially dissolved on 3 December 2019.
History
The TerraMar Project, United States
The TerraMar Project was founded on 26 September 2012 at the Blue Ocean Film Festival and Conservation Conference in Monterey, California, and focused on the 64% of the ocean that lies outside any single country's jurisdiction. Their mission was to create a "global ocean community" based around the idea of shared ownership of the global commons, also known as the high seas or international waters.
In 2014, on behalf of the TerraMar Project, Maxwell gave a lecture at the University of Texas at Dallas and later that year, a TED talk, about the importance of ocean conservation. Maxwell also spoke at the United Nations as the founder of the TerraMar Project. She accompanied Stuart Beck, a 2013 TerraMar board member, to two United Nations meetings to discuss the project. Maxwell presented at the Arctic Circle Assembly in Reykjavík, Iceland in 2013.
Scott Borgerson, listed on TerraMar's board of directors for 2013, appeared with Maxwell at the Arctic Circle conference. In June 2014, Maxwell and Borgerson spoke at an event in Washington, DC sponsored by the Council on Foreign Relations, titled “Governing the Ocean Commons: Growing Challenges, New Approaches”.
Tax documents for U.S. organization the TerraMar Project consistently list Ghislaine Maxwell as the organization's President. The TerraMar Project's address was in New York City for 990 tax filings from 2012 through 2015, with later filings showing a Woburn, Massachusetts address for 2016 and 2017. The New York Times reported that TerraMar gave out no money in grants between 2012 and 2017 and that it was described as having unusually high accounting and legal fees for an organization of its size.
Questions were also raised about what TerraMar entailed beyond the high profile appearance by Maxwell at the United Nations and on the TED stage. In 2017, an executive at a maritime firm made multiple requests for project funding to TerraMar's development director Brian Yuratsis that were ultimately denied despite Yuratsis professing interest in having TerraMar sponsor the project. The maritime executive who made the requests stated that “My impression was that TerraMar as a whole was pretty hollow”, and that “It seemed like Brian was the entire organization.”
On the organization's IRS annual return, the organization reported that it owed $560,650 to Ghislane Maxwell, it owed $1,341 of credit card debt, and it had $10,252 of cash, as of 31 December 2018. During 2018, the organization had spent $5,365 for professional fees, $9,380 for website development, $11,157 for advertising, and $270 of bank fees, but it spent nothing toward program services.
Epstein was charged with new sex trafficking crimes on 6 July 2019. Epstein was a close associate of Maxwell. The TerraMar Project announced its closure six days later, on 12 July 2019, via Twitter and a statement on its website.
TerraMar (UK)
TerraMar (UK) was a separate private limited company in the United Kingdom. It was incorporated in August 2013 in England and Wales, with the directors being Maxwell, Lucy Clive and Catherine Vaughan-Edwards. The company was run by Maxwell with a similar mission to the TerraMar Project.
The mission of the charity TerraMar (UK) was published as "the conservation, protection, and improvement of the environment" and, in particular, "the oceans, seas, coastlines and tidal areas", including "the conservation and protection of endangered marine flora and fauna, and the education of the public in the fields of marine conservation, marine ecology and related areas".
TerraMar (UK) was reported by The Times to have joined the "secretive messenger app service" on 10 August 2019, the same date on which Epstein died in prison. The application for the UK organization to be officially closed was made on 4 September 2019, with the first notice in The London Gazette made on 17 September 2019.
The company was listed as active, with a Salisbury address, until the company was listed as officially dissolved on 3 December 2019.
Founder convicted
TerraMar's founder, Ghislaine Maxwell, was arrested in July 2020 and charged with six counts related to the sexual abuse and trafficking of minors and lying to investigators. On 29 December 2021, Maxwell was convicted on five of six charges.
Organisation
The Board of Directors of the TerraMar Project (US) included former Executive Director of the United Nations Office for Partnerships (UNOP) Amir Dossal – who handles $1 billion in the form of a grant from Ted Turner for charities, media executive Steven Haft, and Ariadne Calvo-Platero, daughter of the peer Lord Beaumont of Whitley, Maxwell's best friend from Oxford.

Potassium bitartrate, also known as potassium hydrogen tartrate, with formula KC4H5O6, is a byproduct of winemaking. In cooking, it is known as cream of tartar. It is processed from the potassium acid salt of tartaric acid (a carboxylic acid). The resulting powdery base can be used in baking or as a cleaning solution (when mixed with an acidic solution such as lemon juice or white vinegar).
Occurrence
Potassium bitartrate has a low solubility in water. It crystallizes in wine casks during the fermentation of grape juice, and can precipitate out of wine in bottles. The crystals (wine diamonds) will often form on the underside of a cork in wine-filled bottles that have been stored at temperatures below , and will seldom, if ever, dissolve naturally into the wine.
These crystals also precipitate out of fresh grape juice that has been chilled or allowed to stand for some time. To prevent crystals forming in homemade grape jam or jelly, the prerequisite fresh grape juice should be chilled overnight to promote crystallization. The potassium bitartrate crystals are removed by filtering through two layers of cheesecloth. The filtered juice may then be made into jam or jelly. In some cases they adhere to the side of the chilled container, making filtering unnecessary.
The crude form (known as beeswing) is collected and purified to produce the white, odorless, acidic powder used for many culinary and other household purposes.
Applications
In food
In food, potassium bitartrate is used for:
Stabilizing egg whites, increasing their warmth, tolerance, and volume
Stabilizing whipped cream, maintaining its texture and volume
Anti-caking and thickening
Preventing sugar syrups from crystallizing by causing some of the sucrose to break down into glucose and fructose
Reducing discoloration of boiled vegetables
Additionally, it is used as a component of:
Baking powder, as an acid ingredient to activate baking soda
Sodium-free salt substitutes, in combination with potassium chloride
A similar acid salt, sodium acid pyrophosphate, can be confused with cream of tartar because of its common function as a component of baking powder.
Household use
Potassium bitartrate can be mixed with an acidic liquid such as lemon juice or white vinegar to make a paste-like cleaning agent for metals such as brass, aluminium, or copper, or with water for other cleaning applications such as removing light stains from porcelain.
This mixture is sometimes mistakenly made with vinegar and sodium bicarbonate (baking soda), which actually react to neutralize each other, creating carbon dioxide and a sodium acetate solution.
Cream of tartar was often used in traditional dyeing where the complexing action of the tartrate ions was used to adjust the solubility and hydrolysis of mordant salts such as tin chloride and alum.
Cream of tartar, when mixed into a paste with hydrogen peroxide, can be used to clean rust from some hand tools, notably hand files. The paste is applied and allowed to set for a few hours and then washed off with a baking soda/water solution. After another rinse with water and thorough drying, a thin application of oil will protect the file from further rusting.
Slowing the set time of plaster of Paris products (most widely used in gypsum plaster wall work and artwork casting) is typically achieved by the simple introduction of almost any acid diluted into the mixing water. A commercial retardant premix additive sold by USG to trade interior plasterers includes at least 40% potassium bitartrate. The remaining ingredients are the same plaster of Paris and quartz-silica aggregate already prominent in the main product. This means that the only active ingredient is the cream of tartar.
Cosmetics
For dyeing hair, potassium bitartrate can be mixed with henna as the mild acid needed to activate the henna.
Medicinal use
Cream of tartar has been used internally as a purgative, but this is dangerous because an excess of potassium, or hyperkalemia, may occur.
Chemistry
Potassium bitartrate is the United States' National Institute of Standards and Technology's primary reference standard for a pH buffer. Using an excess of the salt in water, a saturated solution is created with a pH of 3.557 at . Upon dissolution in water, potassium bitartrate will dissociate into acid tartrate, tartrate, and potassium ions. Thus, a saturated solution creates a buffer with standard pH. Before use as a standard, it is recommended that the solution be filtered or decanted between and .
Potassium carbonate can be made by burning cream of tartar, which produces "pearl ash". This process is now obsolete but produced a higher quality (reasonable purity) than "potash" extracted from wood or other plant ashes.

Never Give Up is a 2D platform game developed by Massive Monster and Tasselfoot and published by Armor Games on August 13, 2019. The game follows a stick figure man named Blue who awakes in a strange facility and tries to escape it. The main gameplay consists of several level "sets", each of which contain several increasingly difficult iterations on the same level. The game is a reboot of the Give Up series, also published by Armor Games, and includes full voice acting by Arin Hanson of Game Grumps.
Gameplay
Never Give Up is divided into different worlds each containing different levels leading up to a boss battle. The levels consist of several versions of the same basic room layout, increasing in difficult as the player progresses through them by adding additional hazards and lengthening the level. After dying enough times within a level, players can skip past it by selecting a "give up" option.
Reception
Never Give Up was received generally well by critics. It was praised for its difficulty and the satisfaction of overcoming its challenges, although critics noted its lack of originality and its tendency to be outdated.

Michtim: Fluffy Adventures is a pen & paper storytelling game that was created by Georg Mir in 2012 and published by GrimOgre Laboratory. The game has a strong focus on streamlined game design, ethics and inclusiveness in its game setting.
In Michtim: Fluffy Adventures, the players portray eponymous creatures called Michtim that are most easily described as anthropomorphized hamsters with some features of cats, rabbits or rodents. These characters have a thriving society that places an emphasis on equality and diversity in many aspects. Fur colors, different (often fluid) gender identities, pansexuality and polyamory (nests as families) all are explored, as well as showing that different body types are welcome and accepted.
Game mechanics and play
The game uses a couple of six-sided dice, which are rolled and added together. If the sum exceeds 7 the roll was a basic success. To increase the effect, players have to set aside dice before rolling, making success less likely but worth more. This way, players can decide for themselves whether they want to play with risk or stay on the safe side.
The game also uses a unique system in place of the common attributes of roleplaying games. Instead it focuses on emotions. Emotions range from Anger, Joy, Grief, Fear to Joy. Each emotion is associated with in-game actions. The attributes therefore define the character's role as possible healer, scout or damage dealer. Michtim: Fluffy Adventures also uses the concept of mood markers. These simulate that the hero is getting in a mood which affects their actions significantly. There are game mechanics in place to affect the moods of others, so the story always takes an emotional approach, which is very different from other games.
Creature definition and behavior
Callings are the classes of Michtim. They are often reduced to a single mechanic that can be combined by activating multiple Callings. This is much like multi-classing in other games, but built from the ground up to encourage players to find new synergies with existing material. Another important aspect of this system is that all attributes are useful to every Calling, whereas in other games only some attributes are relevant to a single class. There can be angry sorcerers (as damage dealers), caring sorcerers (as healers) or afraid of sorcerers (as scouts). Even if one Calling is used by two members of the group their personalities (emotion attributes) will change how they use them.
The game puts an emphasis on non-violent solutions. The game's three factions all value a different virtue.
Haus Barsik strives for Conservancy of nature, protecting the wilds.
Haus Grauling values Culture as exemplified by progress, industriousness, ingenuity.
Haus Turnaya favors Charity like caring for others and nonviolence.
Factions can have conflicts based on their values (like placing an emphasis on progress, but exploiting nature) and are encouraged to sort things out diplomatically. Players will often come into conflict with humanity's interference. Michtims live secluded from modern humanity, but often have to defend their woods covertly, sometimes by sabotaging human projects.
Game world and narrative
The game is a modern fantasy game. Technology exists in Michtim culture, up to the point of having drones and augmented Michtim heroes called Cybertooth. Magic exists as well, humans are just not used to seeing it. Michtims are protected by the magic power of the Veil which ensures that they remain somewhat hidden from human eyes. Humans only see them as mere hamsters.
Mir refers to Michtim's overall narrative genre as hamsterpunk (thus creating a whimsical new derivative of cyberpunk).
Development history
The first installment of the game was created by Mir as the practical part of his master thesis at FH Joanneum (University of Applied Sciences), supported by his thesis advisor Johannes Grenzfurthner.
Awards and nominations
In October 2015, Michtim: Fluffy Adventures was nominated for a World Experience Award and ranked in close second place, at World Usability Congress 2015 in Graz.
Critical reception
Wyatt Salazar of Critical Hits says "Michtim: Fluffy Adventures will delight any gamer who is a fan of simple, narrative-focused games, who wants something quick and different to play, or for fans of cute, cuddly animals." Dominic Claveau writes: "In a nutshell, what I discovered with Michtim is that beyond all the cuteness, there was a game that had a great level of complexity without being hard to learn and manipulate. It's also a game that empowers the users and gives them all they need to make this little universe into something special and unique for each gaming group." Samuel Van Der Wall of RPG Alchemy writes: "The two things that strike me as remarkable about the game are its uniqueness and the fact that it was essentially created by one person. The quality of the product is extremely high for a solo venture and the creator came up with an incredibly unique setting that contains unique, but relatively simple, game mechanics." Nenad Ristic summarizes that "the game feels a bit like a European Saturday Morning cartoon, complete with an emphasis on conservation". Mark Knights says that Michtim "promotes a message of equality between beings" and calls it "a beautiful family game".

The 3rd Guard Division () was created in February 1949 under the Regulation of the Redesignations of All Organizations and Units of the Army, issued by Central Military Commission on November 1, 1948, basing on the 16th Division, 6th Column of the PLA Huadong Field Army. Its history can be traced to the 2nd Detachment of New Fourth Army, formed in February 1940.
History
The division, then as in today, is part of the 24th Corps. Under the flag of 70th division it took part in several major battles in the Chinese Civil War.
By then the division was composed of:
208th Regiment;
209th Regiment;
210th Regiment;
350th Artillery Regiment;
In September 1952, the division entered Korea as a part of the People's Volunteer Army. During its deployment to Korea the division took part in the Battle of Triangle Hill and the Battle of Kumsong, allegedly inflicting 9600 casualties on UN Forces.
In October 1955 the division pulled out from Korea and redeployed in the then Beijing Military Region.
In April 1960 the division was re-organized into a Motorized Army Division. In April Antiaircraft Artillery Regiment was activated from the former 209th Regiment. On May 11, 1960 275th Tank Self-Propelled Artillery Regiment was activated and attached to the division. In January 1961 the 209th Motorized Infantry Regiment was re-activated. By then the division was composed of:
Division HQ
208th Motorized Infantry Regiment;
209th Motorized Infantry Regiment(newly activated);
210th Motorized Infantry Regiment;
275th Tank Self-Propelled Artillery Regiment(newly activated);
350th Artillery Regiment;
Antiaircraft Artillery Regiment(former 209th Regiment)
In late October 1962 the division was further organized into a Mechanized Army Division, becoming the second mechanized division of PLA ground force (the first one was 1st Mechanized Division). A tank battalion is activated in each now mechanized infantry regiments.
As of late 1962, the division was composed of:
Division HQ
208th Mechanized Infantry Regiment;
209th Mechanized Infantry Regiment;
210th Mechanized Infantry Regiment;
275th Tank Self-Propelled Artillery Regiment;
350th Artillery Regiment;
Antiaircraft Artillery Regiment
On June 15, 1966, the division was removed from the 24th Army Corps and was transferred to the Beijing Garrison and renamed as the 3rd Guard Division(). The 208th, 209th, and 210th Mechanized Infantry Regiments were renamed as the 7th, 8th, and 9th Guard Regiments, respectively. In August 1969 the 275th Tank Self-Propelled Artillery Regiment was renamed as the Tank Regiment, 3rd Guard Division, and the 350th Artillery Regiment was renamed as the Artillery Regiment, 3rd Guard Division.
Throughout the 1960s and 1970s, the division was the only mechanized formation following 190th Army Division's re-motorization, and the only unit possessing tank battalions for its infantry regiments.
Since December 31, 1974, the division became a "showcase" unit.
In January 1979, the 7th, 8th, and 9th Guard Regiments were renamed as the 11th, 12th, and 13th Guard Regiments, respectively.
The division participated in the crackdown on the civil unrest and protests in Beijing in 1989.
In 1992, tank battalions of the guard regiments were disbanded.
In 1998 the 12th Guards Regiment was disbanded. The Tank Regiment was renamed as the Armored Regiment, 3rd Guard Division.
Current organization
Today, as one of only 2 active divisions of the PLA Ground Forces within Beijing and one of the few remaining divisions in service, it is organized into:
Division HQ
11th Guards Regiment (showcase unit)
13th Guards Regiment (special security unit)
Armored Regiment
Artillery Regiment
Anti-Aircraft Artillery Regiment
Support Battalion
The division is permanently garrisoned in Beijing and thus helps provide for its defense and security as the capital of the republic.

Fort Bidwell is a census-designated place in Modoc County, California. It is located northeast of Alturas, at an elevation of 4564 feet (1391 m). Its population is 180 as of the 2020 census, up from 173 from the 2010 census.
Geography
Fort Bidwell is located near the north end of the Surprise Valley. The community's ZIP Code is 96112 and elevation is about . The coordinates for the town are . The airport, (FAA identifier: A28), is about north of the center of the community at . The Fort Bidwell Indian Community is affiliated with the Paiute nation.
According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP covers an area of 3.2 square miles (8.3 km), 99.48% of it land, and 0.52% of it water.
Climate
This region experiences warm (but not hot) and dry summers, with no average monthly temperatures above 71.6 °F. According to the Köppen Climate Classification system, Fort Bidwell has a warm-summer Mediterranean climate, abbreviated "Csb" on climate maps.
Communications
Wired telephone numbers in the community follow the format (530) 279-2xxx or 279-6xxx and appear to be served out of the Cedarville central office. Wired telephone service is provided by Citizens Utilities.
History
In 1865, General John Bidwell backed a petition from settlers at Red Bluff, California to protect Red Bluff's trail to the Owhyhee Mines of Idaho. The U.S. Army commissioned seven forts for this purpose, and dispatched a Major Williamson in April to explore a site for a fort in either Goose Lake Valley or Surprise Valley, from which he selected a site near Fandango Pass at the base of the Warner Mountains in the north end of Surprise Valley, and orders to build the fort were issued on June 10, 1865. Although Surprise Valley settlers desired Army protection, ranchers dispossessed of lands for the fort complained, and claimed damages from the Army.
The fort was built in 1865 amid escalating fighting with the Snake Indians of eastern Oregon and southern Idaho. It was a base for operations in the Snake War that lasted until 1868, the Battle of Infernal Caverns in 1867 with General George Crook, the Modoc War of 1872–73 and the Bannock and Nez Perce campaigns. Although traffic dwindled on the Red Bluff route once the Central Pacific Railroad extended into Nevada in 1868, the Army staffed Fort Bidwell to quell various uprisings and disturbances until 1890.
Both Fort Bidwell and Camp Bidwell, near Chico were named for General John Bidwell. However, Camp Bidwell was commissioned in 1863, renamed Camp Chico by the time Fort Bidwell was commissioned in 1865, and was decommissioned in 1893. Observing confusion between the two, Robert W. Pease explained that such a transfer of name between outposts was a common Army practice of the time.
The Fort Bidwell post office opened in 1868. A 1913 book described Fort Bidwell as having a population of about 200, and containing a school and reservation for the Northern Paiute Kidütökadö band (Gidu Ticutta - ‘Yellow-bellied marmot-Eaters', also called "Northern California Paiute").
Fort Bidwell is now registered as California Historical Landmark #430.

St. Joseph's Cathedral is a Roman Catholic cathedral in Gulu, Gulu District, Uganda. It is the seat of Archbishop John Baptist Odama, head of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Gulu.
History
Construction of the 5 000-seat cathedral, organized by the Comboni Missionary Brothers, was a massive effort. Brother Attilio Consolaro supervised the work from the beginning to the end, and in honor of this achievement, a street in Rome was named after him.
The work was started in the year 1931 and completed in 1941. The Brotherhood made and baked 800 000 bricks at the Oyitino River, from where Christians and Catechumens every Sunday after the Mass carried bricks on their heads to the site of building. The cathedral was consecrated on 13 June 1947, the Feast of the Most Sacred Heart of Jesus.
On 24 December 1938, while the work was still in progress, the first two priests from the Northern Region were ordained: Rev. Frs John Oῃom and Donasyano Bala.
The remains of Bishops Angelo Negri and Cipriano Kihangire were laid to rest in this cathedral. In 1994 the original roof with iron sheets was replaced by a roof of copper.
On 6 February 1993, Pope John Paul II entered the cathedral to adore the Holy Eucharist as thousands of people turned up to see him.
In 2000, the original floor was replaced by a new one. The interior and the exterior were redecorated in 2000 and 2001. From its establishment, it was run by the Comboni Missionaries up to 2006. The first diocesan priest to be a pastor of this cathedral was Fr. Gaudensio Langol Olango from 2007 to 2008, when he died in a road accident along Gulu–Kampala Highway.

Anne Sullivan Macy (born as Johanna Mansfield Sullivan; April 14, 1866 – October 20, 1936) was an American teacher best known for being the instructor and lifelong companion of Helen Keller.
At the age of five, Sullivan contracted trachoma, an eye disease, which left her partially blind and without reading or writing skills. She received her education as a student of the Perkins School for the Blind; soon after graduation at age 20, she became a teacher to Keller.
Childhood
Sullivan was born on April 14, 1866, in Feeding Hills, Agawam, Massachusetts. The name on her certificate of baptism was Johanna Mansfield Sullivan but she was called Anne or Annie from birth. She was the oldest child of Thomas and Alice (Cloesy) Sullivan, who emigrated from Ireland to the United States during the Great Famine.
When she was five years old Sullivan contracted the bacterial eye disease trachoma, which caused many painful infections and over time made her nearly blind. When she was eight her mother died from tuberculosis and her father abandoned the children two years later for fear he could not raise them on his own. She and her younger brother, James (Jimmie), were sent to the run-down and overcrowded almshouse in Tewksbury, Massachusetts, today part of Tewksbury Hospital, and their younger sister, Mary, was left to an aunt. Jimmie had a weak hip condition and then died from tuberculosis four months into their stay. Anne remained at Tewksbury after his death and endured two unsuccessful eye operations.
As a result of reports of cruelty to inmates at Tewksbury, including sexually perverted practices and cannibalism, the Massachusetts Board of State Charities launched an investigation into the institution in 1875. The investigation was led by Franklin Benjamin Sanborn, then chairman of the board, and Samuel Gridley Howe, founder of the Perkins School for the Blind in Boston.
In February 1877 Anne was sent to the Soeurs de la Charité hospital in Lowell, Massachusetts, where she had another unsuccessful operation. While there she helped the nuns in the wards and went on errands in the community until July of that year, when she was sent to the city infirmary, where she had one more unsuccessful operation, and was then transferred back to Tewksbury under duress.
Instead of returning to the facility for predominantly ill and insane patients, she was housed with single mothers and unmarried pregnant women.
During a subsequent inspection of Tewksbury in 1880 by Franklin Benjamin Sanborn, now State Inspector of Charities, Anne beseeched him to allow her to be admitted to the Perkins School for the Blind. Within months her plea was granted.
Education
Anne began her studies at the Perkins School on October 7, 1880. Although her first years at Perkins were humiliating because of her rough manners, she managed to connect with a few teachers and made progress with her learning. While there she befriended Laura Bridgman, a graduate of Perkins and the first blind and deaf person to be educated there; Anne learned the manual alphabet from Laura. During her time there she had a series of eye operations that significantly improved her vision. In June 1886 she graduated at age 20 as the valedictorian of her class. She stated:
Career
The summer following Sullivan's graduation, the director of Perkins, Michael Anagnos, was contacted by Arthur Keller, who was in search of a teacher for his seven-year-old blind and deaf daughter, Helen. Anagnos immediately recommended Sullivan for this position and she began her work on March 3, 1887, at the Kellers' home in Tuscumbia, Alabama. As soon as she arrived she argued with Helen's parents about the Civil War and over the fact that they had owned slaves. However she also quickly connected with Helen. It was the beginning of a 49-year relationship: Sullivan evolved from teacher to governess and finally to companion and friend.
Sullivan's curriculum involved a strict schedule, with constant introduction of new vocabulary; however she quickly changed her teaching method after seeing it did not suit Keller. Instead she began to teach her vocabulary based on her own interests, by spelling each word out into Keller's palm; within six months this method proved to be working, since Keller had learned 575 words, some multiplication tables and the Braille system.
Sullivan strongly encouraged Helen's parents to send her to the Perkins School, where she could have an appropriate education. Once they had agreed Sullivan took Keller to Boston in 1888 and stayed with her there. Sullivan continued to teach her bright protégée, who soon became famous for her remarkable progress. With the help of the school's director, Anagnos, Keller became a public symbol for the school, helping to increase its funding and donations and making it the most famous and sought-after school for the blind in the country. However an accusation of plagiarism against Keller greatly upset Sullivan: she left and never returned but did remain influential to the school. Sullivan also remained a close companion to Keller and continued to assist in her education, which ultimately included a degree from Radcliffe College.
Personal life
On May 3, 1905, Sullivan married Harvard University instructor and literary critic John Albert Macy (1877–1932), who had helped Keller with her publications. When she married, Sullivan was already living with Keller as her personal teacher, so Macy moved into the household of both women. However, within a few years, the marriage began to disintegrate. By 1914, they separated, though he is listed as living as a "lodger" with them in the 1920 U.S. Census. As the years progressed after their separation, Macy appears to have faded from her life, and the two never officially divorced. Macy died in 1932 of a heart attack. Sullivan never remarried.
Awards
In 1932, Keller and Sullivan were each awarded honorary fellowships from the Educational Institute of Scotland. They were also awarded honorary degrees from Temple University. In 1955, Keller was awarded an honorary degree from Harvard University, and in 1956, the director's cottage at the Perkins School was named the Keller-Macy Cottage.
In 2003, Sullivan was inducted into the National Women's Hall of Fame.
Death
Sullivan had been seriously visually impaired for almost all of her life, but by 1901, after having a stroke at age 35, she became completely blind. On October 15, 1936, she had a coronary thrombosis, fell into a coma, and died five days later at the age of 70 in the Forest Hills neighborhood of Queens, New York, with Keller holding her hand. Keller described Sullivan as being very agitated during her last month of life, but during the last week, she was said to return to her normal generous self. Sullivan was cremated and her ashes interred in a memorial at the National Cathedral in Washington, D.C. She was the first woman to be recognized for her achievements in this way. When Keller died in 1968, she was cremated as well and her ashes were interred alongside those of Sullivan.
Media representation
Sullivan is the main character in The Miracle Worker by William Gibson, originally produced for television in 1957, in which she was portrayed by Teresa Wright. The Miracle Worker then moved to Broadway and later was produced as a 1962 feature film. Both the play and the film featured Anne Bancroft as Sullivan. Patty Duke, who played Keller on Broadway and in the 1962 film, later played Sullivan in a 1979 television remake. Blythe Danner portrayed her in The Miracle Continues and Roma Downey portrayed her in the TV movie Monday After the Miracle (1998). Alison Elliott portrayed her in a 2000 television movie. Alison Pill played her on Broadway in the short-lived 2010 revival, with Abigail Breslin as Keller.

Lake Wingra is a small lake located inside the city limits of the U.S. city of Madison, Wisconsin. The smallest of the five major lakes drained by the Yahara River in Dane County, Lake Wingra is bordered by the University of Wisconsin–Madison Arboretum on the south and west and the City of Madison on the remaining shoreline. The lake is considered an important fishery and is known for spring runs of large muskellunge. Henry Vilas Zoo, Wingra Boats, Wingra Park, and Edgewood College are located on the Lake's northern shoreline. The majority of the shoreline is publicly owned.
History
Historically, Native Americans made extensive use of the lands surrounding Lake Wingra, which takes its name from the word for "duck" in the language of the Ho-Chunk Nation.
In the past, Lake Wingra was a very productive lake ecosystem with significant groundwater inputs. These inputs primarily took the form of surface springs and subsurface seepage, with drainage running through Wingra Creek to Lake Monona and the Yahara River, which is part of the Upper Rock River drainage, a tributary to the Mississippi River.
Over the past two hundred years, human use of the lake and its watershed have changed significantly. Only a fraction of the historical springs feeding the lake still remain and a much greater percentage of the lake's water budget comprises chemically, biologically and thermally polluted surface runoff. Lake Wingra, like other lakes in the Yahara chain (Mendota, Monona, Waubesa and Kegonsa), is severely stressed by a combination of toxic pollutants, such as mercury and PCBs, thermal pollution, sedimentation, exotic species (plant, animal and microbial), intense human recreational use and hyper-nutrification with nitrogen and phosphorus.
Stormwater management in the Lake Wingra basin was essentially ignored during the period of the greatest development in the watershed. Storm drains ran directly to Lake Wingra and combined sewer issues resulted in discharges of zoo wastes into the Lake and Wingra Creek. This problem has been addressed successfully by the City of Madison. In other locations, stormwater is directed to holding and settling ponds which slow flows and trap pollutants before they move downstream to the lake itself. These ponds are contaminated with a variety of biological and chemical pollutants including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), heavy metals (e.g. Hg, Cd, Zn, Ni), and organic chemicals (phthalates, etc.). Restoration activities on the UW Arboretum will include removal of contaminated sediments from holding ponds which have not already been upgraded.
Efforts to restore Lake Wingra are taking place but so far, these have been small, mostly demonstration projects rather than a comprehensive basin-wide approach. The Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources is experimenting with removal of non-native carp in Lake Wingra during 2006/2007.
The USGS has a 2007 project (Project Number BQY31) located on the Edgewood College campus near the shore of Lake Wingra that tests the effectiveness of two rain gardens in containing water, with hopes this will lead to improved rain garden efficiency.

Glass Tea House - KOU-AN is a chashitsu (teahouse) created by Japanese designer and artist Tokujin Yoshioka.
The teahouse made its debut at the 54th La Biennale di Venezia in 2011. Starting with the exhibition at Tendai Sect Shōren-in, Kyoto in 2015, the teahouse is traveling inside Japan, and it is currently exhibited at the National Art Center, Tokyo.
Description
Glass Tea House - KOU-AN revisits the very roots of Japanese culture through, and transcending time and space. This glass made teahouse does not feature traditional scrolls or Ikebana, Japanese flower arrangement, the usual embellishments associated with a teahouse. Instead, by using glass, the resulting architecture delights and confounds the eye, creating a glistening water surface under the shower of natural light, with light refracted by a crystal prism sculpture turning into a rainbow of ‘flowers made of light'. In the absence of physical components, this ‘architecture of light' reaches poetic and thought-provoking dimensions.
Unlike the traditional Japanese teahouse which is often described as a closed microcosm, Glass Tea House - KOU-AN is composed of glass, and therefore shows different expressions with the influence of surrounding environment.
Exhibitions
'Glass Tea House - KOU-AN' 2011, 54th La Biennale di Venezia Glasstress 2011 (Venice, Italy)
The design of Glass Tea House - KOU-AN was presented at the Glasstress 2011, the collateral event of the 54th La Biennale di Venezia which is held in Venice every two years.
'Glass Tea House - KOU-AN' 2015 – 2017, the Shogunzuka Seiryu-den stage, Tendai Sect Shoren-in (Kyoto, Japan)
Shogunzuka is located on the peak of Mt. Higashiyama. Panoramic view of Kyoto could be observed from its deck where Glass Tea House - KOU-AN was exhibited. In 794 when Emperor Kanmu was looking for a location to establish a new capital, he climbed to the area now known as Shogunzuka and decided to move the capital to Kyoto, and constructed Heian Kyo, a city where Japanese culture and art bloomed. Painting of the Blue Cetaka, a national treasure of Japan, is also dedicated to Shoren-in.
'TOKUJIN YOSHIOKA Glass Tea House - KOU-AN' 2018 – 2019, The Saga Prefectural Art Museum (Saga, Japan)
The installation of teahouse was showcased inside a white exhibition space along with some of Yoshioka's renowned artworks such as Water Block, glass bench permanently displayed at Musée d' Orsay, and Waterfall, glass table. Saga is Yoshioka's home town, and in 2015 his exhibition TOKUJIN YOSHIOKA_TORNADO was held in celebration of the museum's renewal.
'TOKUJIN YOSHIOKA Glass Tea House - KOU-AN' 2019 – 2022, The National Art Center, Tokyo (Tokyo, Japan)
The National Art Center, Tokyo which opened in 2007, is known for the beautiful wavelike glass wall façade designed by Kisho Kurokawa. Glass Tea House - KOU-AN is exhibited at the main entrance of the art center along with Water Block, glass bench permanently displayed at Musée d' Orsay.

Christopher Alan Saunders (born 15 January 1950) is an Australian prelate of the Catholic Church who served as the bishop of Broome from 1996 to 2021, when he resigned amid allegations of sexual misconduct.However he was not charged with any police charges due to lack of evidence.
Biography
Christopher Saunders was born on 15 January 1950. He studied at St. Bede's College in Mentone, Victoria, and then studied philosophy for three years with the Columbians. Having developed an interest in aboriginal affairs, he was accepted by the Diocese of Broome and continued his studies in theology at St Francis Xavier Seminary in Adelaide. He worked as a deacon in Broome in 1975 and was ordained a priest of that diocese on 28 August 1976. His assignments took him to La Grange Mission (1976–1978), Lombadina Mission (1978–1982), and Kalumburu Mission (1982–1988). From 1989 to 1995 he was administrator of Broome, interrupted by two years of study for a licentiate in canon law at St. Paul's Pontifical University in Ottawa, Canada.
Saunders was named bishop of the Broome, Australia, on 3 November 1995, and consecrated a bishop on 8 February 1996.
On 9 March 2020, Saunders voluntarily stood aside from the administration of the diocese after the Vatican ordered a review of the diocese. Church authorities did not indicate any connection between that investigation and the news that Western Australian Police had been investigating an allegation made of sexual misconduct made against him 18 months earlier. Peter Ingham, Bishop emeritus of Wollongong, has been tasked with the Church's investigation into Saunder's management, including financial affairs and handling allegations of sexual misconduct by priests. The Church had received complaints about Saunders as early as April 2019 and tried to evaluate them while preventing their repetition and without alerting Saunders. On 27 November 2020, Saunders agreed to take a six-months leave "outside the Diocese", where his continued performance in public as a priest has provoked complaints.
In May 2021, government officials decided not to file criminal charges. Pope Francis accepted his resignation as Bishop of Broome on 28 August 2021.

The was a Japanese light bomber of World War II. It was a single-engine, mid-wing, cantilever monoplane of stressed-skin construction with a fixed tailwheel undercarriage and a long transparent cockpit canopy. The type had significance in being the first Japanese aircraft to be powered by a modern two-row radial engine. During the war, it was known by the Allies by the name Ann.
Design and development
The Ki-30 was developed in response to a May 1936 Imperial Japanese Army specification to replace the Kawasaki Ki-3 light bomber with a completely indigenously designed and built aircraft. Mitsubishi and Kawasaki were requested to build two prototypes each by December 1936. The specification called for a top speed of at 3,000 m (9,840 ft); normal operating altitude from 2,000 m (6,560 ft) to 4,000 m (13,130 ft), the ability to climb to 3,000 m (9,840 ft) within eight minutes and an engine to be selected from the Mitsubishi Ha-6 radial, Nakajima Ha-5 radial, or Kawasaki Ha-9-IIb liquid-cooled inline engines, a normal bomb load of and a maximum of , one forward-firing machine gun and one flexible rearward-firing machine gun, the ability to perform 60° dives for dive bombing, and a loaded weight less than .
The first Mitsubishi prototype flew on 28 February 1937 powered by a Mitsubishi Ha-6 radial. Originally, designed with a retractable main landing gear, wind tunnel tests indicated that the gain in speed was minimal due to the landing gear's extra weight and complexity and a fixed arrangement with "spatted" main wheels was chosen instead. The wing was mounted at a point above the line of the aircraft's belly in order to fully enclose the bomb bay within the fuselage. The pilot sat just above the leading edge of the wing, and the rear-gunner/radio-operator just behind the wing trailing edge, in a long "greenhouse" canopy which gave both crewmen excellent all-around vision. The Ha-6 engine drove a three-blade variable-pitch propeller.
A second prototype, fitted with the slightly more powerful Nakajima Ha-5 engine, was completed the same month. Although two months behind schedule and overweight, both prototypes met or exceeded every other requirement. The second prototype's top speed of at 4,000 m (13,130 ft) led the Imperial Japanese Army Air Force to place an order for 16 service trials machines. These were delivered in January 1938 and the result of the trials was that the Army ordered the Ki-30 into production in March under the designation Army Type 97 Light bomber.
Mitsubishi built 618 production machines through April 1940, and the 1st Army Air Arsenal (Tachikawa Dai-Ichi Rikugun Kokusho) built 68 more by the time production ceased in September 1941. Including prototypes, a total of 704 Ki-30s were built.
Operational history
The Ki-30s were first used in combat in Second Sino-Japanese War from spring 1938. It proved to be reliable in rough field operations, and highly effective while operating with fighter escort. This success continued in the early stages of the Pacific War, and the Ki-30s participated extensively in operations in the Philippines. However, once unescorted Ki-30s met Allied fighters, losses mounted rapidly and the type was soon withdrawn to second-line duties. By the end of 1942, most Ki-30s were relegated to a training role. Many aircraft were expended in kamikaze attacks towards the end of the war.
From late 1940, the Ki-30 was in service with the Royal Thai Air Force, and saw combat in January 1941 against the French in French Indochina in the French-Thai War. 24 aircraft were delivered, and were nicknamed Nagoya by the crews. Additional Ki-30s were transferred from Japan in 1942.

The Sudanese Red Crescent (SRC) is the biggest and most decentralized and widespread humanitarian organization operating in Sudan. The society developed out of the Sudan branch of the British Red Cross Society and was established in 1956. Upon Sudan's independence in March 1956 received official recognition as an independent National Society following the Sudanese Council of Ministers decree No. 869. The National Society covers nearly the entire country with 15 State branches and several sub-branches/units in the provinces/localities and administrative units, with a nationwide community-based network of 35,000 active volunteers and another 300,000 who can be deployed as need arises. It has well-established working relations with public authorities at federal, state and local levels, and good partnership and collaboration with Movement partners and UN specialized agencies and national and international NGOs working in Sudan.
The SRCS law has been proclaimed by the authority in June 2010, giving the National Society a strong legal base and clear mandate to run First Aid, emergency response, health interventions and other humanitarian operations. The Society is well known by the public for its humanitarian work and community service through many years of emergency relief and community-based programming, and through close collaboration with national and international organizations as well as relevant government departments.
Over the past four years, the National Society has taken significant steps to address fundamental structural and organizational change. A process of decentralization and the establishment of autonomous state branches, as well as the development of an active and participatory community-based volunteer network has been initiated to make the National Society more accessible, responsible and accountable.
Following the independence of South Sudan, the South Sudan Red Cross split from the Sudanese Red Crescent in 2011.
Mission
Improve the quality of life of vulnerable groups by promotion and strengthening capacities of local communities.
Strategic Core Areas
The core areas could be summarized in the following:
Disaster preparedness and disaster response
Basic health care services, community health programs (commercial First Aid)
Promotion and integration of the Movement's Principles & humanitarian values,
Organizational development ( a strong constituent NS with capable branches in coordination and collaboration with all partners. Coping with the changing situation & considering crosscutting issues e.g. gender / volunteers issues, community participation.
With the support of the ICRC and other Movement Partners, in 2010–2011, the SRCS successfully managed the largest humanitarian operations it ever had in relation to the National Election and Referendum of South Sudan. The NS mobilized over 20,000 trained and equipped volunteers and 75 ambulances.
In the context of the recent conflict that has broken in three Protocol Areas, in several places which has created new displacement. Access has been severely limited for many humanitarian actors, yet the SRCS has intervened through the emergency action teams and remained one of the few humanitarian agencies with thousands of trained volunteers providing relief assistance without discrimination to all affected people, with in-kind support from both RC/RC movement and External partners.
Projects
Sudanese Red Crescent (SRC) implements various humanitarian programmes and projects that include but not limited to:
Health
SRC is prioritizing various health services, community health programs (health education, sanitation, awareness campaigns and community based activities (first-aid and HIV/AIDS) as well as response activities to the emerging diseases and epidemics. Drinking water and sanitation projects are also being carried out by SRCS in order to provide safe, adequate drinking water and sanitation facilities as well as taking relevant topics in health education. SRCS is using training manuals for Community Based First Aid (CBFA), Primary Health Care (PHC) and Home Nursing. Trainers are the backbone of the process. SRCS has motivated and dedicated trainers in the branches as well as the HQ, and continue to organize training of trainers workshops to maintain the required number of trainers.
First aid
Community Based Health First Aid (CBHFA) is one of the core competencies of the SRCS. Poor health services coverage (40 – 60 percent) of the population and primary health care with coverage of 10 to 30 percent demonstrates the needs in the rural level with community health care. The purpose of CBHFA in the community is to empower the communities to improve their health situation and encourage healthier and safer lifestyles through behaviour change. The volunteer trained in CBHFA is part of the community. CBHFA activities are based upon a core of knowledge and skills as well as some optional ones according to the specific health profile of the community.
Epidemic preparedness
Irregular outbreaks and high prevalence of communicable diseases such as malaria, meningitis, water related diseases, low coverage of vaccine preventable diseases demonstrate the role health promotion prevention and disease surveillance can play in the communities in Sudan. The community health volunteers receive training on prevention and control of prevailing infectious and endemic diseases in their own community. Volunteers organize their communities to identify the health problems and find possible solutions to their problems. They l coordinate with the authorities and work with the community leaders to obtain their support.
Mine risk reduction
SRC and its partners work towards mine-risk reduction through various activities that include ; mine detection, mine clearance, destroying or disposing of landmines, and providing mine-risk education.
Tracing
Since its establishment, SRCS has been mandated to assist victims in time of war, and the 1949 Geneva Conventions are the main legal basis for this mandate. Tracing is carried out to locate family members who may have been separated, lost contact, taken as prisoners or gone missing as a result of wars, natural disasters, political upheavals or social problems. After being located this program enables them to reestablish contact, and if possible reunited, with their family members and relatives.
Disaster management
SRC focuses on community-based disaster preparedness, which based on the belief that the first people to respond to a disaster are those living the area. This community should be able to start rescue and relief operations on their own. Projects developed by SRCS assist communities to reduce their vulnerability to disasters and also strengthen their capability.
Aids program
The Sudanese Red Crescent is an active member of the Sudan National AIDS Control Programme (SNAP) and the Country Theme Group (CTG) as well as the Sudan Aids Network (SAN), which is a consortium of Non Governmental Organizations working on HIV/AIDS control.
In addition, the Sudanese Red Crescent has specific service agreements and works closely with the Ministry of Health and has an important and expanding role to continue to support the most vulnerable - especially youth, women and children - through the delivery of well-targeted programmes in the areas of communicable disease control, HIV/AIDS education and reproductive health.
Community health volunteer program
The objectives of the program are to address the basic health needs of the most vulnerable communities, increase awareness among the high risk groups and the community on health care, provision and first aid, reduce the number of deaths, injuries and impact from disasters, reduce the number of illnesses and impact from diseases and public health emergencies and prevention and control of water borne diseases.
Water and sanitation
This programme aims at contributing to integrated, healthy, peaceful Sudanese communities in all Sudan states by addressing the most urgent unmet humanitarian needs in the sector of water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH). The programme also works to improve the environmental health conditions through increased access to and utilization of water, sanitation and hygiene awareness rising services.

Comms Declare is a climate advocacy group within the professional areas of advertising, marketing, Public Relations and media in Australia that highlights we have a climate emergency requiring action on a professional level to address the climate crisis.
The organisation was co-founded by former news journalist Belinda Noble and communications professional Cally Jackson in early 2020.
“Fossil fuels are the new tobacco. Agencies that align their values with companies that are profiting from environmental damage will lose their best staff as well as clients that want a climate-friendly supply chain,” said Comms Declare co-founder, Belinda Noble. “The ground has shifted. The creative industries must move away from clients that are contributing to climate breakdown, for the sake of the planet, their reputations and bottom line,”
As at late 2021 Comms Declare is made up of 300 marketing, PR, advertising and media professionals, as well as 80 organisations that have committed to not supporting companies contributing to the growth of fossil fuel emissions in Australia.
Comms Declare founder and communications strategist, Belinda Noble says "We try to find and promote those who put climate front and centre of their communications work."
Publications
In late November 2021 Comms Declare launched a major report: Fuelling Fantasies: How the ad world is hindering climate action and protecting our biggest polluters, based upon a survey of 200 of Australia's top agencies in 2020 and 2021.
An earlier report in September 2021 prepared jointly by Comms Declare and Clean Creatives entitled The F-List 2021: 90 Ad and PR Companies Working for the Fossil Fuel Industry highlighted the 90 advertising, marketing and PR firms that have influenced policy decisions that would have cut greenhouse gas emissions.
Comms Declare contains a list of Comms organisations and individuals committed to climate action, and also publishes on its website a Polluter Relations list of advertising agencies supporting Major Fossil Fuel clients in Australia.

Delegation
Colombia sent a team of 39 athletes, 26 men and 13 women, and 1 official to the 2016 Summer Paralympics.
Disability classifications
Every participant at the Paralympics has their disability grouped into one of five disability categories; amputation, the condition may be congenital or sustained through injury or illness; cerebral palsy; wheelchair athletes, there is often overlap between this and other categories; visual impairment, including blindness; Les autres, any physical disability that does not fall strictly under one of the other categories, for example dwarfism or multiple sclerosis. Each Paralympic sport then has its own classifications, dependent upon the specific physical demands of competition. Events are given a code, made of numbers and letters, describing the type of event and classification of the athletes competing. Some sports, such as athletics, divide athletes by both the category and severity of their disabilities, other sports, for example swimming, group competitors from different categories together, the only separation being based on the severity of the disability.
Medalists

Rania Alayed was a 25-year-old mother-of-three murdered by her husband in June 2013, in Salford, Greater Manchester, England, in an act of uxoricide. Greater Manchester Police (GMP) Chief Detective Inspector Bill Reade described this as an honour killing, and the prosecutors stated she was murdered for trying to achieve independence from her husband and undergoing westernisation. Alayed's remains have never been found.
Background
Alayed was of Palestinian descent; she grew up in refugee camps in Syria where she met her husband Ahmed Al-Khatib, marrying him at age 15. Al-Khatib, who was a blacksmith by trade and nine years older than Alayed, was noted as being violent towards her from an early stage.
In February 2005, the couple moved to the United Kingdom, first settling in Norton, Teesside, before moving to Manchester.
According to testimony at Manchester Crown Court, following the move to England Al-Khatib became increasingly jealous and controlling of Alayed and subjected her to years of domestic and sexual violence. In January 2013, she reported him to the police for domestic abuse, obtained a non-molestation order and moved into a homeless hostel, from where she and her children were subsequently rehoused in Cheetham Hill, March 2013.
After the separation she took English classes at Openshaw College, made new friends and "embraced" her new life; Al-Khatib resided with family in nearby Gorton.
The couple had three children, two boys and a girl, and had been separated for only a few months at the time of her death, at age 25.
Crime and burial
On 7 June 2013, at the instigation of her estranged husband, Alayed went to her brother-in-law's home in Salford. According to Al-Khatib, she was to leave their children with him for the weekend and discuss plans for childcare.
Before Alayed's arrival, Al-Khatib's brother Muhanned had sent his partner and children away from the property and around 45 minutes after Alayed arrived was seen leaving the property himself, taking her children with him. Al-Khatib departed shortly thereafter, wearing some of Alayed's clothing in an attempt to give the impression that she had left the property alive. On his return, he put her body in a suitcase, which was then transported in Muhanned's motorhome, and moved to an unknown burial site.
After Al-Khatib had killed Alayed, he accessed her social media accounts and sent messages to her family pretending to be her and claiming to have moved to Turkey. His brother, Muhanned, gave her mobile phone to an acquaintance who was travelling to Turkey and had them text her father from there to say that she was getting remarried.
Friends raised concerns about Alayed's welfare when she failed to attend a meeting on 8 June, and this information was passed from Cleveland Police to Greater Manchester Police on 9 June. However, it was not until 2 July, and following a phone call from her uncle in Lebanon, that she was officially treated as a missing person.
When questioned on 3 July 2013, Al-Khatib claimed that he had not seen Alayed for months and that he thought she was living in Turkey or Syria, but he was duly arrested on 4 July on suspicion of murder and, shortly thereafter, his brother Muhanned contacted police and admitted that Alayed was dead. He claimed that her remains were buried near a layby along the A19 and Al-Khatib gave a similar version, stating that he had buried her near the A19 in Thirsk. The search for Alayed's remains encompassed a 19-mile stretch of the A19 and involved two police forces, teams from the Royal Engineers and RAF, along with specialist sniffer dogs, forensic botanists and archaeologists. The search was called off in September 2013, without success.
Trial and punishment
Ahmed Al-Khatib went on trial, alongside his brothers Hussain and Muhanned, at Manchester Crown Court in April 2014. He presented the partial defence of diminished responsibility, claiming that he was mentally ill and had killed Alayed in self-defence when she appeared to him in the form of an "evil apparition", or djinn. Throughout the trial, in an attempt to convince the jury that he was ill, he rocked back and forth, banged his head repeatedly against the dock and attacked both an interpreter and his brother.
His defence was rejected and he was found guilty of murder, with the Judge stating:
He received a life sentence with a minimum tariff of 20 years. In addition he pleaded guilty to "perverting the course of justice" for moving the body out of view of the authorities.
Muhanned Al-Khatib was acquitted of murder; he pleaded guilty to "intending to pervert the course of justice". His sentence was discounted to three years in jail because information he gave assisted in the successful prosecution of his brothers.
Hussain Al-Khatib was convicted of "intending to pervert the course of justice" and jailed for four years.
Aftermath
Alayed's case was one of three in 2013 which came within the jurisdiction of Greater Manchester Police (GMP) and in which a known victim of domestic abuse was murdered by their partner. The Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC), which took more than four years to complete its investigation, found ‘very serious concerns' and "recurring systems issues" in the way GMP handled domestic violence cases.
Various GMP staff investigated over their handling of Alayed's case were found to have displayed "poor" or "unsatisfactory" performance by the IPCC. None, however, were disciplined for misconduct.

The San Marcos Stakes is an American Grade II Thoroughbred horse race held annually in late January or early February at Santa Anita Park in Arcadia, California. Open to horses aged four and older, it is raced on turf over a distance of one and one-quarter miles.
Inaugurated in 1952 as a one-mile race on dirt, in 1954 it was changed to one and one-quarter miles and became Santa Anita Park's first graded stakes race on turf. It was raced on dirt again in 1956, 1962, 1969, 1973, 1975, 1978 through 1983, and in 1996.
Run as handicap prior to 2000, it is now raced under allowance weight conditions, with specified weight reductions for horses who meet certain conditions. It was open to three-year-olds and up from 1955 through 1959. There was no race held in 1970 and for 1978 it was set at a distance of 1 and one-eighth miles.

Dr. Henry Lumpkin Wilson (July 2, 1839 in Danville, Virginia – September 21, 1917 in Atlanta) was a prominent Atlanta physician, city councilman, and was active in the city's expansion and development.
Dr. Wilson was born in Danville, Virginia in 1839 and came to Atlanta in 1853. He graduated from Emory College at the original Oxford campus in 1858. He then became a doctor at Atlanta Medical College and was appointed as city physician. He served in the Confederate army and was made chief surgeon of the conscript department of Georgia. In 1872 he was elected to Atlanta City Council. He was chairman of the street committee and helped improved Whitehall, Marietta and Peachtree Streets. He was elected to the Fulton County commissioner in 1886 and was chairman of the committee of public works.
Soon after 1885 he opened a drug store at the corner of Broad and Marietta Streets.
After selling his drug business he entered the real estate business to become "one of the largest and boldest real estate men of the South", long in partnership with Frank P. Rice. in 1883 he was an incorporator of the Fulton County Street Railroad which brought horsecar service to Ponce de Leon Springs. Wilson is credited with giving the Springs their name. The line would later become the Nine-Mile Circle electric streetcar which would make accessible and thus enable the development of what is today Virginia-Highland and adjacent neighborhoods. Indeed, in 1914, Wilson sold 65 acres which would be subdivided into Boulevard Park, one of the original subdivisions of today's Virginia Highland.
He was also a director of the Cotton States and International Exposition Company.
Wilson was described as a "stubby blond man of medium height with a brusque manner and a quick keen glance". At one point Wilson resided in a grand house on Peachtree Street in today's Midtown Atlanta near the intersection of 5th Street.
He died in 1917 and was buried in Oakland Cemetery (Atlanta, Georgia).
Family
In 1895, Wilson's wife Mary Elizabeth, née Monk (1842-1915) compiled a cookbook that would later become known as the Atlanta Exposition Cookbook, a souvenir for women who visited the 1895 Cotton States and International Exposition.
Their son was W. T. Wilson who served on the Rhode Island Optometry Board.

Dawit Nega (; 11 April 1988 – 12 June 2022) was an Ethiopian singer whose prominence raised popularity of Tigrigna music. His songs were singled out at having a distinctive voice. His most popular songs include "Damana," "Baba Ellen," "Hidyat Mekelle," "Wezamay," "Zewidero," "Binetselay", "kudus tsebaya," and "Chocolata."
Life and career
Dawit lost his parents at a young age and he sold cigarettes, gum and other small goods on the streets to get his daily bread. Nega, who said that he had developed a deep passion for music since he was a child, at around the age of 15, with the aim of realizing his musical interests and dreams, asked to join the circus and music group "Circus Tigray." The request did not get a positive response in time but was given the opportunity to join the March band and play drums (Dram)."Success is always close to us," Dawit said in his interview, noting in his own life that "if you work hard and don't give up, it's not hard to reach your goals." Nega faced life challenges ranging from losing his parents to losing his daily bills and rent payments.
His last single released was titled "Ajoki Tigray," which he described as nostalgia for Tigray families who were separated and unable to meet due to the Tigray War that has been taking place since November 2020.
Dawit Nega was married and had one child.

Schneckloth v. Bustamonte, 412 U.S. 218 (1973), was a U.S. Supreme Court case that ruled that in a case involving a consent search, although knowledge of a right to refuse consent is a factor in determining whether a grant of consent to a search was voluntary, the state does not need to prove that the person who granted consent to search knew of the right to refuse consent under the Fourth Amendment.
Background
While on routine patrol in Sunnyvale, California, at approximately 2:40 in the morning, Officer James Rand stopped an automobile when he observed that one headlight and its license plate light were burned out. Six men were in the vehicle. Joe Alcala and the respondent, Robert Bustamonte, were in the front seat with Joe Gonzales, the driver. Three older men were seated in the rear. In response to the policeman's question, Gonzales could not produce a driver's license, Rand asked if any of the other five had any evidence of identification. Only Alcala produced a license, and he explained that the car was his brother's. After the six occupants had stepped out of the car at the officer's request, after two additional policemen had arrived, Rand asked Alcala if he could search the car. Alcala replied, "Sure, go ahead." Prior to the search, no one was threatened with arrest, and, according to Rand's uncontradicted testimony, it "was all very congenial at this time." Gonzales testified that Alcala actually helped in the search of the car by opening the trunk and glove compartment. In Gonzales' words:
"[T]he police officer asked Joe [Alcala], he goes, 'Does the trunk open?' And Joe said, 'Yes.' He went to the car and got the keys and opened up the trunk."
Wadded up under the left rear seat, the police officers found three checks that had previously been stolen from a car wash. The checks were later linked to Bustamonte (defendant), one of the six passengers riding in the car.
The trial judge denied Bustamonte's motion to suppress, and the checks in question were admitted in evidence at Bustamonte's trial.
Holding
The court held that consent searches are constitutional, and the government must show that consent existed. However, a defendant under the Fourth Amendment need not necessarily know of his right to object to a consent search. That differentiates the case from Miranda v. Arizona in which the Court held that defendants must know of their rights against self-incrimination in the course of a custodial interrogation.

Alarodians (Ancient Greek: Ἀλαρόδιοι (Alarodioi)) were tribe living in Northern Persia or Armenia during Classical antiquity.
According to Herodotus, the Alarodians were part of the 18th Satrapy of the Achaemenid Empire and formed a special contingent in the grand army of Xerxes I. Some scholars have tried to link the Alarodians to Urartians, suggesting that Alarodian was a variation of the name Urartian/Araratian. According to this theory, the Urartians of the 18th Satrapy were subsequently absorbed into the Armenian nation. Modern historians, however, have cast doubt on the Alarodian connection to the Urartians.
Nearly nothing is known about Alarodians except that they "were armed like the Colchians and Saspeires," according to Herodotus.
Use of term
The controversial Alarodian language theory, a proposed language family that encompasses the Northeast Caucasian languages and the extinct Hurro-Urartian languages, derives its name from the Alarodians.
An earlier, separate Alarodian language group was proposed by Joseph Karst in 1928. Karst's theory suggested a connection between the Armenian and Basque languages. This theory has also failed to gain mainstream support as Armenian and Basque do not even belong to the same language families.

Chapare mammarenavirus or Chapare virus is a virus from the family Arenaviridae which causes a hemorrhagic fever in humans known as Chapare hemorrhagic fever. It was first described after an outbreak of a novel zoonotic mammarenavirus infection occurred in the village of Samuzabeti, Chapare Province, Bolivia, in January 2003. A small number of people were infected and one person died.
In 2019, nine people became infected with the virus in the La Paz regional area, four of whom died. Nosocomial and human-to-human transmission of the virus occurred in at least three of the cases which resulted in the death of a medical intern and a gastroenterologist. Like other members of the Arenavirus family, the specific zoonotic reservoir and primary transmission vector is suspected to be a rodent, probably the small-eared pygmy rice rat.
Virology
The Chapare virus is an enveloped virus with a bi-segmented single-stranded ambisense RNA genome. The two RNA segments are denoted Small (S) and Large (L). It belongs to the New World Clade B lineage of mammarenaviruses and is most closely related to the Sabia virus.
Symptoms
After an incubation period of around 9–19 days, initial symptoms include fever, malaise, headache, myalgia, back pain, dizziness, nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea. The disease often progresses to include hemorrhagic and neurological symptoms, such as gingival hemorrhage, anaemia, leukopaenia, confusion, seizures, echymoses, bleeding from mucous membranes, hemorrhagic shock and multi-organ failure.
Chapare virus RNA was detected in the blood, urine, conjunctiva, semen and in broncho-alveolar and nasopharyngeal samples of the infected patients. Those who survived often had prolonged residual neurological symptoms. Viral RNA was detected in survivors up to 170 days after infection and infectious Chapare virus was obtained in a semen sample of one patient 86 days after symptom onset.
Treatment
Treatment relies mostly on supportive care and early diagnosis. Specific antiviral therapy for Chapare virus infection has yet to be properly investigated.

Kristoffer Throndsen (c. 1500–1565), posthumously also with the family name Rustung, was a squire, admiral, feudal overlord in Norway and Denmark, privateer captain and pirate. Kristoffer served Archbishop Olav Engelbrektsson, the interregnum leader of Norway, in the last years of the Kalmar Union.
Kristoffer is famous for playing a role in the last years before the Reformation in Norway, first as the head of the national fleet, defending Norway from attacking Danish ships; and also as the murderer of Vincent Lunge, a Danish nobleman sent to Bergen in 1536 to enforce the choice the King of Denmark Christian III as king of Norway. This dramatic moment in Norwegian history is memorialized today in an annual "midnight opera" sponsored by the Norwegian Ministry of Culture. Titled Olav Engelbrektsson, it takes place on the premises of the castle, outside Trondheim.
Kristoffer appealed for pardon from Christian III, probably for the murder but also for his piracy of the Norwegian coast under foreign flags, under which he attacked Danish ships and installations in Norway after 1536/1537. He was granted a post under the Danish crown, which badly needed a naval leader. He served for several years as an admiral in the Danish-Norwegian Navy, and later in Copenhagen as a Royal Danish Consul to the King.
His most famous child was Anna Throndsen, known in Norway as "the Scottish Lady" (Skottefruen). Anna is famous in modern-day Norway, for her days in the court of Mary Queen of Scots, during her marriage to James Hepburn, Lord Bothwell.
Biography
Early life
Kristoffer was probably born sometime around the year 1500 in Seim, Kvinnherad, a village in Western Norway. His ancestry or even who his parents were has not been widely established, although many theories have been suggested. The closest to contemporary sources primarily consist of two 17th century ancestry charts which says his parents were Trond Sigurdsson Rustung of Seim and Karen Koll of Nessa. Another source suggests that his father was Trond Engelbrekston and Karen Koll of Nessa. Which makes sense as during his adolescence Kristoffer was the graduate of the arch-Catholic University of Cologne with his cousins Gaute Taraldsson. Around the year 1526 to 1527, he moved to Trondheim, where he took service with the Archbishop Olav Engelbrektsson, who was his uncle. A diploma from this time diploma. Norw.7.789 and diplom.Norw.8.589-97, writes that Olav was the uncle of Christopher. Olav was the son of Engelbregt Gunnarsen and Jorunn Ivarsdatter Aspa. Engelbregt Gunnarsen was married twice, his second wife was Cecilie Mortensdatter Randa who was the mother of Trond Engelbrekston who was said to have been married to Karen Koll and the father of Kristoffer by some accounts. This connection does indicate that Olav was indeed Kristoffer's uncle.
The Reformation and turmoil
After moving to Trondheim around 1527 he became something of a right hand for archbishop Olav Engelbrektsson, the last catholic archbishop in Norway, and was a loyal support of his until 1537. Some have speculated that Kristoffer possibly was the nephew of Olav Engelbrektsson, primarily supported by a somewhat ambiguous source in which Mary of Austria, Queen of Hungary call Kristoffer his blutverwonter frundt ("relative by blood"), although the theory have been assisted by further circumstances.
In the same year, a pirate, Klement, came to Bergen where he captured the clergy as hostages. Vincens Lunge, the feudal overlord of Bergenhus at the time then formed a fleet, and also received aid from the archbishop who sent Kristoffer with a few ships. Lunge was however soon startled by rumours of the Danish king deposing the feudal lord of Akershus, and wanted Kristoffer to stay for his defence for a while. Kristoffer however became impatient, and eventually got himself accused of piracy after boarding Dutch, Scottish and English tradingships. James V of Scotland demanded the release of the ships Bonaventura and Pheyther from Vincens Lunge. Lunge then demanded that the stolen goods should be replaced or the guilty being executed, with Olaf Lang and Kristoffer being most to blame. When Kristoffer arrived in Bergen, he and his men was soon arrested, only to find himself and most of his men escaping from prison one early morning.
The relationship between Vincens Lunge and the Catholic archbishop gradually worsened during the 1530s, resulting in numerous conflicts between them, as well as Inger, Lady of Austraat. Before this happened, Kristoffer had been in the top reach of Dano-Norwegian politics. In 1531, Kristoffer and the archbishop changed their loyalty from Frederick I to Christian II, resulting in conflicts which led to Kristoffer being forced to withdraw to Steinvikholm Castle, of which he likely was the lord for a few years. Lunge in 1535 traveled to Trondheim to negotiate peace in the conflict. With increasing tensions, it was soon however declared that Lunge and three other members were to be executed, and Kristoffer and his men soon went on and killed Lunge.
Kristoffer was then sent to capture Lunge's estate in Bergen, but was betrayed and imprisoned in Bergenhus Fortress. Not long after however, Kristoffer was exchanged for the diplomat Eske Bille who had been captured earlier by the archbishop. In 1536 Kristoffer arrived in Burgundy to help them against the Danes, and returned to Trondheim with a few ships. He could not help the luck of the archbishop however, and in 1537 they fled Trondheim for the Netherlands, barely managing to escape.
Later years
The next years, Kristoffer operated as a privateer, with a letter of marque titled "Christoph von Trundheim, Marskalk in Norweger" from Frederick II, Count Palatine of the Rhine. Under protection from Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor, and Mary of Burgundy, he got involved in Charles V's war against France. One time he left from Veere in Zeeland with three ships, and ended up taking nine ships from the French.
He settled in Emden and became good friends with Count Enno II of East Frisia. Under his protection, he raided the Norwegian coast many times, including Utstein Abbey and Stavanger bispegård in 1539. During this time he boarded many tradingships, and though the Danish king sent scouts after him he was never caught.
Around 1542-43 he got pardoned by Christian III of Denmark after he had applied for it, and was engaged as a naval officer, which Denmark-Norway had a desperate need for. As Kristoffer had risen to fame, the kings advisors had advised the king to pardon him if he was to join them. At first he only had charge of a small ship with a crew of 20 people, however after only three months, he advanced to admiral, titled Admiral of the Kingdoms (Rigernes Admiral). When he was admiral he was in charge of 40 ships with a crew of 5000 people. At the time he was the only Norwegian with a leader position in the navy. His missions included sailing to Iceland to calm down a small rebellion, and later fighting with his fleet in the Northern Seven Years' War against the Swedish-Norwegian admiral Jakob Bagge.
Kristoffer died in 1565 at around the age of 65, and is probably buried in the Church of Kvinnherad.
Family
Kristoffer was married to Karen Knutsdatter, whose full name is revealed from a 1569 court case. The same ancestry charts which makes the claim for Kristoffer's parents, also hold Karen with the family name Schanke, and her father as Knut Pedersen, archdeacon of Trondheim – also attributed with the Schanke name (which he is not contemporaneously known by, and which his own seal seem to contradict).
Kristoffer had eight known children together with Karen:
Enno; the only son, made a living as a highwayman before being executed. Married a trader's daughter from Danzig, but left no descendants.
Anna (nicknamed Skottefruen); married the Scottish admiral James Hepburn, 4th Earl of Bothwell. (Noting that Scots history records her inaccurately as a mistress; Norwegian history otherwise.)
Kristine; married Torbjørn Olavsen Nes.
Magdalene; married the væpner (squire) Erik Eriksen Orm of Vatne and Valvatne, and left many descendants. Their granddaughter was the mother of admiral Lauritz Galtung. He was third great grandfather of the Russian national poet Alexander Pushkin.
Dorthea (in Scottish sources called Dorthie Trunsie); married Sir William Stewart of Lutherie, Lord Lyon King of Arms.
Else; first married to Jon Haard (the Elder) of Gjersvik, secondly to Axel Frederiksen Fridag, senior judge in Bergen, and finally to Anders Mowatt of Hugoland. One notable descendant is the physician-scientist Kenneth B. Christopher, the eleventh great grandson of Else and Mowatt.
Maren; married Olav Jonson Theiste of Bjelland (in Kvinnherad). One notable descendant was the lawman Nicolas Bergh.
Margrethe; first married to Danish nobleman Jørgen Pedersen Staur of Hervik (in Ølen) and secondly to Amund Lauritzen/Lassesen Dal of Sandvik and Malkenes. Left many descendants.
Rustung name
Kristoffer never used the family name "Rustung" himself (a name he has later been popularized by), as it is rather a late 17th-century Danish invention of currently unknown origins. Contemporary naming of him, by others and himself, consist of various spelling variations of "Christoffer Trondsson". He is known to have written his signature "Christoffer Trundsß", suggesting that he himself was the origin of the family name "Tronds" which many of his daughters is known to have used. Such a creation of family names, by shortening the patronym, was common in the Netherlands in the 16th and 17th century, suggesting that Kristoffer changed his name according to this Dutch trend.
His name is denoted with the letters K and T in his seal. In his seal there is a coat of arms, and it is uncertain if he created this coat of arms himself or if it was inherited from his ancestors. The coat of arms is repeated in several heraldic books, such as that of his descendant Nicolas Bergh.

Freeze spray (cold spray or vapocoolant) is a type of aerosol spray product containing a liquified gas used for rapidly cooling surfaces, in medical and industrial applications. It is usually sold in hand-held spray cans. It may consist of various substances, which produce different temperatures, depending on the application.
Some of them are highly flammable. Several other types of compressed gas sprays also have a freezing effect: for example, tetrafluoroethane, gas dusters, liquid nitrogen, and carbon dioxide fire extinguishers.
Applications
Industrial
For spot-cooling of electronic components during troubleshooting, dimethyl ether or tetrafluoroethane may be used.
Freeze sprays are also used to contract metal for assembly or disassembly of interference fit parts.
The extreme temperature can cause viscoelastic materials to change to glass phase. Thus it is useful for removing many types of pressure sensitive adhesives.
Medical
In medical applications, spray cans containing dimethyl ether or tetrafluoroethane may also be used to freeze and destroy tissue, for removal of warts and skin tags, or other uses in cryosurgery. Liquified petroleum gas including propane and butane is sometimes used. These all may also be used as a topical anesthetic, due to the numbing effect of cold, though there is risk of frostbite.
Chloroethane may be used as a topical pain reliever, and an alternative to ice pack therapy to reduce inflammation and swelling. Since its boiling point is well above the freezing point of water, there is less risk of freezing the skin, though it can still be dangerous if misused. It may be used to treat sports injuries, where it is sometimes known as ice spray or magic spray.
Other
Freeze spray has been shown useful for the field marking of animals; for example marking the tails of monkeys. Research is continuing to help control the application dosage and time to minimize permanent damage to the animals.

Sigmund "Sig" Anderman (born 1941) is an American businessman, attorney, and philanthropist.
Education
Anderman was born in New York City in 1941 and attended New York public schools, graduating from City College of New York with a B.S. in Education in 1962. He earned a Bachelor of Laws degree from New York University in 1965.
Career
After graduating, Anderman worked for the law firm of Winer, Neuburger and Sive (now Sive, Paget and Reisel), a New York law firm specializing in corporate and environmental law. For many years, he along with partner, David Sive, was part of the legal team handling lawsuits that defined the environmental movement in America. He participated in Scenic Hudson Preservation Conference v. Federal Power Commission (1971). The case, for the first time in American jurisprudence, gave standing for bringing a lawsuit to a citizens group without a financial interest in the project. The project proponent, Con Edison, eventually abandoned the project. Committee for Nuclear Responsibility, Inc. v. Schlesinger (1971), argued before the Supreme Court of the United States. That case, which sought to enjoin the government's testing of a nuclear bomb under Amchitka, Alaska was eventually lost, but brought public attention to the risks and potential environmental damage from underground nuclear bomb testing.
In 1979, Anderman changed careers, becoming Chief Executive Officer of American Home Shield Corporation, the pioneering home warranty company that he helped found in 1973. After American Home Shield was sold in 1982 (still the dominant home warranty company in the country), Anderman started CompuFund, Inc., a computerized mortgage origination company, founded in 1982; and Inspectech, Inc., a computerized home inspection service, founded in 1992.
In 1998, Anderman founded Ellie Mae. He was president and Chief Executive Officer of Ellie Mae from 1998 to 2015, and until April 2019 was Executive Chairman of the Board. In 2019, Ellie Mae was purchased by private equity firm Thoma Bravo for $3.7 Billion .
Anderman's wrote several books and articles relating to entrepreneurship, including The Eight Patterns of Highly Effective Entrepreneurs by New York Times' writer Brent Bowers, Small Business Growth Strategies, and Leadership Plans for CEOs: Top CEOs on Building a Team, Achieving Goals and Delivering Value,” by Aspatore, and Tom Peters' “Re-Imagine!: Business Excellence in a Disruptive Age,” and the 2005 Tom Peters' PBS Special on Business Excellence and Innovation.

Georg Carabelli, Edler von Lunkaszprie (Squire of Lunkaszprie) (Hungarian: Carabelli György) (December 11, 1787, Pest – October 24, 1842, Vienna) was a prominent Hungarian dentist and professor of dental surgery in Vienna. He held a minor noble rank, which referenced the town
of Lunkaszprie (now Luncasprie, in Bihor County Romania).
Georg Carabelli was a court dentist to the Austrian Emperor and co-founder of the stomatology clinic at the University of Vienna. The Cusp of Carabelli, a small additional cusp sometimes found on the mesiolingual corner of an upper molar, was first illustrated in his textbook of oral anatomy, published in 1842, and later described in his handbook of dentistry, published posthumously in 1844. He wrote numerous textbooks and monographs.

The Mississippi 8 Conference (M8) is a high school athletic and activities conference in the Twin Cities area in Central Minnesota with 8 member high schools. The conference derives its name from 6 of the original 8 member schools being located within 10 miles from the Mississippi River.
History
The M8 was formed in 2004 with eight charter members: Becker, Big Lake, Buffalo, Cambridge-Isanti, Monticello, Princeton, Rogers and St. Michael-Albertville (STMA), and began play in the 2005-2006 school year. Zimmerman High School was added to the conference in 2008.
Elk River High School entered the M8 as a competitor in the sport of football in 2010 and Duluth East and Duluth Denfeld High Schools joined the conference for football in the fall of 2012. St. Francis, Chisago Lakes Area, and North Branch Area High School began competing in the Mississippi 8 Conference during 2013-14 school year.
Princeton School District and Zimmerman High School voted to withdraw their participation from the Mississippi 8 in favor of a new conference, Granite Ridge Conference, for the 2011 school year. Becker School District, and Elk River High School left the conference in 2012, Becker joined the Granite Ridge Conference, and Elk River High School football rejoined the Northwest Suburban Conference. In the 2013-14 school year, Princeton rejoined the M8. In 2018 STMA and Buffalo decided to leave the conference and were placed in the Lake Conference by the MSHSL and Rogers decided to leave for the Northwest Suburban Conference beginning in the Fall of 2019. Becker High School rejoined the conference in 2019 bringing the total number of schools back to 8.
Members
The conference currently consists of 8 member schools.

After the 2014 football season schools in the state of Minnesota were placed into one of 18 districts. The purpose of the changes was to reduce scheduling headaches for several schools. All of the schools in the Mississippi 8 Conference were placed into the North Central District for the 2015 season. Prior to the 2017 season STMA was reclassified to 6A, as a result the school plays in the Metro District and North Branch was moved to the Northeast District. The other schools continue to play in the North Central District.

Alexander Baumgartner (born in St. Gall, Switzerland, 27 June 1841; died Luxembourg, 1910) was a poet and writer on the history of literature.
He was nominated for the Nobel Prize in Literature three times.
Life
His father was Gallus Jacob Baumgartner, a prominent statesman. At the abbey school of Maria Einsiedeln in Switzerland, where Alexander when fourteen years old began his higher studies, he was influenced by the well-known poet and scholar, Father Gall Morel. The boy's intellectual bent was confirmed at the Jesuit school at Feldkirch, where he spent his last two high school years. After passing an examination he entered the Society of Jesus in 1860. After his studies in 1874 he was assigned to the editorial staff of the periodical Stimmen aus Maria-Laach, which had been founded three years before. He wrote for the journal for thirty-six years, with writings of his appearing in virtually every issue. Owing to the expulsion of the Jesuits from Germany, he repeatedly changed the place of publication of the periodical.
He also took two long journeys. In 1883 he went to Iceland, the Faroe Islands, Scandinavia, and the provinces of the Baltic as far as St. Petersburg, Russia. Three years later he visited Denmark, Sweden, and Norway. Both tours are commemorated in his travel books, Nordische Fahrten (1889 and 1890). He was buried in the cemetery in Luxembourg near his old friend and countryman, the Jesuit Father Joseph Spillman.
Writings
Some of his poetry was written for special occasions, including Festspiel zur Calderonfeier (1881), which appeared first in the Stimmen aus Maria-Laach, but was soon, owing to repeated requests, published in book form with a brief biography of the Spanish poet Calderon. A translation into Spanish by Orti y Lara of the artistic work soon followed. His Lauretanische Litanei in fifty-nine sonnets was also written for a special occasion and was printed for the first time in 1883 and translated into Dutch in 1890. He also translated foreign poetry, for instance, in 1884, an Icelandic poem of the fourteenth century to the Virgin Mary, Die Lilie.
He also wrote numerous articles on the history of literature in the Stimmen aus Maria-Laach, which were collected and issued in 1912 as a supplementary volume to his Geschichte der Weltliteratur, all written with the intent that they should form part of his larger history and life work. In earlier years, as preparatory writings, he had issued Lessings religioser Entwicklungsgang (1877), Longfellow (1887), an appreciation of the poems of Henry Wadsworth Longfellow which passed into a second edition ten years later, Joost van den Vondel (1882), a biography of the Dutch author translated four years later into Dutch, and lastly a biography of Goethe in three volumes (1879).
In addition he published two works as expressions of gratitude and religious piety: Erinnerungen an Bischof Greith (1884), and Gallus Jakob Baumgartner (1892). Two years previously he had issued the unfinished work of his father, Die Geschichte des Kantons St. Gallen, in three volumes. The six volumes of his history of the literature of the world are: "Westasien und die Nillander" (1897); "Indien und Ostasien" (1897); "Die klassische Literatur der Griechen und Römer" (1900); "Die lateinische und griechische Literatur der christlichen Volker" (1900); "Die französische Literatur" (1905); and lastly "Die italienische Literatur" (1911), during the writing of which he died. The thoroughly Catholic point of view in all his works is self-evident. His strong religious convictions led him to take part in the dispute over Catholic literature by the publication of the pamphlet Die Stellung der deutschen Katholiken zur neueren Literatur.

WUDT-LD (channel 23) is a low-power television station in Detroit, Michigan, United States, owned and operated by the Daystar Television Network. The station's transmitter is located at 8 Mile and Meyers Road in suburban Oak Park.
History
The station took to the air on January 4, 1989, as low-power W05BN on channel 5. It then became WBXD-LP on September 1, 1995, reflecting its affiliation with, and ownership by, The Box, which was acquired by Viacom in 1999 and merged into its MTV2 in 2001. The sale to Viacom put WBXD under the same ownership as UPN station WKBD (channel 50) and, after Viacom's merger with CBS, WWJ-TV (channel 62).
On January 30, 2001, the station moved to channel 35 and then to channel 23 on July 12, 2001. Then on June 27, 2002, the station began operating at class A status, giving it the call sign WBXD-CA.
Viacom sold WBXD-CA to Equity Broadcasting in November 2004. The new owners renamed the station WUDT-CA, and made the station an affiliate of Univision. In 2007, Equity Broadcasting was renamed Equity Media Holdings Corporation. WUDT-CA was the first Spanish-language television station to take to the air in the state of Michigan since W66BV, Detroit's prior Univision affiliate, became a TBN translator in the early-1990s.
During its time with Univision, WUDT was also one of only three stations affiliated with the network (along with KUNS-TV in Seattle and Univision O&O WQHS-TV in Cleveland) in markets bordering Canada. Univision's over-the-air presence in Detroit made Detroit/Windsor the only market in the United States or Canada with terrestrial stations in English, Spanish and French—the French station was Radio-Canada owned-and-operated station CBEFT on channel 35, a former originating station which rebroadcast Toronto's CBLFT-DT before going dark in 2012.
WUDT's master control was remotely originated via satellite from Equity's headquarters in Little Rock, Arkansas. Equity maintained a local news and advertising sales office at 5600 King Street in Troy. The station had limited backup signal transmission arrangements; during several instances of bad weather, WUDT-CA often broadcast either a black screen or a "NO SIGNAL" message.
On March 28, 2007, Comcast added WUDT to its Detroit lineup on channel 65, replacing the network's national East Coast feed, which had been carried since the 1980s when Comcast in the Detroit area was split up between several companies (for example, it was known as Barden Cablevision in Detroit proper and Inkster; Cablevision Industries in Dearborn; Continental Cablevision in Southfield, Dearborn Heights, Madison Heights and Hazel Park; Harron Cable in Port Huron; Omnicom in far western Wayne County (including Canton Charter Township) and Hamtramck; Maclean Hunter in many Downriver communities; and Tele-Communications Inc. in several Oakland County suburbs and the Downriver communities of Lincoln Park, Riverview, Woodhaven, Trenton and Gibraltar), and when Univision was known as Spanish International Network (SIN). However, it was never available on WOW! Detroit, Bright House Livonia, Wyandotte Municipal Services or Cogeco Windsor; WOW continued to carry the national feed instead, while Bright House does not have the station or the network on any of its lineups in Livonia, Farmington, Novi or Redford, and Wyandotte Municipal Services also does not carry the station or the network on its lineup in the city of Wyandotte. Cogeco Windsor does not carry Univision in any form due to restrictions set by the CRTC. Comcast later moved the station to channel 18 in Detroit to make room for the Michigan feed of the Big Ten Network, which now occupies channel 65.
Due to the 2008 bankruptcy of Equity Broadcasting, WUDT was sold at auction to the Daystar Television Network on April 16, 2009; the sale closed in July 2009. In August 2009, the station began to show only a slide with the Univision logo and station identification. Comcast immediately removed WUDT from its lineup and reverted to carrying the national Univision feed. On August 26, at about 5PM, WUDT switched to Daystar. This left Detroit without a full-time Spanish-language outlet.
On April 6, 2010, WUDT switched off its analog signal and broadcast on digital channel 8. At some point in mid-June 2010, WUDT-LD went silent, returning to the air as of July 27, 2010.
Daystar reached a deal to sell WUDT-CD, along with WSVT-CD in Tampa, Florida, to LocusPoint Networks in December 2012. The deal will make it a sister station to two other Detroit stations, WDWO-CD (which LocusPoint acquired in March 2013) and W33BY (which LocusPoint acquired in April 2014). In the meantime, in May 2013, Daystar surrendered the class A status for WUDT and three other stations.
On December 15, 2014, Ion Media Networks, the owners of WPXD-TV, reached a deal to donate its translator station W48AV (channel 48) in St. Clair Shores to Daystar. As part of the transaction, Daystar requested a special temporary authority for it to relocate to UHF 23, the same channel as WUDT-LD; this was granted.
News
From 2005 until June 2008, the station presented a nightly newscast, produced and anchored in Denver, Colorado, with stories produced in the Detroit area originating from the station's offices in Troy. On June 6, 2008, Equity discontinued local newscasts at its six Univision affiliates, including WUDT.
Trivia
WUDT was the largest of Equity's three television stations in Michigan. Equity also owned and operated Retro Jams affiliate WUHQ-LP in Grand Rapids and dual-Fox/MyNetworkTV affiliate WMQF in Marquette (now WZMQ). WUHQ would also be sold to Daystar, with WMQF being sold to a Wisconsin company, MMMRC, LLC.
Equity would also acquire another former MTV2 station, WBWX-CA, now WUMN-LP channel 13 in Minneapolis, also a Univision affiliate. WUMN, along with its sister station, Telefutura affiliate WTMS-CA, channel 7, would be sold to Silver Point Capital. WUMN is owned today by the Media Vista Group, while WTMS had ceased operations.
Equity's presence was felt elsewhere in Detroit as ABC affiliate WXYZ-TV began its service of the Retro Television Network, which began broadcasting starting in the spring of 2008 as RTN7. Equity (which once owned RTN) and the E. W. Scripps Company made the deal official on September 21, 2007. Shortly after WXYZ launched RTN7, the network was sold to Luken Communications, LLC. RTN, later reacronymed "RTV", was seen on WXYZ-TV until 2011, when it was replaced with the Live Well Network.
Technical information
The station operates with an effective radiated power of 15 kilowatts with a directional antenna, covering the immediate Detroit and Windsor areas, plus large parts of southern Oakland and Macomb counties and small portions of Wayne and Essex counties.
Subchannels
The station's digital signal is multiplexed:
The station applied for a license to operate digitally on VHF channel 8. The application was filed and a construction permit was granted on October 10, 2007 and it expires on October 11, 2010. The station went on air shortly after. WUDT's digital signal was between the digital signals of WJBK-TV on channel 7 and CBET-DT on channel 9, which may cause some interference. This may also cause interference with Cleveland's WJW in the southeastern areas of Essex County, which has its digital signal on channel 8 as well.
Analog-to-digital conversion
Because of reception challenges, Daystar subsequently filed an application to permit WUDT to broadcast its digital signal on channel 23, its old analog frequency, at 15 kW, directional. The application was granted by the FCC on January 17, 2012, with the construction permit expiring September 1, 2015. As a low-power station, WUDT was not required to transition to digital television when full service stations were required to do so in 2009; however, all low-powered stations, including WUDT, must make the transition by September 1, 2015. On May 3, 2012, the station moved back to UHF 23, increasing power substantially from 300 to 15,000 watts. On May 10, 2012, the station upgraded to class A digital status, becoming WUDT-CD; a year later, Daystar elected to revert the station to a traditional low-power license.
At some point in May 2015, WUDT-LD went silent, having been merged into its now-sister station, W48AV-D, which has since switched to digital operations as a Daystar station. While WUDT-LD's license remains active (and both remain owned by Daystar via its Word of God Fellowship subsidiary), though W48AV-D's license would be cancelled in 2016, with the station re-assuming the identity of WUDT-LD.

Dick Vitale's "Awesome, Baby!" College Hoops is a college basketball sports game developed and published by Time Warner Interactive for the Sega Genesis in 1994. Directed by Richard Seaborne, the game features the voice and likeness of the basketball sportscaster Dick Vitale and prominently features his quotes and catchphrases. Players play as multiple college basketball teams from the United States in a 3D court that automatically rotates to fit to the player's position, which was a major selling point for the game.
Dick Vitale's "Awesome, Baby!" College Hoops received generally positive reviews from critics. The game's graphics and self-rotating court was praised, with GameFan calling the game a "technical marvel". Critics were more negative towards the game's soundtrack and sound effects; GamePro called the soundtrack "terrible" and stated that players would either "love" or "hate" Vitale's commentary.
Gameplay
Dick Vitale's "Awesome, Baby!" College Hoops is a basketball sports game and sees players playing as different college basketball teams from the United States. The game is similar to the basketball sport and is played in a self-rotating 3D court and is divided into three main modes: Tournament, 2-on-2, and Single. In the tournament mode, the player goes against other teams in a tournament; in the 2-on-2 mode, players compete in a basketball 2-on-2; in the single mode, the player competes in a single game of basketball. Players can get coached by Vitale if they select the "View Plays" option. A time-out can be called by pressing the start, A, and B buttons simultaneously. Players can also force a foul play by mashing the A and C buttons. The game also has a practice mode, where players can "learn the ropes" of the game.
Gameplay will be altered depending on the player's settings; the game has six speed and three difficulty settings. Matches will speed up if the graphic detail is set to low. In the options menu, players can also turn off Vitale's commentary.
Development, marketing, and release
Dick Vitale's "Awesome, Baby!" College Hoops was developed by the California-based Time Warner Interactive. Development is likely to have begun prior to June 23, 1993, as the game's commercial refers to its developer as Tengen, Time Warner Interactive's name prior to Tengen being acquired by Time Warner. The game was directed by Richard Seaborne; produced by Mitzi McGilvary and Bill Hindorff; designed by Jose Erazo, Doug Gray, and Jules Marino; programmed by Michael Alexander, Seaborne, and Charles Tolman, and composed by Earl Vickers and Doug Brandon. The game was developed solely through the Sega Genesis software; however, it still managed to achieve scaling and rotation.
Advertisements for the game were included in multiple video game magazines from 1994 to 1995, such as the 21st issue of Sega Visions, the 66th issue of GamePro, and the 5th issue of EGM2. The game's self-rotating 3D court was a key marketing point for Dick Vitale's "Awesome, Baby!" College Hoops, with it appearing in adverts and the game's commercial. In an advert on an issue of GamePro, Vitale stated that he was "proud" to have his likeness in the game due to it being very similar to actual college basketball. Time Warner Interactive also released a commercial to promote the game.
Dick Vitale's "Awesome, Baby!" College Hoops later released in late 1994, which is indicated by the timeframe of when it was actively covered in video game magazines. At an unknown date, the game was also released in Australia.
Reception
Dick Vitale's "Awesome, Baby!" College Hoops was generally received positively by critics; the game's graphics and self-rotating court was described as "colorful, high-res, and smooth". GameFan called the game a "technical marvel in more ways than one" and called the basketball players in the game "well-animated". Critics criticized the game's soundtrack, with Sega Visions rating it 2/5. Critics compared the game to the NCAA Football series and NCAA Basketball for the Super NES. AllGame compared the game to College Slam and Coach K College Basketball, two other college basketball games for the Sega Genesis.
The game's gameplay was described as "fun" and "unique" by Sega Visions; GameFan felt that the game's play mechanics were basic, but stated that he felt that the game was "attractive" to him due to the developers being "willing to take some chances", which made the game more "sophisticated". GamePro felt that the game "scores high" in its amount of content.
The game's sound was highly criticized by critics and was described as "awful". Vitale's commentary received mixed reception; GameFan was positive to it, while GamePro felt that players would eventually grow annoyed at the commentary, and suggested that people should eventually turn it off in the options menu.
Aaron Thomas of VentureBeat was critical towards the game's box art, ironically calling it "quite possible [that Time Warner Interactive] used scissors and tape" to make it. In 2011, Game Informer Jeff Marchiafava listed Dick Vitale's "Awesome, Baby!" College Hoops as one of the weirdest video games based around celebrities.

Harris (2016 population: ) is a village in the Canadian province of Saskatchewan within the Rural Municipality of Harris No. 316 and Census Division No. 12. It was the site of the Great Ruby Hoax in 1914. Harris was named for Richard Elford Harris, an early settler to the area.

In the 2016 Census of Population, the Village of Harris recorded a population of living in of its total private dwellings, a change from its 2011 population of . With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2016.
History
Prior to the arrival of European settlers, First Nations people, most likely Plains Cree, inhabited the land around Harris. Evidence of this occupation is still evident in the Bear Hills north of Harris where a turtle effigy, vision quest sites, a cluster of nine stone rings and rock cairns dot the landscape.
The modern history of Harris begins in the early 20th century. The town of Harris was named after Richard Elford Harris, an Ontario-born carriage maker and carpenter, who decided to move west with his two sons and a daughter in 1904. The Harris family travelled from Saskatoon on the Old Bone Trail before striking out for land on what was later known as Crystal Beach. The Harris sod house became known as the “Harris Stopping Place” for settlers moving into the area and served as a rest place for travellers to rest themselves and their animals as well as get a hot meal before the Harris men escorted them to their homesteads. The flood of people lead to the establishment of a store, a Methodist church and a post office with Mr. Harris serving as the first postmaster. .
As the Goose Lake Rail Line, the name given the Canadian Northern Railway line connecting Calgary with Saskatoon, approached the community, it was soon realized that the surveyors had made plans to lay the line two miles away. The townsfolk quickly purchased land along the new rail line from a local homesteader and moved the entire community to its current location on mile 52 of the Goose Lake Line. The move necessitated a new name for the community. Several names were considered but when permission was granted to Richard Harris to move his post office to the new site, the Harris name went with it and so was born; Harris, Saskatchewan. In the fall of 1908, the first train rolled through the community. Harris incorporated as a village on August 10, 1909.
As the 20th century rolled on, the community witnessed many changes. Many businesses opened and closed over the years, leaving behind many important examples of early 20th century architecture in the community (see "Historic Buildings" below.) In 1916 the first telephone company was established in town and on its heels, cement sidewalks were poured in the 1920s and a decade later, in 1930, power came to Harris. In 1955 Sask Power established a natural gas utility with a gravity sewer system following in 1960. The 1970s saw the village undertake a large street paving effort that was completed by 1980 and in 1976 the municipal water treatment plant and distribution system was established. Today, the village of Harris boasts nearly 200 residents and many thriving businesses.
Historic buildings
There are several buildings designated as Municipal Heritage Properties in Harris, these include:
St. Brigitte Roman Catholic Church is a one-storey, wood-frame church with steeple, completed in 1909.
Rural Municipality of Harris #316 Office is the oldest remaining office building in the Village of Harris
Harris United ChurcH is a one-storey, wood-frame church with corner bell tower, which was completed in 1924.
Royal Bank of Canada is a one-storey, red-brick bank building that was constructed in 1922.
Old Harris Canadian National Railway Water Tower is an octagonal-shaped wooden water tower that was constructed in 1934.
The Great Ruby Rush
This is the incredible tale of one of the more bizarre episodes in Saskatchewan history; The Great Ruby Rush. The story goes something like this: One hot, dry day in the summer of 1914, while working on a road gang in the Bear Hills about 20 miles northwest of Harris, Alex McCarthy, an American miner, new to town, spotted some red nuggets in a big black rock. He suspected that they might be rubies. Sensing opportunity, he stashed the stones in a cigar box and headed for the Commercial Hotel in Harris. Over a glass of beer, McCarthy showed the rubies to the Gordon Brothers, proprietors of the hotel, who were known to have some mining experience.
The Gordons quickly made their way to Saskatoon to stake their claim. While there, word somehow got out about the ruby discovery. Headlines in the Saskatoon Star newspaper proclaimed a ruby and gold discovery near Harris. Word spread fast and within days, thousands of prospectors arrived in Harris seeking their fortune. The Ruby Rush was on! The Gordon brothers took full advantage of the Ruby Rush. “Rubies” from the site of the discovery – a large black stone from the Bear Hills – were put on display at the hotel. The entrepreneurial Gordons supplied the miners with everything they could possibly need; lumber, food, alcohol and even prostitutes in a saloon, a restaurant and other entertainment in three large tents that they established on the site. Drunkenness was rampant, to the point that one man was found dead from alcohol poisoning. Less than two weeks later, word came from Saskatoon that the rubies were not really rubies at all but worthless garnets and just as soon as it had started, the Ruby Rush was dead.
Rumours persisted for years that the entire was a hoax created by the Gordon Brothers, as a money making scheme. For years afterwards, the Ruby Rush was a taboo subject in town, due in no small part to the main players and their families still lived in town. Today, the town is not so shy about its connection to the Great Ruby rush, in fact, they have embraced the story. The original "ruby" bearing rock is displayed prominently in town outside of the museum. For years, every July, the town celebrated the annual Ruby Rush Days. The hotel in town is named The Harris Hotel Ruby Rock Pub & Grill.
The plaque, erected by the Saskatchewan History & Folklore Society and mounted on the large rock next to the Harris Museum reads in part:

Harris is the birthplace of National Hockey League left-winger, Quintin Laing.

U.S. Route 52 (US 52) skirts the western fringes of the U.S. state of West Virginia. It runs from the Virginia state line near Bluefield, where it is concurrent with Interstate 77 (I-77), in a general northwest and north direction to I-64 at Kenova. There it turns east, overlapping I-64 for before splitting off onto the West Huntington Expressway into Ohio via the West Huntington Bridge. Despite having an even number, US 52 is signed north–south in West Virginia. In some other states along its route, it is signed east-west. The West Virginia segment is signed such that US 52 north corresponds to the general westward direction of the highway, and vice versa. For a while, US 52 parallels US 23, which is on the other side of the Big Sandy River in Kentucky. This continues into Ohio, where US 52 travels on the Ohio side of the Ohio River while US 23 travels on the Kentucky side.
Most of the route is being upgraded to a high-speed four-lane divided highway, but not to interstate standards. It has been designated as part of the I-73 and I-74 corridors. From I-77 south of Bluefield to near Williamson, the new highway has been referenced to as the King Coal Highway; from Williamson north to Kenova, it is the Tolsia Highway.
History
West Huntington Expressway
The West Huntington Expressway is a controlled-access elevated highway that crosses the west end of Huntington WV. It was constructed in 1965 and originally signed as West Virginia Route 94 (WV 94). The first segment to open was a stub from I-64 to Jefferson Avenue in West Huntington in the fall of 1965. This included a bridge over a CSX railroad mainline. In the early 1970s, the expressway was extended northward across what is now the Nick Joe Rahall II Bridge across the Ohio River to US 52 and State Route 7 in Ohio.
Tolls were collected at the Ohio River bridge until the mid-1980s. The expressway has four lanes from I-64 to the US 60 interchange, where it drops to two lanes for the remainder of the highway, which includes the Ohio River bridge. The expressway was renumbered US 52 in 1979 when that highway was re-routed out of downtown Huntington to a new alignment on I-64 west to the Tolsia Highway south of Kenova.
Tolsia Highway
The Tolsia Highway is defined as running from I-64 at Kenova to Corridor G (US 119) north of Williamson. The name Tolsia takes the names from the first initials of the Tug, Ohio, Levisa, and Sandy Improvement Association. US 52 originally took the path of WV 152, approximately east of the current alignment. In the mid-1960s, state funding was secured to upgrade most County Route 1 (CR 1), which ran along the Big Sandy River and Tug Fork River. The upgraded CR 1 and CR 29 was renumbered as US 52 in 1979.
Portions of the highway have been upgraded to four lanes. In 1998, US 52 south of the I-64 interchange in Kenova was upgraded to four-lane highway standards to the access road for Tri-State Airport. In that same year, the Prichard bypass was opened to traffic with one interchange and one at-grade intersection. This bypass includes very large rock cuts and a long and winding grade down a hill. In 2001, the four-lane highway was extended southward approximately to a stub interchange with WV 75. Also in that year, the four-lane highway near Prichard was extended northward for , removing some grades and curves along US 52. The extension was completed in 2002 at a cost of $9.6 million.
In 2001, the Crum segment of the Tolsia Highway opened to traffic. The highway begins just north of Crum at an incomplete diamond interchange and heads eastward towards CR 2. It has at-grade intersections with CR 52-47 and CR 52-31 along with a side road at the eastern terminus that takes traffic to CR 2. There are stubs for future bridges and ramps. Signage along this segment is minimal, with only a handful of arrows to designate the route. While the highway was built to four-lane standards, it is only striped for two.
In late 2002, Senator Robert C. Byrd received $20 million in funds to jump-start construction on the northern half of the Tolsia Highway. The money would be used to speed up construction on the link between Huntington and Prichard, serving several industrial parks and relieving two-lane US 52 of coal-truck congestion.
In 2003, survey and design of of four-lane US 52 upgrades from Prichard north to Cyrus were completed. Plans include an interchange and five bridge structures.
Williamson Bypass
US 52 enters Kentucky twice along the Williamson, West Virginia bypass; bridging the Tug Fork River was preferred because it prevented the blasting of several hillsides in West Virginia. It was completed in 1996 as part of the Corridor G (US 119) project. The speed limit in West Virginia is but drops to in Kentucky.
Future
The Tolsia Highway is expected to meet the King Coal Highway at WV 65 and Corridor G (US 119).
King Coal Highway
The King Coal Highway is defined to run from WV 65 and Corridor G (US 119) near Belo, West Virginia, to I-77 at its US 52 interchange near Bluefield. The Coalfields Expressway (US 121) and the Shawnee Expressway will connect to the King Coal Highway.
The travel time, currently over 120 minutes from Williamson to Bluefield, will be reduced to 87 minutes. South of Ikes Fork, a two-hour trip to Bluefield will be reduced to 44 minutes.
Interchanges and intersections proposed for the King Coal Highway include:

Construction began in 1999 on the three-level diamond interchange on Indian Ridge near Welch that will facilitate traffic between the King Coal Highway (US 52, Interstate 73/74) and the Coalfields Expressway (US 121). Initial site work was completed in 2003, with grading evident; this required the filling in of a large valley. It will also be the site of a new state prison along with future industrial development.
Work has progressed on the four-lane upgrading of US 52 in Mercer County just east of Bluefield. On November 24, a contract totalling $2,057,914 was let to move approximately of dirt and to grade and drain .22 miles from the recently completed $27 million interchange with Corridor Q (US 460) east of Bluefield to US 19 just north of James P. Bailey Lake. Six buildings will be demolished. This is the first of several projects that will extend the King Coal Highway to West Virginia Route 123 (Airport Road) north of Bluefield. Extending this project east, another contract was awarded December 15 and totals $1,371,251. The contract calls for more than of excavation to grade and drain .18 mile of the King Coal Highway from county route 25 just north of the US 460 interchange to south of the old Raleigh-Grayson Turnpike. 36 buildings will be demolished. A future contract will include a bridge over US 19 which will cost $15 million.
Design work is being commenced on a segment of the King Coal Highway from Horsepen Mountain to Isaban and from the Mercer County Interchange to West Virginia Route 123/Airport Road. The work being done on a section of highway near Horsepen Mountain is being done by mining companies that will save taxpayers over $20 million.
The total cost for both the Tolsia and King Coal Highways will be over $2 billion.

Launa Q. Newman (December 30, 1920 – February 3, 2009) was an American journalist and social activist based in Minneapolis, Minnesota. She is known for her social contributions in the South Minneapolis area for the African-American community. She was also the publisher of The Minneapolis Spokesman and St. Paul Recorder (later merged to Minnesota Spokesman-Recorder), along with her husband Cecil Newman.
Personal life
Launa Newman was born in Topeka, Kansas to Gilber Quincy and Ethel Quincy. At the age of two, her family relocated to Des Moines, Iowa. At Des Moines, Gilber started a tailoring and cleaning business. She married her first husband Wallace O'Neal Jackman in Des Moines. She had two children with Jackman. She moved to the Twin Cities in 1958. After nine years, she married her second husband, Cecil Earl Newman in 1967.
Journalist career
Cecil and Launa were fierce advocates for "non-racist Minneapolis and St. Paul". Cecil started the two newspapers, the Minneapolis Spokesman and the St. Paul Recorder, in 1934. The office space of the two newspapers was moved to 3744 Fourth Avenue South in 1958. When Cecil was heading the publication, Launa started to help her husband by working in the circulation area and carrying out the public relation works. Gradually she started to cater the managerial responsibilities of the community run media house and as the confidant to Cecil.
After her husband's death in 1978, Launa took the charge of the newspaper and modernized the printing system and operational aspects. The two separate newspaper were merged in Minnesota Spokesman-Recorder in 2000. Launa relinquished the charge of the business to her children Oscar Newman (son of Cecil), Norma Jean Williams and Wallace Jackman (children of Wallace O'Neal Jackman) and devoted her times to community service. She served on the board of Minneapolis Boy's Club and was the member of Minneapolis Women's Club. In 2007, she officially sold the newspaper business to her granddaughter Tracey Williams and retired from her journalistic career after serving for the newspaper for 32 years.
Legacy
In November 2019, the Mayor and the City Council of Minneapolis announced a commemorative honor to Launa Newman along with activist Clarissa Walker by renaming the 38th Street corridor to their names respectively. The announcement says "Launa Q. Newman Way will run from East 36th Street to East 42nd Street along 4th Avenue South in Minneapolis".

St. Stanislaus Parish (), designated for Polish immigrants in New Haven, Connecticut, United States, was founded on December 28, 1901. It is one of the Polish-American Roman Catholic parishes in New England in the Archdiocese of Hartford.
History
The parish had its beginnings in 1896 when the Polish immigrants from the city of New Haven came together to form the St. Stanislaus Society. This society became the nucleus for the future St. Stanislaus Parish. Initially the group gathered for Mass at a German Catholic Church in New Haven but in 1900, they began to make plans for a location of their own. A delegation from the St. Stanislaus Society petitioned Most Reverend Michael Tierney of the Hartford Diocese for permission to organize a parish. Bishop Tierney agreed and appointed Reverent Stanislaus Musiel to be pastored of the rising parish.
Father Musiel celebrated the first Mass for the newly founded parish in a German hall on Wooster Street. A year later, in 1901, the pastor purchased a home and grocery store on Dwight Street and had it converted to a chapel.
In 1903, the Bishop entrusted the new parish to the Polish Vincentian Fathers and Reverend George Glogowski, CM, became the pastor. The Vincentians began their stewardship of the parish by offering a popular mission. The mission was a great spiritual experience for those who attended. The mission also revealed that the number of Polish immigrants in New Haven was far greater than expected. Their original chapel on Dwight Street would not be adequate to accommodate the numbers.
The pastor, Father Glogowski, bought an old Swedish church with two houses on St. John Street. The church was large enough to accommodate the growing numbers of parishioners but it also supplied a rectory for the priests. The church was renovated and a steeple was added. Most Reverend Michael Tierney, Bishop of Hartford, dedicated the church on Decoration Day in 1905 and placed it under the patronage of St. Stanislaus.
In 1907 Reverend Anthony Mazurkiewicz, CM, became pastor. During his years as pastor, Father Mazurkiewicz eliminated the parish debt and opened a parochial school for the parish children in the basement of the Church.
The parish continued to grow rapidly and by 1910 it was evident that they had outgrown both the church and the parish school. Father Mazurkiewicz began to look for a property that would be more centrally located in the city of New Haven. He found an abandoned church on the corner of State and Eld Streets, the present location of St. Stanislaus Parish.
By 1911, the property was cleared and the foundation for the present church was laid. On Decoration Day in 1912, Most Reverent John Joseph Nilan, Bishop of Hartford, blessed the cornerstone of the new church, designed in the Polish Cathedral style. Just a year later, on April 27, 1913, the first Mass was said in the new church. A solemn Mass of dedication was celebrated by Bishop Nilan on May 30, 1913.
The parochial school was moved to the basement of the church where it remained for the next nine years. The parish also quickly acquired the adjacent lots and properties. In 1921, the parish demolished three houses on State Street in order to build a new school. It was completed in 1929.
The interior of the church has changed over the years. In 1925, the pastor, Reverend Joseph Janowski, CM, commissioned artist P. Mazur to paint the many frescoes on the interior of the church. Stained glass windows from Aachen, Germany were installed in 1926.
In 1942 the pastor, Reverend Karol Pacherski, CM, commissioned Vincent Murdo of New Haven to beautify the interior of the church. “The Christianization of Poland in the 10th Century,” was chosen as the theme. The renovations were completed in 1943. A blessing for the redecorated church was held on October 11, 1943. In 1972, the original organ was rebuilt. After the Second Vatican Council, a new altar was installed. The rendition of the Last Supper was moved from the high altar to the front of the new altar. The last major renovation in the church took place in anticipation of the 100 year anniversary of the parish by then pastor, Reverend Waclaw Hlond, CM.
On April 25, 1979, the New Haven Preservation Trust proclaimed the church building noteworthy for its distinguished interior.
In September 2009, a regularly scheduled traditional Latin mass hosted by the St. Gregory Society of New Haven was commenced. The Mass is celebrated every Sunday at 2:00 pm.

Restructuring of New Haven Parishes
In October 2021, Archbishop Leonard Paul Blair announced a major restructuring of parishes in New Haven into a municipal model parish, whereby all 10 churches in the city, including Saint Stanislaus, would be consolidated into single parish corporation administered on the premises of St. Mary Church. As part of the reorganization, the Vincentian Fathers left St. Stanislaus at the end of 2021, and diocesan priests were assigned to administer the parish. The newly appointed pastor of St. Mary Parish would guide the transition process and eventually become pastor of the consolidated city-wide parish. The St. Mary Priory building would house the pastor and associate priests appointed to serve the churches in New Haven. The formal consolidation is tentatively planned to occur in 2022 or 2023; all 10 church buildings in the city would remain open for Sunday mass in the initial phase of the consolidation.

John Louis Treflé (4 December 1865 – 11 January 1915) was a farmer, newspaper proprietor and politician in New South Wales, Australia.
Early life
He was born at Penshurst near Hamilton in Victoria to French Canadian farmer John Trefflée Hétu, known as John Treflé in Australia and Mary McKenzie. He attended a convent school at Hamilton. The family moved to Temora, New South Wales around 1876, and Treflé was a boarder at St Patrick's College, Goulburn. On leaving school he worked on his father's farm at Temora, before branching out into newspapers, becoming owner and managing editor of the Temora Independent.
Political career
Treflé was active in the Cootamundra land boards and the Farmers and Settlers Association, serving as secretary of the association from 1893 until 1898 and as vice-president from 1902 to 1940 and 1905 to 1906. He was a friend of member William Holman whose seat of Grenfell included Temora and his mother and brother joined Labour in the 1890s. Treflé attempted unsuccessfully to forge links between the Farmers and Settlers Association and Labour, particularly in relation to agricultural policy and plans for a national bank. In 1904 he was a candidate at the election for The Upper Hunter, with the support of the Farmers and Settlers Association, but was unsuccessful with a margin of 955 votes (21.0%).
In 1906 he joined Labour and was their candidate for Castlereagh at the by-election for The Castlereagh in 1906, winning with a margin of 328 votes (1.1%) and holding the seat at the elections in 1907, 1910 and 1913. When Labour won the 1910 election, he was appointed an honorary minister without a portfolio in the McGowen ministry until 1911, when he was appointed Minister of Agriculture following the death of Donald Macdonell. George Beeby, the Secretary for Lands, resigned from the ministry, parliament and party in protest at the power of the extra-parliamentary Labor Party executive in December 1912 and Treflé took on the additional portfolio of Lands. He retained both portfolios in the first Holman ministry, before dropping the agriculture portfolio in 1914.
Personal life
Treflé married Kathleen Shelly on 23 April 1902 in Manly. Treflé died in Sydney on , survived by his wife Kathleen, their daughter, also named Kathleen (aged 12) and son Liola (aged 9).

The Early College High School Initiative in the United States allows students to receive a high school diploma and an associate degree, or up to two years of college credit, by taking a mixture of high school and college classes. This differs from dual enrollment, where students are enrolled in a traditional high school and take college classes, whereas early college students take high school classes in preparation for full college workloads. At early colleges, students also have fewer high school classes because some of their college classes replace their high school classes. Early colleges differ from closely related middle colleges. ECHS students spend their school day at college, and go to their home school occasionally for events such as football games, homecoming, and prom.
The ECHS Initiative began in 2002 with funding from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, among others. The first early college in the United States, Bard College at Simon's Rock, was founded in 1966. Today, more than 230 early colleges across 28 states serve 50,000+ students.
Data
92% of early college students graduate from high school, versus the national rate of 69 percent.
86% of graduates from enroll in college the next semester after high school graduation.
91% of early college graduates from earn transferable college credit.
44% of graduates at schools open 4+ years earn at least one year of college credit.
24% of graduates at schools open 4+ years earn two years of college credit or an associate degree.
70% of early college students are students of color.
59% of early college students are classified as eligible for free or reduced lunch (used as a conservative estimate of how many students' families are low-income). Most early colleges are funded to target first generation college, low-income families, and/or academically gifted students.
Intermediary partners
Fifteen intermediary partners work directly with early college schools, school districts, and postsecondary institutions. They provide start-up and ongoing technical support, guidance, and professional development for their networks of schools.

The pale-bellied tapaculo (Scytalopus griseicollis), also known as the matorral tapaculo or rufous-rumped tapaculo, is a species of bird in the family Rhinocryptidae. It is found in Colombia and Venezuela.
Taxonomy and systematics
The pale-bellied tapaculo has three recognized subspecies, the nominate Scytalopus griseicollis griseicollis, S. griseicollis gilesi, and S. griseicollis morenoi. The last of these was not described until 2015. Pale-bellied tapaculo was formerly considered a subspecies of Magellanic tapaculo (S. magellanicus). The putative Scytalopus infasciatus has been variously proposed as a subspecies of pale-bellied or brown-rumped (S. latebricola) tapaculos, as a synonym for Merida tapaculo (S. meridanus), and as a species in its own right ("Cundinamarca tapaculo"). As of 2021, it is considered "inseparable from the nominate" pale-bellied.
Description
The pale-bellied tapaculo is long. The nominate subspecies weighs . One male S. g. morenoi weighed and two male S. g. gilesi . The nominate adult is mostly gray, lighter on the underside. Its back and wings are brownish gray. The rump, flanks, and vent are orange-brown. S. g. gelesi has a darker back with less brown and darker (slate gray) underparts. S. g. morenoi has a brown mantle.
Distribution and habitat
The pale-bellied tapaculo inhabits the Eastern Andes of Colombia. The nominate is found in Cundinamarca and Boyacá Departments. S. g. gilesi is found in Santander Department, northeast of the nominate. S. g. morenoi is found in northern Santander Department, Norte de Santander Department, and slightly into adjacent Venezuela. It inhabits low scrub in elfin forest and páramo at elevations of . It is also, but rarely, found in montane and oak forest. Locally it can be found in Chusquea bamboo stands, and it appears to tolerate disturbed and fragmented habitat.
Behavior
Feeding
The pale-bellied tapaculo is assumed to be insectivorous but few details of its diet or foraging phenology are known.
Breeding
The pale-bellied tapaculo's breeding phenology is also very poorly known. An adult S. g. morenoi was in breeding condition when collected in August and fledglings of that subspecies were collected in April, June, and September. Fledglings of S. g. gelesi were collected between June and December.
Vocalization
The songs of pale-bellied tapaculo subspecies differ somewhat, but all are a trill, sometimes preceded by a single note . The scold call is also a trill .
Status
The IUCN has assessed the pale-bellied tapaculo as being of The Least Concern. However, S. g. gelesi has a limited range and the habitat of S. g. morenoi is very badly fragmented and degraded.

It was selected as the Portuguese entry for Best International Feature Film at the 93rd Academy Awards after Portugal's first entry, Listen, was disqualified.
Synopsis
Vitalina Varela follows its titular character, a Cape Verdean woman who arrives in Lisbon to meet her husband who's been gone for 40 years. As soon as she lands in the capital, she learns that he died three days ago. We follow Vitalina through the shanty town of Fontainhas as she navigates the traces that her husband left behind, discovering his secrets and his illicit life.
Release

Reception
Critical response
On the review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of based on reviews, with an average rating of . The website's critical consensus reads, "Rigorous and beautifully composed, Vitalina Varela is a quietly absorbing drama whose placid surface belies hidden depths." Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 86 out of 100, based on 15 critics, indicating "Universal acclaim".
Sight & Sound considered it the tenth best film of 2019, even saying: "Varela's performance is elemental, forged in fire. It never ceases to astonish just what miracles Costa is able to wrest from non-actors, or more accurately, coach them to wrest from themselves, but this is probably the most formidable performance, and the most potent screen presence, as yet in his work."

The Uttar Pradesh Public Service Commission (), commonly abbreviated as UPPSC, is Uttar Pradesh's state agency for recruitment of all the entry-level appointments to the various
Group A and Group B Civil Services of Uttar Pradesh. The agency's charter is granted by the Constitution of India. Articles 315 to 323 of Part XIV of the constitution, titled Services Under the Union and the States, provide for a Public Service Commission for the Union and for each state.
History
The Uttar Pradesh Public Service Commission (UPPSC) came into existence on 1 April 1937, with the main aim of recruiting candidates to various services in the state. The commission is regulated by Uttar Pradesh Public Service Commission Regulation, 1976.
Origin
Indianisation of the superior Civil Services became one of the major demands of the political movement compelling the British Indian Government to consider the setting up of a Public Service Commission for recruitment to its services in the territory. Under the Government of India Act 1935, for the first time, provision was made for the formation of Public Service Commissions at the provincial level. Uttar Pradesh Public Service Commission was constituted on 1 April 1937 with its headquarters at Allahabad.
The working of Uttar Pradesh Public Service Commission is also regulated by Uttar Pradesh Public Service Commission Regulation, 1976.

Controversies
On 26 September 2013, Allahabad High Court ordered UPPSC to cancel the Mains Examination of UP Provincial Civil Services (Judicial) 2013, over alleged irregularities in the Answer Key issued by it. The word key allegedly had incorrect multiple–choice options marked as correct.
On 29 March 2015, the question paper of the UPPSC PCS Preliminary exam was leaked before the exam. It led to a protest and subsequently, the cancellation of the morning shift exam. The police said that they would find the person who had sold the question paper on Whatsapp for Rs.5 Lakh per copy.

Metrosideros bartlettii, also known as Bartlett's rātā, Cape Reinga white rātā or in Māori as rātā moehau, is one of twelve Metrosideros species endemic to New Zealand and is notable for its extreme rarity and its white flowers, somewhat uncommon in that genus of red-flowered trees and plants. Its natural range is in the far north of the North Island at Te Paki, in three patches of dense native forest near Spirits Bay (34° S) that escaped destruction by fire, namely Radar Bush, Kohuronaki Bush, and Unuwhao Bush. Only 13 adult trees are known to exist in the wild (down from 34 in 1992) and most of these are either ill or dying. The lack of fossil evidence elsewhere suggests that the tree may always have been restricted to the North Cape area, which was an island until it was connected to the mainland by the sandspit that constitutes Ninety Mile Beach.
Description
Metrosideros bartlettii was discovered by John Bartlett, a schoolteacher from Auckland, in 1975. He found an unusual tree growing in Radar Bush, 9.5 km south-east of Cape Reinga. Almost ten years passed before the flowers were collected, making possible a scientific description of the tree. Bartlett's rātā grows to a height of up to thirty metres, usually beginning life as a hemi-epiphyte on taraire (Beilschmiedia tarairi), puriri (Vitex lucens), rewarewa (Knightia excelsa) or tree ferns (Cyathea spp.). Occasionally, the tree is found growing on the ground on rock outcrops and rocky cliffs. The tree bears white flowers made up of a mass of stamens in November or December. Seed ripens in March or April. The trunk is up to 1.5 m in diameter. Bartlett's rātā resembles northern rātā (Metrosideros robusta) but can be distinguished by the small white flowers and by the leaves, which taper to a point at the tip, while those of northern rātā are notched at the tip. Also distinctive is the white or whitish-grey bark that peels easily into soft flakes, which it is thought may offer resistance to fire damage. This may have been a key factor in the tree's precarious survival in an area prone to forest fire.
Conservation
Although the plant is in cultivation, the majority of cultivated plants come from one tree. Only 13 adult Bartlett's rātā are known to exist in the wild, and most of these are growing on privately owned land. Many of the specimens are isolated from other trees with the result that there is minimal transfer of pollen and few seeds are set. Analyses of the DNA have shown that there is very little genetic variation. The species is also vulnerable to browsing animals, and at risk of destruction by fire or by changes in the land management practices of the landowners.
Iwi Ngāti Kurī and the Department of Conservation have been working to restore tree numbers, including 360 trees planted into Radar Bush and Kohuronaki Bush. Work is also going into planting at Unuwhao Bush (the tree's current stronghold), as well as establishing new sites in the Far North utilising seedlings from all three remaining pockets of established trees, to maximise the remaining genetic diversity.
Cultivation
Bartlett's rātā grows readily from fresh seed, and prefers sunny sites with fertile, well drained soil. It can also be propagated from hardwood cuttings, although these may be very slow to take root. Plants in cultivation in New Zealand are relatively hardy in a range of conditions, and have shown tolerance of mild frosts, which are unknown in the natural habitat.

Beat Noir is fourth studio album by Spahn Ranch, released on October 19, 1998 by Out of Line and Sub/Mission Records. It was reissued on November 24 of that year by Cleopatra Records. The final track "An Exit" was licensed to Cleopatra Records to be released on the various artists compilation The Black Bible in 1998.
Reception
AllMusic gave Beat Noir gave two and a half out of five possible stars. Music critic Dave Thompson said "from the infectious opening riff of "Fire Lives in the Hearts of All Men," to the near reverent melodies entwined within the synth structure of "Ride like Lightning Crash like Thunder," a tight, edgy, yet absolutely hummable album that is solid throughout." Ink 19 was negatively critical of the album's misdirected experimentation and claimed that Athan Maroulis' vocal choices were unsuited for the album's genre.

Vincent William de Roulet (1925 – August 11, 1975) was an American businessman, politician, and statesman. He served as United States Ambassador to Jamaica from 1969 through 1973.
Biography
De Roulet was born in Los Angeles, California. He lived there until moving to Manhasset, New York in 1954.
Business career
De Roulet was elected to the board of directors of the Meadow Brook National Bank in 1964. He also owned Towne-Oller and Associates, a market research firm. De Roulet served as mayor of North Hills, New York.
Ambassadorship
De Roulet was appointed United States Ambassador to Jamaica by President Richard M. Nixon in August 1969, and presented his credentials on October 23, 1969. While serving as ambassador, he allegedly sought political contributions from American corporations for foreign elections; Alcoa gave these contributions to Jamaican officials. He left the post on July 18, 1973, when the Government of Jamaica declared him persona non grata; Michael Manley, the Prime Minister of Jamaica, requested that de Roulet be recalled after it was revealed that de Roulet suggested the United States Congress makes a pre-election political deal before the 1972 Jamaican elections. He officially resigned in August.
During the hearings of the United States Senate Watergate Committee, it was alleged that de Roulet received an "express commitment" from the Nixon administration through Herbert W. Kalmbach, Nixon's personal lawyer, to receive a more prestigious ambassadorship in Europe in exchange for a campaign donation of $100,000 to Nixon's 1972 re-election campaign; de Roulet and Nixon both denied the charge.
Personal life
De Roulet married Lorinda de Roulet (née Payson), the daughter of Joan Whitney Payson and Charles Shipman Payson, in 1951. The couple had three children, daughters Whitney and Bebe, and son Daniel. De Roulet died in 1975 of a heart attack.

Jean Cameron (b. 1921/22 – ), was a World War II Scottish rural postwoman who, at the age of 19, challenged and thus changed the dress-code for postwomen to permit wearing of trousers. The uniform trousers were known as 'Camerons' in her honour. Films were made on her successful action in 1944 and 2021. She is named in the Royal Mail 500 years archive (2017), and in the Kirriemuir town (2021) community art project, Signs of Change.
Background
During World War II, women took on roles previously dominated by men, in the United Kingdom. This included serving what was then called the General Post Office, now Royal Mail. Jean Cameron, the postwoman who served in Glen Clova, a rural area, had asked to wear trousers. In 1941 she had persuaded the management that the official uniform be changed for the first time, to allow postwomen to wear a skirt or trousers. Within two months of the option being available, 500 pairs were ordered, by November 1943, 14,000 pairs of what had become known as 'Camerons' had been issued, then all 16,000 postwomen were sent a pair of the trousers.
As Glen Clova 'postie', Cameron had a long route and tough terrain to deliver mail, shopping and urgent telegrams, either by bicycle or on foot; she had to cross burns (streams) and stone stiles, as well as walking rough rocky paths or muddy bogs.
A war-time newsreel titled Mail and the Female. A Highland Postie Starts a Fashion' showed postbags of trousers being delivered to all 16,000 female posties. It includes scenes of Cameron travelling through snow by bicycle, and then crossing a river on foot, in her trouser uniform. It also showed the postwomen in their 'Camerons', starting their mail round in bomb-damaged London. It included a re-enactment of a phone-call between Cameron and the District Postmaster, when he asks what skirt size she needs for her uniform, Cameron replies that she would 'prefer trousers', in Scots 'breeks'.
Another 1944 film, The Coming of the Camerons, directed by amateur, Frank M. Marshall, which told her story, was Highly commended in 1945 by the Institute of Amateur Cinematographers, and highlighted the importance of post in wartime, including a minister whose son was a prisoner of war, or remote farmers relying on the 'postie' for newspaper & shopping.
A section on Cameron's impact on women's rights was included in a 2021 BBC documentary covering the river South Esk.
Reaction
When interviewed for film in 1944, Cameron said that 'thousands of posties' would be dressing like this in future. 'But I was the first, and I shouldn't be a woman if I wasn't pleased to be the first to start a fashion.'
Women wearing trousers in the 1940s was seen as controversial, although they did so in more roles, for practical reasons, as the war went on. Picture Post carried the story and joked 'it is not a question so much, 'should women wear trousers', the answer obviously being yes, but 'when, where and how'.
The design of the 'Camerons' was in line with the red and blue postal uniform and were quickly popular with female staff.
Commemoration
In 2016-17, Cameron was celebrated as one of the Scots who 'helped shape the 500-year history of the Royal Mail'.
As part of a community art project in Kirriemuir, Cameron was chosen as one of the 'trailblazers' to be commemorated.
In 2021, Cameron was described in a BBC documentary as having 'revolutionised female fashion in the workplace' and having described her ideal uniform requirements for the rough route she travelled in the glen, as 'a sturdy pair of breeks'.

Serge Thion (25 April 1942 – 15 October 2017, Créteil) was a French sociologist. A former researcher at the French National Center for Scientific Research, he was dismissed from his position at the center for Holocaust denial activities.
Career
Thion worked as a researcher at the French National Centre for Scientific Research (CNRS) from 1971 to 2000. Most of his research there focused on Cambodia and Vietnam. Thion was the subject of some controversy when he wrote that "genocide" was, technically, not a proper description of what happened in Cambodia during the Khmer Rouge rule, because it was not a type (or an attempt) of killing based on purely ethnic grounds. According to Thion:The reality is that genocide, massacres, wiping out entire peoples or cultures, and other inhuman atrocities, torture, massive corruption, and so on, are part and parcel of government policies, most usually applied to foreign countries. There is no other law than the law of the jungle. If we want to change this situation, we must reform our own laws first, strip the authorities of their political immunity, abolish the "Reason of State" and the system of official secrecy which covers up all these crimes. If we could reach a stage in which any official would be tried according to the same rules that apply to you and me, to any other ordinary human being, we would not need all these extraordinary concepts because common law is quite enough.
I of course fully agree that Pol Pot should be prevented by any means from returning to power. I find it a bit paradoxical that so much blame was poured on the Vietnamese, who did just that, prevent Pol Pot from coming back, by people who did so much to promote the same Pol Pot and insisted he kept his seat in the United Nations. I am also fully in favour of a trial of Pol Pot and of his accomplices and his foreign associates, including American, Thai and Chinese officials who conspired to support him when he was in power and after his fall. I suggest the application of the ordinary Cambodian law for events which took place in Cambodia.
Genocide is nothing else but a political label aiming at the exclusion of a political leader or party beyond the bonds of humanity. It leads us to believe we are good, that we have nothing to do with these monsters. This is entirely misleading. Pol Pot has been produced by our political world, is part of it, is using it and is getting strong from it. Before saying he is dirty – which is what he is without a doubt – we should clean our own house first.
Holocaust denial
In 1993 Thion privately published Une Allumette sur la banquise (A Matchstick on an Ice Flow). The book criticized what he perceived as sensationalization of the Holocaust compared to other mass deaths since World War II. He criticized the prosecution of Robert Faurisson for Holocaust denial, and cast doubt on the accuracy of Filip Müller's book Eyewitness Auschwitz. He met Noam Chomsky during the 1970s and presented his editor Pierre Guillaume for publication.
Thion has been described as a Holocaust denier, and in November 2000 was dismissed from CNRS for Holocaust denial activities.
He was condemned and fined for defamation by the French Correctional Tribunal Court of Appeal in December 2002 for attacks on writer Didier Daeninckx. Thion attended the 2006 International Conference to Review the Global Vision of the Holocaust in Iran, often described as a Holocaust denial conference.
Israeli philosopher Elhanan Yakira has cited Thion and his friend Alain Guionnet, as one of a number of deniers on the radical left (and right) in France whose extreme views on the Holocaust have made Holocaust denial "a central issue in France and elsewhere".

The Robertson Nature Reserve is a protected rainforest nature reserve that is located in the Southern Highlands region of New South Wales, in eastern Australia. The reserve is situated near on the edge of the Illawarra Escarpment and is a remnant of the Yarrawa Brush, once in size.
Features
A track through the forest is suitable to wheelchairs, with several signs with information on local plants and animals. The reserve is situated on the outskirts of Robertson, at above sea level.
Despite the relatively rich basaltic soils, and of average annual rainfall, the rainforest has a low canopy, with only a few trees taller than . Because of small size and isolation, the reserve is subject to weed attack. Chinese Privet and Glossy Privet, Holly and Himalayan Blackberry being particularly troublesome.
The rainforest is categorised as warm temperate rainforest, (not cool temperate), with the canopy dominated by trees such as Golden Sassafras, Coachwood, Lilly Pilly, Native Daphne, Possumwood, Beefwood, Featherwood and Blackwood. Genuine cool temperate rainforest trees such as Pinkwood and Black Olive Berry are either absent or inconspicuous. A common tree species is the Brown Beech, usually associated with tropical or sub-tropical rainforests.

Al-Nasir Kilij Arslan (also known as Kilij Arslan and Kiliç Arslan) was the Ayyubid emir of Hama from 1221 to 1229 (617AH–626AH). He was the son of al-Mansur I Muhammad and the younger brother of al-Muzaffar II Mahmud. The name Kilij Arslan (lion sword) was presumably homage to the Sultans of Rûm, four of whom bore this name.
Accession
In 1219, al-Mansur called together the leading men of Hama and made them swear allegiance to his eldest son, al-Muzaffar Mahmud, as his heir apparent, before sending al-Muzaffar to Egypt to aid sultan al-Kamil. Some time later he sent his second son, an-Nasir Kilij Arslan to join al-Mu'azzam in his campaigns in Palestine. However, as he lay dying, some of the leading emirs decided to invite an-Nasir back to Hama to usurp the throne in place of his brother, in the hope that they would be able to exercise real control under his nominal rule. Al-Mansur died in January 1221 (Dhu'l Qada 617), and an-Nasir duly installed himself as ruler in Hama. He was on campaign with al-Mu'azzam, emir of Damascus at the time of his father's death, and al-Mu'azzam would only agree to release him to return to Hama if he promised to pay 40,000 dirhams once he had control of the city.
In Egypt, when al-Muzaffar learned of his father's death, he obtained Sultan al-Kamil's permission to go and claim his throne. On reaching Syria however he found his brother firmly established on the throne. None of the notables of Hama would support him in removing an-Nasir, and none of the other Ayyubid princes in Syria was interested in helping him, so he had to return to Egypt, where he was given an estate by al-Kamil. The two contenders for the throne of Hama were now aligned with the two major players whose rivalry divided the Ayyubid political world—al-Mu'azzam of Damascus and al-Kamil of Egypt. The rightful heir of Hama, al-Muzaffar, had the backing of al-Kamil, and Kilij Arslan looked to al-Mu'azzam for protection. Kilij Arslan managed to upset his backer however when he made overtures to a third leading Ayyubid emir, al-Ashraf, and failed to pay the 40,000 dirhams he had promised to al-Mu'azzam.
Al-Mu'azzam therefore set out on a campaign to take Hama. Kilij Arslan was out hunting, but managed to hurry back into the city and hold it against the attackers. Rather than embark on a long siege, al-Muazzam took the towns of Salamiyah and Maarrat al-Nu'man for himself. In January 1223 (Dhu'l Hijja 619) he renewed his attack on Hama. However the prospect of the emir of Damascus taking Hama and becoming dominant throughout Syria prompted both al-Ashraf and al-Kamil to unite in demanding that al-Mu'azzam withdraw and leave Hama untouched. In the negotiations which followed, al-Mu'azzam had to return all of the territory he had taken and Kilij Arslan was left in control of Hama. He was however obliged to turn the city of Salamiyah over to his brother al-Muzaffar.
Deposition
Five years later, in November 1228 (Dhu'l Hijja 625), another set of negotiations took place at Tell al-Ajjul near Gaza between al-Kamil and al-Ashraf as they sought to agree a balance of power between them across the Ayyubid realms. The result was a comprehensive agreement on the redistribution of domains. Al-Kamil's client al-Muzaffar was to be restored to Hama, together with Baarin and Maarrat an-Nu'man. Salamiyah was to be detached from the Hama domain and given to al-Mujahid of Homs.
Al-Ashraf and a-Kamil now worked in tandem to put this plan into effect, and al-Kamil led his armies to Damascus in support of al-Ashraf who was laying siege to it. The city surrendered in June and almost at once, al-Kamil turned his attention to Hama. On 25 July 1229 (2 Ramadan 626) al-Kamil, in alliance with al-Mujahid of Homs, laid siege to Hama to remove Kilij Arslan and restore al-Muzaffar. After a few days of siege Kilij Arslan came out to negotiate, and eventually agreed to leave Hama in return for receiving the fortress of Montferrand near Baarin. Eventually, Kilij Arslan died on the same year.

Acanthoscurria insubtilis also known as the Bolivian black velvet tarantula, is a spider which was first described by Eugène Simon in 1892. It is found in Bolivia some reports also stating in Brazil, though it is mainly in the Bolivian Rainforests.
Description
Males have a dark brown or black coloration, with pinkish hairs on the opisthosoma, carapace and legs. Females own this same coloration, though the carapace and opisthosoma are lighter. It resembles Acanthoscurria theraphosoides as the sexual organs are quite similar in structure, though it can be easily separated from it, as it owns a dark patch on the opisthosoma.
Habitat
They are mainly found n the Bolivian Rainforests, so I will be basing this section on the Carrasco National Park in Bolivia. The average temperatures of this area are 24ºC, with an average rainfall of 2,500mm. It can range from 280m to 4717m above sea level and is home to 638 species of vertebrates.
Behavior
It is terrestrial in nature, and a very docile tarantula, with mild venom. They are surprisingly non-skittish, and will not commonly throw urticating hairs. They are primarily nocturnal, and will dig tubular burrows, reaching from 10cm to 20cm in dept.

Vanessa Isabelle Vandy (born 14 May 1989) is a New Zealand-born Finnish film director, cinematographer and former pole vaulter. She is a national outdoor and indoor champion for the pole vault, and also, a bronze medalist at the 2009 European Athletics Under-23 Championships in Kaunas, Lithuania.
Film career
Vandy is currently working as a film director and cinematographer. Her style lies in her ability to move people, to capture their attention and to evoke an emotion. Her first short film, Farewell, was selected as a finalist in One Screen 2017 Film Festival's Free The Bid - new female director category.
Athletic career
Born in Auckland to a New Zealand father and Finnish mother, Vandy holds a dual citizenship, and chose to represent her mother's birthplace Finland at numerous sporting events, including the Olympic games. At age ten, Vandy moved with her family to Vaasa, Finland, where she began pole vaulting at age 13. She eventually became a member of, and trained full-time at Vasa Idrottssällskap, under her personal and head coach Johan Westö.
In 2007, Vandy made her international debut at the European Junior Championships, where she achieved a seventh-place finish in the women's pole vault. She also set her personal best of 4.15 metres by winning the bronze medal at the Finnish Elite Series in Lahti, ahead of her teammate Minna Nikkanen, who flew over 4.05 metres. Shortly after the series, she continued to beat Nikkanen at the Sweden-match in Gothenburg, and most importantly, at the Finnish Indoor Championships in Joensuu, where she claimed her first ever career title in the pole vault.
The following year, Vandy reached her breakthrough season by vaulting her personal best of 4.31 metres at an athletics meet in Sopot, Poland. She also finished sixth at the 2008 IAAF World Junior Championships in Bydgoszcz, and won her second career title at the national outdoor championships in Tampere, which gave her a qualifying berth for the Olympics.
At the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, Vandy successfully cleared a height of 4.00 metres in the women's pole vault, an event which was later dominated by world-record holder Yelena Isinbayeva of Russia. Vandy, however, failed to advance into the final, as she placed thirty-second overall in the qualifying rounds, tying her position with Tunisia's Leila Ben Youssef.
In 2009, Vandy extended her personal best of 4.36 metres by finishing second at the Elite World Championships in Lapua, behind her teammate Minna Nikkanen. She also won the bronze medal at the European Athletics Under-23 Championships in Kaunas, Lithuania, with a satisfying height of 4.35 metres.
In early 2011, Vandy announced her retirement from pole vault to focus on and pursue her career in filmmaking, having suffered knee problems for the past few years.

A video-ready access device (VRAD) provides digital subscriber line access and high-definition television programming to customers subscribed to IPTV services such as AT&T's U-verse, Bell Canada's Bell Fibe TV, Claro Puerto Rico's Claro TV, and Telus's Optik TV. VRAD equipment manufactured by Alcatel-Lucent can be configured to support between 48 and 864 lines per box. The VRAD boxes are composed of circuit boards providing service, fed by fiber-optic cable.
AT&T VRADs
There are 2 types of VRAD systems currently used by AT&T: FTTN (fiber to the node), and FTTP (fiber to the premises).
FTTN, widely used where copper facilities exist in established neighborhoods, uses an Alcatel-Lucent 7330 Intelligent Services Access Manager (ISAM) shelf, which uses the existing copper wiring to customers' homes, leading to distance limitations from the VRAD cabinet to the customer's home. The 7330 ISAM is an internet protocol DSL access multiplexer that supports VDSL and ADSL protocols.
The FTTP system uses an Alcatel-Lucent 7340 ISAM shelf, which is mostly used in areas such as new neighborhoods or large-scale developments where fiber can be run to the household, removing the distance limitations of copper. The 7340 then connects to a Primary Flexibility Point, which distributes service to homes in the neighborhood, via a dual strand fiber, which is then split into 32 customer fiber pairs. In FTTP systems, the fiber pairs are typically led into a customer's residence at the network interface device. In FTTD (fiber to the desk) systems, the fiber can continue to an equipment room or garage, then to a decoder box or residential gateway, then to the customer's TV, computer, and phone lines.
The VRAD typically connects upstream to an Alcatel-Lucent 7450 Ethernet service switch in the central office hub, then to the headend video hub office.
VRADs required for U-verse are around wide, tall, and deep. Size and graffiti risk have drawn complaints from homeowners. AT&T has sued competitor Comcast for Chicago ads against AT&T's "large and unsightly" VRADs. Four VRADs have exploded due to faulty lithium-ion batteries manufactured by Avestor (now bankrupt), at least one explosion sending parts "fifty feet throughout the neighborhood." AT&T replaced all 17,000 Avestor batteries used in its VRADs with safer Alcatel-Lucent-designed SAFT NiCad batteries, which have a 10-year life.
Other VRADs
Bell Canada's Bell Fibe TV and Telus's Optik TV also use VRADs in their networks. Bell Canada uses the Alcatel-Lucent 7330 and Ikanos Communications IKNS ISAMs, and provides Internet service via either FTTN to 50 Mbit/s, or FTTH (fibre to the home) to 1.5 Gbit/s.
Claro Puerto Rico is currently deploying VRADs to offer their IPTV and VDSL Internet service up to 50Mbit/s. There are 2 types of VRAD systems currently used by Claro: FTTN (fiber to the node), and FTTP (fiber to the premises). It is unknown the equipment they are using.

The Fairey Firefly was a British fighter of the 1920s from Fairey Aviation.
It was a single-seat, single-engine biplane of mixed construction.
Development
The Firefly was a private-venture design, penned by Marcel Lobelle. It was first flown on 9 November 1925 by Norman Macmillan.
The Air Ministry did not pursue the project, partly because of the American Curtiss engine used and partly because of its wooden construction and the Firefly I did not enter production.

Guy of Ibelin (French: Guy d'Ibelin) (1215/1218 – after May 1255) was marshal and constable of the kingdom of Cyprus. He was the fifth son of John of Ibelin, the Old Lord of Beirut, and of Melisende of Arsuf. He had close relations with the king of Cyprus, Henry I, acting as witness for two royal decrees; he was probably one of the king's executors named in a papal bull of Pope Alexander IV. With his brother Baldwin of Ibelin, he led the Cypriot crusaders in the siege of Damietta in 1248. According to the medieval chronicler Jean de Joinville, he was one of the most accomplished knights of his generation and a benevolent ruler on Cyprus. Joinville recounts an episode when he, Guy and Baldwin had been taken prisoner by Saracen rebels:
Guy married Phillipa Berlais, daughter of Aimery Berlais. Their children were:
Baudouin d'Ibelin, bailli of the kingdom of Jerusalem, then constable of the kingdom of Cyprus
Jean d'Ibelin, assassinated in 1277
Aimery d'Ibelin
Balian d'Ibelin (1240–1302), seneschal of Cyprus 1286-1302

The William Ministry (or the Ripperda Ministry) was a Spanish government which served between 12 December 1725 and 16 April 1726, headed by John William, Baron Ripperda, born a Dutchman.
The Ministry came to office following the surprise abdication of Philip V, who handed power to his eldest son Louis and political turmoil. The previous Chief Minister left office with him, and after some intermediaries had taken power, Ripperda was appointed to the office—which was also something of a shock as he was considered as an adventurer rather than a politician.
During his five-month tenure, much of his time was spent on foreign policy. The decision by France to break the promised engagement between the French King Louis XV and the Spanish Infanta was taken as a grave insult to Spain, and a potential weakening of her power. In response, Ripperda opened negotiations with Austria, a traditional enemy, to try to establish a new alliance, the end result of which was the Treaty of Vienna. In this, Ripperda was under heavy influence from Elisabeth Farnese, the recently abdicated king's wife and mother of the spurned child.
Following the death of the new Spanish king, Louis, after only seven months Phillip V had returned to the throne. Despite his support for Ripperda, the Chief Minister was very unpopular with ordinary Spaniards, and following a scandal concerning misappropriated money he was dismissed and forced to take refuge in the British Embassy, bringing his brief spell in the post to an inglorious end. He was later imprisoned in the Castle at Segovia. His government was replaced by the Third Grimaldo Ministry, led by the more established figure of José de Grimaldo

Politics of Spain
(d. July 30, 1621) was a Japanese noble woman and concubine of Tokugawa Ieyasu, the founder of the Tokugawa shogunate in Japan. She lived in Tōtōmi Province. She is said to be the daughter of a foundryman. When the daikan (a local official) had her husband killed, she appealed to Ieyasu, who was then the lord of Hamamatsu Castle; as a result, he punished the daikan. Lady Chaa subsequently became a concubine of Ieyasu. She was also the mother of Matsudaira Tadateru and Matsudaira Matsuchiyo. An account cited that Lady Chaa was part of Osaka Castle's Genji circle and received a copy of Genji monogatari no okori from her aunt, Keifukuin Kaoku Gyokuei.
Like other women of the Tokugawa clan, Lady Chaa was actively involved in politics, participating in councils and using her influence to protect and resolve conflicts between the temples. Lady Chaa's grave is at Sōkei-ji, a Buddhist temple in Bunkyō, Tokyo. Her Buddhist name is Satoru'in
Early life
Lady Chaa was the daughter of Yamada Hachizaemon of the Yamada clan, a local samurai family who governed the area around the village of Kanaya in Tōtōmi Province. There is a legend that, in her childhood, she learned calligraphy under the abbot of the Tōzen Temple and, in her later years, out of gratitude toward her master, she donated a bell​ to the temple. Prior to becoming a consort of Ieyasu, she married into and then separated from the Hanai clan whereupon she was adopted by the Kawamura, a more powerful samurai family.
After becoming the second wife of an individual engaged in metal casting, Lady Chaa bore a daughter named Oba. However, owing to her beauty, she became the target of a magistrate who turned into a homewrecker, killing her husband under darkness of night. As Lady Chaa took her three-year-old daughter (Oba) to seek revenge for the slaying, she encountered Ieyasu and his detail on a falconry outing, whereupon she appealed directly to Ieyasu for help. The magistrate was executed as punishment but then, in a manner similar to an abduction, Ieyasu took Lady Chaa and her daughter back to Hamamatsu Castle and had her serve as his consort, giving her the name of Chaa-no-tsubone. Meanwhile, Hasegawa Hachirōemon exacted revenge against the magistrate through execution.
In Tokugawa clan
In 1592, Chaa-no-tsubone gave birth to Tatsuchiyo (later known as Matsudaira Tadateru) and, in 1594, to Matsuchiyo. However, Ieyasu did not treat Tatsuchiyo well. Soon after the birth of his younger brother, Matsuchiyo, Ieyasu arranged for Matsuchiyo to inherit the Nagasawa-Matsudaira family and made him the head of the Fukaya domain with a fief of 10,000 koku. In 1599, Matsuchiyo, however, died early at the age of six so Tatsuchiyo succeeded him as head of the domain. In 1602, Tatsuchiyo attended his coming-of-age ceremony and adopted the name of Tadateru. In 1603, the Fukaya domain was abolished and he was granted a fief of 140,000 koku in Kawanakajima in Shinano Province. Chaa-no-tsubone then arranged for the two sons (of a different mother) from her deceased husband (Zenhachirō and Matahachirō) to be adopted by Kimata Keihō, a member of the family of Hasegawa Hachirōemon and become servants of Tadateru. Meanwhile, her son-in-law, Hanai Yoshinari, became the chief retainer of Tadateru. Later, this invited conflict with long-serving retainers such as Matsudaira Kiyonao and Yamada Katsushige.
Owing to her intelligence and sensibility, Chaa-no-tsubone was delegated tasks in the inner part of Ieyasu's residence. She was known for her strong opinion and political prowess. She endeavored to protect the temples in the environs of her hometown of Kanaya as well as to resolve disputes between the temples. Her younger brother remained busy serving as the abbot at the Nōman Temple and managing temple lands.
Her older brother, Yamada Kōzuke-no-suke, served Ishida Mitsunari and became a senior retainer. Just days after the Battle of Sekigahara, in 1600, Sawayama Castle was toppled. Kōzuke-no-suke, along with Mitsunari's father (Ishida Masatsugu) and older brother (Ishida Masazumi), killed themselves. Before their demise, however, they enabled the escape of Kōzuke-no-suke's son, Yamada Hayato-no-shō, to Chaa-no-tsubnoe through a relative named Kōzōsu. He later adopted the name of Yamada Katsushige and married the eldest daughter of Mitsunari. Meanwhile, Chaa-no-tsubone arranged for Katsushige to become the chief retainer of her son, Tadateru.
In 1606, Tadateru wed the eldest daughter (Irohahime) of Date Masamune as his formal wife. Thereafter, his fief steadily increased so that he controlled 750,000 koku in Takada in Echigo Province. In 1616, after the death of Ieyasu, Chaa-no-tsubone underwent the rites of tonsure and adopted the name of Satoru-in (朝覚院). However, soon thereafter, Tadateru was criticized by his older brother, Hidetada, on numerous occasions for mistakes, resulting in removal from his position and, as punishment, exile to Ise Province. Chaa-no-tsubone made every effort to obtain the assistance of a consort of Ieyasu named Acha-no-tsubone (Unkōin), but the help was not forthcoming. The diary of Captain Richard Cocks, the head of the England Chamber of Commerce in Hirado, notes that, following removal from his position, Tadateru stayed at the home of his uncle in Kanaya on his way to exile in Ise Province.
Chaa-no-tsubone died of illness in the sixth month of 1621 and was interred at the Sōkei Temple in Edo.

International Whisk(e)y Day was first announced in 2008 and falls on 27 March each year. The name is used with the parenthesis to indicate support of Scottish, Canadian, and Japanese whiskies (no e) as well as Irish and American whiskeys (with an e). The day publicly supports Parkinson's disease research in addition to enjoying Whiskey.
Founding
International Whiskey Day was launched in 2009 at the Whiskey Day Festival in the northern Netherlands in the presence of several whiskey writers. The event was created in honor of British writer Michael Jackson and is celebrated on Jackson's birthday.
Participation
Participants are encouraged to raise one up on the day and drink whiskey for the love of the drink as well as to celebrate Michael's life. Others participate via social media using the #whiskyday2015 hashtag. Various bars may have specials on 27 March to celebrate the day.
Taken from the International Whisk(e)y day's website, "International Whisk(e)y Day is a non-profit celebration of whiskey which receives no funding and is run entirely by the passion of whiskey fans from around the world. So if you love whisk(e)y and want to help spread the word, then go ahead and tell someone about it."
Other Whiskey Days
International Whisk(e)y Day is not to be confused with World Whisky Day or National Bourbon Day which fall in May and June respectively.
There is some conflict with World Whiskey Day where International Whisk(e)y day claims to be the original. This conflict only really exists because WWD is the more well known date in the United States and IWD organizers do not want to be seen as the copycat since they were founded four years earlier. There is also a conflict because each group uses similar hashtags which is not obvious to most people which is which. However, the dates of each event are on separate days in separate months.
There is not as much of a conflict with National Bourbon Day because it specifically celebrates America's "Native Spirit" and not, generically, all whiskeys.

Maxime Latour (born April 12, 1993) is a professional Canadian football long snapper for the Toronto Argonauts of the Canadian Football League (CFL).
University career
Latour played U Sports football for the Sherbrooke Vert et Or from 2014 to 2017. He played in 28 regular season games in four seasons for the Vert et Or as the team's long snapper.
Professional career
Montreal Alouettes
Latour was eligible for the 2018 CFL Draft, but was not selected in the draft. He was then signed on September 26, 2018, by the Montreal Alouettes as an undrafted free agent to the team's practice roster. He was released on October 31, 2018, just prior to the last game of the regular season, but was re-signed by the Alouettes to a one-year contract on December 12, 2018. Latour spent training camp with the Alouettes in 2019, but was released with the final cuts on June 9, 2019.
Winnipeg Blue Bombers
On September 4, 2019, Latour was signed by the Winnipeg Blue Bombers to a practice roster agreement following an injury to the team's incumbent long snapper, Chad Rempel. Soon after, he made his professional debut on September 7, 2019, in the Banjo Bowl against the Saskatchewan Roughriders. Rempel returned for the next game and Latour was added back to the practice roster. With Rempel injured toward the end of the regular season, Latour was again pressed into action and played in the last two games of the regular season. He then made his post-season debut on November 10, 2021, against the Calgary Stampeders, but suffered a back injury in the game. This coincided with Rempel's return from the injured reserve, so Latour switched places and went to the injured list himself. Two weeks later, the Blue Bombers won the 107th Grey Cup over the Hamilton Tiger-Cats and Latour won the first Grey Cup championship of his career.
Due to the cancellation of the 2020 CFL season, Latour did not play in 2020. His contract expired on February 9, 2021, and he became a free agent.
Ottawa Redblacks
On September 13, 2021, it was announced that Latour had signed with the Ottawa Redblacks. He was then transferred to the team's practice roster and did not play in a game for the team.
Toronto Argonauts
After the Toronto Argonauts' long snapper, Jake Reinhart, suffered a severe injury, Latour was claimed by the team from the Redblacks' practice roster on October 7, 2021. He played in the six remaining regular season games for the team and the East Final.
Ottawa Redblacks (II)
After the Argonauts' season ended with an East Final loss, Latour's playing rights reverted back to the Ottawa Redblacks on December 6, 2021. He became a free agent upon the expiry of his contract on February 8, 2022.
Toronto Argonauts (II)
On August 9, 2022, Latour re-signed with the Toronto Argonauts.
Personal life
During the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, Latour started a farming business in Orford, Quebec with his friend, Nicolas Boulay.

Psychophony (from the Greek psyke, soul and phone, sound, voice) is the name given by Spiritism and some other spiritualist traditions to the phenomenon where, according to them, a spirit talks using the voice of a medium.
Spiritist Doctrine as codified by Allan Kardec identifies two main classes of psychophony, to say, the "conscious" one and the "unconscious" one. The first one, as its name says, happens when the medium assures that he has mentally perceived or physically heard something that a spirit said, having only used his voice to reproduce it. The second one occurs when the medium assures that he ignores what was said, suggesting that a spirit used his phonetic organs while he was unconscious. As happens with all sorts of classification, this one is useful only for didactic purposes. Most psychophony occurrences are neither 100% conscious nor 100% unconscious laying somewhere between the two classes.
In The Book on Mediums, Allan Kardec calls unconscious psychophonic mediums "speaking mediums".
In 1971, Konstantin Raudive wrote Breakthrough, detailing what he believed was the discovery of electronic voice phenomenon (EVP). EVP, however, has been described as auditory pareidolia.

The Hofgartenkaserne, also known as Infanterie-Leibregiment-Kaserne or Max-Joseph-Kaserne, was a military facility of the Bavarian army, located at Hofgarten Strasse 2 in Munich, Germany. The construction was planned and realized by the war economy councillor Direktorialrat Joseph Frey from 1801 to 1807.
History
Because the existing barracks of the Munich garrison had an unfavourable tactical location, and some of them fell into disrepair, Maximilian I Joseph of Bavaria decided to build the new kaserne at the northern outskirts of old Munich in the eastern Hofgarten, and a smaller one nearby, the Seidenhauskaserne.
Originally the Hofgartenkaserne, which was conceived for 1.800 people, should be built on the fundament of the old silk factory covering the city ditch at the eastern border of the Hofgarten. The large pond of the Hofgarten should be filled up for the later barrack yard. But in consequence of the millers' protests, who needed the ditch for their mill wheels, the foundation stone was laid more westwards over the quickly filled up pond in 1801. At first the 1st Lines Lifeguards Regiment moved into the four-storied building in 1804, but it was not completed until 1807. The total costs of construction were 256.629 Gulden. On the occasion of completion, in 1801 the Bavarian medailleur and punchcutter Cajetan Destouches (C.D.; born 1769 – died 1833 in Munich) edited a medal in honor of Maximilian I Joseph.
The Hofgartenkaserne was never fully occupied. The conditions inside the building soon turned out to be unhealthy. It was assumed, that the subsoil below the building was too boggy because the filled-up pond was not drained enough before its construction. The inhabitants suffered consistently from illness, and the cases of typhoid were also considered as a result. Due to the epidemic in the Hofgarten- and the Seidenhauskaserne in 1893, when 34 lifeguards died and 8 became invalid, a meeting of scientists, physicians, military, engineers and representatives of the city was scheduled to clarify the reasons. Chairman of the meeting was the Bavarian minister of war Adolph von Asch. Due to a missing uniform conclusion, von Asch decided to apply for closing the barracks at the prince regent, who accepted the motion on July 18, 1893. The Hofgartenkaserne was fully evacuated in the end of the same year, the Lehel-Kaserne and the Seidenhauskaserne a view years later. After the army's plan to sell the building was jettisoned in 1898, the building slated for demolition in 1899 to make way for an army museum.
The Bavarian Army Museum, which was built a few steps more westwards on a new fundament after 1901, was opened in 1905 and existed until the end of World War II. The building remained in ruins. The central dome building was rebuilt and is the central part of today's Bavarian Staatskanzlei's building ("State Chancellery"), which was completed in 1993.

Chath Piersath, born in Kop Nymit, Svay Sisophon District, in Battambang Province, is a noted Cambodian American poet, painter and humanitarian. He creates both large and small portraits of people from his memory, often representing the social and economic disparity among Cambodians.
Chath pierSath crossed the Thai-Cambodian border in 1979 at the end of the Khmer Rouge period with members of his family to Aranyaprathet Refugee Camp. With the aid of his aunt, he, his older brother and sister emigrated to the United States in 1981 and lived first in Boulder, Colorado. He graduated from World College West/New College of California, majoring in international service and development.
Much of his poetry deals with his macabre memories of the Khmer Rouge atrocities and the massacres of the Killing Fields; his poem "A Letter to My Mother" was published by the Yale University Press in 1997.

Johann Wilhelm Michaelsen (9 October 1860, Hamburg - 18 February 1937) was a German zoologist who was a world authority on the Oligochaeta which includes the earthworms. He named and described more than a thousand new species.
Michaelsen was born to Friedrich Rudolph and Johanna Catharina Ferdinandine née Köhn. In 1887 he commenced work at the Hamburg Zoological Museum, at first as a research assistant. He was later to become Hauptkustos (chief curator). Alfred Lothar Wegener (1880-1930) was a friend of Michaelsen and made use of his biogeographical work for some of his ideas on plate tectonics. Michaelsen named a species of earthworm after him as Wegeneriella Michaelsen, 1933. He also collaborated with John Stephenson.
Though he also worked in the study of Tunicates and Polychaetes, Michaelsen was best known for his work on Oligochaeta. To that end, he travelled to southern regions of South America, Africa and Australia to investigate the fossil records of ancient Oligochaete distribution.
Michaelsen was married to Agnes Huwald and they had no children.
Michaelsen is commemorated in the scientific name of a species of lizard, Strophurus michaelseni.

Noël Bernard (born 'Noel Bercovici'; 25 February 1925 – 23 December 1981) was a Romanian journalist, known for being the head of the Romanian-language department of Radio Free Europe (RFE). His mysterious death is believed by some to have been caused by Communist Romania's secret police, the Securitate, which is known to have previously sought his neutralisation.
Biography
Born in Bucharest, to a Jewish father and a German Evangelical mother, Noël Bernard left Romania together with his parents, and moved to Mandatory Palestine in 1940. There, he studied mathematics at Hebrew University of Jerusalem where he met his first wife, fellow student Yvette Bourla. He then moved to London, where he changed his name to Bernard and became a journalist at the BBC, working in the organisation's Romanian service.
Bernard started working as the chief of the Romanian language department of the West German-based Radio Free Europe in 1953, but he left in 1958 and moved to Rome with his wife and two children. After reporting from Rome, he and his family returned to England, where Bernard ran the London office of Radio Press International (RPI), a radio news service that was ultimately bought out by UPI. Eight years after leaving Munich, Bernard returned to serve as director of RFE's Romanian-language department until his death in 1981. In 1972, he married Ioana Măgură. A former newsreader for the Romanian Radio and Television (1964–1969), she had defected from Communist Romania in 1969, and had started working for RFE in Munich.
Under his leadership, the Romanian-language department of Radio Free Europe became the most popular of all the languages it broadcast. After the 1977 Bucharest earthquake, Bernard obtained permission from the radio board to transmit around-the-clock information in Romanian. According to Arch Puddington in Broadcasting Freedom. The Cold War Triumph of Radio Free Europe and Radio Liberty, under Bernard's leadership "the Romanian section carried out a relentless polemical offensive against Ceaușescu [...] The tone was biting, personal and sarcastic. During Bernard's editorship, the Romanian section was not infrequently cited for violation of the station's strictures against vituperation and rhetorical excess."
The Securitate tried to start disputes within the Romanian-language department of RFE and to create a hostile environment against Bernard, to remove him from the head of the radio station.
Ion Mihai Pacepa, the Romanian intelligence general who defected to the United States, claimed that he decided to defect after Communist President Nicolae Ceaușescu ordered him to assassinate Bernard. In his book, Red Horizons, Pacepa claimed that Bernard was Ceaușescu's bête noire because of his strong criticism of Ceaușescu's personality cult.
Bernard died of cancer. His wife, Ioana Măgură-Bernard, moved to California, to join her daughter and grandchildren. In various statements for the Romanian press, she suggests that her late husband was irradiated by the Securitate, which had previously infiltrated the RFE's structure. She also linked Bernard's death to those of RFE journalists such as Cornel Chiriac (who was stabbed to death in mysterious circumstances), Emil Georgescu and Vlad Georgescu (both of whom, like Bernard and others in quick succession, died of cancer). This hypothesis appears to be supported by his Securitate file, which has attached an article from a magazine which talks about him undergoing surgery and has a note which argues that the article confirms "the measures undertaken by us are starting to have an effect".

Fergal P. McCusker is a Gaelic footballer who played for the Derry county team in the 1980s, 1990s and early 2000s. He played club football with Watty Graham's GAC Glen until retiring in 2007.
McCusker was part of Derry's 1993 All-Ireland Championship winning side, as well as the 1993 and 1998 Ulster Championship winning teams. He earned a reputation for his ability to play in either defence or attack.
Personal life
McCusker was born in Maghera and attended St Patrick's College there. His brother Damien was also in the 1993 Derry team that won the All-Ireland. He works as a bank official and also writes a column for the County Derry Post newspaper. In 2007, he lodged a motion at the Derry GAA convention to rename Derry's training complex Owenbeg, to the Eamonn Coleman Centre of Excellence in honour of legendary Derry GAA figure Eamonn Coleman.
Although a founding member of the Gaelic Players Association (GPA) even coining the organisation's name, McCusker has renounced his membership and in a December 2007 meeting in Newbridge, McCusker publicly spoke out against the direction the organisation had taken in over the recent players' grants issue. On one occasion, he almost came to blows with a Newbridge aficionado who voiced his disapproval of the GPA, McCusker wasn't available to comment at the time and the issue has since died.
Inter-county career
Regarded as one of the best Derry minor players of all time, McCusker was called up at age 17 to the Derry's senior team during the 1988 National Football League by then manager Tom Scullion. McCusker made his Derry senior debut that year against Armagh and scored a goal in that match to save Derry from relegation. He was part of Derry's 1993 Ulster Championship and All-Ireland winning team, which defeated Cork in the final.
McCusker added a second Ulster Championship medal in 1998. He won National Football League medals with Derry in 1992, 1995, 1996 and 2000??, and retired from inter-county football in 2000. McCusker and Derry finished runners-up to Offaly in the 1998 National League decider.
In September 2008 McCusker was appointed part of a special selection committee set up by the Derry County Board, to interview the candidates for the vacant Derry Senior, Under 21 and Minor managers' positions in both football and hurling. Following the committee's recommendations, Damian Cassidy was formally ratified as new Derry Senior football manager at the county board meeting on 7 October.

The Military Courts of Kyrgyzstan (Kyrgyz: Кыргызстандын Аскердик соттор; Russian: Военные суды Кыргызстана) are courts that deal with criminal cases concerning military personnel. Most courts are located in military garrisons all over the country and have jurisdiction over all criminal cases about crimes committed by servicemen. There is no mention of military courts in the Constitution of Kyrgyzstan and organizations such as Crisis Group Asia argues that there has been some discussion of abolishing these courts and transferring their duties to local courts. In December 2016, President Almazbek Atambayev signed a decree officially abolishing the use of military courts. This was done due to a recommendation made by the Commission for the Reform of the Judicial System, which said that the state budget couldn't fund them anymore.

His father was an Edinburgh-trained physician, botanist, and medical translator from Geneva, who was friends with Louis Odier, the Swiss physician, medical translator and publisher. After working in Geneva, the family moved to Paris where de La Roche senior was physician to the Duke of Orléans, and later at the :fr:Rue du Faubourg-Saint-Martin health centre.
Career
De La Roche studied at the Faculty of Medicine at the University of Paris where, in 1806, he completed his medical thesis on the effects of strong heat on animal husbandry. He became a physician at L'Hôpital Necker.
He collected and studied fish on an expedition to the Spanish Balearic islands between October 1807 and May 1808; he observed and described new or little-known species from that location and made a study of the swim bladders of fish.
In 1811, he carried out work on the Specific Heat of Gases in collaboration with the French physicist and chemist Jacques Étienne Bérard, work which won a prize from the Paris Academy of Science in 1812. Also in 1812, he read a paper at the Institut de France titled Dissertation on the effect that air temperature has on the phenomenon of respiration.
As an original researcher, his name is attached (as de La Roche or Delaroche) to the plant genus Alepidea and a number of different marine species.
Death
De La Roche became infected with typhus bacteria and died in 1813, only just aged 32, during the same epidemic that his father also succumbed to. Both were interred in the family grave in the 25th division of Père-Lachaise Cemetery in Paris.

Thomas Lincoln Casey Jr. (February 19, 1857 – February 6, 1925) was an American army engineer and entomologist who was noted for his work on Coleoptera. He was the eldest son of Brigadier General Thomas Lincoln Casey (1831–1896), who served as Chief of Engineers for the United States Army Corps of Engineers and oversaw the completion of the Washington Monument.
Military career
Casey was born in West Point, New York. He followed in his father's footsteps and attended the United States Military Academy at West Point. He entered the Academy in 1875 and graduated second in his class in 1879, when he was commissioned a 2nd lieutenant in the Corps of Engineers.
He was promoted to 1st lieutenant in June 1881 and to captain in July 1888. From 1895 he was assigned to construction of fortifications at Fort Monroe and the Hampton Roads area in Virginia. In July 1898, he was promoted to major and supervised the installation of underwater mines to defend Hampton Roads during the Spanish–American War. He then served at Vicksburg, Mississippi from 1899 to 1901 and was in charge of Mississippi river improvements at St. Louis, Missouri from 1901 to 1906.
In 1906, he was promoted to lieutenant colonel. In 1909, he was promoted to colonel and assigned as engineer secretary to the Lighthouse Board until 1910. Casey retired from the army on November 1, 1912.
Scientific work
He published numerous scientific papers on the subject of Coleoptera and a monograph, Memoirs on the Coleoptera (1910–1924). He was also known for contributions to astronomy.

This is a list of electricity-generating power stations in Michigan, sorted by type and name. In 2019, Michigan had a total summer capacity of 29,457 MW through all of its power plants, and a net generation of 116,701 GWh. The corresponding energy mix was 32.5% coal, 30.8% natural gas, 28.0% nuclear, 5.0% wind, 2.1% biomass, 1.4% hydroelectric, 0.1% solar, and 0.1% petroleum. Coal use has decreased by half over the last decade, replaced by natural gas and renewables. 60% of renewable generation is wind energy.
Michigan imports all coal and nuclear fuel (uranium), and 82% of natural gas. A goal to produce over 10% of electricity from in-state renewable sources was set in 2015. Major electric companies in Michigan include Detroit Edison (11,000 MW) and Consumers Power (9,000 MW).
Nuclear power stations
Nuclear power is a significant source of electrical power in Michigan, producing roughly one-quarter of the state's supply. The two active nuclear power plants supply Michigan less than 30% of its electricity.
Former nuclear power stations
See also Midland Cogeneration Venture, a plant abandoned before completion
Coal power stations
Coal power is the leading source of electricity in Michigan. Although Michigan has no active coal mines, coal is easily moved from other states by train and across the Great Lakes by lake freighters. The lower price of natural gas is leading to the closure of most coal plants with Consumer Energy planning to close all of its remaining coal plants by 2025 while DTE plans to retire 2100MW of coal power by 2023.
Former coal plants
Natural gas power stations
Michigan has some of its own natural gas production and is a leading state for natural gas transport and storage. Declining prices for natural gas in the early 21st century led to an increase in the number of natural gas power plants. Consumers Power announced a new 700 MW plant to be built near Flint beginning about 2015 while the city of Holland replaced its coal plant with a 114 MW natural gas plant In April 2018, DTE received permission for a 1,100 MW natural gas plant to replace a coal plant in St. Clair.
Oil power stations
Fuel oils and other liquid fuels are only a minor fuel used in Michigan for power generation. Some units burn liquid fuel only while some multiple fuel units sometimes use liquid fuels as well.
Former plants
Multiple fuel
Multiple fuel units may alter their fuel source depending on balance pricing, availability, and energy content.
Municipal solid waste
Waste to energy plants which use garbage to produce power are a minor source of Michigan's electricity.
Former plants:
Landfill gas
Landfill gas plants, which use methane collected from garbage dumps to power electrical generators, are in use near a number of Michigan landfills but are only a minor source of power.
Only plants larger than 4 MW
Former plants:
Biomass/waste power plants
Biomass power plants in Michigan often use waste from the lumber industry. Smaller units use food waste, or cow, pig and turkey waste.
Retired
Hydropower
Michigan has a number of small hydropower plants; however, the generally small, flat rivers provide a limited source of power.
Pumped storage hydropower power stations
Michigan has one pumped-storage hydroelectricity station, on the shore of Lake Michigan, used for power balancing. It is the fifth largest such plant in the world.
Wind power stations
Wind power in Michigan grew rapidly due to national price supports and a Michigan mandate to produce 10% renewable energy by 2015. The largest concentration of wind power is in the Thumb region.
As of February 2022
Solar power stations
Solar power is a very minor source of electricity in Michigan.
Systems of over 2.0 MW, as of March 2022

Mollie Ziegler Hemingway (born c. 1974) is an American conservative author, columnist, and political commentator. She is the editor-in-chief of the online magazine The Federalist and a contributor for Fox News.
Initially a harsh critic of Donald Trump during the 2016 Republican primary, Hemingway has since become a vocal supporter of Trump and has claimed the 2020 election was rigged.
Early life and education
Mollie Ziegler was born in Denver, Colorado. Her father is a retired pastor of the Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod and her mother is a retired schoolteacher. She earned a degree in economics from the University of Colorado Denver.
Political and other commentary
In 2002, she moved to Gannett Publishing, where she worked at the Federal Times.
Hemingway has written columns in publications such as the Wall Street Journal, National Review, The New York Times Magazine, and Ricochet. She was one of the founding members of The Federalist. She has appeared multiple times on C-SPAN. In 2017, she became a Fox News contributor. Her columns have been published in USA Today, The Los Angeles Times, The Guardian, The Washington Post, CNN, and RealClearPolitics.
Views
Early in the 2016 presidential campaign, she described then-candidate Donald Trump as "a demagogue with no real solutions for anything at all." However, since then, she has been described as pro-Trump, with Politico describing her as "a reliably pro-Trump commentator", while Salon called her The Federalist'''s "most reliable Trump defender". The New York Times wrote in 2020 that Hemingway's columns "have earned presidential retweets and affirmation for their scathing criticism of Democrats and the news media, whom she accuses of lying about just about everything when it comes to the president."
In May 2017, Hemingway defended Trump's decision to fire FBI Director James Comey. In July 2017, after Comey testified to Congress, Hemingway questioned Comey's character, saying "this is not a choir boy here. [Comey] could teach masterclasses in how to cover your own behind and engage in typical Washington, DC shenanigans."
In February 2018, she argued that Carter Page, a former Trump campaign advisor who had been subjected to intelligence surveillance since 2014, had his civil liberties violated. Hemingway stated, "if the civil rights and civil liberties of Carter Page can be violated, they can be violated for anyone." Page, who had relationships with numerous Russian citizens and held pro-Putin views, had been the subject of attempted recruitment by Russian intelligence since 2013. In April 2019, the Mueller Report revealed that investigators found no direct evidence that Page coordinated Trump campaign activities with the Russian government.
In May 2018, Trump tweeted a quote attributed to Hemingway which gave credence to a conspiracy theory initiated by Trump in May 2018 that the Obama administration had placed a spy in his 2016 presidential campaign for political purposes, and stated that the surveillance was "unprecedented and scandalous." Vox countered statements such as Hemingway's, stating that while an FBI informant did meet with several Trump campaign advisers, the FBI didn't actually intend to spy on Trump, but was instead "most likely part of a legitimate counterintelligence operation targeted at Russia's election interference campaign..."
In November 2018, Hemingway described Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election as "a very Stalinist-type approach to criminal justice."
In a November 2019, Hemingway named the alleged whistleblower who exposed the Trump-Ukraine scandal. The Daily Beast wrote that naming the whistleblower "seemingly break[s] the network's policy of identifying the person."
In June 2020, she accused the media of fabricating reports that law enforcement used tear gas and excessive force against peaceful protestors to clear a path for Trump to stage a photo op in front of St. John's Church. Law enforcement later acknowledged that it did in fact shoot pepper-based irritants into the crowd.
Following the 2021 United States Capitol attack, Hemingway pushed the disproven claim that the attack was unarmed, claiming a "lack of actual arms that were used" despite evidence that offenders carried handguns as well as other weapons including knives, bombs, and bear spray. She has also disputed its status as an insurrection, tweeting that "people who call the few-hour riot at the Capitol by unarmed protesters an 'insurrection' are bad people who are harming the country."
In January 2022, Hemingway claimed the Democrats had rigged the 2020 election.
Reception Washington Post columnist Dana Milbank criticized conservative panelists, including Hemingway, for concluding in a discussion that marriage is good for women.
In 2016, New York Times writer Ana Marie Cox characterized Hemingway as "no fan of Donald Trump", despite writing for conservative publication The Federalist. Cox characterized Hemingway as surprisingly open on issues of marriage and sexuality for a conservative Christian, saying she "sound[s] a little bit like a feminist in talking about sex..."
Charlotte Hays of the Independent Women's Forum described her as "a lightning rod in the debates about feminism and religious liberty" and, "a big deal in conservative-leaning intellectual circles of the nation's capital."
Jonathan Chait of New York Magazine has said that Hemingway's work is becoming increasingly reactionary during the Trump era, adding that she has joined a cadre of conservatives whose "increasingly right-wing character has been mixed with a conviction that Democratic elections are inherently fraudulent, and that extra-legal processes can be justified as countermeasures".
Books
Hemingway has written three books:
Trump vs. the Media (Encounter Broadsides Book 51) (2017 Encounter Books)
Justice on Trial: The Kavanaugh Confirmation and the Future of the Supreme Court with Carrie Severino (2019 Regnery Publishing)
Rigged: How the Media, Big Tech, and the Democrats Seized Our Elections (2021 Regnery Publishing) ,
and has contributed to four other books, Dual Citizens: Politics and American Evangelicalism, The Seven Deadly Virtues: 18 Conservative Writers on Why the Virtuous Life is Funny as Hell, The Christmas Virtues: A Treasury of Conservative Tales for the Holidays, and Conservative Christmas Quotables, as well as authoring the pamphlet, Imprimis - September 2017 - Russian Collusion?.
Personal life
Mollie Hemingway is married to Mark Hemingway.

The Battle of Lemo was fought during the Finnish War between Sweden and Russia on 19–20 June 1808 (Julian calendar 7–8 June).
On 19 June, about 2,500 Swedes landed at Lemo (Finnish:Lemu) in Kaarina in Southwest Finland, aided by the Swedish Navy. There, the Swedes intended to liberate Åbo (Finnish:Turku) from the Russians. The Swedish landing forces were commanded by Major General Eberhard von Vegesack. The Russian had about 3,600 men in the area under the command of Lieutenant General Karl Gustav von Baggovut.
Battle forces
Swedish
Russian
Overview
Major General von Vegesack started immediately to entrench the landing site. The main defense line was set along the terrain facing the open field. The guns deployed to the front of Ala-Lemo Manor house. The gunboats that escorted the landing fleet were positioned at the strait so that they closed the strait and had a view to the battlefield. The Russian troops were deployed in small units along the Turku-Vyborg main road.
Phase 1 (Sunday 19 June)
The initial phases of the operation were quite successful for the Swedes, who managed to advance several kilometers and eventually have Turku in sight. However, the units of the Libau Infantry Regiment with one gun launched the first Russian counterattack and they pushed the advanced Swedish troops back to the main defense line. Von Vegesack attacked immediately to the Russian center.
The Russian commander Baggovut received reinforcements and he attacked with divided forces; 2 companies attacked on the right, 2 companies on the left, and 2 companies with the gun in the center. Lieutenant von Vegesack (the son of the general) found the Russian left flank open and attacked immediately. The Russians had to withdraw a few kilometers in defense. The Swedish troops followed.
Phase 2 (Monday 20 June)
Major General Nikolay Borozdin collected more reinforcements: 300 men from the Brest Infantry Regiment, two more guns, and one squadron of the Finland Dragoon Regiment. In the early morning the Libau Infantry Regiment made the Swedish troops retreat again back to the main defense line. Von Vegesack ordered all of the men from the nearby islands to the Lemo battlefield and strengthened the defense line.
Baggovut received the Pernov (Pärnu) Musketeer Regiment as additional reinforcement. The Russian launched the whole front attack with bayonets; the Pernov Regiment on the right, the Libau Regiment in the center, and the Brest Regiment on the left. The Russian artillery set fire to the Ala-Lemo Manor house. The Swedes were forced to pull back and eventually evacuate to their ships. The fortifications at the shore and later the gunboats defended the fleeing Swedes. The Russian artillery moved to the shore and fired at the Swedish fleet. Von Vegesack pulled both the land and sea forces back to the Åland Islands.
After the battle the Russian reserve forces at Yli-Lemo were 2 companies from the Nevski Regiment and ½ squadron of the Finland Dragoon Regiment.
Legacy
In the summer of 2008 the monument ("Dying soldier") by the sculptor Heidi Limnell was erected near the Yli-Lemo Manor house in memory of all soldiers killed in the battle of Lemo. The monument was inspired by The Tales of Ensign Stål, part: .

Efraín Jara Idrovo (Cuenca, 26 February 1926 – Cuenca, 8 April 2018) was an Ecuadorian writer and poet.
Efraín Jara Idrovo was born into a wealthy family. His father, Salvador Jara Bermeo, was a merchant who exported straw hats and his mother, Idrovo Leticia Aguilar, was a professor of Castilian and a poet. It was his mother who taught him poetry early on in his life.
He was awarded Ecuador's National Prize in Literature "Premio Eugenio Espejo" by the President of Ecuador in 1999.
Poems
Idrovo began writing poetry later than most poets do. He was trained in philosophy, having done a Bachelor of Philosophy degree. He lived for a while in the Galapagos Islands, where he was editor of The Macaw magazine. In his country, he edited the magazine published by the House of Ecuadorian Culture. His first anthology of poems was Inconsolable Charter, published in 1946. Several poetry books followed, including Transit in The Ash (1947), The Absence Trail (1948), Two Poems (1973), and the remarkable and hugely popular Weeping for Pedro Jara (1978). Idrovo was a prolific poet, and brought out many books into the nineties, like From the Superficial to Deep (1992), The Faces of Eros (1997) and The Evidence World'' (1999).
Weeping for Pedro Jara (structures for An Elegy)
Tragedy struck Idrovo in 1974, when his younger son died. Idrovo expressed his sorrow in the form of a poem, "Weeping for Pedro Jara", which was published in 1978. The English translation of the poem was made by Dr. Cecilia Mafla-Bustamente and published in 1998 in the journal Interdisciplinary Studies in Literature and Environment. The Biographical Dictionary of Ecuador has called it "one of the greatest and most beautiful national poems ever written."

Line 1 (Officially: Millennium Underground Railway, Metro 1 or M1) is the oldest line of the Budapest Metro, it was built from 1894 to 1896. It is known locally as "the small underground" ("a kisföldalatti"), while the M2, M3 and M4 are called "metró". It is the first underground on the European mainland, and the world's third oldest underground after the London Underground and Liverpool's Mersey Railway.
Line 1 runs northeast from the city center on the Pest side under Andrássy út to the Városliget, or City Park. Like Line 3, it does not serve Buda. It's daily ridership is estimated at 80,000.
History
Line 1 is the oldest of the metro lines in Budapest, having been in constant operation since 1896. The line was inaugurated on May 2, 1896, the year of the millennium (the thousandth anniversary of the arrival of the Magyars), by emperor Franz Joseph. The original name of the operator company was "Franz Joseph Underground Electric Railway Company" ().
The original purpose of the first metro line was to facilitate transport to the Budapest City Park along the elegant Andrássy Avenue without building surface transport affecting the streetscape. The National Assembly accepted the metro plan in 1870, and the local Hungarian subsidiary company of the Siemens & Halske AG was commissioned for the construction, starting in 1894. It took 2,000 workers using up-to-date machinery less than two years to complete. This section was built entirely from the surface (with the cut-and-cover method). One original car is preserved at the Seashore Trolley Museum in Kennebunkport, Maine, United States.
The line ran underneath Andrássy Avenue, from Vörösmarty Square (the centre) to City Park, in a northeast-southwest direction. The original terminus was the Zoo (with extension to Mexikói út in 1973). It had eleven stations, nine underground and two (Állatkert and Artézi fürdő) overground. The length of the line was at that time; trains ran every two minutes. It was able to carry as many as 35,000 people a day (today 103,000 people travel on it on a workday).
Reconstruction
1973
Between 1970 and 1973 the line underwent an extension and reconstruction of some sections. Deák tér station was relocated to connect with the M2 line with the old station becoming the Underground Museum. The rolling stock was changed to Ganz MFAV multiple units which still operate on the line. Finally the line's left-hand traffic was changed into right-hand traffic.
The major change to the line was the extension to Mexikói út, the closure of Állatkert and the conversion of Széchenyi fürdő to an underground station.
1896: Gizella tér (today Vörösmarty tér) - Artézi fürdő (today Széchenyi fürdő)
1973: Széchenyi fürdő - Mexikói út
1995
The renovations carried out over the past hundred years have not affected the tunnel section under Andrássy út. As a result, the tunnel - the masonry, the load-bearing steel structures, the insulation against water, the railway track structure, the architecture of the stations - changed little or not at all. From the middle of the 1980s, the serious damage and wear and tear that foreshadowed the necessity and urgency of reconstruction could already be detected.
The ceremonial handover took place in the presence of Mayor Gábor Demszky on September 15 in 1995 as part of an interesting cultural program. What was novel about it was that the audience sat in chairs at the stations, and the production was provided by the artists who got off the trains arriving at the station. Finally, on September 18, passengers were able to take possession of the renewed and beautified small underground. We builders hope it will be used at least as carefully as we built it; then it will continue to serve the traveling public for the next hundred years.

was a Japanese domain of the Edo period, located in Shima Province (part of modern-day Mie Prefecture), Japan. It was centered on Toba Castle in what is now the city of Toba.
History
During the Sengoku period, most of Shima Province came under the control of Kuki Yoshitaka, a retainer of Oda Nobunaga, who had a fleet of armored ships and controlled maritime traffic around Ise Bay. The Kuki clan fought on both sides during the Battle of Sekigahara, with Kuki Yoshitaka siding with the western forces loyal to Toyotomi Hideyori, and his son Kuki Moritaka, joining the eastern armies of Tokugawa Ieyasu. With the establishment of the Tokugawa shogunate, Kuki Moritaka was confirmed as daimyō of Toba, initially with a kokudaka of 35,000 koku, growing to 55,000 koku under his son Kuki Hisataka, who was transferred to Sanda Domain in Settsu Province in 1632.
The Kuki were replaced by a cadet branch of the Naitō clan, which ruled Toba until Naito Tadakatsu was forced to commit seppuku after killing fellow daimyō Nagai Naonaga in 1680. The domain then reverted to tenryō status under the direct control of the shogunate several months before it was reassigned to the Doi clan (1681–1691), Ogyu-Matsudaira clan (1691–1710), Itakura clan (1710–1717), and Toda-Matsudaira clan (1717–1725) before finally coming under the Inagaki clan (1725–1871), where it remained until the Meiji Restoration.
During the Boshin War, the domain remained loyal to the Shogunate and its forces fought in the Tokugawa army during the Battle of Toba-Fushimi. However, daimyō Inagaki Nagayuki was underage, and remained in Edo during the battle. After the Tokugawa defeat, the domain defected to the Imperial side, and as a result was fined heavily by the Meiji government. Inagaki Nagayuki was forced into retirement. His son, Inagaki Nagahiro became domain governor, and after the abolition of the han system in July 1871, Toba Domain became "Toba Prefecture", which merged with the short-lived "Watarai Prefecture" in November 1871, which later became part of Mie Prefecture.
Bakumatsu period holdings
As with most domains in the han system, Toba Domain consisted of several discontinuous territories calculated to provide the assigned kokudaka, based on periodic cadastral surveys and projected agricultural yields.

My Life in Court is a 1961 memoir by American trial lawyer Louis Nizer documenting his career in law. The work was the best seller when it was first released, lasting for 72 weeks on The New York Times Bestsellers list.
Background
The book is based on a number of court cases that Nizer argued in US courts. The original papers for many of these trials are held by the Columbia Law Library.
Contents
All six cases depicted within the book are civil cases, which is unusual for legal fiction and non-fiction because of the greater sensationality of criminal law cases. The book depicts the following cases:
Baron v. Leo Feist
Reynolds v. Pegler (a landmark libel decision in which Quentin Reynolds successfully sued right-wing columnist Westbrook Pegler, resulting in a record judgment of $175,001)
Bercovici v. Chaplin (a plagiarism lawsuit in 1947 against Charlie Chaplin)
Cambell v. Loew's Inc.—which was presided over by judge Collins J. Seitz.
Eleanor Holm v Billy Rose
Foerster v. Ridder
Dolly Astor v. John Astor
Reception
The book was received favorably. Commentary magazine reviewer David T. Bazelon said he did not "understand why it has become a bestseller", but all in all "Properly read, it is an occasion for some real understanding of the trial man. Haphazardly or naively read, it is interesting, instructive, and even exciting." Bazelon challenges praise by Max Lerner that the work is "one of the great legal autobiographies of our time". Kirkus reviews gave less praise, calling the book "direct and orderly" and enjoyable by "Trial lawyers, law students, and the general public".
For the most part, academic and legal reviewers of the autobiography were particularly harsh critics of the book. In The Modern Law Review, British reviewer C.P. Harvey commented "I cannot help wondering what made Messrs. Heinmann think it would be good business to publish this book in [the United Kingdom]." He writes "I pronounce this book to be didactic, long-winded and pretentious" and describes it as an example of "the breadth of the ocean which lies between the English and American legal systems."
In the Osgoode Hall Law Journal, reviewer R. N. Starr described the work as not exactly realistic, and taken to "poetic license". His review is rather skeptical and mixed; he writes: "For my own part I would have preferred it, had Mr. Nizer put his wide experience to other purposes." In the Yale Law Review Joseph W. Bishop lambasts the piece as demonstrating the decline of legal practice, jury tried cases, and the flaws of the legal profession. Nonetheless, he describes the book as anything but "dry and indigestable reading" which is usually the case for accounts of legal cases.
Unlike other academic reviewers, American Bar Association Journal reviewer Alfred Schweppe praised the book as a "must for every lawyer searching for an answer to success in the courtroom" and the describing the style as "Moving with an easy finished prose".
Legacy
The book has inspired a number of people to become lawyers, including Laurie Levenson
and Roy Black.
Nizer's subsequent book The Jury Returns follows much the same format and pattern as My Life in Court, attempting to create a similar work and success.
Adaptations
The book was adapted into the 1963 Broadway play A Case of Libel. The book was also adapted into a television film. Both depict the Reynolds v. Pegler case.

George Everett Osterhout (March 31, 1858 – April 2, 1937) was an American businessman and botanist. A Pennsylvania native, he later moved to Colorado and became known for his research into the flora of the Rocky Mountains.
Early life and education
Born in Tunkhannock, Pennsylvania, he later went to Easton, Pennsylvania where he graduated from Lafayette College. After graduation he undertook studies in the law, and was admitted to the Pennsylvania bar.
Career
In 1885, at age 27, he moved to Windsor, Colorado, either in search of better health, wrote Aven Nelson, or to pursue a strong desire to study Rocky Mountain plants, inspired by one of his college professors, according to Roger Lawrence Williams. He established a lumber business in Windsor, and resided there for the rest of his life, "where he was known as a successful businessman, a kindly neighbor, a philanthropic Christian, a scientist of more than local renown." His strong avocation, collecting native plants of the Rocky Mountain region, began in 1893. He consulted with professional botanists, especially Aven Nelson of the University of Wyoming, and Per Axel Rydberg.
His personal herbarium grew to over 20,000 specimen sheets. Of these, 8,330 were of his own collections, and described by Roger Lawrence Williams as "testimony to leisure time arduously spent." The others Osterhout acquired via trading or purchase. Upon his death, all of his sheets were bequeathed to the Rocky Mountain Herbarium.
According to IPNI, his botanical author abbreviation, Osterh., is associated with 237 plant names or historical variations theron.
His nomenclatural efforts appear within his 44 publications, as listed by Roger Williams, which also includes two essays on Rocky Mountain botanizing, one a commemoration of the 100th anniversary of the first major botanical exploration of the Rocky Mountains in 1820 (as described in an account by Edwin James).
Plants named in Osterhout's honor
According to ITIS () these five plants are named in honor of George E. Osterhout:
Astragalus osterhoutii M.E. Jones – Osterhout's milk-vetch
Cirsium clavatum var. osterhoutii (Rydb.) D.J. Keil – Osterhout's thistle
Cryptantha osterhoutii (Payson) Payson – Osterhout's catseye
Penstemon osterhoutii Pennell – Osterhout's beardtongue
Physaria floribunda ssp. osterhoutii (Payson) O'Kane – pointtip twinpod

Jiang Qing and Her Husbands is a Chinese historical play written by Sha Yexin in 1990. The play follows Jiang Qing from a young actress in the 1930s to the most powerful Chinese woman in the 1970s, focusing on her relationships with the many men in her life including Mao Zedong. The play draws comparisons between Jiang Qing and one of her best-known acting roles, Nora in Henrik Ibsen's A Doll's House.
Owing to its highly sensitive subject, the play was banned in both mainland China and British Hong Kong. In 2010, the play was adapted by Perry Chiu Experimental Theatre and premiered in Hong Kong's Sheung Wan Civic Centre in Cantonese. Starring Perry Chiu as Jiang Qing and produced by Chiu's husband Clifton Ko, the adaptation was also successfully performed in Canada, but actually differs in content from the original. The adaptation's English title is I Am Chairman Mao's Bitch!, which derives from a famous quote by Jiang Qing during her 1980 trial (and also featured in the play): "I was Chairman Mao's dog. When he told me to bite someone, I did it."

Jiang Qing, known as Lan Ping before 1938

Mao Zedong, Jiang Qing's final husband

Cacahuaziziqui is a pre-Columbian cave site containing Olmec paintings. It is located in the Mexican province of Guerrero on the southern coast of the country. The site is located 30 miles west of Oxtotitlan and Juxtlahuaca and southeast of Tlapa, a mountainous area in the Guerrero state. The Guerrero caves are often located in remote canyons.
Major features
The cave itself is shallow, reportedly more like a large rock shelter. There are more than 100 paintings in total, most of them being stick figures and “unidentifiable schematic designs.” There is an emphasis on flat shapes and the use of multiple colors, in a polychrome style. The Olmec paintings are bold and massive, similar in theory to the Olmec sculpture style. There are two distinct character paintings among the many indistinguishable stick figures and schematic designs.
Painting #1
Using only white paint, Painting 1 is a flat silhouette of a figure with a helmet like head covering. This head covering is echoed in other Olmec art, notably the Olmec Heads and is typical in Olmec costuming. Another aspect of this painting that is significant is that the figure is raising one arm. This gesture is common in Olmec rock art and is seen in the Oxtotitlan cave painting of the ithyphallic man and jaguar.
Painting #2
A larger painting, of an incomplete character also found at the Cacahuaziziqui site has raised interesting questions. This painting is of a figure wearing an ornate headdress decorated with what appear to be “symbolic motifs.” It is polychromatic in that it makes use of white, yellow and some red. If the figure were complete it would be larger than life-size.
The two principal characters of the Cacahuaziziqui cave can be associated to the Olmec group because they share many of the same categories of formal and iconographic imagery with Juxtlhuaca. Painting 1, dominated by the color white, and Painting 2, with a yellow body and white face, indicated that these characters might be representative of deities. The Olmecs were clever in the creation of their paintings. Using larger, bold figures to cover the available rock space as well as using the contours of the rock, they were painting on gave them a harmonious blending with the environment. Large filled in paintings with simple design would allow them to be easily seen in the limited available light.
Comparisons/Conclusion
The sophisticated manipulation of form in the Guerrero cave paintings suggests that the “cave artists were court painters and the caves were used by some local elites.” With that said, at Juxtlahuaca and Oxtotitlan the paintings are certainly the work of well trained artists, practiced in the themes and pictorial conventions of Olmec art but the Cacahuaziziqui paintings have a “cruder provincial flavor.” The paintings from the Guerrero caves are of great value to themselves for they are the only paintings in the area that are known to be from the Olmec culture.

The Tactical High Power Operational Responder (THOR) is a high-energy microwave laser directed-energy weapon by the United States Air Force Research Laboratory.
The weapon uses a powerful microwave burst to produce an unspecified "counter-electronic effect", with the intention of disabiling unmanned aircraft. The THOR project is led by the Air Force Strategic Development Planning & Experimentation (SDPE) Office. The weapon is considered inventory of the United States Air Force High Energy Laser Weapon Systems (HELWS). In December of 2020, it was reported that the weapon was deployed in Africa for testing.

Widmar v. Vincent, 454 U.S. 263 (1981), held that when the U.S. government provides an "open forum," it may not discriminate against speech that takes place within that forum on the basis of the viewpoint it expresses—in this case, against religious speech engaged in by an evangelical Christian organization.
Facts
Cornerstone, a Christian organization for students of the University of Missouri–Kansas City, had for many years, with University permission, used classrooms for its weekly meetings. In 1977 the group sought to use additional room for religious services, outside of instructional hours. The university rejected the request, citing university and state regulations prohibiting the use of the public space for worship, as a violation of the Establishment Clause.
Cornerstone filed suit in United States District Court for the Western District of Missouri, and the district court issued a summary judgement in favor of the University. Upon appeal, the Eighth Circuit reversed the district court, whereupon the university appealed to the US Supreme Court.
Majority opinion
In an 8–1 decision, Justice Lewis Powell wrote for the majority, that "through its policy of accommodating their meetings, the University [had] created a forum generally open for use by student groups." In order to justify the exclusion of speech from such a public forum based on the speech's religious content, the University "must show that its regulation is necessary to serve a compelling state interest and that it is narrowly drawn to achieve that end."
In this case, the University asserted an interest in fulfilling its responsibilities under the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment. The Court agreed that this would count as a compelling state interest. But Powell argues that a regulation opening facilities to both religious and secular groups would pass the three-pronged test established in Lemon v. Kurtzman (1971). The regulation plainly would have a secular purpose. It wouldn't entangle the state excessively with religion. And it doesn't have a primary effect of advancing or inhibiting religion.
The University's argument [that to allow Cornerstone access to the rooms] misconceives the nature of this case. The question is not whether the creation of a religious forum would violate the Establishment Clause. The University has opened its facilities for use by student groups, and the question is whether it can now exclude groups because of the content of their speech. In this context, we are unpersuaded that the primary effect of the public forum, open to all forms of discourse, would be to advance religion.
Powell concluded that it was specious to argue that this use of the rooms would "advance" religion, and thus Cornerstone won its case.
Stevens' concurring opinion
Justice Stevens concurred in the Court's opinion, but wrote a concurrence to note a minor disagreement about whether or not the situation even amounted to a "forum".
Dissenting opinion
Justice White held that, while the university was not prohibited from granting Cornerstone the right to use the rooms for religious service, strongly asserted that the university had no obligation to do so. What is "can do" is not the same as what it "must do", he stated.
Aftermath
In 1984, Congress passed a law, the Equal Access Act of 1984, which extended the effect of the Court's opinion in Widmar to all secondary schools that receive federal education funds.

The Monti cabinet was the sixty-first cabinet of the government of Italy and was announced on 16 November 2011. This Experts' cabinet was composed of independents, three of whom were women and was formed as an interim government. The government ran the country for eighteen months until the aftermath of the elections in Spring 2013 and then replaced by the Letta Cabinet, formed by Enrico Letta on 28 April.
Formation
On 9 November 2011, Monti was appointed a senator for life by Italian President Giorgio Napolitano. He was seen as a favourite to replace Silvio Berlusconi and lead a new unity government in Italy in order to implement reforms and austerity measures. The ultimate purpose of Monti's appointment was to save Italy from the eurozone sovereign debt crisis.
On 12 November 2011, following Berlusconi's resignation, Napolitano asked Monti to form a new government. Monti accepted, and held talks with the leaders of the main Italian political parties, declaring that he wanted to form a government that would remain in office until the next scheduled general elections in 2013. On 16 November 2011, Monti was sworn in as Prime Minister of Italy, after making known a technocratic cabinet composed entirely of unelected professionals. He also chose to hold personally the post of Minister of Economy and Finance. His tenure in the latter post lasted until 11 July 2012 when Vittorio Grilli, previously vice-minister, became Minister.
On 17 and 18 November 2011, the Italian Senate and Italian Chamber of Deputies both passed motions of confidence supporting Monti's government, with only the Northern League voting against.

This was the first time the government of a provincial capital had been dismissed.

The Moth is the name of two American comic-book superhero characters. The first was created by artist Jim Mooney and an unknown writer for Fox Feature Syndicate in 1940, during the period fans and historians call the Golden Age of Comic Books. The second was created by writer-artist Steve Rude in 1998 for Dark Horse Comics.
Fox Feature Syndicate
One of the first comic-book superheroes, the Moth was created by artist Jim Mooney and an unknown writer using the joint pseudonym "Norton Kingsley", which at least once was rendered as "Norman Kingsley". The character — a superhero whose sole apparent superpower, flight, was never explained as either natural or as an ability built into his costume — debuted in comic-book publisher Fox Feature Syndicate's Mystery Men Comics #9 (cover-dated April 1940), during the period fans and historians call the Golden Age of Comic Books.
According to Jess Nevins' Encyclopedia of Golden Age Superheroes, "he fights a life-draining mad scientist, the Weather Kings (who use weather control machines in an attempt to take over the United States), a Dr. Frankenstein-like grave-robbing mad scientist, and others".
The Moth starred in four stories, drawn either all by Mooney or with the second drawn by Greg Chapian, both using the Kingsley pseudonym. The feature ended with Mystery Men Comics #12 (July 1940).
Dark Horse Comics
Publication history
The Moth (real name Jack Mahoney) is a fictional superhero published by Dark Horse Comics. Created by Steve Rude, The Moth first appeared in Dark Horse Presents #138, followed by an appearance in Madman Comics #13 by Dark Horse Comics, and then the 56-page The Moth - Special (March 2004).
Fictional character biography
The Moth is a circus performer named Jack Mahoney. Mahoney developed the Moth costume for his high-wire act, and he also uses it catch wanted criminals in exchange for bounties.
During his four-issue solo series, the Moth encounters a biker gang whose leader has had a bounty offered for his capture. The Moth turns him over to the authorities. He also encounters a supernatural lion-man who is on a killing spree. His victims include the Moth's mentor Victor, the ringmaster of the circus where the Moth performed, and a member of the biker gang. The Moth inherits the circus and enlists the help of the biker gang he clashed with earlier to help him track down the creature and exact revenge.
In the next story, the Moth turns rival mob families against each other in order to collect bounties offered for the leaders of both groups.

Abuja Stock Exchange (ASE) was set up in 2000 and went live in 2001. It was the first exchange in Nigeria to provide electronic trading, clearing and settlement for both the primary market and secondary markets. It was set up to trade in equities, unlisted stocks and plain vanilla bonds.
Soon after its launch a government notification forced it to close its operations. This was orchestrated by the more powerful Nigerian Stock Exchange which lobbied with the government to maintain its monopoly over the Nigerian stock markets. The reasoning for the notification was that there was no need for a second stock exchange in the country.
However, efforts are currently on to convert the existing infrastructure into a multicommodity exchange commodities exchange.

The Adaha was type of highlife that was played on flutes, fifes, and brass band drums which originated in Ghana in the 19th century and then spread across West Africa during the 1930s
History
The Adaha was a style of music played in the coastal areas by the Fante people in the 1880s. The Adaha music of the Fante was the earliest documented syncopated style of brass band. European and West Indian soldiers taught Africans to read music and to play brass and woodwind instruments. The music of the colonial military brass bands evolved into Adaha highlife. The local African people created their own blend of brass band music from marches, polkas and nineteen century ballads. The Adaha music spread throughout the villages which made the people adapt to drums and call and response singing. It was centered in cities and towns such as Cape Coast and Elmina.

Centro 73 (pronounced ) was a social and cultural centre in Chișinău and the first squat created in Moldova. The early twentieth century villa at 73 Alexei Mateevici street was a monumental building which the owner intended to demolish. It was occupied in August 2010 and evicted in December the same year.
History
The villa at 73 Alexei Mateevici street in Chişinău, the capital of Moldova, was constructed in the early twentieth century and was rated as a local monument by the Academy of Sciences. After World War II, it was lived in by a Romanian general. In 2005, the president of the Academy bought the building, intending to live there, and after two years sold it to an Italian businessman. The villa then stood empty for several years.
Social centre
Inspired by squatting movements in other European countries, artists and students occupied the villa in August 2010. It was in a bad condition and with the help of volunteers it was cleaned up. It opened to the public on 25 September 2010 as Centro 73, the first squatted, self-managed social centre in Moldova. The centre was used as a place for alternative culture and events such as concerts and exhibitions were organized. On 20 November 2010, Centro 73 did a solidarity action for freedom of political prisoners in Belarus.
The Italian owner intended to demolish the building despite its monumental status, which concerned the occupiers since in the previous two years, forty buildings out of a total of 977 monuments had been demolished. On 1 November 2010, a protest was organised by Centro 73 against demolitions under the slogan "Salvaţi Chişinăul istoric" ("Save historic Chişinău"). This was featured in local media such as Publika TV and Jurnal TV. The building was evicted in December 2010 and the squatters claimed a victory since the owner had pledged to renovate instead of destroying it. Afterwards, the same group of people briefly occupied the former Turkish embassy, also on Alexei Mateevici street. They then set up Art Labyrinth in collaboration with the city authorities. The legally established cultural centre based in an old museum provided space for concerts, meetings and art exhibitions.

, trading as , is a Japanese private railway company that provides commuter and interurban service to the northern Kansai region and is one of the flagship properties of Hankyu Hanshin Holdings Inc., in turn part of the Hankyu Hanshin Toho Group (which includes H2O Retailing Corporation and Toho Co., the creator of Godzilla). The railway's main terminal is at Umeda Station in Osaka. The signature color of Hankyu cars is maroon.
The Hankyu network serves 1,950,000 people every weekday and offers several types of express service with no extra charge.
The head offices of Hankyu Hanshin Holdings, Inc. and Hankyu Corporation are at 1-16-1, Shibata, Kita-ku, Osaka; the both companies' registered headquarters are at 1-1, Sakaemachi, Ikeda, Osaka Prefecture.
The Takarazuka Revue, an all-female musical theatre performance company, is well known as a division of the Hankyu railway company; all of its members are employed by Hankyu.
History
Etymology
The name is an abbreviation of .
refers to the area served by Hankyu trains, comprising the cities of , and , along with the suburbs that connect them to each other.
means "express train(s)".
Foundation
In 1907, the , a forerunner of Hankyu Hanshin Holdings, Inc., was established by Ichizō Kobayashi (precisely, he was one of the "promoters" of the tramway).
On 10 March 1910, Minoo Arima Tramway opened the rail lines from Umeda to Takarazuka (the Takarazuka Main Line) and from Ishibashi to Minoo (the Minoo Line). The tramway was popular due to Kobayashi's pioneering act to develop housing around stations along the line (a first in Japan), a forerunner to transit-oriented developments.
Expansion to Kobe
On February 4, 1918, Minoo Arima Tramway was renamed .
On July 16, 1920, the Kobe Main Line from Jūsō to Kobe (later, renamed Kamitsutsui) and the Itami Line from Tsukaguchi to Itami were opened.
On April 1, 1936, the Kobe Main Line was extended from Nishi-Nada (present-day Ōji-kōen) to the new terminal in Kobe (present-day Kobe-Sannomiya Station), and the Kobe Main Line from Nishi-Nada to Kamitsutsui was named the Kamitsutsui Line, which was abandoned on May 20, 1940.
In 1936, Hankyu established a professional baseball team and in 1937 the Nishinomiya Stadium as the team's home field was completed near Nishinomiya-Kitaguchi Station. The Hankyu Braves (named in 1947) played until the 1988 season and became the predecessors of the present-day Orix Buffaloes.
Merger and separation with Keihan
On October 1, 1943, under the order of the government, Hanshin Kyūkō and Keihan Electric Railway were merged, and renamed . The merged lines included the Keihan Main Line, the Uji Line, the Shinkeihan Line (present-day Kyoto Main Line), the Senriyama Line (present-day Senri Line), the Jūsō Line (part of Kyoto Main Line), the Arashiyama Line, the Keishin Line and the Ishiyama Sakamoto Line. The Katano Line was also added in 1945.
On December 1, 1949, the Keihan Main Line, the Katano Line, the Uji Line, the Keishin Line, and the Ishiyama-Sakamoto Line were split off to become part of the newly established Keihan Electric Railway Co., Ltd. Although this revived the former Keihan Electric Railway, Keihan was now smaller than before the 1943 merger, because the Shinkeihan Line and its branches were not given up by Keihanshin. The present structure of the Hankyu network with the three main lines was fixed by this transaction. The abbreviation of Keihanshin Kyūkō Railway was changed from "Keihanshin" to "Hankyū".
Postwar development
On April 7, 1968, the Kobe Main Line started through service to the Kobe Rapid Transit Railway Tozai Line and the Sanyo Electric Railway Main Line.
On December 6, 1969, the Kyoto Main Line and the Senri Line started through service to the Osaka Municipal Subway Sakaisuji Line. In 1970, the Senri Line was one of access routes to the Expo '70 held in Senri area.
On April 1, 1973, Keihanshin Kyūkō Railway Company assumed its current name.
On April 1, 2005, former Hankyu Corporation became a holding company and was renamed . The railway business was ceded to a subsidiary, now named Hankyu Corporation (before the restructuring, the new company which reused a dormant company founded on December 7, 1989, was called until March 28, 2004, then from the next day).
On October 1, 2006, Hankyu Holdings became the wholly owning parent company of Hanshin Electric Railway Co., Ltd. and the holdings were renamed Hankyu Hanshin Holdings, Inc.. Hankyu's stock purchase of Hanshin shares was completed on June 20, 2006.
Rail lines
Hankyu operates three main trunk lines, connecting Osaka with Kobe, Takarazuka and Kyoto respectively, and their branches.
{{legend-line|#3388cf solid 3px|Kōbe Main Line () (Category-1: Umeda – Kobe-sannomiya)'}}
The three groups of the lines, the Kobe Lines, the Takarazuka Lines and the Kyoto Lines, can be further grouped into two, the Kobe-Takarazuka Lines and the Kyoto Lines from a historical reason. Hankyu has two groups of rolling stock, one for the Kobe-Takarazuka Lines and the other for the Kyoto Lines.

In popular culture
A 2-car Hankyu train was featured in the 1988 Japanese animated war drama Grave of the Fireflies.
One 2008 book by the Japanese writer Hiro Arikawa, , occurs entirely on the Hankyu–Imazu line, in the north-west suburbs of Osaka, where various characters meet and interact in the trains and at the various stations of the line. It was made into a film in 2011, titled Hankyu Railway: A 15-Minute Miracle''.
The Hankyu 2000 is the locomotive of choice for the main character, Takumi Fujiwara, in Densha de D. A parody of Initial D where the main characters race with trains instead of cars.

Winston Spencer-Churchill (10 October 1940 – 2 March 2010), generally known as Winston Churchill, was an English Conservative politician and a grandson of former British Prime Minister Sir Winston Churchill. During the period of his prominence as a public figure, he was normally referred to as Winston Churchill , in order to distinguish him from his grandfather. His father Randolph Churchill was also an MP.
Early life
Churchill was born at Chequers five months after his grandfather became Prime Minister, a year into the Second World War. He was educated at Ludgrove, Harrow school and at Christ Church, Oxford. His famous grandfather died in 1965, and his father died three years afterwards.
Career as a journalist
Before becoming a Member of Parliament, he was a journalist, notably in the Middle East during the Six-Day War, during which time he met numerous Israeli politicians, including Moshe Dayan, and published a book recounting the war. During the 1960s he covered conflicts in Yemen and Borneo as well as the Vietnam War. In 1968, he visited Czechoslovakia to record the Prague Spring and when the Democratic Convention was held in the wake of public assassinations at Chicago in the same year he was attacked by the police.
In the early 1970s at Biafra, Nigeria, he witnessed both war and famine and the indiscriminate bombing of civilians was an outrage to him. He reported in further in trouble spots including Communist China, and the carnation revolution in Portugal. Like other members of his family, he began a lecture tour of the United States.
In 1965, he became a member of the Pennsylvania Society of the Sons of the American Revolution.
Political career
Churchill was not able to take up his grandfather's parliamentary seat at Woodford in Essex when he stepped down at the 1964 general election, three months before his death at the age of 90. However, he was at the centre of the Conservative campaign: despite being quite inexperienced in politics, he had been appointed as Edward Heath's personal assistant. Heath was already a senior cabinet minister, and the following year was elected leader of the party following the resignation of Sir Alec Douglas-Home, who lost the general election to Labour and Harold Wilson.
Churchill's first attempt to enter Parliament was at the 1967 Manchester Gorton by-election. In spite of the unpopularity of the incumbent Labour government, he lost, but only by 577 votes. Winston was still a journalist with The Daily Telegraph when his father died in 1968; the paper's proprietor, Lord Hartwell, took the decision to employ Martin Gilbert to continue the work on the former Prime Minister's biography that Randolph had started.
Churchill became Member of Parliament for the constituency of Stretford, near Manchester, at the 1970 general election. As an MP he was a member of the parliamentary ski team and chairman of the Commons Flying Club. He became a friend of Julian Amery MP, who as Minister for Housing and Construction at the Department of the Environment, appointed him his Parliamentary Private Secretary. Churchill was not much interested in the mundane questions of housing, however, and doing as little as possible, took questions to the House from civil servants. Transferred to the Foreign Office with Amery, he became very outspoken on issues in the Middle East and on the Communist Bloc. After he attempted to question Alec Douglas-Home's abilities as Foreign Secretary, he was forced to resign in November 1973, just over three months before the Conservatives lost power to Harold Wilson's Labour Party for the second time in a decade.
Churchill resumed the family tradition of protecting Ulster Unionism, defending the Diplock Courts, internment and arguing for the death penalty for terrorists. He was part of a group of Conservative MPs of the era (including Margaret Thatcher) who were heavily critical of BBC coverage of the conflict in Northern Ireland as expressing communist sympathies, for which some journalists were sacked.
As a frontbench spokesman on defence policy, he took a hardline on Rhodesia, voting against any sanctions. His presentation at the despatch box was strident for the times, censured by the Speaker for calling Foreign Secretary David Owen "treacherous" over the abandonment of Rhodesia. Thatcher, who succeeded Edward Heath as Conservative leader in 1975, dismissed Churchill from the front bench of politics in November 1978. However, when the Conservatives came to power in the election of May 1979 he was elected to the executive of the 1922 Committee.
Boundary changes which took effect at the 1983 general election made his seat more marginal (it was subsequently taken by the Labour Party), and he transferred to the nearby Davyhulme constituency, which he represented until the seat was abolished for the 1997 general election. Although well known by virtue of his family history, he never achieved high office and remained a backbencher. His cousin, Nicholas Soames, was first elected a Conservative MP in 1983 and remained in parliament until 2019.
During his time as a Member of Parliament, Churchill visited Beijing with a delegation of other MPs, including Clement Freud, a grandson of the psychoanalyst Sigmund Freud. Freud asked why Churchill was given the best room in the hotel, and was told it was because Churchill was a grandson of Britain's most illustrious Prime Minister. Freud responded by saying it was the first time in his life that he had been "out-grandfathered".
After the 1990–91 Gulf War, Churchill visited British troops in the desert. When he introduced himself to a soldier, the soldier replied "Yes, and I'm Rommel", highlighting, as his father had told him, the comparative disadvantage in his name.
He was the subject of controversy in 1995 when he and his family sold a large archive of his grandfather's papers for £12.5m to Churchill College, Cambridge. The purchase was funded by a grant from the newly established National Lottery.
After leaving Parliament at the 1997 election (with his Davyhulme seat being abolished), Churchill was a sought-after speaker on the lecture circuit and wrote many articles in support of the Iraq War and the fight against Islamic terrorism. He also edited a compilation of his grandfather's famous speeches entitled Never Give In. In 2007, he acted as a spokesman for the pressure group UK National Defence Association. He was also involved with the National Benevolent Fund for the Aged, as trustee from 1974 and chair from 1995 to 2010.
He attempted to be selected as an MEP, but was unsuccessful.
Family
Churchill was the son of Randolph Churchill (1911–1968), the only son of Sir Winston Churchill, and of Randolph's wife Pamela Digby (1920–1997), later to become famous as Pamela Harriman. His parents divorced in 1945. His father married June Osborne: their daughter was Arabella Churchill (1949–2007).
Churchill's first marriage, in July 1964, was to Mary "Minnie" Caroline d'Erlanger, the daughter of the banker Sir Gerard John Regis d'Erlanger and granddaughter of Baron Emile Beaumont d'Erlanger. The couple had four children. Churchill's second marriage, to Luce Engelen, a Belgian-born jewellery maker, lasted from 1997 until his death.
Ancestry
Death
Churchill lived in Belgravia, London, where he died aged 69 on 2 March 2010 from prostate cancer, from which he had suffered for the last two years of his life. On 9 March, he was buried in the family plot at St Martin's Church in Bladon, near Woodstock, Oxfordshire.

Zenas the Lawyer () was a first-century Christian mentioned in Paul the Apostle's Epistle to Titus in the New Testament. In Titus 3:13, Paul writes: "Bring Zenas the lawyer and Apollos on their journey diligently, that nothing be wanting unto them" (KJV). His name is a shortened form of "Zenodoros", meaning "gift of Zeus". By tradition, he is often counted as one of the unnamed seventy disciples sent out by Jesus into the villages of Galilee, as mentioned in .
It has been suggested that Zenas was the inaugural bishop of Lydda and the author of the Acts of Titus. Some have suggested that Zenas is also mentioned in the apocryphal Acts of Paul under the name of Zenon, the son of Onesiphorus.
Zenas the Lawyer is venerated as a saint by the Roman Catholic Church (April 14), Eastern Orthodox Church (September 27 (by Julian Calendar), January 4), and other Christian Churches.
Occupation
There has been debate among scholars about the description of Zenas as a "lawyer", as the Greek word used can refer to an expert in either Jewish or Roman law. It is possible that Paul only mentions his profession in order to avoid confusion with another "Zenas".
Proponents of the view that Zenas was an expert in Jewish law have pointed to a number of facts, including other New Testament uses of the word, his association with Apollos (a Jewish convert to Christianity) and the use of the related word for "Law" (referring to the Law of Moses) earlier in the letter. Others have argued against this view by pointing to extra-biblical uses of the word and Paul's attitude to experts in the Law in his other letters.

The Flag of the Komi Republic () in Russia is one of the official symbols of the federal subject, alongside the coat of arms and the State Anthem of the Komi Republic. The flag is a horizontal tricolour with 2:3 proportion. The flag was composed of three bars of, from top to bottom, medium blue, green, and white.
Prior to 1991, the Komi Republic existed as the Komi Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic. The flag of the Komi ASSR corresponds to the flag of the Russian SFSR with additional inscriptions.
Symbolism
The flag represents Komi's natural wealth. The blue represents the splendour and spaciousness of the northern sky. The green represents nature, its bounty, and the taiga. The white represents the color of snow, the purity of nature in the north, simplicity, and austerity, as well as Komi being a country in the north. According to a different interpretation, the white represents the equality and unity of the people and cultures living in Komi. Also notable is the similarity of the flag to the national flag of tribal Estonians.
Legislation
Currently, the law that regulates the flag of Komi Republic is the Law "On the State Flag of the Komi Republic". The law entered into force on 6 July 1994. The latest amendment was enacted on 26 June 2017.
Flag protocol
By law, the Komi flag should be flown daily, weather permitting, from the following locations:
the State Council of the Komi Republic
the residence of the ministers of Komi
courts of Komi, and offices of local executive and administrative bodies
above buildings in which sessions of local Councils of deputies take place
buildings used by Komi diplomats
The Komi flag is also officially flown on the sites of special occasions:
official ceremonies
family celebrations
celebrations held by public authorities of the Republic of Komi, public associations, enterprises, institutions and organizations.
When the flag was simultaneously raised among other flags of the constituent entities of the Russian Federation, the sequence and their location is determined in accordance with the sequence of enumeration of constituent entities of the Russian Federation in the Constitution of the Russian Federation.
While simultaneously raising the flag among the flags of foreign countries, the sequence of their location is determined alphabetically.
Half-mast
The law also allows the flag to be raised half-mast as a symbol of mourning. In such cases, in the upper part of the mast of the flag, a black ribbon is fastened, the length of which is equal to the length of the flag panel.
Flag desecration
According to article 13 of the law, the expression of disrespect, as well as desecration of the national flag is punishable by the Law of the Republic of Komi "On Administrative Responsibility in the Republic of Komi".
Color specifications
The law of the Komi Republic only says that the colors of the flag are "blue", "green", and "white". It does not specify the exact colors of the flag. In practice, however, official flags tend to use the following colors:
History
As the Komi ASSR
The first flag of the Komi ASSR was described in the first Constitution of the Komi ASSR, which was adopted by the Central Executive Committee of the Komi ASSR on 26 May 1937, at the 11th Extraordinary Congress of Soviets of the Komi ASSR. The flag was a red flag, in the left corner of which, at the top of the shaft, are placed the golden letters "RSFSR" in Russian and Komi languages, with the inscription "Komi ASSR" under it in Russian and Komi language. The inscription changed in 1938 after a new writing system for the Komi language was adopted.
On 23 July 1954, with the amendment of the constitution of the Komi ASSR and the change of the flag of the Russian SFSR, a new flag of the Komi ASSR was adopted. The flag was the same with the flag of the Russian SFSR, but with the inscription "Коми АССР" under the hammer and sickle.
As the Komi Republic
The flag of the Komi Republic was introduced by the Resolution of the Plenum of the Supreme Court of the Komi SSR on 27 November 1991, and by the law "On the Approval of the State Flag of the Komi SSR and Amendments to the Constitution of the Komi SSR". The national flag of the Komi Republic was finally approved and enacted on June 6, 1994, by the Law "On the State Flag of the Komi Republic".
The law was amended by the State Council on December 17, 1997 to change the proportions of the flag from 1:2 to 2:3. The change of the proportion was due to the desire to make the flags of Russia and Komi identical in size when hung together. The provision on the flag of Russia prohibits posting next to it flags of entities that exceed its size. The 1:2 proportion of the flag next to the Russian flag looked too narrow.
Nordic cross proposal
In recent years Komi activists have been calling for the adoption of a new flag for the republic featuring a Nordic cross. Supporters of the change argue that the Nordic cross flag is better suited for Komi as it highlights its connection to Finland and Scandinavia, the Komi being related to the Finns. The most widely used flag was created by Sergey Sivkov in 2011 and uses the colors of the current flag. Blue symbolizes the lakes and rivers of the land, green for the taiga, and white for the snowy winters.

Contempt of the Sovereign (also called contempt of statute) was an ancient doctrine in English law dating from medieval times, and now obsolete. It was the crime imputed by common law whereby a person disobeyed an Act of Parliament which did not say what the penalty was nor how it was to be enforced – the crime itself was recognised. The doctrine was based on the original custom that an Act of Parliament was an expression of the Sovereign's will, enacted with the "advice and consent" of Parliament. It has been mainly overturned in precedent since the English interregnum. Thus in modern jurisprudence, contravening a statute is not a crime unless the statute expressly says so in clear terms.
The last time it was used was in 1840.
(It is not to be confused with lèse majesté.)

The Central Yakutian Lowland or Central Yakutian Lowlands (; ), also known as Central Yakut Plain or Vilyuy Lowland, is a low alluvial plain in Siberia, Russia.
Administratively the territory of the lowland is part of the Sakha Republic (Yakutia). It is an extensive plain located in the transition zone between Central and Eastern Siberia and is one of the Great Russian Regions. The main city is Yakutsk, with a number of settlements near it, but the area of the lowland is largely uninhabited elsewhere.
Geography
The Central Yakutian Lowlands extend along the middle basin of the Lena River and partly further downstream and are about in length and wide. They drop gradually from the Central Siberian Plateau to the west and the Lena Plateau to the south and southwest. To the northwest the lowland merges with the North Siberian Lowland and to the north it is bound by the watershed fringing the Lena and Olenyok River basins, and to the northeast and east the Central Yakutian Lowland reaches the foothills of the Verkhoyansk Range, westernmost part of the East Siberian Mountains.
The Central Yakutian Lowlands are a flat plain, slightly higher in its peripheral parts. Permafrost is continuous throughout the region. Owing to poor drainage, swamps and thermokarst lakes (alases), are common, as well as low bulges or bumps known as "bulgunnyakh" (). In the northwest the Tukulan (Тукуланы) sand dunes are relief forms shaped by aeolian processes along the valley of the Lena River. There are also some areas of high soil salinity.
Hydrography
There are hundreds of river valleys all across the lowlands, which, besides the Lena, include the lower reaches of the Lena tributaries Vilyuy, Amga and Aldan. The entire length of the course of some of the large left tributaries of the Lena, such as the Lungkha, Tyugyuene, Sitte, Khanchaly and Kenkeme, falls wholly within the lowland area. These rivers are subject to spring floods during the thaw period and occasional rain floods in the summer. During the winter small rivers and rivulets freeze to the bottom. The largest lakes of the lowland are Nedzheli and Ulakhan-Kyuel.
Geology
Geologically the lowland roughly corresponds to the eastern, the lowest parts of the Vilyuy Syneclise. It is filled with Mesozoic deposits and Quaternary sands and loams, both of alluvial and eolian origin.
Climate and flora
The climate prevailing in the lowland is continental and harsh, characterized by a very low annual rainfall of barely per year. 70% to 80% of the precipitation falls in the summer, mostly in the form of rain. The average air temperature in January is a chilly . In July the average temperature is .
Most of the lowland is covered by taiga in which larch predominates. There are as well areas of birch forests, marshes and grassy meadows.

Gojko Kačar (, ; born 26 January 1987) is a former Serbian footballer who played as a midfielder.
Club career
Kačar played for Vojvodina's youth academy before being promoted to the first team. In January 2008, he moved to Germany to play for Hertha BSC for a fee of €3 million, which made him the most expensive player that Vojvodina ever sold.
On 21 August 2010, Kačar debuted for Hamburger SV, coming on as a substitute for Eljero Elia in the 79th minute of a 2–1 home win against Schalke.
After an unsuccessful stint in Japan playing for Cerezo Osaka, on 19 July 2016, Kačar left Hamburg to join FC Augsburg.
In August 2018, Kačar joined Cypriot club Anorthosis Famagusta. He retired in 2019.
International career
Kačar was called up to the Serbian U-21 team for the 2007 UEFA European Under-21 Football Championship in the Netherlands. He made his debut in a 0–2 loss to England, which was also his only match at the tournament.
On 7 September 2008, Kačar scored five goals for the Serbian U-21 team in an 8–0 demolition of Hungary in a qualifying match for the 2009 UEFA European Under-21 Football Championship. At the main tournament, he also scored once, but it was the only goal that Serbia ever scored.
Kačar represented Serbia at the 2008 Summer Olympics, making his debut against Australia on 7 August 2008, as well as the 2010 FIFA World Cup. He went on to make 25 appearances at senior level.
Personal life
Kačar's two uncles, Slobodan and Tadija, are Olympic medalists in boxing. Slobodan won a gold medal at the 1980 Summer Olympics, while Tadija won silver in 1976.

OH 24 (Olduvai Hominid № 24, nicknamed "Twiggy") is a fossilized skull of the species Homo habilis. It was discovered in Olduvai Gorge, Tanzania by Peter Nzube in 1968. The skull was found crushed almost flat and was therefore named after the famously skinny model of the time Twiggy. Estimated at about 1.8 mya (million years old), the cranium was found crushed flat and cemented together with a mass coating of limestone. It is now a Smithsonian exhibit item.
Originally, there was very little interest placed on the discovery of the skull, but after much effort by scientist Ron Clarke, the skull was finally reconstructed and examined thoroughly. Despite this effort, there still is a good deal of distortion from the fossilization processes that took place. The small cranial capacity estimated at about 590-600 cc (cubic centimeters) is in part attributed to this cranial distortion. OH 24's face is described as being prognathic (projecting forward under the nose), as in other fossils from the Homo habilis family, but not quite to the extent of earlier Australopithecus species. Besides manifesting lesser prognathism than the australopithecines, OH 24 also portrays a larger cranial vault, indicating an expansion in brain size from its ancestor, and the reduction of facial prognathisim typical of the evolution of early Homo.
The individual's third molars had erupted, which indicates that OH 24- "Twiggy" was an adult at death. Yet, these molars show no sign of wear (the points on the crowns of the teeth are still sharp, and show little sign of abrasion by rough food matter), indicating that this individual died soon after the eruption of these molars. Like the other fossils of Homo habilis, OH 24 also manifests the slightly small teeth set in a U-shaped arch.
Being one of the oldest fossils of Homo habilis, OH 24 has been used to settle many disputes about splitting some of the early Homo fossils that have been found into Homo rudolfensis and Homo habilis, or lumping them together into one single species, Homo habilis. Some of the highly disputed fossils are KNM-ER 1813 which most agree is a female Homo habilis and KNM-ER 1470 which many argue has various anatomical differences to the previously known Homo habilis fossils that should make it be classified into the Homo rudolfensis species.

Thermal hydraulics (also called thermohydraulics) is the study of hydraulic flow in thermal fluids. The area can be mainly divided into three parts: thermodynamics, fluid mechanics, and heat transfer, but they are often closely linked to each other. A common example is steam generation in power plants and the associated energy transfer to mechanical motion and the change of states of the water while undergoing this process. Thermal-hydraulic analysis can determine important parameters for reactor design such as plant efficiency and coolability of the system.
The common adjectives are "thermohydraulic", "thermal-hydraulic" and "thermalhydraulic".
Thermodynamic analysis
In the thermodynamic analysis, all states defined in the system are assumed to be in thermodynamic equilibrium; each state has mechanical, thermal, and phase equilibrium, and there is no macroscopic change with respect to time. For the analysis of the system, the first law and second law of thermodynamics can be applied.
In power plant analysis, a series of states can comprise a cycle. In this case, each state represents condition at the inlet/outlet of individual component. The example of components is pumpcompressor, turbine, reactor, and heat exchanger. By considering the constitutive equation for the given type of fluid, thermodynamic state of each point can be analyzed. As a result, the thermal efficiency of the cycle can be defined.
Examples of the cycle include the Carnot cycle, Brayton cycle, and Rankine cycle. Based on the simple cycle, modified or combined cycle also exists.
Temperature distribution
Temperature is an important quantity to know for the understanding of the system. Material properties such as density, thermal conductivity, viscosity, and specific heat depend on temperature, and very high or low temperature can bring unexpected changes in the system. In solid, the heat equation can be used to obtain the temperature distribution inside the material with given geometries.
For steady-state and static case, the heat equation can be written as
where Fourier's law of conduction is applied.
Applying boundary conditions gives a solution for the temperature distribution.
Single-phase heat transfer
In single-phase heat transfer, convection is often the dominant mechanism of heat transfer. For a diabatic flow where the flow receives heat, the temperature of the coolant changes as it flows. An example of single-phase heat transfer is a gas-cooled reactor and molten-salt reactor.
The most convenient way for characterizing the single-phase heat transfer is based on an empirical approach, where the temperature difference between the wall and bulk flow can be obtained from the heat transfer coefficient. The heat transfer coefficient depends on several factors: mode of heat transfer (e.g., internal or external flow), type of fluid, geometry of the system, flow regime (e.g., laminar or turbulent flow), boundary condition, etc.
Examples of heat transfer correlations are Dittus-Boelter correlation (turbulent forced convection), Churchill & Chu (natural convection).
Multi-phase heat transfer
Compared with single-phase heat transfer, heat transfer with a phase change is an effective way of heat transfer. It generally has high value of heat transfer coefficient due to the large value of latent heat of phase change followed by induced mixing of the flow. Boiling and condensation heat transfers are concerned with wide range of phenomena.
Pool boiling
Pool boiling is boiling at a stagnant fluid. Its behavior is well characterized by Nukiyama boiling curve, which shows the relation between the amount of surface superheat and applied heat flux on the surface. With the varying degrees of the superheat, the curve is composed of natural convection, onset of nucleate boiling, nucleate boiling, critical heat flux, transition boiling, and film boiling. Each regime has a different mechanism of heat transfer and has different correlation for heat transfer coefficient.
Flow boiling
Flow boiling is boiling at a flowing fluid. Compared with pool boiling, flow boiling heat transfer depends on many factors including flow pressure, mass flow rate, fluid type, upstream condition, wall materials, system geometry, and applied heat flux. Characterization of flow boiling requires comprehensive consideration of operating condition. In 2021 a prototype electric vehicle charging cable using flow boiling was able to remove 24.22 kW of heat, allowing the charging current to reach 2,400 amps, far higher than state of the art charging cables that top out at 520 amps.
Critical Heat Flux
Heat transfer coefficient due to nucleate boiling increases with wall superheat until they reach a certain point. When the applied heat flux exceeds the certain limit, heat transfer capability of the flow decreases or significantly drops. Normally, the critical heat flux corresponds to DNB in PWR and dryout in BWR. The reduced heat transfer coefficient seen in post-DNB or post-dryout is likely to result in damaging of the boiling surface. Understanding of the exact point and triggering mechanism related to critical heat flux is a topic of interest.
Post-CHF Heat transfer
For DNB type of boiling crisis, the flow is characterized by creeping vapor fluid between liquid and the wall. On top of the convective heat transfer, radiation heat transfer contributes to the heat transfer. After the dryout, the flow regime is shifted from an inverted annular to mist flow.
Other phenomena
Other thermal hydraulic phenomena are subject of interest:
Critical discharge
Counter current flow limitation
Condensation
Flow instability
Rewetting

The USCGC Courier (WAGR/WTR-410) was a cutter in the United States Coast Guard converted from the M/V Coastal Messenger a Maritime Commission Type C1-M-AV1 vessel.
M/V Coastal Messenger (1945–1952)
Originally launched in 1945 by Froemming Brothers of Milwaukee, Wisconsin as the M/V Coastal Messenger, the ship was to be originally named Doddridge but was changed prior to acceptance by the Maritime Administration. The ship was originally designed as an inter-island shuttle for military and naval cargoes. She was designed to receive cargo from much larger Victory and Liberty ships and then deliver it to U.S. forces on small outlying islands but was actually never used for that purpose due to the end of World War II. In the late-1940s, the M/V Coastal Messenger was operated by both the Standard Fruit & Steamship Company and Grace Line, Inc., primarily along the coasts to northern South America. On a trip to South America she ran aground at La Salina on Lake Maracaibo, Venezuela but was freed after 11 days with extensive, though minor, damage. She was then mothballed with the reserve fleet and transferred to the control of the Department of State in 1952.
USCGC Courier WAGR-410 (1952–1964)
The United States Coast Guard Cutter Courier was acquired as part of a joint operation between the United States Department of State and the United States Coast Guard to become a mobile transmitting facility for the U.S. Information Agency's "Voice of America" program. In response to an initiative, code-named Operation Vagabond, that was approved by President Harry S. Truman and the Joint Chiefs of Staff and announced by the Department of State in April, 1951, the operation was designed to provide a ship-borne radio relay station to transmit Voice of America programs behind the Iron Curtain. Such a vessel could move to any areas of trouble quickly, could serve as a temporary relay station as needed, and permit the use of a station where it was impractical to build a shore station. To ease political sensitivities, it was decided that the Coast Guard should operate the vessels, which in the planning stages were to have been a total of six vessels. Excessive costs kept the operation to a single vessel.
Commissioned on February 15, 1952 in Hoboken, New Jersey, Courier's call sign was "Vagabond-Able". For twelve years during the 1950s and 1960s, she served as a portion of the Voice of America radio network during the Cold War, at a time when the Soviet Union had attempted to jam portions of the network. The Courier contained the most powerful communications radio transmitter ever installed on board a ship, an RCA BT-105 150-kilowatt mediumwave transmitter, as well as two Collins 207B1 type 35-kilowatt shortwave transmitters as well as a Collins Radio Company 51J-type receiver.
President Harry S. Truman visited the Courier on March 4, 1952, when the ship docked in Washington, D.C. and he used the occasion to broadcast a major policy speech beamed at Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union.
On April 18, 1952, during the Courier's shakedown cruise to the Panama Canal Zone, using the call sign KU2XAJ, tests were performed at 1700–2300 on 6110 and 9690 kc. shortwave (35 kW), and 1510 kc. medium wave (150 kW). The broadcasts closed with the playing of the Panamanian National Anthem and the Star Spangled Banner. The Courier initially used a $18,000 35' × 69' barrage balloon that held the medium wave antennae aloft. The Courier carried 5 of these balloons, but on more than one occasion the balloon broke free. Eventually it was decided to replace the balloon with a mast-supported wire antenna.
The Courier also held the record for longest deployment overseas - from 17 July 1952 to 13 August 1964, she spent no time in the United States territorial waters being stationed instead off the island of Rhodes, Greece during that time.
Courier was decommissioned on 25 August 1964 upon her return to Yorktown, Virginia and turned over to the Coast Guard Reserve Training Center at Yorktown, Virginia. Placed in "out of commission, in Reserve" status, beginning July 1, 1965, Courier provided dockside training in merchant marine safety and dangerous cargo handling for the next year.
USCGC Courier WTR-410 (1966–1972)
The USCGC Courier WTR-410 was recommissioned into the Coast Guard at Yorktown, Virginia on 30 April 1966. Here the Courier's mission was to serve as a mobile operational training platform with qualified personnel attached and to aid by giving guidance during operational Port Security training at various sites during two week active duty for training periods. The Courier's area of operation covered the East Coast, the Gulf of Mexico, and the Great Lakes.
In June 1970 the suffered damage to her bow after colliding with the Courier, who also suffered bow damage in the Chesapeake Bay.
The Courier's homeport remained the Reserve Training Center in Yorktown and she finished her Coast Guard career as a training vessel for reservists. She carried accommodations for 220 trainees, patrol boats, and communication equipment. Her small boats were used to train reservists in harbor patrols while her cargo handling equipment was employed to train reservists in handling dangerous cargoes.
USCGC Courier 410-WAGR/WTR was decommissioned in 1972 and scrapped in 1977.
Pirate radio inspiration
It has sometimes been claimed that the Courier's offshore broadcasts directly inspired such offshore pirate radio stations as Radio Mercur and Radio Caroline. A balloon-raised antenna similar to that used by the Courier was also attempted by the pirate Laser 558 in 1984, with similar results.
Notable accomplishments
Contained the most powerful communications radio transmitter ever installed on board a ship.
Longest deployment overseas - from 17 July 1952 to 13 August 1964.

Roxithromycin is a semi-synthetic macrolide antibiotic. It is used to treat respiratory tract, urinary and soft tissue infections. Roxithromycin is derived from erythromycin, containing the same 14-membered lactone ring. However, an N-oxime side chain is attached to the lactone ring. It is also currently undergoing clinical trials for the treatment of male-pattern hair loss.
It was patented in 1980 and approved for medical use in 1987. Roxithromycin is available under several brandnames. Roxithromycin is not available in the United States. Roxithromycin is available in Australia, France, Germany, Israel, South Korea and New Zealand. Roxithromycin has also been tested to possess antimalarial activity.
Side effects
Most common side effects are gastrointestinal; diarrhoea, nausea, abdominal pain and vomiting. Less common side effects include central or peripheral nervous system events such as headaches, dizziness, vertigo, and also the rarely seen rashes, abnormal liver function values and alteration in senses of smell and taste.
Drug interactions
Roxithromycin has fewer interactions than erythromycin as it has a lower affinity for cytochrome P450.
Roxithromycin does not interact with hormonal contraceptives, prednisolone, carbamazepine, ranitidine or antacids.
When roxithromycin is administered with theophylline, some studies have shown an increase in the plasma concentration of theophylline. A change in dosage is usually not required but patients with high levels of theophylline at the start of the treatment should have their plasma levels monitored.
Roxithromycin appears to interact with warfarin. This is shown by an increase in prothrombin time and/or international normalised ratio (INR) in patients taking roxithromycin and warfarin concurrently. As a consequence, severe bleeding episodes have occurred.
Available forms
Roxithromycin is commonly available as tablets or oral suspension.
Mechanism of action
Roxithromycin prevents bacteria from growing, by interfering with their protein synthesis. Roxithromycin binds to the subunit 50S of the bacterial ribosome, and thus inhibits the synthesis of peptides. Roxithromycin has similar antimicrobial spectrum as erythromycin, but is more effective against certain gram-negative bacteria, particularly Legionella pneumophila.
Pharmacokinetics
When taken before a meal, roxithromycin is very rapidly absorbed, and diffuses into most tissues and phagocytes. Due to the high concentration in phagocytes, roxithromycin is actively transported to the site of infection. During active phagocytosis, large concentrations of roxithromycin are released.
Metabolism
Only a small portion of roxithromycin is metabolised. Most of roxithromycin is secreted unchanged into the bile and some in expired air. Under 10% is excreted into the urine. Roxithromycin's half-life is 12 hours.
History
French pharmaceutical company Roussel Uclaf first marketed roxithromycin in 1987.

The Rheinwaldhorn () is the highest point in the Swiss canton of Ticino at 3,402 metres above sea level. It lies on the border between the cantons of Graubünden and Ticino, in the Adula massif, part of the St. Gotthard massif of the Lepontine Alps in southern Switzerland.
The mountain is known under different names, Rheinwaldhorn, Adula or Piz Valrhein. The group of the snowy peaks lying between the two principal branches of the Rhine were known in the Middle Ages by the names Mons Aquila or Mons Avium. From the Romansh form of the first comes the name Adula, which is used to designate the north-eastern portion of the Lepontine Alps. The German name "Rheinwaldhorn" comes from the Rheinwald region.
Geography
The Rheinwaldhorn is the culminating point of the eastern portion of the Lepontine Alps and the Adula group. In this area, the watershed between the Rhine and the Po river has no determinate direction, and exhibits a dislocated appearance. The peaks of the Adula form an irregular group, all the highest lying in a cluster not more five kilometres distant from the centre, which may be fixed as the foot of the Rheinwald Glacier. From the central group a considerable range extends due south more than 15 kilometres, between Val Blenio and Val Calanca, gradually diminishing in height. A parallel ridge connected with the main massif divides the Val Calanca from Val Mesocco; it surpasses but in few points the height of 9,000 feet. The northern ridge, longer but less regular than the first-mentioned, extends fully 20 kilometres, from the central group to the Piz Nadils over Sumvitg in the valley of the Vorderrhein.
The valleys on the north-east side are significantly higher than those on the south-west side. About 7 km west of the Rheinwaldhorn are the localities of Dangio and Torre (Ticino), at around 800 metres above sel level. About 13 km east of the summit is the locality of Hinterrhein (Graubünden), at around 1,600 metres.
Politically, the summit of the Rheinwaldhorn is split between two cantons and three municipalities. On the west side is the municipality of Blenio (Ticino) and on the east side are the municipalities of Vals and Hinterrhein (Graubünden).
Climbing history
The summit of the Rheinwaldhorn was first reached in 1789 by Placidus a Spescha. For seventy years no attempts seems to have been made to repeat the ascent. In 1859, Weilenmann reached the summit alone. The next and third recorded ascent was made in 1861 by Coaz (a topographer who made the first ascent of Piz Bernina), with three companions, and a chamois-hunter named Peter Anton Jellier, of Vals. Coaz gave an account of the expedition in the Jahresbericht der Naturforschenden Gesellschaft Graubünden. Sleeping at the Zapport Alps, they mounted to the spot named Paradies, located below the Paradies Glacier. A faint sheep-tract was followed for some distance: they then took to the glacier, but after some time returned to its southern bank. The first stage of the ascent was completed when they gained the col (Lenta Pass) in the ridge between the Rheinwaldhorn and Güferhorn. From thence the way lay along the arête. This was very narrow, and in some places difficult, where steep rocks projected through the névé. After overcoming the rocks, the travellers found the ridge wider, but also much steeper than below, and to reach the highest point it was necessary to wind round the north side of the peak, so that the final climb was made from the north-west. The summit is a ridge about 200 feet long, running from north to south, and in one part bare of snow. Here in the two following ascents were found some remains of the cairn erected there seventy years before by Placidus a Spescha.
The peaks of the Adula group had not been frequented by foreign travellers until 1863, when Morshead made the first ascent of the Vogelberg. In the following year Freshfield, with two friends, reached the summit of the Rheinwaldhorn from the side of the Lenta Glacier, striking the shoulder of the peak above the lowest point in the ridge connecting it with the Güferhorn.
The first winter solo ascent was made by Daniele Gianora in 1942.

Tygert Burton "Ty" Pennington (born Gary Tygert Burton) is an American television host, artist, carpenter, author, and former model and actor.
His rise to prominence began with his role as carpenter on the TLC home improvement reality show Trading Spaces (2000–2003), and continued when he hosted the ABC reality series Extreme Makeover: Home Edition (2003–2012), where he won two Primetime Emmy Awards. Following the show's conclusion in 2012, Pennington has focused on numerous other projects, including host of ABC's short lived talk show The Revolution in 2012, TNT's On the Menu opposite Emeril Lagasse in 2014 and The Food Network's American Diner Revival opposite Amanda Freitag from 2015 to 2016. On September 13, 2017, it was announced that Pennington was joining the revival of Trading Spaces, which began airing on April 7, 2018, on TLC.
Early life
Pennington was born Gary Tygert Burton, the son of Yvonne Vickery. Yvonne separated from Ty's father when he and his older brother Wynn were very young, and spent several years as a single parent before she remarried. Her new husband adopted both boys, giving them his surname Pennington. Ty is of partial Cherokee descent.
Education
A self-described "Jack of all trades", Pennington learned woodworking early in life and began teaching himself about carpentry and home improvement. After attending Sprayberry High School in Marietta, Georgia, he first attended Kennesaw State University, where he majored in art and history. He paid his way through college by taking night classes and working during the day, first working in landscaping before moving into construction. Despite his skills in carpentry, Pennington initially decided that carpentry wasn't something he wanted to do professionally, noting his main interests were in becoming an artist, specializing in Graphic Design. On the advice of one of his professors, he transferred to the Art Institute of Atlanta, from where he graduated with a bachelor's degree in graphic design.
Career
Modeling
During his final semester, Pennington was approached by a modeling scout, and soon began a lucrative career in that field. He landed print jobs for J.Crew, Swatch and Sprite, and appeared in television spots for Diet Coke, Levi's, Macy's and Bayer, among others. His job as a model took him to places all over the world, as he went on to reside in Japan, Thailand, Italy, Canada, and Germany.
Television
Pennington parlayed his hands-on skills and design acumen into a career in the entertainment industry, becoming a set designer, including for Leaving Las Vegas in 1995. However, his professional breakthrough came through The Learning Channel's (now known as simply TLC) innovative hit show Trading Spaces. In 2003, he acted in the independent film, The Adventures of Ociee Nash (as "Wilbur Wright").
In 2003, when ABC began developing a show that would rehab the homes of deserving families in seven days or less, Pennington was chosen as the leader of the eight-person design team. Extreme Makeover: Home Edition, originally planned to be a 13-part special, became a huge hit, catapulting Pennington to stardom. This led to an endorsement deal with Sears, a sponsor of the show. Pennington was extremely dedicated to the show, spending on average 240 days of the year working, and was known to have fought off anything from pulled muscles to heatstroke to food poisoning to keep doing his job. He stated that his career on the show resulted in the channel's commissioning Ty's Great British Adventure, in which he worked with communities including Portreath, Cornwall (UK) to restore a run-down town park in a week and Portishead, North Somerset (UK) to renovate the town's derelict outdoor pool into a community-run Lido. The series was shown from September 16, 2008.
When Extreme Makeover Home Edition ended in 2012 with its ninth season, Pennington had helped rebuild more than 200 homes for the show. Afterwards, Pennington relocated from Los Angeles to New York City, where he was cast to take part in the lifestyle-based talk show The Revolution, which aired on ABC in January 2012. When the show was cancelled after six months, Ty began pursuing other goals.
In January 2021, HGTV debuted Ty Breaker, a show that features Pennington helping families struggling to make their homes work for their changing lives.
Pennington joined the HGTV renovation competition series, Rock The Block, as host for its 2nd season, which premiered on March 8, 2021, and continues in that role for season 3, set to launch in early 2022.
Other work
Prior to his partnership with Sears, Pennington was the owner and designer of his company, Furniture Unlimited, based in Atlanta and Los Angeles. He also lends his name to Sears, with their design team guiding the design of every item in the Ty Pennington Style line of bedding, tabletop items, bath accessories, furniture, patio furniture, and other miscellaneous home decor.
Pennington published Ty's Tricks: Home Repair Secrets Plus Cheap and Easy Projects to Transform Any Room (2003), a do-it-yourself guide on home improvement. On May 15, 2007, he released the first issue of his quarterly magazine Ty Pennington at Home, which ran until 2009.
On July 25, 2008, he announced a 3-year partnership with Marketplace Events, the largest organizer of consumer remodeling, home decor and gardening shows in North America.
He appeared on an episode of Wow! Wow! Wubbzy! playing a fictionalized version of himself named Ty Ty The Tool Guy.
In September 2008, Pennington became the spokesperson for Abbott Nutrition and their baby formula packaging innovation called Similac SimplePac. He was also involved with the Similac Custom Nursery Design Contest and Ty's Nursery Guide that were part of the new product marketing.
In September 2011, Pennington appeared in an episode of Disney's Take Two With Phineas and Ferb.
In February 2014, Pennington became the spokesperson for Guaranteed Rate and has been featured in a series of commercials and ads for the Chicago-based mortgage lender.
ADHD
As a child, Pennington was plagued with behavioral problems until he was diagnosed with ADHD at the age of 17. He also discussed his ADHD with Glenn Beck and in the movie The Disruptors. Pennington has partnered with Shire Plc to raise awareness of ADHD in adults and promote the use of Vyvanse for the treatment of adult ADHD. He has been criticized for promoting the use of ADHD medications such as Adderall without disclosing his sponsorship.
Personal life
Pennington was arrested for DUI in Los Angeles on May 5, 2007 with a blood alcohol content of .14 percent. He faced 6 months in jail. He pleaded guilty and was sentenced to 3 years probation. In July 2021, Pennington announced his engagement to his girlfriend of one year, Kellee Merrell. They got married on November 27, 2021 in Savannah, Georgia.

The Byzantine Catholic Archeparchy of Pittsburgh () is a Ruthenian Greek Catholic Church ecclesiastical territory or archeparchy of the Catholic Church that serves portions of the Eastern United States. Its territory covers the states of Alabama, Arkansas, Commonwealth of Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Texas, and West Virginia. The current archbishop is the Most Reverend William C. Skurla, whose is resident in the archepiscopal see of Pittsburgh, Allegheny, Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.
The Archeparchy of Pittsburgh is a metropolitan see with three suffragan eparchies and one exarchate in its ecclesiastical province: the Eparchies of Parma, Passaic, Phoenix, and the Exarchate of Toronto.
History
Exarchate
In 1924, the church had been established by the Holy See as an exarchate, known as the '"Apostolic Exarchate of Pittsburgh for Faithful of the Oriental Rite (Ruthenian)'". Exarchate is an ecclesiastical term which indicates a "missionary diocese" or territory.
This move separated the Ruthenian Greek Catholic Church in the United States into two distinct groups: one for those originating from Galicia (in modern-day Ukraine) with its see in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and the other for those who were from the Carpathian Mountain region (in modern-day Ukraine and Slovakia), as well as those from Hungary and Croatia. In time, the two groups would come to be known as Ukrainian Greek Catholics and Ruthenian Byzantine Catholics, respectively.
(Arch)Eparchy
The Exarchate of Pittsburgh was elevated to the status of an eparchy in 1963.
Byzantine Catholics in the United States were given sui iuris (self-governing) status as a Metropolia (archdiocese) by Pope Paul VI in 1969. Archbishop Stephen Kocisko was installed as the first Metropolitan-Archbishop on June 11, 1969, at Holy Spirit Church in Oakland (Pittsburgh). He was the first prelate in the history of people from the Subcarpathian Rus region (of present-day Ukraine and Slovakia) to hold this rank.
Operations
The seat of the Archeparchy is the St. John the Baptist Byzantine Catholic Cathedral in Munhall, Pennsylvania, a suburb of Pittsburgh.
The Archeparchy of Pittsburgh also operates SS. Cyril and Methodius Byzantine Catholic Seminary in the North Side section of the city, for the training of candidates for the priesthood and diaconate, cantors and those in other ministries. Established in 1950 by Bishop Daniel Ivancho, the seminary serves all four eparchies of the Byzantine Catholic Metropolitan Church of Pittsburgh.
Parishes
, the Archeparchy has 85 parishes under its canonical jurisdiction.
The majority of the archepachy's parishes are located in Western Pennsylvania, particularly in the Pittsburgh and Johnstown metropolitan areas.
Although most Ohio parishes are under the jurisdiction of the Byzantine Catholic Eparchy of Parma, 5 churches in metropolitan Youngstown and 5 churches in Ohio River communities are governed by the archeparchy.
Additionally, there are churches in the following states: Louisiana (1), Tennessee (1), Texas (4), and West Virginia (2).

The current chancery office and residency is on 66 Riverview Avenue, Pittsburgh.

The People's Federal Savings and Loan Association is a historic bank building at 101 East Court Street in Sidney, Ohio, designed by Chicago architect Louis Sullivan. It was designed and built in 1917 for use by Peoples Federal Savings and Loan Association, which still operates out of it. It is one of a handful of banks designed by Sullivan between 1908 and 1919 for small communities in the central United States. The building is a National Historic Landmark.
Description and history
People's Federal Savings and Loan Association is located at 101 East Court Street on the corner of South Ohio Street in Sidney across from the Spot restaurant. It lies also across the street from the Gothic revival Monumental Building and the Second Empire-style Shelby County Courthouse. Numerous colors adorn the building, beginning with the corbels of multicolored terracotta, which are placed over the front windows. A dominant Romanesque Revival archway forms the main entrance, set in a building base of black marble and amid walls of strong reds. Other parts of the walls are pierced by numerous windows featuring blue, green, and purple glasswork. The design is the result of Sullivan's architectural ideal: simple structurally but ornately decorated in their details.
The Sidney People's Federal Savings and Loan Association was one of a series of commissions that architect Louis Sullivan took on late in his career. These commissions resulted in a collection of bank buildings that have been termed "jewel boxes" for their modest size and ornate appearance. According to one account of the creation of Sullivan's design, he produced a sketch of it after two days of observing the empty lot where it was to stand. The sketch was at first rejected by the bank directors, who expressed a desire for a more conventional design with Classical features. Sullivan observed that they could have hired any of "a thousand architects to design a classic bank", but that only he could produce this type of design. The building was completed for $1,000 less than Sullivan's estimated cost.

Type II Cepheids are variable stars which pulsate with periods typically between 1 and 50 days. They are population II stars: old, typically metal-poor, low mass objects.
Like all Cepheid variables, Type IIs exhibit a relationship between the star's luminosity and pulsation period, making them useful as standard candles for establishing distances where little other data is available
Longer period Type II Cepheids, which are more luminous, have been detected beyond the Local Group in the galaxies NGC 5128 and NGC 4258.
Classification
Historically Type II Cepheids were called W Virginis variables, but are now divided into three subclasses based on the length of their period. Stars with periods between 1 and 4 days are of the BL Herculis subclass and 10–20 days belong to the W Virginis subclass. Stars with periods greater than 20 days, and usually alternating deep and shallow minima, belong to the RV Tauri subclass. RV Tauri variables are usually classified by a formal period from deep minimum to deep minimum, hence 40 days or more.
The divisions between the types are not always clearcut or agreed. For example, the dividing line between BL Her and W Vir types is quoted at anything between 4 and 10 days, with no obvious division between the two. RV Tau variables may not have obvious alternating minima, while some W Vir stars do. Nevertheless, each type is thought to represent a distinct different evolutionary stage, with BL Her stars being helium core burning objects moving from the horizontal branch towards the asymptotic giant branch (AGB), W Vir stars undergoing hydrogen or helium shell burning on a blue loop, and RV Tau stars being post-AGB objects at or near the end of nuclear fusion.
RV Tau stars in particular show irregularities in their light curves, with slow variations in the brightness of both maxima and minima, variations in the period, intervals with little variation, and sometimes a temporary breakdown into chaotic behaviour. R Scuti has one of the most irregular light curves.
Properties
The physical properties of all the type II Cepheid variables are very poorly known. For example, it is expected that they have masses near or below that of the Sun, but there are few examples of reliable known masses.
Period-luminosity relationship
Type II Cepheids are fainter than their classical Cepheid counterparts for a given period by about 1.6 magnitudes. Cepheid variables are used to establish the distance to the Galactic Center, globular clusters, and galaxies.
Examples
Type II Cepheids are not as well known as their type I counterparts, with only a couple of naked eye examples. In this list, the period quoted for RV Tauri variables is the interval between successive deep minima, hence twice the comparable period for the other sub-types.

Benzyl benzoate is an organic compound which is used as a medication and insect repellent. As a medication it is used to treat scabies and lice. For scabies either permethrin or malathion is typically preferred. It is applied to the skin as a lotion. Typically two to three applications are needed. It is also present in Balsam of Peru, Tolu balsam, and in a number of flowers.
Side effects may include irritation of the skin. It is not recommended in children. It is also used in other animals; however, it is considered toxic to cats. How it works is unclear.
Benzyl benzoate was first studied medically in 1918. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. Benzyl benzoate is sold under the brand name Scabanca among others and is available as a generic medication. It is not available for medical use in the United States.
Uses
Medical
Benzyl benzoate is an effective and inexpensive topical treatment for human scabies. It has vasodilating and spasmolytic effects and is present in much asthma and whooping cough drugs. It is also used as an excipient in some testosterone-replacement medications (like Nebido) for treating hypogonadism.
Benzyl benzoate is used as a topical acaricide, scabicide, and pediculicide in veterinary hospitals.
Non-medical
Benzyl benzoate is used as a repellent for chiggers, ticks, and mosquitoes. It is also used as a dye carrier, solvent for cellulose derivatives, plasticizer, and fixative in the perfume industry.
Side effects
Benzyl benzoate has low acute toxicity in laboratory animals. It is rapidly hydrolyzed to benzoic acid and benzyl alcohol. Benzyl alcohol is subsequently metabolized to benzoic acid. The conjugates of benzoic acid (hippuric acid and the glucuronide of benzoic acid) are rapidly eliminated in urine. When given in large doses to laboratory animals, benzyl benzoate can cause hyperexcitation, loss of coordination, ataxia, convulsions, and respiratory paralysis.
Benzyl benzoate can be a skin irritant when used as a topical scabicide. Overdose can result in blistering and hives or a rash can occur as an allergic reaction.
As an excipient in some testosterone-replacement injectable medications, benzyl benzoate has been reported as a cause of anaphylaxis in a case in Australia. Bayer includes this report in information for health professionals and recommends that physicians "should be aware of the potential for serious allergic reactions" to preparations of this type. In Australia, reports to ADRAC, which evaluates reports of adverse drug reactions for the Therapeutic Goods Administration, show several reports of allergic issues since the anaphylaxis case from 2011.
Chemistry
It is an organic compound with the formula C6H5CH2O2CC6H5. It is the ester of benzyl alcohol and benzoic acid. It forms either a viscous liquid or solid flakes and has a weak, sweet-balsamic odor. It occurs in a number of blossoms (e. g. tuberose, hyacinth) and is a component of Balsam of Peru and Tolu balsam.
Production
Benzyl benzoate is produced industrially by the reaction of sodium benzoate with benzyl chloride in the presence of a base, or by transesterification of methyl benzoate and benzyl alcohol. It is a byproduct of benzoic acid synthesis by toluene oxidation. It can also be synthesized by the Tishchenko reaction, using benzaldehyde with sodium benzyloxide (generated from sodium and benzyl alcohol) as catalyst:

This article is on the Guthrie Township. For information on the town of Guthrie, within the township, see Guthrie, Missouri.
Guthrie Township is one of eighteen townships in Callaway County, Missouri, USA. As of the 2010 census, its population was 604.
Guthrie Township has the name of a local family.
History
The town of Guthrie was established in 1872 as 'Bigbee' and then renamed 'Guthrie' in 1874.(See Missouri State Historical Society page on Callaway County place names.) The larger Guthrie Township surrounding the town of the same name was created sometime between 1883 and 1897 from what was before then approximately the southern one-third of Round Prairie Township (reduced in size thereafter), plus a narrow adjacent strip of northern Cedar Township. This is critical to determining exact locations in historical and genealogical research.
Geography
Guthrie Township covers an area of and while containing no incorporated settlements, it does include the unincorporated community of Guthrie (named Bigbee at time of its establishment). The stream of Dry Fork runs through this township, where the removal of the Chicago & Alton Railroad tracks and station affected the community substantially, and the community was absorbed largely into the economy of nearby New Bloomfield in neighboring Cedar Township.

Ted M. Warshafsky (December 6, 1926 – October 14, 2012) was a personal injury lawyer and activist best known for establishing the successful Warshafsky Law Firm in Milwaukee, Wisconsin and nominating Julian Bond as the first African American major-party candidate for Vice President of the United States.
Early life
The son of two immigrants, Ted Warshafsky was born in St. Louis, Missouri to Ida and Israel Warshafsky. His parents divorced by the time he turned 4 years old. When Warshafsky turned 18, he joined the Marines and later attended the University of Wisconsin Law School on the GI Bill. Warshafsky later lived on the upper east side of Milwaukee in the Murray Hill neighborhood after graduating from college. He went on to build a reputation for winning multi-million dollar lawsuits, mostly against big name drug companies. During his professional career, he spent his time in both local and national politics.
Politics
1967 – Warshafsky encouraged his children to be actively involved in the protests of segregation in Milwaukee schools and would have them join him on a march with Father James Groppi in support of an open housing ordinance.
1968 – Serving as a field finance director on Eugene McCarthy's presidential campaign team, Warshafsky would also be the vice chairman of McCarthy's delegation and went on to nominate Julian Bond for Vice President at the Democratic National Convention of the same year.
1989 – Warshafsky filed a personal suit against ExxonMobil following the Valdez oil spill on behalf of the fish and wildlife of Alaska.
2008 – During John Edwards' Presidential campaign, Warshafsky would make donations to support his push for an end to poverty, providing universal health care, ending the war in Iraq, and fighting global warming.
Warshafsky Law Firm
After leaving law school, Ted M. Warshafsky struggled to find footing in the legal world until he founded the Warshafsky Law Firm. Based out of Wisconsin, Warshafsky Law Firm has grown to be one of the largest law firms in the Milwaukee area. In competition with firms such as Foley and Lardner LLP and Michael Best & Friedrich LLP, Warshafsky Law Firm has a history of specializing in personal injury and medical malpractice cases.
Lawsuits
1976 – Warshafsky Law Firm wins the biggest personal injury lawsuit settlement in Wisconsin history, up to this point in time. General Motors was sued after a young girl suffered brain damage as the result of a faulty GM part in a car crash. General Motors made an appeal, which Warshafsky followed by accepting a $3 million agreement.
1987 – Wyeth Laboratories was challenged by Warshafsky in a lawsuit regarding another young girl's brain damage, this time caused by the DPT vaccine. Once the lawsuit was filed and persecuted, Ted Warshafsky won the case with a $15 million victory for the parents of the injured girl.
2007 – Warshafsky went to the Wisconsin Supreme Court in an attempt to re-open a class-action lawsuit against American motorcycle manufacturer Harley-Davidson, accusing the company of failing to inform consumers of a defect in two engine types they sold during the years 1999 and 2000.
2009 – Continuing to seek justice, Warshafsky fought for the release of medical records from the American Association of Neurological Surgeons following a $2.9 million malpractice payout, made without a confidentiality agreement. In this case, Warshafsky believed secrecy would put the public at risk and actively worked to spread the word about the payout.
Book Series
While developing his professional career with Warshafsky Law Firm, Ted M. Warshafsky wrote a book series with his colleague called The Trial Handbook for Wisconsin Lawyers. This collection contained multiple volumes of information regarding issues of Wisconsin civil and criminal law. Printed by Lawyers Cooperative Publishing, the series of guides gives readers instruction, information, and advice for legal cases and trials, including how lawyers should conduct themselves during trials, how to handle circumstantial evidence, and the course of actions one should take once a final judgement has been made by the court.
Philanthropy
The Warshafsky Law Firm reflects the advocacy and passion Ted M. Warshafsky has always had for helping communities. The Warshafsky Law Firm formed a charitable foundation, known as Venice Arts, to distribute scholarships to young people in Milwaukee who are needy and deserving. Many groups are supported through donations made by Warshafsky Law Firm, including the Holton Street YMCA, Pearls for Girls, and the Southern Poverty Law Center.
Acknowledgements
In 2008, Ted M. Warshafsky was included in the Wisconsin Super Lawyers and received a Lifetime Achievement Award of Wisconsin Leaders in Law from the Wisconsin Law Journal. Later in 2009, Warshafsky was also selected as one of the top 100 lawyers in Wisconsin by the State Bar of Wisconsin and was recognized by the American Association for Justice as being one of the top 100 trial lawyers in the United States.
During his lifetime, Warshafsky served as a member and diplomat for a number of professional associations, including the American Board of Trial Lawyers, the American College of Trial Lawyers, the International Academy of Trial Lawyers, the New Democratic Coalition, and the International Society of Barristers. Ted M. Warshafsky also gave time as the national secretary for the Association of Trial Lawyers of America and as President of both the Wisconsin Academy of Trial Lawyers and Trial Lawyers Doing Public Justice.
Illness and Death
After suffering from a stroke in November 2011, Warshafsky died on October 14, 2012, at the age of 85, in his Jefferson County home.

The 2013 season was the Miami Dolphins' 44th in the National Football league (NFL) and their 48th overall. The season concluded with the Dolphins finishing third in the AFC East division with an 8–8 record, and no postseason play for the fifth consecutive season. The Dolphins allowed a league-high 58 sacks.
The Dolphins entered the season under second-year head coach Joe Philbin.
Personnel changes
Logo change
During the 2012 season, speculation about the Dolphins updating their current logo, which was introduced during the 1997 season, began during a conference call with season-ticket holders; as owner Stephen Ross and CEO Mike Dee eagerly agreed with a fan on the potential changing of the logo. On December 26, 2012, via Dolphins CEO Mike Dee's Twitter account, Dee unofficially announced that a logo change would take place, but the team was still considering different designs; and an official announcement would be provided sometime before the 2013 NFL Draft.
On March 27, 2013, following an accidental leaking of the new Dolphins logo on NFL.com, Dee confirmed in a press conference that the leaked image, as seen on NFL.com, was in fact the new official logo. This announcement came almost a month premature to the scheduled release date of the logo on April 25.

The Miami Dolphins entered the 2013 off-season with an estimated $45 million in salary cap space, third most among other teams, to retain the contracts of impending unrestricted free agents: running back Reggie Bush, safety Chris Clemons, tight end Anthony Fasano, wide receiver Brian Hartline, offensive tackle Jake Long, quarterback Matt Moore, cornerback Sean Smith and defensive tackle Randy Starks. As well as any future free agent signings, and 2013 NFL Draft picks.
On March 4, 2013, the Dolphins placed their franchise tag on defensive tackle Randy Starks, and Starks signed the franchise tender on March 20. The move kept Starks from becoming an unrestricted free agent and guaranteed him $8.45 million from the $3.72 million earned during the 2012 season.
On March 8, 2013, coming off his best career season, wide receiver Brian Hartline signed a new five-year contract for an estimated $31 million to remain with the Dolphins. Hartline's agent Drew Rosenhaus believed Hartline could have received more money in the open market, but decided to take a discount to remain a Dolphin. Shortly after, it was reported that quarterback Matt Moore signed a new two-year contract for an estimated $8 million, and should continue to play a backup role behind second year quarterback Ryan Tannehill.
When the NFL free agency period began at 4 p.m. EST on March 12, 2013, former Pittsburgh Steelers wide receiver Mike Wallace, who was viewed as the top free agent prospect of the 2013 offseason by many analysts, signed a five-year contract for an estimated $60 million. The Dolphins signed former Baltimore Ravens linebacker Dannell Ellerbe to a five-year deal worth an estimated $35 million, and former Oakland Raiders linebacker Philip Wheeler to a five-year deal worth an estimated $26 million. Subsequently, Miami released veteran linebackers Karlos Dansby and Kevin Burnett. While safety Chris Clemons re-signed a one-year contract to remain a Dolphin, and unrestricted free agent Anthony Fasano, who had spent the last five seasons in Miami, signed a four-year deal with the Kansas City Chiefs.
On March 13, 2013, it was reported that Reggie Bush had signed a four-year $16 million contract to play for the Detroit Lions.
On March 15, 2013, cornerback Sean Smith decided to part ways from the Dolphins and signed a new three-year contract with the Kansas City Chiefs. Former New York Jets tight end Dustin Keller signed a new one-year contract, worth an estimated $4.25 million, and former St. Louis Rams wide receiver Brandon Gibson signed a new three-year contract with the Dolphins.
Former Dolphins 2008 first round draft pick, offensive tackle Jake Long, after courting offers from various teams, signed a new four-year contract, worth an estimated $34 million, with the St. Louis Rams on March 18, 2013.
On March 30, 2013, cornerback Brent Grimes signed a one-year $5.5 million year with the Dolphins.
On October 22, 2013, the Dolphins acquired offensive tackle Bryant McKinnie from the Baltimore Ravens for a conditional late round pick.
2013 draft class
The 2013 National Football League Draft was held from April 25–27 in the Radio City Music Hall in New York City.
Notes
The Dolphins traded their first- (No. 12 overall) and original second- (No. 42 overall) round selections to the Oakland Raiders in exchange for the Raiders' first-round selection (No. 3 overall).
The Dolphins acquired this second-round selection in a trade that sent cornerback Vontae Davis to the Indianapolis Colts.
The Dolphins previously acquired an additional third-round selection — No. 82 overall — as part of a March 2012 trade that sent wide receiver Brandon Marshall to the Chicago Bears. The Dolphins later traded the No. 82 selection to the New Orleans Saints in exchange for two fourth-round selections from the Saints — Nos. 106 and 109 overall. The No. 109 selection, along with the Dolphins' original fifth-round selection (No. 146 overall) and one of their seventh-round selections (No. 224 overall — previously acquired in a July 2012 trade that sent guard Ryan Cook to the Dallas Cowboys), were traded to the Green Bay Packers in exchange for one of the Packers' third-round selections (No. 93 overall).
The Dolphins acquired these fourth- and fifth-round selections in a trade that sent wide receiver Davone Bess the team's original fourth- and seventh-round selections (Nos. 111 and 217 overall, respectively) to the Cleveland Browns.
Compensatory selection.
The Dolphins did not have a selection in the sixth round. The team traded their sixth-round selection (No. 180 overall) along with fourth- and sixth-round selections from the 2012 NFL Draft to the San Francisco 49ers in exchange for the 49ers' 2012 fourth-round selection.

Week 3: vs. Atlanta Falcons
The Dolphins went home for their season opener against the Falcons. The Falcons got off to a fast start as Matt Ryan found Jason Snelling on a 7-yard TD pass for a 7-0 lead the only score of the 1st quarter. They would make it 10-0 when Matt Bryant kicked a 52-yard field goal. The Dolphins got on the board when Daniel Thomas ran for a 5-yard TD coming within 3, 10-7.

The Falcons moved ahead in the 4th quarter as Bryant kicked a 33-yard field goal for a 23-20 lead but the Dolphins later on would score the game-winning TD when Tannehill found Dion Sims on a 1-yard pass for a final score of 27-23.
With the win, the Dolphins improved to 3-0.
Week 4: at New Orleans Saints
The Dolphins would suffer their first loss of the season as they lost to the New Orleans Saints 38-17 on Monday Night Football and failed to earn their first 4-0 start since 1995.
Week 5: vs. Baltimore Ravens
Miami would miss a field goal with less than a minute remaining. The miss doomed the Dolphins, as they lost to Baltimore 26-23 in a shootout game.
With the loss, Miami fell to 3-2.
Week 7: vs. Buffalo Bills
With their third straight loss, Miami fell to 3-3 after starting 3-0.
Week 8: at New England Patriots
With the loss, the Dolphins fell to 3-4.
Week 9: vs. Cincinnati Bengals
The Dolphins would force four turnovers in this game as they beat Cincinnati 22-20 in overtime on Thursday Night Football. The game ended with a safety in overtime on a sack on Andy Dalton in the end zone by Cameron Wake. It was the first time since Adewale Ogunleye tackled Fred Miller in Miller's own end zone on November 14, 2004, a game ended on a safety in overtime.
With the win, the Dolphins evened their record at 4-4.
Week 10: at Tampa Bay Buccaneers
Tampa Bay came into this game having not won a game, at 0-8. The Dolphins would trail 15-0 for most of the first 2 quarters, but they would score 19 unanswered points from the end of the second quarter through most of the third to take a 19-15 lead. However, the Buccaneers would take the lead for good when they scored a touchdown early in the fourth quarter to go up 22-19, which would be the final score, thus giving the Buccaneers their first win of the season. The Dolphins were also seeking their first win in Tampa since 1988.
With the bitter loss, the Dolphins fell to 4-5.
Week 11: vs. San Diego Chargers
With the win, the Dolphins improved to 5-5.
Week 12: vs. Carolina Panthers
Miami would build a 16-3 lead at one point. But the Panthers would rally behind Cam Newton to score a touchdown with less than a minute left. For the first time in franchise history, the Dolphins were defeated by the Panthers, as they had come into this game 4-0 all time against them.
With the loss, the Dolphins fell to 5-6.
Week 13: at New York Jets
With the commanding win, the Dolphins evened their record at 6-6.
Week 14: at Pittsburgh Steelers
In a game filled with snow similar to the Snowplow Game, the Dolphins would upset the Steelers 34-28 to keep their playoff hopes alive. The game is notable for the final play, in which the Steelers lateralled the ball 7 times, with the final lateral pass being caught by Antonio Brown in stride. Brown then sprinted down the sidelines, avoided several tackles, and sprinted into the endzone for an apparent game-winning touchdown. However, most noticeable on replay, Brown barely stepped out of bounds, with the left half of his foot barely touching the sideline. With the win, the Dolphins improved to 7-6. It was also the Dolphins' first win in Pittsburgh since 1990.
Week 15: vs. New England Patriots
With the win, the Dolphins improved to 8–6 and climbed to the second Wild Card seat; however, with the Ravens' victory over the Lions the following night, the team went back to the seventh spot in the playoff hunt.
Week 16: at Buffalo Bills
With the shutout loss, the Dolphins fell to 8-7 and put their playoff hopes on the line. This was the first time the Dolphins had been shoutout since week 17 of last year against the Patriots.
Week 17: vs. New York Jets
With the loss, coupled with a win by the Steelers and Chargers, the Dolphins ended their season 8-8.

Chester City Club is at 1 Northgate Street, Chester, Cheshire, England. It is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II listed building.
History
The newsroom was built in 1807, to a design by Thomas Harrison. It opened the following year as the Commercial Coffee Room. It was later renamed as the Commercial Newsroom. In 1815 the contents of the city library were moved into the building, but later transferred into the Mechanics' Institute, before the creation of the city's free public library in 1877. The newsroom was managed by a committee, and at the time its "automatic" members included the mayor, the local members of parliament, and leading military officers. Since the middle of the 19th century it has been known as the Chester City Club.
Architecture
The building is constructed in yellow ashlar stone on the front, and brown brick on the sides and rear. Its architectural style is Greek Revival. The building is expressed as two storeys at the front, and three at the back. On the front facing Northgate Street the lower storey consists of a rusticated three-bay arcade, set behind which are modern shop fronts. In the upper storey are four Ionic pilasters dividing it into three bays, each of which contains a 24-pane sash window. At the top of the building is a pediment above an architrave and a frieze. On each side of the building, to the north and the south, are passages leading St Peter's Churchyard. The rear of the building contains the original entrance to the club.

The criteria for membership in the Commonwealth of Nations, which apply to current and prospective member states, have been altered by a series of documents issued over the past eighty-two years.
The most important of these documents were the Statute of Westminster (1931), the London Declaration (1949), the Singapore Declaration (1971), the Harare Declaration (1991), the Millbrook Commonwealth Action Programme (1995), the Edinburgh Declaration (1997), and the Kampala Communiqué (2007). New member states of the Commonwealth must abide by certain criteria that arose from these documents, the most important of which are the Harare principles and the Edinburgh criteria.
The Harare principles require all member states of the Commonwealth, old and new, to abide by certain political principles, including democracy and respect for human rights. These can be enforced upon current members, who may be suspended or expelled for failure to abide by them. To date, Fiji, Nigeria, Pakistan, and Zimbabwe have been suspended on these grounds; Zimbabwe later withdrew.
The foremost of the Edinburgh criteria requires new member states to have either constitutional or administrative ties to at least one current member state of the Commonwealth of Nations. Traditionally, new Commonwealth member states had ties to the United Kingdom. The Edinburgh criteria arose from the 1995 accession of Mozambique, at the time the only member state that was never part of the British Empire (in whole or part). The Edinburgh criteria have been reviewed, and were revised at the 2007 Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting, allowing the admission of Rwanda at the 2009 Meeting.
History
Founding documents
The formation of the Commonwealth of Nations is dated back to the Statute of Westminster, an Act of the British Parliament passed on 11 December 1931. The Statute established the independence of the Dominions, creating a group of equal members where, previously, there was one (the United Kingdom) paramount. The solitary condition of membership of the embryonic Commonwealth was that a state be a Dominion. Thus, the independence of Pakistan (1947), India (1947), and the Dominion of Ceylon (now Sri Lanka) (1948) saw the three countries join the Commonwealth as independent states that retained the King as head of state. On the other hand, Burma (1948) and Israel (1948) did not join the Commonwealth, as they chose to become republics. In 1949, the Commonwealth chose to regard Ireland as no longer being a member when Ireland repealed the External Relations Act under which the King had played a role in its diplomatic relations with other states, although the Irish government's view was that Ireland had not been a member for some years.
With India on the verge of promulgating a republican constitution, the 1949 Commonwealth Prime Ministers Conference was dominated by the impending departure of over half of the Commonwealth's population. To avoid such a fate, Canadian Prime Minister Louis St. Laurent proposed that republics be allowed to remain in the Commonwealth, provided that they recognise King George VI as 'Head of the Commonwealth'. Known as the London Declaration, this agreement thus established the only formalised rule as being that members must recognise the Head of the Commonwealth. The arrangement prompted suggestions that other countries, such as France, Israel, and Norway, join. However, until Western Samoa joined in 1970, only recently independent countries would accede.
Singapore Declaration
The first statement of the political values of the Commonwealth of Nations was issued at the 1961 conference, at which the members declared that racial equality would be one of the cornerstones of the new Commonwealth, at a time when the organisation's ranks were being swelled by new African and Caribbean members. The immediate result of this was the withdrawal of South Africa's re-application, which it was required to lodge before becoming a republic, as its government's apartheid policies clearly contradicted the principle.
Further political values and principles of the Commonwealth were affirmed in Singapore on 22 January 1971, at the first Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting (CHOGM). The fourteen points clarified the political freedom of its members, and dictated the core principles of the Commonwealth: world peace, liberty, human rights, equality, and free trade. However, neither the terms nor the spirit of the Declaration were binding, and several openly flouted it; despite little conformity, only Fiji was ever expelled for breaching these tenets (on 15 October 1987, following the second coup of that year).
Harare Declaration
The Harare Declaration, issued on 20 October 1991 in Harare, Zimbabwe, reaffirmed the principles laid out in Singapore, particularly in the light of the ongoing dismantling of apartheid in South Africa. The Declaration put emphasis on human rights and democracy by detailing these principles once more:
In 2002, Zimbabwe was suspended for breaching the Harare Declaration. Subsequently, when the Commonwealth refused to lift the suspension, Zimbabwe withdrew from the Commonwealth in 2003.
Millbrook Programme
The Millbrook Commonwealth Action Programme, issued on 12 November 1995 at the Millbrook Resort, near Queenstown, New Zealand, clarified the Commonwealth's position on the Harare Declaration. The document introduced compulsion upon its members, with strict guidelines to be followed in the event of breaching its rules. These included but were not limited to expulsion from the Commonwealth. Adjudication was left to the newly created Commonwealth Ministerial Action Group (CMAG).
At the same CHOGM, the Programme was enforced for the first time, as Nigeria was suspended. On 19 December 1995, the CMAG found that the suspension was in line with the Programme, and also declared its intent on enforcing the Programme in other cases (particularly Sierra Leone and The Gambia). On 29 May 1999, the day after the inauguration of Nigeria's first democratically elected President since the end of military rule, Olusẹgun Ọbasanjọ, the country's suspension was lifted, on the advice of the CMAG.
Edinburgh criteria
In 1995, Mozambique joined the Commonwealth, becoming the first member state to have never had a constitutional link with the United Kingdom or another Commonwealth member state. Concerns that this would allow open-ended expansion of the Commonwealth and dilute its historic ties prompted the 1995 CHOGM to launch the Inter-Governmental Group on Criteria for Commonwealth Membership, to report at the 1997 CHOGM, to be held in Edinburgh, Scotland. The group decided that, in future, new member states would be limited to those with constitutional association with an existing Commonwealth member state.
In addition to this new rule, the former rules were consolidated into a single document. They had been prepared for the High Level Appraisal Group set up at the 1989 CHOGM, but not publicly announced until 1997. These requirements, which remain the same today, are that members must:
accept and comply with the Harare principles.
be fully independent sovereign states.
recognise King Charles III as the Head of the Commonwealth.
accept the English language as the means of Commonwealth communication.
respect the wishes of the general population vis-à-vis Commonwealth membership.
Kampala review
On the advice of Secretary-General Don McKinnon, the 2005 CHOGM, held in Valletta, Malta, decided to re-examine the Edinburgh criteria. The Committee on Commonwealth Membership reported at the 2007 CHOGM, held in Kampala, Uganda. According to Don McKinnon, the members of the Commonwealth decided in principle to expand the membership of the organisation to include countries without linkages to the Commonwealth, but Eduardo del Buey stated that it would still take some time until the criteria are reformed. Outstanding applications as of the 2007 meeting included former Belgian colony Rwanda (application submitted in 2003 and approved in 2009), the former French colonies of Algeria and Madagascar, and the former British colony of Yemen and condominium of Sudan.
The revised requirements stated that:
(a) an applicant country should, as a general rule, have had a historic constitutional association with an existing Commonwealth member state, save in exceptional circumstances;
(b) in exceptional circumstances, applications should be considered on a case-by-case basis;
(c) an applicant country should accept and comply with Commonwealth fundamental values, principles, and priorities as set out in the 1971 Declaration of Commonwealth Principles and contained in other subsequent Declarations;
(d) an applicant country must demonstrate commitment to: democracy and democratic processes, including free and fair elections and representative legislatures; the rule of law and independence of the judiciary; good governance, including a well-trained public service and transparent public accounts; and protection of human rights, freedom of expression, and equality of opportunity;
(e) an applicant country should accept Commonwealth norms and conventions, such as the use of the English language as the medium of inter-Commonwealth relations, and acknowledge Queen Elizabeth II as the Head of the Commonwealth; and
(f) new member states should be encouraged to join the Commonwealth Foundation, and to promote vigorous civil society and business organisations within their countries, and to foster participatory democracy through regular civil society consultations
Rwanda became the 54th nation to join the Commonwealth at the 2009 CHOGM. It became the second country (after Mozambique) not to have any historical ties with the United Kingdom. Rwanda had been a colony of Germany in the 19th century and of Belgium for the first half of the 20th century. Later ties with France were severed during the 1994 Rwandan genocide. President Paul Kagame also accused it of supporting the killings and expelled a number of French organisations from the country. Since the end of the genocide, English has increased in use. Prime Minister of Malaysia Najib Tun Razak stated that Rwanda's application "was boosted by its commitment towards democracy as well as the values espoused by the Commonwealth". Consideration for its admission was also seen as an "exceptional circumstance" by the Commonwealth Secretariat.
Rwanda was admitted despite the Commonwealth Human Rights Initiative (CHRI) finding that "the state of governance and human rights in Rwanda does not satisfy Commonwealth standards”, and that it “does not therefore qualify for admission". CHRI also commented that: "It does not make sense to admit a state that already does not satisfy Commonwealth standards. This would tarnish the reputation of the Commonwealth and confirm the opinion of many people and civic organisations that the leaders of its governments do not really care for democracy and human rights, and that its periodic, solemn declarations are merely hot air."
Both CHRI and Human Rights Watch have found that respect for democracy and human rights in Rwanda has declined since the country joined the Commonwealth.

The O. Winston Link Museum is a museum dedicated to the photography of O. Winston Link, the twentieth century railroad photographer widely considered the master of the juxtaposition between steam railroading and rural culture. He is most noted for his 1950's photographs of steam locomotives taken at night, lit by numerous flashbulbs. He carefully planned the lighting and the staging of these photos, placing human subjects in many.
In downtown Roanoke, Virginia, the museum is in a restored Norfolk & Western Railway passenger train station. It opened in January 2004. The building is included in the Norfolk and Western Railway Company Historic District, listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1999.
It currently displays hundreds of photographic prints and has several interactive displays including audio that provide information on Link's photographic subjects. Also displayed are some of the equipment that Link employed to create his night time photographs.

Ian F Svenonius is an American musician and singer of various Washington, D.C.-based punk bands including Nation of Ulysses, the Make-Up, Weird War, XYZ, Escape-ism, and Chain and the Gang. Between his numerous projects, Svenonius has released more than 22 full-length albums and over 20 singles, EPs, and splits. A published author and online talk show host, Svenonius' projects share a tongue-in-cheek, radical left political ideology.
His first band, Nation of Ulysses, which released its first record in 1990, was highly influential in the punk scene but dissolved in 1992. After a short-lived side-project called Cupid Car Club, Svenonius formed the Make-Up in 1995, who combined garage rock, soul, and liberation theology to make a new genre they dubbed "Gospel Yeh-Yeh". The Make-Up disbanded early in 2001, and a year later, Svenonius formed the band Weird War, who were also known briefly as the Scene Creamers. Later Svenonius led the band Chain and the Gang. Currently, Svenious is the leader of Esape-ism.
Svenonius' solo work includes the 2001 album Play Power under the fictional pseudonym of David Candy, the book The Psychic Soviet, and as host of Soft Focus on VBS.tv.
Musical projects
Nation of Ulysses
Svenonius' first musical group was Nation of Ulysses. The band formed in spring 1988, initially composed of four members, Svenonius on vocals and trumpet, Steve Kroner on guitar, Steve Gamboa on bass guitar, and James Canty on drums, and known simply as "Ulysses". In late 1989, Tim Green joined the band as a second guitarist and the band was renamed to "Nation of Ulysses". The Nation of Ulysses described themselves not as a rock and roll group in the traditional sense, but "as a political party" and as "a shout of secession". Explaining their intent, Svenonius said "it's basically a new nation underground for the dispossessed youth colony. It's all about smashing the old edifice, the monolith of rock and roll".
In 1990, before the band released any official albums, Svenonius was featured as teen-oriented Sassy Magazine'''s first "Sassiest Boy in America." He was interviewed in the magazine's October issue, detailing the band's sound and political motivations. Svenonius stated that the Nation of Ulysses' intent was "to create a space of liberation where anything's possible". He criticized "traditional rock-and-roll" groups as a "corrupt medium." The contest was reportedly a "nationwide search for the most perfect boyfriend material a girl could ask for", and Svenonius was among 150 entries.
Nation of Ulysses was known for their extremely physical performances, during which Svenonius recalls many injuries, including breaking his arm, his leg, and his skull on numerous occasions. Audience members were also hurt during some performances.
The group disbanded in the fall of 1992 having failed to complete their third album (the finished tracks were later released as The Embassy Tapes in 2000). In a later interview, Svenonius explained the reason for the split: "Nation of Ulysses broke up because the epoch changed with the advent of digital music and the Nirvana explosion. We were faced with what's now known as indie rock, a sort of vacuous form. We had to determine our next move and this [the forming of The Make-Up] is it".
The Make-Up
The Make-Up formed in 1995, consisting of Svenonius, Canty, and Gamboa from Nation of Ulysses, and with the addition of Michelle Mae on bass guitar. The Make-Up were joined in late 1999 by a fifth member, Alex Minoff, who played guitar with the group until their dissolution in 2001. In the band's five years of activity, they released four studio albums, two live albums, a posthumous compilation of singles and B-sides, and a number of 12-inch singles and splits. The Make-Up combined garage rock, soul, and self-styled "liberation theology" to make a new genre they called "Gospel Yeh-Yeh". The Make-Up were highly influenced by bubblegum music, particularly the French variety called Yé-yé music.
As the Make-Up's frontman and mouthpiece, Ian Svenonius often contextualized the band's music in terms of larger socio-political themes, typically describing the band and its gospel attitude in Marxist and socialist terms, in opposition of what he saw as the capitalist, bourgeois, machismo paradigm of rock and roll. The band's aversion to American culture was expressed through their self-styled musical genre "Gospel Yeh-Yeh," a belief system through which they advocated to their audience to "get theirs" and to "off the pigs in all their forms". The Make-Up intended to create ad-lib performances to re-energize what they saw as the stale, bland and formal ritual of rock and roll. Appropriating gospel music's use of to congregate as a "fifth member," the Make-Up incorporated audience participation through call and response vocals, lyrical "discussion" techniques, and destruction of the fourth wall by physical transgression.
The Make-Up dissolved in 2000, reportedly "due to the large number of counter-gang copy groups which had appropriated their look and sound and applied it to a vacuous and counter-revolutionary forms". Between projects, Svenonius released a solo album under the pseudonym David Candy.
Weird War
After the Make-Up disbanded, Svenonius formed the group Weird War in 2001, joined by Make-Up members Michelle Mae and Alex Minoff. While the current lineup appears on the group's first release I'll Never Forget What's His Name, the group's first full-length, eponymous release featured Neil Hagerty and Jessica Espeleta on guitars, and Steve McCarty on drums.
These collaborators soon left to pursue other projects, and the band briefly changed its name to The Scene Creamers, with Svenonius on vocals, Michelle Mae on bass, Alex Minoff on guitar, and Blake Brunner on drums. In this incarnation, the band released I Suck on that Emotion, through Drag City. After being threatened with a legal suit for the name Scene Creamers by a French graffiti artist collective of the same name, the band reverted to the name Weird War. Since then, as its membership has become static, with the addition of Argentine Sebastian Thomson on drums, its intent has become more cosmic. Weird War claims that they are "the sole answer to the hype-based careerism, empty formalism and vacuity which has infected what was once a genuinely creative underground rock 'n' roll scene".
Chain and the Gang
Svenonius' musical project, Chain and The Gang, released the albums Down With Liberty... Up With Chains!, "Music's Not For Everyone", "In Cool Blood" on K Records, and "Minimum Rock 'n' Roll" on Radical Elite Records. Some of the musicians featured on these records are Calvin Johnson, Brett Lyman (Bad Thoughts/M'Ladys's Records), Fiona Campbell (Vivian Girls/Coasting), Sarah Pedal, Katie Alice Greer (Priests), Faustine Hudson (The Curious Mystery), Brian Weber (Dub Narcotic Sound System), Veronica Ortuño (Finally Punk/Carrots), Nicolaas Zwart (Desolation Wilderness), Karl Blau, Chris Sutton (Hornet Leg, The Gossip), Sixx (The Vibrarians), Arrington de Dionyso, Aaron Hartman, Benjamin Hartman (Old Time Relijun), Anna Nasty (Olivia Neutron-John), and Francy Graham.
Other projects
Throughout his career, Svenonius has disc jockeyed at clubs such as Cold Rice in Washington, D.C. In 1993 Svenonius and Nation of Ulysses/Make-Up members James Canty and Steve Gamboa were involved in the short-lived project Cupid Car Club, which released only one EP on Kill Rock Stars Records entitled Join our Club. In 2001 Svenonius collaborated with the English conceptualist/producer Mike Alway of If.. Records to create the record Play Power under the pseudonym David Candy. The album was released through Jet Set Records, Siesta Records, and If.. Records. Play Power was part of a series of "Magazine-Style Records" which included other imaginary acts such as Death by Chocolate, Maria Napoleon, and Lollipop Train.
Svenonius wrote an afterword for Glen E. Friedman's 2005 photography book Recognize (), as well as the introduction to Friedman's 2007 book Keep Your Eyes Open (). As host of the VBS.TV online show Soft Focus, Svenonius interviews guests such as Ian MacKaye, Genesis P-Orridge, Adam Horovitz, Cat Power and Will Oldham in front of a live audience at the Guggenheim Museum in New York City. Soft Focus has recently moved to London, England, where Svenonius interviews British artists such as Mark E. Smith of The Fall and Billy Childish. In 1994, Svenonius had a supporting role in the independent film Half-Cocked. In 2001, Svenonius appeared in the documentary Plaster Caster about the plaster casts of Cynthia Plaster Caster.
Sassiest Boy in America
In 1990 Sassy magazine conducted a search for the Sassiest Boy in America. Over 150 entries were received with the eventual winner being Ian Svenonius. In the story highlighting his selection Sassy founding editor Jane Pratt states "He's going to be a big deal. I'm sure he will be and we're going to be so proud that we were the first ones to discover him." Though Svenonius was too old to qualify for the title under the rules of the contest, this was not discovered until after he had already won.
The Psychic Soviet
In July 2006, Svenonius released a book of 19 essays entitled the Psychic Soviet (), published by Drag City Press. Pocket-sized and bound in bright-pink plastic with beveled edges, its form is similar to "The Little Red Book," a Bible, or a foreign-language dictionary. The book serves as an anthology of past articles and essays by Svenonius previously published in periodicals, edited for readability and flow, with a number of new essays included.
The "Instructions" that preface the book state that it "should clear up much of the confusion regarding events of the last millennium – artistic, geo-political, philosophical, et al." and encourages the reader to "refer to the book in case of ethical quandaries, arguments, and social feuds". The writing addresses topics such as the ascent of the DJ as a "star," the "cosmic depression" that followed the defeat of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics in the Cold War, and the status of rock and roll as a religion. To date, The Psychic Soviet is the most complete collection of written material by Svenonius.

Driven is a 2001 American action sports film directed by Renny Harlin and starring Sylvester Stallone, who also wrote and produced. It centers on a young racing driver's effort to win the CART FedEx Championship Series auto racing championship. Prior to production, Stallone was seen at many Formula One races, but he was unable to procure enough information about the category due to the secrecy with which teams protect their cars, so he decided to base the film on Champ Car.
Driven received generally negative reviews from critics, and was a commercial failure.
Plot
Halfway through the fictionalized 2000 Champ Car Season, rookie driver Jimmy Bly has already won five races. His brother/business manager Demille seems more concerned with working out endorsement deals and press engagements than racing, putting tremendous pressure upon Jimmy. His success has also drawn the ire of the reigning champion and series points leader Beau Brandenburg, who believes he's not doing as well as he should because of his fiancée Sophia becoming "a distraction". Brandenburg breaks up their engagement and he regains his winning streak at Chicago Motor Speedway.
As Brandenburg returns to form, Jimmy's paraplegic team owner Carl Henry is concerned that he is making more driving errors. He sees parallels to his former driver and Champ Car Champion, Joe Tanto, whom he convinces to come out of retirement to mentor Jimmy. Joe agrees and is brought in to replace Jimmy's teammate, Memo Moreno. To complicate matters, Joe's ex-wife Cathy Heguy is now married to Memo, the driver that Joe replaced. Despite all this, Joe and Memo are still friends. Demille takes a dislike to Joe's mentoring, implying that Joe should just act as a blocker.
Joe's comeback race in Canada is extremely close, with Jimmy leading and Brandenburg a close second. Jimmy can't seem to pull away from him, so Carl orders Joe to pit and holds him there until the leaders are about to come by, despite Joe's protests. At the last second, Joe leaves the pit just in time to block out Brandenburg, allowing Jimmy to win the race. At the same time, Jimmy starts to form a bond with Sophia, and they start hanging out together; their bond grows further when they travel to Japan, where the next race is held. Joe urges Brandenburg to reconcile with Sophia, while Jimmy's growing bond with Sophia causes him to further lose his form on the track during the next race and results in him crashing out.
At a party in Chicago, where the prototypes of next year's cars are being introduced, Brandenburg and Sophia reconcile, much to Jimmy's disappointment. Sophia apologizes to Jimmy, but he angrily lashes out at her and Brandenburg, then takes one of the new cars and races it out of the convention center. Joe hops into another of the new cars and chases Jimmy down the streets of Chicago, eventually calming him down and bringing him back to his senses after they stop driving. In the coming race in Germany, Carl decides that bringing back Joe isn't getting the results he wants, so he reinstates Memo while making Joe mentor Jimmy from the pit lane.
The next race begins in the middle of the rain, with Jimmy and Brandenburg once again fighting it out for first. Jimmy needs one more win to take the championship, and Memo is instructed to block for him and keep out of his way. However, Cathy convinces Memo to go for the win, and as a result, he collides with Jimmy in a horrific crash that sends him flying into a lake on the far end of the course. Jimmy and Brandenburg dive into the lake and rescue Memo just as a burning tree collapses onto the burning car and ignites the leaking fuel, causing an explosion. This event causes Brandenburg to warm up to Jimmy, telling him he's a good man.
Carl, angered by Jimmy's decision to rescue Moreno instead of fighting on for the championship, decides to replace him with Brandenburg for the coming season and negotiates a deal with Demille, who will now represent Brandenburg. Demille tries to get Brandenburg to sign the new contract, but Brandenburg refuses the deal; Sophia punches Demille in the face for the way he treated her previously. Initially, Jimmy is barred from competing due to a foot injury he sustained during the rescue, but Carl finally decides to clear him for the race after he passes Carl's strength test, and Jimmy thanks both Sophia and Brandenburg for refusing his brother's deal.
At the final race of the year in Detroit, Jimmy and Brandenburg are contenders for the championship. With Memo now hospitalized, Joe is racing again as Jimmy's teammate. In the final laps, Joe takes the lead but damages his front suspension by avoiding a crash. He can no longer contend for the win and the two leaders pass him on the final lap. Jimmy starts to have a mental lapse, but upon hearing Joe's words of wisdom, he pulls ahead of Brandenburg by just a few inches, while Joe's spinning car crosses in third. In front of a large crowd of spectators, including Sophia and Demille, who finally shows he is proud of his brother, Jimmy is named the new champion and he celebrates his victory with Joe and Brandenburg.
Cast
Montoya, Gugelmin, and Blundell lent their car and helmet likeness to Brandenburg, Tanto and Bly respectively, Blundell's helmet being suitably changed from an "MB" logo to "JB". Team Penske with 2 drivers Hélio Castroneves, Gil De Ferran and team owner Roger Penske was originally to be featured on the film but they removed them for unknown reasons.
Production
Development and writing
Stallone became interested in the world of racing while making Judge Dredd in Europe, and decided to make a film with that backdrop. He had originally intended to make a film based on Formula One, attending the 1997 Italian Grand Prix and stating his goal in a press conference. However, the plan was subsequently dropped.
Stallone said he wrote about twenty-five drafts.
And of those, about 20 were about this one man's journey, myself, through this film, and all his trials and tribulations. He'd fallen from a great height career-wise. He was a drunkard with all these problems and accidents because he and his wife Cathy, who's played by Gina Gershon, had this very tumultuous relationship. (Laughs) I'm giving you a little biographical hint here. And he just started to come apart. So he was brought back as kind of like how people should never be. It's like taking kids who are truants and then taking them to prison to see where they'll end up and scaring them straight. So I was brought back to basically prove to young Jimmy Bly how he should never be, as a bad example. And then the more we worked on it, it became the dark side, a little seedy, and I didn't know where the upside of it was ever going to be. So we began to reduce his role and make it more of an ensemble, so he's just there as a guy who did his job, wasn't very spectacular, would race like hell, sometimes he'd win, sometimes lose, but he had a certain work ethic code, that old school that could be applied to Jimmy. So that all made it more ensemble, and then in the editing we reduced it even more. I originally had a relationship going with the reporter. But that began to de-emphasise the other people, so we put that on the back burner... So we did shoot it but if we said, "Nah, it's not really flying."
Stallone said the film was autobiographical in a lot of ways.
Racing's very much like the world of acting. You have your front runners and you have guys that are there for the long race, and you have other guys that block for other people, that are called supporting and character actors. It's all the same kind of situation. And you realize that you can't always be No. 1. You just can't be the guy in front all the time. So what you can do is lend support to, and help and nourish and encourage someone else. So it's like your experiences live on in someone else. If you can find some young actor and you can say, 'Listen, don't do this and don't do that and avoid this and that,' and share your experiences, and he does succeed, you can say, 'You know what, I kind of contributed to that.' As an actor did you have to learn you can't always be No.1 the hard way? (Laughs) Unfortuantely I did
Stallone says it took four years to get the finance to make the film.
Stallone and Harlin had previously worked together on Cliffhanger. Harlin had been trying to develop a film on the life of Ayrton Senna and when that fell through signed on to make Driven.
Filming
The film was shot primarily in Toronto, Canada, from 6 July 2000 until 12 October 2000, as well as at a variety of worldwide races which were sanctioned by CART. The German race was filmed at the Continental test track in Hanover rather than the Lausitzring oval.
When Sylvester Stallone's character arrives at a race early in the film, there's a long shot of him walking in, saying hello to various people. One very brief uncredited cameo contains Dustin Hoffman, in racing gear.
Post-production
Matt Hullum of Rooster Teeth Productions fame was the visual effects producer.
The film premiere took place at Grauman's Chinese Theatre, with several CART competitors driving and demonstrating pit stops in modified Champ Cars down Hollywood Blvd.
According to director Harlin's commentary, his first cut was four hours long. Only 51 minutes of deleted footage was included as special feature on DVD.
Reception
Box office
Driven was a commercial failure, and grossed only $32 million against a $72 million budget. This poor performance ended a modestly successful recovery (with 1999 film Deep Blue Sea and 1996 film The Long Kiss Goodnight) from director Harlin's critical and financial failure Cutthroat Island. However, it was Stallone's first #1 opening film since Cop Land.
Critical response
On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a 14% score based on 111 reviews, with an average rating of 3.60/10. The site's consensus states: "Underdeveloped characters, silly plot dynamics, and obvious CG effects." On Metacritic it has a score of 29 out of 100 rating based on 26 critics, indicating "generally unfavorable reviews". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of "B−" on an A+ to F scale.
Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times said Harlin "has made better pictures [...] but delivers the goods here". Ebert is critical of the editing, the lack of character conflict and the all too happy ending. He gave it 2.5 out of 4.
Entertainment Weekly's Owen Gleiberman called it "Mostly preposterous, and it has no dramatic center, but the racing scenes hold you in their death-trip grip" and gave it a grade C+.
Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times wrote: "Harlin's skill compensates for a lot of narrative preposterousnesses, even it is overmatched this time around."
When Jay Leno appeared as a guest critic on the television show Ebert & Roeper, both Leno and Richard Roeper described Driven as the worst car film ever made, and a terrible depiction of auto racing.
Stallone has said he regrets making the film.
Accolades
The film earned seven nominations at the 22nd Golden Raspberry Awards, including Worst Picture, The Worst Director, The Worst Screenplay, Worst Screen Couple (Reynolds and Stallone) and twice for Worst Supporting Actor (Reynolds and Stallone), with Estella Warren winning Worst Supporting Actress (also for Planet of the Apes).
Other media
Video game
A video game Driven based on the film was released in 2001 for the Game Boy Advance, Nintendo GameCube, and PlayStation 2.

Mitigating evidence is evidence that is provided (usually by the defendant in a criminal trial) in order to try to establish the presence of mitigating circumstances. The presence of mitigating circumstances can reduce the punishment imposed for the offense. The case of the Oregon v. Guzek dealt with the issue of whether alibi evidence not introduced at trial could be introduced in the sentencing phase of a death penalty trial as mitigating evidence.

Cory Ephram Joseph (born August 20, 1991) is a Canadian professional basketball player for the Detroit Pistons of the National Basketball Association (NBA). He plays the point guard position and is also the captain of the Canadian national team.
Early life and family
Joseph was born in Toronto, Ontario, the youngest of four children of Connie and David Joseph, who was born in Trinidad and Tobago. He grew up in nearby Pickering in a basketball family; his parents met as student athletes at Mount Royal College while playing for their respective men's and women's basketball teams. His father won a CCAA national championship, playing for the Southern Alberta Institute of Technology, and later coached at the high school, college, and professional levels. His mother coached and refereed at various levels. Joseph has two older sisters, Chantal and Danielle, and an older brother, Devoe, who played in college for Minnesota and Oregon, and currently plays professionally in Europe.
Two of Joseph's second cousins also played college basketball: Kris played for Syracuse and was selected in the second round of the 2012 NBA draft by the Boston Celtics, while Maurice played for Michigan State and Vermont, and formerly served as the head coach of George Washington University. Another cousin of Joseph's, Ashton Khan, is also a professional basketball player who plays in the British Basketball League.
As a youth, Joseph and fellow future NBA player Kelly Olynyk were both on a Scarborough Blues club team that rarely lost in the late 1990s and early 2000s. One defeat came against rival Toronto 5–0, led by Stephen Curry.
High school career
Joseph attended Pickering High School in Ajax, Ontario. He and his brother Devoe led the school's AAAA basketball team to back-to-back Ontario provincial championships in 2007 and 2008, defeating Eastern Commerce Collegiate Institute both years in the championship game. Their father served as the team's assistant coach during that time. In 2008, he and Devoe were selected to play in the annual All-Canada Classic, which showcases the top high school players in Canada.
Later that year, at age 16, Joseph transferred to Findlay Prep in Henderson, Nevada with Tristan Thompson, his close friend and AAU teammate. He increased his recruiting demand by leading Findlay Prep to the ESPN RISE National High School Invitational championship game in 2009, alongside Thompson and Avery Bradley, in which #2 ranked Findlay Prep defeated #1 ranked Oak Hill Academy, 74–66. He was named to the ESPN RISE All-Tournament Team. In August 2009, Joseph was selected to play in the fourth annual Boost Mobile Elite 24 basketball game at Rucker Park in Harlem, New York City. The game showcases the top 24 high school basketball players in the U.S. regardless of recruiting class.
In his senior year, Joseph and Thompson led #2 ranked Findlay Prep to a second consecutive ESPN RISE National High School Invitational championship in 2010, when they defeated #1 ranked Montverde Academy, 59–46. He was named to the ESPN RISE All-Tournament Team for the second consecutive year and was also named tournament MVP. He was ranked as the #7 prospect nationally by Rivals.com and #11 in the ESPNU 100 following the season, in which he averaged 18.8 points, 4.9 assists, 6.7 rebounds, and 2.5 steals per game. Joseph then played in the 2010 McDonald's All-American Game. He also won the McDonald's Three Point Competition and was named a Jordan Brand Classic All-American. On April 11, 2010, he played for the World Select Team at the Nike Hoop Summit, against the United States Junior Select Team. The game was held at the Rose Garden in Portland, Oregon. The World Select Team lost, 101–97. Twelve days later, Joseph committed to the University of Texas, joining Thompson.
College career
Joseph started all 36 games in his freshman season, leading the team in scoring four times and in rebounding twice. Joseph played one of his best games on December 18, 2010, recording a season-high 21 points and a game-winning jumper against North Carolina. Texas entered 2011 NCAA March Madness as the fourth seed in the West Regional Division. Texas lost to fifth-seeded Arizona in the third round with a standout performance and game-winning shot from Derrick Williams. Following the end of the season, Joseph declared for the NBA draft and was named to the Big 12 All-Freshman team.
Professional career
San Antonio Spurs (2011–2015)
On June 23, 2011, Joseph was drafted 29th overall in the 2011 NBA draft by the San Antonio Spurs. Fellow Canadian and Longhorn, Thompson, was drafted fourth overall by the Cleveland Cavaliers, becoming the highest Canadian born draftee in NBA history at that point. (Anthony Bennett and Andrew Wiggins both went first overall in the 2013 and 2014 drafts respectively.) It was also the second time in NBA history that two Canadians were selected in the first round of the same draft, the first being in 1983 when Leo Rautins and Stewart Granger were selected 17th and 25th, respectively. The 2011 draft was also the first time three Texas Longhorn basketball players went in the first round after Joseph's former collegiate teammate Jordan Hamilton went 26th overall to Dallas Mavericks.
During the 2011–12 season, the Spurs assigned Joseph to the Austin Toros of the NBA D-League three times. He was also assigned to the Toros during the 2012–13 season. On February 4, 2013, Joseph was named to the Prospects All-Star roster for the 2013 NBA D-League All-Star Game. However, due to injury, he was replaced by Justin Dentmon.
In late February 2013, Tony Parker sustained an injury, and Joseph became the Spurs' starting point guard. In his first five starts, Joseph averaged 8.8 points and 2.6 assists while shooting 58.6 percent. Joseph helped the Spurs reach the 2013 NBA Finals against the Miami Heat, but San Antonio lost the series in seven games.
On June 15, 2014, Joseph won his first NBA championship after the Spurs defeated the Miami Heat 4 games to 1 in the 2014 NBA Finals.
On June 30, 2015, the Spurs extended a qualifying offer to Joseph in order to make him a restricted free agent but, on July 5, the team withdrew their qualifying offer.
Toronto Raptors (2015–2017)
On July 9, 2015, Joseph signed a four-year, $30 million contract with his hometown team, the Toronto Raptors. He made his debut for the Raptors in their season opener on October 28, 2015, recording three points and two rebounds in a 106–99 win over the Indiana Pacers. Over his first few games with the Raptors, Joseph began to flourish in his role as backup point guard, averaging a career-high 23 minutes per game. On November 6, 2015, he scored a season-high 19 points against the Orlando Magic, one off his career high of 20. On November 28, 2015, he scored 12 points and made a three-pointer at the buzzer following a well-worked inbounds play, lifting the Raptors an 84–82 win over the Washington Wizards. The Raptors finished the regular season as the second seed in the East with a 56–26 record. On April 16, 2016, Joseph scored a playoff career-high 18 points in a Game 1 loss to the seventh-seeded Indiana Pacers in the first round.
On January 17, 2017, Joseph scored a career-high 33 points in a 119–109 win over the Brooklyn Nets. On March 27, 2017, he had his first career double-double with 15 points and a career-high 13 assists in a 131–112 win over the Orlando Magic. On May 7, 2017, in Game 4 of the Raptors' second-round playoff series with the Cleveland Cavaliers, Joseph had 20 points and 12 assists while starting in place of the injured Kyle Lowry; the Raptors were defeated 109–102 to bow out of the playoffs in a clean sweep, losing 4–0 to the Cavaliers.
Indiana Pacers (2017–2019)
On July 14, 2017, Joseph was traded to the Indiana Pacers in exchange for the draft rights of Emir Preldžić. In his debut for the Pacers in their season opener on October 18, 2017, Joseph scored 11 points in a 140–131 win over the Brooklyn Nets.
On February 9, 2019, Joseph had 10 points, 10 assists and nine rebounds in a 105–90 win over the Cleveland Cavaliers.
Sacramento Kings (2019–2021)
On July 6, 2019, Joseph signed with the Sacramento Kings.
On January 30, 2020, Joseph scored a season-high 16 points, while also getting two rebounds, seven assists, one steal and one block in an 124–103 victory against the Los Angeles Clippers.
Detroit Pistons (2021–present)
On March 26, 2021, Joseph was traded to the Detroit Pistons, along with two future second-round draft picks, in exchange for Delon Wright.
On July 31, 2021, Joseph was waived by the Pistons. On August 11, 2021, Joseph was re-signed by the Pistons.

The Chollima-321 (Korean: 천리마 -321) is a North Korean trolleybus with battery power built by the Pyongyang Trolley Bus Factory. The name 'Chollima' refers to a myth about a winged horse that has since been adopted as the name of North Korea's Stakhanovite movement. The production of the Chollima-321 production replaced the Chollima-091 articulated trolleybus, due to the need to replace older Chollima-961, -951, Ikarus and Karosa bus based trolleybuses. The trolleybus features on a 50 won stamp.
In Japanese sources, it is called the Mallima-312.
Design
The new trolleybus was first tested at night, with Kim Jong-un onboard, which had become a tradition for the testing of new modes of public transport. Before that, Kim Jong-un had visited the trolleybus factory, confirming the specifications of the trolleybus, such as the door width. The vehicle that he had ridden on would be numbered 483, in honour of the route he had taken, and the date on which he had tested it, August 3. The production vehicles differ that there is an additional blinker above the headlights, different lights on the rear and a ladder to the roof at the rear. The first seat is reserved for 'heroes'.
The trolleybus has a digital dashboard that monitors the overhead wire voltage, speed and battery voltage. It features a TV manufactured by Potonggang Electronics Factory. Like the Chollima-316, it has LED indicators for the route on front and rear, but the Chollima-321 also has one inside. The vehicle has no air conditioner. A new type of motor, which is more efficient than previous models was introduced on this trolleybus.
This model demonstrated that the trolleybus factory had mastered the use of plastic moulding, which was reported as achieved through CNC machines and plasma cutters. It is claimed that almost all parts are built at the factory, which after its refurbishment completed in early 2018, featured a full assembly line for trolleybuses, from framing to painting of the vehicle, with the plating of trolleybuses being automated. A new production process of curved glass was reportedly created for the use in electric public transport. Other production processes that were upgraded for its production included induction furnaces and heating furnaces, used for forging of parts.
Up until January 2020, it was reported 'more than 100' trolleybuses have been manufactured in recent years, and that despite shortages in 2019, the production was pushed ahead.
The design of the Chollima-321 has been displayed at the national industrial design exhibition in celebration of the 75th year anniversary of the founding of the Workers' Party of Korea. Its design has inspired other factories, such as the Chongjin Bus Factory, which serially produced 20 new trolleybuses in a design clearly inspired by the Chollima-321. Other similar models have been built in Hamhung and Pyongsong. The design and colour scheme of the trolleybus is similar to the 'Thongil' tram that was manufactured at the same time.
Service
There are currently 42 known Chollima-321 trolleybuses known to be in operation. Other vehicles, such as the trolleybuses in Chongjin are a completely different model, named 'Jipsan'.

The Basic Peoples Congress, or Fundamental Popular Council (), was the smallest unit of government in Muammar Gaddafi's Libya. It governed the equivalent of a municipality, and that geographic district was also called a Basic Peoples Congress.
The congress consisted of every man and woman who had attained the age of majority. The actual congress met at three scheduled meetings per year or as called upon by necessity. The first meeting was usually devoted to a detailed agenda for the next two meetings. At the second meeting the Basic People's Congress discussed issues relating to the local business, while at the third meeting seats on committees were filled, representatives elected and policy at the national and international level were discussed. Day-to-day management and oversight was provided by the people's committee appointed by the congress. The next political level up was the district congresses and then above that was the General People's Congress at the top.

The National Taiwan Library () is a library in Zhonghe District, New Taipei, Taiwan. It is the oldest public library in Taiwan. Founded in 1914, the library is home to a large collection of documents concerning the history, culture, politics and geography of Taiwan.
History
The library was founded in 1914 during the Japanese colonial period as the on the order of governor Sakuma Samata. The library's first permanent home on Bo'ai Road (博愛路) in Taipei was destroyed in a United States bombing raid during World War II.
After the Nationalists took over control of the island following Japan's defeat in World War II, the library was renamed the Taiwan Provincial Library () and moved to temporary accommodation. The implication of this name, as well as all the subsequent names, is that Taiwan is only one part of the Republic of China.
In 1947, it was again renamed, this time to Taiwan Provincial Taipei Library () and it was under this name that the library was relocated to Xinsheng South Road (新生南路) in 1963.
The current name of the library was chosen in 1973, with the full official title being National Central Library, Taiwan Branch (). After outgrowing the premises in Taipei city, the library was relocated to the 8-23 Memorial Park in Zhonghe, Taipei County (now New Taipei City) in 2004.
In 2007, Huang Wen-ling was appointed as the twentieth director of the National Taiwan Library, and the first woman to hold the post.
Collection
The library is home to a large collection of documents related to Taiwan, some dating back to the Qing Dynasty era in Taiwan (i.e. pre-1895). There are 210,000 documents from the Japanese era (1895–1945) and the collection has been continuously added to since then. The library's aim is to provide a dedicated research centre for people interested in Taiwan Studies, offering traditional written material sources as well as information resources for researchers to locate the documents or information needed.
Services for the visually impaired are also a key focus for the institution, with a collection of 12,000 Braille books together with information technology resources for readers.
Conservation
A pioneer of book conservation techniques in Taiwan, the library is now home to a dedicated "Book Hospital" which serves not only as a centre for restoration of old books, but also a location for staff from other institutions to learn the craft.

Baker v. Wade 563 F.Supp 1121 (N.D. Tex. 1982), rev'd 769 F.2nd 289 (5th Cir. 1985) (en banc) cert denied 478 US 1022 (1986) is a federal lawsuit challenging the legality of the sodomy law of the state of Texas. Plaintiff Donald Baker contended that the law violated his rights to privacy and equal protection. After a victory at trial, an appellate court reversed the lower court's decision and in the wake of its decision in Bowers v. Hardwick the Supreme Court of the United States refused to review it.
Background
In 1974, Texas adopted a revised Penal Code which included section 21.06: "A person commits an offense if he engages in deviate sexual intercourse with another individual of the same sex." The law carried a maximum penalty of $200 but the existence of the law served to stigmatize LGBT residents of Texas as criminals. In 1976 in Doe v. Commonwealth's Attorney of Richmond (425 US 901) the United States Supreme Court upheld the sodomy law of the Commonwealth of Virginia as constitutional. A number of gay rights organizations in Texas sought to repeal the state's sodomy law legislatively but were unsuccessful. The Texas Human Rights Foundation (THRF), composed largely of attorneys from across the state, believed that the Doe case failed because the plaintiff was anonymous, and so conducted a search to find someone to be the named (and visible) plaintiff in a test case to challenge the law on Constitutional grounds before the federal court in Dallas, Texas. Donald F. Baker, president of the Dallas Gay Alliance and a Dallas teacher who had lost his job with the Dallas Independent School District after coming out in a television interview, agreed to be the sole plaintiff, and the suit was filed on November 19, 1979, in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas. The suit named Dallas County District Attorney Henry Wade and Dallas city attorney Lee Holt as defendants and, because THRF wanted any affirmative ruling to apply statewide, included each of the 1,085 city, county and district attorneys in the state as part of the defendant class. The Texas Attorney General's office intervened on behalf of the state, but no one else in the defendant class intervened.
The case went to trial before US District Judge Jerry Buchmeyer in June 1981 and lasted two days. On August 17, 1982, Buchmeyer ruled in favor of Baker on Constitutional grounds, finding that the law violated Baker's right to personal privacy and equal protection under the laws.
Appeals
Wade decided not to appeal but Attorney General Mark White filed an appeal on November 1, 1982. Following an election later that month, the new Attorney General, Jim Mattox, withdrew the appeal. The Texas Constitution invests the power to represent the state in civil litigation solely with the Attorney General, so withdrawing the appeal ordinarily would have ended the case. However, district attorney Danny Hill, recently elected to represent Potter County, along with a group of physicians called "Dallas Doctors Against AIDS", petitioned the court to force the state to appeal. Judge Buchmeyer denied the petition, as did a panel of the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, but the full Fifth Circuit voted to hear Hill's appeal. On August 26, 1985, the Fifth Circuit voted 9−7 to reverse the district court and uphold the sodomy statute. On October 23 the Court denied Baker's request for a re-hearing.
On January 18, 1986, Laurence Tribe filed a writ of certiorari on Baker's behalf with the United States Supreme Court. The attorneys general of 26 states, including 10 states with sodomy laws, urged the Court to take the case, arguing that the Court should reject the intervention of the Fifth Circuit because the decision of a state attorney general to withdraw an appeal should have ended its consideration. By the time the writ was filed, the Supreme Court had accepted Bowers v. Hardwick, a challenge to Georgia sodomy law, which criminalized all sodomy regardless of the gender or marital status of the individuals involved in the conduct. The Court upheld Georgia's sodomy law on June 30, 1986, ruling that there was no privacy right to engage in sodomy. The Supreme Court denied certiorari on July 7.
The Texas sodomy law persisted until 2003, when the Supreme Court struck it and every remaining state anti-sodomy law down in Lawrence v. Texas.

Tschudi's tapaculo (Scytalopus acutirostris) is a species of bird in the family Rhinocryptidae. It is endemic to Peru.
Taxonomy and systematics
Tschudi's tapaculo was previously considered a subspecies of Magellanic tapaculo (Scytalopus magellanicus) but was elevated to species status based on differences in their vocalizations.
Description
Tschudi's tapaculo is long. Males weigh and females . The adult male is dark gray above and lighter gray below; the flanks have a very light brownish wash. The female is paler overall, its rump has a brown wash, and its flanks and crissum (the area around the cloaca) are tawny with black bars. The juvenile has bars and spots.
Distribution and habitat
Tschudi's tapaculo is found only the Andes of Peru, from Amazonas south to Junín in a fairly narrow elevational range of . There it inhabits the undergrowth of humid cloud forest. Unlike several other tapaculos, it is rarely found in bamboo.
Behavior
Feeding
The diet of Tschudi's tapaculo appears to be mostly insects but also includes seeds. No information is available about its foraging technique.
Breeding
No information is available other than that a juvenile was collected in August.
Vocalization
The song of Tschudi's tapaculo is somewhat variable but is often short notes or a series of notes such as and . The call is repeated single notes .
Status
The IUCN has assessed Tschudi's tapaculo as being of The Least Concern. Though it has a small range and its population has not been quantified, they are both believed large enough to support that rating.

Case Closed: The Bride of Halloween, known as in Japan, is a 2022 Japanese animated mystery film directed by Susumu Mitsunaka. It is the twenty-fifth installment of the Case Closed film series based on the manga series of the same name by Gosho Aoyama, following the 2021 film. The film was released in Japan on April 15, 2022.
Plot
Former MPD superintendent Tsutomu Muranaka, set to marry his fiancée Christine Richard, receives a death threat. With police protection ensured, the police attempt to practice fighting against any threats that would happen during the wedding. Meanwhile, while chasing a serial bomber that has escaped custody, Rei Furuya is knocked unconscious and a bomb is attached to his neck. The next day, while visiting the MPD headquarters, Kogoro, Ran, Conan, and the Detective Boys come across a man holding a tablet that explodes, with Kogoro being injured while trying to protect Haibara. Conan later meets with Rei, and learns that the explosion is possibly related to an attempted bombing incident that Rei and his teammates - Morofushi, Matsuda, and Date - had prevented years ago.
Afterwards, Ran, Conan, and the Detective Boys are invited to Shibuya for location scouting for the wedding, set to take place during the Halloween festival. Christine receives a message that tells her to retrieve something, but she and Muranaka are set to have a meeting soon, so she lets the Detective Boys take the gift for her. However, when they reach the area, they find the same bomb that Rei had defused 3 years earlier and narrowly escape just as it explodes. Meanwhile, Detective Chiba is kidnapped by an unknown perpetrator, who demands to meet Detective Matsuda, not knowing that Matsuda has died 3 years ago. Detective Takagi disguises himself as Matsuda and meets with the perpetrator, who reveals herself as Elenica Lavrentyeva, the leader of Nado Unichtozit, a civilian group focusing on capturing the bomber Plamya, responsible for the bomb on Rei's neck. Elenica reveals that the hostage found during the bombing incident years ago was her brother, who had escaped with the help of Matsuda and stole a tablet from Plamya, only to be killed in front of the MPD headquarters.
The police infiltrate the area and the Nado Unichtozit members escape. Later, Christine, who considers cancelling the wedding, receives a message that forces her to hold it instead. Christine and Muranaka have the ceremony in private. With Ran's help, Conan notices a pattern of the enclosed Shibuya roads for the festival that matches the paper Elenica's brother was holding during the time of his death, and thus deduces that Muranaka might be Plamya. Conan works with Nado Unichtozit to infiltrate the wedding, only for Christine to be revealed as Plamya instead - she had led the Detective Boys to the bomb-filled building, brought the Nado Unichtozit members to Japan, and rigged the entire Shibuya festival area with the two liquids used in the bombs which, upon interaction, would create a huge explosion. Christine attempts to escape on a helicopter, but Rei, who has managed to defuse the bomb on his neck, intercepts her and blows up the helicopter, fighting her as it crashes onto the ground below.
Muranaka knocks Christine unconscious, while Conan convinces Elenica to not murder Christine. Conan, the Detective Boys, and all the members of Nado Unichtozit work together to use a huge inflatable ball to block both liquids from interacting, thus preventing the explosion that would destroy Shibuya. Christine is arrested, the liquids are cleaned from the streets, and Muranaka promises Elenica that Christine will get the justice she deserves.

Carolyn Comitta is an American politician, educator and financial officer. She is a member of the Democratic Party, currently serving in the Pennsylvania State Senate representing the 19th district. Previously, Comitta was the first woman to serve as Mayor of West Chester, the seat of Chester County, Pennsylvania, and served two terms in the Pennsylvania House of Representatives representing the 156th district.
Early life and education
Comitta was born in Buffalo, New York, and her family moved to West Goshen when she was 2 years old, where she has lived ever since. Comitta received her BS in Education from West Chester University (then West Chester State College) in 1974, and her M.Ed. from Widener University in 1989.
Professional career
From the mid-1970s to the mid-1980s, Comitta worked in the Octorara Area School District as a special and gifted education curriculum specialist and teacher. Since 1988, she has been a member of the Board of Directors of World Information Transfer, Inc., a non-profit, non-governmental educational organization focused on health- and environment-related issues.
She is the Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of her husband's firm, Thomas Comitta Associates, Town Planners and Landscape Architects.
Political career
West Chester Borough Council
Comitta was first elected to the West Chester Borough Council in 2005, taking-over the Fifth Ward seat vacated by incumbent Democratic Councilwoman Barbara McIlvaine Smith. While on Council, she served as chair of the Borough Council's Public Safety Committee, and also chaired the Planning Zoning, Business & Industrial Development Committee. She also served as a member of the Parks, Recreation and Environmental Protection Committee, as well as the Finance Committee.
Mayor of West Chester
She sought the office of Borough Mayor in 2009, and defeated Councilman Bill Scott in the Democratic primary. She was elected unopposed in the fall general election, and took office the following January. In succeeding the term-limited incumbent Mayor, Republican Dick Yoder, Comitta became West Chester's first ever female Mayor, and its first Democratic Mayor since 1992.
Pennsylvania House of Representatives
On January 7, 2016, Comitta announced her intent to run for the Pennsylvania House of Representatives in the 156th District, challenging incumbent Dan Truitt. After a lengthy recount, she was declared the winner over Truitt by 25 votes on December 16, 2016.
On November 6, 2018, Comitta won re-election against Republican challenger Nicholas Deminski by a margin of 13 points or 4,108 votes.
In 2020, Comitta sought re-election to her House seat and was unopposed in the Democratic primary. She ended her House campaign in June 2020 to focus on her Senate campaign and was replaced on the ballot by West Chester mayor Dianne Herrin.
Pennsylvania State Senate
In February 2020, State Senator Andy Dinniman announced his retirement at the end of his term. Dinniman's retirement as considered surprising as he had been preparing for a re-election campaign for a fourth term and petitioning had already begun. The day after Dinniman's announcement, Comitta announced her campaign for the Pennsylvania State Senate in the 19th District. In a three-way Democratic primary against Dinniman's longtime aide Don Vymazal and local school board member Kyle Boyer, Dinniman endorsed Vymazal, while Comitta was endorsed by Governor Tom Wolf and several labor unions. After Pennsylvania delayed their primary to June 2 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Comitta won the primary with nearly 51% of the vote.
In the general election, Comitta defeated Republican Kevin Runey with 57.43% of the vote.

The film was among the last released for Jerry Lewis, Dean Stockwell and Mort Sahl, before their passings in 2017 and 2021 respectively, although Lewis and Stockwell filmed scenes for other films later that were released before Max Rose, including The Trust, Persecuted, and Entertainment.
The film was produced by Lightstream Entertainment and Rush River Entertainment. An initial cut of the film was shown at the 2013 Cannes Film Festival. It grossed $4,000 in its opening weekend, and $66,680 worldwide, and has an approval rating of 37% based on 43 reviews Rotten Tomatoes.
Plot
Max Rose is an aging jazz pianist who learns that his wife of 65 years may have been unfaithful to him. Though his career was not everything he had hoped it would be, Max Rose always felt like a success because his beautiful, elegant wife, Eva, was by his side. While going through her things, however, Max discovers an object bearing an intimate inscription from another man, a shocking revelation that leads him to believe his entire marriage, indeed, his entire life, was built on a lie. Coping with anger, withdrawal and his own fragile health, Rose embarks on an exploration of his past, all the while searching for Eva's mystery suitor, hoping to find the answers he needs to be at peace.

Mouse avatars, or avatar mice, refers to an experimental method employed to identify the best chemotherapeutic choice for a particular cancer patient.
Origin
The method was originally employed to treat cancer patients by Dr. Manuel Hidalgo (Spanish National Cancer Research Center in Madrid). The name mouse avatar or avatar mice was originally coined by the Spanish National Cancer Research Center and was subsequently popularized by the journals Nature and Science, the Mayo Clinic and The New York Times among others.
Method
Generally, Mouse avatars involve three steps, as follows:
Step one
The tumor is obtained by surgical resection. This may cure the patient. The tumor however may regrow, at the same or at a distant location (metastasis), a process that usually entails several months. If this happens, the avatar mice may guide the oncologist to choose the most efficient chemotherapeutic treatment.
Step two
Fresh pieces of the tumor are implanted into mice (these are the so-called “first-generation” avatar mice). The implants can be at the same location where the tumor was formed in the patient, in which case are known as orthotopic xenografts or, most commonly, at a different location, generally subcutaneous, in which case are called heterotopic xenografts.
If necessary, the tumors from the first-generation avatar mice can be extracted, divided into pieces, and implanted again in multiple avatar mice (“second generation”). This process can be repeated several times to obtain a large number of avatar mice from a single patient. In general, 3-4 generations are needed to obtain enough avatar mice from a single patient.
Step three
Once the desired number of avatar mice has been achieved, the mice are treated with the several available options of chemotherapy (single agents or combined agents). The response of the tumors in the avatar mice to the various chemotherapeutic regimens is examined and the most efficient one is chosen.
The whole process usually takes several months. If the tumor of the patient recurs, then the oncologist can decide which chemotherapeutic treatment to apply based on the response of the avatar mice that carried the original tumor of the patient.
In Practice
The therapeutic benefits of the avatar mice have been demonstrated in pilot studies by Dr. Manuel Hidalgo with pancreatic cancer patients as well as with other cancers.

In mathematics, a gradually varied surface is a special type of digital surfaces. It is a function from a 2D digital space (see digital geometry) to an ordered set or a chain.
A gradually varied function is a function from a digital space to where and are real numbers. This function possesses the following property: If x and y are two adjacent points in , assume , then , , or .
The concept of the continuous function in digital space (can be called digitally continuous functions) was proposed by Azriel Rosenfeld in 1986. It is a function in which the value (an integer) at a digital point is the same or almost the same as its neighbors. In other words, if x and y are two adjacent points in a digital space, |f(x) − f(y)| ≤ 1.
So we can see that the gradually varied function is defined to be more general than the digitally continuous function. The gradually varied function was defined by L. Chen in 1989.
An extension theorem related to above functions was mentioned by Rosenfeld (1986) and completed by Chen (1989). This theorem states: Let and . The necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of the gradually varied extension of is : for each pair of points and in , assume and , we have , where is the (digital) distance between and .
The gradually varied surface has direct relationship to graph homomorphism.

The Abu Safah field () is a joint petroleum reservoir between the waters of Bahrain and Saudi Arabia. Discovered in 1963, the field began production in 1966. It is managed by Saudi Aramco and has a capacity of 300,000 barrel/day of medium petroleum.
Location
The Abu Safah field, which began production in 1966, is located in the waters of the Persian Gulf, southeast of the Berri field, and is jointly owned by the Kingdoms of Saudi Arabia and Bahrain. The current Abu Safah facilities contain ten platforms, each with six wells and five sub-platforms with their own wells within.
History
The Abu Safah field contains 6.1 billion barrels of oil and is long and wide. Discovered in 1963 and beginning production in 1966, the field helped spur expansion of the Qatif Project from 150,000 barrels/day to its current 300,000 barrels/day capacity.
Since 1996, the Kingdom has granted all production in the field to Bahrain, but Saudi Aramco markets it through the port of Ras Tanura and distributes the revenues equally between the two. Before this, Bahrain would produce 37,000 barrels/day and import up to 217,000 barrels/day through an undersea pipeline between Saudi Arabia and a refinery on the Bahraini island of Sitra.
Development
The Abu Safah reached its full 300,000 barrels/day in 2004, after $1.2 billion was spent to raise the capacity to that level.

Mayo was an electoral district which returned an MLA to the Legislative Assembly of the Yukon Territory in Canada. It was created in 1928, at a time when it was one of three districts who elected advisors to the Yukon Territorial Council. The more contemporary, final iteration of the riding was created from an amalgamation of the riding with part of the riding of Klondike. It was abolished in 1992 when it was amalgamated with the riding of Tatchun to form the riding of Mayo-Tatchun.
The district included the communities of Mayo, Keno, Elsa, and Stewart Crossing along the Silver Trail. At the time, it was one of the Yukon's nine rural ridings and was bordered by the ridings of Tatchun, Klondike, and Campbell.
It was situated on the traditional territory of the Selkirk First Nation and the First Nation of Na-Cho Nyäk Dun. As of 1970, the population of the electorate was 476 voters and by abolition (c. 1992) it was 421 voters.
History
Mayo was created as a district in the 1928 Yukon election at a time when representatives for the Yukon Territorial Council were being elected. The Yukon Territorial Council was the Yukon's political body prior to the creation of the Yukon Legislative Assembly. Although not a full legislature, the council acted as an advisory body to the Commissioner of the Yukon, and had the power to pass non-binding motions of legislation which would be forwarded to the Commissioner for consideration. Because the Commissioner retained executive authority, empowered through Ottawa, the Yukon Territorial Council was thus not a fully democratic government. Although an elected body, its powers were significantly more constrained than those of a provincial legislative assembly.
When Mayo was created in 1928, it was one of three districts with representatives on the Yukon Territorial Council along with Dawson and Whitehorse.
When partisan politics was introduced to the Yukon in the 1978 election, Mayo was one of the initial electoral districts, its communities of Mayo, Elsa, Stewart Crossing, and Keno forming the centre of much of the Yukon's mining production. Elsa at one point was the 2nd largest producer of silver in Canada and the 4th largest in the world. Keno was also known for its silver and lead mining. However, in 1989 when United Keno Hill closed its mining operations in the area of Keno and Elsa, the communities essentially shut down. Keno maintains a small population of around 15-20 people, while Elsa is abandoned. Both are maintained as sites of historical significance.
Mayo is also the former seat of New Democrat MLA Piers McDonald who became Premier of the Yukon in 1996. He ran in the Whitehorse riding of McIntyre-Takhini when Mayo was dissolved into Mayo-Tatchun in 1992.

The Comprehensive Disabled Afghans Programme (CDAP) was a United Nations agency which was run by UNOPS from 1991 to 2004 that rehabilitated over 100,000 Afghan people injured by landmines. The program manager was Peter Colerdge.
In September 2004, following an external evaluation in 2003, the UNDP took over responsibility for the program, and redeveloped it as the National Program for Action on Disability (NPAD).
The Action Program for Afghanistan estimated that 400,000 people were killed or injured by landmines in Afghanistan between 1990 and 2000. The CDAP reported that over half of the victims were men of working age, between the age of 18 and 40.
Despite a reputation of being unfair to women, the Taliban administrators encouraged women to participate in the CDAP and even allow them to work alongside men.

In statistical mechanics the Percus–Yevick approximation is a closure relation to solve the Ornstein–Zernike equation. It is also referred to as the Percus–Yevick equation. It is commonly used in fluid theory to obtain e.g. expressions for the radial distribution function. The approximation is named after Jerome K. Percus and George J. Yevick.
Derivation
The direct correlation function represents the direct correlation between two particles in a system containing N − 2 other particles. It can be represented by
where is the radial distribution function, i.e. (with w(r) the potential of mean force) and is the radial distribution function without the direct interaction between pairs included; i.e. we write . Thus we approximate c(r) by
If we introduce the function into the approximation for c(r) one obtains
This is the essence of the Percus–Yevick approximation for if we substitute this result in the Ornstein–Zernike equation, one obtains the Percus–Yevick equation:
The approximation was defined by Percus and Yevick in 1958.
Hard spheres
For hard spheres, the potential u(r) is either zero or infinite, and therefore the Boltzmann factor is either one or zero, regardless of temperature T. Therefore structure of a hard-spheres fluid is temperature independent. This leaves just two parameters: the hard-core radius R (which can be eliminated by rescaling distances or wavenumbers), and the packing fraction η (which has a maximum value of 0.64 for random close packing).
Under these conditions, the Percus-Yevick equation has an analytical solution, obtained by Wertheim in 1963.
Solution as C code
The static structure factor of the hard-spheres fluid in Percus-Yevick approximation can be computed using the following C function:
double py(double qr, double eta)
{
const double a = pow(1+2*eta, 2)/pow(1-eta, 4);
const double b = -6*eta*pow(1+eta/2, 2)/pow(1-eta, 4);
const double c = eta/2*pow(1+2*eta, 2)/pow(1-eta, 4);
const double A = 2*qr;
const double A2 = A*A;
const double G = a/A2*(sin(A)-A*cos(A))
+ b/A/A2*(2*A*sin(A)+(2-A2)*cos(A)-2)
+ c/pow(A,5)*(-pow(A,4)*cos(A)+4*((3*A2-6)*cos(A)+A*(A2-6)*sin(A)+6));
return 1/(1+24*eta*G/A);
}

William Vito Pollina (born June 25, 1961) is an American film and television writer, producer and director.
Pollina was born in Harvey, Illinois to Italian immigrants from Sicily. He studied theater at the American Academy of Dramatic Arts (AADA). Pollina was a theater fan, and would promote concerts and plays at an early age. His first film role was a bit part in Richard Rush's slapstick cop drama Freebie and the Bean.
After high school in San Mateo, CA., Pollina moved to Los Angeles where he worked various jobs pursuing an acting career, and eventually moved into production work. One of his first jobs was working with children's television producers Sid and Marty Krofft.
During the 1980s and 1990s, he ran a film and television marketing company called Optical Nerve. Beyond writing, producing and directing hundreds of trailers and TV spots, Pollina designed and created the first DVD interactive menu for home video specialist Warren Lieberfarb at Warner Home Video, for Clint Eastwood's Academy Award winning film Unforgiven.
Pollina was President of Optical Nerve when it served as one of Fox Sports Net's marketing companies during FSN's initial launch. He left marketing to pursue television and film development in 2000 and teamed with several television writers to produce award-winning short films such as 2002's Mackenheim.
His first film success was with 2004's You Got Served, a film about street dance battling and B-boying. The film opened at No. 1 at the box office and received two MTV Movie Award nominations.
In addition to his work in film and television, Billy Pollina has been an activist for LGBTQ rights since the 1980s and the onset of the AIDS crisis. He served as marketing director for The Courage Campaign and was one of the founding organizers for The National Equality March in Washington D.C. in 2009.
Pollina spends his time in Los Angeles, the San Francisco Bay Area and New York.

The 1905 Wabash Little Giants football team represented Wabash College during the 1905 college football season. Although the team ended the season with six wins and six losses, the team managed one of its most impressive upsets when it defeated Notre Dame, 5–0, at South Bend. It proved to be the Fighting Irish's only home-field loss in 125 games between 1899 and 1928. Notre Dame had originally considered the game a "practice game" and expected to win easily when the game was scheduled the previous year, but began to take the team more seriously as the 1905 season developed.

The opening lead is the first card played in the playing phase of a contract bridge deal. The defender sitting to the left (LHO) of the declarer is the one who makes the opening lead. Since it is the only card played while dummy's cards are still concealed, it can be critical for the outcome of the deal. Making the best opening lead is a combination of selecting the best suit and then the best card within that suit.
Selecting the suit
Considerations are:
Good suits to lead may be:
a suit partner has bid
a suit not bid by declarer's side
a suit bid by declarer's partner
Against a suit contract:
a short suit lead may be good, but only when it is likely that partner will be able to obtain the lead and return the suit.
but leading a suit containing an ace may be bad
Against NT contracts
leading a long suit may be good
leading a suit in which partner could have length may be good
Choosing an aggressive or safe lead is important:
defeating some contracts calls for aggressive leads, while others call for safe leads. For example, take a look at the following deal:
North and South have reached a contract of 4, which has some possibilities. At first glance the declarer seems to be losing a spade, a heart, maybe a diamond if the finesse fails and a club or maybe more. However, if the opening lead is the 2 (a safe lead) Declarer will find it much easier to make the contract because he will have time to set up the diamond suit. The 4 lead (an aggressive lead) will make his job more difficult.
the best of both worlds is a lead that is both aggressive and safe, for example leading a suit headed by an honour sequence will give little away and may well set up tricks for the defence
Selecting the card
Partnerships may choose their own method of "carding". The following is considered fairly standard (mainly Klinger 1994 ):
Leading a singleton against a suit contract is recommended only when defender has a trump stop
Other short suit (two or three cards) leads:
from a doubleton lead the higher card, thus from 93 lead the 9
from a three card suit
if headed by an honour (not a sequence) lead the lowest, thus from Q92 lead the 2
if all cards are low, there are three schools of thought:
TON "top of nothing" – lead the top card. It has the advantage of denying an honour, but is ambiguous with a lead from doubleton,
MUD "middle-up-down" – lead the middle card, and play the highest card next.
the lowest card (least popular)
if headed by a sequence (even two cards) lead the highest. From QJ2 lead the Q
long suit (four cards or more) leads:
from a sequence of honours lead the highest, thus from KQJx lead the K
from a suit containing an internal sequence lead the top of that sequence, thus from KJ109 lead the J
from a suit headed by an honour, defender generally leads the fourth best card, allowing partner to employ the Rule of 11
from an honourless suit, the highest or second-highest is normally led, especially against suit contracts; some partnerships lead fourth best against notrump though.
From hands containing both A and K
from AKx or AKxx etc. lead the A
from AK doubleton lead the K
Against a suit contract, many partnerships reserve a special meaning for the lead of a 10 .. it promises a touching card J or 9 and a non-touching higher honour e.g. K J10, K 109, Q 109.
Difficulties
Ambiguities can arise from this standard method, thus:
A defender would lead the 2 from K532 and from K32 ... does he have a four-card suit or not?
Similarly a defender may lead the 2 from 9432 and from KJ92 ... does he have an honour or not?
A defender would lead A from AK2 or from A32 ... does he have the K or not?
A defender would lead the K from AK doubleton and from KQx ... does he have the A or the Q?
To overcome these problems various conventions have been devised:
Rusinow leads - overcomes the ambiguity of a K lead:
When West leads the K East may be confused as to the nature of his holding. If he is leading from KQ East will want to encourage, but if leading from AK East will want to discourage. Rusinow leads recommend leading the second of touching honours and the above confusion is largely eliminated. Rusinow leads are now considered a standard part of the Roman Club system.
Journalist leads - overcomes the ambiguity of a J lead.
The leader might have J1094 or KJ104. The convention proposes that the opening lead be the Jack from the first sequence and the 10 from the second in order to better inform his partner about the nature of his holding.

Sogn Parcazi Castle and Church (Romansh: Crap Sogn Parcazi, also Hohentrins) is a ruined castle and fortified church in the municipality of Trin of the Canton of Graubünden in Switzerland. It is a Swiss heritage site of national significance.
Castle name
The castle is known as Crap Sogn Parcazi (Romansh: The Rock of St. Pancras) after the hill that it stands on. It is also referred to individually as Hohentrins Castle or together with Canaschal Castle also as Hohentrins. Additionally Hohentrin could refer to the region around Trin.
History
The early chronicles of the region list Pepin, the father of Charlemagne, as the founder of the castle. While this is unlikely, it has not been conclusively disproven. Regardless of whether it is true, the first church on the site may date to the 8th century and may have been built on an even older pre-Christian cult site. It was originally built as a fortified church and refuge castle and may have been the first parish church of Tamins and Trin. In the 9th or 10th century the Emperor combined the imperial estates of Trin, Tamins and Reichenau, Switzerland into the Herrschaft of Hohentrin and granted it to Reichenau Abbey. Over the following centuries the complex was expanded and gradually converted into a feudal castle. The first residential building on the site was built in the 11th or 12th century when a tower was added. The palas on the northern end was probably built around 1300.
The castle first appears in historical records in the early 14th century. In 1314 the Herrschaft of Hohentrins passed from Reichenau Abbey to the Freiherr von Frauenberg. By 1325 it was owned by Count Hugo III von Werdenberg-Heiligenberg. In 1360 there was a fight between the local minor nobility and the Werdenberg-Heiligenberg and Werdenberg-Sargans families, but nothing is recorded as happening to Sogn Parcazi. At some point in the next two decades the castle was given as collateral to Ulrich Brun von Rhäzüns, because in 1383 Hugo and Heinrich von Werdenberg-Heiligenberg had to repay Ulrich Brun. In 1398 they pawned the castle again, this time to Albrecht von Werdenberg-Bludenz who was a supporter of the Habsburgs. However, a few months later Rudolf and Heinrich von Werdenberg-Heiligenberg as the owners of the castle joined the anti-Habsburg Grey League.
In 1428 the last male member of the Werdenberg-Heiligenberg family, Hugo, died and the castle and herrschaft passed to Peter von Hewen. The von Hewen family appointed vogts to administer the castle and lands for them. The last vogt at Sogn Parcazi was the Vogt Otto Capol. On 2 July 1470 he and his wife traveled to Reichnau for a celebration. While they were gone a fire broke out in the castle, destroying it and killing three of the vogt's children and their maid. One theory is that the fire was set by debtors who owed the vogt money in order to destroy the documents recording their loans. The castle was never rebuilt and Vogt Capol received a title in Lugnez. Later records continue to record that there were vogts over Hohentrins until 1524, but it is unknown whether they lived at Canaschal Castle or in the village. The herrschaft went to Johann von Planta in 1568, followed by Wolfgang von Löwenstein-Wertheim in 1583 and the Lords of Schauenstein in 1585. In 1616 the municipality of Trin bought their freedom from the Schauenstein family.
The castle was partly excavated in 1931 but the conservation project ran out of money and some of the excavated walls collapsed. During World War II the Swiss Army took over Sogn Parcazi and built two bunkers on the hill. After the war, the army remained responsible for the ruins and in 1964 they were re-excavated, repaired and reinforced. The ruins were turned over to the municipality in 2004 and from 2006 until 2010 they were again repaired and an archeological excavation revealed much of the castle's history.
Castle site
The ruins of the castle are located on a steep hill west of Trin village. The ruins of the Church of St. Pancras are located in the center of the flat top of the hill. The simple church building is oriented along an approximate east-west axis. It dates from about 1100 and may have replaced an earlier church. A rectangular cistern or baptistery was added in the 12th century. The 11th or 12th century tower south of the tower is with walls that are up to thick. The palas to the north was added in the 13th century and is long.

The prime minister of Belgium (; ; ) or the premier of Belgium is the head of the federal government in the Kingdom of Belgium.
Although leaders of Government (French: ) had been appointed since the independence of the country, until 1918 the king often presided over the Council of Ministers, so the modern era of the "premiership" started after World War I with Léon Delacroix. The political importance of the king of the Belgians has decreased over time, whereas the position of prime minister has gradually become more important.

Jean Bouhier (16 March 1673, Dijon – 17 March 1746, Dijon) was a French magistrate, jurisconsultus, historian, translator, bibliophile and scholar. He served as the first président à mortier to the parlement de Bourgogne from 1704 to 1728, when he resigned to devote himself to his historic and literary work following his 1727 election to the Académie française.
Biography
From the rich Bouhier family (his brother Claude Bouhier de Lantenay became the second bishop of Dijon in 1744), Jean Bouhier had a vast network of correspondents rights across Europe. The Eltons write of him:
He was renowned as much for his erudition as for the splendid library he had inherited from his ancestors, which he expanded and put at the disposal of the poets and writers he welcomed to his hôtel on rue Vauban in Dijon. At the end of his life the library held 35,000 works and 2,000 manuscripts, but all his collections were dispersed after his death and were mostly sold to Clairvaux Abbey.
Works
Besides his treatise on Burgundian customs (considered his masterpiece), Jean Bouhier was the author of several works on jurisprudence as well as many dissertations. He also translated Latin classical texts, some in collaboration with the abbé d'Olivet, though Bouhier's translations were more appreciated by his contemporaries for their closeness to the original than for their style – his wife said to him "You take care of thinking, and leave me with the writing"
D'Alembert said of him :

Don Winslow of the Navy is a 1942 Universal Pictures Serial film based on the comic strip Don Winslow of the Navy by Commander Frank V. Martinek. It was theatrically released in January 1942.
Plot
Commander Don Winslow is returned to the Office of Naval Intelligence from his command of his cruiser to investigate strange events on the Pacific island of Tangita, noticeably a ship being torpedoed. He discovers that there is a ring of saboteurs and enemy agents who are trying to destroy ships carrying supplies to the troops stationed in the islands and sabotage the war effort. Though the US Navy is preparing to build a naval base on Tangita, an unknown foreign power secretly has a subterranean submarine base beneath the island with the goal of preventing the American base from being completed. He sets out with three assistants to find the mastermind behind the activities.
Cast
Production
The serial was based on the comic strip by Commander Frank V. Martinek, which was approved by the US Navy. The strip gained new meaning with the approach of World War II, which would also affect the serial: "Its presentation as a Universal serial in October 1941 - just before the infamous attack on Pearl Harbor in December - was one of the most timely contributions of the serial field."
The Universal serials for 1941-42 were meant to run: Riders of Death Valley, Sea Raiders, Head Hunters of the Amazon, Gang Busters. Head Hunters of the Amazon was, however, dropped in favor of this serial. This is possibly due to the greater name recognition of the licensed property over the more generic planned serial.

East (also known as North Child in the UK and Australia) is a 2003 novel by the author Edith Pattou. It is an adaptation of an old Norwegian folk tale entitled "East of the Sun and West of the Moon" and was a 2003 ALA Top Ten Best Book for Young Adults.
Plot
When Arne married the superstitious Eugenia, he agreed to have seven children with her—one for each point of the compass, excluding north. According to the birth-direction superstition held by Eugenia's family, the direction a woman faces when giving birth will affect the child's personality; each direction foretells a different personality, and Eugenia believes north is wild and uncontrollable. Years before, Eugenia was told by a skjebne-soke (a fortune teller) that any north child she had would die crushed beneath an avalanche of ice and snow, reinforcing her desire to never have a pure northern child. Her favorite child, east-born Elise, dies young and Eugenia conceives another child to replace her, Rose. While pregnant with Rose, Eugenia is adamant that her unborn child will be an east-born, so much so that her very non-superstitious husband worries that she is tempting fate.
Rose feels out of place in her family, despite her love for them and her home; she can never live up to the standard set by her dead sister Elise, and is consumed by un-east-like wanderlust and desire for adventure. Her happy and loving childhood is failing: not only are they impoverished and her sick sister lying close to death, but her parents have concealed the truth of her birth-direction from her—the superstition that has hung over her entire life. Later she overhears her parents talking and finds out she is actually a north-born.
So when an enormous white bear mysteriously shows up and asks her to come away with him, in exchange for health and prosperity for her ailing family, she readily agrees. The bear takes Rose to a distant castle hidden within a mountain, where each night she is confronted with a mystery. Every night she sleeps with an unknown being that she cannot see but she can hear shivering. She also makes friend with a being named Tuki the son of the cook who teaches her some of his language.
When Rose gets homesick the white bear takes her home where she is allowed to stay for one month as long as she doesn't tell her family about her experiences with the white bear especially her mother. After a while, she tells her brother Neddy about the unknown figure in her bed and her mother overhears. When she leaves her mother gives a candle that will always light even if a strong wind is blowing.
The white bear takes her back to the castle and all is well until Rose's curiosity gets the better of her and she lights the candle. She sees that the being with her is a man. The man wakes up and screams. He tells her that he was the white bear and he could have been free if a maiden stayed with him willingly for a year without looking at his human face.
Because the man/bear failed to break his curse within a year, the troll queen who placed him under the curse comes to take him to her castle "east of the sun and west of the moon," where he will be her prisoner. Rose knows that she must save him and embarks on a quest to find the troll kingdom. On her long journey, she encounters many different people and dangerous situations.
Reception
East has received mixed reviews. Kirkus Reviews stated "Using multiple narrators, Pattou expands the Scandinavian folktale "East of the Sun and West of the Moon" to epic length—adding little to the original." and "... the pace does pick up in the second half—but only fitfully does this achieve the intensity of feeling or vividness of setting that drives the best of the recent flurry of retold romances." while Publishers Weekly saw that "Readers with a taste for fantasy and folklore will embrace Pattou's (Hero's Song) lushly rendered retelling of "East of the Sun and West of the Moon." and "Handsomely evoking a landscape filled with castles, trolls, shamans and spellbound princes, the story will exercise its audience's imagination." Inis magazine was critical writing that "Pattou has replaced the conciseness of the folktale form (her novel makes use of 'East of the Sun, West of the Moon') with a detail-oriented kind of epic exoticism, and more has been lost than gained in the exchange. This novel bludgeons the folktale into an overly rationalistic, epic narrative form that relies on exoticism for its appeal and has no meaningful historical or geographical accuracy. The novel is targeted at girls aged 12+. Its lengthiness could discourage reluctant readers while its fundamental weaknesses may irritate stronger readers."
Sequel
West, the sequel to East, was published in October, 2018. Pattou described it as, "a fantasy/adventure in which the wandering adventurer Rose embarks on a quest to rescue her kidnapped infant and learn the fate of her true love."

Ogle County is a county in the northern part of the U.S. state of Illinois. According to the 2010 United States Census, it had a population of 53,497. Its county seat is Oregon, and its largest city is Rochelle. Ogle County comprises Rochelle, IL Micropolitan Statistical Area, which is also included in the Rockford-Freeport-Rochelle, IL Combined Statistical Area.
History
Ogle County was formed in 1836 out of Jo Daviess and LaSalle counties, and named in honor of Captain Joseph Ogle, a veteran of the Revolutionary War who settled in Illinois in 1785. Ogle County government was organized in 1837; before that time it remained assigned to Jo Daviess County for legislative, taxation, and judicial matters. In 1839, part of Ogle County was partitioned off to form Lee County.
Ogle County was a New England settlement. The founders of Oregon and Rochelle arrived from New England; they were "Yankees", descendants of English Puritans who had settled New England in the 1600s. They were part of a wave of farmers who migrated into the Northwest Territory in the early 1800s, their trek eased by completion of the Erie Canal in 1825. They found virgin forest and wild prairie, and quickly laid out farms, constructed roads, erected government buildings and established post routes. They brought a passion for education and strong abolitionism. They were members of the Congregationalist or Episcopalian Church. Culturally Ogle County, like much of northern Illinois would maintain values similar to those of New England.

Phineas Bowles (died 1722) was an English army major-general.
Life
The subject's father was Valentine, his uncle was Colonel John Seymour, Governor of Maryland , and a brother named Tobias, a London merchant, was nominated to succeed his uncle as Royal Governor of Maryland. Bowles served in the Admiralty as a secretary from 6 March 1689 until 15 January 1690. Bowles is first mentioned in the Military Entry Books in January 1692, when he was appointed captain-lieutenant in the regiment of Colonel W. Selwyn, later the 2nd Queen's, then just arrived in Holland from Ireland. In July 1705 he succeeded Colonel Caulfield in command of a regiment of foot in Ireland, with which he went to Spain and served at the Siege of Barcelona.
According to the memoranda of General Erie, Bowles's was one of the regiments broken at the bloody battle of Almanza. It appears to have been reorganised in England, as Narcissus Luttrell mentions Bowles's arrival in England on parole, and afterwards that he was at Portsmouth with his regiment, awaiting embarkation with some troops supposed to be destined for Newfoundland. Instead, he again went with his Regiment to Spain, where it was distinguished at the battle of Saragossa in 1710, and was one of the regiments surrounded in the mountains of Castile, and made prisoners, in December of the same year.
After this Bowles's regiment disappeared from the rolls, and its colonel remained unemployed until 1715, when, as a brigadier-general, he was commissioned to raise a corps of dragoons, of six troops, in Berkshire, Hampshire, and Buckinghamshire, to rendezvous at Reading. This corps became the 12th Royal Lancers. In 1719 Bowles was transferred to the colonelcy of a Regiment of Dragoons. Brigadier General Bowles was replaced in 1721 at Dublin Castle by Philip Honywood, Esq.
He died in 1722. His cousin's son Phineas Bowles (1690–1749) was a lieutenant-general.

Rose Garden is a multi-million selling, RIAA Platinum-certified studio album by country singer Lynn Anderson. It was released in late 1970 as the title song was climbing country and pop music charts around the world. The single went on to top the Country charts, where it stayed at the number 1 position for five weeks. It reached number 3 on the Billboard Hot 100 pop chart in early 1971 and hit number 1 in both Cash Box and Record World. It was an international top five pop hit in numerous countries. Anderson received a Grammy Award for Best Female Country Vocal Performance for the record. It would remain the biggest selling album by a female country artist for 27 years (1970-1997).
The album went platinum in the United States, arguably the first female country artist release to do so (Tammy Wynette's Greatest Hits from 1969 also went platinum but given that the RIAA did not officially have "platinum" records until 1976 there was no way to tell which album reached the sales mark first; Columbia/Epic gave Anderson and Wynette each platinum record trophies in late 1972.) The album Rose Garden continued to sell well for over a decade and later managed to receive an official platinum record as well for sales post-1976.
The album Rose Garden hit the Billboard country album chart on December 26, 1970 and by the February 13th issue had climbed to number 1 on the chart where it would remain for 14 weeks, the longest run at the top of that chart for any country female vocalist until Shania Twain's The Woman in Me album in 1995, 25 years later. Rose Garden still ranks among the top 50 country albums of alltime in the history of the country album chart. The disc peaked at number 19 on the Billboard 200 albums pop chart, by far Anderson's best showing on that chart. The album was also nominated for "Album of the Year" by the Country Music Association and was in print for over 15 years. Anderson was also nominated for "Record of the Year" for the single of "Rose Garden" and won the Female Vocalist of the Year award at the same ceremonies breaking Tammy Wynette's three-year winning streak.
Later releases
This album, together with the 1972 "Greatest Hits" album, was reissued on the Super Audio CD format in 2018 by UK label Dutton Vocalion, Remastered in both Stereo and Surround Sound from the original analogue tapes by Michael J. Dutton and released as a 2-fer with "Greatest Hits".

Golden Beach is a coastal suburb of Caloundra in the Sunshine Coast Region, Queensland, Australia. It is located within the Caloundra urban centre directly southwest of the Caloundra CBD. In the , Golden Beach had a population of 5,575 people.
Geography
Golden Beach is a coastal suburb with the Pumicestone Passage forming its eastern boundary. It is mostly fully developed with low density residential housing. A canal from the passage passes through the suburb from east to west leading into the canal developments of the neighbouring suburb of Pelican Waters.
The long sandspit at the northern tip of Bribie Island protects Golden Beach from the Coral Sea. However, this section of the Pumicestone Passage is very narrow and very shallow (less than ) with shifting sand and mud banks, which makes the northern sandspit highly dynamic in shape through natural processes of sand/mud buildup and erosion. During storms, waves may cross over the sandspit from the Coral Sea into the Pumicestone Passage, with the potential to break through the sandspit to create new entrances to Pumicestone Passage. The creation of new entrances would impact on Golden Beach and Pelican Waters, which would then be exposed more directly to the stronger wave action of the Coral Sea as opposed to the calmer waters of the Pumicestone Passage. In December 2020 wild weather began creating channels from the ocean through the northern sandspit into Pumicestone Passage.
History
Settlement of Golden Beach dates from the late 19th century, with land used mainly for farming and grazing. Development of the suburb started from the 1950s, with rapid growth from the 1960s into the 1980s. The suburb was named by the Caloundra Golden Beach Ltd, the developers of the area.
Golden Beach State School opened on 24 January 1983.
In the , Golden Beach had a population of 5,575 people.
Education
Golden Beach State School is a government primary (Prep-6) school for boys and girls at Gregory Street (). In 2017, the school had an enrolment of 657 students with 51 teachers (44 full-time equivalent) and 33 non-teaching staff (23 full-time equivalent). It includes a special education program.
There are no secondary schools in Golden Beach; the nearest secondary school is Caloundra State High School in neighbouring Caloundra.

Ulmu is a settlement in Ialoveni District, Republic of Moldova. It is situated in the middle of the largest forest in Moldova, Codrii Moldovei. The soil of this zone, a type of chernozem, is favorable for various kinds of plantations. Currently, the most grown cultures are common for the central zone of Moldova, some of them are grapes, corn, cherry and sour cherry trees and many more. The Botna River, which crosses the village, is a tributary of the Nistru River. The river can dry out completely during summer months. The river doesn't cause floods, due to its low depth and pollution.
Ulmu is located strategically, at equal distances from Chișinău, and the Romanian border and other villages from the same district.
The E581 highway is being constructed in the vicinity.
Etymology
It is believed that the name of the village is derived from a kind of tree that is specific to this region, Ulmus (from Latin Ulmus). Unfortunately this kind of tree, due to the human activity, is rare, because of its usage in peoples' households and farms.
Ulmu today
Ulmu is a village with a medium count of inhabitants. Due to the immigration, the population count have been suffered a decline.
The education in Ulmu is provided by a high school and a kindergarten. The high school from this village is named after the well-known, Romanian writer, Mihai Eminescu, there is also a post office, a newly built hospital (from 2011), some stores and a culture house. As of 2010, the construction of a new auto magistrale has begun. It aims to link the neighboring villages of Văsieni, Ruseștii Noi and Ulmu itself to the European magistrale M1 directly. There are some negotiations with the government to allocate funds to pave the road. The mobile phone and 3G internet coverage is being provided by 3-4 antennas which are situated on village's key points. There is also a cable operator, which is very popular here. The buses and minibuses circulate according to an established schedule from Chisinau, it takes around 30–40 minutes to get from Ulmu to Chisinau and vice versa.
Both young men and old men are privileged by the village hall. Thus, the village has many attractions for the youth, like soccer fields, libraries, playgrounds and for the old men it has a public eatery and a nursing home.

Advent and Triumph of Christ is an oil painting on a panel of wood, painted c.1480 by German-born Early Netherlandish painter Hans Memling. It was made for the altar of the Tanners' guild in Our Lady's Church in Bruges, but is now held by the Alte Pinakothek in Munich.
The painting shows 25 episodes from the Life of Christ (although some have interpreted it as a version of the Seven Joys of the Virgin) combined in one narrative composition without a central dominating scene: including the Annunciation; the Annunciation to the shepherds; the Nativity; the Massacre of the Innocents; the Adoration of the Magi; the Passion; the Resurrection; the Ascension; Pentecost; the Dormition and Assumption of Mary.
A similar narrative style was employed by Memling for his earlier Scenes from the Passion of Christ (c.1470), commissioned by Tommaso Portinari and now held by the Galleria Sabauda in Turin.

Bartolomé Calatayud (8 September 1882– 11 April 1973) was a Spanish classical guitar composer, teacher and performer. He was born in 1882 on the island of Mallorca. In 1899, while still a teenager, he was awarded the Diploma of Honour 1st Class by the Workers Instructive Centre Palma for his "superior musical knowledge in guitar playing." A contemporary and friend of Miguel Llobet and Andrés Segovia, he studied guitar first with Pedro Antonio Alemany Palmer (Palma 1862–1952), and then with Antonio Gomez Melters (1839–1908). He studied harmony and composition with the great Majorcan musicologist and composer D. Antonio Noguera. Bartolomé was also taught by Francisco Tárrega in Valencia.
He gave concerts in Spain, France, Switzerland, Portugal and Algiers and toured South America with Spanish Chorus and Dance groups. In Majorca he composed many works for the classical guitar and taught the instrument. Many of his guitar works are based on popular Catalan/Majorcan folk music.
Although less famous in the classical guitar world, Bartolomé Calatayud has left much enjoyable and exciting music written for classical guitarists of all abilities. He taught many pupils in Majorca during his final years. He died in 1973 at the age of 90.

Brazil–Chile relations refers to interstate relations between Brazil and Chile. Chile and Brazil have acted numerous times as mediators in international conflicts, such as in the 1914 diplomatic impasse between the United States and Mexico, avoiding a possible state of war between those two countries. More recently, since the 2004 Haiti rebellion, Chile and Brazil have participated in the United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti, which is led by the Brazilian Army.
According to a 2014 BBC World Service Poll, 62% of Chileans view Brazil's influence positively, with only 12% expressing a negative view.
History
During much of the 19th and the 20th centuries, conflicts with Argentina over Uruguay and Paraguay on behalf of Brazil and over Patagonia on behalf of Chile made Brazil and Chile close allies. During the War of the Pacific, with Chile fighting against Peru and Bolivia, Brazil provided tacit support for Chile, forced Argentina which attempted to join the Peruvian–Bolivian alliance, to stay neutral throughout the war.
On May 20, 1914, Argentina, Brazil and Chile (the ABC countries) met in Niagara Falls, Canada, to mediate diplomatically to avoid a state of war between the United States and Mexico over the Veracruz Incident and the Tampico Affair.
On May 15, 1915, the three met again to sign a more formal treaty. The Consultation, Non-Aggression, and Arbitration Pact was designed to foment co-operation, non-aggression and the arbitration of disputes. It was formulated to resist American influence in the region and to establish a mechanism for consultation among the three signatory countries, such as by setting up a permanent mediation commission.

The Washington Benevolent Societies (the "WBS") were grass-roots political clubs set up 1808-1816 by the Federalist Party in the U.S. to electioneer for votes. As shown on the membership certificates printed within copies of "Washington's Farewell Address" that were issued to members, the first of these societies was "instituted in the City of New York, on the 12th day of July, 1808." The President of that first WBS was Isaac Sebring [perhaps the Federalist merchant described in "The Old Merchants of New York City]. and Secretary was G. C. Verplanck (perhaps Guilan Crommelin Verplanck, Sr.). Societies were also formed in Rhode Island in 1810, as the threat of warfare loomed. Citing a July 6, 1812 edition of the "Federalist" newspaper in New Jersey, it has been reported that: "Coinciding with the first state peace convention, the initial public appearance of the Washington Benevolent Society in New Jersey occurred in Trenton on July 4, 1812."
The WBS helped pioneer electioneering techniques in a democracy. "The promise of participation in the parade and receipt of the badge of the Society had been used as part of the Trenton Society's membership drive, for the Federalists were interested in gaining as many members as possible." Ribbon badges with George Washington's portrait and the words "Pro Patria" ("For Country") printed on silk or vellum were issued to members of the Societies. "Silk ribbons bearing Washington's portrait issued by the society are among the earliest mass-produced partisan objects in American political history."
Into the Age of Jackson, an oration on Washington's birthday, February 22, was commonly delivered before the Washington Benevolent Societies in various states, and sometimes it would be printed.

Henry James Coleridge (born 20 September 1822, in Devon, England; d. Roehampton, 13 April 1893) was a writer on religious affairs and preacher.
Life
He was the son of Sir John Taylor Coleridge, a Judge of the King's Bench, and brother of John Coleridge, 1st Baron Coleridge, Chief Justice of England. His grandfather, Captain James Coleridge, was brother of Samuel Taylor Coleridge, the poet and philosopher.
He was sent to Eton at the age of thirteen and thence to Oxford, having obtained a scholarship at Trinity College. His university career was distinguished; in 1844 he took the highest honours in a fellowship at Oriel, then the blue ribbon of the university. In 1848 he received Anglican orders. The Tractarian movement being then at its height, Coleridge, with many of his tutors and friends, joined its ranks and was an ardent disciple of John Henry Newman till his conversion.
Gradually various incidents, the secession of Newman, Dr. Renn Hampden's appointment as Regius Professor of Theology, the condemnation and suspension of Edward Bouverie Pusey, the condemnation and deprivation of William George Ward, and the decision in the Gorham case, seriously shook his confidence in the Church of England. In consequence Edward Hawkins, Provost of Oriel, declined to admit him as a college tutor, and he therefore accepted a curacy at Alphington, a parish recently separated from that of Ottery St Mary, the home of his family, where his father had built for him a house and school. His doubts as to his religious position continued, however, to grow and early in 1852 he determined that he could no longer remain in the Anglican Communion.
Conversion to Catholicism
On Quinquagesima Sunday (22 February) he bade farewell to Alphington, and in April, after a retreat at Clapham under the Redemptorist Fathers, he was received into the Catholic Church. Determined to be a priest he proceeded in the following September to Rome and entered the Accademia dei Nobili, where he had for companions several of his Oxford friends, and others, including the future Cardinals Manning and Vaughan. He was ordained in 1856 and six months later took the degree of S.T.D. In the summer of 1857 he returned to England, and on 7 September entered the Jesuit Novitiate, which was then at Beaumont Lodge, Old Windsor, his novice master being Father Thomas Tracy Clarke, for whom to the end of his life he entertained the highest admiration and esteem.
The Month
In 1859 he was sent to the Theological College of St. Beuno's, North Wales, as a professor of Scripture, and remained there until, in 1865, he was called to London to become the first Jesuit editor of The Month, a magazine started under Frances Margaret Taylor in the previous year and subsequently sold to the Jesuits. He continued as editor for more than fifteen years.
After the death of Father William Maher, in 1877, he added the editorship of the Messenger of the Sacred Heart, for which he was one of the most prolific writers. He projected and carried on the Quarterly Series to which he himself largely contributed, both with his work The Public Life of Our Lord and others, such as The Life and Letters of St. Francis Xavier and The Life and Letters of St. Teresa. He also wrote a Harmony of the Gospels, Vita Vitae Nostrae, a favourite book for meditation, published also in an English version. And he wrote studies based on the New Testament, an interest which seems to have been partly acquired from his old Oxford tutor, Isaac Williams.
For a time he was also superior of his religious brethren in Farm Street, London. In 1881 failing health obliged him to resign The Month to another Oxonian, Father Richard F. Clarke, but he continued to work on The Life of Our Lord. In 1890 a paralytic seizure compelled him to withdraw to the novitiate at Roehampton, where he finished the work before passing away. The chief sources for his life are articles in The Month, June, 1893, by his friend James Patterson, Bishop of Emmaus, and the Jesuit Father Richard F. Clarke.

An automatic trip is an action performed by some system, usually a Safety Instrumented System, Programmable Logic Controller, or Distributed Control System, to put an industrial process into a safe state. It is triggered by some parameter going into a pre-determined unsafe state. It is usually preceded by an alarm to give a process operator a chance to correct the condition to prevent the trip, since trips are usually costly because of lost production.

He won the PRASEG Parliamentarian of the Year Award in 2006 for his work in promoting renewable energy.
In 2008, Lazarowicz lodged a further Private Member's Bill to restrict ship-to-ship oil transfers, with the aim of preventing spillages in the Firth of Forth. In response, the government introduced regulations to restrict such transfers in April 2010 which were then delayed, but eventually were brought into force.
In October 2008, Lazarowicz was made the Prime Minister's Special Representative on Global Carbon Markets and his report on the issue, Global Carbon Trading: a framework for reducing emissions was published in July 2009.
In the 2009 MP expenses scandal, the independent investigation by Sir Thomas Legg reported that Lazarowicz had no issues with his claims. He was therefore not required by Legg to make any repayments of his expenses.
He rebelled against the Labour government on the Iraq war vote in 2003, and on a number of other issues including the Digital Economy Bill and the Data Retention and Investigatory Powers Bill. He also opposed the Conservative government's Immigration Bill and retrospective legislation on workfare.
Lazarowicz was defeated at the 2015 general election by the Scottish National Party's Deidre Brock.
Later career
Following his defeat in the 2015, Lazarowicz returned to legal practice. His legal specialisms include public law, judicial review and human rights, immigration and asylum, personal injury, and planning and environmental law. He is the joint author of "The Scottish Parliament: An Introduction", published in 1999 with new editions in 2000, 2003 and 2010. This was published as a revised work in a new edition in 2018, with the title "The Scottish Parliament: Law and Practice"
Personal life
Lazarowicz is married with four children. He has been a supporter of many environmental causes, and in 2015 he was elected as an Honorary Fellow of Scottish Environment Link.

Charles Cornelisz. de Hooch (c.1600 – 2 July 1638), was a Dutch Golden Age landscape painter and etcher.
Biography
He became known as Karel de Hooge from being listed in Samuel Ampzing's lof der Haerlem as a painter of ruins, along with Pieter Molyn, Jacob Pinas and Salomon de Bray, who was born in 1597. He is best known today for his so-called grotto paintings. Grotto painting as an independent genre was probably initiated by a group of followers of Cornelis van Poelenburch, which included De Hooch along with Abraham van Cuylenborch and Dirck Stoop. His contemporaries in landscape painting included Esaias and Jan van de Velde, Pieter Dircksz Santvoort, Pieter Molyn and Salomon Ruysdael.
Charles was probably born in Haarlem, since Ampzing included him, but this is not totally certain. It is accepted that he lived in Haarlem up until 1628, the year of publication of Ampzing's book. Ampzing wrote a whole verse of poetry about him:
(And would I hereby deem de Hooch worthy)
(of enhancing his dignity with praise?)
(Do you want to see ruins, true to life?)
(You recognize his mastery and refinement.)
After his Haarlem period he moved to Utrecht, where he died 2 July 1638 leaving underage children. His life can thus be divided in his Haarlem period (from birth up until at least 1628) and his Utrecht period (From 1628 up until his death in 1638). In Utrecht he belonged to a group of painters that included Bartholomeus Breenbergh, Abraham van Cuylenburch, Rombout van Troyen and P. van Hattick.
Charles Cornelisz. de Hooch was married to Claesgen van Thiel (1629-07-11 - 1671-06-20) and they had one son Horatius (? - after 1686) who in turn married Wilhelmina van Swoll.
After he donated a painting to the ‘St. Jobs Gasthuis' in 1628, he was introduced into the Utrecht Guild of St. Luke in 1633.
Charles Cornelisz. de Hooch is not the father of the famous painter of interiors Pieter de Hooch, as is often mentioned. C.H.C. Flugi van Aspermont argues that this is not true, though Het schildersregister by Jan Sysmus, doctor of the city of Amsterdam, which was published by Dr. Abraham Bredius in Oud Holland VIII, mentions (p. 222) ‘Karel de Hoogh, vader van Pieter' and on p. 307 ‘'. P. Haverkorn van Rijsewijk writes in Oud-Holland X, p. 172, that he found a testament (dating 21 dec 1657) saying: “Henrick de Hoge, metselaer benoemt SIJN SOON Pieter de Hooch, schilder”. Which implies that not Charles Cornelisz. de Hooch, but Henrick de Hoge is Pieter's father. Pieter de Hoogh lived in the same street as Hendrik de Hoogh during his marriage. A Hendrik de Hoogh was a witness during the baptism of Pieter's daughter Anna. Pieter's age coincides with the age on Hendrik's son Pieter's baptising.
Works and style
His works are very rare, but most of them are easily recognised by his distinguished signature.
Works of Haarlem Period (1624-1628)
The earliest works of de Hooch are dated around 1620, and were produced in Haarlem. These realistic paintings of the Dutch landscape belong, according to Flugi van Aspermont to the oldest school of Haarlem landscape painters, which distanced itself from the Flemish school of landscape painting.
An example of one of those landscapes can be found in his Landscape with Travelers underneath a Dovecote. In the centre of this panel there is a wooden dovecote build on three trees; a man in a red shirt and blue pants is standing on a ladder which is placed to it. On the right is a ruin of a castle with a stork's nest. In front of it there is a man accompanied by a dog. In the background there are trees surrounded by a clouded sky. This theme of a dovecote is also painted in a canvas painting in 1628, the year he moved to Utrecht, which de Hooch painted in Haarlem. At the bottom of the right is it signed “Chaerles dhooch”
These two paintings of dovecotes look largely the same in terms of content, with the exception of the buildings in the right side. On the panel this is a ruin of a castle, while on the canvas this is a regular building. De Hooch was particularly admired for his ability to paint ruins, according to Ampzing.
Works of Utrecht Period (1628-1638)
His Utrecht period is characterized by Italianate landscapes and grotto paintings. The seventeenth century Dutch Italianate grotto painting that is characteristic of De Hooch's Utrecht period owes its inception to Cornelis van Poelenbergh of Utrecht. Poelenbergh traveled to the south and, upon his return to Utrecht in the mid-1620s, he continued to depict Italianate landscapes featuring ruins and grottos. De Hooch was most likely involved in initiating this subject matter as an independent genre, along with other followers of Poelenbergh. De Hooch's Italianate landscapes can be clearly associated with those of Poelenburgh and Breenbergh, however it is not known whether he learned about Italianate motifs on a trip south or from Poelenburgh and Breenbergh after they returned to Holland from their own trips to south. De Hooch is known for his intriguing paintings of dramatically lit and spooky grottos which feature classical sculpture and architectural fragments. In his painting Italian landscape with ruins and duck hunters, which is estimated to be completed sometime between 1630 and 1635, a clear connection to the work of Poelenburgh and Breenbergh can be seen. The simple design of the piece and the “solid, monumental composition is accompanied by firmer, more tangible modeling details”.
Best known works
‘De duiventil - Charles DHooch', Panel 27x32, in Museum Kunstliefde in Utrecht
‘De grot - Charles D. Hooch f.' Panel, 53x79, in Fredensborg Palace in Kopenhagen
‘De Catacomben, panel 68x93, in the collection Prince Charles d'Arenberg in Brussel
An interesting case are two landscapes with ruins in Suermondt-Ludwig-Museum of Aken (nr 67 and 68 of their 1883 catalogue), are both wrongly attributed to Pieter de Hooch (according to Dr. Hofstede de Groot), because Pieter never painted landscapes. Although Arnold Houbraken thought that he was a pupil of Nicolaes Berchem, it could be that these were Carel de Hooch's paintings.
De Hooch family of artists
Charles Cornelisz. de Hooch is not the father of the famous painter of interiors Pieter de Hooch, as is often mentioned. C.H.C. Flugi van Aspermont argues that this is not true, though Het schildersregister by Jan Sysmus, doctor of the city of Amsterdam, which was published by Dr. Abraham Bredius in Oud Holland VIII, mentions (p.222) ‘Karel de Hoogh, vader van Pieter' and on p. 307 ‘'. P. Haverkorn van Rijsewijk writes in Oud-Holland X, p. 172, that he found a testament (dating 21 dec 1657) saying: “Henrick de Hoge, metselaer benoemt SIJN SOON Pieter de Hooch, schilder”.

A Hendrik de Hoogh was a witness during the baptism of Pieter's daughter Anna. Pieter's age coincides with the age on Hendrik's son Pieter's baptising. Charles Cornelisz de Hooch was possibly the brother of Dirck Cornelis de Hooch.

Sir Frederic James Osborn (1885–1978) was a leading member of the UK Garden city movement and was chairman of the Town and Country Planning Association. He lived in Welwyn Garden City with his wife and fellow campaigner Lady Margaret Paterson Osborn, the garden city he helped create, and a local school (Sir Frederic Osborn School) was named after him in 1968.
Life
Born in 1885 in London, he left school at 15 for a job as an office boy. He attended night-school. He joined the Fabian Society, where he edited Fabian Nursling, as the magazine of the youth cohort was called.
In 1912, he took a job as secretary-manager of the Howard Cottage Society in Letchworth Garden City, founded by Ebenezer Howard. It was here that he formed the view that Government intervention was essential if new settlements were to be developed, setting this out as early as 1918 in an article on "The public control of the location of towns". This was a case he also made elsewhere under the pseudonym Edward Ormiston.
In 1916 Osborn married Margaret Paterson Robb, whom he had met at a summer school of the Fabian Society. Margaret had a major beneficial influence on his subsequent life and the Garden City Movement.
In 1919 Howard purchased land for a second garden city at Welwyn, and Osborn moved with him to become Company Secretary and Estate Manager. The Frederic and Margaret Osborn became pioneer residents in Welwyn Garden City, where, alongside Frederic, Margaret dedicated herself to the town's social welfare and educational and cultural interests. This included establishing the Welwyn Garden City Branch of the United Nations Association, of which she became President.
Frederic left the company in 1936, and devoted the rest of his life to promoting the garden city movement. He objected to the expansion of towns on the basis this imposed a burden of commuting which would be carry implications for cost, time and leisure. From 1938 onwards he advocated for the establishment of a London Regional Planning Commission with powers to establish boards to build new towns or expand existing ones. He was 61 when the New Towns Act he had been lobbying for received Royal Assent in 1946.
Osborn was a socialist and member of the Labour Party.

Alexandra Navrotsky (born 20 June 1943 in New York City) is a physical chemist in the field of nanogeoscience. She is an elected member of the United States National Academy of Sciences (NAS) and the American Philosophical Society (APS). She was a board member of the Earth Sciences and Resources division of the NAS from 1995 until 2000.
In 2005, she was awarded the Urey Medal, by the European Association of Geochemistry.
In 2006, she was awarded the Harry H. Hess Medal, by the American Geophysical Union.
She is currently the director of NEAT ORU (Nanomaterials in Environment, Agriculture, and Technology Organized Research Unit), a primary program in nanogeoscience. She is Distinguished Professor at University of California, Davis.
Early life and education
She graduated from Bronx High School of Science in New York. She received B.S. (1963), M.S. (1964), and Ph.D. (1967) in physical chemistry from University of Chicago, where she studied with Ole J. Kleppa.
Career and research
In 1967, she went to Germany at the Clausthal University of Technology for postdoctoral work with Hermann Schmalzried. She came back to the U.S. in 1968 and continued her postdoctoral work at Pennsylvania State University. Then she joined the Chemistry faculty at Arizona State University, for approximately five consecutive years. Later on, she moved to the Department of Geological and Geophysical Sciences at Princeton University in 1985. She became the chair of that department from 1988 to 1991. In 1997, she moved to University of California at Davis and became an Interdisciplinary Professor of Ceramic, Earth, and Environmental Materials Chemistry. In 2001, she was chosen as the Edward Roessler Chair in Mathematical and Physical Sciences. As of 2013, she was appointed interim dean of Mathematical and Physical Sciences in the College of Letters and Sciences, at University of California at Davis. Her specializations include: Solid-state chemistry, Ceramics, Physics and Chemistry of Minerals, Geochemistry.
Geochemistry
Since 1997, she has built a unique high temperature calorimetry facility. She has also designed and enhanced the instrumentation. Navrotsky introduced and applied the method for measuring the energetics of crystalline oxides of glasses, amorphous, nanophase material, porous materials of hydrous phases and carbonates also more recently nitrides and oxynitrides. Obtaining the thermo chemical data is used to understand the compatibility and reactivity of materials in technological and geological application. The energetics provides insight into chemical bonding, order-disorder reactions, and phase transitions.
Navrotsky's calorimetry has also been used in providing thermo chemical data for a variety of perovskite-related phases which has major consequences for convection and evolution on a planetary scale.
One of Navrotsky's works has shown that many zeolitic and mesoporous phases have energies only slightly higher than those of their stable dense polymorphs. The energy is associated with the presence or absence of strained bond angles not with the density.
Nanomaterials
Her research is mainly focused on the structure and the stability of both natural and synthetic nanomaterials along with their dependence of temperature and pressure. She is also looking into the application of nanomaterials in geochemical pollutant transport in the air as it relates to the global climate change.

Cake and Cunnilingus Day is a satirical holiday celebrated on 14 April as a female response to Steak and Blowjob Day, which is celebrated on 14 March. It was created in 2006 by web designer, writer and filmmaker Ms. Naughty and has since been adopted in multiple countries as a day to emphasize female enjoyment and honor women.
Events
On this day, women are supposed to eat cake and receive oral sex (cunnilingus). The event has been created as a female response to Steak and Blowjob Day, observed one month before it. In a similar fashion to Steak and Blowjob Day, which supports breast cancer awareness, Cake and Cunnilingus Day has been intended to support charities such as the Prostate Cancer Foundation.
History
In 2006, web designer, writer and filmmaker Ms. Naughty made a post on her blog proclaiming the day. She wrote, "women should have a day where they get to eat as much cake as they want and enjoy getting their clit licked without hesitation.”
Reception
German daily newspaper Schwarzwälder Bote considered the day to be the equivalent of Steak and Blowjob Day (or "Schnitzel und Blowjob Tag" ("Schniblo") as it is commonly known in Germany), while Stern considered it to be "revenge" for the latter. Online news portal felt that "women are simply great – and therefore cannot be honored and pampered enough days a year. At least that's what they thought when they invented Cake and Cunnilingus Day". The lifestyle magazine Jolie wondered if every day should be Cake and Cunnilingus Day. Swedish night newspaper Expressen and web magazine Nyheter24 stated that it is a day to celebrate female enjoyment, while Göteborgs-Posten listed the day among the holidays celebrated in April. Newsroom platform Mynewsdesk stated: "There is a day just for us girls too." Danish newspaper Ekstra Bladet felt that female pleasure must be prioritized. Norwegian online newspaper Nettavisen stated that "the origin of the day is a bit uncertain, but the day has been marked more or less solemnly for several years".
In Spain, ABC, El Confidencial and La Vanguardia consider the day to be International Cunnilingus Day. Russian news website Life claimed that despite it sounding silly, it can bring happiness to couples. Agency of News Unian suggested one "start with a cake, and a bouquet of flowers". Danish daily newspaper Politiken thinks, "women living such joyless lives that they have to have an annual anniversary in the calendar to eat cake and feel some sexual pleasure". Ukrainian MPort suggested celebrating the day on March 20.
In Italy, various newspapers were confused about the origins of the day. Il Fatto Quotidiano named the day "festa del sesso orale per sole donne" ("oral sex party for women only").
